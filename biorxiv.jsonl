We conducted an integrated analysis of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, mRNA expression, protein abundance and phosphorylation across eight tissues in fifty rats of equally represented sexes following endurance exercise training (EET) to identify coordinated epigenomic and transcriptional changes and determine key TFs involved. We uncovered tissue-specific EET associated changes and TF motif enrichment across differentially expressed genes (DEGs), accessible regions (DARs), and methylated regions (DMRs). We discovered distinct routes of EET-induced regulation through either epigenomic alterations providing better access for TFs to affect target genes, or via changes in TF expression or activity enabling target gene responses. We identified TF motifs enriched among correlated epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations, DEGs correlated with exercise-related phenotypic and cell type composition changes, and EET induced activity changes of TFs whose target genes are enriched for DEGs. This analysis elucidates the unique gene regulatory mechanisms mediating diverse transcriptional responses to EET across tissues.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

The difference between this expectation and the much lower observed molecular diversity is known as Lewontin's paradox of variation. Here, we investigate the effect of genetic draft, a regime of evolution where recurrent sparse selective sweeps entirely drive the diversity of surrounding loci. More specifically, we focus on the neglected distant effect of selective sweeps on remote neutral loci, where the effect of a single sweep is almost negligible. We derived novel mathematical approximations of this underexplored regime and show that under weak genetic draft, diversity at neutral loci is a power law of the population size: Ne({pi}) {propto} N(2A), for A<0.5, where A is the ratio between recombination rate and coefficient of selection (A=c/s). Interestingly the Site Frequency Spectrum at neutral loci is identical to the one produced by genetic drift, as the underlying coalescent tree is an n-Kingman coalescent. In brief, weak genetic draft produces patterns of diversity that look entirely neutral, while being drastically reduced in magnitude. Ultimately, our study points to the need to explore evolutionary models for which diversity looks neutral but does not scale linearly with population size.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

We use the robust locomotory responses of Caenorhabditis elegans to high levels of H2S to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its acute perception and adaptive responses. We find that the H2S-evoked behavioral response is shaped by multiple environmental factors including oxygen (O2) levels and nutritional state, and is modulated by various pathways such as insulin, TGF-{beta}, and HIF-1 signaling, as well as by input from O2-sensing neurons. Prolonged exposure to H2S activates HIF-1 signaling, leading to the upregulation of stress-responsive genes, including those involved in H2S detoxification. This promotes an adaptive state in which locomotory speed is reduced in H2S, while responsiveness to other stimuli is preserved. In mutants deficient in HIF-1 signaling, iron storage, and detoxification mechanisms, animals display a robust initial response but rapidly enter a sleep-like behavior characterized by reduced mobility and diminished responsiveness to subsequent sensory stimuli. Furthermore, while acute production of mitochondria-derived reactive O2 species (ROS) appears to initiate the avoidance response to H2S, persistently high ROS promotes an adaptive state, likely by activating various stress-response pathways, without substantially compromising cellular H2S detoxification capacity. Taken together, our study provides comprehensive molecular insights into the mechanisms through which C. elegans detects, modulates, and adapts its response to H2S exposure.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

N.; Dean, K. P.; Nelson, A. D.; Min, L.; Jenkins, P.

The gene ANK3 has been identified as a risk locus for BD through multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the mechanisms by which ANK3 variants influence BD pathophysiology and treatment response remain unclear. ANK3 encodes ankyrin-G, a protein that organizes the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier by scaffolding ion channels and cell adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton. Recent studies show that ankyrin-G interacts with the GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) to stabilize inhibitory synapses, potentially linking ANK3 variants to inhibitory (GABAergic) signaling deficits associated with BD. We previously demonstrated that the BD-associated variant, ANK3 p.W1989R, disrupts the ankyrin-G/GABARAP interaction, resulting in inhibitory deficits and cortical pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability in mice. In this study, we investigate how lithium, a common BD therapeutic, modulates neuronal excitability in this model. Our findings show that chronic lithium treatment selectively enhances presynaptic GABAergic neurotransmission, reduces neuronal hyperexcitability, and partially rescues AIS length, without altering the density of GABAergic synapses. We also show that the selective glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3{beta}) inhibitor Tideglusib recapitulates the enhancement of presynaptic GABAergic signaling. These findings shed new light on how ANK3 variants may contribute to inhibitory deficits in BD and demonstrate that lithium treatment is able to restore these deficits, likely through GSK-3{beta} inhibition. Furthermore, these findings highlight GSK-3{beta} inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for treating BD and other neurological disorders affected by GABAergic dysfunction.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Directed evolution is a powerful method in biological engineering. Current approaches draw on time-invariant selection mechanisms, ideal for evolving steady-state properties such as enzymatic activity or fluorescence intensity. A fundamental problem remains how to continuously evolve dynamic, multi-state, or computational functionalities, e.g., on-off kinetics, state-specific activity, stimulus-responsiveness, or switching and logic capabilities. These require selection pressure on all of the states of a protein of interest (POI) and the transitions between them. We realized that optogenetics and cell cycle oscillations could be leveraged for a novel directed evolution paradigm ('optovolution') that is germane for this need: We designed a signaling cascade in budding yeast where optogenetic input switches the POI between off (0) and on (1) states. In turn, the POI controls a Cdk1 cyclin, which in the re-engineered cell cycle system is essential for one cell cycle stage but poisonous for another. Thus, the cyclin must oscillate (1-0-1-0...) for cell proliferation. In this system, evolution can act efficiently on the POI's different states, input-output relations, and dynamics on the timescale of minutes in every cell cycle. Further, controlling the pacemaker, light, directs and tunes selection pressures. Optovolution is in vivo, continuous, self-selecting, and efficient. We first evolved two optogenetic systems, which relay 0/1 input to 0/1 output: We obtained 19 new variants of the LOV transcription factor El222 that were stronger, less leaky, or green light responsive in vivo. We demonstrate the utility of the latter mutations for orthogonal color-multiplexing with only LOV domains for the first time. Evolving the PhyB-Pif3 optogenetic system, we discovered that loss of YOR1 makes supplementing the chromophore phycocyanobilin (PCB) unnecessary. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the method by evolving a destabilized rtTA transcription factor, which performs an AND operation between transcriptional and doxycycline input.

These cells exhibit marked tuning curve and rate changes when an animal's environment is sufficiently manipulated, in a process known as remapping. Place cells are accompanied by many other spatially tuned cells such as border cells and grid cells, but how these cells interact during navigation and remapping is unknown. In this work, we build a normative place cell model wherein a neural network is tasked with accurate position reconstruction and path integration. Motivated by the notion of a cognitive map, the network's position is estimated directly from its learned representations. To obtain a position estimate, we propose a non-trainable decoding scheme applied to network output units, inspired by the localized firing patterns of place cells. We find that output units learn place-like spatial representations, while upstream recurrent units become boundary-tuned. When the network is trained to perform the same task in multiple simulated environments, its place-like units learn to remap like biological place cells, displaying global, geometric and rate remapping. These remapping abilities appear to be supported by rate changes in upstream units. While the model does not learn grid-like units, its place unit centers form clusters organized in a hexagonal lattice in open fields. When we decode the center locations of CA1 place fields in mice, we find preliminary evidence of a similar clustering tendency. This suggests a potential mechanism for the interaction between place cells, border cells, and grid cells. Our model provides a normative framework for learning spatial representations previously reserved for biological place cells, providing new insight into place cell field formation and remapping.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we examine the embryonic cortex development of a mouse model that lacks the expression of KIF7 (Kif7 -/-). The cortex is composed of principal neurons generated locally in the dorsal telencephalon where SHH expression is low and inhibitory interneurons (cIN) generated in the ventral telencephalon where SHH expression is high. We observe a strong impact of Kif7 deletion on the dorsal cortex development whose abnormalities resemble those of GLI3-R mutants: subplate cells are absent, the intermediate progenitor layer and cortical plate do not segregate properly, and corticofugal axons do not develop timely, leading to a delayed colonization of the telencephalon by thalamo-cortical axons. These structural defects alter the cortical distribution of cIN, which moreover exhibit intrinsic migration defects and cortical trajectories resembling those of cyclopamine-treated cIN.

Among other results, we find that (i) AleRax, the only method that explicitly accounts for gene tree inference error/uncertainty, shows the best species tree reconstruction accuracy among all tested methods, (ii) PhyloGTP (developed previously by the authors of this paper) shows the best overall accuracy among methods that do not account for gene tree error and uncertainty, (iii) ASTRAL-Pro 2 is less accurate than the other methods across nearly all tested conditions, and (iv) explicitly accounting for gene tree inference error/uncertainty can lead to substantial improvements in species tree reconstruction accuracy. Importantly, we also find that all methods, including AleRax and PhyloGTP, are susceptible to biases present in complex real biological datasets and can sometimes yield misleading phylogenies.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

The barley ROP, RACB, is involved in susceptibility towards infection by the barley powdery mildew fungus Blumeria hordei (Bh) but little is known about the cellular pathways that connect RACB-signaling to disease susceptibility. Here we identify novel RACB interaction partners of plant or fungal origin by untargeted co immunoprecipitation of constitutively active (CA) RACB tagged by green-fluorescent protein from Bh-infected barley epidermal layers and subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Three of immunoprecipitated proteins, a plant phosphoinositide phosphatase, a plant phosphoinositide phospholipase and a putative Bh-effector protein are involved in the barley-Bh-pathosystem and support disease resistance or susceptibility, respectively. RACB and its plant interactors bind to overlapping anionic phospholipid species in vitro, and in case of RACB, this lipid-interaction is mediated by its carboxy-terminal polybasic region (PBR). Fluorescent markers for anionic phospholipids show altered subcellular distribution in barley cells during Bh-attack and under expression of a RACB-binding fungal effector. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylserine show a distinct enrichment at the haustorial neck region, suggesting a connection to subcellular targeting of RACB at this site. The interplay of ROPs with anionic phospholipids and phospholipid-metabolizing enzymes may thus enable the subcellular enrichment of components pivotal for success or failure of fungal penetration.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

This study investigates navigation strategies using data from the large-scale Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) game, in which participants face navigational problems consisting in controlling a boat to reach a series of goal locations, within maps having different shapes. By using a combination of behavioral and computational modeling approaches, we report three key findings: First, participants predominantly use goal-directed strategies compared to visibility-based strategies. Second, participants show signatures of sequential planning, both during memorization - as they spend more time looking at difficult levels - and during navigation - as they show primacy effects, suggesting that they remember better the first navigational goal. Third, our results show a significant age-related decline in navigation performance, which depends both on reduced motor skill - as indexed by poorer control of the boat - and decreased cognitive strategy - as indexed by a loss of goal-directedness during spatial navigation. Unexpectedly, the loss of goal-directedness with age is not associated with a shift to visibility-based strategy or to an incorrect sequencing of goals. Taken together, our findings offer a nuanced understanding of spatial navigation strategies in naturalistic conditions and their decline with age. Our computational approach permits distinguishing motoric and cognitive variables, showing that both decline with age. These results align with and extent previous research on spatial memory decline with age, including potential links to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. The computational models developed in this study provide a robust framework for analyzing navigation strategies, applicable to other virtual environments and video games.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Bacterial colonization of unfamiliar environments constitutes a drastic evolutionary transition, likely altering the strength and direction of selection. This process is often assumed to increase rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), a major driver of bacterial adaptation. Larger genomes are thought to facilitate such adaptations by providing broader functional repertoires and more integration sites for foreign DNA. Here, we systematically test these ideas across a broad bacterial phylogeny linked to environmental transitions inferred from metagenomic data. Contrary to expectation, we find that bacteria entering new environments typically have smaller genomes and experience lower rates of HGT. The reduction in HGT is fully explained by genome size, with no residual effect of environmental transitions once size is controlled for. These findings suggest that successful bacterial colonizers rely less on genomic plasticity through HGT than previously assumed, highlighting gaps in our understanding of microbial evolutionary dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Elevated hyaluronic acid levels and impaired microglial function reduced the clearance of HAPLN2, leading to its accumulation. HAPLN2 oligomers induced microglial inflammatory responses both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, age-associated HAPLN2 aggregation was also observed in the human cerebellum.

M.", "abstract": "During nervous system development, diverse types of neurons and glia are sequentially generated by self-renewing neural stem cells (NSCs). Temporal changes in gene expression within NSCs are thought to regulate neural diversity; however, the mechanisms regulating the timing of these temporal gene transitions remain poorly understood. Drosophila type 2 NSCs, like human outer radial glia, divide to self-renew and generate intermediate neural progenitors, amplifying and diversifying the population of neurons innervating the central complex, a brain region crucial for sensorimotor coordination. Type 2 NSCs express over a dozen genes temporally, broadly classified as early and late-expressed genes. A conserved gene, seven-up, mediates early to late gene expression by activating ecdysone receptor (EcR) expression. However, the timing of EcR expression and, consequently, the transition from early to late gene expression remains unknown. This study investigates whether intrinsic mechanisms of cell cycle progression and cytokinesis are required to induce the NSC early-late transition. By generating mutant clones that arrest the NSC cell cycle or block cytokinesis, we show that both processes are necessary for the early-to-late transition. When NSCs are cell cycle or cytokinesis arrested, the early gene Imp fails to be downregulated and persists in the old NSCs, while the late factors EcR and Syncrip fail to be expressed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the early factor Seven-up is insufficient to drive the transition, despite its normal expression in cell cycle- or cytokinesis-inhibited NSCs. These results suggest that both cell-intrinsic (cell cycle/cytokinesis) and extrinsic (hormone) cues are required for the early-late NSC gene expression transition.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Based on validated linked datasets of influenza virus genomic and wet lab experimental results, in silico models may be of use to learn to predict immune escape of variants of interest starting from the protein sequence only. In this study, we compared several machine-learning methods to reconstruct antigenic map coordinates for HA1 protein sequences of influenza A(H3N2) virus, to rank substitutions responsible for major antigenic changes, and to recognize variants with novel antigenic properties that may warrant future vaccine updates. Methods based on deep learning language models (BiLSTM and ProtBERT) and more classical approaches based solely on genetic distances and physicochemical properties of amino acid sequences had comparable performances over the coarser features of the map, but the first two performed better over fine-grained features like single amino acid-driven antigenic change and in silico deep mutational scanning experiments to rank the substitutions with the largest impact on antigenic properties.

Recent efforts to improve computational models have incluzded training and validation on high-throughput experimental datasets, such as those generated by deep mutational scanning (DMS) approaches. However, DMS signals typically conflate a substitution's effects on protein function with those on in vivo protein abundance; this limits the resolution of mechanistic insights that can be gleaned from DMS data. Distinguishing functional changes from abundance-related effects is particularly important for substitutions that exhibit intermediate outcomes (e.g., partial loss-of-function), which are difficult to predict. Here, we explored changes in in vivo abundance for substitutions at representative positions in the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro). For this study, we used previously published DMS results to identify \"rheostat\" positions, which are defined by having substitutions that sample a broad range of intermediate outcomes. We generated 10 substitutions at each of six positions and separately measured effects on function and abundance. Results revealed an ~45-fold range of change for abundance, demonstrating that it can make significant contributions to DMS outcomes. Moreover, the six tested positions showed diverse substitution sensitivities for function and abundance. Some positions influenced only one parameter. Others exhibited rheostatic effects on both parameters, which to our knowledge, provides the first example of such behavior. Since effects on function and abundance may arise through different biophysical bases, these results underscore the need for datasets that independently measure these parameters in order to build predictors with enhanced mechanistic insights.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

While studies of neutral genetic variation indicate a population decline before extinction, the impact of thylacine-specific ancestral gene losses remains unexplored. The availability of a chromosomal-level genome of the extinct thylacine offers a unique opportunity for such comparative studies. Here, we leverage palaeogenomic data to compare gene presence/absence patterns between the Tasmanian devil and thylacine. We discovered ancestral (between 13-1 Ma) loss of SAMD9L, HSD17B13, CUZD1 and VWA7 due to multiple gene-inactivating mutations, corroborated by short-read sequencing. The loss of SAMD9 correlates with a carnivorous diet, with ancestral gene loss timing mirroring the thylacines shift to hypercarnivory. Our genome-wide analysis reveals olfactory receptor loss and relaxed selection, aligning with reduced olfactory lobes in the thylacine, indicating olfaction is not its primary hunting sense.

For example, while watching a movie we use sensory information from every video frame to construct the current movie scene, which itself is continuously integrated into the narrative arc of the film. This critical function is supported by sensory inputs propagating from dynamic sensory cortices to association cortices, where neural activity remains more stable over time. The hierarchical organization of cortex is therefore reflected in a gradient of neural timescales. While this propagation of inputs up the cortical hierarchy is facilitated by both rhythmic (oscillatory) and non-rhythmic (aperiodic) neural activity, traditional measures of oscillations are often confounded by the influence of aperiodic signals. The reverse is also true: traditional measures of aperiodic neural timescales are influenced by oscillations. This makes it difficult to distinguish between oscillatory and timescale effects in cognition. Here, we analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data from participants performing a cognitive control task that manipulated the amount of task-relevant contextual information, called task abstraction. Critically, we separated aperiodic neural timescales from the confounding influence of oscillatory power. We hypothesized that neural timescales would increase during the task, and more so in high-abstraction conditions. We found that task abstraction dilated the aperiodic neural timescale, as estimated from the autocorrelation function, over prefrontal cortical regions.

Notably, increased inclusion of ARPP19 exon 2 produces the ARPP19-long isoform, which sustains PP2A-B55 inhibition and promotes mitotic progression. A core subset of the K700E-linked splicing changes re-appeared after siRNA-mediated SF3B1 depletion in HeLa cells, underscoring a mutation-dependent spliceosomal signature that transcends cell type. Pharmacological inhibition of DYRK1A or broad serine/threonine phosphatases shifted ARPP19 exon 2 inclusion in the same direction as SF3B1K700E, pointing to a kinase-phosphatase signaling axis that influences these splice events. Functionally, ectopic expression of ARPP19-long accelerated mitotic exit, and high ARPP19-long abundance associated with poorer overall survival in the TCGA-AML cohort. Our findings highlight a connection between SF3B1-dependent splicing, cell cycle progression, and tumorigenesis, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer-associated splicing dysregulation.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we used machine learning to identify computations underlying human gloss judgments from object images, traditionally considered a particularly challenging inference. We rendered thousands of object images, varying in lighting, shape, and viewpoint, and crowdsourced perceptual reflectance estimates for each image. Curiously, gloss judgments were highly consistent with one another, yet systematically deviated from reality. We compared the responses with neural networks trained on two different learning objectives: one set trained to estimate physical reflectance (ground-truth networks) and another to mimic the human responses (human-like networks). By reducing network size, we identified the minimum computations needed for each objective. While estimating physical reflectance required deep networks, shallow networks with as few as three layers accurately replicated human judgments. Remarkably, even a miniscule network with just a single filter could predict human judgments better than the best ground-truth network. The human-like networks also captured known gloss illusions outside the training range. These results suggest human gloss judgments rely on simpler, more general-purpose computations than previously thought, and also demonstrate the extraordinary power of using tiny but interpretable neural networks to uncover functional computations in human brains.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

H.; Ravin, R.; Cai, T. X.; Rey, J. A.; Basser, P. J.", "abstract": "Porous materials, such as biological tissue, often have heterogeneous microstructures where imbibed fluid experiences distinct environments on short timescales, but can exchange among different environments over long timescales. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods such as diffusion exchange spectroscopy (DEXSY) can measure this exchange in water under steady-state and equilibrium conditions; however, modeling becomes more complex when more than two exchanging environments are involved. This complexity is particularly relevant in the central nervous system (CNS), where water diffusion and exchange at the cellular level play critical roles in homeostasis. While DEXSY can measure these processes, they may not be adequately modeled as two-site exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces (ICS and ECS). Here we study the behavior of apparent exchange rate constants (AXR) estimated from DEXSY data numerically simulated using a three-site exchange model (3XM). The 3XM is based on gray matter microstructural characteristics, incorporating both transmembrane exchange between ECS and ICS and geometric exchange between environments within ICS where water mobility differs due to the complex architecture of neurons, glial cells, and the ECS. Inspired by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump-leak model of cell volume maintenance, the 3XM accounts for effects of osmolytes, ions, and voltage on ECS and ICS volume fraction. The model predicts a significant reduction in AXR and a smaller decrease in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) following the level of membrane depolarization expected from Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition. These changes were reversed by the addition of membrane-impermeable ECS osmolytes, independent of voltage, in agreement with previous experiments. While the exchange rate constants for each pathway simply follow first-order kinetics, the AXR's sensitivity to these pathways depends on the ECS volume fraction. When ECS is present, transmembrane exchange dominates, but when cells swell following pump inhibition, geometric exchange becomes the dominant pathway.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular consequences of co-occurring LATE-NC and ADNC pathology (TDP-43, {beta}-amyloid, and tau protein pathologies) remain unclear. Here, we conducted a comparative biochemical, molecular, and proteomic analysis of hippocampal tissue from 90 individuals spanning control, LATE-NC, ADNC, and ADNC+LATE-NC groups to assess the impact of cryptic exon (CE) inclusion, phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology (pTDP-43), and AD-related pathologies ({beta}-amyloid, and tau) on the proteome. ADNC+LATE-NC cases exhibited the highest burden of CE inclusion as quantified by measuring the levels of known TDP-43 regulated CEs within eight transcripts: STMN2, UNC13A, ELAVL3, KALRN, ARHGAP32, CAMK2B, PFKP, and SYT7. While CE levels correlated with pTDP-43 pathology, they were more strongly correlated with each other, suggesting that the molecular signature of CE inclusion may serve as a more sensitive measure of TDP-43 dysfunction than pTDP-43 pathology alone. Unbiased classification based on the relative abundance of these eight CEs stratified individual cases into low, intermediate, and high CE burden subtypes, largely independent of {beta}-amyloid and tau pathology. Proteome-wide correlation analysis revealed a bias toward reduced protein levels from genes harboring TDP-43-regulated CEs in cases with high cumulative CE burden. Notably, proteins significantly decreased under high CE burden included canonical STMN2, ELAVL3, and KALRN, as well as kinesin proteins that are genetically associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Co-expression network analysis identified both shared and distinct biological processes across CE subtypes and pathways associated with pTDP-43, tau, {beta}-amyloid pathologies, and CE accumulation in the hippocampus. Protein modules associated with TDP-43 loss of function were prioritized by integrating proteomic data from TDP-43 depleted human neurons with the hippocampal co-expression network. Specifically, we observed decreased endosomal vesicle, microtubule-binding, and synaptic modules, alongside an increase in RNA-binding modules. These results provide new insights into the proteomic impact of CE burden across the spectrum of LATE and AD pathological severity, highlighting the molecular consequences of TDP-43 dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined higher cognitive function in the valproic acid (VPA) rodent model of autism and tested whether auditory entrainment could improve associated deficits. Pregnant dams received VPA on embryonic day 12.5, and offspring were assessed on a delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task.

Loss-of-function mutations in SLC29A3 cause H syndrome, characterized by hyperinflammation and immunodeficiency. While dysfunctions in various cell types contribute to H syndrome and to SLC29A3 deficiency in mice, the mechanisms driving hyperinflammation and immunodeficiency are incompletely understood. Remarkably, the possible role played by dendritic cells (DCs), the most efficient antigen presenting cells and the main link between innate and adaptive immune responses, remains unknown. We show that, in murine DCs, SLC29A3 is recruited to phagosomes after bacterial capture, maintains phagosomal pH homeostasis, and ensures optimal phagosomal signaling to the production of IL-6, IL-12, and CCL-22. In addition, SLC29A3 promotes Ag presentation on MHC-II molecules to initiate adaptive immune responses. Notably, SLC29A3 supports the activity of the lysosomal calcium channel TRPML1, promoting transcription factor TFEB nuclear translocation and inducing autophagy, a major anti-inflammatory mechanism. Overexpression of human SLC29A3, but not the transport mutant G437R, in SLC29A3-deficient murine DCs restores cytokine production in response to bacteria phagocytosis, suggesting that SLC29A3 transport activity is required to drive anti-bacterial phagosomal signaling. Our data indicate that SLC29A3 plays a dual role in supporting immune function in DCs by promoting effective anti-microbial signaling and Ag presentation and inducing autophagy to control inflammation. Our findings also uncover a novel TRPML1-dependent mechanism by which SLC29A3 activates TFEB and suggest that defects in phagosomal signaling, TFEB activation and autophagy may contribute to immunodeficiency and hyperinflammation in SLC29A3 disorders.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

We identify three parallel pathways, one analyzing whole-field luminance levels, one comparing spatial light levels across eyes, and one computing eye-specific temporal derivatives. Larvae mostly use the latter two spatio-temporal computations for navigation, while juveniles largely employ the first one. We build a library of agent-based models to predict animal behavior across stimulation conditions and in more complex environments. Model-based extraction of latent cognitive variables points towards potential neural correlates of the observed behavioral inversion and illustrates a novel way to explore the mechanisms of vertebrate ontogeny.

Findings from our taxonomic assessment of elasmobranchs landed at the two most important marine fish landing stations in Bangladesh bring new information and insights about the nature of the Threatened elasmobranch bycatch. This study presents findings from a taxonomic assessment at Coxs Bazar and Chattogram, two crucial landing stations in Bangladesh where most shark bycatch landings happen. Over two years, 525 fish were sampled; 206 samples were of sharks, 91 of rays, and 64 of rhino rays, representing over 29 species across 12 families. Among them are 4 families of sharks, 5 rays, and 3 rhino rays. The predominant families observed were Carcharhinidae, Glaucostegidae, and Rhinopteridae. The most frequently landed species were Sphyrna lewini, Glaucostegus younholeei, Carcharhinus leucas, Gymnura poecilura, and Mobula mobular. Out of the 525 samples, 65% (n=340) were female, 35% (n=183) were male, and the rest (n=2) were unidentified. Finding one sample of Pristis pristis indicates the severity of the decline. Additionally, for Glaucostegus granulatus, 12 among the 13 studied specimens were adult females. A significant proportion of the sampled specimens, 45%, were juveniles, while only 24% were adults. This is likely because these fishing boats bringing the catch operate in inshore water and nearshore seas, which are potential nursery grounds. The overlapping of fishing grounds and these critical habitats poses a significant challenge in elasmobranch conservation and hinders population recovery. The high number of juveniles and female adults in the catch reminds us of the necessity of integrating threatened bycatch reduction measures into the countrys fisheries management.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Temperament is known to influence the regulation and expression of emotions. However, how animal temperament affects their vocalisations and particularly their vocal expressions of emotions remains largely unexplored. Sociability is often measured as the behavioural reactivity to social separation and is a temperament trait intrinsically linked to emotional reactivity. Most social species respond to this challenging situation using contact calls. Here, we investigated whether the acoustic structure of these calls reflect sociability, emotions or both. We used 42 female lambs from two diverging sheep lines selected for high or low sociability. High bleats were recorded both in isolation (social challenge) and before receiving a food treat (non social context) to investigate the link between vocalisations, emotions and heritable sociability. The acoustic features of isolation bleats differed between the lines, but it was not the case for pre-feeding bleats. Surprisingly, the genetic selection index and social behaviour were better predictors of the structure of isolation bleats than the arousal. Last, encoding of individuality in isolation bleats was impaired by the genetic selection.

Despite the removal of penicillin from treatment guidelines for gonococcal infections in the 1980s, ponAL421P is present in nearly 50% of current N. gonorrhoeae isolates in the PubMLST database. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that ponAL421P is exclusive to N. gonorrhoeae isolates, whereas Leu-421 is 100% conserved in other Neisseria species. To understand the involvement of ponAL421P in antibiotic resistance, we introduced ponA variants encoding 16 different amino acids at position-421 into FA6140, a penicillin-resistant gonococcal isolate that naturally harbors ponAL421P. Proline-421 was the only mutation that increased the MICPEN to the same level as FA6140. We also assessed the fitness of strains with the 16 mutant ponA alleles over multiple serial passages, both with and without sub-MIC levels of penicillin. There was no fitness defect attributed to ponAL421P under these experimental conditions; instead, our analyses suggest that the widespread occurrence of ponAL421P is driven by its capacity to increase the MICpen above the clinical breakpoint. In FA6140 transformed with the mosaic penA allele from strain H041, a ceftriaxone-resistant isolate, ponAL421P increased the MIC of ceftriaxone, suggesting that ceftriaxone targets PBP1 in this strain. We conclude that the ponAL421P allele emerged in gonococcal isolates, increasing the MICPEN above the clinical breakpoint, and has remained in the population even after the removal of penicillin from treatment guidelines.\n\nImportanceThe emergence of antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae threatens effective treatment of gonorrhea, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide. Understanding the genetic changes that drive and maintain resistance is crucial for anticipating future resistance trends. Here, we investigated the impact of a key resistance mutation in PBP1 (encoded by ponAL421P). Although penicillin has not been used to treat gonorrhea for decades, this mutation remains widespread even in recent N. gonorrhoeae isolates. ponAL421P confers clinically relevant penicillin resistance without imposing an in vitro fitness cost. ponAL421P also increases resistance to ceftriaxone in strains with penA alleles that are associated with ceftriaxone resistance.

Indeed, large screens have revealed extensive microbial metabolism of drugs in vitro, but the pharmacologic and clinical repercussions of microbiota-mediated metabolism in vivo remain to be discerned. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate how human gut microbes contribute to in vivo pharmacology and efficacy of a key anti-inflammatory drug, methotrexate (MTX). Specifically, we demonstrate that the gut microbiome shapes drug pharmacology in vivo in mice, both by directly metabolizing the drug and by inducing host pathways that promote drug metabolism. Moreover, interindividual variation in the human gut microbiome contributes to variation in pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. When we quantified metabolites produced by microbes, we unexpectedly identified novel MTX metabolites, one of which, p-methylaminobenzoyl-L-glutamic acid (pMABG), was a major byproduct of microbial metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. Further, we find that a large proportion of patient-associated microbes are capable of metabolizing MTX. Finally, we show that microbial metabolism of MTX is linked to PK profiles and disease outcomes in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that the human gut microbiome causally contributes to drug pharmacology in vivo for a key anti-inflammatory drug through known and novel mechanisms. Our studies provide a framework for elucidating the clinical relevance of drug microbial metabolism in the context of treatment response. These results are a first step towards understanding and manipulating the human gut microbiome in the treatment of autoimmunity and the advancement of precision medicine for millions of patients taking MTX for immune or inflammatory conditions.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

As the worlds fourth-largest food crop, soybean (Glycine max) possesses multiple strategic values for food security, livestock feed, and industrial raw materials, thanks to its high protein content (accounting for over 40% of the dry weight of seeds) and oil resource attributes. However, the soybean industry is confronted with multiple challenges: the long cycle of genetic breeding (8-10 years required by traditional methods), annual losses from diseases and pests reaching 40% (data from FAO 2023), and the reliance on empirical decision-making in field management, all of which urgently call for intelligent solutions.At present, agricultural knowledge is experiencing explosive growth - more than 4,000 new soybean-related literatures are added annually in PubMed, and agricultural technology Q&A platforms (Zhihu, Baidu Tieba, etc.) generate over 3,000 daily questions. However, this multi-source heterogeneous knowledge is scattered in books, literatures, Q&A communities, and gene databases, lacking systematic integration, resulting in a knowledge utilization rate of less than 30%. In response to this, this paper proposes the \"Fengshu-Agri\" large model, an agricultural knowledge integration and innovation engine based on the collaboration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG). The model achieves breakthroughs through the following core technological innovations:\n\nO_LIDeep integration of multi-source heterogeneous data: For the first time, a systematic integration of 256 agricultural monographs (covering standardized knowledge such as planting techniques and pest control), 66,772 cutting-edge research literatures (genomics, agronomic trait analysis, etc.), 880,000 production practice Q&A (covering scenarios such as pest diagnosis and environmental stress response), and 120,000 gene annotation data (functional genes, expression regulation mechanisms) has been carried out to construct the largest knowledge graph in the agricultural field - containing 2 million entity nodes, realizing full-chain knowledge modeling from molecular-level gene regulation to field management.\nC_LIO_LIDouble-layer collaborative retrieval mechanism: Innovatively integrating RAG semantic vector retrieval with KG structured reasoning to solve problems such as low recall rate (<65%) and semantic ambiguity in traditional systems. Specifically, it achieves dual matching through local keywords (entity-level) and global keywords (relationship-level);\nC_LIO_LIOptimization of domain-specific generation engine: Based on the QWEN-QWQ32B large language model, a three-stage fine-tuning is carried out (pre-training, agricultural instruction fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback) [15], which improves the professionalism of generated texts by 35% (manual evaluation index) and significantly reduces the LLM hallucination problem [12].\nExperimental results show that Fengshu-Agri achieves an accuracy rate of 89.6% in soybean knowledge retrieval tasks (a 25.4% improvement over traditional RAG models), a recall rate of 87.3% (20.5% higher than pure KG reasoning models), and an F1 score of 88.4%. It can efficiently answer complex questions involving multi-entity associations (such as \"the impact mechanism of CRISPR-editing the GmSWEET gene on lepidopteran pest resistance\"). Analysis of typical cases indicates that the models responses not only cover technical principles (sgRNA design, Agrobacterium transformation procedures) but also integrate metabolomics data (70% improvement in insect resistance with no significant yield reduction), demonstrating cross-modal knowledge fusion capabilities. In the future, this model will be expanded to crops such as maize and potato to construct an agricultural intelligent ecosystem covering the entire process of cultivation management and breeding improvement, promoting the upgrading of precision agriculture toward a data-driven model.\nC_LI", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Drought causes complex interactions between root function and leaf photosynthesis, but their underlying mechanisms remain largely unstudied in sugarcane. To address this knowledge gap, we grew up to eight sugarcane cultivars in one field and two pot experiments inside a rain-out shelter. The relative growth rate of these eight cultivars under both well-watered and water-limited conditions was largely explained by net assimilation rate, which depended on bleeding sap rate caused by root pressure. Among the cultivars, Harunoogi--a first-generation backcross cultivar between a wild relative (S. spontaneum) and a commercial cultivar--exhibited improved drought avoidance through adequate root water supply, whereas the commercial cultivar NiTn18 showed the opposite. Throughout the drought and recovery, Harunoogi exhibited significantly higher leaf area, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, and maximum amplitude of the reaction center chlorophyll of PSI than cultivar NiTn18, which resulted in a higher net photosynthetic rate and biomass. These results highlight the potential of improving both root function and photosynthesis as an effective approach to developing drought-tolerant sugarcane.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=93 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/662668v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b41258org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1205568org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c74d95org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b6859a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Despite extensive research on protein S-acylation in animals, our understanding of this process in plants remains limited. In this study, we sought to characterize the S-acylproteome of membrane proteins in Arabidopsis and identify potential substrates for two important plant immunity-related PATs (PAT5 and PAT9). To achieve this, S-acylated membrane proteins were first enriched via our optimized acyl-biotinyl exchange strategies at both the protein-level and peptide-level. The enriched samples were then analyzed by label-free quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results from the two enrichment methods demonstrated that they were complementary in identifying S-acylated proteins and S-acylation sites. Using these methods, over 2500 S-acylation sites in more than 2000 putative S-acylated proteins were identified. Proteins involved in vesicle trafficking, plant phosphorylation, immune responses, and signal transduction pathways were significantly enriched. Additionally, certain amino acid patterns surrounding the S-acylation sites were identified. Comparisons of the S-acylproteomes between the wild type and the PAT5 and PAT9 mutants revealed over 100 potential substrates for both S-acyltransferases. The high quality of our data was supported by the significant overlap with the previously reported data and successful experimental verification of selected candidate proteins. Overall, our study revealed a well-represented S-acylproteome for Arabidopsis (especially its membrane proteins) and identified potential substrates for PAT5 and PAT9.

The analysis of 304 gill samples from 12 hamlet species collected at six locations over 13 years revealed a stark contrast between the gill microbiota and ambient water microbial communities. One novel lineage in the Burkholderiaceae-B family was particularly prevalent across host species, sampling locations and years. Its genome encoded highly complete metabolic modules for carbon fixation and sulfur oxidation, indicating chemosynthetic potential. Its pangenome revealed large-scale geographic structure (western Caribbean, eastern Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico), paralleling the phylogenomic pattern observed in the hamlet radiation. Our survey also identified genomes of multiple novel gill-associated lineages related to known fish gill pathogens, fish gut microbes and free-living seawater taxa. These lineages harbor diverse metabolic modules, involved notably in nitrogen cycling, antibiotic production and biofilm formation, revealing a highly dynamic microbial ecosystem.

A.; Blauwendraat, C.; Billingsley, K. J.", "abstract": "The APOE gene encodes a key lipid transport protein and plays a central role in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. Three common APOE alleles, {varepsilon}2 (rs7412(C>T), {varepsilon}3 (reference), and {varepsilon}4 (rs429358(T>C)), arise from two coding variants in exon 4 and confer distinct AD risk profiles, with {varepsilon}4 increasing risk and {varepsilon}2 providing protection. The {varepsilon}3-linked APOE variant rs769455[T] has also been associated with elevated AD risk in individuals of African ancestry carrying both rs769455[T] and {varepsilon}4 alleles. These single nucleotide variants (SNVs) reside in a cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island, which is a region with a higher frequency of CpG sites compared to the rest of the genome. CpG sites are subject to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) methylation by DNA methyltransferases which add a methyl group to the fifth carbon on the cytosine residue of a CpG site. The presence of SNVs can disrupt this process, making these regions prime targets for differential methylation; however, allele-specific methylation patterns in APOE remain poorly resolved due to technical limitations of conventional bisulfite and methylation array based methods, including degraded DNA quality, sparse CpG coverage, and lack of haplotype phasing. Here, we leverage high-accuracy long-read sequencing data to generate haplotype-resolved methylation profiles of the APOE locus in 332 postmortem brain samples from two ancestrally different cohorts. This includes 201 individuals of European ancestry from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC), comprising 402 haplotypes (48 {varepsilon}2 and 58 {varepsilon}4 alleles), and 131 individuals of African and African admixed ancestry from the Human Brain Core Collection (HBCC), comprising 262 haplotypes (25 {varepsilon}2, 64 {varepsilon}4, and 7 rs769455 alleles). A linear regression analysis identified 18 novel differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) associated with APOE {varepsilon}2, {varepsilon}4, and rs769455 within a gene cluster spanning TOMM40, APOE, APOC1, and APOC4-APOC2. This represents the most comprehensive haplotype-resolved methylation study of APOE in human brain tissue to date.

Beyond their classical role in energy production, they dynamically coordinate processes like pyrimidine biosynthesis and heme metabolism, adapting their functions across the intra-erythrocytic development cycle (IDC). Their unique architecture and stage-specific roles enable the parasite to fine-tune mitochondrial gene expression, which operationally includes both sense and Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs) - a class of long non-coding RNAs. The study involves the analysis of transcriptomic data to identify significant differentially expressed genes, in both sense and NATs categories, associated with severe malaria manifestations. This emphasizes the critical role of mitochondrial gene regulation in disease severity. These genes were statistically ranked and then used as input features for machine learning analysis for verification. Machine learning acted as a hypothesis-testing framework, enabling refinement of gene lists and strengthening biological interpretations. Further, a comprehensive gene enrichment analysis was performed for both sense and NATs to investigate the mitochondrial or other cellular pathways impacted during severe malaria. The findings revealed that NATs have a striking association with mitochondrial pathways and translation machinery, indicating that NATs are not merely by-products of transcription but also play a regulatory role in fine-tuning mitochondrial gene expression with severe manifestation. This work highlights mitochondrial NATs as critical regulators of parasite biology and positions the Plasmodium mitochondrion as a promising target for antimalarial drug development and therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we applied label-free quantitative proteomics to quantify protein-level changes in Arabidopsis thaliana shoots and roots following Pi resupply after prolonged Pi deprivation, quantifying a total of [~]2,700 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Sampling at early (1 h) and late (48 h) time-points, we captured a combination of immediate signaling and metabolic responses, along with longer-term recovery processes. Early responses prioritized metabolic adjustments to restore Pi pools via enhanced glycolysis and energy production, followed by later shifts toward anabolism, including nucleotide production, membrane remodeling, and protein synthesis. Several key enzymes, including ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1A, FRUCTOSE-BISPHOSPHATE ALDOLASE 5, and subunits of PHOTOSYSTEM I exhibited unique tissue-specific and time-dependent regulation.

Our study identifies key regulators of saffrons flowering, focusing on the Florigen Activation Complex (FAC) components: FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), bZIP transcription factor FD, and TERMINAL FLOWER-1 (TFL-1), and demonstrate their temperature-dependent roles in floral regulation. Spatiotemporal expression analyses suggested that CsatFT3 and CsatFD2, expressed in the floral meristem promote floral induction, while CsatTFL1-3 acts as a floral repressor. Protein interaction studies showed that CsatFT3 and CsatTFL1-3 compete for binding to CsatFD2, and their balance modulates floral induction. Functional validation in Arabidopsis and Saffron confirmed these findings. Furthermore, we identified CsatSVP2, an ortholog of SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), as a low temperature-responsive repressor that directly binds the CsatFT3 promoter to inhibit its expression. Together, these findings enhance our understanding of temperature mediated floral induction in saffron and provide insights and lay the groundwork for genetic interventions to enhance yield under variable temperature conditions.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

We compared data generated by community scientists to those gathered by research professionals, estimated relationships between age and task performance, and tested the hypothesis that associations between age and cognitive performance vary by dog body mass, as a proxy for expected lifespan. Community scientists generated similar data to research professionals and both cognitive tasks were sensitive to age-related deficits, beginning in midlife. Relationships between age and cognitive function were highly similar across small and large dogs and, for both tasks, comparison of models with and without an interaction between age and body mass yielded decisive evidence for the model without the interaction. Large dogs exhibit accelerated aging across many traits, and so the lack of evidence for accelerated cognitive aging raises the possibility that their large size confers a neuroprotective advantage.

Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability captures the brain's moment-to-moment fluctuations, offering a dynamic marker of neural flexibility that is sensitive to cognitive capacity. This study aimed to examine intra-regional BOLD signal variability during rest and task across schizophrenia, autism, and typically developing controls (TDC) to explore transdiagnostic patterns of brain signal variability and their relationship with cognitive and functional outcomes. Methods Intra-regional BOLD variability, measured by mean squared successive difference (MSSD), was obtained from resting-state and Empathic Accuracy task fMRI in 176 SSD, 89 autism, and 149 TDC participants. ANCOVAs, controlling for age, sex, and motion, assessed group differences in regional and network-level BOLD variability and dimensional associations with social cognition, neurocognition, social functioning, and symptom severity. Results Both autism and schizophrenia exhibited lower BOLD signal variability than TDC across rest and task, with reduced variability observed in somatomotor, visual, and auditory networks (pFDR < 0.01). Greater network variability was positively associated with better social cognitive, neurocognitive, and functional scores across the sample. Resting-state variability showed stronger group-based differences and cognitive associations than task-based variability. Conclusions BOLD signal variability is positively associated with social cognition, neurocognition, and social functioning across groups, suggesting that variability impacts cognitive efficiency and behaviour. Reduced variability in autism and schizophrenia may indicate similar patterns of neural rigidity among these related conditions, positioning BOLD variability as a potential biomarker for neural flexibility and a valuable target for future transdiagnostic clinical interventions.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Players often rely on caffeinated or sugary drinks to combat fatigue, but regular use poses health risks. Sparkling water, a sugar- and caffeine-free beverage, stimulates brainstem and prefrontal activity via sensory pathways mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the throat. We here tested the hypothesis that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play. Fifteen young adult players participated in a randomized crossover trial, each completing two 3-hour sessions of a virtual football game while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (via a flanker task) were measured at baseline and hourly, while pupil diameter and heart rate were monitored continuously. Blood glucose and salivary cortisol were also assessed periodically. Compared to plain water, sparkling water significantly attenuated increases in subjective fatigue, enhanced enjoyment, and preserved executive function, along with preventing pupil constriction. Heart rate, blood glucose, and salivary cortisol levels did not differ between conditions. Notably, players committed fewer in-game fouls with sparkling water, while offensive and defensive performance remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water alleviates both subjective and objective signs of cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play, supporting our hypothesis.

Transgenic mouse models offer an incredible research advantage to conduct feasible and practical research with the ability to precisely define the progression of neurodegenerative disease over a well-controlled dosage and timeline. The use of transgenic mouse models has been extensive and is critical to advancing research in many ways, including understanding brain morphology and general tissue changes caused by neurological diseases. Often, these studies require specific brain regions or other neurological tissues which may be difficult to obtain. Unfortunately, specific extraction and dissection protocols are few and far between, leading to inconsistent results and a lack of reproducibility. A well-defined protocol, such as this, is instrumental in overcoming these obstacles and acquiring better experimental results. Five mouse-specific protocols are described: brain extraction, brain microdissection, spinal cord extrusion, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) collection, and sciatic nerve dissection. Each protocol was completed under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) guidelines, similar to the sterility precautions required in human surgery. Each protocol also includes a collective materials list that defines proper instruments and usage. The protocol was refined based on feedback from numerous research studies in transcriptomics and pharmaceutical development. These applications require minimizing tissue damage, dissection accuracy, and the ability to reproduce the results, skills that are also directly transferable to clinical settings. The proper implementation of these protocols will allow for more accurate and precise results with reduced variability.

Yet, its influence on emergent dynamical properties is not fully understood. Generally, a key measure of a system's structural impact on dynamical phenomena is its dimension. By tracking the temporal evolution of diffusive perturbations, we estimate a scale-dependent measure of dimension of empirical connectomes. At the local scale, it is highly heterogeneous and follows a gradient from sensory-motor to executive areas. At the global scale, it encapsulates mesoscale topological information related to the balance between segregation and integration. Furthermore, by comparing connectomes from stroke patients, we find that dimension captures the local effects of lesions and, at a global level, is linked to impaired critical patterns and decreased cognitive performance. Overall, the dimension of the connectome may serve as a powerful descriptor for bridging the gap between structure and function in the human brain.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

B.; Dechelotte, P.; Tavolacci, M.-P.; Ribet, D.", "abstract": "Background: Eating disorders are serious pathologies that often begin in adolescence or young adulthood and persist for a significant period of time, with a strong negative impact on patients quality of life and mortality. The etiological origins of eating disorders are complex and involve both biological, psychological and societal factors. The gut microbiota was recently proposed as one of the potential factors involved in eating disorders. To gain a better understanding of the potential role of the gut microbiota in these diseases, we used 16S rRNA sequencing to compare the composition of the faecal microbiota of patients with all typical forms of eating disorders, i.e. anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or binge-eating disorder, with that of healthy individuals. Results: Our results demonstrate that each type of eating disorder is associated with a specific gut bacterial signature. We observed, for example, a decrease in the relative abundances of Agathobacter and Romboutsia genera and an increase in Pseudomonas in patients with anorexia, while patients with binge-eating disorder exhibit a decrease in the relative abundances of Akkermansia and Intestinimonas and an increase in Streptococcus, Eggerthella and Proteus. We also highlight a heterogeneity of gut microbiota composition in different subcategories of eating disorders, such as restricting versus binge-purge type anorexia or typical versus atypical binge-eating disorder. By focusing on the comorbidities reported by patients, we finally identified several bacterial taxa, such as Acidaminococcus and Eggerthella, whose level correlates with the occurrence of anxiety or depressive-like symptoms. Conclusions: Together, our work demonstrates that eating disorders are associated with specific changes in gut microbiota composition and highlight the necessity to finely stratify patients to identify robust microbial signatures. In addition, we identified bacterial taxa correlating with comorbidities and decreased quality of life reported by patients. Our results now pave the way for determining the predictive value of the abundance of these taxa on the duration of the pathology or on the likelihood of relapse. They also constitute a valuable resource to further demonstrate the causal role of the gut microbiota in the onset or chronicisation of eating disorders.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

TET proteins can also oxidize thymine to 5-hydroxymethyl uracil - a modification whose role is still poorly understood. TET proteins add a new layer of information in regulating gene expression, cellular development, and lineage specification. Dysregulation of TET activity is implicated in various cancers, especially in hematological malignancies, where TET2 loss-of-function mutations are prevalent. TET2's role in hematopoiesis is critical, as its knockdown skews progenitor differentiation toward the myeloid lineage and drives carcinogenesis. Therefore, restoring the lost activity of TET proteins is often proposed as an important component of cancer treatment. This study explores the distinct contributions of TET paralogs in generating active demethylation products in malignant cells. It examines whether vitamin C, a known cofactor of many dioxygenases, can compensate for the loss of specific TET paralogs. We applied a highly sensitive and specific methodology (2D-UPLC-MS/MS) to assess TET activity in the HAP1 cell line with single and double TET functional knockouts and in cells with the activity of all TET proteins impaired. Results: Our findings reveal that TET2 is essential for all steps of iterative oxidation, and its loss has the most significant effect on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-formylcytosine levels. Vitamin C enhances TET activity and increases the levels of these oxidation products. However, its effect in TET2 knockout cells is limited; Vitamin C increased cytosine modification levels in TET2KO cells, but not to the extent observed in treated wild-type cells, indicating incomplete compensation for TET2 loss. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that each TET protein has a distinct, separate contribution to generating active demethylation products. The absence of individual TET paralog is linked with the specific pattern of active demethylation products in DNA, which is preserved after vitamin C treatment. Therefore, the deletion of one of the TET enzymes cannot be compensated for by the increased activity of the other TET family members, highlighting the unique roles of each TET paralog in epigenetic regulation.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Axons are the slender, up-to-meter-long processes of nerve cells that essentially wire nervous systems. These delicate structures must survive for an organism's lifetime. Their long-term maintenance requires complex cell biology to be locally present in axons, and this depends on the steady supply with organelles and materials. These are delivered by motor protein-driven axonal transport, which uses continuous bundles of MTs as highways that run interrupted from the cell body to the axon tip. By studying the regulation of these bundles in our past work, we identified many conditions in which microtubules become severely disorganised, a phenotype expected to be detrimental for axons. Further work on these conditions led us to propose the Dependency Cycle of Local Axon Homeostasis model explaining how aberration of different cell biological processes can lead to one common outcome - as is the case in neurodegeneration. Here we put this model to the test. Through live imaging we trace the origins and time course of microtubule disorganisation in normal and mutant neurons, and our findings confirm key mechanisms proposed in our model. Combining published data with the re-analysis and new investigation of 105 gene deficiencies from a wide range of cell biological contexts, we find that ~40% cause the shared microtubule disorganisation phenotype, thus clearly corroborating a key idea of the cycle. Through probing the phenotypes of 18 genes for ROS involvement, we find them to correctly classify into a mechanical ROS-independent versus a physiological ROS-dependent group, providing strong support for a central aspect of the dependency model.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

One such trait is absolute body size, which is commonly used by entomologists to describe species. We propose a novel approach that integrates explicit size information into computer vision models. Our method improves predictions of a Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet) by incorporating the likelihood of an insect belonging to each class based on its size and the size distribution of the training data. We compare the performance of the proposed size-aware approach against a standard ResNet and a feature-fused ResNet model, demonstrating that incorporating explicit dimensional traits, such as body size, can enhance classification accuracy across both balanced and imbalanced dataset scenarios. Our results also show that incorporating size reduces classification error, especially in low-data scenarios and for hierarchically coarse, taxonomic misclassifications (e.g., errors at the family level). Despite being readily available and computationally inexpensive, size has, to our knowledge, not been used in this context before. We show that explicitly including size is both computationally efficient and practical, as it requires no specialized sensors and can be derived from standard image segmentation. This makes our approach highly scalable for automated monitoring of insects with camera traps. By acknowledging the importance of size, our approach also contributes to more robust and interpretable ecological modeling.

To uncover key downstream targets of this fusion involved in cell differentiation, we combined transcriptomic profiling of EwS cell lines following EWSR1::FLI1 inhibition with gene ontology analysis, a clinically annotated gene expression dataset derived from EwS patient material and network analyses. This integrative approach identified inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1, alias BIRC2) as an EWSR1::FLI1-suppresed gene. Despite its known oncogenic role in many cancers, cIAP1 showed minimal expression in EwS. Using inducible cIAP1 re-expression models in EwS cells, we demonstrated that cIAP1 re-expression suppresses proliferation, clonogenic growth, and 3D spheroid formation in vitro. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that low cIAP1 expression enhances proliferation-related gene signatures, which are inhibited upon cIAP1 re-expression. In vivo xenograft models revealed that cIAP1 re-expression significantly reduces tumor growth, mitotic activity, and Ki-67 positivity, while increasing tumor necrosis and apoptosis. These findings highlight an unexpected tumor-suppressive role for cIAP1 in fusion-driven sarcomas, contrasting with its pro-survival function in other cancers. Collectively, our results identify cIAP1 as a prognostically relevant, EWSR1::FLI1-regulated hub whose re-expression disrupts tumor progression, offering a potential therapeutic strategy to restore tumor-suppressive pathways in EwS.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

For this, we selected HLA-A2+ and/or HLA-B7+ donors with and without MS and analyzed HLA-restricted, EBV-specific CD8+ T cells with different fine-specificities using 38 color-based spectral flow cytometry. In contrast to HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells, HLA-B7-restricted CD8+ T cells showed a confined response to EBV, which was mainly directed against latent peptide EBNA3A(379-387). These HLA-B7-restricted EBV-specific CD8+ T cells expressed higher levels of CNS residency markers CXCR3 and CD20 and were most abundant in fresh single-cell suspensions derived from different post-mortem CNS compartments of an HLA-A2+B7+ MS donor. Moreover, HLA-B7-restricted EBV-specific CD8+ T cells displayed a more exhausted phenotype (PD-1+CD244+CD160+KLRG1+TIGIT+) that stood out in the blood from people with MS (pwMS). Accordingly, in the blood, increased IgG titers against EBV were found for pwMS carrying HLA-B7 but lacking HLA-A2, which seemed to coincide with HLA-B7-restricted EBV-specific CD8+ T cells having such an effector phenotype. These data support a model in which the confined response against EBV makes circulating HLA-B7-restricted CD8+ T cells less able to control EBV and more prone to infiltrate the CNS in pwMS.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we identified a synthetic lethal dependency between polyamine depletion and the key ferroptosis suppressor, GPX4. Mechanistically, we show that polyamine deficiency triggers a redistribution of cellular iron, increasing the labile iron pool and upregulating ferritin. To directly visualize this iron buffering in living cells, we developed a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter for redox-active iron. Live-cell analysis revealed a striking inverse correlation between intracellular polyamine levels and redox-active iron at single-cell resolution.

While neutrophil heterogeneity is a topic of increasing research interest, few efforts have been made to model the dynamics of neutrophil population subsets. We develop a mathematical model to describe the dynamics that characterizes the states and transitions involved in the maturation of human neutrophils. We use single-cell gene expression data to identify five clusters of healthy human neutrophils, and pseudo-time analysis to inform model structure. We find that precursor neutrophils transition into immature neutrophils, which then either transition to an interferon-responsive state or continue to mature through two further states. The key model parameters are the transition rates (the inverse of a transition rate is the mean waiting time in one state before transitioning to another). In this framework, the transition from the precursor to immature state (mean time less than an hour) is more rapid than subsequent transitions (mean times more than 12 hours). Approximately a quarter of neutrophils are estimated to follow the interferon responsive path; the remainder continue along the standard maturation pathway.

V.; Vardabasso, S.; Shpargel, K. B.", "abstract": "Many craniofacial disorders linked to mutations in enhancer-associated chromatin-modifying enzymes, including Kabuki syndrome (KS), present with a wide range of skeletal abnormalities. KS is a craniofacial development disorder characterized by mutations in KMT2D, a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase. The KMT2D cellular origins and molecular pathways leading to skeletal deficits in KS are not well characterized. We previously demonstrated that KMT2D deletion in mouse cranial neural crest cells (cNCCs), the multipotent stem cells that contribute to many craniofacial structures, specifically impairs chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation. Although we observed defects in cNCC endochondral ossification, broader skeletal function of KMT2D is largely unknown and its functional redundancy in skeletal development with its paralog, KMT2C, is understudied. We now find that KMT2D mutation within chondrocyte lineages results in postnatal growth defects and impaired skeletal bone development. We demonstrate redundancy of KMT2C in regulating endochondral ossification as mice lacking both methylases within chondrocyte lineages demonstrate severe deficits in bone formation. These methylases regulate change in chondrocyte state as hypertrophic differentiation is impaired with loss of both KMT2C and KMT2D. When both methylases are deleted in stem cell lineages, KMT2C/KMT2D double mutant cNCCs are unable to properly induce chondrocyte factors downstream of SOX9 activation. At the molecular level, there is a loss of H3K4me1 at de novo chondrocyte enhancers essential for skeletal development and an associated reduction in the efficiency of acetylation with KMT2C/D deficiency, suggesting partial dependency on KMT2C/D presence for appropriate deposition of H3K27ac. We propose a role for KMT2C and KMT2D in facilitating proper activation of genes downstream of SOX9 and RUNX2 transcription factors. Thus, we delineate a regulatory cascade orchestrated by chromatin-level modifications wherein KMT2C/D activity ensures commitment of chondrocyte lineages via enhancer priming.

We confirmed that not only plasma membrane-labeled fluorescent images, but also images such as bright-field and cortical microtubule markers -so long as the cell contours can be identified- are amenable to KymoTip. Furthermore, by combining markers for cell contours with those that visualize intracellular structures, it becomes possible to quantitatively analyze various intracellular events, such as nuclear migration and calcium wave, in conjunction with cellular growth dynamics.

Intratumorally, malignant cells predominantly diverged along two differentiation trajectories, converging into osteoblastic and chondroblastic functional states, potentially influenced by hypoxia. Notably, malignant cells exhibited stronger transcriptional clustering by sample-of-origin than by functional state, underscoring that intertumoral heterogeneity exceeds intratumoral heterogeneity. Spatial analysis revealed patient-specific cellular co-localization patterns within the TME, alongside conserved spatial relationships: vascular elements (endothelial cells, pericytes) demonstrated strong co-localization, while immune cells (T cells, myeloid cells) aggregated within shared regions. Crucially, these functional states occupied distinct microniches: osteoblastic regions were enriched with osteoclasts, vascular components, and immune cells, whereas chondroblastic regions displayed inverse cellular composition, preferentially localizing to hypoxic, vascular-poor niches and exhibiting significant enrichment of hypoxia-related signaling pathways.

The Arabidopsis transgenic lines with increased stomatal density were acquired through over-expressing a gene (the homologs of STOMAGEN, FSTOMAGEN, the homologs in Flaveria). The biomass of Arabidopsis transgenic lines with stomatal density raised to intermediate-level increased. Compared to the lines with lowest stomatal density, the biomass of the transgenic lines with exorbitant stomatal density showed no difference, even decrease. There was a positive correlation between biomass and water content, supporting that biomass is affected by water content, and excess stomata do not benefit the improvement of biomass due to the excessive loss of water. During the earlier stage of growth, the leaf growth rate and leaf area of the lines with increased stomatal density was faster and larger respectively, which was in agreement with the notion that more stomata indicated faster CO2 assimilation and then faster accumulation of biomass. Results indicated that finely tuning stomatal density could improve Arabidopsis biomass by genetically manipulating FSTOMAGEN.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown under different glucose conditions, proteasomes undergo dynamic phase transitions between free and condensate states concomitant with nucleocytoplasmic translocation. Low glucose-induced cytoplasmic proteasome condensates are usually reversible but become persistent in the absence of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is important for proteasome condensate dissolution and proteasome nuclear reimport upon glucose refeeding of quiescent cells. Here we found that AMPK activities and the AMPK signaling pathway affect proteasome subunit phosphorylation, which correlates with the solubility and reversibility of proteasome condensates. Nuclear and cytoplasmic AMPK functions redundantly in proteasome condensate dissolution. AMPK interacts with the proteasome regulatory particle in an AMPK activity-independent manner. At least 50 kinases and phosphatases have been found to associate with the AMPK complex. Therefore, the prevention of persistent proteasome condensate formation by AMPK likely results from regulating the antagonistic effects of downstream kinases and phosphatases on proteasome phosphorylation.

Changes in body size of early life stages and small-bodied fish are driven by complex interactions between size-dependent mortality, and temperature- and food dependent growth, and can have consequences for recruitment to the adult stock and food availability to predators. While the mechanisms can be difficult to disentangle using observational data alone, simple indicators such as mean size can provide important information about ecosystem conditions as oceans rapidly change. Using 30 years of observations from the IBTS-MIK ichthyoplankton survey in Skagerrak and Kattegat in combination with sea surface temperature data, we investigated changes in the body size of early life stages and small-bodied fishes for 10 commercial and non-commercial species using geostatistical mixed models, and trends in prey density using generalized additive models. We found positive associations between chlorophyll-a concentration and length in 8 species (3 significant), and negative associations between temperature and length in 9 species (4 significant). Standardized indices of length revealed negative trends over time for all species since 2010, and all species were smaller in 2024 compared to 2000. The decline in size since 2010 varied between 30%-1%, with a mean of 14% and 9% for species predominantly found in Skagerrak and Kattegat, respectively. The trend of decreased body sizes since 2010 coincides with rapid declines in Calanus spp. -- a key copepod prey predicted to decline in this area at the edge of their distribution area due to climate change. In Skagerrak it also coincides with a decline in the density of large copepods (> 0.25 mm). The synchronous declines in larval size across taxonomically diverse species experiencing different rates of exploitation suggest a common response to changing environmental conditions, which could have cascading effects throughout marine food webs.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

M.; Knowles, D. A.", "abstract": "Long-read sequencing (LRS) has revealed a far greater diversity of RNA isoforms than earlier technologies, increasing the critical need to determine which, and how many, isoforms per gene are biologically meaningful. To define the space of relevant isoforms from LRS, many existing analysis pipelines rely on arbitrary expression cutoffs, but a single threshold cannot accommodate the broad variability in isoform complexity across genes, cell-types, and disease states captured by LRS. To address this, we propose using perplexity, an interpretable measure derived from entropy, that quantifies the effective number of isoforms per gene based on the full, unfiltered isoform ratio distribution. Calculating perplexity for 124 ENCODE4 PacBio LRS datasets spanning 55 human cell types, we show that it provides intuitive assessments of isoform diversity and captures uncertainty across genes with varying complexity. Perplexity can be calculated at multiple gene regulatory levels, from transcript to protein, to compare how isoform diversity is reduced across stages of gene expression. On average, genes have an ORF-level perplexity of 2.1, indicating production of two distinct protein isoforms. We extended this analysis to evaluate expression variation across tissues and identified 4,593 ORFs across 3,102 genes with moderate to extreme tissue-specificity. We propose perplexity as a consistent, quantitative metric for interpreting isoform diversity across genes, cell types, and disease states.

Our framework processes diverse SRT data types and detects DSP by performing differential gene expression testing across conditions. Notably, this comparison is not currently available in any other spatial omics method. In addition to detecting DSP across conditions, our framework includes two key features. First, it can identify tissue regions where expression changes across conditions. Second, it can detect spatial gene expression pattern changes across more than two experimental conditions, with flexible models. With ad hoc simulations, we demonstrate that our approach has good true positive rates and well-calibrated false discovery rates.

H.", "abstract": "Collisions between advancing replication forks and elongating transcripts pose a universal threat. During the rapid nuclear division cycles in early Drosophila embryos, coordinating transcription and replication is critical to reduce the risk of collisions. In each cycle, replication begins immediately after mitosis, while transcription starts 3 minutes later, overlapping with replication for the remainder of interphase. We previously showed that transcription depends on the coactivator Brd4, which forms hubs at active genes. Here, we show that Brd4 persists on mitotic chromosomes as bookmarks of transcriptional activity and, upon anaphase entry, recruits the replication activator Cdc7 to specify early-replicating genomic regions in the following interphase. Additionally, Cdc7 activity removes Brd4 bookmarks such that post-mitotic transcription occurs only after a new round of Brd4 hub assembly. Early initiation of replication while deferring initiation of transcription is proposed to allow unimpeded transcriptional elongation behind advancing replication forks. Supporting this, inhibiting Cdc7 delayed replication, stabilized Brd4 bookmarks, and resulted in premature transcription with elongation defects. We propose that Cdc7 triggers a functional switch in Brd4 that enforces temporal ordering of the initiation of transcription and replication, thereby minimizing collisions. This switching process might underlie the widespread correlation between transcriptional activity and early replication.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

While different Wnt proteins share a requirement for palmitoleoylation and the cargo receptor Evi/Wls for their secretion, they interact with diverse signaling receptors and co-receptors to elicit distinct outcomes in signal-receiving cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying this contrast between conserved post-translational modification and secretion and diverse receptor interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt11 maintains partial secretion capability in the absence of Evi/Wls. Unexpectedly, the secreted protein is also non-palmitoleoylated, yet retains its ability to activate downstream signaling in receiving cells through the Frizzled 6 receptor. We identify the N-terminus as the mediator of this unusual behavior, as Wnt3, which strictly requires Evi/Wls, becomes Evi/Wls-independent when its N-terminus is replaced with that of Wnt11. In different cell lines and in Xenopus laevis embryos, the chimeric Wnt11Nterm-Wnt3 protein recapitulates known Wnt11 phenotypes, demonstrating that the N-terminal portion of Wnt11 is sufficient to determine signaling specificity.

A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endoreplicate throughout the flys life, increasing their ploidy and cell volume, while at the same time nearby cells are lost into the gut lumen in an age-dependent process. These cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when endocycling in these cells is experimentally increased or decreased, nuclear and cellular volume as well as peritrophic membrane synthesis is concomitantly enhanced or reduced. Further, we show that blocking endocycling in these cells leads to functional defects in the peritrophic membrane, ultimately leading to increased susceptibility to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function over the course of the adult lifespan.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Despite tremendous achievements in these fields, such as the completion of the first synthetic eukaryotic genome, assembling custom big DNAs remains slow, expensive, and laborious. In this work, we present a set of improvements to yeast-based DNA assembly methods that enable medium- to high-throughput big DNA experiments. In particular, we i) developed two easy-to-use vector systems: Jack In the Box (JIB), which deploys a split marker and split centromere strategy to reduce background, and Selection of URS Recombinational Excision (SURE) which exploits URS silencer removal from the LEU2 marker. These strategies sharply decrease the number of colonies containing an empty vector, greatly reducing the amount of screening required to find correct clones. ii) We improved yeast transformation efficiency, increasing the likelihood that all required DNA segments are co-transformed into the same cell. iii) We developed an automation pipeline for segment mixing through single-colony isolation. We also established three phenotype-driven assays that directly and rapidly report the frequency of correctly assembled large DNA molecules. Harnessing these improvements, we show a high success rate in assembling diverse big DNA libraries by combinatorial assembly and oligo-guided architecture in yeast (OLIGARCHY), a novel method that allows cost-effective reuse of segments for distinct assemblies with reduced effort and cost. Using OLIGARCHY, we designed 96 structural variants of a ~73kb construct, and a single person was able to correctly assemble 90 of these in 7 days, for a total of 7 Mb of assembled DNA.

To better understand the molecular traits that underlie sorghum's remarkable drought tolerance, we undertook a large-scale sorghum gene expression profiling effort, totaling nearly 1,500 transcriptome profiles, across a 3-year field study with replicated plots in California's Central Valley. This study included time-resolved gene expression data from roots and leaves of two sorghum genotypes, BTx642 and RTx430, with different pre-flowering and post-flowering drought-tolerance adaptations under control and drought conditions. Quantification of genotype-specific drought tolerance effects was enabled by de novo sequencing, assembly, and annotation of both BTx642 and RTx430 genomes. These reference-quality genomes were used to construct a pan-gene set for characterizing conserved and genotype-specific expression. By integrating time-resolved transcriptomic responses to drought in the field across three consecutive years, we identified a set of drought-responsive genes that responded similarly in all three years of our field study.

One mechanism of protein oxidation is carbonylation, to which Arginine (Arg) and proline (Pro) are particularly susceptible. Both residues produce glutamic semialdehyde that can further be oxidized to glutamic acid (Glu). Thus, Arg, Pro, and Glu could be interchangeable, suggesting that ROS promote amino acid conversions within protein structures in the biological system post-translationally. Since angiotensin II (Ang II) possesses Arg at position 2, we synthesized peptides that mimic oxidatively-converted Ang II with Arg2Glu and Arg2Pro replacements and examined their effects on gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. RNA-Seq revealed that most genes upregulated by Ang II were not modified by Ang II (Arg2Glu). Ang II (Arg2Glu) modulated other genes such as fibroblast growth factor 10 and phosphodiesterase 6G. While Ang II (Arg2Pro)-upregulated genes corresponded closer to those upregulated by Ang II (wild-type), Ang II (Arg2Pro) upregulated and downregulated many other genes including prostaglandin F receptor and extracellular superoxide dismutase.

While dynamic instability is conserved across eukaryotes, many of its associated conformational changes, like lattice compaction and twist, are not. Tubulin dimers sample multiple conformations in solution and undergo conformational changes during polymerization; the rate and extent of these changes describes their \"conformational flexibility.\" Here, we investigate the relationship between the conformational flexibility of tubulins and the dynamic phenotypes of the microtubules they produce with a comparative study of Drosophila melanogaster tubulin (Dm-Tb) and Bos taurus brain tubulin (Bt-Tb). While these tubulins share high sequence and structural similarity, their microtubules display divergent dynamic phenotypes in vitro, with altered transition frequencies between phases of growth and shrinkage. Dm-Tb microtubules showed drastically longer lifetimes, lower barriers to nucleation, and a high rescue frequency, while maintaining a similar growth rate to Bt-Tb microtubules. 3D reconstruction of mature Dm-Tb microtubules showed high structural conservation with mammalian microtubules. However, when we performed molecular dynamics simulations of free tubulin dimers, we found Dm-Tb to be more rigid and adopt fewer conformational states than Bt-Tb. Biochemical characterizations experimentally confirmed this finding, leading us to hypothesize that differences in the conformational flexibility of tubulins may tune the frequency of transitions between the dynamic phases of microtubules, thereby altering their stability and overall dynamic phenotypes.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

We show here that enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells that evade senescence mis-segregate chromosomes due to defective chromosomal alignment and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, leading to aneuploidy and DNA damage. The chromosome alignment errors are associated with impaired Sgo1 localisation to centromeres and defective sister chromatin cohesion during mitosis. Importantly, all these mitotic defects can be rescued by constraining cell size during the CDK4/6i-treatment, and specifically restoring cohesion rescues the chromosome segregation errors. Together, this demonstrates mechanistically how cell enlargement drives genetic and karyotypic change in cells that re-enter the cell cycle following CDK4/6 inhibition. This could help fuel the rapid emergence of chemotherapy-resistant clones, especially in p53-null cells that evade senescence to drive drug-resistance in patients.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

In our previous study, we showed that short-term treatment with the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel, a P2Y12 inhibitor that irreversibly blocks ADP signaling, reduced the incidence of CAA in the APP23 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease providing strong evidence for platelets to contribute to AD pathology. The objective of the present study was to ascertain whether long-term treatment with clopidogrel and the earlier initiation of treatment prior to the formation of A{beta} deposits prevents pathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. Methods: APP23 mice were treated with clopidogrel for 15 month and analyzed for AD pathology. Results: We detected increased permeability of the blood brain barrier in different brains regions of APP23 mice. Moreover, platelets migrated into the brain parenchyma and accumulated around amyloid plaques in the brain of APP23 mice. Although we detected platelets in close proximity to microglia and neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of APP23 mice, we did not observe any differences in neurodegeneration or gliosis in Clopidogrel treated APP23 mice. Furthermore, pathological analysis showed a significant reduction in CAA and in soluble A{beta}42 levels in the brain of Clopidogrel versus placebo treated APP23 mice but no differences in plaque load in the brain parenchyma.

Under these conditions, organisms must adapt their physiology to ensure proper functioning and survival. While extensive research has characterized how individual cells sense and adapt to low oxygen conditions, the mechanisms that coordinate whole-body responses to systemic hypoxia remain poorly understood. In this study, we uncover an interorgan signaling response mediated by the cytokine Unpaired-3 (upd3) that is important for systemic hypoxia tolerance in Drosophila. We demonstrate that hypoxia rapidly induces upd3 expression and activates JAK/STAT signaling in both larvae and adults. Interestingly, we discovered a sex-specific requirement for this pathway, with females requiring upd3 for hypoxia survival while males do not. We also identify the intestine as a critical source of hypoxia-induced upd3 and show that gut-derived upd3 signals to the fat body and oenocytes to mediate hypoxia tolerance by promoting nitric oxide synthase expression. Furthermore, we reveal an unexpected role for the canonical hypoxia response transcription factor HIF-1/sima as a molecular brake, preventing lethal upd3 overproduction, revealing that hypoxia survival requires precise cytokine dosage control. Our findings define a gut-to-fat/oenocyte signaling axis that coordinates systemic hypoxia adaptation, highlighting the complex interplay between classic hypoxia response pathways and cytokine signaling in maintaining organismal homeostasis during oxygen limitation.

Environmental conditioning, such as intermittent sub-lethal hypoxia, can induce adaptive protective stress responses in the brain. However, whether such parental conditioning enhances offspring resilience to cerebral ischaemia remains unclear. This study investigates whether intermittent hypoxia in parents acts as an intergenerational conditioning stimulus, conferring resilience to ischaemic stroke in offspring, and explores associated molecular mechanisms. Methods: Male and female Balb/C mice (F0) were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (8% O2, 2 hours every other day, 16 cycles) prior to mating. To confirm that intermittent hypoxia induced neuroprotection in the parental generation, a separate cohort of F0 mice underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Offspring (F1) were generated from hypoxia-exposed F0 breeders and divided into four groups: biparental hypoxia, paternal hypoxia, maternal hypoxia, and normoxic controls. Adult F1 offspring also underwent tMCAO to model ischaemic stroke. Infarct volume and brain swelling were assessed 48 hours post-ischaemia. In a subgroup of F1 offspring, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomic analysis of injured brain tissue was performed post-stroke to identify molecular pathways associated with neuroprotection. Results: Parental intermittent hypoxia significantly reduced infarct size and swelling in F0 mice. These protective effects were inherited by F1 offspring, with biparental exposure producing the greatest reduction in infarct volume, followed by maternal-only and paternal-only groups, and exhibiting sex-specific differences. Proteomic profiling revealed distinct treatment and lineage clusters. Key pathways implicated in offspring neuroprotection included metabolic regulation, immune signalling, cytoskeletal organisation, and cell survival, notably involving PI3K-Akt and EGFR pathways. Conclusions: Intermittent hypoxia in parents acts as an intergenerational conditioning stimulus, conferring offspring resilience to ischaemic stroke. This neuroprotective phenotype is supported by coordinated molecular adaptations in key pathways involved in survival and stress response.

One component of lipofuscin is the all-trans-retinal derivative, bisretinoid N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E). Since ocular A2E biosynthesis relies on circulating all-trans-retinol bound to retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4-ROL), we hypothesized that modulating vitamin A receptors, such as the retinol binding protein receptor 2, RBPR2, which regulate serum RBP4-ROL concentration, should attenuate A2E production. In-silico analysis revealed multiple retinoic acid response element (RARE) binding sites on the murine Rbpr2 gene promotor, which was confirmed in vitro by EMSA and ChIP assays. In vitro luciferase assays showed that Rbpr2 promotor activity was induced by exogenous {beta}-carotene (BC) metabolites. Dietary BC supplementation of Abca4-/- mice, a mouse model for STGD1, increased hepatic all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid production, which induced Rbpr2 mRNA expression. This mechanism decreased serum RBP4 protein levels, fundus autofluorescence (AF) and ocular A2E accumulation, altogether improving photoreceptor and RPE function. Conversely, such a rescue was not observed in either Abca4-/- mice fed a diet devoid of BC or in double knockout Rbpr2-/-;Abca4-/- mice. Thus, there was a significant inverse correlation between dietary BC supplementation and Rbpr2 gene presence in Abca4-/- mice, to that of lipofuscin accumulation in Abca4-/- mice on diets devoid of BC or in Rbpr2-/-;Abca4-/- mice. Our results provide impetus to pursue BC supplemented diets as therapeutic interventions for STGD1 patients with ABCA4 gene mutations and identifies a novel role for the vitamin A receptor RBPR2 in this process.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Survival depends upon the Glenn surgery, which shunts venous blood directly to the pulmonary arteries without the support of a pumping ventricle. In the context of this altered circulation (loss of cardiac-driven pulsatility), diverse pulmonary vascular complications develop, severely limiting survival. To date, the relationship between loss of arterial pulsatility and pulmonary vascular changes has not yet been investigated at the cellular level. METHODS: Using combined cardiac catheterization and cardiac MRI, we defined pulsatility loss in three dimensions (flow, pressure, and stretch) in the pulmonary arteries of SV-CHD patients in the Glenn stage. To assess the impact of pulsatility loss on endothelial cells (ECs), we exposed cultured human pulmonary artery endothelial cells to individual dimensions of force. We used bulk RNA sequencing, GSEA, ELISA, and immunofluorescent staining to investigate cellular changes. A rat model of the Glenn circulation was used to further assess the cellular adaptation of pulmonary arteries to non-pulsatile hemodynamic forces. RESULTS: We identify and quantify pulsatility loss in Glenn patients, occurring in all three dimensions of hemodynamic force. We show unique transcriptional signatures of pulsatility within each dimension of force, affecting key structural and signaling pathways in ECs. We identify pulsatile stretch as a critical stimulus for endothelial secretion of PDGFB-a known driver of vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) proliferation and vascular wall recruitment. Moreover, we show that loss of arterial pulsatility in vivo leads to thinning of the vascular wall and reduction of VSMCs. CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies a novel and critical role for blood flow pulsatility in maintenance of the pulmonary vascular architecture. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of pulsatile, arterial forces in maintaining normal pulmonary vascular architecture through EC-SMC crosstalk. Arterial pulsatility is sensed by stretch of endothelial cells and relayed via PDGFB to the vascular smooth muscle, thus maintaining a vascular structure that can support arterial hemodynamic force.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

We show that MYCBP physically associates with itself, Sakura, and Otu, forming binary and ternary complexes including a MYCBP*Sakura*Otu complex. MYCBP is highly expressed in the ovary, and mycbp null mutant females exhibit rudimentary ovaries with germline-less and tumorous ovarioles, fail to produce eggs, and are completely sterile. Germline-specific depletion of mycbp disrupts Dpp/BMP signaling, causing aberrant expression of bag-of-marbles (bam) and leading to defective differentiation and GSC loss. In addition, mycbp is required for female-specific splicing of sex-lethal (sxl), a master regulator of sex identity determination. These phenotypes closely resemble those observed those of sakura and otu mutants. Together, our findings reveal that MYCBP functions in concert with Sakura and Otu to coordinate self-renewal and differentiation of GSCs and oogenesis in Drosophila.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

This combination of phenotypes is interesting because it is consistent with the disposable soma theory of ageing, and phenocopies the well-studied effects of reducing the dietary protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio. Thus, Zn restriction may be a key precision nutrition intervention to extend lifespan. To investigate this, we decided to assess the interactive effects of dietary Zn and P:C ratios on reproduction and lifespan. We found that the interventions interact, producing equally strong, but not additive, effects to modify female reproduction and lifespan. Specifically, both Zn restriction and lowering the P:C ratio reduced reproduction and benefited lifespan, but only when the other nutrient was maintained at high levels. When either Zn or P:C was at intermediate or low levels, adjusting the other nutritional component varied reproduction, but did so independently of lifespan, which remained fixed at a high level. Disrupting the Zn transporter, white, modified the magnitude of some effects, but not their direction. Thus, the micronutrient Zn modifies life-history outcomes to the same extent as altering the macronutrient (P:C) ratio, indicating its nutritional availability is likely to be a key determinant of fitness for Drosophila.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

T.; Ditchfield, P.; Korn, E.; Clements, R.; Chen, X.; Wang, B.; Sheen, M.; Jarman, P.; Han, C.", "abstract": "Mosaic analysis has been instrumental in advancing developmental and cell biology. Most current mosaic techniques rely on exogenous site-specific recombination sequences that need to be introduced into the genome, limiting their application. Mosaic analysis by gRNA-induced crossing-over (MAGIC) was recently developed in Drosophila to eliminate this requirement by inducing somatic recombination through CRISPR/Cas9-generated DNA double-strand breaks. However, MAGIC has not been widely adopted because gRNA-markers, a required component for this technique, are not yet available for most chromosomes. Here, we present a complete, genome-wide gRNA-marker kit that incorporates optimized designs for enhanced clone induction and more effective clone labeling in both positive MAGIC (pMAGIC) and negative MAGIC (nMAGIC). With this kit, we demonstrate clonal analysis in a broad range of Drosophila tissues, including cell types that have been difficult to analyze using recombinase-based systems. Notably, MAGIC enables clonal analysis of pericentromeric genes and deficiency chromosomes and in interspecific hybrid animals, opening new avenues for gene function study, rapid gene discovery, and understanding cellular basis of speciation. This MAGIC kit complements existing systems and makes mosaic analysis accessible to address a wider range of biological questions.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

S.; Korbelin, J.; Trejo, J.; Steinberg, J.; Zemke, N. R.; Lopez-Ramirez, M. A.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are neurovascular lesions that affect both children and adults, and morbidity often results from thrombosis, bleeding, and neurological dysfunction. Studies indicate that inflammation-related activation of endothelial cells contributes significantly to the worsening of CCM disease. This suggests that ongoing vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are key factors associated with thrombosis and bleeding in CCM disease. However, the inflammatory mechanisms leading to altered brain endothelial cell function with a high propensity for thrombosis, inflammation, and dysfunction are not fully understood. METHODS: Multi-omic analyses was conducted by performing simultaneous high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq) with the 10x Genomics multiome platform in combination with immunofluorescence to study CCM pathogenesis in both female and male mice with CCM (Slco1c1-CreERT2; Pdcd10fl/fl) disease. The analysis was complemented with bulk RNA-seq, bulk ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq (Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) using an in vitro human CCM model. An AAV-BR1 viral system selectively upregulates the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor JUNB in brain endothelial cells was used to evaluate its effectiveness in maintaining a persistent activated cell state during the pathogenesis of CCM. RESULTS: We found that epigenetics significantly influences the subtype identity and function of brain endothelial cells within the arteriovenous axis. Through multi-omic analyses, specific regulatory elements and enhancers (cis-Regulatory Elements, cCREs) in mouse brain endothelial cells were identified that influence subtype-specific transcriptional programs and the transcription factors responsible for establishing the various subtypes of brain endothelial cells. Additionally, large-scale epigenomic reprogramming of brain endothelial cell subtypes was observed during the pathogenesis of CCM disease. Among the most significant changes were alterations in the chromatin state of endothelial cells, along with transcriptional processes associated with a persistently activated endothelial cell state, which renders them susceptible to inflammation and thrombosis. The activator AP-1 transcription factor JUNB was identified as a key regulator of the persistently activated endothelial state during chronic neuroinflammation. Moreover, both trans- and cis-regulatory factors conserved between mice and humans were discovered and contribute to the progression of chronic CCM disease. CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetics plays a crucial role in determining the transcription patterns and functions of brain arteriovenous endothelial cells. The activator JUNB is identified as a driver of chronic brain vascular inflammation by inducing a persistent activated endothelial cell state from epigenome reprogramming.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

This highly amyloidogenic pancreatic hormone is co-secreted with insulin, and its elevated secretion can lead to toxic fibrillar aggregation. Despite numerous studies focusing on understanding the molecular mechanisms of IAPP aggregation, few therapeutic strategies exist to counter its toxicity. Urolithin B is a natural metabolite derived from the digestion and intestinal microbiota action on ellagitannin-rich foods. This compound was suggested to counteract IAPP aggregation and toxicity in silico and in yeast models expressing human IAPP. In this study, we focused on the protective potential of urolithin B using our previously characterised transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans IAPP-GFP model. We report that urolithin B reduces the levels of insoluble IAPP-GFP in the body wall muscle cells, while the mitochondrial association of IAPP-GFP remains unaltered. We show that the C. elegans model exhibits a reduced lifespan compared to controls, providing in vivo evidence of the toxic effects associated with IAPP-GFP expression. The lifespans of IAPP-GFP versus control animals were differentially modulated by urolithin B treatment, suggesting an interplay between the metabolite and IAPP-GFP mediated toxicity. To further elucidate the mode of action of urolithin B, we conducted in vitro assays and found no evidence of direct interaction with lipid-associated IAPP, suggesting that its effects are not mediated by interference with IAPP-membrane interactions. These results pave the way for further therapeutic developments targeting IAPP aggregation in T2DM.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

We designed probes sensitive to various IL-1b-activating proteases and applied them to a murine model of inflammatory lung cancer, Kras/Trp53-mutant with SIINFEKL expression (KPS). Our nanosensors revealed reduced cleavage of a caspase-1 reporter in the lungs of KPS mice treated with IL-1b antibody, as well as elevated caspase-1 expression and activity in naive tumor tissue sections, highlighting the importance of caspase-1 processing of IL-1b during cancer development. We conducted a pre-clinical trial of a novel combination intervention by administering both IL-1b blockade and caspase-1 inhibition shortly after tumor induction. Following treatment, we observed significant reduction in lung cancer formation, including complete ablation of tumor incidence in nearly 20% of KPS mice.

Among the chemicals recognised by TAS2Rs there are natural and synthetic compounds including therapeutic drugs. We have shown that TAS2Rs are expressed in the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier where they regulate efflux transporters, thereby controlling the transport of compounds into the cerebrospinal fluid. More recently, we assessed the expression of these receptors in human glioblastoma cells, where 20 out of the 26 human TAS2Rs were identified. In this study, we investigated if temozolomide, the standard chemotherapy for glioblastoma, activates the bitter signalling pathway with impact in its therapeutic efficacy. Notably, we found that blocking the bitter taste signalling pathway significantly reduced the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of temozolomide, and identified TAS2R43 as the receptor mediating these effects. We propose that upon ligand binding, TAS2R43 modulates multidrug resistance proteins (MDRs) activity, facilitating temozolomide entrance into glioblastoma cells. These findings underscore the importance of the taste transduction pathway in evaluating the chemical composition of the glioblastoma microenvironment. Furthermore, our data suggest that TAS2R43 could serve as a biomarker for the efficacy of temozolomide and other drugs that are substrates of MDRs.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we sought to identify epigenetic modifiers that potentiate the antiproliferative effects of retinoids in neuroblastoma. We identified PF-9363, an inhibitor of the histone H3K23 acetyltransferases KAT6A/B, as synergistically inhibiting neuroblastoma growth in combination with retinoids. PF-9363 plus retinoids induces durable growth arrest, which persists beyond retinoid withdrawal in vitro and in vivo with sustained Polycomb-mediated repression of oncogenic transcription factors MYCN, PHOX2B and GATA3.

Despite recent molecular stratification of tumors into distinct classical and basal-like cell states, most tumors are heterogeneous contain of both subtypes. Therefore, therapeutic approaches targeting one subtype may not be suitable for PDAC therapy. Here, we integrated chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), genome-wide occupancy (ChIP-seq) for epigenetic status (H3K27ac) and H3K4me3-anchored chromatin topology (HiChIP) to uncover subtype-independent highly interactive enhancers that interact with essential genes in PDAC. Motif analysis revealed these common enhancers were bound by KLF5 with subsequent depletion leading to decreased cell viability via induction of apoptosis. To elucidate the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms by which KLF5 functions in PDAC, we employed rapid depletion of KLF5 with dTAG technology and profiled the effects on the open and active chromatin landscape and transcription with nascent RNA and mRNA-seq over time. Enhancer inactivation via KRAB domain Zim3-dCas9 fusion protein confirmed KLF5-bound enhancers regulate target genes, including the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2L1.

Both cell types released acetate in response to stretching, but surprisingly, many of the other changes were in opposite directions. For instance, electron transport chain genes were downregulated in ECs and upregulated in muscle cells. Additionally, ECs shifted their transcriptomic profile to a growth-oriented direction and 13C-(U)-glucose tracing experiments revealed increased serine synthesis in ECs. Mechanistic experiments related to the serine synthesis pathway enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) revealed its importance in EC anabolism. Our data suggest that mechanical loading induces cell type-specific responses in ECs and MCs, and several of these effects recapitulate exercise effects in vivo.

Reduced fruit transpiration may limit Ca delivery to fruits, leading to lower Ca content in the fruit and diminished quality. Foliar application of Ca offers a potential strategy to mitigate these effects; however, its low mobility in the phloem often limits treatment efficacy. To address this, we employed X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) to investigate the penetration and transport of foliar-applied Ca, using strontium (Sr) as a physiological tracer. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of osmotic regulators, sucrose, mannitol, glycerol, and potassium, on Ca transport. Results showed that Sr was effectively translocated to distal tissues. While potassium and mannitol had no significant impact on transport kinetics, sucrose and glycerol enhanced Sr movement. XRF imaging of leaf tissue revealed that Sr was primarily transported through the apoplast toward the leaf margin. Moreover, foliar application of Sr combined with sucrose significantly increased Sr accumulation in seeds and in the apical portion of tomato fruits. These findings suggest that, contrary to the common assumption of limited foliar Ca mobility, sucrose, can acts as an effective osmotic regulator, enhancing both short-range movement within leaf tissue and long-distance translocation to fruit.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

In this study, 200 participants (100 with chronic tinnitus and 100 matched controls) completed a battery of cognitive tasks assessing attention, alertness and executive functions, including the Attentional Network Task (ANT), Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) with mind wandering evaluations, Stroop, and Trail Making Test. Tinnitus comorbidities, including hearing loss, sleep quality, anxiety, and hyperacusis were controlled. The results showed that individuals with tinnitus had a reduced sensitivity to alert signals, and lower sustained attention abilities, both suggesting lower levels of arousal. Mind-wandering analyses revealed fewer planning-related thoughts in the tinnitus group, suggesting higher needed cognitive resources to perform the task. Contrary to prior findings, we found no evidence of deficits in executive functioning specific to tinnitus; rather, executive impairments were associated with hearing loss and sleep disturbances.

Here, we examined the impact of dexamethasone on metabolic and functional responses of primary human airway macrophages (AM) from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). We found that dexamethasone significantly reduced basal and compensatory glycolysis in both AM and MDM, and decreased expression of the glycolytic enzyme PFKFB3. Oxidative metabolism was lower in dexamethasone AM but not MDM, indicating different specific metabolic sensitivity of macrophages. Dexamethasone also inhibited the glycolytic response to Mtb and reduced secretion of IL-1{beta}, TNF, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. Dexamethasone-treated macrophages showed enhanced survival following Mtb infection and these cells had a significant reduction in bacterial burden. This antimicrobial effect was impaired when macrophages were pre-treated with bafilomycin A1, implicating that phagosomal acidification may at least in part mediate dexamethasone-induced bacterial control. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that dexamethasone reprograms human macrophage metabolism toward a less glycolytic state while preserving their ability to limit Mtb growth.

In the case of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, numerous studies have documented the domestication of the N2 Bristol strain (isolated in 1951). This has led to a growing interest in recently isolated wild strains from diverse latitudes, which offer insights into natural variation evolution and life-history traits. Here, we compared a recently isolated tropical strain from Mexico City to the N2 Bristol strain. To contextualize laboratory adaptation, we also included the N2 Ancestral strain, a cryopreserved lineage from 1969 with minimal generational drift. Phenotypic assays revealed that, under standard laboratory conditions, the Mexican strain exhibited reduced lifespan and fertility, but enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas the Ancestral strain showed higher oxidative stress tolerance but reduced thermotolerance. RNA-seq analyses showed that transcriptomic profiles of the Mexican and Ancestral strains were more similar to each other than to the N2 Bristol, suggesting that long-term domestication has driven regulatory divergence. Differential gene expression analyses identified strain-specific signatures in stress, immune and collagen-related pathways. Under heat stress, transcriptional profiling revealed that only a small set of canonical heat shock genes was commonly upregulated across the three strains, yet wild strains showed more dynamic regulation, while N2 Bristol exhibited a distinct, possible preconditioned response.

These long-read GRCs are repeat-rich (63-74%), despite their wide variation in size (16-160 megabases), individually distinct gene content, and variable evolutionary histories. These GRCs have accumulated intact long terminal repeat (LTR) endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and their proliferation co-occurs with speciation events of passerine birds. In contrast, normal chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes) are known to purge ERVs through ectopic recombination of LTRs that generate solo LTRs.

We demonstrate that the ligation of PD-L1 on circulating and tumor-infiltrating NK cells with the therapeutic anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab, soluble PD-1, or PD-1+ cells enhances NK cell-mediated tumor clearance via changes in metabolism, adhesion, and migration. PD-L1 engagement increases NK cell tumor infiltration via the CXCR3 pathway and cytoskeletal remodeling, supported by a metabolic shift from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Loss of a key FAO enzyme, CPT1A, in NK cells abrogates the PD-L1-mediated anti-tumor effect, supporting a critical role for FAO in enhanced NK cell killing. The PD-L1-triggered shift away from glycolysis permits NK cells to remain highly effective at tumor killing in glucose-restricted TME. Taken together, PD-L1 ligation enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and tumor infiltration and contributes to NK resilience in challenging TME conditions, resulting in a more effective anti-tumor immunity.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

To better understand bronchial tissue responses to viral infection, we have developed a preclinical in vitro model mimicking the multiciliated airway epithelium, from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and cultured in an air-liquid interface (iALI). By using iPSCs reprogrammed from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we successfully generated a fully differentiated and functional bronchial epithelium exhibiting key COPD features with goblet and basal cell hyperplasia and tissue inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 could infected and replicated for several weeks in both healthy and COPD models, with a recurrent peak at 3 days after infection. Infected iALI exhibited cilia destruction and increased mucus secretion. Innate immune response of different infected iALI reveals a differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Notably, COPD iALI displayed an earlier innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to healthy iALI, suggesting a genetic susceptibility of COPD iALI towards inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a less efficient response to antivirals.

In vertebrates, differentiated cells mainly use type I interferon (IFN) system for protection against viruses, while stem cells rely on IFN-independent mechanisms such as antiviral RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we found that the efficiency of sa-RNAs based on chikungunya virus (CHIKV) or Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) genomes is enhanced when co-expressed in cis with the Nodamura virus (NoV) B2 protein, a viral suppressor of RNAi. In stem cells, NoV B2 prevents Dicer-mediated processing of dsRNA, while in somatic cells, it blocks the translation shutdown caused by protein kinase R (PKR), a key effector of the IFN system. Notably, NoV B2 does not interfere with IFN induction and signalling, preserving sa-RNA's self-adjuvant properties. Mechanistically, NoV B2 sequesters replication-derived dsRNA at the cell periphery, offering a novel strategy to boost sa-RNA efficiency without compromising its immune stimulatory properties.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

Toxic strains isolated in Latin America produce saxitoxins (STXs), which are neurotoxins that block voltage-gated ion channels in cells. This cyanobacterium can exert allelopathic effects on other phytoplankton species in response to resource competition through the secretion of substances that impair the target-cell physiology. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) constitute a secretion system that can transport biologically active molecules to distant targets in a protected, concentrated and targeted way. However, the role of EVs in cyanobacterial biology is poorly understood. We aimed to characterize R. raciborskii EVs and test whether this extracellular fraction or other exudate fractions contribute to its allelopathic effect. Exudates from two STX-producing R. raciborskii strains (T3 and CY-10) were subjected to filtration and divided into vesicular fractions (VF, >100 kDa, with EVs), which were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and dissolved fractions (DF, <100 kDa, no EVs). Characterization of the VF through nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy revealed spheric structures with diameters of 100-200 nm. Ratios of the number of EVs/cell were estimated as 21.54 {+/-} 1.33 for T3 and 8.79 {+/-} 0.38 for CY-10. The STX content of exudate fractions was determined by ELISA. Total extracellular STX concentrations (STX + neosaxitoxin (neoSTX)) were 170.64 ({+/-}15.43) pg.mL-1 for T3 and 913.84 ({+/-}226.87) pg.mL-1 for CY-10 and these values were similar to those of the DF (<100 kDa fraction). In the VF, STX concentrations were approximately 103 - 104 times lower. The estimation of toxin quotas (per biovolume) resulted in values 20-40 times lower in EVs (0.27{+/-}0,09 ng.mm-3 for T3 and 1.81{+/-}0.49 ng.mm-3 for CY-10) than in cells (13.05 {+/-}2.16 ng.mm-3 for T3 and 33.65 {+/-}7.31 ng.mm-3 for CY-10). A shift in the predominant analog between compartments was observed, with neoSTX prevailing in cells and STX in EVs. The CY-10 strain exhibited higher toxin concentrations than T3 in the VF, DF, total extracellular fraction and cellular fraction. The allelopathic effect of R. raciborskii exudate fractions was tested on the green algae Monoraphidium capricornutum. The total extracellular fraction and the DF equally inhibited M. capricornutum growth and photosynthesis, but the VF had no effect. Thus, the effect can be attributed to dissolved allelopathic compounds <100 kDa.

In T. asahii, Cna1 and Cnb1, which are key components of the calcineurin pathway, contribute to various stress responses and virulence. The role of Crz1 in stress tolerance and virulence in T. asahii, however, has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that a crz1 gene-deficient T. asahii mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to cell wall and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The crz1 gene-deficient mutant was sensitive to Congo red and tunicamycin, but not to dithiothreitol or sodium dodecyl sulfate. Moreover, the virulence of the crz1 gene-deficient mutant in the silkworm infection model was reduced. These phenotypes of the crz1 gene-deficient mutant were restored by reintroducing the crz1 gene, confirming the association between Crz1 and these phenotypes. The half maximal lethal dose of the cnb1 gene-deficient T. asahii mutant was higher than that of the crz1 gene-deficient mutant. These results suggest that Crz1 plays a role in mediating the stress responses and virulence of T. asahii.

We previously identified the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Latrophilin-2 (Lphn2) as a junctional protein required for FSS activation of the PECAM1/VE-cadherin/VEGFR2/PlexinD1 junctional mechanosensory pathway, which promotes EC inflammatory activation and atherogenesis in disturbed flow. We now report that Lphn2 endothelial cell specific knockout (ECKO) hyperlipidemic mice develop larger plaques than controls, opposite from PECAM-1 KO mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Lphn2 contributes more than half of the flow-responsive gene expression program but suppresses proinflammatory pathways. The Notch pathway is activated by FSS at EC cell-cell junctions and promotes arterial identity and suppresses sprouting and inflammation. Lphn2 is essential for flow-induced activation of Notch1 but had no effect on activation by ligand. Lphn2 activated Notch independent of its GPCR function and associated with Notch1 and {ramshorn}-secretase in response to flow. Portions of the Lphn2-dependent genes were rescued by expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (22%) and the transmembrane do-main (30%), with both limiting inflammatory gene expression.

To explore the relationship between mtDNA and TL, we used a transmitochondrial cybrid approach, introducing mitochondria from donor platelets with varying TLs into mtDNA-depleted cells. This revealed an inverse correlation between donor blood TL and mitochondrial ROS levels in the resulting cybrids. Under the specific experimental conditions of cybrid formation, characterized by a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, mtDNA variants linked to lower complex I activity triggered rapid telomere shortening, further implicating mitochondrial metabolism in TL regulation. Notably, this effect was prevented by antioxidant treatment and NAD+ precursor supplementation.

To address this, we present the first atlas of invasive plants in mainland Portugal. A total of 96 terrestrial and aquatic invasive plants are represented, encompassing all species listed under Portuguese national legislation and the European Union list of invasive species of concern. Occurrence data were collected from a broad array of sources, including national and international biodiversity observation databases, citizen science data, literature, and data collections owned by managers and researchers, totaling approximately 85,000 records (mean = 879, SD = 1,757 per species). Each species was characterized based on multiple distributional parameters, and a k-means analysis was used to group species with similar distribution patterns. The richness of invasive plants was mapped at the municipality level, and the drivers of their spatial variation were investigated using a comprehensive set of 30 variables representing multiple environmental and human factors. Results show that invasive plants occur in all mainland Portuguese municipalities, but with high variability. Four main patterns of distribution were identified: species that are primarily located along the coast (e.g., Acacia saligna), and a gradient of species with narrow (e.g., Reynoutria japonica), moderate (e.g., Ipomoea indica), and wide distribution ranges (e.g., Cortaderia selloana).

Within three generations, independent populations rapidly and repeatedly evolved increased survivorship, a defining feature of resistance evolution. Adaptive changes in sub-lethal traits such as reproductive output, stress tolerance, and body size occurred with a delayed response following the evolution of resistance. Core microbiome taxa declined following insecticide exposure, and resistant populations evolved to house lower microbial abundances. Axenic rearing and microbiome transplant experiments demonstrated that adaptation via host standing genetic variation was the mechanism for resistance evolution. Microbiome evolution played a secondary and cryptic role in host adaptation by masking slowed development rates that evolved in resistant populations. Together, these results reinforce the primacy of adaptation occurring through selection on host standing genetic variation while also demonstrating the contributions of microbiome evolution in host adaptation.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

We quantified the growth cost of genetically increasing and decreasing mistranslation rates, and exposure to low antibiotic concentrations, in Escherichia coli. Mistranslation costs were generally lower than the cost imposed by antibiotics, and exacerbated in a strain-specific manner under antibiotic exposure. All strains quickly compensated the antibiotic cost during experimental evolution, via antibiotic- and genotype- specific mutations. In contrast, mistranslation costs were significantly reduced only in some cases, without clear causal mutations. Control populations that evolved without antibiotics consistently compensated the cost of accuracy, and evolved increased antibiotic resistance as a by-product. Our work demonstrates that even when the cost of mistranslation is weak, altered translation accuracy can shape adaptive outcomes and underlying genetic mechanisms, with strong collateral fitness effects for apparently unrelated phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Replication of cellular chromosomes requires a primase to generate short RNA primers to initiate genomic replication. While bacterial and archaeal primase generate short RNA primers, the eukaryotic primase, Pol alpha-primase, contains both RNA primase and DNA polymerase (pol) subunits that function together to form a >20 base hybrid RNA-DNA primer. Interestingly, the DNA Pol1 subunit of Pol alpha lacks a proofreading exonuclease, contrary to the high fidelity normally associated with DNA replication. However, Pol delta and Pol epsilon synthesize the majority of the eukaryotic genome and both contain proofreading exonuclease activity for high fidelity. None the less, even the small amount of DNA produced by Pol1 in each of the many RNA/DNA primers during chromosome replication adds up to tens of millions of nucleotides in a human genome. Thus it has been a longstanding question why Pol1 lacks a proofreading exonuclease. We show here that Pol alpha is uniquely capable of traversing common oxidized or hydrolyzed template nucleotides and propose that Pol alpha evolved to bypass these common template lesions when they are encountered during chromosome replication.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

To evaluate statistically significant changes in gene expression, transcript counts between samples are compared using differential expression analysis methods. However, three of the most pressing challenges in transcriptomics analyses are: 1) analytical packages produce a distinct number of differentially expressed genes with varied P-value and fold-change values; 2) the effective use of these analytical packages requires substantial knowledge of programming and bioinformatics; and 3) there are a lack of intuitive methods to select target genes for further investigation in an unbiased manner. To address these challenges, we developed Confidence, a web-based application to perform simultaneous statistical analysis of RNA-seq count data. Confidence incorporates the Confidence Score (CS), ranging from 1 to 4 to aid in gene prioritization, where 1 represents low confidence and 4 represents high confidence. The Confidence web-based application was designed for rapid and intuitive analysis of standard experimental metadata and gene count inputs. Confidence provided a web-based, 'wide-net' approach to differential gene expression analysis. Gene scoring allows for unbiased gene selection and identification of novel genes strongly associated with disease and treatment models across multiple species. Additionally, pathway analysis tools have been integrated so that highly confident genes can be placed into biological context in terms of functions and pathways.

Many biological processes unfold along continuous trajectories, yet it remains challenging to extract smooth, low-dimensional representations from inherently noisy, high-dimensional single-cell data. Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP, are widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions. But they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading interpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus on separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state transitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about cellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build on the Predictability--Computability--Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and reproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular NE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal their key shortcomings such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce NESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE representations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust inference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts, quantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to uncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell data. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, including those about pluripotent stem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific lineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields useful and verifiable biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable cell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.

However, it is unknown if AIP expression in innate immune cells is important to suppress type I IFN in the context of RNA virus infection in vitro and in vivo. In this study we generated myeloid cell-specific AIP conditional knockout mice (Aipfl/flxLysM-Cre) to investigate AIP regulation of innate immune signaling in myeloid cells. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Aipfl/flxLysM-Cre mice had diminished viral replication and increased production of IFNalpha/beta and IL-6 in response to RNA virus infection. AIP-deficient macrophages exhibited increased IRF7 expression and impaired virus-induced IRF7 degradation.

All A. baumannii genomes surveyed encode multiple DcaP family porins, which we classify in four classes based on protein sequence phylogeny (DcaP1-4). DcaP proteins encoded by species in other genera could not be mapped to these DcaP classes and phylogenetic analysis suggests DcaP1-4 proteins diversified within Acinetobacter. Phenotypic array assays and additional experiments show that DcaP3 was necessary for growth on multiple di- and tri-carboxylic acids as sole carbon sources, including citric acid and tricarballylic acid. Finally, a mutant lacking all DcaP proteins was attenuated in the liver and spleen in a mouse model of bloodstream infection and complemented by expression of DcaP3.

Lysosomes regulate cuticle collagen turnover, yet how neuronal signaling modulates epidermal lysosomal function and collagen organization during infection remains unclear. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14-Caenorhabditis elegans infection model, we demonstrate that pathogen-induced neuronal signaling disrupts epidermal lysosomal activity and collagen remodeling. PA14 infection triggers neurons to secrete NSIF-1 (Neuronal Secreted Immune Factor 1), which translocates to the epidermis and impairs lysosomal acidification, maturation, and degradation by suppressing the transcription factor ELT-3. This disruption leads to disorganized collagen structure, compromising cuticle integrity and host resistance. Genetic mutation of nsif-1 restores lysosomal function, enhances collagen density, and improves survival, while neuron-specific nsif-1 deletion confirms its neuronal origin. Moreover, NSIF-1 inhibits ELT-3 nuclear localization, blocking its role in lysosomal-dependent ECM repair. Our study reveals a neuro-epidermal axis wherein pathogens exploit neuronal signals to disrupt lysosomal function and collagen homeostasis, identifying NSIF-1 and ELT-3 as potential targets to counteract infection-driven ECM dysregulation.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used a combination of pollen DNA metabarcoding with real-time nanopore sequencing to assess how FA treatment influences A. mellifera foraging preferences.

We detected a significant difference in foraging composition between FA-treated and control hives at the end of the experiment. Control hives foraged from a more diverse array of plant genera. We also found individual hives have unique foraging preferences independent of treatment. These findings suggest that FA treatment can have an impact on A. mellifera foraging behavior.

We introduce D-BPP, a novel framework that integrates the heuristic D-statistic (or ABBA-BABA test) with Bayesian phylogenomic inference (implemented in BPP) to efficiently infer phylogenetic networks. In D-BPP, we first employ the D-statistic to rapidly identify candidate introgression events on a predefined binary species tree; then we leverage the Bayesian test in BPP to rigorously validate these candidates and sequentially add them to the species tree, retaining only those events with strong statistical support. If the species tree is ambiguous, D-BPP identifies the most probable tree by evaluating competing topologies through Bayesian model comparison of their corresponding introgression models. Critically, our framework excels at detecting ghost introgression, which is often unidentifiable or overlooked by existing methods-whether heuristic or full-likelihood. Applied to genomic datasets from Panthera (big cats) and Thuja (conifers), D-BPP uncovered previously undetected ghost introgression events in both clades, underscoring the pervasive role ghost lineages have played across diverse taxa. By uniquely combining the computational efficiency of heuristic D-statistics with the robust statistical rigor of full-likelihood Bayesian inference, D-BPP deciphers complex hybridization patterns obscured by conventional methods, providing a powerful tool for accurately reconstructing phylogenetic networks.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

This condition often leads to airway obstruction and voice and swallowing dysfunction. This study demonstrates a reliable animal model of ALgI to reproduce the acute wound process seen clinically, to explore the pathophysiology of this disease process, and serve as a reproducible injury suitable for the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. Methods: An ALgI model was developed in New Zealand White rabbits using precise mucosal stripping of the posterior larynx, followed by intubation with an oversized 4.0 endotracheal tube for one hour to mimic intubation-associated trauma and pressure ischemia. Laryngoscopy and laryngeal harvest were performed two weeks post-injury for histologic and immunofluorescent evaluation. Results: Injured rabbits demonstrated an eight-fold increase in posterior glottic thickness (1.57mm vs. 0.19mm in controls; p=0.0004) and eleven-fold increase in collagen content (1.93mm2 vs. 0.17mm2; p=0.005). Collagen subtype analysis revealed a shift toward active collagen within the injured larynx compared to the uninjured, with increased type III collagen (69.0%% vs. 26.1%; p<0.0001) and reduced type I collagen (27.2% vs. 73.9%; p<0.0001) in the posterior glottis, consistent with the proliferative phase of wound healing. Collagen fiber alignment analysis demonstrated increased coherency in injured tissues (0.36 vs. 0.21; p=0.023), indicating early organized collagen formation consistent with scar formation within the posterior glottis.

Often RBPs contain multiple modular domains, which contribute to distinct RNA-binding activity or interactions necessary for regulation. However, assays to determine specific regulatory activity of individual domains are limited. The tethered function assay (TFA) provides a direct method to assess the functional activity of RBPs and their domains. The assay consists of two key components: (i) a reporter plasmid that encodes an mRNA, such as luciferase or GFP, engineered with high-affinity binding sites for an exogenous RNA-binding factor, and (ii) an effector construct that expresses a chimera of the RBP fused to the RNA-binding factor. Co-transfection of these constructs allows for measurement of reporter activity as a quantitative readout for RBP regulatory function.

These cells can be transfected with a single plasmid that expresses an RBP fused to the MS2 coat protein. This approach enhances efficiency and reproducibility through reduction of transfection burden to a single plasmid and simplified normalization.

Zero-shot prompting produced the most reliable results, with Mistral-Small-Instruct-2409 and Nemotron-70B achieving strong balanced accuracy scores of 0.81 and macro F1 scores of up to 0.80, while maintaining minimal invalid outputs.

However, it is increasingly clear that cells relax applied stresses over time and exhibit significant frequency-dependent loss properties, a phenomenon which figures centrally in many biological problems. AFM has been employed to capture these dynamic mechanical properties via microscale frequency sweeps, where the AFM probe indents the sample in an oscillatory fashion over a range of frequencies and the oscillatory sample response is recorded. The relationship between dynamic stress and strain is then used to extract frequency-dependent microrheological properties. Despite the power of AFM oscillatory microrheology, the method remains surprisingly underutilized. This may be due to the traditional call for sphere-tipped AFM probes, which produce comparatively low indentation pressures yet are often expensive to purchase and difficult to fabricate. There remains a need for a framework in which standard blunt pyramidal AFM probes can be used \"off the shelf\" for oscillatory microrheology. In this study, we present such a framing. We derive expressions to extract rheological moduli from the data and explore practical experimental issues such as calibration and parameter optimization, validating the method using agarose hydrogel standards.

Using a 3D laser scanning system, we created morphological reconstructions of the jellyfish before, during, and after swimming experiments. Changes in animal volume were converted to energy consumption using the body chemical composition determined with elemental analysis. Free-swimming, electrically stimulated animals were found to consume 2.5 times more energy than similarly stimulated animals in a constrained environment, likely due in part to additional hydrodynamic drag associated with free-swimming. Simplified drag models could not fully account for the increased energy consumption. This highlights the need for hydrodynamic models that more effectively capture these dynamics. These measurements suggest that this technique could be applied more broadly to measuring free-swimming metabolic rates of other gelatinous invertebrates.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}

In addition to the immediate effects on hormone secretion, nutrients influence EE cell abundance by affecting the determination and maintenance of cell fate. EE cells are known to import and respond to dietary sugars, but how the sugar-induced changes in the intracellular metabolic state are sensed to control the immediate and long-term responses of EE cells, remains poorly understood. We report that the NADH binding transcriptional cofactor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) acts at the interface between nutrient sensing and fate regulation of Drosophila larval EE cells, thus controlling organismal energy metabolism and survival on a high sugar diet. CtBP dimerization in EE cells is regulated through the redox balance of nicotinamide cofactors controlled by glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, allowing EE cells sense their internal metabolic state in response to sugar catabolism. CtBP interacts with the EE cell fate determining transcription factor Prospero through a conserved binding motif and binds to genomic targets controlling EE cell fate and size, such as components of Notch and insulin/mTOR pathways. Collectively, our findings uncover a modality where changes in intracellular redox state serve as an instructive signal to control EE cell function to globally control organismal homeostasis.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}
{"title": "A BASP1/BASP1-AS1 Axis Modulates Wnt and Notch Signaling to Balance Proliferation and Differentiation in Neuroblastoma Cells", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.30.662295", "authors": "KRISHNA, S.; KUMARI, M.", "abstract": "Neuroblastoma exhibits significant intratumoral heterogeneity and resistance to differentiation therapy. We identify a regulatory axis between the protein-coding gene BASP1 and its antisense lncRNA BASP1-AS1 as a molecular switch between proliferation and neuronal differentiation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. BASP1 maintains a proliferative, undifferentiated state by upregulating Wnt3a signaling and stemness-associated markers. Knockdown of BASP1 inhibits both proliferation and neuronal gene expression, implicating it as a context-specific oncogenic driver. In contrast, BASP1-AS1 is transiently induced by retinoic acid (RA) and initiates early neuronal differentiation via DCX and MAP2 induction. BASP1-AS1 represses Wnt3a and activates Notch1, redirecting the signaling balance toward a differentiation-permissive state. A reciprocal suppression between BASP1 and BASP1-AS1 underlies a transition from Wnt3a to Wnt2 activity as differentiation progresses. LiCl mediated Wnt3a activation suppresses BASP1-AS1 and reinduces Sox2, highlighting Wnt3a role in maintaining stemness and therapy resistance. Post RA BDNF treatment reinforces terminal differentiation, defined by high BASP1-AS1, DCX, and MAP2, and loss of proliferative signatures. Together, these findings identify the BASP1/BASP1-AS1 axis as a central node integrating Wnt and Notch pathways to regulate plasticity and lineage progression in neuroblastoma. This axis represents a potential target for overcoming differentiation blockade and therapeutic resistance.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": ""}
