This method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust, and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

While dysregulated immune responses drive chronic inflammation, non-immune stromal cells such as fibroblasts also play a critical role. Targeting fibroblasts could enable tissue-specific therapies while avoiding the systemic suppression caused by current drugs. However, traditional culture systems often induce artificial behaviours, limiting progress. Here, we demonstrate the importance of the mechanical properties of the 3D culture environments in fibroblast-mediated inflammation in the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, a chronic disease that primarily affects joints but also impacts other organs. We isolated fibroblasts from healthy and arthritic mouse joints and expanded them on 2D tissue culture plastic, stiff fibronectin-coated scaffolds, or soft pegylated fibronectin-based hydrogels. Our results highlight the plasticity of fibroblasts, with microenvironmental cues driving inflammatory or regulatory phenotypes. The 3D environment offered by fibronectin-coated scaffolds restored inflammatory gene expression profiles that were lost in flat cultures, while the more physiologically relevant soft hydrogels shifted fibroblasts toward a resolving phenotype. These findings underscore the importance of the 3D environment in modulating fibroblast behaviour and establish a foundation for bioengineered systems that better model disease or guide therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Yet, since the brain is highly interconnected, manipulation of one area can impact behavior through indirect effects on many other brain regions, complicating the interpretation of such results. On the other hand, the often-observed recovery of behavior performance after lesion can cast doubt on whether the lesioned area was ever directly involved. Recent studies have highlighted how the results of acute and irreversible inactivation can directly conflict, making it unclear whether a brain area is instructive or merely permissive in a specific brain function. To overcome this challenge, we developed a three-stage optogenetic approach which leverages the ability to precisely control the temporal period of regional inactivation with either brief or sustained illumination. Using a visual detection task, we found that acute optogenetic inactivation of the primary visual cortex (V1) suppressed task performance if cortical inactivation was intermittent across trials within each behavioral session. However, when we inactivated V1 for entire behavioral sessions, animals quickly recovered performance in just one to two days. Most importantly, after returning these recovered animals to intermittent cortical inactivation, they quickly reverted to failing on optogenetic inactivation trials. These data support a revised model where the cortex is the default circuit that instructs perceptual performance in basic sensory tasks. More generally, this novel, temporally controllable optogenetic perturbation paradigm can be broadly applied to brain circuits and specific cell types to assess whether they are instructive or merely permissive in a brain function or behavior.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

In particular, despite photosynthetic eukaryotes constituting the largest percentage of terrestrial biomass, computational functional characterization of gene sequences in these organisms still predominantly relies on comparisons with Arabidopsis thaliana and other angiosperms. This paper introduces PharaohFUN, a web application designed for the evolutionary and functional analysis of protein sequences in photosynthetic eukaryotes, leveraging orthology relationships between them. PharaohFUN incorporates a homogeneous representative sampling of key species in this group, bridging clades that have traditionally been studied separately, thus establishing a comprehensive evolutionary framework to draw conclusions about sequence evolution and function. For this purpose, it incorporates modules for exploring gene tree evolutionary history, expansion and contraction events, ancestral states, domain identification, multiple sequence alignments, and diverse functional annotation. It also incorporates different search modes to facilitate its use and increase its reach within the community. Tests were performed on the whole transcription factor toolbox of Arabidopsis thaliana and on CCA1 protein to assess its utility for both large-scale and fine-grained phylogenetic studies. These exemplify how PharaohFUN accurately traces the corresponding evolutionary histories of these proteins by unifying results for land plants, streptophyte and chlorophyte microalgae. Thus, PharaohFUN democratizes access to these kind of analyses in photosynthetic organisms for every user, independently of their prior training in bioinformatics.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Laser photoablation-based hydrogel engineering allows the reproduction of vascular networks that are major infection target sites, and this model provides the relevant microenvironment reproducing the physiological endothelial integrity and permeability in vitro. By comparing with a human-skin xenograft mouse model, we show that the model system not only replicates in vivo key features of the infection, but also enables quantitative assessment with a higher spatiotemporal resolution of bacterial microcolony growth, endothelial cytoskeleton rearrangement, vascular E-selectin expression, and neutrophil response upon infection. Our device thus provides a robust solution bridging the gap between animal and 2D cellular models, paving the way for a better understanding of disease progression and developing innovative therapeutics.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

To investigate shared transcriptional features of BrM across tumour types, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from malignant epithelial cells derived from six carcinoma types, including lung, breast, colorectal, renal, prostate, and melanoma. We applied ScaiVision, a supervised representation learning method, to classify tumour samples based on BrM status. The models achieved high predictive accuracy (area under the ROC curve > 0.90) across all six cancer types. This analysis identified a consistent multi-cancer gene expression signature associated with BrM, defined at single-cell resolution. To evaluate the clinical relevance of this signature, we assessed its presence in tumour-educated platelets (TEPs) from blood samples of patients with and without BrM. The signature was detectable in platelet RNA and distinguished patients with BrM from those without, indicating that features of the BrM-associated expression program are reflected in blood-derived material. These findings demonstrate that a transcriptional signature of brain metastasis can be identified across multiple tumour types using scRNA-seq and neural network-based analysis. The detectability of this signature in TEPs supports its relevance in a non-invasive context and provides a basis for further investigation into its utility for BrM risk assessment.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Inhibition of WNK enhances insulin signaling output and insulin-dependent GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane in mice primary neuronal cultures and hippocampal slices.

Using confocal microscopy and histology, we describe H. miamia's reproductive organs, identifying structures previously unknown in acoels. Following a cohort of worms from zygote to adulthood, we quantify the developmental dynamics of their reproductive organs, and find that these organs emerge in a stereotyped sequence as a function of increasing body size. Studying the dynamics of organ growth and de-growth during regeneration and in starvation, we show that reproductive organs follow similar growth rules in these contexts, suggesting that they are regulated by a size-associated program in all growth contexts. Finally, we study egg-laying behavior, finding that H. miamia lay their eggs through their mouths after loading them into their pharynges. Worms lay eggs for multiple months after a single mating, suggesting long-term sperm storage despite lacking a storage organ; we also find that worms can lay viable eggs without mating, indicating a capacity for self-fertilization. Further, we show that worms assess their environment to make decisions about when and where to lay their eggs, and sometimes lay eggs in communal clutches.

T.", "abstract": "To navigate dynamic environments, animals must rapidly integrate sensory information and respond appropriately to gather rewards and avoid threats. It is well established that dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) are key for creating associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict. Critically, it remains unclear how sensory information is integrated into dopamine pathways. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is positioned as a relay for dopamine neuron augmentation. We characterized the anatomical organization and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA and SNc in rats. First, we show that neurons in the deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing with projections to the striatum and ventral pallidum, and these SC projections excite dopamine and GABA neurons in the VTA/SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC[-&gt;]VTA/SNc neuron activation did not reliably evoke behavior in an optogenetic Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, and activation of SC[-&gt;]VTA/SNc neurons did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference/avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC[-&gt;]VTA/SNc neurons evokes head turning. Focusing optogenetic activation solely onto dopamine neurons that receive input from the SC was sufficient to invigorate turning, but not reinforcement. Turning intensity increased with repeated stimulations, suggesting that this circuit may underlie sensorimotor learning for exploration and attentional switching. Together, our results show that collicular neurons contribute to cue-guided behaviors by controlling pose adjustments through interaction with dopamine neurons that preferentially engage movement instead of reward.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that ignoring bulges has led to missing editing at off-target sites in previous studies and that continuing this practice can lead to inflated claims of fidelity. As a solution, we introduce the concept of symbolic alignments to efficiently identify off-targets without sacrificing sensitivity. We further present specialized data structures that enable rapid, alignment-free probabilistic ranking of guide RNAs based on their predicted off-target burden.

Here, we show an unprecedented role for Dmrt2 in regulating the proliferation and neuronal development of cortical neurons in mice. Dmrt2 expression is observed in deep-layer neurons of the cingulate cortex (CgCx) throughout development. Downregulation of Dmrt2 mRNA in the CgCx primordium results in premature cell cycle exit of embryonic progenitors and subsequent reduction in cortical plate cellular density at later developmental stages. Dmrt2 is expressed at higher levels in male embryos during early development, potentially explaining their increased vulnerability to Dmrt2 depletion. As development progresses, Dmrt2 expression is maintained in deeper-layer neurons, where this TF controls distinct terminal processes, including migration, axonal targeting, and neuronal-specific gene expression. Our findings suggest a potential mechanistic link between the function of a Dmrt family member and sex-specific susceptibility to neurological disorders.

Paclitaxel is well-known for disrupting mitosis, yet it also reduces tumour size in slow-dividing tumours, indicating an additional, poorly characterised interphase mechanism. Here, we reveal that paclitaxel induces nuclear aberrations in interphase through SUN2-dependent Lamin A/C disruption. Using advanced optical imaging and electron cryo-tomography, we show the formation of aberrant microtubule-vimentin bundles during paclitaxel treatment, which coincides with nuclear deformation and altered Lamin A/C protein levels and organisation at the nuclear envelope. SUN2 is required for Lamin A/C reduction in paclitaxel and is in turn regulated by polyubiquitination. Furthermore, Lamin A/C expression levels determine not only cell survival during treatment but also recovery after drug removal.

Here, we consider the influence of sensory modality on this process, asking whether stimuli of a non-dominant sensory modality can evoke or influence the fluctuating activity patterns observed for combinations of stimuli of a dominant sensory modality. Specifically, we investigated the impact of combining visual and auditory stimuli on single-unit activity in the inferior colliculus, a predominantly auditory structure, in monkeys performing a behavioral task involving reporting all stimulus locations in a given trial. We found that fluctuating activity is evident when a single sound and a single visual stimulus are paired at the same spatial location, indicating that fluctuating activity can be induced when one item is not from a brain area's preferred modality, and even when only a single spatial location is involved and spatial attention is directed to only one place. Fluctuating activity was also identified when visual stimuli were paired with sounds presented at two spatial locations. The IC appeared to maintain a representation of all stimuli, regardless of the sequence in which the monkey localized the targets (although in one monkey there was a bias toward greater representation of the second reported location). Together, these results indicate that fluctuating activity occurs in response to multimodal stimuli in a predominantly unimodal brain structure and is geared toward preservation of all sensory information rather than attentional filtering.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

However, these findings still leave the unanswered question: What specific features, and in what coordinate frames, drive these egocentric neural responses? Here we present models of the potential circuit mechanisms generating egocentric responses in RSC. One model posits that neurons encode internal representations of barriers in head-centered coordinates, defined by distance and angle, which are modulated by running velocity to enable trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance. We contrast this with a complementary hypothesis in which neurons respond to retinotopic features, such as the top, bottom, or edges of walls, which may serve as precursors to head-centered representations. Additional hypotheses include trajectory-based forward scanning (e.g. ray tracing) for barrier detection or comparing optic flow across the visual field.

In contrast, attempted therapeutic combination with multiple other immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-PD1, anti-Tim3, anti-Lag3, anti-Vista and anti-4-1BB agonist antibody failed due to compensatory mechanisms mediated by other checkpoints on exhausted CD8+ T cells. Specifically, anti-CTLA4 therapy in Kras* targeted PDAC transcriptionally reprograms effector T regs to a naive phenotype, reverses CD8+ T cell exhaustion and is associated with recruitment of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) containing follicular B cells, interferon (IFN)- stimulated/ activated B cells, plasma cells and germinal center B cells to functionally enable efficacy of immunotherapy with long-term survival.

The prolonged association of CLas with the host led to the loss of essential metabolic genes, including transaldolase in the pentose phosphate pathway, hindering the development of axenic culture in the host-free environment. In this study, in silico functional annotation of pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP) protein was performed by utilizing sequence analysis and molecular modeling, revealing its potential role in bypassing the loss of transaldolase. The findings suggest how PFP and fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBPA) can reconstruct the disrupted central carbon metabolism and help CLas in ATP production. The molecular modeling of PFP showed binding affinity towards fructose 6-phosphate and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, showing its dual function. The sequence-based analysis and metabolic modeling study also highlight the presence of other alternate enzymes or transport proteins in CLas, elucidating the broader metabolic resilience. This is the first report to provide the structural insights of PFP in compensating for the lost metabolic function and survival strategies adopted by CLas despite the restrained metabolic capability.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Hantaviruses are zoonotic, tri-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses and a significant public health threat. Viral pathogenesis varies between host species, with rodent reservoir infection being asymptomatic and human infection resulting in severe, immune-mediated disease. Viral pathogenesis is highly dependent on virus replication efficiency since it affects the virus's ability to evade detection and determines the magnitude of the host immune response. While hantaviruses infect many species with variable pathogenic outcomes, their molecular replication kinetics remain poorly defined. Therefore, we developed a sense- and segment-specific quantitative real-time PCR (ssqRT-PCR) assay and a SYBR-based qRT-PCR (Sb-qRT-PCR) assay, allowing us to quantify both negative-sense genome levels and total viral RNA synthesis of the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments of Seoul virus (SEOV). We then measured total viral RNA and genome accumulation in reservoir rat endothelial cells (RLMVEC), non-reservoir human endothelial cells (HUVEC-C), and Vero E6 epithelial cells. We also measured the ratio of each segment released into the culture supernatant, approximating the relative packaging efficiency. We found that viral RNA replication kinetics were largely similar between reservoir and non-reservoir endothelial cells, but that replication and release kinetics differed between infection of endothelial and epithelial cells. We also found that the S, M, and L segments were not equally abundant during viral infection or release, but instead followed a trend of M>L>S. Overall, this study validates two qRT-PCR assays to measure SEOV RNA, details the accumulation and release of each viral segment, and demonstrates the impact of cell type on hantavirus replication.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have shown that trade-offs among different resource utilization functions that cells cannot utilize broad types of substrates at near-maximum speed are crucial for the emergence of diverse strategies. However, in natural settings, nutrient availability often fluctuates over time, imposing additional trade-offs on cells. Cells that grow rapidly under nutrient-rich conditions will suffer a higher death rate under nutrient-poor conditions, creating a growth-death trade-off that intersects with the classical resource-use trade-off. Here, we introduce a unified mathematical model that simultaneously incorporates the resource-use trade-off and the growth-death trade-off. The nutrient supply was modeled as discrete stochastic events, capturing realistic temporal fluctuations. We show that the relative balance between growth and death rates critically influences the dominance of either generalist or specialist strategies. Specifically, under conditions of high average growth rates among different environments and a weak trade-off between growth and death rates, generalists prevail. In contrast, when the growth-death trade-off is intense, specialists emerge as the dominant strategy. Our findings reveal that accounting for the growth-death trade-off is crucial for understanding how microbial communities adapt and evolve in temporally varying environments.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

The widespread availability of scholarly metadata on scientific publications makes it possible to examine how science has evolved over time. Here, we use OpenAlex metadata to examine potential trends in two groups of peer-reviewed research journals: disciplinary journals in biology, chemistry, economics, medicine, physics, and political science, and multidisciplinary journals that publish articles from multiple fields. Supporting existing perceptions, we find an almost universal trend towards increasing internationalization of both sets of journals. Nevertheless, we find disparities: journals in medicine are less international than journals in other disciplines and are not increasing their levels of internationalization, whereas journals in physics appear to be segregating between those that are international and those that are not. We also find that multidisciplinary journals have undergone significant shifts in their disciplinary focuses over the past century, whereas disciplinary journals appear to have largely maintained their degree of interdisciplinarity.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

While some reported successful conversion, others disputed this, citing a lack of neuronal gene expression as evidence of failed reprogramming. This interpretation was further challenged, attributed to incomplete PTBP1 inactivation, fueling ongoing controversy. Mechanistic understanding of the conversion, or the lack thereof, requires investigating, in conjunction with lineage tracing, the effect of Ptbp1 loss of function in mature astrocytes on RNA splicing, which has not yet been examined. Here, we genetically ablated PTBP1 in adult Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 Ai14 mice to determine whether lineage traced Ptbp1 knockout astrocytes exhibited RNA splicing alterations congruent with neuronal differentiation. We found no widespread induction of neurons, despite a minuscule fraction of knockout cells showing neuron-like transcriptomic signatures. Importantly, PTBP1 loss in mature astrocytes induced splicing alterations unlike neuronal splicing patterns. These findings suggest that targeting PTBP1 alone is ineffective to drive neuronal reprogramming and highlight the need for combining splicing and lineage analyses. Loss of astrocytic PTBP1 is insufficient to induce neuronal splicing, contrasting with its well-known role in other non-neuronal cells, and instead affects a distinct astrocytic splicing program.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Retrospective analyses indicate that some groups, such as birds, fishes and insects, have experienced significant declines in recent decades. Broader investigations, on the other hand, reveal a more complex picture, with declines and increases roughly balanced. Here, we address the prospective task to statistically forecast biodiversity trends and assess our ability to do so based on available data. We analyzed approximately 43,000 population-level and 10,000 community-level time series from localities across the globe and covering taxa across the Tree of Life. Using unobserved components models and model selection, we found that only 23.5% of wild populations exhibit forecasted time trends (increasing and decreasing ones roughly balanced), while 76.5% show a forecasted constant mean. For communities (temporal - and {beta}-diversity), this figure rises to 84.0%. To explore the underlying reasons for the high prevalence of forecasted constant means, we used machine learning techniques (random forest models and SHAP analysis). We identified high variation in the rate of change (RoC) in the time series as the most important predictor of a forecasted constant mean. Further, life-history traits and locality accounted for 39.6% of the variation in the RoC variance of anmiotes, and sampling unit explained 44.4% of that variability for dicot plants. In summary, despite time trends being identifiable in ecological time-series data, parsimonious statistical models will very often suggest a forecasted constant mean.

We investigated brain signals captured by using EEG during hour long smartphone use sessions (n = 53 subjects, accumulating 136,869 interactions). We grouped the brain signals according to the transition patterns between consecutive touchscreen intervals (next-interval statistics), resulting in a matrix of EEG signals. Using data-driven dimensionality reduction on this matrix, we identified low-dimensional neuro-behavioral clusters that captured brain signal features associated with specific next-interval statistics. These neuro-behavioral clusters were found in diverse cortical locations spanning occipital, parietal and frontal cortices, suggesting a cortex-wide alignment to the next-interval statistics. Notably, these clusters were observed predominantly before rather than after the touchscreen interactions and they varied across individuals, suggesting personalized strategies for planning and executing smartphone use. Our findings indicate that the brain tracks and adapts to the fine-grained temporal patterns in touchscreen behavior, likely to support efficient smartphone interactions. More broadly, this work demonstrates how naturalistic smartphone use can be used to reveal cortical states aligned to real-world temporal structures.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

This study introduces CATERPillar (Computational Axonal Threading Engine for Realistic Proliferation), a novel method that simulates the mechanic of axonal growth using overlapping spheres as elementary units. CATERPillar facilitates parallel axon development while preventing collisions, offering user control over key structural parameters such as cellular density, tortuosity, beading and myelination.

The structural realism of the astrocytic components was quantitatively validated using Sholl analysis. Furthermore, the time-dependent diffusion in the extra- and intra-axonal compartments accurately reflected expected characteristics of short-range disorder, as predicted by theoretical models.

While much of our understanding of Pa biofilms comes from surface-attached models, recent studies have emphasized the clinical relevance of suspended bacterial aggregates - dense, three-dimensional clusters that form early during infection and exhibit key biofilm-like properties. However, the physical characteristics of these aggregates remain poorly defined. Here, we apply atomic force microscopy (AFM) to visualize and quantify the structural and mechanical properties of Pa aggregates formed in synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum medium (SCFM2). Compared to planktonic cultures grown without mucin, aggregates formed in SCFM2 exhibited complex architecture and increased resistance to deformation, as measured by force spectroscopy. These differences emerged despite the absence of mature extracellular matrix components, suggesting that environmental cues and spatial organization alone may be sufficient to enhance aggregate mechanical resilience. Our results demonstrate that AFM provides a powerful, high-resolution approach for studying early-stage bacterial aggregates under physiologically relevant conditions. By resolving structural features and quantifying localized mechanical strength, this method offers new insight into how aggregate architecture contributes to persistence during chronic infection. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies targeting the physical robustness of bacterial communities as an early vulnerability in the pathogenesis of Pa both in CF and in other infection settings.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Beyond their classical role in energy production, they dynamically coordinate processes like pyrimidine biosynthesis and heme metabolism, adapting their functions across the intra-erythrocytic development cycle (IDC). Their unique architecture and stage-specific roles enable the parasite to fine-tune mitochondrial gene expression, involving both protein-coding sense transcripts and long non-coding natural antisense transcripts (NATs). This study unveils an unprecedented regulatory complexity by integrating transcriptomic profiling with advanced machine learning to decode the role of mitochondrial sense and natural antisense transcripts (NATs) in severe P. vivax malaria. We reveal distinct, clinically relevant expression signatures, where NATs emerge not as transcriptional by-products but as potent regulators tightly linked to mitochondrial pathways and translational machinery. This dual-layered transcriptomic landscape reflects an intricate molecular strategy by which the parasite fine-tunes mitochondrial function to survive under severe disease conditions. Importantly, while these findings illuminate novel regulatory mechanisms and position mitochondrial NATs as promising targets for antimalarial drug development, they represent preliminary insights derived from a limited clinical cohort and should not be interpreted as definitive clinical indicators. Validation in larger and diverse patient populations is essential to confirm their broader biological and clinical relevance.

Ensembles of multiple individual genomic prediction models can be a potential alternative approach. The framework of the Diversity Prediction Theorem suggests the potential for a reduction in prediction error with the inclusion of diverse prediction models in the ensemble. We investigated the performance of an ensemble approach that combines multiple genomic prediction models. We demonstrate the results using flowering time traits measured in two maize Nested Association Mapping datasets. For both datasets, the ensemble-based prediction approach achieved the highest prediction accuracy and lowest prediction error across traits. Multiple genomic regions containing key flowering time-related genes were captured by the different genomic prediction models with diverse weights, demonstrating different views of the trait genetic architecture. The combination of such diverse views contributed to the improvement of prediction performance by the ensemble-based approach over the individual prediction models.

Tau is a prominent member of the IDP family which sees its cellular function regulated by multiple phosphorylations sites, and whose hyperphosphorylation is involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. We use coarse-grain MD simulations with the CALVADOS model to investigate the conformational landscape of tau without and with phosphorylations. Characterizing the local compacity of IDPs allows us to highlight how disorder comes in various flavors, as we can define different domains along the tau sequence. We define the IDP's Statistical Tertiary Organization (STO) as the average spatial arrangements of domains, which constitutes an extension of the tertiary structure of folded proteins. We also use IDP specific metrics to characterize the local curvature and flexibility of tau. Comparing the local flexibilities with T2 relaxation times from NMR experiments, we show how this metric is related to the protein dynamics. A curvature and flexibility pattern in the repeat domains can also be connected to tau binding properties, without having to explicitly model the protein's interaction partner. Finally, we rediscuss the original paperclip model that describes the spatial organization of tau, and how phosphorylations impact it.

However, the computational demands of paratope networks hinder their use on large datasets and multi-disease classification. Methods: We reanalyzed publicly available T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data from 1,421 donors across 15 disease groups and a large control group, encompassing approximately 81 million TCR sequences. To address computational bottlenecks, we replaced the paratope-similarity network approach (Paratope Cluster Occupancy or PCO) with a new Fast Approximate Clustering Techniques (FACTS) pipeline, which is comprised of four main steps: (1) high-dimensional vector encoding of sequences; (2) efficient clustering of the resulting vectors; (3) donor-level feature construction from cluster distributions; and (4) gradient-boosted decision tree classification for multi-class disease prediction. Findings: FACTS processed 10 sequences in under 120 CPU hours. Using only TCR data, and evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation, it achieved a mean ROC AUC of 0.99 across 16 disease classes. Compared with the recently reported Mal-ID model, FACTS achieved higher donor-level classification accuracy for BCR (0.840 vs. 0.740), TCR (0.882 vs. 0.751), and combined BCR+TCR datasets (0.904 vs. 0.853) on the six-class Mal-ID benchmark.

Circuit space is defined by a library of experimentally characterized parts and dynamical systems models for gene expression in a heterogeneous cell population.

The transcriptional responses of eight genes potentially related to stress adaptation were analyzed in two strains acclimated at 18 and 21 Celsius. Gene expression was assessed at the start (time zero) and after 48 hours of acclimation. Following acclimation, the cells were inoculated into sterile Pinot noir wine, and malolactic fermentation (MLF) was monitored over 19 days to determine whether acclimation temperature influenced cell survival and fermentation performance. Both strains exhibited similar L-malic acid consumption and survival patterns, although transcriptional responses varied depending on the temperature. Notably, gapB, glmS, and rfbB emerged as promising gene markers for future studies. These findings suggest that gene expression profiling of acclimated cells may support the selection of robust Lpb. plantarum strains for use as starter cultures in winemaking.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

I build upon a spatially-explicit phenotypic model that I have previously presented. The model incorporates both phenotypic sorting and gene swamping, and is used to study constant advective dispersal and trait-based habitat choice. Through analytical arguments on characteristic lengths and speeds, as well as by direct numerical solutions, I find that, in eco-evo scenarios, advective dispersal has two opposing effects on pulled invasion fronts. In shallow environmental gradients, the demographic effect of simply adding to the steady-state invasion speed dominates. As gradients get steeper, asymmetric gene flow, due to advective dispersal, becomes increasingly stronger, pulling the invasion front in an opposite direction. Steep gradients cause front reversals, where species ranges, counter-intuitively, slide upstream. Symmetry between velocity of advective dispersal and velocity of climate change leads to adaptation lags, abundance profiles, and invasion speeds that depend only on the velocity difference. Through characteristic lengths and speeds, I also identify similarity between demographic and evolutionary averaging or tracking of environmental heterogeneity. I connect climate change research to demographic models of persistence in advective environments -- the so-called drift paradox. I additionally derive dimensionless ratios that have potential in facilitating comparisons among different species, populations, traits and locales, and in guiding micro- and mesocosm experiments and space-for-time substitutions. As an aside, I demonstrate how numerical solution and simulation of complex eco-evo models can be accelerated with GPU programming.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

While PD progression is thought to be driven by a prion-like spread of Syn aggregates between neurons, the role of astrocytes remains unclear. Observations of Syn pathology in PD patient astrocytes suggest their potential involvement in processing aggregates. To investigate this, we studied astrocytes' interactions with Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) and their effects in astrocyte-neuron co-cultures on the spread of seed-competent Syn. Primary astrocytes quickly internalized and degraded Syn PFFs. However, degradation was significantly hindered by lysosome-compromising agents like chloroquine, Leupeptin, or CA-074. Adding astrocytes to neuron cultures reduced endogenous Syn aggregation, indicating their role in mitigating Syn pathology. When lysosome efficiency in astrocytes was compromised, their anti-seeding effect diminished. Moreover, lysosome-compromised astrocytes preloaded with Syn PFFs enhanced Syn pathology in neurons, whereas unimpaired astrocytes did not. These findings suggest astrocytes can modulate and contribute to Syn pathology spread, playing a significant role in PD pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

We previously conducted a co-evolutionary experiment using an RNA-protein replication system that resulted in the spontaneous diversification of host and parasitic RNA into five distinct lineages with robust co-replication. Here, we report contrasting evolutionary outcomes from a second long-term co-evolutionary experiment. Using a flow reactor system with increased dilution frequency over 5000 h (15,000 generations), we observed reduced diversity and frequent extinctions in later experimental stages. Co-replication assays of RNA clones revealed that the primary cause of this diversity loss was shortened reaction time due to frequent dilution. Further analysis of RNA clones that emerged during evolution suggested that the frequent extinctions resulted from the dominance of host species that had either lost parasite resistance or exhibited reduced replication ability. These findings demonstrate that co-evolution between host and parasitic replicators can result in diversity loss and frequent extinctions depending on dilution conditions, highlighting the critical role of environmental parameters, such as dilution frequency, in enabling primitive replicators to evolve sustainably toward the emergence of life.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Within this mechanism, the regulation of cytokinin biosynthesis by nitrate signaling via NIN-like protein 7 as well as the loading of tZ-type cytokinins into xylem by ATP-binding cassette transporter G14 have been well studied. However, the roles of other components remain unclear. Here, we show that cytokinin perception and degradation in roots, as mediated by Arabidopsis histidine kinase 3 (AHK3) and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase 4 (CKX4), modulate root-to-shoot transport of tZ-type cytokinins. Grafting experiments demonstrated that root-specific AHK3 deficiency systemically increased leaf blade area through long-distance signals of root-derived tZ-type cytokinin, perceived by shoot-expressed AHK3. Transcriptome, hormonome, and reporter analyses revealed that root-specific AHK3 deficiency reduced CKX4 expression in roots, elevating tZ-type cytokinin levels in roots and xylem sap and thereby enhancing leaf cytokinin response. Transfer experiments manipulating root nitrate levels showed that root-specific AHK3 deficiency promoted leaf blade area in a manner dependent on both nitrate and root-derived tZ-type cytokinin signaling. Moreover, both nitrate signals and root-expressed AHK3 are required for maximal CKX4 induction in roots, and root-specific CKX4 deficiency enhanced leaf blade area in a nitrate-dependent manner.

We report the widespread presence of 6mA across 17 isolates of nematodes, along with an exploration of the 6mA landscape in the genomes of six notorious agricultural pathogen root-knot nematodes (RKNs). Our results indicate that 6mA has a conserved \"GAG\" motif in different nematodes but exhibits different distribution patterns and effects on gene expression. The distribution of 6mA in transposable elements differs between polyploid and diploid nematodes, suggesting lineage-specific epigenetic regulation potentially associated with polyploidy. Importantly, we identified two potential 6mA demethylases, MiNMAD-1 and MiNMAD-2, and confirmed their catalytic activity and site. Subsequent host-induced gene silencing of minmad-1 resulted in a significant increase in plant resistance to three polyploid RKNs species. A detailed functional characterization revealed that knocking down minmad-1 impaired the expression patterns of various virulence genes in the parasitic stage, thereby decreasing the virulence of RKNs on hosts. Our findings suggest that 6mA demethylase may serve as an epigenetic marker linked to pathogen virulence, enhancing our understanding of RKN biology and providing novel resources for the development of RKN prevention and control strategies.\n\nSignificance Statement6mA methyltransferase regulates the expression of virulence genes in certain pathogenic bacteria and plays a critical role in their infectivity. However, the regulation of virulence gene expression in eukaryotic pathogens, particularly plant pathogens, remains largely unexplored. Most studies on pathogen virulence have focused on the function of individual effectors, with limited research on the global regulation of virulence gene expression. Through an epigenetic study of plant-parasitic nematodes, we found that 6mA globally regulates the expression patterns of virulence genes in RKNs. Furthermore, we generated transgenic tobacco, tomato, and rice plants expressing dsRNA targeting the nematode demethylase and found that these transgenic plants exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to RKNs.

M.; Boonekamp, J.", "abstract": "Markers of oxidative stress are widely used as biomarkers of health, ageing, and physiological stress. However, their reliability as biomarkers remains uncertain due to high intraindividual variation, obscuring associations with environmental conditions, lifestyle, frailty, and physiological indicators of health such as telomere length. Whilst numerous longitudinal studies exist, the individual repeatability of oxidative stress measurements is rarely reported. This study presents the first meta-analysis assessing individual repeatability of oxidative stress markers, comprising 123 repeatability estimates obtained from 22 studies. We found that oxidative stress exhibits low individual repeatability (Intraclass correlation = 0.164), regardless of oxidative stress marker type, taxa, sex, study design, or environment. This flags serious limitations regarding the utility of oxidative stress measurements to meaningfully capture aspects of health and to predict other health-related traits such as telomere length. In line with this assertion, we found that different markers of oxidative stress were often poorly correlated. Next, we simulated causal effects of oxidative stress on telomere length to reveal statistical power limitations on the detection of a relationship between oxidative stress and telomere length when the individual repeatability of oxidative stress is consistent with our meta-analysis findings. Our simulations reveal that substantially larger samples sizes are required than those typically used in this field. On a more positive note, we also show that increasing the number of repeated samples can improve statistical power. This would create valuable opportunities for untangling the causes of intraindividual variation in oxidative stress, improving the utility of oxidative stress as biomarkers of environmental effects on fitness, as well as elucidating the functional consequences of oxidative stress for health and ageing.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Molecular dynamics simulations are, in theory, well-equipped to efficiently investigate these mechanisms. However, the massive size of fully assembled viral capsids---the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome---demands computational resources well beyond the requirements of conventional simulations.

While laboratory studies have provided important insights into the spontaneous mutation spectrum, laboratory environments for optimal growth may engender biases that are not representative of natural populations. We analyzed the mitochondrial genomes of 1,524 Caenorhabditis elegans natural isolates comprising 550 unique haplotypes to investigate mtDNA polymorphism in the wild. Ancestral reconstruction was used to polarize 2,464 variants (88 indels, 2,376 SNPs) and the results were compared to mutations identified in experimental lines under relaxed selection. MtDNA variant distribution in natural isolates is strongly dependent on site-degeneracy in a manner consistent with purifying selection. There is significant variation in the synonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphism between genes. Specifically, ETC complex I genes are enriched for nonsynonymous polymorphism. The probability of synonymous mutation is higher at sites with flanking G/C nucleotides and the per gene synonymous polymorphism is negatively correlated with A+T-content at the 1st and 2nd codon positions. Furthermore, the 5' and 3' ends of genes have both higher A+T-content and less synonymous polymorphism than central regions. There is evidence of natural selection for preferred codons. We identify the first cases of large heteroplasmic mtDNA structural variants in C. elegans natural isolates, comprising deletions and duplications. Although some patterns of mtDNA mutational bias are similar between laboratory and natural populations, there exist significant differences. In particular, transversions typically associated with oxidative damage are less common at four-fold degenerate sites in natural populations relative to the laboratory.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Existing machine learning (ML) models are limited by their dependence on structural input, inadequate training data, and lack of rigorous methods for handling heterogeneous experimental labels. To address these challenges, we developed AiPP, an AI protein profiling platform that predicts ligand-binding residues directly from protein sequence, including covalent and reversible ligand-binding sites, and disordered molecular recognition motifs that fold upon binding. AiPP is powered by protein large language models (pLLMs) and two newly curated comprehensive databases, LigCys-ABPP (cysteine-directed covalent liganding events quantified by ABPP) and LigBind3D (reversible binding sites in co-crystal structures). LigCysABPP comprises >700,000 cysteine-site records from 15 ABPP studies covering >10,000 human proteins. We developed a pLLM representation-based cluster-framework followed by consensus analysis to reconcile and augment heterogeneous experimental annotations. Two complementary iterative data expansion protocols were implemented to enhance model performance and generalization. AiPP recovers 80% (Top-1) of all cysteine liganding events from the Protein Data Bank with 78% precision and AUPRC of 84%.

High glucose induces morphological deterioration of organoids featuring podocyte and tubular cell detachment without cytotoxicity. Cytokine addition sensitizes organoids to intermediate concentrations of elevated glucose. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that high glucose levels affect cytokine, inflammation, signaling, and cell adhesion pathways, resembling changes in human diabetic kidneys. Inhibitors of cytokines and signaling pathways rescue the high glucose phenotype, which is independent of osmotic effects.

Although our task employed only a single external degree of freedom, neural dynamics reflected transitions amongst many dimensions and multiple distinct computations. Different behavioral control strategies were associated with distinct neural locations and dimensions, sometimes used compositionally.

However, controversy exists as to whether this imbalance is a direct causal mechanism for autism, or a compensatory response to other primary etiological factors. Using chemogenetic manipulations in neonatal mice, we show that a transient E:I imbalance during development is sufficient to permanently reprogram autism-relevant social brain circuits. Chemogenetically manipulated mice exhibit lifelong impairments in sociability, persistent dysregulation of multiple autism-risk synaptic genes, and sustained cortical hyperexcitability in adulthood. Importantly, these social impairments are robustly rescued by pharmacological inhibition of neuronal excitability. Developmental E:I imbalance also disrupts functional connectivity in social brain regions enriched for transcriptionally dysregulated genes, suggesting a convergence of transcriptional and circuit-level pathology. Finally, multivariate modelling shows that behavioral dysfunction in chemogenetically manipulated animals closely associates with disrupted connectivity between prefrontal and mesolimbic dopaminergic regions. Collectively, our findings reconcile conflicting theories in the field and point to activity-dependent transcriptional remodeling as a foundational mechanism by which transient E:I imbalance during development can cause lasting, autism-relevant circuit dysfunction.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

However, whether UPR signaling regulates hematopoietic lineage fate decision remains elusive. Here, we found that Fc{gamma}R- MPP3 generates erythroid lineage and Jak2V617F mutation leads to overproduction of erythroid cells by expanding Fc{gamma}R- MPP3. We showed that UPR signaling increases myeloid cell production through promoting Fc{gamma}R- MPP3 transition to granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) producing Fc{gamma}R+ MPP3. Under a disease condition, UPR signaling cooperates with Jak2V617F mutation and exacerbates disease phenotype as increasing red blood cells in a mouse model of polycythemia vera (PV). Activation of UPR signaling also increased myeloid output in healthy donor bone marrow MPP cells while skewing the output towards erythroid lineage in PV patient bone marrow MPP cells.

Many seabirds exhibit delayed plumage maturation, in which young birds spend years in visually distinct predefinitive plumages before attaining the definitive plumage of adults. Previous work hypothesized that predefinitive plumages may function to reduce aggression towards young, predefinitive seabirds at breeding colonies, an idea known from other lineages of birds as the status signaling hypothesis. We tested this hypothesis with visual stimulus experiments at a breeding colony of American Herring Gulls (Larus smithsonianus). We presented painted models of four different plumage classes (first-cycle predefinitive gull plumage, third-cycle predefinitive gull plumage, definitive gull plumage, and a Canada Goose as a control) and measured the aggressive responses of breeding adults at their nests. Breeding gulls responded with significantly less frequent, lower, and slower aggression toward the first-cycle and control plumages compared to the definitive plumage. There were no significant differences in response towards the third-cycle plumage. These results offer support for a status signaling hypothesis, indicating that substantial, mottled brown plumage --as worn by first-cycle gulls -- reduces aggression from breeding adults in colonies or foraging flocks. Future research can investigate how immature seabirds -- including third-cycle gulls -- may combine plumage, posture, and behavior to shift the dynamics of social behavior at breeding colonies.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Healthy protein homeostasis ('proteostasis') relies on tightly-regulated protein quality-control (PQC) circuits that co-ordinate sequestration and clearance of potentially toxic aggregation-prone proteins, arising from various internal or external stress throughout an organism's lifespan. At the protein level, proteotoxic stress responses typically involve extensive poly-ubiquitylation and sequestration of aggregation-prone proteins and PQC factors into various protective cytoplasmic and nuclear granules. However, much of our current understanding regarding this aspect of stress responses in humans stems from research in proliferating cells--despite growing evidence that stress responses vary considerably at the transcriptional level across cell proliferation states. Here, we show that the senescent cellular state--considered a major contributor to ageing-associated degeneration due to a chronic inflammatory phenotype--re-wires PQC and expels the misfolded protein load to mitigate proteotoxic stresses. Starting with a multi-dimensional transcriptomics and proteomics approach for measuring levels of total, poly-ubiquitylated, and granule-forming proteins, we have discovered a clear point of divergence between senescent and proliferating or quiescent human cell states in their responses to proteotoxic stress. Although the proteins that were poly-ubiquitylated and degraded during stress were largely conserved across states, the stress-induced sedimentation of a large number of disease-associated RNA-binding proteins (including TDP-43) was impaired only in the senescent state. Strikingly, TDP-43, as well as several other misfolded proteins, were actively secreted through the endo-lysosomal system by a diverse range of senescent cells during acute or chronic stress, through a process that requires the vesicle-associated HSP70 co-chaperone DNAJC5--an established risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases. Misfolded protein secretion could be rescued by increasing intracellular HSP levels in 'shallow' but not 'deep' senescence, suggesting that secretion is a proteostatic adaptation that becomes less reversible over time. Our findings reveal an unappreciated aspect of the senescent-cell secretory phenotype, which may have important consequences for the non-cell-autonomous impact of senescence at the level of tissue resilience and frailty.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Although global knockout of the mouse Ehmt2 gene results in early embryonic lethality, tissue-specific knockouts have uncovered diverse roles in organ development. However, how EHMT2 contributes to skeletal development in a lineage-specific manner remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of EHMT2 in skeletal development by conditionally inactivating Ehmt2 in neural crest-derived and mesoderm-derived progenitors using Wnt1-Cre and Prx1-Cre mouse lines, respectively. Loss of Ehmt2 function in neural crest cells led to postnatal growth failure and craniofacial defects, including delayed intramembranous ossification and malformations of the jaw and cranial base. Transcriptomic analysis of neural crest cells revealed disrupted chromatin regulatory networks, reduced expression of proliferation-associated genes, and upregulation of inflammatory pathways. In contrast, inactivation of Ehmt2 in Prx1-expressing mesodermal progenitors had minimal impact on limb and cranial bone development, with no significant alterations in bone mass or osteoblast function.

Cells that originate from one niche possess distinct mechanosensitive adaptations that influence their response to their new niche, a concept known as mechanical memory. However, the mechanisms by which this memory is acquired, and the degree to which it influences migratory potential and decision-making processes in confinement remain poorly understood. Here, we combine stiffness priming using polyacrylamide hydrogels with a confinement platform to screen mechanical memory across healthy and transformed cells.

Bulk RNA sequencing identifies NFATC2 as a transcription factor that mediates mechanical memory by reprogramming gene expression in stiffness-sensitive cells. siRNA-induced knockdown of NFATC2 in memory-sensitive cells confirmed its necessity for mechanical memory acquisition and subsequent confined migration enhancement.

This is despite evidence that differentiation with optimized concentrations of BMP4, Activin A, and bFGF offers finer control of cardiomyocyte phenotype. Here, we develop scalable hPSC expansion and growth factor-based cardiac differentiation protocols using the vertical wheel bioreactor (VWBR) system. Methods and Results: The expansion of undifferentiated hPSCs was first optimized in 100 mL VWBRs by varying parameters, including starting cell seeding density, agitation rate, and media exchange schedule. Proliferation, viability, aggregate diameter, media metabolites, and pluripotency were assessed during hPSC expansion. Next, we evaluated the effects of undifferentiated hPSC culture conditions on subsequent cardiomyocyte differentiation potential. We found that hPSCs expanded in static culture or in VWBRs at different densities and agitation rates all differentiated into hPSC-CM populations of similar cardiac purity; however, cardiomyocyte yields were initially lower when VWBR-expanded hPSCs were used. We compared the differentiation kinetics of hPSCs expanded in VWBRs to conventional 2D culture and found that the former had accelerated mesodermal commitment and significantly greater cKit+/CXCR4+/PDGRF- cell formation during differentiation. Modifying our aggregation and mesoderm induction steps improved cell yields and enabled reliable production of >1x106 cells/mL cardiac troponin T+ (cTnT) hPSC-CMs. Highlighting the versatility of our growth factor-based system, variation in the BMP4:Activin A ratio enabled a second heart field-like differentiation and generation of atrial-like cardiomyocytes in VWBRs. We further show that our expansion and differentiation protocols are reproducible and economical in 500 mL VWBRs, yielding on average 1.11x106 hPSC-CMs/mL at a mean purity of 93% cTnT+. Characterization of VWBR produced hPSC-CM force generation, action potentials, and intercellular calcium transients confirmed the expected phenotype of ventricular-like cells. Lastly, VWBR produced hPSC-CMs robustly engrafted in the infarcted guinea pig myocardium, supporting use as a cell therapy product.

During chronological aging, acidification of the culture media due accumulation of acetic acid is one of the major cell-extrinsic factors contributing to age-related cell death. Thus, buffering media pH to prevent acidification significantly extends longevity. Here, we found that cells expressing pathogenic polyQ expansion proteins display increased sensitivity to acetic acid and shortened CLS. Buffering media pH promotes both polyQ aggregation into IBs and promotes longevity. We also found that growth at alkaline pH induces the activation of heat shock response (HSR) in young cells. Such hormetic HSR activation subsequently allowed aged cells to mount a proper HSR in response to stresses such as heat shock or polyQ misfolding, leading to lifespan extension.

Distortion-evoked responses show ~10-times greater sensitivity and 45% higher temporal precision than those of same-frequency primary tones. Moreover, self-sustained oscillations of the male's ear dramatically reshape auditory frequency tuning and neuronal recruitment.

Despite significant literature examining sanitizer impact on bacterial pathogens during chilling, the mechanisms of sanitizer efficacy in terms of pathogen and organic load, sanitizer levels, and exposure duration are not well understood. To assess these, we report on experimentally-informed-mechanistic-modeling to describe pathogen dynamics during poultry chilling. The shedding and survival of a five-strain cocktail of poultry-plant derived Salmonella enterica serovars, at high and low loads, with exposure to peracetic acid (PAA; 0 to 200 mg/L) for up to 60 min in 10 L chiller tanks, in the presence or absence of whole chicken carcass/parts, were measured. Process water parameters versus time were simultaneously monitored. Results suggest that total dissolved solids (TDS) predict PAA decay more consistently than chemical oxygen demand (COD). A mathematical model for PAA decay and pathogen shedding/inactivation was developed. This model accurately predicted PAA level changes in the pre/main chiller of a high-speed poultry processing plant in North America. Without PAA, Salmonella shedding from chicken thighs is influenced by rinse time and number of rinses. Without organic load, residual PAA (1 mg/L) inactivated bacteria given sufficient exposure time, although PAA levels > 5 mg/L were essential for rapid inactivation. With organic load, initial PAA concentration (> 40 mg/L) and exposure time (> 2 min) were critical for bacterial inactivation, with model results connecting process conditions to dominate modes of bacterial inactivation on chicken.

In 2023, we deployed 4,012 autonomous recording units across 1,009 randomly selected 5-km2 hexagons, generating nearly 2.2 million hours of recordings, representing approximately 1 petabyte of acoustic data. These data were processed with PNW-Cnet v5, the latest version of our convolutional neural network model, trained on 135 sound classes representing over 80 species and environmental sounds. Model performance demonstrated high precision for focal species and many additional taxa, substantially reducing manual review effort while enabling broad-scale biodiversity assessments. Results confirmed northern spotted owl detections in all 20% sample areas, with occupancy varying geographically and declining notably in the Tyee study area. Barred owls were widely detected, with the highest prevalence in Oregon and Washington and comparatively lower occupancy in California. Marbled murrelets were consistently detected in coastal areas, particularly the Olympic Peninsula and Oregon Coast Range. Beyond these focal species, PAM and PNW-Cnet generated robust datasets for a wide range of birds, mammals, and disturbance indicators, underscoring the value of random-site, multi-species monitoring. The 2023 field season marked the first full implementation of the 2% + 20% NWFP sampling design, expanding monitoring coverage while strengthening collaborations with federal and state partners. These efforts provide the foundation for long-term, cost-effective wildlife monitoring and inform conservation strategies in dynamic forest ecosystems.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Under abnormal deregulation conditions, these elements can be expressed and contribute to the development of diseases, such as gastric cancer. This malignancy may be associated with infections, including those caused by Helicobacter pylori. However, the scientific literature does not yet provide clear evidence regarding the relationship between HERVs and H. pylori in the context of gastric cancer. Thus, HERVs may represent potential biomarkers for this neoplasm, as well as possible therapeutic targets. This study aimed to characterize HERV expression in gastric cancer using next-generation sequencing (NGS). We analyzed 46 tumor tissue samples and 42 peritumoral tissue samples from patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma, collected at HUJBB and Ophir Loyola hospitals. Among the tumor samples, 38 tested positive for H. pylori infection. For library preparation, 1g of total RNA per sample was used, with integrity assessed via TapeStation (~260 bp band). cDNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform (paired-end), following the ID Output V2 kit protocol. Alignment was performed with STAR software, and HERVs were identified and quantified using Telescope. Differential expression analysis of HERVs was performed on transcript data using DESeq2. A total of 183 HERVs were found to be differentially expressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent tissues. In tumor samples associated with H. pylori infection, 44 HERVs showed differential expression. Overall, tumor tissues exhibited higher HERV transcription compared to adjacent tissues.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

This virus strategically exploits inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-{kappa}B, and modulates key enzymes like COX-2, promoting chronic inflammation and cellular alterations that significantly elevate the risk of carcinogenesis. A precise and comprehensive understanding of these pathways, combined with insights from advanced studies, is imperative for developing effective strategies to manage inflammation and mitigate the adverse impacts of HPV on cellular health. This study follows our previous research, which established HPV genotyping and related analyses, providing a foundation for the current investigation. It confirms a strong association between high-risk HPV genotypes and significant cytological and inflammatory alterations. Among individuals infected with high-risk HPV (16, 18, 52), 90% exhibited notable cellular changes and severe inflammatory responses, compared to 45.5% in low-risk HPV cases and 59.3% in samples containing other HPV genotypes. In the 20-30-year age group, 100% of samples displayed endocervical/metaplastic cells, with 70% exhibiting substantial cytological abnormalities, highlighting an increased susceptibility of younger individuals to HPV-induced epithelial disruptions. These findings emphasize the critical role of NF-{kappa}B and AhR pathways in modulating cellular responses, providing a foundation for targeted therapeutic interventions. Regulating NF-{kappa}B activity and microbiota-driven AhR modulation emerge as promising therapeutic strategies for mitigating inflammation and cellular damage associated with HPV infections. By integrating cytological observations with molecular analyses, this study presents a comprehensive perspective on HPV-induced pathophysiology, reinforcing the necessity for precision-based therapeutic approaches to effectively manage HPV-driven cellular and inflammatory alterations.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Previous genome-centric surveys have cataloged hundreds of uncharacterized BGCs in the oral cavity associated with health and disease, but these studies relied on reference genomes and did not capture strain-level variation or the native distribution of BGCs. Here, we assembled three independently sourced metagenomic datasets from healthy and dental caries samples, extracted BGCs, and quantified their abundance alongside expression in a metatranscriptomic dataset. We first identified that aryl polyene, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP), and nonribosomal peptide (NRP) encoding BGCs were the most abundant BGC classes across all three metagenomic datasets. We then grouped these BGCs into homology-based families and found that homologous clusters were usually consistently associated with either health or dental caries, suggesting conserved community-level roles for BGCs. An elastic-net regression model further selected 45 BGCs out of >5000 that could distinguish healthy and dental caries samples in the metatranscriptomic dataset, which demonstrated that BGCs could be predictive markers of disease. This analysis emphasizes the importance of high-quality metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets to resolve BGC expression patterns and to guide discovery of metabolites relevant to oral health and disease.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Recent data suggest that ablating cardiac afferent neurons in rats attenuates left ventricular (LV) remodeling following MI by blocking this overactivation. Our lab has shown that acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are highly expressed in cardiac afferents and may sense myocardial acidosis. We hypothesized that genetic deletion of ASICs might abrogate disadvantageous remodeling after MI by disrupting afferent signaling pathways otherwise resulting in overactivation of neurohormonal responses. To test this hypothesis, we induced MI by coronary artery ligation in wild type (WT) and ASIC3-/- mice and assessed cardiac remodeling by serial echocardiography. We found that ASIC3-/- mice had less LV dilation relative to MI size, increased LV mass, and increased stroke volume compared to WT mice after MI. To investigate a potential role of the autonomic nervous system, we measured renal and splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity, heart rate and systolic blood pressure variability (sBPV), and hemodynamic responses to atropine and propranolol. In addition, we assessed baroreceptor-heart rate and baroreceptor-renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) reflex function. Following MI, ASIC3-/- mice had lower baroreceptor-RSNA reflex sensitivity than WT mice, associated with elevated sBPV. Importantly, sBPV correlated significantly with post-MI changes in LV mass in ASIC3-/- but not WT mice. Our data shows that ASIC3 plays an important role in cardiac remodeling after MI potentially via modulation of baroreflex sensitivity and sBPV. ASIC3 may be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target in heart failure.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

In the gene regulation field, recent data have shown that higher transcription factor (TF) concentrations may increase transcription levels of a gene without affecting the gene activation time. We call this behaviour output decoupling. Motivated by these observations, here we investigate mechanisms for output decoupling in Markov process models where a readout molecule is produced downstream of ligand binding. Our focus is on identifying regimes where the steady-state level of the readout changes with input concentration, while the activation time, quantified by mean first-passage times, remains unaffected. Through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, we find two mechanisms through which output decoupling can arise: i) rate scale separation, where the system is comprised of slow and fast transitions that are differentially regulated by the input; and ii) incoherent regulation, where the input acts on two transitions with opposing effects on readout production, with all transitions operating on similar timescales in the absence of input. Such incoherent regulation has emerged as a plausible regulatory mode of TFs, and we suggest decoupling as a new characteristic feature of this regulatory mode. More broadly, our findings offer a mechanistic and conceptual framework for reasoning about output decoupling in input-output systems.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Prioritized processing of ones own name plays a key role in attention, self-awareness, and social and cognitive development. Previous studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have reported a self-preferential effect for the own name, characterized by enhanced neural responses compared to the names of (close) others. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate an EEG auditory frequency-tagging task to measure self-preferential processing of the own name, leveraging the superior signal-to-noise ratio of this technique, which is highly relevant for future studies on infants and clinical populations. To this end, we ran two separate studies (dichotic: n1 = 31, non-dichotic: n2 = 32). In contrast to previous ERP research, we did not find evidence of a self-preferential effect. We reasoned that collapsing temporal information may have led to the failure to capture the effect, which ERP research has shown to emerge at a late stage of processing, and that this effect may have been overshadowed by early brain responses. To address this issue, we applied a novel approach that we refer to as the time-resolved frequency tagging approach, which incorporates knowledge of the effect in the temporal domain. This did result in a clear self-preferential effect of the own name. Hence, we were able to develop and validate an EEG frequency-tagging task to measure the self-preferential effect of the own name.

Here, we combined high-density EEG with a serial awakening paradigm during NREM sleep to examine its neural and experiential correlates. As expected, deeper sleep was associated with reduced cortical activation, reflected in a lower high-to-low frequency power ratio. Yet, this relationship weakened in the presence of dreaming, indicating that immersive conscious experiences can counteract the impact of cortical activation on perceived depth. Indeed, perceived sleep depth was lowest during states with a mere sense of presence and highest during immersive dreaming or deep unconsciousness. Across the night, physiological sleep pressure and subjective sleepiness declined, but perceived sleep depth rose alongside increasing dream immersiveness. These results challenge the view that deep sleep stems solely from reduced brain activity and suggest that immersive dreaming sustains perceived sleep depth as homeostatic pressure wanes.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Increasing use of 3D environments and multimodal recordings adds challenges for development, accessibility, and reproducibility. Fragmented tools often separate presentation, synchronization, and logging, leading to inefficiencies. New Method: The Neuroscience Experimental Runtime by Vanderbilt (NERV) is a Unity-based framework that unifies experiment design, execution, and data logging. It enables rapid, no-code prototyping by automating scene and script generation, event timing, state management, hardware-synchronized data acquisition, and archival of code and experimental configurations. The modular, open-source framework implements a \"low floor, high ceiling\" design that lowers barriers for non-programmers while remaining extensible for advanced customization. Results: Across 500 trials, Unity-to-TTL delay was 2.10 +/- 1.21 ms, TTL-to-photodiode delay was 28.93 +/- 0.76 ms, and Unity-to-screen delay was 31.04 +/- 1.41 ms. These results confirm stable millisecond precision and frame-locked timing, enabling reliable alignment of neural, behavioral, and visual events. Comparison with existing methods: Existing frameworks involve trade-offs. Some achieve precise timing but require advanced coding, while others improve accessibility but struggle with hardware or 3D graphics. Commercial platforms offer polish yet remain costly, closed-source, and inflexible. NERV combines millisecond precision, modular open-source design, and provenance in a single platform, reducing workflow fragmentation and enabling reproducible, scalable experiments. Conclusion: NERV is an accessible yet extensible framework that unites rapid development, robust data provenance, and millisecond precision. It accelerates development, ensures reproducibility, and establishes a scalable foundation for next-generation neuroscience research.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

For Multiple Sclerosis (MS), there is a similar unmet medical need regarding tauopathy when MS transitions into the late, or Progressive MS that is currently incurable. AD and MS share commonality: there is comorbidity between AD and MS [2], and the recent awareness that progressive MS may be considered a secondary tauopathy [3]. This study lays the basic science foundation for a future repurposing of ASO tauopathy therapy from AD to MS. The central hypothesis is that in Progressive MS, tauopathy is not a passive bystander but an active contributor to synaptic degeneration through a novel toxic target known as DSI (Dendritic Syntaphilin Intrusion) discovered in our laboratory. In this hypothesis, the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2B activates Tau hyperphosphorylation (p-Tau), leading to the mislocalization or intrusion of a mitochondrial anchor SNPH into neuronal dendrites (DSI). This causes mitochondrial damage and subsequent synapse/dendrite disintegration. In support of this hypothesis that tauopathy is a key driver of DSI, we demonstrated using primary neuronal cultures that inhibitors of p-Tau kinases and Tau-KO both completely abolish DSI. We propose that a therapy for Progressive MS is repurpose the existing FDA-approved ASO Tau knockdown therapy from AD to treat MS.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

By assessing the statistical burden of variations, we demonstrated that these features effectively discriminate among diverse variant classes and reveal a consistent enrichment of functional sites, structural integrity, and biophysical changes in pathogenic and driver mutations. Building on these insights, we developed MutaPheno, an interpretable framework for predicting the functional consequences of missense mutations. The model integrates 34 molecular-level features, encompassing structural, functional, physicochemical, and contextual descriptors, using a random forest algorithm. Trained exclusively on pathogenic and benign variants, MutaPheno achieved strong accuracy in predicting cancer driver mutations, outperforming both cancer-specific and general pathogenicity tools, while also demonstrating superior robustness when tested on unseen proteins.

Simultaneously, many bioinformatics tasks demand a unified signal source that encapsulates this information, rather than requiring researchers to input each omics feature individually. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework for the integrated representation of DNA sequences and their associated omics data. Central to our approach is a large-scale, batch-structured omics dataset optimized for deep learning at scale.

To this end, we developed Spatial Component Decomposition (SCD), a sparse dictionary learning framework that locates sources of spatial influence without relying on prior assumptions from systems neuroscience. Applied to MRI data capturing retinotopic maps, SCD reveals a dominant linear gradient extending over 60 mm from V1 and covering all the known posterior visual areas.

Urban areas, as landscapes under particularly strong anthropogenic influence, are undergoing rapid ecological change, yet the consequences for urban biodiversity and ecosystem functioning remain poorly understood. In this study, we focused on fruit flies of the genus Drosophila - a diverse group of dipterans with variable ecological niches and degrees of synanthropy - to investigate species composition and community ecology in the metropolitan area of Vienna, Austria. With the help of numerous citizen scientists, we have collected approximately 18,000 specimens through dense spatio-temporal sampling both indoors and outdoors of human dwellings. A total of 13 Drosophila species were identified, with communities dominated by widespread cosmopolitan synanthropic species. Among these, D. mercatorum and D. virilis represent novel records for Austria. Comparisons to a previous study from more than 30 years ago revealed that the species richness in Vienna was more than 50% lower than before and showed that formerly common species were potentially replaced by neobiots. We further assessed ecological niches by intersecting species abundance data with high-dimensional, high-resolution earth observation datasets, which revealed distinct ecological preferences among species. In particular, the neozoan D. mercatorum emerged as a highly synanthropic species, tightly confined to urban areas with high levels of imperviousness. In summary, our study underpins the versatility of the Drosophila system as indicators of biodiversity loss in a rapidly changing world.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Here we analyze vertebrate eDNA in New York Citys East River, a rocky estuary channel difficult to survey with mechanical gear and subject to wastewater discharge. We collected water samples weekly for one year and applied spike-in metabarcoding to quantify vertebrate eDNA. Replication experiments demonstrated good reproducibility above about 10 eDNA copies/PCR. We propose a fish censusing scale based on absolute eDNA abundance. Local marine fish eDNA followed a classic hollow curve species abundance distribution over four orders of magnitude, with abundant and common taxa comprising about 25% of species and 95% of fish eDNA. There was a 10-fold increase in local marine fish eDNA in summer and seasonal differences among taxa consistent with known phenology. Two fish species were newly abundant in comparison to an eDNA survey at the same site in 2016. Levels of other vertebrate eDNA--domesticated animal, non-fish wildlife, and dietary fish--were correlated with human eDNA levels, consistent with a shared wastewater source. Wastewater eDNA identified the commonest urban mammals, land birds, and household pets. Proportions of dietary animal eDNA in wastewater closely approximated proportions in national consumption statistics, opening a window into human diet assessment. Effort and cost for the weekly shoreline survey were modest. Vertebrate eDNA metabarcoding with spike-in quantification enabled weekly monitoring of urban estuary fish populations, identified overlooked newly abundant species, and reported on terrestrial wildlife and human diet.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Alien plants have generally been shown to support reduced arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity, but inferences have typically come from studies limited in taxonomic and geographic scope. Here, we make use of data from a unique citizen science project, Caterpillars Count!, that consists of nearly 70,000 standardized surveys of woody plant branches across eastern North America on over 100 plant species. From these data we find that caterpillar (i.e. larval Lepidoptera) occurrence was nearly 4 times higher, beetle (order Coleoptera) occurrence was 50% higher, and spider (order Araneae) occurrence was 17% higher on native versus alien plants. The occurrence of hoppers and allies (suborder Auchenorrhyncha) was slightly higher on alien plants, while there was little difference in occurrence on native versus alien plants for ants (family Formicidae) or true bugs (suborder Heteroptera). Species richness of caterpillars, spiders, and beetles was also higher on average on native versus alien plants. The increased occurrence of caterpillars on native plants was consistent across plant families, whereas differences between native and alien plants for the other arthropod groups were highly variable across plant families. Caterpillar occurrence varied widely both within and between plant families, suggesting the importance of other plant species characteristics beyond native versus alien origin. Finally, we show that caterpillar occurrence appears to increase with latitude on alien plants at a faster rate than it does on native plants, but that this difference can be attributed to shifts in the identity and composition of plant species across the latitudinal gradient within our dataset. These findings have implications for how the increased spread of alien plants may impact ecosystems and food webs, and for land managers seeking to mitigate those changes.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

These mountains harbor a wide variety of native small mammals spanning 11 families of bats, rodents and shrews. Improved understanding of Madrean Sky Island biodiversity will potentially advance studies of biogeography, phylogenetic relationships, host-symbiont interactions, and processes of community assembly in this ecoregion. However, which species are found in each sky island and how their populations are genetically related remain open questions. To establish the current knowledge baseline, we used voucher specimen geocoordinates and elevations to summarize the extent and timing of past collecting efforts for small mammals in woodland habitats across the Madrean Sky Islands. In total, 97 species of small mammals (39 bats, 54 rodents, 4 shrews) from 9,541 specimens were collected from 1884 to 2023. Of these historical specimens, 79% come from five sky islands (Chiricahuas, Pinalenos, Huachucas, Animas, and Santa Catalinas) and only 25 sky islands in the Madrean system have any recorded specimens. Mexico's 25 sky islands are mostly unsampled (only the San Luis, Sierra dos Ajos, and Sierra La Mariquita have any specimens) and several of Arizona's larger sky islands have fewer than 40 specimens (Galiuros, Canelo Hills, Santa Teresas, Mules, and Dragoons). A large majority of small mammal specimens (87%) were collected prior to 1980, meaning they were collected without DNA/RNA preservation as a priority. This distributional summary is the current basis for all derived biodiversity knowledge of Madrean Sky Island small mammals, illustrating clear gaps regarding most species of woodland-dwelling bats, rodents, and shrews. This work lays the foundation for future fieldwork and voucher specimen preservation in the Madrean Sky Islands, especially from undersampled mountains where biodiversity assumptions are unconfirmed.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Species richness remains a widespread metric in long-term monitoring, yet it obscures underlying processes since changes in species richness are often only the result of turnover, homogenisation and/or shifts in relative abundances. Furthermore, biodiversity trends and their drivers can vary across spatial scales, demanding spatially explicit approaches. This study aims at unraveling how changes in community structure shape trends in richness across spatial scales, offering a more mechanistic view on biodiversity trend detection. Location: Europe Time period: 1975 - 2023 Major taxa studied: Birds Methods: We first assessed trends in breeding bird richness on local (site-level) and national scale for 25 European countries or sub-divisions using linear models. Next, we applied the multi-scale ''Measures of Biodiversity'' (MoB) framework in a temporal context to decompose changes in species richness into contributions from individual density, species-abundance distribution, and con-specific spatial aggregation. We then quantify how these components drive species richness from local plots to national extents. Analyses were further conducted separately for farmland and forest guilds, as well as across ecoregions. Results: Three general patterns emerged beyond variation among countries and functional guilds: Aggregation dominates local richness dynamics, evenness governs broad-scale trends, and density plays an intermediate role. Findings of distinct local and national trends in bird richness agree with previous findings, albeit we find more heterogeneous average trends among countries on local scales. Distinct trends and component's patterns vary among ecoregions within countries, highlighting the need for sub-national analyses. Main conclusions: This scale-explicit, component-based approach reveals how changes in community structure shape trends in species richness from local to national scales. Such mechanistic insights of biodiversity change might enable more precisely targeted conservation strategies and identification of external drivers.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

On the other hand, little is known about the relative importance of trait-mediated indirect effects of environmental stressors on population dynamics. How does an environmental stressor indirectly affect the population dynamics of a focal species by altering the traits of interacting species and the strength of interspecific interactions? Here, we quantified the direct and trait-mediated indirect effects of an environmental stressor by combining rotifer-alga experiments and Bayesian parameter estimation of a dynamic model. These days, human activities salinize freshwater lakes globally, thereby increasing (decreasing) the death (birth) rates of plankton species. Salinity stress is also known to induce clump formation in certain phytoplankton species. As larger clumps work as a defense trait against gape-limited predation of zooplankton, the salinity stress can affect zooplankton not only directly but also indirectly through phytoplankton trait changes. We first show that a green alga Chlamydomonas sphaeroides formed larger clumps than the two model species of green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris) under a moderate salinity stress (0.06M NaCl). Then, by tracking the clump size distributions of Chlamydomonas sphaeroides, we confirmed that small clumps are more vulnerable to predation by rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus as previous studies demonstrated. Finally, we co-cultured the green algae and rotifers for a week with and without salinity stress and fitted the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. We first estimated how salinity stress increased the mortality rate of rotifers by using Chlorella vulgaris, which seldom showed clump formation. Then, we estimated how salinity stress decreased the attack rate of rotifers on Chlamydomonas sphaeroides due to clump formation. We found that salinity stress increased the rotifer's mortality rate by 86% and decreased the attack rate on Chlamydomonas sphaeroides by 15%. These results indicate that salinity stress can weaken the predator-prey interaction, and thus salinization can harm freshwater zooplankton species through increasing the mortality rates and decreasing the attack rates. This will be an important step for a quantitative understanding of how environmental stressors can affect community dynamics via trait modifications.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Despite providing population-level benefits, endophyte prevalence declined eight-fold more in historically mutualistic populations that experienced high climate variability.

A.; Wuertz, S.", "abstract": "Understanding how microbial communities respond to disturbance remains a fundamental question in ecology, with broad implications for biodiversity, ecosystem function, and biotechnology. Trait-based approaches offer general rules to predict community responses by linking ecological strategies to measurable traits. While life-history strategy frameworks such as the competitor-ruderal-stress-tolerant (CSR) model are well established in plant and animal ecology, their application to microbial communities has been limited. Here, we experimentally tested how microbial communities shift across a gradient of disturbance frequency in replicated bioreactors treating synthetic wastewater. We applied six conditions by doubling the organic loading rate at different frequencies, from undisturbed to press disturbance, and monitored changes over 42 days using genome-resolved metagenomics, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, biomass quantification, and effluent chemistry. By integrating ordination, network analysis, and machine learning, we identified emergent community-level life-history strategies that aligned with increasing disturbance. These strategies were reflected in functional trade-offs, shifts in community composition, and genomic trait distributions. A simulation-based approach was used to generate a CSR classification of metagenome-assembled genomes, which was consistent with patterns observed in other microbial ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that life-history frameworks can capture predictable dynamics in microbial communities across disturbance regimes. This strategy provides a unifying tool for linking microbial structure, function, and traits across scales, helping to reconcile ecological theory with microbial resource management. More broadly, our findings support the integration of classical ecological theory with microbial genomics to uncover the trait-based principles that govern microbiome function and stability in both natural and engineered ecosystems.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

We studied the occurrence and relative abundances of the globally invasive fruit fly, Drosophila suzukii, and its recently introduced larval parasitoids, Leptopilina japonica and Ganaspis kimorum, across islands with varying sizes and levels of human-mediated transport in the Gulf and San Juan Islands of British Columbia (Canada) and Washington State (USA). Across two years and 58 sites, we collected D. suzukii and its parasitoids from wild blackberry, Rubus armeniacus, fruit. We predicted that parasitoids were more likely to be present on larger islands with higher levels of human activity and higher D. suzukii densities, and that the less specialized parasitoid species (L. japonica) would be more likely to establish on islands. We detected D. suzukii across all islands, indicating widespread establishment of this invasive pest.In contrast, we observed parasitoids on fewer than half of the islands. Leptopilina japonica was the only parasitoid of D. suzukii detected on islands. Parasitoid presence was marginally positively associated with island area and host density, but not average annual vehicle-ferry traffic (an indicator of human-mediated propagule pressure). Parasitism levels were low throughout the study region and we did not observe lower relative abundances of D. suzukii on islands where parasitoids were present -- in fact, the relative abundance of D. suzukii tended to be higher on islands where the parasitoid L. japonica was detected. These findings suggest that island characteristics, host density, and a consumer's host specificity may be associated with early establishment of introduced consumers on islands, but that a consumer's presence may not inevitably result in host population suppression, at least over the short term.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

In situations where individuals rely on signals from their mothers to inform them about selection, maternal trait responses to environmental factors that provide reliable cues may evolve to enable adaptation to selective but unreliable environments. We performed evolution experiments with the hermaphroditic nematode \\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} in a temporally uncorrelated anoxic selective environment, where, prior to reproduction, maternal generations received innocuous blue-light pulses that either reliably or unreliably cued their progeny for anoxia. After 60 non-overlapping generations of experimental evolution, populations that were reliably exposed to blue light during their history evolved plasticity in two maternal effect traits: one involved in the sensing of blue light and signal transduction to the germline, which was expressed only when grandmothers and mothers developed under anoxia; the other in oocyte deposition and embryo provisioning of essential energetic resources for survival in anoxia. We further found that reliably cued populations adapted to their temporally uncorrelated anoxic selective environment, while there was evidence of maladaptation in populations that were unreliably exposed to blue light, partly because they did not evolve maternal bet-hedging strategies of embryo resource provisioning. These findings demonstrate that environmental cue reliability can determine adaptive phenotypic plasticity in maternal traits.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

However, conventional DEG selection often relies on arbitrary thresholds for fold change and statistical significance, which are sensitive to experimental noise and sample size, thereby affecting reproducibility and biological interpretability. We present the Pathway Impact Score (PIS), a data-adaptive method that optimizes DEG thresholds by maximizing cumulative pathway enrichment. Unlike fixed cut-offs, PIS systematically determines dataset-specific thresholds that yield the most coherent and enriched pathways. Validation using the MAQC2 benchmark and 16 dataset of pulmonary fibrosis model suggested that PIS can improve the recovery of true DEGs, while maintaining stability under varying noise levels and replicate counts, and increasing pathway enrichment strength. PIS also supported high-resolution analysis of dose-dependent transcriptomic responses to phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, capturing pathway-level perturbations that appeared to align with the potency of each compound. Such analyses may facilitate more precise characterization of drug-induced transcriptional changes, highlighting the potential of PIS for integrative transcriptomic studies. Overall, PIS provides a practical, biologically informed framework for adaptive DEG selection, particularly suited for meta-analyses and integrative studies where dataset-specific variability needs careful consideration.

Therefore, innovative vector control strategies with alternative modes of action are urgently needed. Ivermectin (IVM), an endectocide, has demonstrated toxicity to mosquito species such as Anopheles and Aedes when they feed on treated humans or livestock. In this study, we conducted a laboratory experiment to assess the effect of IVM, at concentrations equivalent to human plasma levels following mass drug administration (MDA), on the survival and fecundity of Anopheles coluzzii and Aedes aegypti in Burkina Faso. Methods: Two laboratory experiments were conducted using 3-5-day old wild-derived female An. coluzzii and Aedes aegypti. Each experiment included four replicates per IVM concentration and was performed on separate dates. Mosquitoes were fed via membrane feeding on rabbit blood treated with five concentrations of IVM (C=112 ng/ml, C2=29 ng/ml, C3=15 ng/ml, C4=6.5 ng/ml, C5=2.5ng/ml), corresponding to the mean human plasma levels at 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 days post-MDA with IVM at a dose of 300 {micro}g/kg. A negative control (C6=0.0 ng/ml) was also included. Mosquito mortalities were recorded daily for 7 days. Fecundity was measured by counting both laid eggs and developed eggs (via ovary dissection). Results: IVM significantly reduced the survival of An. coluzzii compared to the control group (p<0.001), with the risk of death increasing from 4.2-fold at the lowest concentration (2.5 ng/ml) to 64.2-fold at the highest (112 ng/ml). In contrast, IVM had no significant effect on Aedes aegypti (p>0.05). Additionally, in An. coluzzii, IVM significantly reduced both egg laying and egg development (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively), whereas no significant impact on fecundity was observed in Ae. aegypti (all p>0.80). Conclusion: Ivermectin concentrations typically achieved in human plasma during mass drug administration campaigns were sufficient to significantly reduce both survival and fecundity of wild type An. coluzzii, but had no measurable effect on recently colonized Ae. aegypti.

While GS has become common in major dairy cattle breeds, its implementation in local breeds has begun only more recently or is still in progress. However, the introduction of GS in some major breeds has also been associated with increased inbreeding rates, raising concerns about the potential effects of GS on the genetic diversity in smaller or local breeds. Our aim was to investigate the impact of GS on genetic diversity in five (small) local cattle breeds from three European countries. The five breeds evaluated were: MRY (from the Netherlands), Norwegian Red (from Norway), Abondance, Tarentaise, and Vosgienne (from France). We investigated changes in population demographic structure, as well as trends and rates of kinship and inbreeding, using both pedigree- and genomic-based measures. The population size varied depending on the breed, with Vosgienne being the smallest and Norwegian Red being the largest. The dataset included 4,645 MRY, 193,489 Norwegian Red, 16,427 Abondance, 8,882 Tarentaise, and 4,466 Vosgienne genotyped animals for more than 40,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Overall, following the implementation of GS in these breeds, we observed a reduction in generation intervals for sires, fewer calves that later became sires, and, for the French breeds, a broader sire usage. Such changes were likely due to GS enabling the preselection and screening of more young bulls. Additionally, we observed a more balanced contribution of the top ten sires after the introduction of GS. Although changes in inbreeding and kinship rates occurred after the introduction of GS, there was no consistent pattern across breeds: rates increased in MRY and Tarentaise, but decreased in Norwegian Red, Abondance, and Vosgienne. Our study suggests that changes and increases in inbreeding rates may occur after the introduction of GS, although they may not be directly due to the introduction of GS per se, but rather due to population management strategies, such as optimal contribution selection or other breeding practices implemented at the nucleus level. Our findings emphasise the importance of monitoring changes in both genetic diversity and population demographic structure after implementing GS in local breeds, as well as adjusting breeding strategies when needed to ensure long-term sustainability.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

They were also significantly shorter and less expressed than conserved Coding DNA Sequences (CDS), and their GC content increased with phylogenetic conservation. While most of them were located in intergenic regions, 34 were previously annotated as CDS in at least one genome, and are amongst the most promising gene candidates. Our results illuminate the abundance of translation events outside of conserved CDS, and their role as starting material for the emergence of novel genes.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

However, a comprehensive understanding of the interactome of NR2E3 remains elusive. Here, we aimed to map the interactome of this nuclear receptor and the G56R pathogenic variant through proximity labelling followed by mass spectrometry. We used the TurboID T2A split/link design to identify the proximity interactome of wild-type NR2E3 and mutant G56R-NR2E3 in ARPE-19 cells. Several protein complexes involved in retinal development, including the AP-1 complex, were enriched. The results suggest similar interactomes for NR2E3 and G56R-NR2E3 in ARPE-19. However, BCOR was exclusively enriched in the G56R-NR2E3 network, strengthening the connection with the IRD phenotype.

However, how the human brain extracts animacy information from BM remains largely unclear. The current study investigated this issue using visual adaptation, a non-invasive tool for revealing neural mechanisms underlying the selective processing of specific properties. Results showed that prolonged exposure to intact human walkers, compared to non-BM adaptors, biased the perception of subsequent walking stimuli towards less animate. This adaptation aftereffect persisted following adaptation to local foot motions carrying diagnostic kinematic cues, but was absent after exposure to static body forms, indicating the involvement of neuronal populations encoding animacy from BM based on motion signals. Moreover, adapting to pigeon movements also biased animacy perception for human motions, revealing a shared mechanism for encoding animacy from cross-species BM signals. These results support the existence of an inherent \"life detection\" system in the human brain, attuned to local foot motions and kinematic features prevalent in vertebrate movements, which may lay a foundation for perceiving life from motion across terrestrial species.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

In four collaborative workshops, cooperative managers and multidisciplinary researchers jointly designed six feasible deployment strategies. These scenarios, implemented within real vineyards, involve planting resistant cultivars (RC) in vineyards (i) more than 30 years old, (ii) on 3.3% of the older plots each year or (iii) on plots located in no-treatment zone (due to proximity to watercourses or human dwellings), with and without a fixed maximum percentage of resistant cultivars in the vineyard. The strategies were evaluated with the landsepi model, which simulates the spread and evolution of pathogens across agricultural landscapes in response to host resistance deployment. The assessment criteria included downy mildew control efficacy, resistance durability, decrease in fungicide use, and economic benefits for individual vineyards and the cooperative. These scenarios led us to study more specifically the effects of two little-studied factors: (i) the presence or absence of fungicide applications and (ii) the massive or progressive introduction of resistant cultivars. Fungicide application substantially decreases the risk of resistance breakdown and complements the epidemiological control provided by resistant cultivars, particularly when the fitness costs of virulence are low. The probability of pathogens adapted to RC becoming established was generally lower with progressive than massive RC introduction; however, when establishment did occur, the time to establishment was shorter for progressive strategies at a cropping ratio [&ge;] 50%. Ultimately, the choice of RC introduction strategy had a minimal overall impact on disease control due to compensatory epidemiological and evolutionary processes, including dilution effects, and the probability and timing of resistance breakdown. These results are discussed in the broader framework of action-research approaches and the challenges and opportunities for resistant cultivar adoption by vine-growers.

SHANK3 encodes a synaptic scaffolding protein with critical roles in neurodevelopment and synaptic function, and aberrant SHANK3 methylation has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Reliable locus-specific assays are required to investigate its epigenetic regulation. Methods: The SHANK3 sequence (NCBI Gene ID: 85358) was screened in silico to identify CpG islands. A CpG-rich region upstream of exon 3 was selected for assay development. Bisulfite-converted sequences representing fully methylated and unmethylated states were aligned, and three primer sets were designed accordingly. Bisulfite conversion was performed using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit, and conversion efficiency was confirmed with the DAPK1 control assay and commercially available methylated and unmethylated genomic DNAs. High-resolution melting (HRM) analyses were carried out on LightCycler 480 and CFX96 platforms. Results: Primer Sets 1 and 3 consistently amplified the target region and produced distinct melting profiles that discriminated methylated from unmethylated templates, whereas Primer Set 2 was less efficient. Gradient PCR optimization identified 54 celcius degree as the optimal annealing temperature. Non-template controls showed late-cycle amplification and nonspecific products, but these were distinguished by melting temperatures lower than those of the expected amplicon and did not interfere with interpretation.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Recent data demonstrate a complex crosstalk between lipid metabolism and inflammation, suggesting potential contribution of the lipid-rich brain environment to neuroinflammation. While recent data support the importance of brain lipid environment to inflammatory changes observed in age related chronic neurodegenerative diseases, in vivo interactions between lipid environment, lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation in acute brain disease and injury remain poorly understood. Here we utilize a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to demonstrate that acute neurotrauma leads to widespread lipid metabolism reprograming in all microglial and brain associated and infiltrating monocyte populations. Additionally, we identify unique microglial and monocyte populations with higher degree of lipid metabolism reprograming and pronounced accumulation of neutral storage lipids, including cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. These lipids accumulate not only in lipid droplets but also in the microglial and monocyte lysosomes and are associated with lysosomal dysfunction and inhibition of autophagy after TBI. Our data indicate that lipid accumulation in these cells is the result of altered lipid handling rather than lipid synthesis and is triggered by phagocytosis of lipid-rich myelin debris generated after TBI. Finally, we use mice with autophagy defects in microglia and monocytes to demonstrate that further inhibition of autophagy leads to more pronounced lipid metabolism reprograming and exacerbated cellular lipid accumulation. Our data suggest a pathological feedback loop, where lipid phagocytosis causes inhibition of autophagy-lysosomal function, which in turn exacerbates cellular lipid retention, reprograming and inflammation.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

We sought to develop a reagent-free workflow for CRISPR/Cas9 editing in human immortalized myoblasts and to demonstrate its performance in two use cases, an IARS1 knockout and an MLIP homozygous knock-in. Methods: We optimized electroporation parameters using a green fluorescent protein reporter to compare three electrical settings for transfection and survival in E6/E7 myoblasts, then applied ribonucleoprotein delivery for editing. We evaluated the effect of confluency at electroporation, performed single-cell cloning without antibiotics or fluorescence-activated sorting, and validated edits by high-resolution melting pre-screen followed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Electroporation optimization identified one parameter set that maximized delivery while preserving viability. Performing electroporation at low confluency increased clonal outgrowth and editing rates. The workflow yielded an 84% success rate for IARS1 knockout and a 3.3% success rate for MLIP homozygous knock-in. High-resolution melting provided a very sensitive pre-screen, detecting 96% to 100% of actual edits, reducing the number of Sanger sequencing needed. Performance was reproducible across runs and myoblast lines and increasing single-cell seeding scaled yields without compromising purity. Conclusions: This work provides a practical and reproducible selection-free protocol that couples electroporation optimization, low confluency editing, single-cell cloning, and high-resolution melting sorting to generate pure edited myoblast lines.

However, chemotherapy only has modest effects at improving patient survival due to primary or rapidly acquired chemoresistance. The biological underpinnings of PDAC therapy resistance are incompletely defined, but the tumor microenvironment is known to be a major contributor to chemoresistance. We have found chemoresistance is imprinted on PDAC cells by the tumor microenvironment and persists for a period of days after PDAC cells are removed from tumors. However, PDAC chemoresistance is lost upon long term culture in standard laboratory conditions. Interestingly, culture of PDAC cells in Tumor Interstitial Fluid Medium (TIFM), a culture medium we developed to recapitulate the nutrient availability of the tumor microenvironment, maintains PDAC cells in a chemo- and targeted therapy resistant state even after long term culture ex vivo. These findings suggest that microenvironmental metabolic stress keeps PDAC cells in a physiologically relevant, therapy resistant cell state that standard culture models fail to maintain. Using TIFM culture, we sought to understand how PDAC cells in this state resist therapeutic challenge. We found that chemo- and targeted therapies largely retain on-target activity within TIFM medium but fail to activate cell death, enabling a chemotolerant cell state, which is also observed in PDAC tumors. This chemotolerant state is driven by suppression of apoptotic priming and can be overcome by targeting the anti-apoptotic regulator BCL-XL. Taken together, these findings suggest that reprogramming of cell death mechanisms by the PDAC nutrient microenvironment is a key contributor to therapy resistance in this disease.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Here we show that in PDAC cell lines with amplified MYC, MondoA is required for viability, facilitating proliferation while suppressing apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptional and genomic profiling demonstrates that loss of MondoA leads to altered expression of direct MondoA targets as well as MYC target genes and is accompanied by shifts in genomic occupancy of MYC, MNT, and the MondoA paralog ChREBP. This altered genomic binding by MYC network members is associated with transcriptional perturbation of multiple metabolic and stress pathways, as well as global changes in N6-methyladenosine modification (m6A) of mRNA. MondoA inhibition disrupts coordination between MYC network members and the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), resulting in decreased translation of ATF4 mRNA, discordant gene regulation of shared targets of MYC and ATF4 and, ultimately, apoptosis. Re-establishing ATF4 protein expression rescues the diminished viability due to loss of MondoA expression or activity, providing direct evidence of a link between deregulated MYC and the transcriptional machinery of the ISR. Lastly, we find that small-molecule inhibition of MondoA is lethal in a subset of PDAC cell lines, including patient-derived organoids, suggesting that the ability to target MYC via chemical inhibition of MondoA transcriptional activity may have broad efficacy.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

To reveal how these processes are mechanistically linked, we combined acute molecule perturbations in live cells with correlative 3D electron tomography or MINFLUX super-resolution microscopy. We show that degrading Nup62 during mitosis arrests NPC assembly at an intermediate step with smaller membrane pores and removes the whole central transport channel. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that 32 copies of the central channel subcomplex, recruited into the previously unoccupied pore center, can self-associate via hydrophobic interactions to occupy the volume required for full pore size and exert an outward pushing force; indeed, disrupting these interactions during NPC assembly blocked pore dilation. Later in mitotic exit, perturbed cells exhibited impaired nuclear import, smaller nuclei, and looser NE spacing. Acute inhibition of nuclear import recapitulated these NE defects without affecting NPC assembly. Together, our findings reveal a new, two-step molecular mechanism linking NPC assembly and NE reformation. First, hydrophobic FG-nucleoporins dilate the assembling nuclear pore to its full width by forming the central transport channel, which then allows nuclear import-driven nuclear expansion leading to tight, regular NE membrane spacing.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

During quiescence exit, the centromere is reassembled and rapidly regains normal homeostatic levels of centromere proteins. Although the histone variant CENP-A is typically deposited during G1, we find that CENP-A deposition does not occur during the G1 immediately following quiescence exit, and instead occurs after cells complete their first mitosis. In contrast, other centromere proteins relocalize during the first S phase independent of DNA replication.

In bone, radiation-induced toxicity is characterized by loss of hematopoietic function, reduced bone volume, and increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT). Importantly, cancer patients who undergo radiotherapy exhibit significantly higher fracture risk compared to those receiving similar treatments without radiation exposure, underscoring the clinical consequences of bone microenvironment (BME) injury. The BME is inherently hypoxic resulting in the activation of by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling. Here, we demonstrate that radiation induces a rapid and persistent accumulation of MAT, with adipocytes localizing preferentially to hypoxic regions of the marrow. To investigate the role of hypoxia/HIF signaling in this process, we generated aP2Cre;Hif-1 fl/fl;Hif-2fl/fl conditional knockout mice. Surprisingly, these mice exhibited increased MAT expansion following radiation compared to controls, suggesting that HIF deletion in aP2-expressing cells exacerbates radiation-induced adipogenesis. Analysis aP2CreRosa26tdTomato/+ mice revealed that most aP2-expressing cells did not give rise to mature adipocytes, macrophages, or endothelial cells, pointing instead to an uncharacterized stromal population that influences MAT formation. In contrast, conditional ablation of HIF transcription factors in LepRCre-expressing skeletal stem cells, which contain a subpopulation of skeletal progenitors which directly contribute to marrow adipocytes, had no effect on radiation-induced MAT expansion. Collectively, these findings identify a previously unrecognized population of adipocyte-regulatory cells whose HIF-dependent activity constrains stress-induced marrow adiposity.

However, the role of K63-linked poly-ubiquitination has been explored in various cellular processes like DNA repair, endocytosis, innate immune response, kinase activation, etc. Since K63-linked poly-ubiquitination can regulate the stability, localization, and activity of its target molecules, its regulation and function in various developmental and disease contexts are being explored. Here, we investigate how K63 ubiquitination regulates Drosophila blood cell homeostasis. Ubc13 (UBE2N), an E2 conjugating enzyme, is highly expressed in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), wherein it controls innate immune signalling for the survival of AML cells; however, its role during developmental hematopoiesis is less explored. In Drosophila, Bendless is the functional homolog of Ubc13, whose role in stem cell regulation and particularly hematopoiesis is unknown. Our results indicate that spatial genetic perturbation of Bendless and its associated molecules, namely Uev1a, Effete, and E3 ligase - Traf6, that mediate K63 ubiquitination, are critical for maintaining hematopoietic progenitors and regulating their differentiation. We show that Bendless-mediated K63 ubiquitination controls the Wingless signalling pathway by regulating Dishevelled in the larval lymph gland (LG), thereby modulating hematopoietic progenitor maintenance and differentiation. Furthermore, an excess of K63 ubiquitination activates the JNK pathway in the LG, resulting in lamellocyte production. Genetic epistasis analysis shows that activation of the canonical Wingless pathway in the background of Bendless depletion or inactivation of the JNK pathway in Bendless over-expression conditions can restore physiological hematopoiesis. Our findings indicate that regulators of K63 ubiquitination, like Bendless, could act as molecular inter-nodes that are capable of signalling cross-regulation, especially where intricate signalling networks are involved.

However, specialized mutualisms are relatively rare in nature. Few empirical studies have directly examined how multi-partner interactions affect mutualistic evolution, largely because tracking partner dynamics over evolutionary timescales is challenging in natural systems. We circumvent this constraint via experimental evolution with an engineered resource sharing mutualism in Bakers yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which allows precise control of partner fidelity across generations. We compared high partner fidelity (consistent pairings) with low partner fidelity (temporally rotating partners) across 54 rounds of selection. High partner fidelity produced the strongest mutualistic benefits (7.2% increased growth over controls), while low partner fidelity yielded only modest benefits (2.2% increase). Time-shift experiments confirmed that while coevolution enhanced benefit evolution, it was not strictly necessary: benefits also evolved through one-sided adaptation. Genomic analyses revealed parallel evolution in amino acid metabolism and starvation response genes, with the slower-growing genotype driving most evolutionary change. Surprisingly, high-fidelity lineages evolved as generalists rather than specialists, cooperating equally well with all partners tested. Overall, these results demonstrate that partner fidelity facilitates the rapid evolution of mutualistic benefits but is not strictly required for mutualistic evolution.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

In C. elegans, genetic screens have identified regulators of RNA-binding protein condensation in arrested oocytes of females and in embryos, but less attention has focused on phase transitions in maturing oocytes of young adult hermaphrodites. Interestingly, of the relatively few regulators of RNA-binding protein phase transitions identified to date in maturing oocytes, several genes overlap with those required for clearance of protein aggregates in maturing oocytes. To determine the extent to which the temporally linked processes of clearance of damaged proteins and maintenance of RNP complexes are coordinated at a molecular level, we conducted a targeted RNAi screen of genes required for removal of protein aggregates in maturing oocytes.

However, phylogenetic inference from single-cell RNA sequencing is challenging due to sparse and noisy data and large dataset sizes. We present a novel tree inference method designed for such data that takes reference and alternative read counts of single-nucleotide variants and reconstructs a phylogenetic tree of the sequenced cells via maximum likelihood using a random-scan greedy search. To overcome local optima in the search, our algorithm alternates between two different tree representations: cell lineage trees, where cells are represented by nodes and mutations are attached to edges, and mutation trees, where mutation nodes encode the mutational events and cells are attached to them. Because a local optimum in one tree space generally does not correspond to a local optimum in the other space, we maximize the likelihood by switching between the two tree spaces until convergence is achieved in both. We demonstrate superior performance of our approach on simulated data with complex clonal architectures compared to existing methods.

However, many existing metagenome analysis tools require advanced computational expertise and are not designed for monitoring. We present MMonitor, an open source software platform for the real-time analysis and visualization of metagenomic Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing data. MMonitor includes two components: a desktop application for running bioinformatics pipelines through a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI), and a web-based dashboard for interactive result inspection. The dashboard provides taxonomic composition over time, quality scores, diversity indices, and taxonomy-metadata correlations. Integrated pipelines enable automated de-novo assembly and reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). To validate MMonitor, we tracked human gut microbial populations in three bioreactors using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and applied it to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data to generate high-quality annotated MAGs and reveal functional insights. We also compare MMonitor to other software for real-time metagenomic analysis, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each tool for this use case. By performing automated time-series analyzes, sample management, and updating of reference databases, MMonitor addresses current limitations and supports dynamic microbiome research in various fields.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

As contestants in that challenge, we developed a computational strategy that ranked on the top among all 23 participants in the competition and resulted in the discovery of a novel chemical series of non-charged Mac1 inhibitors. Those have been identified through the combination of machine learning-accelerated virtual screening of Enamine REAL Diversity Subset of approximately 25 million compounds and consequent hit expansion into the entire Enamine REAL Space library. In particular, the initially identified hit compound CACHE3-HI_1706_56 (KD = 20 uM) was explored by probing 17 close analogues from a library of 44 billion molecules from the Enamine REAL. All those analogues effectively displaced the Mac1-binding ADP-ribose peptide, and 12 were confirmed to engage with Mac1 by the Surface Plasmon Resonance experiments, revealing a new chemical series of compounds for hit-to-lead optimization. The structure of the CACHE3-HI_1706_56-Mac1 complex was further determined at high resolution with crystallography, confirming initial computational predictions.

In this study, we investigated the growth performance of the ambrosia fungus Dryadomyces montetyi, the primary symbiont of the oak pinhole borer Platypus cylindrus, on semi-artificial media infused with extracts of four tree species: Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica, Abies alba, and Pseudotsuga menziesii. Fungal growth was quantified over time using logistic growth models, and final biomass was assessed through dry weight measurements. The growth of D. montetyi differed significantly among the different host tree substrates. Growth on F. sylvatica was comparable to that on Q. robur; however, both conifer-derived media (A. alba and P. menziesii) exhibited significantly reduced surface expansion and biomass accumulation. Tissue density measurements further indicated that the mycelium grown on Q. robur was denser than that grown on conifer media, although overall density was highest on a nutrient-rich medium without tree extract. These results demonstrate that D. montetyi performs best on angiosperm hosts, particularly oak, which aligns with the known host preferences of P. cylindrus. Our findings suggest that fungal performance is not solely determined by the typical polyphagy of ambrosia beetles but also reflects the host-related specialization of the fungal symbiont. This specialization certainly determines the host selection of P. cylindrus and the evolution of the tripartite interactions between this beetle, D. montetyi, and oak trees.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Depletion of commensal microbiota increases Ca burden and promotes dissemination, yet the mechanisms of microbiota-mediated Ca colonization resistance remain poorly defined. Here, we show that gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) directly inhibit Ca growth by impairing hexose uptake, disrupting central carbon metabolism, and inducing intracellular acidification. In vivo, SCFAs enhance Ca colonization resistance only in the presence of an intact gut microbiome, which is required to drive SCFA-induced taxonomic shifts that further augment resistance. Commensal microbiota lacking SCFA production exhibit diminished capacity to restrict Ca colonization, while prebiotic therapy that increases luminal SCFA levels enhances Ca clearance. These findings define a critical microbiota-metabolite mechanism underlying Ca colonization resistance and suggest strategies to modulate GI fungal burden and prevent invasive disease.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Bacteria can adapt to specific host environments over evolutionary timescales, leading to co-speciation and the formation of specialized host microbe relationships. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations provides key insights into the evolution of symbiosis and the stability of microbial communities. This study investigates the co-speciation and molecular adaptations of Curvibacter to its host Hydra, a well-established model for the study of host-microbe interactions. We provide strong evidence of co-speciation, as demonstrated by phylogenetic congruence between different Hydra species and their corresponding Curvibacter symbionts, along with preferential recolonization of germ-free Hydra by their native Curvibacter strains. Comparative genomic analyses reveal that host-associated Curvibacter strains exhibit distinct metabolic and biosynthetic adaptations compared to their free-living relatives. Specifically, the enrichment of proteins involved in sugar metabolism and transport, as well as the selective purification of proteins linked to macromolecule biosynthesis, highlights the specialization of Curvibacter symbionts within the Hydra glycocalyx. Functional experiments identify a symbiont-specific extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) operon as key factor for microbial adhesion and host colonization, underscoring its role in facilitating symbiont specificity and stability.

The antibiotic-resistant pathogen Staphylococcus aureus can obtain phosphate from divergent environments and possesses accessory-transporter pairs from all three identified groups. Investigations with S. aureus revealed that all three accessory proteins can regulate phosphate homeostasis, but that there is a hierarchy, which is dictated by the environment. Multiple accessory regulators are independently necessary for S. aureus to cause infection. Thus, microbes possess not one, but multiple distinct groups of accessory regulatory proteins and this diversity enables them to control phosphate homeostasis across environments, including those encountered during infection.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

S. boulardii strains shared conserved genetic features and exhibited a conserved chromosomal inversion on chromosome XVI, lower copy numbers of CAZyme genes, and lineage-specific amino acid substitutions in central and tryptophan catabolism pathways--potentially underlying elevated production of immunomodulatory metabolites.

S.", "abstract": "Background: West Nile (WNV), Usutu (USUV), and Sindbis (SINV) virus were initially detected in the African region, and subsequently across temperate regions where they were absent. Wild birds are primary reservoirs for these arboviruses and are considered major contributors to their global spread through seasonal migration. To understand the transmission dynamics of arboviruses in wild birds and the potential of migratory birds to spread the viruses at an intercontinental scale, we investigated arboviral infections and exposures in African resident and Palearctic migratory birds at wintering locations in Nigeria. Methodology/Principal Findings: Oropharyngeal- and cloacal swabs, feathers and blood were collected from resident and migratory birds at two wintering locations (Amurum and Ngel-Nyaki Forest Reserves). Swabs and feathers were tested using RT-PCR for WNV, USUV and SINV, and blood with ELISA and FRNT90 or PRNT80 for antibodies. 573 birds were sampled between 2021 to 2024 across months coinciding with arrival and departure of migratory birds. USUV RNA was detected in 2.6% of feathers including a positive Icterine warbler and a garden warbler sampled prior to spring migration. None of the swabs was positive for viral RNA but neutralizing antibodies to WNV and USUV were detected in 4.5% of birds. SINV antibodies were also found in 34.1% of birds sampled across the wintering locations. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings showed that migratory birds can become infected with USUV, and potentially with WNV and SINV during their overwintering periods in Africa and highlighted a wider arbovirus risk in Nigeria. In addition, detections of viral RNA in feathers, but not swabs, suggest feathers may be a suitable matrix for surveillance in the absence of a reliable cold chain. The overall detections in wild birds at these locations highlight the need for further surveillance to define the epidemiology and public health risks of these arboviruses in the region.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

One of these proteins is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is responsible for replicating the viral genome. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a well-studied ssRNA+ virus, encodes a membrane-bound RdRp, here termed NS5B, that can form oligomers. NS5B exists in two conformations; only one is believed to be capable of binding RNA. The relationship between membrane localization, oligomerization, and conformation remains unclear. We investigated whether membrane localization mediates NS5B's oligomerization, conformation and function. In solution, NS5B exhibited temperature-dependent oligomerization that correlated with cooperative RNA binding and a conformational shift at micromolar concentrations. In contrast, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that membrane-bound NS5B forms stable, non-terminating oligomers at nanomolar concentrations, often localized near lipid raft domains. The presence of oligomers was correlated with membrane recruitment of RNA and nucleotides, suggesting functional activation. The lower concentration threshold for RNA binding on membranes may be explained by membrane-induced oligomerization that promotes the RNA-binding conformation of NS5B. Our findings are consistent with a model in which membrane association regulates NS5B's function through oligomerization-driven conformational control.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Microbial activity is crucial in driving its degradation, offering a potential avenue for mitigating its environmental impact. Although the degradation pathway for BPF has been identified in various bacteria, the biodegradation mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we isolated a highly efficient BPF-degrading strain of Sphingobium yanoikuyae DN12, which could utilize BPF as the sole carbon source and energy source for growth, from a river sediment in Anhui Province China. Through Ultra performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) analysis, we found that oxidation and hydrolysis are key steps for BPF biodegradation. Utilizing whole-genome sequencing, comparative transcriptomics analysis and biochemical identification, a gene cluster bpf was identified to be involved in BPF degradation. BpfAB is a two-component oxidoreductase responsible for converting BPF to 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHBP). BpfC is a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) responsible for converting DHBP to 4-hydroxyphenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (HPHB). Isotope tracing demonstrated that the oxygen atom incorporated by BpfAB originates from water, whereas that incorporated by BpfC derives from molecular oxygen (O2). BpfD is an /{beta} hydrolase responsible for converting HPHB to 4-hydroxybenzoate (4HB) and 1,4-hydroquinone (HQ). Analysis of the taxonomic and habitat of 325 prokaryotic genomes revealed that BpfA-like homologs are predominantly found in the phylum Pseudomonadota, primarily inhabiting soil and aquatic environments.

Understanding the interplay and correlation between ACE2-determined host range and antigenicity is vitally important for understanding the zoonotic potential of related bat sarbecoviruses. Using binding assays, pseudotype-entry assays and a diverse panel of mammalian ACE2 proteins, we examined the host range and related antigenicity of multiple bat coronaviruses. Broad bat ACE2 usage (a generalist phenotype) was most common in clade 1 sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and the BANAL isolates from Laos. In contrast, clade 3 (e.g., RhGB07) and 5 (e.g., Rc-o319) sarbecoviruses exhibited more restricted ACE2 usage (a specialist phenotype). A novel structure for RhGB07 Spike further helped to identify RBD residues associated with this receptor specialism. Interestingly, the generalist phenotypes were largely maintained with more diverse mammalian receptor libraries, including human, non-human primate, livestock, rodent ACE2 and potential intermediate reservoir hosts (e.g., civet, racoon dog, pangolin), while specialists, like RhGB07, exhibited wider phenotypic diversity. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 continued evolution in humans was also examined, identifying an expanding and/or shifting pattern of generalism for variants, especially Omicron and its sub-lineages. Furthermore, we compared and correlated these entry phenotypes with antigenicity using sera from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals. Clade 1 viruses, phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV-2, were antigenically the most similar, with robust evidence for cross-neutralisation; however, there was still evidence for limited cross-neutralisation across the entire sub-genus. Finally, using monoclonal antibodies, derived from COVID-19 vaccinees with breakthrough infections, we pin-pointed the antibody epitope classes responsible for wider neutralisation. Our research indicates that generalist ACE2-using sarbecoviruses are phylogenetically and antigenically related to SARS-CoV-2.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

S.; McCormick, C.", "abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) encode Spike, Membrane (M), and Envelope (E) transmembrane proteins that are translated and processed at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traverse the secretory pathway to converge at sites of virus assembly. Three transmembrane ER resident proteins, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), sense the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER and initiate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase ER protein folding capacity. We observed UPR modulation by numerous CoV proteins, including Spike, which broadly activated all three arms of the UPR. By contrast, M selectively inhibited the ATF6 arm of the UPR, either when it was activated by CoV proteins like Spike, or when it was activated by chemical stimuli of ER stress; however, M was unable to inhibit Spike-mediated activation of IRE1 or PERK. ATF6 inhibition was conserved amongst all human CoV M proteins. Amongst the UPR sensors, ATF6 has a unique activation mechanism whereby ER stress triggers translocation to the Golgi where ATF6 is processed by resident proteases to release the ATF6-N bZIP transcription factor. Because M had no effect on the function of the ATF6-N transcription factor, we reasoned that it may act upstream by inhibiting ATF6 trafficking in the secretory pathway. Indeed, we observed that ectopically expressed M inhibited several processes that require ER-to-Golgi transport, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP2)-mediated activation of sterol responses and stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STING1)-mediated activation of interferon responses. M also inhibited the secretion of a soluble Gaussia luciferase reporter protein. Using a Retention Using Selective Hooks (RUSH) cargo sorting assay, we observed that M accumulated in the cis-Golgi and inhibited further anterograde transport of a transmembrane reporter protein beyond this compartment, while dispersing the trans-Golgi network (TGN). We also observed a conserved TGN dispersal phenotype in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, hCoV-OC43, or hCoV-229E. We determined that M is present in both detergent resistant and detergent soluble membranes and that M increased cholesterol abundance at the cis-Golgi. Together, these observations suggest that CoV M proteins disrupt the TGN and impede normal anterograde traffic in the canonical secretory pathway, potentially by increasing cholesterol levels at the cis-Golgi. Because CoV egress does not require the TGN, this mechanism could allow the virus to selectively interfere with host responses to infection without impeding egress of nascent virions.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Changes between hosts and vectors involve exposure to stressful environments, for which it has developed different strategies to cope with such stress. L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase (TDH) is a key enzyme in trypanosome metabolism, and several studies have shown that inhibiting TDH affects parasite survival. To understand the role of TDH in T. cruzi, we investigated its expression in different benznidazole (Bz)-resistant clones and overexpressed it in a Bz-susceptible clone. After overexpressing TDH and exposing it to reactive oxygen species (ROS), alkylating agents, and drugs such as Bz, we evaluated certain biological parameters. Our results show that TDH led to higher survival rates when exposed to H2O2 and increased tolerance to Bz. Moreover, the parasites were able to infect more cells, and their mitochondrial membrane potential ({Psi}m) remained unchanged, both of which are linked to higher tolerance to ROS. Finally, parasites overexpressing TDH were less vulnerable to genetic damage caused by agents such as MMS and gamma radiation. Overall, our results demonstrate that TDH, a key enzyme in threonine metabolism, helps combat stressful environments and, under certain experimental conditions, supports the survival of parasites.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Results demonstrate that the detection error decreases with the number of independent populations and increases with the sequence length.

The workflow begins with input processing, where peak files are standardized and reference GTF files are decomposed into chromosome-specific feature collections. The core analysis modules then perform bidirectional mapping: peak-to-gene identifies which genes are potentially regulated by specific genomic regions, while gene-to-peak reveals which regulatory elements might influence particular genes of interest. Throughout this process, nearest-feature detection algorithms handle the complex spatial relationships between genomic elements, considering factors like distance constraints and feature overlaps. Finally, the results are formatted into researcher-friendly CSV and Excel outputs, providing a comprehensive view of the genomic landscape that connects regulatory elements to their potential gene targets.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

V.; Bittmann, F. N.", "abstract": "Musculoskeletal complaints and non-contact injuries remain poorly understood. The pushing maximum strength usually examined does not represent the muscle action at which injuries occur: when muscles hold or brake under load. This study focuses on the new approach of muscle stability (Adaptive Force; AF) - the capacity to adapt to increasing external loads. To obtain a comprehensive picture of this unique muscle function, its special features and to demonstrate practical applications, the available AF data are synthesized and re-evaluated supplemented by single cases. AF data from 481 stable and 307 unstable trials of 112 muscles (elbow/hip flexors, pectoralis major) from six studies were included. All studies used an objectified manual muscle test to assess AF in both conditions (stable/unstable) in identical muscles. The respective conditions were elicited by various interventions. The maximum AF (AFmax; peak force), the maximum isometric AF (AFisomax; holding capacity), AF at onset of oscillations (AFosc) and their ratios were analyzed by a mixed ANOVA between stable and unstable muscles including the factors muscle, tester, participant's sex and experiment. Unstable muscles had highly significant reduced AFisomax, but higher AFmax and AFosc. The relative holding capacity was ~56% in unstable and ~99% in stable state. The absolute parameters showed an interaction effect for \"tester\" - probably a design artifact. The relative AF parameters were robust to all factors. The results indicate muscles are not weak in response to impairing stimuli (higher AFmax during lengthening), but unstable: they are unable to generate their full force in static position and yield at clearly submaximal forces. This most likely destabilizes joints under load which could be a key factor in injury and complaint development. Muscles can immediately switch between stability and instability in response to various stimuli. This makes the AF a valuable tool for personalized diagnostics and therapy derivation. We suggest shifting the focus from strength to stability and from load to resilience. The robustness of the relative holding capacity makes it independent of reference values, thus offers the properties of a gold standard. Further studies are required to validate the approach.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

In cheese rind community and co-culture experiments, A. westerdijkiae strongly inhibited most cheese rind community members. In co-culture with Staphylococcus equorum, A. westerdijkiae strongly affected bacterial gene expression, including upregulation of a putative bceAB gene cluster that is associated with resistance to antimicrobial compounds in other bacteria.

A.; Seeliger, J. C.", "abstract": "The cell envelope is an oft-cited factor in the ability of mycobacteria to tolerate antibiotics, host immunity, and environmental stress. In vitro studies have led to a prevailing model in which the mycobacterial envelope exhibits low fluidity that hinders the entry of antibiotics and other stressors. Although fluidity affects essential processes and is dynamically regulated across all domains of life, few studies have measured membrane fluidity in live mycobacteria. To address this gap, we used the environmentally-sensitive probe C-Laurdan to develop an imaging- and flow cytometry-based method for measuring cell envelope fluidity directly in live cells. Our approach enables cell envelope labeling across diverse mycobacterial species, including M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. We characterized fluidity as a function of subcellular localization, antibiotic treatment, and genetic perturbation. The unusual growth characteristics of mycobacteria, including polar growth and asymmetric growth and division, contribute to intercellular heterogeneity that is thought to enhance survival under stress. Indeed, we observed that the poles are more fluid than sidewalls, and that the old pole is more fluid than the new pole. Further, daughter cells have unequal membrane fluidity upon division and this asymmetry is reduced in a mutant with decreased asymmetric polar growth. Chemical or genetic disruption of the mycomembrane led to a shared alteration of the fluidity pattern and susceptibility to two antibiotics, suggesting that GP signatures may predict antibiotic susceptibility. This approach expands the toolkit for assessing fluidity in mycobacteria and enables deeper investigation into how biophysical properties influence bacterial physiology and antibiotic susceptibility.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

M.; Bridle, J.", "abstract": "Biological communities are responding to changes in climate through a combination of range shifts and evolution in situ. However, even in systems where we have genomic and phenotypic evidence of recent adaptation, the ecological and fitness consequences of such evolutionary change remain under-explored, especially in terms of consequences for interactions between species. European Lepidoptera are excellent systems for understanding such shifts, given our exceptional knowledge of their ecology, natural history, and past distributions. The UK Brown Argus butterfly (Aricia agestis) has expanded rapidly northward in response to climate change. This expansion has been associated with evolutionary shifts in maternal host preference, from the chalkland restricted but locally common perennial Rockrose (Helianthemum nummularium) to more broadly distributed, but locally rare annual Geraniums (Geraniaceae). Such a rapid range shift offers an excellent opportunity to test how the evolution of novel biotic interactions associated with climate adaptation affects individual fitness and population resilience. Using common garden assays of host preference on females sampled across the UK in 2013 and 2023, we show for the first time that female preference for Geranium molle or Rockrose hosts vary among individuals within as well as among sites and to different extents at different locations. This variation is consistent with genomic signals of recent selective sweeps on these traits. In particular, we show that in 2013, females in the new part of the range are more likely to oviposit on the locally dominant host, while females from the ancestral range will use both hosts, regardless of the locally dominant host. We also demonstrate a significant temporal shift in behaviour, with a narrowing of host preference towards Geranium molle recorded in A.agestis' ancestral range in 2023. To evaluate the fitness consequences of these shifts in biotic interactions, we assessed larval performance of 1412 larvae from 49 families on both host plants. Irrespective of maternal preference, feeding on Geranium molle hosts conferred higher survival, faster development and larger adult body size under laboratory conditions. These fitness outcomes are likely linked to Geranium molle's significantly higher protein: carbohydrate ratio when compared to Rockrose. Moreover, we also found that larvae fed Geranium molle produced adults with elevated mass-independent resting metabolic rates, a rare demonstration that larval diet has lasting metabolic consequences in a wild butterfly. Crucially, we found no evidence of trade-offs between preference and performance: even offspring of females that laid exclusively on Rockrose also performed better on Geranium molle. These results suggest that Geranium molle confers a general performance advantage, enhancing traits likely to promote population persistence where Geranium molle is reliably available. However, despite selection favouring Geranium molle in warming climates, we also show that a narrowing of host preference towards these more widespread host plants throughout the UK range is likely to make A.agestis populations more vulnerable under future warmer, drier conditions, when compared to Rockrose. Together these findings highlight a central challenge in evolutionary biology: what happens when traits that are adaptive in the short term spread rapidly through populations, but are likely to become maladaptive as environmental conditions continue to change?", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Habitat isolation and sexual isolation are often the first barriers between closely related species, yet they are rarely studied together, making their relative contributions to reproductive isolation unclear. We conducted the first comprehensive study of both barriers in Hawaiian swordtail crickets (Laupala), focusing on the recently diverged, sympatric species pair Laupala kona and Laupala hualalai. Through field surveys, we quantified microhabitat use, spatial distribution, and diel singing activity, and found extensive ecological overlap: both species occupied similar substrates, elevations, and microclimates, and occurred in mixed-species aggregations. Despite this weak habitat isolation, they have divergent sexual traits and exhibit strong sexual isolation in lab assays. The species differ significantly in male pulse rate and cuticular hydrocarbon profiles, and females consistently preferred conspecific song stimuli. Mating trials showed complete sexual incompatibility between heterospecific pairs, with no successful copulations. Together, these results demonstrate that sexual isolation, rather than habitat partitioning, maintains species boundaries between L. hualalai and L. kona in sympatry. Our findings highlight the sufficiency of sexual isolation to prevent hybridization even in the absence of ecological divergence, providing rare empirical evidence that sexual barriers alone can maintain reproductive isolation in natural populations.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we examine the impact of these variables in over twenty enASCas12a multiple gRNA based perturbation screens performed using Humagne C, Humagne D and Inzolia libraries in human cells. We demonstrate that the choice of CRISPR library is often the most significant factor that influences genetic perturbation results, outweighing other variables such as either target cell lines or culture media conditions. A major contributor to this effect is gRNA representation bias within a given CRISPR library, where lower gRNA representation can lead to variable and more pronounced gene effect scores using either log fold change or Chronos analysis. These effects may be mitigated by using either multiple gRNA constructs per gene, by optimisation of CRISPR library production processes or by targeting with multiple independent gRNA libraries. Importantly, we also consider gRNA representation bias during CRISPR screen hit prioritisation.

L.", "abstract": "Episodic memory involves remembering the what, when, and where components of an event. It has been observed in humans, other vertebrates, and cephalopods. In clever behavioral experiments, cuttlefish have been shown to have episodic-like memory, where they demonstrate the ability to remember when and where a preferred food source will appear. The present work replicates this behavior with a parsimonious model of episodic memory. To further test this model and explore episodic-like memory, we introduce a predator-prey scenario in which the agent must remember what creatures (e.g. predator, desirable prey, or less desirable prey) appear at a given time and region of the model environment. This simulates similar situations that cephalopods face in the wild. They will typically hide when predators are in the area, and hunt for prey when available. When the memory model is queried for an action (e.g., hunt or hide), the cuttlefish agent hunts for preferred food, like shrimp, when available, and hides at other times when a predator appears. When the memory model is queried for a place, the cuttlefish agent acts opportunistically, seeking less-preferred food (e.g., crabs) if it is located farther from a predator. These differences show how behavior can be altered depending on how memory is accessed. Querying the model over time might mimic mental time travel, a hallmark of episodic memory. Although developed with cephalopods in mind, the model shares similarities with the hippocampal indexing theory and captures aspects of vertebrate episodic memory. This suggests that the underlying mechanisms supporting episodic-like behavior in the present model may not be unique to cephalopods.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

To assess whether blood-based Fora meters provide more reliable urine measurements for diabetes detection. METHODS Standard solutions of glucose, BHB, and acetoacetate in artificial urine were analyzed using Fora meters and dipstick tests. Urine samples from 37 random dogs and 27 random cats were tested and results were analyzed using regression analysis, confusion matrices, and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS Fora meters accurately detected glucose and BHP ketone levels in artificial urine with strong linearity to standards. Urine dipstick tests showed moderate accuracy (74%) but low sensitivity (57%) for glucose; performance varied by species and specific gravity. Urine dipstick test underestimate specific gravity in samples with high pH or high glucose levels. Urine dipstick tests cannot be used for BHP ketone measurements (sensitivity < 1%).

To improve generalization and personalization, we incorporate transfer learning in two ways: across datasets to adapt models trained on large cohorts to smaller clinical datasets, and at the patient level to personalize models using limited individual data, hence demonstrating the use of precision medicine.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

A.; Choi, Y.", "abstract": "The adaptive immune system monitors cellular integrity by recognizing short peptides from intracellular proteins presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, collectively termed peptide-MHC complexes (pMHC), enabling detection of foreign or mutated proteins. With the rising importance of immunotherapies targeting neoantigens in cancers, the ability to accurately predict which peptides will bind to the diverse population of MHC alleles is critically important. Current computational methods for pMHC-I prediction fall broadly into sequence-based methods, which rely heavily on large training datasets, and structure-based methods that leverage structural modeling and energetics of pMHC binding. While sequence-based methods have been popularly used, their performance is dependent on the size and quality of training data. On the other hands, while structure-based approaches can generalize better across diverse MHC alleles, they traditionally depend on identifying a single global minimum energy conformation, an assumption that often fails due to the inherent binding promiscuity of MHC-I molecules. To address these limitations, we developed a STRUMP-I (STRUcture-based pMHC Prediction (for class I)), a novel pMHC binding prediction tool that directly leverages a broad set of force-field-derived energy terms as machine-learning features. STRUMP-I achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art sequence-based models while significantly outperforming them on MHC alleles with limited representation in training data. Furthermore, STRUMP-I demonstrates strong synergy when integrated with sequence-based methods, notably enhancing prediction precision. The robustness and generalizability of STRUMP-I were confirmed by evaluating its predictive performance on independent, previously unseen datasets, including an experimentally validated cancer neoantigen dataset. This combined approach advances our capability to reliably identify clinically relevant neoantigen targets.

Conventional ARG detection methods, including sequence-alignment and machine learning, are limited by high false-negative or false-positive rates, especially due to sequence diversity and class imbalance in metagenomic data. Moreover, few tools offer comprehensive solutions for ARG identification, classification, and functional annotation. To address these limitations, we developed ESMARG, a novel protein language model framework based on ESM1v, for accurate ARG identification, classification, and annotation. Trained with both ARG and abundant non-ARG sequences from real-world metagenomes to enhance robustness and reduce false positives, ESMARG significantly outperformed traditional alignment-based (BLAST, DIAMOND) and recent deep learning models (ARGNet, ARG-SHINE), achieving 0.998 precision, 0.939 recall, and 0.968 F1-score for ARG identification. Functional and mechanism classification modules also demonstrated high accuracy (0.986 and 0.987) and computational efficiency. We applied ESMARG to analyze 26 cyanobacterial aggregate (CA) metagenomes collected from Lake Taihu across a full annual cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (CyanoHAB) cycle. A total of 110 ARGs, spanning 24 drug classes and multiple resistance mechanisms, were detected, with seasonal shifts in ARG abundance and composition. Strong correlations were identified between CA resistomes and microbial community structure, especially with cyanobacteria. Further, ARG abundance was shaped by both biotic factors-such as cyanobacterial dominance and bacterial functional profiles-and abiotic variables, including biochemical oxygen demand and water temperature. Our findings demonstrate the power of ESMARG for high-resolution ARG profiling and reveal complex ecological interactions between resistomes, microbiomes, and environmental factors in CyanoHAB.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Mutations in ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), a key regulator of DNA demethylation, are common in AML and play a role in its progression and response to treatment. Methods: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of 25 TET2 gene sequences (12 AML and 13 normal) from Pakistani individuals using multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and distance matrix evaluation. We also identified population-specific expression patterns and mutational hotspots. Results: AML samples showed significant deletions in the catalytic domain (positions 693-876) and lower sequence conservation compared to controls. These deletions may impair TET2 enzymatic activity and disrupt the epigenetic regulation. The Phylogenetic tree also showed two significant clades supported by high bootstrap values, differentiating AML from control individuals in the evolutionary direction. Conclusion: Our findings reveal distinct TET2 mutational hotspots associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the Pakistani population. These results have implications for targeted epigenetic therapy and motivate large-scale, cross-population research to unravel the global effects of TET2 variations.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

However, their reliable detection remains challenging due to morphological overlap with other cellular structures, resulting in variability and high levels of false positives. Current artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms further face limitations when confronted with tissue heterogeneity and often underperform in non-tumor, inflamed, or necrotic regions. To address these challenges, Track 1 of MIDOG 2025 challenge expands the scope of mitotic figure detection to include all tissue regions, encompassing both hotspot and non-hotspot areas, thereby promoting real-world clinical applicability. Methods: We propose a generalized deep learning based mitotic detection model (MD model) for robust and accurate detection of mitotic figures using the MIDOG-2025 challenge dataset. Our model enables robust and accurate detection of mitotic figures and demonstrates strong generalization to domain shifts arising from diverse histological regions, variations in scanners, tumor subtypes and laboratory protocols. Results: Our approach showed a consistent performance with an F1-score of 0.7769 with a high recall of 0.8222. Our approach outperforms the baselines and generalizes well across the tumor types on the preliminary test set.

In these models, disease-induced alterations in locomotion and stress resistance are generally monitored in comparison to healthy control flies, such the white-eyed strain w1118, used as a reference for normal physiology and behavior. Here we compared two independent w1118 lines and found that they differed strikingly in their susceptibility to oxidative stress and nutrient starvation, and less markedly in their locomotor performance. Interestingly, modulating the gut microbiome by rearing these flies under axenic conditions increased oxidative stress resistance of the more susceptible, but not the more resistant line, while it had no effect on starvation resistance for both lines. We also found that the stress-sensitive line had higher levels of Clostridiales bacteria and of the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia in the gut microbiota, as well as lower expression levels of immune effectors (antimicrobial peptides and lysozymes) in the head and gut. Both lines nevertheless showed similar susceptibility to pathogenic bacterial infections. In a transgenic Parkinson's disease model, the stress-resistant background strongly attenuated the progressive locomotor defects induced by pan-neuronal expression of human mutant -synuclein, but intriguingly not when -synuclein expression was restricted to a subset of brain dopaminergic neurons in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster. These results suggest that taking into account unapparent features of the reference lines could improve the reproducibility and consistency of neurodegenerative disease models in Drosophila.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

In this study, a Drosophila model of chronic light-induced stress, we show that photoreceptor neurons accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exhibit Toll-1 activation, in association with Spz ligands and receptor endocytosis. Toll-1 activation in neurons promotes axonal degeneration by inducing expression of the glial phagocytic receptor Draper (Drpr), leading to the engulfment of stressed axons. Genetic interaction analyses indicate that Toll-1 functions upstream of Drpr in a stress-responsive signaling cascade. Importantly, blocking either Toll-1 or Drpr attenuates axon loss under light stress, highlighting their essential roles. Our findings reveal a neuron-glia communication axis in which neuronal innate immune signaling instructs glial phagocytosis, converting sustained environmental stress into structural degeneration. This study provides a mechanistic framework for sterile neurodegeneration and offers insights into how immune receptors regulate nervous system integrity under non-infectious conditions.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

Under lymphopenic conditions, naive T cells proliferate due to a greater availability of homeostatic cues. Proliferating CD8+ T cells acquire a phenotype and functionality that is similar to memory cells and are termed memory-like cells. Since memory cells are thought to have a lower activation threshold than naive cells, it has been proposed that differentiation of potentially autoreactive CD8+ T cells into memory-like cells could drive the breakdown of tolerance under lymphopenic conditions. Here we studied whether lymphopenia induced proliferation and differentiation are required to overcome CD8+ T cell cross-tolerance in irradiated mice. Surprisingly, we found that blocking homeostatic proliferation by IL-7 neutralization did not prevent self-reactivity. CD8+ T cells that remained in a naive state still became effectors upon antigen cross-presentation as efficiently as memory-like cells. Nonetheless, lymphopenia induced proliferation did enhance CD8+ T cell mediated self-reactivity at low T cell frequencies by increasing autoreactive T cell numbers. Thus, although homeostatic proliferation enhances CD8+ T cell anti-self responses, differentiation into memory-like cells is not essential for the breakdown of cross-tolerance after irradiation.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "New insights into the diversity of lymphocyte functions challenges previous dogma about the rigid divide between innate and adaptive immunity. While T cells with canonically diversified receptors are crucial for recognizing novel antigens, other T cell lineages express innate-like receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns. The relative frequency of innate-like to diversifying T cell receptors (iTCRs: dTCRs) varies greatly across vertebrate species and across ontogeny within species. These within-species dynamics can potentially be explained by developmental constraints on immunity, pathogen diversity and exposure, or by trade-offs associated with specificity. To better understand how these factors shape T cell repertoires, we constructed an agent-based model of TCR evolution inspired by the diversity of ontogenic life histories in amphibians but applicable to an array of vertebrate species. Our model features two life stages with distinct parasite populations and life history costs. The model predicts that changes in ontogeny (stage duration, T cell maturation time) and environmental factors (parasite diversity, parasite complexity) exert drastic effects on the stage structure of T cell investment strategies. A better understanding of the evolutionary pressures that shape TCR diversity will provide new insights into lymphocyte evolution and immune investment across organismal development.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": ""}
