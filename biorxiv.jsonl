While this adaptation allows the sensory system to attend to novel cues, does information about the recurring stimulus, particularly its intensity, get compromised? We explored this issue in the locust olfactory system. We found that locusts' innate behavioral response to odorants varied with repetition and stimulus intensity. Counter-intuitively, the stimulus-intensity dependent differences became significant only after adaptation had set in. Adaptation altered responses of individual neurons in the antennal lobe (neural network downstream to insect antenna). These response variations to repetitions of the same stimulus were unpredictable and inconsistent across intensities. Although both adaptation and intensity decrements resulted in an overall reduction in spiking activities across neurons, these changes could be disentangled and information about stimulus intensity was robustly maintained by ensemble neural responses. In sum, these results show how information about odor intensity can be preserved in an adaptation-invariant manner.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Advances in machine learning for computer vision, particularly in pose estimation and action recognition, offer transformative potential to enhance the understanding of animal behaviors. However, the integration of these technologies for behavior recognition remains underexplored, particularly in natural settings. We introduce ASBAR (Animal Skeleton-Based Action Recognition), a novel framework that integrates pose estimation and behavior recognition into a cohesive pipeline. To demonstrate its utility, we tackled the challenging task of classifying natural behaviors of great apes in the wild. Our approach leverages the OpenMonkeyChallenge dataset, one of the largest open-source primate pose datasets, to train a robust pose estimation model using DeepLabCut. Subsequently, we extracted skeletal motion data from the PanAf500 dataset, a collection of in-the-wild videos of gorillas and chimpanzees annotated with nine behavior categories. Using PoseConv3D from MMAction2, we trained a skeleton-based action recognition model, achieving a Top-1 accuracy of 75.3%. This performance is comparable to previous video-based methods while reducing input data size by approximately 20-fold, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and storage. To support further research, we provide an open-source, terminal-based GUI for training and evaluation, along with a dataset of 5,440 annotated keypoints for replication and extension to other species and behaviors.

We assessed node-metastability at the whole-brain level and in 7 canonical resting-state networks (RSNs). Our results revealed a progressive decline in dynamical complexity across the disease continuum. HC exhibited the highest node-metastability, whereas it was substantially reduced in MCI and AD patients. The cortical hierarchy of information processing was also disrupted, indicating that rich-club hubs may be selectively affected in AD progression. Furthermore, we used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the influence of Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau pathology on brain dynamics at both regional and whole-brain levels. We found significant associations between both protein burdens and alterations in node metastability. Lastly, a machine learning classifier trained on brain dynamics, A{beta}, and tau burden features achieved high accuracy in discriminating between disease stages.

However, their remodeling upon metabolic challenges remains incompletely characterized, thus complicating the development of safe medications against the surge of metabolic diseases. Oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) are one of the key effectors regulating energy balance. In this work, we report that high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice evokes spatiotemporally selective ATP release from astrocytes (Inflares) in the PVH, accompanied by the expression of hematopoietic lineage-specific ADP/ATP receptor P2Y12 on local OXT (PVHOXT) neurons. Strikingly, increased purinergic signaling leads to impaired responsiveness of PVHOXT neurons accompanied by hyperphagic obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Conversely, loss of P2Y12 in PVHOXT neurons attenuates metabolic phenotypes, illustrating that such remodeling is both necessary and sufficient to induce metabolic phenotypes. Inflares were also induced by hyperglycemia, while emergence of P2Y12 on OXT neurons of patients with diabetes mellitus suggests an evolutionary conserved purinergic response to various metabolic challenges and its potential as a drug target. Accordingly, nasal administration of clinically approved doses of P2Y12 inhibitors counteracts obesity in mice and non-human primates, paving the way for application of these compounds in patients with metabolic disorders.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Other studies, however, indicate an opposite egoistic bias in that subjects are less willing to harm themselves for the benefits of others than for their own benefits. These results highlight the delicate inner workings of moral decision and call for a mechanistic account of hyperaltruistic preference. We investigated the boundary conditions of hyperaltruism by presenting subjects with trade-off choices combing monetary gains and painful electric shocks, or, choices combing monetary losses and shocks. We first showed in study 1 that switching the decision context from gains to losses effectively eliminated the hyperaltruistic preference and the decision context effect was associated with the altered relationship between subjects' instrumental harm (IH) trait attitudes and their relative pain sensitivities. In the pre-registered study 2, we tested whether oxytocin, a neuropeptide linked to parochial altruism, might restore the context-dependent hyperaltruistic preference. We found that oxytocin increased subjects' reported levels of framing the task as harming (vs. helping) others, which mediated the correlation between IH and relative pain sensitivities. Thus, the loss decision context and oxytocin diminished and restored the mediation effect of subjective harm framing, respectively.

The DNA events of recombination are linked to structural components of meiotic chromosomes. Imperatively, the biased resolution of double-Holliday junction intermediates (dHJs) into crossovers occurs within the synaptonemal complex (SC), the meiosis-specific structure that mediates end-to-end synapsis of homologs during the pachytene stage. However, the SC's roles in crossover-specific dHJ resolution remains unclear. Here, we show that key SC components function through dependent and interdependent relationships to protect dHJs from aberrant dissolution into noncrossover products. Conditional ablation experiments reveal that cohesin, the core of SC lateral elements, is required to maintain both synapsis and dHJ-associated crossover recombination complexes (CRCs) during pachytene. The SC central region transverse-filament protein is also required to maintain CRCs. Reciprocally, stability of the SC central region requires the continuous presence of CRCs, thereby coupling synapsis and desynapsis to dHJ ormation and resolution. However, dHJ protection and maintenance of CRCs can occur without end-to-end homolog synapsis mediated by the central element of the SC central region. We conclude that local ensembles of SC components are sufficient to enable crossover-specific dHJ resolution and thereby ensure the linkage and segregation of homologous chromosomes.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

As a result of population decline and subdivision, species lose genetic diversity, potentially reducing adaptive potential and increasing genetic load, reinforcing decline. We examine how genetic diversity has changed over the past century in three Polyommatinae butterfly species in Sweden, leveraging genome sequencing of specimens from museum collections. Based on 59 historical and 90 contemporary genomes, we document a 6% decline in genetic diversity in the strongly grassland associated Cyaniris semiargus, driven by increased population isolation. In contrast, generalist Polyommatus icarus and heathland specialist Plebejus argus have largely maintained genetic diversity and connectivity over the study period. The reduction in heterozygosity in Cy. semiargus results from increases in runs of homozygosity. Thus, loss of functional connectivity has led to inbreeding in Cy. semiargus, exposing greater proportions of weakly deleterious mutations and variants in highly conserved regions, in homozygous states. This realized burden likely reduces mean fitness and reinforces population decline, highlighting the need for well-connected grassland landscapes to maintain grassland specialist functional connectivity and genetic diversity. We complement these analyses with five additional Polyommatinae species, uncovering that warning- and alarm rates of decline are found in three of those, including in Cy. semiargus, currently listed as of least concern.

However, the neural mechanisms that support these flexible temporal construals remain unclear. To investigate this, we asked participants to learn a fictional religious ritual of 15 events. During fMRI scanning, they were guided to consider the event series from either an internal or external perspective in different tasks. Behavioral results confirmed the success of our manipulation, showing the expected symbolic distance effect in the internal-perspective task and the reverse effect in the external-perspective task. We found that the activation level in the posterior partial cortex correlated positively with sequential distance in the external-perspective task but negatively in the internal-perspective task. In contrast, the activation level in the anterior hippocampus positively correlated with sequential distance regardless of the observer's perspectives. These results suggest that the hippocampus stores the memory of the event sequences allocentrically in a perspective-agnostic manner. Conversely, the posterior parietal cortex retrieves event sequences egocentrically from the optimal perspective for the current task context. Such complementary allocentric and egocentric representations support both the stability of memory storage and the flexibility of time construals.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "The evolution of female preferences for male display traits relies on females receiving indirect benefits from their mate. This requires substantial genetic variation in display traits or male quality. Nevertheless, sexual selection through mate choice has been assumed to deplete this genetic variation, ultimately diminishing strong preferences. However, sexual traits often have higher genetic variation than non-sexual traits. This contradiction, and, relatedly, how costly preferences and display traits are maintained, is called the \"lek paradox\". Using infinitesimal models, we show that sexual selection through mate choice allows variation in male display traits and female preferences to mutually exaggerate each other, in a process analogous to runaway sexual selection but in terms of genetic variation. Therefore, contrary to prior suppositions, sexual selection may increase equilibrium genetic variance in display traits and preferences over that under random mating, provided that the variance of female preferences relative to male traits during mate choice is not too small and preferences are not too weak. Notably, even if equilibrium preference variation is substantially smaller than trait variation, trait variation can still increase over that under random mating, provided selection on the trait compared to the preference is sufficiently strong. Furthermore, when trait variation does decrease, this reduction is generally slight. It is under situations such as lekking, where females can simultaneously choose from many males so that mate discrimination is effectively strong and fitness costs of choice weak, that sexual selection through mate choice may be most powerful in exaggerating genetic variance in male displays.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

The effectiveness of GS largely depends on the accuracy of genomic prediction (GP) models. However, conventional GP models-primarily based on linear assumptions-often fail to capture the intricate nonlinear and epistatic interactions underlying complex traits, thus limiting their predictive power. To address these limitations, we introduce the contrastive learning and chromosome-aware network (CLCNet), a novel deep learning framework that combines contrastive learning with a chromosome-aware network architecture. CLCNet incorporates two critical components: (i) a contrastive learning module that enhances the model's ability to distinguish phenotypic variation, and (ii) a chromosome-aware module designed to account for local and global epistasis. We benchmarked CLCNet across four diverse crop species-maize (Zea mays), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), rapeseed (Brassica napus), and soybean (Glycine max)-and compared its performance to three traditional models (rrBLUP, Bayesian Ridge, Bayesian Lasso), two machine learning methods (LightGBM, SVR), as well as two deep learning approaches (DNNGP, DeepGS). CLCNet consistently outperformed all comparator models, yielding higher Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) and demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy, generalizability, and scalability across high-dimensional genomic datasets.

Here, we used a Trp53-deficient mouse TE-derived organoid platform to perform combinatorial CRISPR mutagenesis of 20 candidate HGSC driver genes. Mutations in Nf1, Cdkn2a and Map2k4 were most frequently observed in transformed organoids. Upon transplantation into mice, those containing Map2k4 mutations predominantly gave rise to papillary-glandular histology, whereas those containing Nf1 mutations formed more mesenchymal-like carcinomas. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Nf1-mutant tumors of all pathological phenotypes overexpressed the long noncoding RNA Pvt1, a marker associated with poor prognosis in HGSC patients. Map2k4-mutant organoids were more sensitive to paclitaxel and niraparib, while Nf1-mutant combinations responded better to trametinib. Notably, the removal of Rho kinase inhibitor (ROCKi) reduced trametinib sensitivity in both Map2k4- and Nf1-mutant organoids, underscoring the importance of culture conditions and potential antagonistic drug interactions in organoid-based drug screens. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TE-derived organoids coupled with combinatorial CRISPR mutagenesis provide a powerful system to unravel the genetic and phenotypic complexity of HGSC.

We conducted a comprehensive population genetic analysis, utilizing 21 microsatellite markers and data from 2,122 individuals gathered over an extended time from various locations in France. Our results demonstrate the existence of many distinct lineages that reproduce asexually through the years, skipping the sexual phase. A clustering analysis identified a group of multilocus lineages that displayed all hallmarks of the genetic consequences of asexual reproduction, including highly negative and large variance among loci of the inbreeding coefficient (FIS). This indirect evidence for asexual reproduction was confirmed by the direct observation of these asexual lineages being repeatedly sampled over the years. While sexual lineages are predominant throughout France, asexual lineages are more prevalent in the south of the country, due to possible environmental or ecological factors that allow the overwintering of asexual forms.

In particular, reporter assays are crucial for mapping the oligomerization interfaces of transmembrane helices through scanning mutagenesis but their application is limited by the need to clone and measure each construct individually.

On this foundation we build a single-file Python toolkit, reactive_site_predictor.py, which ranks candidate reactive residues in both metallo- and apo-proteins.

A fixed global random seed removes all stochastic elements, guaranteeing reproducibility. Benchmarks on three representative assemblies (Rubisco, GroEL, and SecA) achieve top-10 recall between 90% and 50% for documented functional residues. While promising, the current validation is limited to three static PDB structures; extension to dynamic ensembles and explicit quantum layers is left to future work. The framework thus offers an interpretable, physics-grounded, and deterministic paradigm for protein-function prediction. Beyond residue-level reactivity, the same manifold-fiber formalism is ultimately intended for purely geometric analysis of protein-protein interfaces: instead of assigning scalar scores, we construct an explicit contact sub-manifold and study its curvature, topology, and fiber-overlap signatures to deduce interaction logic without additional learning. Benchmarks on sixteen diverse protein assemblies (three originals plus thirteen new targets) show top-10 recall between 50% and 100%, underscoring the framework's generality. Across the full benchmark of sixteen proteins, the method recovers 134 literature-supported residues among 160 top-rank predictions, corresponding to a global top-10 precision of 0.84.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Notably, when memorised content is spatially lateralised, the power of posterior alpha activity exhibits corresponding lateralisation during the retention interval, consistent with the retinotopic organisation of the visual cortex.

These findings position alpha oscillations as a promising target for neuromodulation.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that although alpha frequency is not typically lateralised in a retinotopic manner during working memory retention, such lateralisation can be externally induced. Using alpha closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS), and leveraging the phase-dependent responsiveness of alpha oscillations to sound, we successfully modulated alpha frequency asymmetrically between the visual cortices. The extent of induced frequency lateralisation was associated with the behavioural asymmetry in task performance.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Moreover, during embryonic development, HSCs migrate from the aorta-gonad mesonephros (AGM) to the fetal liver and finally to the bone marrow immediately after childbirth. Hence, the primary residence of adult HSCs in the bone marrow continues replenishing the hematopoietic lineage pool. In vivo, the HSC niche is significant and might be harnessed in regenerative medicine. HSCs in various niches have exhibited their respective tropism and proliferations based on the growth factors secreted by the niche. Accordingly, in this work, we hypothesized HSCs tropism towards cancer and stem cell niche of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2+, having a high relapse rate for possible cell therapy development. Our results indicate that HSC exclusive tropism towards breast cancer stem cells (CSC) and interaction with the cancer milieu lead to HSC differentiation into T-lymphocyte cells (CD4 & CD8). Moreover, the single-cell type proteomics of the migrated HSCs towards TNBC-CSCs and HER2+ cells indicated upregulation of IL-7 and Notch protein and several other upregulated proteins primarily involved in T cell activation and migration-related pathways. Likewise, the metabolomics from HSCs-derived conditioned media-treated CSCs, and HER2+ cells showed the capability of HSC-CM in arresting the growth and cell cycle of TNBC-CSC via altered mitochondrial bioenergetics. Hence, this study paves the way toward harnessing the potential of both HSCs and HSC-CM for personalized medicine against TNBC CSCs.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Using linear regression, we identified genomic regions where AR occupancy is associated with the expression level of ARA-elncRNA1. We further demonstrated that this eRNA recruits AR to YY1-mediated enhancer-promoter loops, stabilizing these interactions. A series of experiments, including RIP-qPCR, ChIP-qPCR, and EMSA, were conducted to validate the proposed model. Finally, we investigated the role of ARA-elncRNA1 in prostate cancer cells survival. Results We confirmed the sequence-specific interaction between AR and ARA-elncRNA1. This eRNA not only regulates AR occupancy at the promoters of several AR-dependent genes but also protects AR from proteasomal degradation. The AR:ARA-elncRNA1 complex interacts with YY1 and influences enhancer-promoter looping. Additionally, ARA-elncRNA1 was found to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vitro and expression level of lncRNA was associated with a lower Gleason score. Conclusions Our findings revealed the existence of an eRNA that directly binds to AR and regulates, in trans, the expression of several AR-dependent genes. We demonstrated that eRNAs can not only interact with AR but also modulate chromatin structure.

S.; Stocker, R.; van Vliet, S.; Ackermann, M.; Schubert, O. T.", "abstract": "Most microbes grow in spatially structured, genetically diverse communities where they interact metabolically with neighboring cells. In such settings, evolutionary processes can result in the loss of biosynthetic pathways, leading to dependencies among strains. The Black Queen Hypothesis suggests that these gene losses reduce metabolic burden, potentially conferring a fitness advantage. However, how these dependencies evolve at the level of individual cells remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an experimental system that enables direct observation of the first steps in the evolution of metabolic dependencies at single-cell resolution. Using a microfluidic setup combined with live-cell microscopy, we tracked the fate of individual amino acid auxotrophic mutant cells - deficient in methionine, tryptophan, or proline biosynthesis - within spatially structured Escherichia coli wildtype populations. When amino acids were externally supplied, auxotrophs grew faster than wildtype cells, Without external supply of amino acids, they grew significantly slower. When auxotrophs formed cell clusters, local depletion of amino acids further diminished their growth rates as well as the growth of neighbouring wildtype cells. Our mathematical model indicates that auxotroph growth is strongly constrained by the low rate of amino acid leakage from wildtype neighbors, conferring an advantage only once leakage surpasses a critical threshold. Overall, our findings show that the benefits of gene loss are highly context-dependent. Through single-cell experiments and modeling, we shed light on the early evolution of metabolic dependency and the trade-offs between reducing metabolic costs and maintaining metabolic autonomy in microbial communities.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

The recurrent EZH1Q571R mutation in follicular thyroid cancer suggests its involvement in tumor progression. Using EZH1 ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27me3 CUT&Tag, we demonstrated that EZH1 Q571R enhances chromatin binding and compaction and stimulates PRC2-EZH1 catalytic activity, leading to increased H3K27me3 levels and repression of tumor suppressor genes. Purified PRC2-EZH1 Q571R demonstrated a significant increase in histone methyltransferase activity compared to PRC2-EZH1 WT via enhanced nucleosome binding and DNA compaction. Notably, this effect is particularly prominent with EZH1 Q571R but only modestly seen with the corresponding EZH2 Q570R mutation, suggesting an EZH1-specific mechanism.

Gain-of-function mutations in human IMPDH2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and neuromuscular symptoms including dystonia, but the developmental mechanisms underlying these defects are unknown. We previously showed that these mutants are insensitive to GTP inhibition and hypothesized that their hyperactivity would affect nucleotide metabolism in vivo. Here, we characterize the metabolic and developmental consequences of the neurodevelopmental disorder- associated IMPDH2 mutant, S160del, in Xenopus tropicalis. We show that expressing S160del but not WT human IMPDH2 disrupts purine pools and somitogenesis in the developing tadpole. We also show that S160del disrupts in vivo IMPDH filament assembly, a well-described IMPDH regulatory mechanism. Cryo-EM structures show that S160del disrupts filament assembly by destabilizing the dimerization of regulatory Bateman domains. Dimerization of Bateman domains and subsequent filament formation can be restored with a high affinity ligand, but this does not restore sensitivity to GTP inhibition, suggesting S160del also disrupts allostery of IMPDH2 filaments.

Using this system, we built a dictionary of epithelial responses to 81 secreted niche factors at single cell resolution via donor-pooled, multiplexed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq).

Parts of the foreign DNA, called spacers, are incorporated into the CRISPR array which constitutes the immune memory. The orientation of CRISPR arrays is crucial for analyzing and understanding the functionality of CRISPR systems and their targets. Several methods have been developed to identify the orientation of a CRISPR array. To predict the orientation, different methods use different features such as the repeat sequences between the spacers, the location of the leader sequence, the Cas genes, or PAMs. However, those features are often not sufficient to predict the orientation with certainty, or different methods disagree. Remarkably, almost all CRISPR systems have been found to insert spacers in a polarized manner at the leader end of the array. We introduce CRISPR-evOr, a method that leverages the resulting patterns to predict the acquisition orientation for (a group of) CRISPR arrays by reconstructing and comparing the likelihood of their evolutionary history with respect to both possible acquisition orientations. The new method is independent of Cas type, leader existence and location, and transcription orientation. CRISPR-evOr is thus particularly useful for arrays that other CRISPR orientation tools cannot predict confidently and to verify or resolve conflicting predictions from existing tools. CRISPR-evOr currently confidently predicts the orientation of 28.3% of the arrays in the considered subset of CRISPRCasdb, which other tools like CRISPRDirection and CRISPRstrand cannot reliably orient. As our tool leverages evolutionary information we expect this percentage to grow in the future when more closely related arrays will be available.

Integration constitutes a general computational strategy that enables variable state estimation when direct observation of the variable is not possible, suggesting that it may play a critical role in other cognitive processes.

The Chronic Variable Stress (CVS) mouse model is a useful method for examining sex-specific susceptibility, as stress can be titrated in a sex-specific manner to produce depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours across both sexes. However, the sex-specific mechanisms regarding how CVS reorganizes brain anatomy remain unclear. Methods: Using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we provide the first whole-brain characterization of neuroanatomical changes induced by 6 or 28 days of exposure to CVS in female and male mice, respectively, and their association to behavior. We then examined the structural connectome underlying sex-specific latent dimensions of stress-susceptibility and potential molecular mechanisms using spatial gene expression analyses. Results: CVS induced significant neuroanatomical changes in regions already implicated in depression in both sexes (e.g. nucleus accumbens and hippocampus) as well as female- and male-specific neuroanatomical changes. In females, these changes were associated with both depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. While in males, we identified two orthogonal dimensions of neuroanatomical changes associated with anxiety-like behavior or social preference. These latent dimensions are associated with sex-specific hub regions and, in females, were associated with genes enriched for protein localization to the cell surface. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that different durations of CVS result in similar neuroanatomical changes in both sexes, however the direction of change and association to behavior is sex-specific. In females, these changes may be attributed to alterations in synaptic connectivity.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we simulated the acoustic challenges of multi-talker listening and found that adults over 50 years old (N = 76) recognized speech more slowly, less accurately, and less consistently than younger adults (N = 107). While peripheral hearing status accounted for average differences in speech intelligibility by age, it did not account for moment-to-moment variability in speed and accuracy - fluctuations central to the frustration experienced by older listeners in challenging environments. We hypothesized that age-related changes in brain arousal systems might account for the fluctuant 'noise' in speech processing observed in older listeners. To isolate the contribution of arousal state independent of hearing status and cognitive load, we measured the pre-stimulus pupil-indexed arousal state (PPAS) immediately prior to speech onset. Older - but not younger - adults exhibited a striking inverted-U relationship between PPAS and speech recognition accuracy. Notably, pupil-indexed listening effort measured seconds later during speech encoding was not associated with trial-to-trial performance. Moreover, older adults exhibited altered arousal regulation, occupying a lower PPAS extremum not observed in younger listeners that was specifically associated with performance deficits and subjective listening difficulties reported in hearing health questionnaires. These findings show that age-related changes in central arousal states interact with peripheral hearing status to offer a more complete explanation for why older adults find speech processing in social setting so challenging.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Progressive disruption of Ca2+-binding by the C2D-domain in mice increasingly altered synaptic sound encoding and eliminated the Ca2+-cooperativity of SV-exocytosis, indicating that this Ca2+-cooperativity reflects binding of several Ca2+-ions to otoferlin.

Modeling approaches to these tasks overwhelmingly assume that participants make choices based on explicitly comparing the values of the presented options.

We confirmed this result in a large (1000 participant) dataset with multiple converging lines of evidence comparing both model fits and model generative performance. Value-comparison models were restricted to a reduced area of the potential space of single-trial outcome-dependent behavior, demonstrating an intrinsic limitation in the ability to reproduce strategy diversity. Furthermore, we found that using even the best-fit value-comparison model led to a substantial, systematic bias and a compression of individual differences in reconstructed behavior compared to the foraging-based model, leading to weaker predictions of behavioral health measures. Our results imply that studies using value-comparison models to link behavior with neural activity or psychiatric symptoms may be less sensitive to individual differences than a simple alternative based on ethological foraging.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify integrin 3{beta}1, composed of ITGA3 and ITGB1 subunits, as a sialylated glycoprotein ligand for Siglec-10, an inhibitory receptor on TAMs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Mechanistically, the interaction between Siglec-10 on TAMs and 3{beta}1 on PDAC cells suppresses macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, enabling immune evasion by PDAC. Consequently, disrupting Siglec-10 interactions with monoclonal antibodies significantly enhances macrophage phagocytosis of PDAC cells in vitro. In a PDAC xenograft mouse model engrafted with human macrophages, disrupting Siglec-10 interactions reduces tumor growth and activates the PI3K/MAPK/AP-1 signaling cascades in macrophages, enhancing their phagocytic capacity.

According to the extreme value theory, the probability of extreme events can be approximated using generalized Pareto distributions. In this study, non-stationary generalized Pareto distributions were used to estimate the changing risk of low crop yield. The proposed methods were applied to global yield data for maize, wheat, rice, and soybean collected from 1961 to 2022, as well as local yield data for wheat, rice, and soybean in Japan, from a start date of either 1948 or 1958 and running to 2020. The results illustrated exacerbated trends of low-yield risk in maize crops in Africa; maize, wheat, and rice in Americas; maize and wheat in Western, Central, and Southern Asia; maize and wheat in Europe; and soybean in Japan. Only wheat in Japan showed trends of mitigating the risk of low yields. The proposed models were also validated through simulations. The results showed that the models can generally estimate the changing risks accurately, and the precision depends on the size of the data set. Although there is still room for improvement in the models, the present study demonstrates that it is possible to estimate changes in the risk of low yield using a data-driven approach based on extreme value theory without assumptions about climate and crop physiology.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

M.; Schuller, J.", "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) assembly is a stepwise process in which intermediate complexes with auxiliary proteins are transiently formed to allow efficient de novo biogenesis or repair of damaged PSII. In particular, the role of extrinsic PSII subunits (PsbO, PsbU, PsbV) and auxiliary proteins such as Psb27 for the formation and photoactivation of the Mn4O5Ca cluster, which catalyzes the unique water splitting reaction in mature PSII, remains unclear. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined the structure of two novel late-stage PSII assembly intermediates. In contrast to previous studies, the resulting monomeric PSII complexes contain both PsbJ and Psb27 and exhibit a fully mature acceptor side, while the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) is still in an immature state. The second complex additionally associates with the late-acting assembly factor Psb32 and the extrinsic subunit PsbV. While Psb32 has received little attention, its proposed role in the complex challenges the previous assumption that all extrinsic subunits associate spontaneously, as well as the notion that PsbO initiates binding and solely drives OEC formation. Our structures of the Psb27-PSII and Psb32-PSII intermediates provide novel insights, how structural changes of C-termini of the D1 and D2 core proteins regulate maturation of the OEC and how the catalytic side is prepared for binding of the Mn4O5Ca cluster. The Psb32-PSII complex potentially represents the final PSII assembly intermediate that precede the incorporation and photoactivation of the Mn4O5Ca cluster, allowing us to explain the final steps in the PSII biogenesis and assembly pipeline in great detail, as only the two extrinsic subunits PsbO and PsbU are missing.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Subsequent validation and testing can be performed through pot, greenhouse, and field trials. The system can efficiently function as a high-throughput screening tool for assessing plant-microbiome interactions and their associated metabolic signatures. Our phytobiome culturing technique harnesses root exudation from live plants, capitalizing on the membrane's selective separation to prevent direct physical interaction between plant and microbiome components. Consequently, the interaction is solely through chemical-mediated signalling. By employing this method, we can intricately dissect complex plant-microbiome interactions while faithfully maintaining and emulating the contact independent inherent associations prevalent within these phytobiomes.

Previous studies of water deficit and heat stress combination were primarily conducted under controlled growth conditions, revealing that the combination of water deficit and heat stress resulted in the activation of unique stress responses and acclimation pathways. However, whether similar responses to stress combination occur in the field remained largely unknown. Here we report on a two-year field study in which the transcriptomic and physiological responses of vegetative and reproductive tissues of soybean (Glycine max) to water deficit, heat treatment and their combination were studied. Our findings reveal that the transcriptomic responses of soybeans grown in the field are different from those grown under controlled growth chamber conditions. These differences were especially noticeable in plants subjected to the heat or water deficit treatments, and less in plants subjected to the stress combination. In addition, we report that differential transpiration between leaves and pods, that was originally discovered in plants grown under controlled growth conditions, occurs in field grown soybeans in response to heat stress, as well as heat stress combined with water deficit.

They may rely on 2D images that suffer from occlusion, use expensive sensing technologies like X-ray computed tomography, or depend on 3D modeling approaches with assumptions about branching that make them difficult to generalize. To address these challenges, we introduce an open-source Python framework for quantifying RSA samples from 3D point clouds generated from low-cost photogrammetry. Critically, this method incorporates no assumptions about taxon-specific branching orientation, making it both well-suited for modeling naturally grown annual dicots such as soybean and generalizable across species. Using field-grown soybean as a test case, we demonstrate the utility of this framework to extract biologically meaningful 3D features of divergent root systems sampled across developmental stages and soil environments, and enable new analyses not possible with 2D approaches, such as modeling metabolic scaling relationships. Results indicate that, in our soybean samples, while certain individual features like taproot tortuosity are potentially influenced by the soil environment, and while roots in sandy loam exhibited greater feature plasticity, fundamental scaling properties remain consistent.

Here we demonstrate that the bivalent epigenetic regulator ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) is both necessary and sufficient to promote flowering. We identify ULT1 as a novel component of the autonomous pathway (AP) and show that it accelerates flowering by directly repressing FLC transcription. We demonstrate that ULT1 physically associates with the SWINGER (SWN) and CURLY LEAF (CLF) histone methyltransferase components of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to regulate FLC transcription by altering the accumulation of H3K27me3 marks.

Understanding these local microenvironments requires precise spatio-temporal information on gene expression profiles, which current technology cannot achieve. Here we investigate transcriptional changes during barley development, from the specification of meristem and organ founder cells to the initiation of distinct floral organs, based on an imputation approach integrating deep single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial gene expression data. The expression profiles of more than 40.000 genes can be analysed at cellular resolution in multiple barley tissues using the web-based graphical interface BARVISTA, which enables precise virtual microdissection to analyse any sub-ensemble of cells.

In contrast, PSII is more susceptible to photoinhibition under stress but has an efficient repair system. Consequently, PSII photoinhibition is considered a protective mechanism that mitigates PSI over-reduction. However, this photoprotective role under environmental stress remains unexplored in intact plants without using mutants or chemical treatments. To address this, we examined the relationship between PSII photoinhibition and susceptibility to PSI photoinhibition under two representative stresses that selectively induce PSI photoinhibition: chilling stress and fluctuating light, using A. thaliana and cucumber. Under chilling stress, A. thaliana exhibited marked PSII photoinhibition and maintained active PSI, whereas cucumber showed insufficient PSII downregulation and suffered PSI photoinhibition. In addition, when fluctuating light treatment was applied to plants with various Fv/Fm (the maximum quantum yield of PSII), plants with reduced Fv/Fm maintained oxidized PSI, and PSI photoinhibition progressed slowly. The susceptibility to PSI photoinhibition under fluctuating light strongly correlated with Fv/Fm, providing clear evidence that PSII photoinhibition protects PSI in vivo. Interestingly, even in plants where P700 remained oxidized during saturation pulses due to PSII photoinhibition, the iron-sulfur clusters (Fe-S clusters) remained reduced. However, the re-oxidation rate of reduced Fe-S clusters was enhanced in PSII-photoinhibited plants, suggesting that charge recombination to P700+ with reduced components on the acceptor side would suppress ROS generation downstream of PSI. This study clarifies how PSII photoinhibition suppresses PSI photoinhibition and prevents ROS-induced damage in wild-type plants under environmental stress.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Euglena gracilis, a flagellate with a secondary green plastid, represents a distantly related lineage whose light-harvesting regulation remains poorly understood. Although spectral shifts under different light regimes have been observed, their molecular basis was unknown. Here, through integrated phylogenomic, proteomic, structural, and spectroscopic analyses, we identify a novel chlorophyll a far-red-absorbing antenna complex in E. gracilis, composed of a species-specific Lhce protein family. This antenna forms a pentameric complex under low light and transiently associates with PSII during far-red light exposure. It is structurally and functionally distinct from canonical LHCII trimers and absent in Viridiplantae. Additionally, PSI in E. gracilis is surrounded by an expanded Lhce/LhcbM belt around a minimal core.

Root cell elongation is precisely regulated by the phytohormone auxin, which has long been known to inhibit this process. The molecular pathways through which auxin influences cell wall modifications remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore the transcriptional regulation of cell wall-related genes by auxin in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. The nuclear auxin pathway altered the expression of numerous cell-wall related genes, suggesting dynamic modification of the cell wall during root cell elongation. We identified novel root-specific polygalacturonases (PGs), enzymes involved in pectin degradation, which we termed POLYGALACTURONASES REGULATED BY AUXIN (PGRAs). PGRAs are expressed specifically in the root epidermis, beginning at the elongation zone. Our results demonstrate that induction of PGRA1 expression initially promotes root cell elongation, while long term overexpression inhibits root growth. Auxin downregulates PGRA1 in the elongation zone, and plants lacking PGRAs fail to increase root growth rate in response to reduced auxin levels. This suggests that auxin downregulates PGRA expression to prevent PGRA-mediated pectin remodeling, thereby contributing to inhibition of root cell elongation. We established a novel link between auxin signaling and pectin modifications in the control of cell growth.

R.", "abstract": "Objectives: Machine perfusion of organs outside of the body is a growing area of research with significant applications in the fields of organ preservation and transplantation, but more widely it offers a new approach to study disease processes and to evaluate new therapeutics and devices. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) allows for non-invasive assessment of organ structure and function, enabling quantitative measurement of tissue perfusion and microstructure. In this study, we demonstrate that MR imaging sequences can be obtained from machine-perfused porcine livers using a modified perfusion rig for MR compatibility and highlight the quantitative measures that can be obtained through this methodology. Materials and Methods: 7 porcine livers were retrieved fresh from the abattoir using a previously published protocol and following transport in cold preservative underwent perfusion with oxygenated autologous blood inside a 3T clinical MRI scanner using a custom modified perfusion rig. Multiple MR imaging sequences were acquired: T2-weighted imaging, Diffusion Weighted Imaging and Dynamic Contrast Enhanced imaging following injection of Gadolinium dye into the portal vein and hepatic artery. Histological analysis was performed to assess preservation injury to the liver. Control samples for histology were obtained from livers with similar preservation periods but preserved in standard cold storage on ice (Static Cold Storage). Results: Concurrent MR imaging and machine perfusion were successfully performed, allowing dynamic measurement of tissue perfusion to be obtained in ex vivo livers, including calculation of gadolinium contrast enhancement curves and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient maps. Segmentation of vessels down to a radius of 0.45mm allowed detailed morphological analysis of the vascular network, including extraction of clinically relevant parameters such as vessel tortuosity. Histological evaluation showed better preservation of the hepatic acinar structure in perfused than non-perfused livers. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that MR imaging of machine-perfused organs enables high-resolution quantitative evaluation of whole-organ vascular morphology and flow dynamics. This platform provides opportunities to study vascular pathology in diseased human organs and evaluate novel therapeutic interventions, with particular relevance for drug-delivery strategies.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Recent imported cases to Europe and North America have raised concerns about the potential for local transmission in non-endemic areas. To assess this risk in the United Kingdom, we investigated the vector competence of Culex pipiens molestus (Cx. molestus), a human-biting mosquito common in urban environments. Laboratory-reared adult females were fed a bloodmeal containing a Cuban 2024 OROV outbreak strain (240023) and maintained at 27{degrees}C. Of 64 individuals tested at 12-14 days post-infection via plaque assay, none were positive for OROV in bodies, indicating no evidence of infection and subsequently limited or no vector competence potential. These results provide evidence that UK populations of Cx. molestus are unlikely to support OROV transmission, thereby refining assessments of OROV emergence risk in temperate settings. Further studies are needed to test other putative UK mosquito vectors, as well as Culicoides biting midge species to fully assess the potential for OROV transmission in this region.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

We combined a hierarchical gambling task with cross-sectional administration of psychometric surveys and computational cognitive modeling, to assess whether this preference extends to contexts in which decision outcomes benefit others, specifically charitable organizations. In neurotypical individuals (n=100), there was a dramatic reduction in the preference for free choice across self- and charity-benefiting gambling contexts when freely chosen options yielded divergent outcome distributions - i.e., when free choice afforded control over decision outcomes. This selective modulation is consistent with a cost-benefit analysis, trading cognitive effort and controllability gains against the utilities of earning money for oneself vs. for a charity. When the same task was administered to individuals with self-reported obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n=108) the preference for control over decision outcomes was preserved across self- and charity-benefiting contexts, consistent with a responsibility-OCD subtype and with an excessive subjective utility of control more generally.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

To uncover the genetic factors underlying this behavior, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in kennel-housed beagle dogs. Our analysis identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 5 of the KCNQ3 gene on chromosome 13 associated with freezing behavior in response to unfamiliar environments and people. To validate this finding, we used a zebrafish model, where CRISPR/Cas9-induced kcnq3 deficiencies led to heightened fear and arousal in two behavioral tests. KCNQ3 is implicated in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, and our results highlight its evolutionarily conserved role in modulating fear responses. In dogs, an enriched environment can mitigate the adverse effects of KCNQ3 deficiency by reducing threat perception, highlighting the role of gene-environment interactions in shaping behavioral responses.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

We conducted a large-scale genome-resolved metagenomic analysis of 624 stool samples from 11 cohorts spanning five cancer types from three continents to identify conserved microbial biomarkers of immunotherapy response. Responders (R; n = 362) exhibited enrichment of Blautia species, linked to acetate production from CO2 via the Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, glycoside hydrolases (GH), and amino acid biosynthesis. Non-responders (NR; n = 262) showed increased oral (e.g. Veillonella parvula, Dialister invisus) and food-derived taxa included opportunistic species e.g. Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella spp., alongside depletion of gut-resident microbes and enriched lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and flagellar assembly pathways. Interestingly, part of NR-associated microbes originated from non-intestinal niches (oral/food), which may correlate with reduced gut microbial load in the large intestine. These findings redefine dietary interventions as dual-edged: while carbon sources such as fiber processed by GH or CO2 processed by WL pathway supports beneficial taxa and immune system, pathogen-free food sourcing is critical to avoid introducing opportunistic microbes. Our work establishes the resident-to-transient microbial ratio as a novel predictive biomarker and positions Blautia as a keystone genus for next-generation probiotics targeting carbon metabolism-immune crosstalk. By integrating taxonomic, functional, and ecological axes, this study provides a roadmap for microbiome-guided precision nutrition to optimize immunotherapy outcomes. While immunotherapy non-responders exhibit gut microbiota enriched with food/oral commensals, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii - shows context-dependent associations, with strain-level variations potentially linked to A blood group antigen N-acetylgalactosamine utilization, highlighting its role as a conditional biomarker and the prognostic value of metagenomics in personalized therapy.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

The spindle provides the machinery for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Mammalian oocytes lack centrioles and, therefore, the meiotic spindle relies on the organization of numerous acentriolar microtubule organizing centers into two poles (polar MTOCs, pMTOCs). The traditional view is that, in mammalian oocytes, microtubules are the sole cytoskeletal component responsible for regulating pMTOC organization and spindle assembly. We identified a novel F-actin pool that surrounds pMTOCs, forming F-actin cage-like structure. We demonstrated that F-actin localization on the spindle depends on unconventional myosins X and VIIb. Selective disruption of spindle-localized F-actin, using myosin X/VIIb knockdown oocytes or photoswitchable Optojasp-1, perturbed pMTOC organization, leading to unfocused spindle poles and chromosome missegregation.

L.-s.; Kwan, T.-K.; Huang, D.; Huang, J.; Wang, X.; Lui, G. C.; Ma, S.-L.; Leung, K.-S.", "abstract": "A rapid method to triage febrile patients into different categories of etiologies remains a significant challenge even nowadays, when many molecular tests for pathogens are available. Routine serum protein tests like C-reactive protein and procalcitonin have limited specificity. Host response gene signatures are promising biomarkers but they usually require assaying many genes, e.g. 7 genes are commonly used to calculate the interferon (IFN) score. However, these gene panels fail to capture cell-type-specific host responses. Measuring gene expression of a specified single cell population, like monocytes, offers enhanced biological insight. However, it currently requires laborious cell sorting or costly single-cell sequencing techniques, limiting its clinical applicability. This study aims to develop a simple ratio-based biomarker (RBB) representing monocyte-specific host response to viral infection called DIRECT LS-TA method. A simple ratio of 2 genes (both are shortlist monocyte informative genes) quantified in peripheral blood (PB) samples correlated with gene expression in purified monocytes in the corresponding individual. These RBBs cover 3 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs): IFI27/PSAP, IFI44L/PSAP and SIGLEC1/PSAP. They are compared to the conventional multi-gene IFN score in the differentiation of viral infection. Public gene expression datasets from NCBI GEO were used to shortlist monocyte-informative genes that can be used as the RBB in PB. The DIRECT LS-TA RBB was calculated as the ratio of the target ISG transcript abundance (TA) to that of another reference gene (PSAP or CTSS) directly quantified from bulk PB data (e.g., Log(IFI27/PSAP) in WB). The correlation (expressed by coefficient of determination, R2) between these DIRECT LS-TA RBBs and the gold-standard target gene TA measured in purified monocytes was assessed. The diagnostic performance of selected RBBs (IFI27/PSAP, IFI44L/PSAP, SIGLEC1/PSAP) was compared against the conventional 8-gene IFN score for differentiating viral infections from controls. Direct LS-TA RBBs measured in PB showed strong correlation with gold-standard gene expression measured in purified monocytes (R2 ranged from 0.53 for the target gene IFI27 to >0.9 for the target gene IFI44L). This high level of correlation supports that this simple RBB (DIRECT LS-TA) method can replace the tedious cell sorting approach to obtain single-cell-type gene expression data. All DIRECT LS-TA results of ISGs were raised during viral infection. The best clinical performance in triaging viral infection patients was achieved by IFI27/PSAP or IFI27/CTSS across all datasets. For example, in the GSE111368 dataset, IFI27/PSAP achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97) with 88% sensitivity and 95% specificity, surpassing the IFN score's AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.85-0.94) with 79% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Conclusion: The DIRECT LS-TA method, utilizing the format of simple two-gene ratio-based biomarkers like IFI27/PSAP, provides a robust and accurate measure of monocyte-specific interferon pathway activation directly from peripheral blood. The superior performance of the DIRECT LS-TA method makes it a promising, readily implementable tool for clinical triage. Its ability to provide single-cell-type specific information, rapid turnaround using standard qPCR/dPCR technology, and enhanced biological specificity make it a valuable molecular host response assessment.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

In viticulture and winemaking, the resulting distinct microbial biogeographic patterns influence wine characteristics - a well-established concept termed microbial terroir. Yet, due to the complexity of interactions, the specific environmental drivers shaping these microbiomes remain poorly understood. We conducted a multi-year, large-scale survey (N = 680 samples) of Swiss vineyards (N = 95 sites), following a subset (N = 12, within 2.46 km) longitudinally over 3 years. We integrate microbiome (bacterial and fungal marker-gene sequencing), untargeted metabolomics (GC-MS and LC-MS/MS), environmental monitoring, and sensory data to disentangle abiotic factors influencing community assembly and interactions in vineyards and in wine fermentations. Results show that topography and climate collectively structure microbial communities, yet exhibit distinct influences on soil- and plant-associated microbiomes. Berry-associated fungal communities exhibit the strongest site-specific imprint, enabling machine-learning-based prediction of even subtle microclimatic differences. Climatic factors and berry chemistry exhibit an inverse relationship, selectively favoring either Hanseniaspora sp. or Saccharomyces cerevisiae - each correlating with distinct metabolite and aroma profiles. Additionally, plant stress-response metabolites were associated with shifts in microbial composition and fermentation outcomes. By integrating multi-omics and machine learning approaches, this study enhances our understanding of microbial biogeography and its role in winegrowing. Our findings highlight the need for further research on microbial transmission, vineyard management, and implications for wine quality, offering a foundation for a more precise, science-driven approach to terroir expression.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Canada and the United States of America (USA) share a long international border, and thus, there is a need and opportunity to develop transboundary connectivity plans for this international region. We extended a previously published pan-Canadian multi-species connectivity model into the USA to produce a seamless and high-resolution omnidirectional connectivity map for the two countries. We identify several significant animal movement corridors across the transboundary region and show that about 20% of connectivity hotspots in the region are covered by protected areas.

Thus, FGF2 stimulates different responses at high and low concentrations, while FGF4 gradients are critical, e.g., in limb development., but it is not known if responses to FGF4 differ in a concentration-dependent manner. Employing rat mammary (Rama) 27 fibroblasts, we therefore measured the FGF4 concentration- and time-dependence of the simulation of phosphorylation of FRS2, MAPK1 and MAPK3 which are downstream of the FGF receptor (FGFR1c). At 10 pg/mL FGF4 caused a very weak phosphorylation of FRS2 at Y435 and Y196 and a stronger one of MAPK1 and MAPK3 that oscillated with maximum levels after 30 min and 240 min stimulation. The phosphorylation of these proteins at 1 ng/mL FGF4 was considerably stronger and showed a similar oscillation. At 10 ng/mL FGF4, the phosphorylation of FRS2 reached an early peak after 5 min, declined at 15 min and then rose again at 30 min before declining to the end of the time-course at 240 min, whereas the phosphorylation of MAPK1 and MAPK3 was strong after 5 minutes, reached a maximum after 30 minutes and then declined gradually. At 1 g/mL and 3 g/mL FGF4 after 15 min and 60 min the phosphorylation of FRS2, MAPK1 and MAPK3 was much lower at 60 min compared to that observed at lower concentrations of FGF4. The data indicate that at low concentrations FGF4 elicits an oscillatory response at the level of phosphorylation of FRS2 and of MAPK1 and MAPK3, whereas a bell-shaped dose response may occur at the highest concentrations of FGF4. The addition of exogenous heparin, an effective mimic of endogenous heparan sulfate, suggests that there may be an influence of the interaction of FGF4 with pericellular matrix and the dose-and time-dependence of the phosphorylation of FRS2 and MAPK1 and MAPK3.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Targeted modulation of these interfaces could, therefore, serve as an effective strategy for engineering condensates and modifying aberrant behaviors. However, the molecular grammar driving the preferential localization of molecules at condensate interfaces remains largely unknown. In this study, we developed a computational pipeline that combines high-throughput coarse-grained simulations, machine learning, and mixed-integer linear programming to design peptides that selectively partition at the interfaces of specific condensate targets. Using this workflow, we designed and synthesized peptides that localize at the interface of three distinct condensates formed by different intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs). These peptides exhibit surfactant-like architectures, with one tail incorporated into the condensate and the other excluded from the dense phase. In all cases, the tail entering the condensates is enriched in aromatic residues, while the sequence of the excluded tail varies among the IDRs. For hnRNPA1- and LAF1- IDRs, the excluded tail is enriched in lysines and matches the net charge of the condensate-forming protein, promoting electrostatic repulsion. In the case of DDX4-IDR, which exhibits the lowest charge density, the excluded tail mainly consists of uncharged valine residues, which exhibit negligible interactions with the scaffold protein. These results highlight the importance of the net charge of the scaffold as a key physicochemical parameter for designing peptides with preferential interfacial localization. Overall, our pipeline represents a promising strategy for the rational design of interface-localizing peptides and the identification of the corresponding molecular grammar.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, the advanced algorithms required for multi-omics integration typically demand programming skills and statistical background, restricting their use to specialized users. To advance towards resolving these challenges, we present TurbOmics, a user-friendly web-based platform that enables researchers with diverse backgrounds to analyze metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics data using advanced algorithms for multi-omics integration, while addressing key challenges associated with metabolomics data. Users can upload quantitative data and include additional information, such as metabolite identification or lipid classes, that streamline the interpretation of complex results. TurbOmics can be used sequentially with our previously published tool, TurboPutative, to simplify, reduce and prioritize the list of putative annotations from untargeted metabolomics datasets. Thanks to its flexible and interactive interface, researchers can perform exploratory data analysis and multi-omics integration using the Multi-Omics Factor Analysis, Pathway Integrative Analysis and Enrichment Analysis modules.

T.; Frees, D.; Kjos, M.", "abstract": "Regulated protein degradation by Clp proteases is a highly conserved post-translational control mechanism in bacteria. In Staphylococcus aureus, the ClpXP complex targets the peptidoglycan hydrolase Sle1, maintaining a tightly regulated balance between peptidoglycan biosynthesis and hydrolysis, which is required to ensure proper cell splitting without compromising cell integrity. {beta}-lactams antibiotics disturb this balance, leading to their bactericidal effects. The mechanism underlying the specific targeting of Sle1 by the conserved ClpXP complex remains unknown. From a genome-wide screen for determinants of penicillin G susceptibility in S. aureus, we here identify the uncharacterized protein CxaR (for ClpXP-associated autolytic regulator). Growth defects, premature cell splitting, and increased cell lysis were observed in the absence of CxaR. Interestingly, these defects were mitigated by sublethal concentrations of {beta}-lactams. Through sequencing cxaR suppressor mutants, followed by immunoblotting, we show that the cxaR phenotypes are caused by excessive Sle1 accumulation. Indeed, exposure to {beta}-lactams reduces Sle1 levels, thereby rescuing the cells lacking CxaR. Furthermore, in vivo protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that CxaR directly interacts with both ClpXP and Sle1, whereas no direct interaction was detected between Sle1 and ClpX. In line with this, CxaR was found to co-localize with ClpX in septal-adjacent foci by fluorescence microscopy. Taken together, these findings reveal that CxaR is a new regulatory factor controlling staphylococcal cell splitting by acting as an adaptor protein for controlled ClpXP-mediated degradation of Sle1.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Defects in processing G4 structures are associated with replication stress, a common property of both B cell cancers and hyperproliferative premalignant cells. Genome instability arising from replication stress is a hallmark of cancer and strongly contributes to the chromosome rearrangements in B cell cancers. Here, we define the impact of G4-stabilizing ligands on generating genome instability in primary and malignant B cells. Treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin (PDS) causes breaks and chromosome rearrangements at ribosomal DNA and pericentromeric major satellite regions in both mouse primary B cell culture and CH12 lymphoma cells. PDS also causes extensive pericentromeric DNA damage in immortalized human B cell lines. Remarkably, PDS causes high level of tetraploid metaphase cells correlated with high level of dicentric chromosomes specifically in primary but not in CH12 B cells. Unlike primary B cells, CH12 cells undergo checkpoint activation and strong G2/M arrest in response to PDS treatment thus preventing tetraploid appearance. Altogether, these results highlight the difference between primary and malignant B cells in response to PDS, revealing the therapeutic potential of G4-stabilizing drugs to selectively suppress tumor cell growth and proliferation.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

We sought to define the genetic interplay of 53BP1 with C-NHEJ, focusing on the DNA-PKcs kinase. We examined Cas9 DSBs, which largely generates blunt DSBs, since blunt DSB EJ is dependent on C-NHEJ. Loss of 53BP1 does not affect blunt DSB EJ, but causes a reduction in such repair in DNA-PKcs deficient cells. In contrast, disrupting 53BP1 and DNA-PKcs, both alone and together, has similar effects on the type of deletion mutation (increase in microhomology deletions). We found similar effects on EJ with RIF1 loss, which is a downstream effector of 53BP1. Thus, 53BP1/RIF1 appear to play a backup role for DNA-PKcs during blunt DSB EJ, but function in the same pathway to suppress microhomology deletions. In contrast, 53BP1 and DNA-PKcs function independently to suppress homology-directed repair. Finally, DNA-PKcs kinase inhibition causes marked radiosensitivity, which is not additive with loss of 53BP1 and RIF1.

Successful implementation of this strategy has been elusive and likely requires a more complete understanding of the microenvironment of the developing ovarian follicles, including ovarian oxygen concentrations. The oxygen tension within the reproductive tract plays a crucial role in follicular development and oocyte maturation. While in vitro culture systems often use atmospheric oxygen (21%), the native environment in vivo is significantly lower, ranging from 1.5% to 8.7%. This study aimed to investigate the effects of reduced oxygen tensions (3% and 5%) on follicle survival, growth, antrum formation, and hormone production in cultured secondary follicles from rhesus macaques (macaca mulata). A total of 300 follicles were isolated from 7 animals and cultured under three oxygen conditions: 3%, 5%, and 21% O2. Follicle survival and antrum formation were assessed weekly by microscopy and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, while growth dynamics and hormone levels (estradiol, progesterone, AMH, and inhibin B) were monitored throughout the culture period. Results demonstrated that follicles cultured at 3% and 5% oxygen exhibited significantly higher survival rates and antrum formation compared to those cultured at 21% O2. No significant differences in survival were observed between the 3% and 5% oxygen groups. Growth dynamics revealed distinct patterns, with both low oxygen groups promoting more robust and sustained follicle growth, while atmospheric oxygen led to rapid degeneration. Hormonal analysis showed that follicles in 21% O2 had elevated early hormone production but exhibited reduced long-term viability. In contrast, 3% and 5% oxygen delayed hormone production, reflecting a more stable and sustained follicular environment. These findings underscore the importance of low oxygen tensions in mimicking the physiological conditions of the reproductive tract, improving follicular development, and supporting optimal hormonal function in vitro. This study suggests that further reducing oxygen levels to 3% may offer additional advantages for long-term follicle viability and function in reproductive technologies.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Host immune response can regulate microbial community richness and abundance, which in turn can shape the prevalence of different ecological interactions within the microbiome. Theory predicts that host immune states shift dominant interaction modes among microbes: inflammation favors competition, while immunosuppression favors mutualism. We test these theoretical predictions using the stomach cancer microbiome data through integrated genomic and metabolic analyses. We observe that tumors with high-richness and high-abundance microbiomes were associated with increased mutualistic interactions, whereas tumors with low-richness and low-abundance microbiomes had fewer mutualistic interactions. Host immune gene expression in the high-richness and abundance group was suggestive of a dysregulated or immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment, whereas in the low-richness and abundance group immune signatures were indicative of intact immune function. Notably, competitive interactions remained relatively consistent between groups, whereas mutualism varied markedly, highlighting its sensitivity to shifts in immune state. Finally, the microbiome and host immune states were linked to patient clinical outcomes, with high-richness and abundance microbiomes associated with poorer survival and elevated expression of immune markers linked to adverse prognosis.

In eukaryotes, canonical histones form octamers that wrap ~147 base pairs of DNA into nucleosomes - the fundamental units of chromatin. In archaea, histones form dimers that further multimerize into extended hypernucleosomes along DNA. Although bacteria were long thought to lack histones, recent studies have uncovered histone homologs in diverse bacterial lineages, many of which possess key DNA-binding features. We previously characterized HBb, a bacterial histone from Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, which binds DNA as a dimer and induces bending. Here, we describe HLp from Leptospira perolatii, a representative of a distinct bacterial histone group. Crystallographic and biophysical analyses reveal that HLp forms stable tetramers. Like HBb, HLp binds DNA non-specifically; however, it adopts a different mode of interaction - wrapping ~60 base pairs of DNA around its tetrameric core. This wrapping mode, supported by molecular dynamics simulations and DNA-binding assays, promotes DNA compaction and alters its topology. When expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli, HLp reorganizes nucleoid morphology, consistent with a role in chromatin organization.

Restriction of cell spread area or environmental stiffness both inhibit YAP activation and nuclear translocation. The Arp2/3 complex plays a critical role in polymerization of branched actin networks that drive cell spreading, protrusion, and migration. While YAP activation has been closely linked to cellular spreading, the specific role of actin branching in force buildup and YAP activation is unclear. To assess the role of actin branching in this process, we measured cell spreading, YAP nuclear translocation, force on the adhesion adaptor protein Talin (FRET tension sensor), and extracellular forces (traction force microscopy, TFM) in 3T3 cells with and without inhibition of actin branching. The results indicate that YAP activation still occurs when actin branching and cell spreading is reduced. Interestingly, while actin de-branching resulted in decreased force on talin, relatively little change in average traction stress was observed, highlighting the distinct difference between molecular level and cellular level force regulation of YAP. While cell spreading is a driver of YAP nuclear translocation, this is likely through indirect effects. Changes in cell spreading induced by actin branching inhibition do not significantly perturb YAP activation.

Ec78 distinguishes itself from other retrons by leveraging the Septu defense system, a stand-alone ATPase-nuclease pair (PtuAB), by reshaping its phage sensing and molecular assembly processes. To elucidate the evolutionary adaptation of PtuAB by Ec78, we determined electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) structures of Ec78 as well as the retron-displaced PtuAB at near atomic resolutions. We show that the Ec78-associated ATPase, PtuA, acquired unique elements that enable its interactions with the reverse transcriptase and the msDNA, as well as self-assembly when displaced by the retron.

Knowing kinesin-1 can be regulated via autoinhibition, does kinesin-1 exhibit autoinhibition on cargo, and could this regulate vesicular transport through 3D MT intersections in vitro? To answer this question, we compared liposome transport by ~10 nearly full-length kinesin-1 motors with KLC bound (Kin{Delta}C) versus constitutively active control (K543). In 3D MT intersections, Kin{Delta}C-liposomes terminate (48%), go straight (43%), but rarely turn (9%), starkly contrasting K543-liposomes which go straight (57%), turn (31%), but rarely terminate (12%). On single MTs, Kin{Delta}C-liposomes have reduced run lengths and detachment forces versus K543-liposomes, suggesting autoinhibition reduces MT engagement, as supported by 3-fold lower Kin{Delta}C MT landing rates versus K543, and mechanistic in silico modeling. Furthermore, kinesore, a small molecule that overcomes kinesin-1 autoinhibition, restores Kin{Delta}Cs MT engagement. Thus, we propose that partial kinesin-1 autoinhibition while cargo-bound may fine-tune cargo delivery to support physiological demands.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

A big change in the spinal cord injury (SCI) microenvironment is the elevated level of glucocorticoids. In this study, we examined the impact of glucocorticoids on endogenous NSPCs in the adult mouse spinal cord. Our findings reveal that adult spinal cord NSPCs express glucocorticoid receptors, but not mineralocorticoid receptors. Glucocorticoids were found to significantly inhibit the proliferation and neurosphere formation of NSPCs via activation of glucocorticoid receptors, and they also impaired their differentiation. Importantly, the glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor CORT125281 was shown to enhance motor function in a traumatic SCI model in mice. Treatment with CORT125281 increased the number of NSPCs at the injury site in vivo. Flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analyses indicated that glucocorticoids induce NSPC arrest in the G1/G0 phase through the p53 signaling pathway. Glucocorticoids increased the expression of cell-cycle regulatory genes p15, p16, p18, and p27 in adult spinal cord NSPCs. In summary, our data suggest that glucocorticoids elevation following SCI suppresses the proliferation of endogenous NSPCs via glucocorticoid receptor activation. Targeting glucocorticoid receptors with specific inhibitors may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to promote recovery after spinal cord injury.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

The factors which account for this pattern of degeneration are unclear, as AD risk genes are numerous and often broadly expressed. Previously, we generated a model of AD using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which the AD risk variant of apolipoprotein E, APOE4, is pan-neuronally expressed. We showed that HSN class motor neurons degenerate in early adult. Here, we expand on our past work by performing behavioral analyses to deduce the effect of APOE4 on the function of distinct neuronal circuits. We found evidence that APOE4 induces dysfunction of other neurons; this spatiotemporal pattern of degeneration roughly correlates with endogenous levels of PTL-1, the C. elegans homolog of human MAPT also known as tau. Moreover, deletion of ptl-1 suppressed defects in multiple behaviors, suggesting broad protective effects across the nervous system including the HSN neurons. Lastly, we show that PTL-1 in the touch receptor neurons, where PTL-1 is most abundant, is required cell nonautonomously for degeneration of the HSN neurons.

P.; Zeighami, Y.; Boire, D.; Dadar, M.; Maranzano, J.", "abstract": "Introduction. Post-mortem brain tissue is obtained from brain banks that provide small tissue samples, while gross anatomy laboratories could become a source of complete brains for neuroscientists. These are preserved with solutions whose chemical composition differs from the classic neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) used in brain banks, such as a saturated-salt-solution (SSS) or an alcohol-formaldehyde solution (AFS) that preserve antigenicity of the main brain cell populations. Since histology remains the gold standard in neuroscientific research, while MRI is the most common imaging modality, MRI-histology registration quality needs to be assessed to ensure the suitability using brains fixed with innovative solutions for research procedures. Hence, our goal was to compare the registration quality of human brains fixed with NBF, SSS and AFS, as well as the histological characteristics that could affect the registration. Methods. We used 12 human brain blocks of 3x3x3 cm3 fixed in our anatomy laboratory using SSS (N=4), AFS (N=4), or NBF (N=4). The blocks were scanned using a 7Tesla Bruker animal MRI scanner with a T2-TurboRARE sequence at 0.13x0.13x0.5mm3. Blocks were then cut into 40m thick sections (parallel to the 0.13x0.13 plane) using a vibratome. Sections were stained with histochemistry (HC) (Cresyl violet, Prussian blue, Luxol fast blue, H&E, and Bielschowsky) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the 4 main cell populations: neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP), microglia (Iba1) and myelin (PLP) either with or without an antigen retrieval (AR) protocol. Stained sections were imaged using a slide scanner microscope and segmented with masks using Display, and the sections were manually registered to the T2-TurboRare images using landmarks in Register (MincToolKit). Results. More landmarks were needed to achieve proper alignment of the histology to MRI images for the SSS-fixed blocks, due to the lower GM-WM contrast in these brains. However, there was no significant difference in the staining intensity of the histology sections of blocks fixed with the three solutions, while SSS-fixed blocks showed a lower percentage of overlap between the good histology quality masks and the MRI masks. This resulted in a sufficient registration quality of all blocks, although more challenging when fixed with SSS. Conclusion. We have developed histology, MRI and registration protocols that are of good quality in brain blocks fixed with solutions used in gross anatomy laboratories. These results are promising for neuroscientists interested in using full brains from anatomy laboratories, either using MRI, histology or registration of both modalities to study normal aging and neurodegenerative conditions.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Time-of- flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) in particular is commonly used to assess the morphology of blood vessels, but acquisition of MRA is time-consuming and is not as commonly employed in research studies or in the clinic as the more standard T1- or T2-weighted MR contrasts (T1w/T2w). To enable quantification of brain blood vessel morphology in T1w/T2w images, we trained a neural network model, anat2vessels, on a dataset with paired MR/MRA. The model provides accurate segmentations as assessed in cross-validation on ground truth images, particularly in cases where T2w images are used. In addition, correlation between features that are extracted from model-based vessel segmentations and from ground truth account for as much as 78% of the variance in these features. We further evaluated the model in another dataset that does not include MRA and found that anat2vessels-based vessel morphology features contain information about aging that is not captured by cortical thickness features that are routinely extracted from T1w/T2w images. Moreover, we found that vessel morphology features are associated with individual variability in blood pressure and cognitive abilities. Taken together these results suggest that anat2vessels could be fruitfully applied to a range of existing and new datasets to assess the role of brain blood vessels in aging and brain health.

Idebenone, a coenzyme Q10 analogue that interacts with both mitochondria and the tyrosine kinase adaptor SHC1, inhibits aspects of microglial activation in vitro.

Controlled cortical impact to adult male mice increased the microglial activation signature in peri-lesional cortex at 24 hours post-TBI. Unexpectedly, several microglial signature genes upregulated by TBI were further increased by post-injury idebenone administration. However, idebenone significantly attenuated TBI-mediated perturbations to gene expression associated with behavior, particularly in the gene ontology:biological process (GO:BP) pathways 'ephrin receptor signaling' and 'dopamine metabolic process.' Gene co-expression analysis correlated levels of microglial complement component 1q (C1q) and the neurotrophin receptor gene Ntrk1 to large (>3-fold) TBI-induced decreases in dopamine receptor genes Drd1 and Drd2 that were mitigated by idebenone treatment. Bioinformatics analysis identified SUZ12 as a candidate transcriptional regulator of idebenone-modified gene expression changes.

We developed the Peptide-Driven Identification of TCRs (PDI-TCR) assay that combines in vitro expansion of cells with peptide pools, bulk TCR sequencing, and statistical analysis to identify antigen-specific TCRs from human blood. A key feature of PDI-TCR is the ability to distinguish true antigen-specific TCR clonotypes from TCRs associated with unspecific bystander activation by comparing responses to non-overlapping peptide pools. We applied PDI-TCR to Tuberculosis (TB) patients, sampling blood at diagnosis and throughout treatment, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-sensitized healthy individuals (IGRA+). We identified hundreds of Mtb-specific TCRs, as well as unspecific TCRs, and characterized their phenotype in each cohort by single-cell RNA sequencing ex vivo. Mtb-specific T cells were highly diverse, with short-lived effector phenotypes only present in TB at diagnosis, while memory phenotypes were maintained through treatment. In contrast, unspecific expanded T cells were more clonally restricted, had a cytotoxic phenotype, and were maintained throughout treatment.

Intimin belongs to the inverse autotransporter family (type 5e secretion systems), which secrete the extracellular adhesive domain or passenger via a hairpin intermediate. While many of the next steps in secretion are now understood, how the hairpin initially forms is not known. We sought to investigate this by making point mutations at several positions in the {beta}-barrel domain of intimin, as this domain forms at least part of the secretion pore. We made the mutations in a wild-type background and in a stalled intermediate caught in the hairpin conformation, which allowed us to uncouple passenger secretion from hairpin formation. Surprisingly, most of the point mutations did not have an appreciable effect on hairpin formation or passenger secretion, and larger changes such as replacing the entire linker region with a flexible glycine-serine stretch showed only a modest reduction in passenger secretion. By contrast, mutations affecting a small {beta}-sheet at the extracellular face of the intimin {beta}-barrel between two extracellular loops and the C-terminus of the linker had a more pronounced effect on secretion, and abolishing this {beta}-sheet prevented hairpin formation and led to complete loss of the wild-type protein. Our results show that the intimin {beta}-barrel is remarkably tolerant to changes and that the {beta}-sheet on the extracellular side of this domain plays a central role in passenger secretion and protein stability.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

This includes geotagging individual carcasses, reporting where on or by the road each carcass is found, categorising the age and state of each carcass, and noting whether each carcass is new or previously reported. All this can practically be done with a smartphone while on foot, biking, or as a passenger in a motor vehicle. Repeatedly mapping all carcasses, whether or not they have previously been reported, allows for estimates of carcass persistence and detection probability for both taxa and road conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by reporting on its frequent use along one 16.2 km route of urban and rural roads in New Zealand over 12 years. Over this period, on 1,652 surveys, 4,034 new road-kill carcasses were observed, 62.4% of which were birds, 31.1% were mammals, and 3% were butterflies. Using carcass age and persistence, we estimate that the road-kill rate along this route has been at least 3,940-6,544 road-kill/100 km/year. There was considerable variation among taxa in carcass persistence and carcass position on and by the road, both of which will introduce biases into road-kill estimates if not accounted for.

Our findings reveal that microbiome assembly is largely driven by abiotic factors including elevation, temperature, rainfall, and evapotranspiration, but is not strongly constrained by phylogenetic relatedness. Identical species inhabiting two separate locations exhibited different microbiomes. By contrast, distantly related species inhabiting the same site had more similar microbiomes. The microbiomes of native species also differ from recently introduced, non-native Drosophila in terms of diversity, composition, and function.

Current lysosomal degradation strategies rely on lysosome-targeting receptors (LTRs), limiting their applicability. We propose that multivalent non-covalent interactions on the cell membrane can drive lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins without the need of LTRs. To demonstrate this, we designed antibody-polymer conjugates, viz. Polymeric Lysosome-Targeting Chimeras (PolyTACs) functionalized with ligands that would non-covalently bind with transmembrane non-LTR proteins, viz., helper proteins on the cell surface in a polyvalent fashion. Cetuximab-based PolyTACs decorated with 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonamide (ABS) ligands that cause multivalent interactions with membrane carbonic anhydrases induced degradation of EGFR, while atezolizumab- and trastuzumab-based PolyTACs effectively degraded PD-L1 and HER2, respectively. Additionally, PolyTACs using PD-L1 as the helper protein further improved degradation. Mechanistic studies confirmed clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis followed by lysosomal degradation of the target proteins.

Nonviral delivery of SaCas9-encoding mRNA and a pair of HBV-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) substantially reduced viral biomarkers and intrahepatic HBV DNA copies in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that fragmentation of HBV DNA primarily leads to its degradation. Hybridization capture sequencing analyses indicated that small insertions and deletions (indels) and structural variants including excisions and inversions of the viral sequences were accumulated in the residual HBV DNA. These assays also demonstrated that transient expression of the HBV-targeting SaCas9 significantly suppressed random integration of HBV DNA, while this therapeutic approach was unlikely to affect chromosomal translocations involving viral copies. Taken together, our results suggest that anti-HBV multiplex gene editing eliminates viral DNA from chronically infected hepatocytes, potentially reducing the risk of hepatocarcinogenesis associated with HBV DNA integration.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Biopolymer-based plastics, made from plants and microbes, are gaining popularity in food packaging due to their eco-friendliness, but degrade upon contact with water, thus requiring the addition of water-resistant materials. Lignin was extracted from cotton stalk using the acid-alkali method and was characterized through FTIR and 2D HSQC NMR to evaluate its structure and purity. Pullulan dialdehyde, gelatin, and lignin were blended using a green process to make water-stable PGL hydrogel film. Incorporation of Lignin into PDA/Gelatin blend, having imine bonds, increased network strength and solvent-resistance by extensive physical interactions like H-bonding and electrostatic interactions, which were confirmed through FTIR and XPS analysis. These films were cured at 60{degrees}C, making the process energy efficient. PGL film exhibited water stability, high mechanical strength, moisture barrier, and bioactive properties ideal for fruit preservation. Lignin improved hydrophobicity, hydrogel strength, biodegradability, and non-flammability relative to the control. The films' effectiveness for food packaging was assessed by analyzing the impact on the preservation and shelf life of kinnow oranges. Physical properties, such as weight loss, firmness, and chemical properties, including pH, titratable acidity, lipid oxidation, sucrose content, antioxidant activity, and ethylene concentration of oranges before and after packaging, were monitored. PGL film showed high stability in hot and ambient water, with a water swelling index of 303%, impressive tensile strength of 8.5 MPa, and elongation at break exceeding 72%. PGL-packed oranges produced 0.034{+/-}0.0032 ppm/g of ethylene after seven days, which is 4.2-fold lower than unpacked oranges, signifying the fruit preservation ability of PGL films.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

ABHD5 lacks catalytic activity and instead functions as an essential co-regulator of PNPLA enzymes. Understanding how ABHD5 interacts with lipid droplet (LD) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes is crucial for unraveling its regulatory role in lipid metabolism and identifying potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases. While previous studies have modeled ABHD5 structure in solution, its function relies on membrane interactions, requiring a detailed investigation of its binding mechanisms. In this study, we employed multiscale simulations with experimental validation to reveal how ABHD5 interacts with ER and LD. Our findings show that ABHD5 binds membranes through its N-terminus and insertion segment, which subsequently triggers structural changes in the pseudosubstrate pocket and alters lipid distribution. This study also identifies key residues essential for membrane binding, providing potential targets for developing lipid metabolism modulators.

Multiple recent proteomic biomarker studies have identified latent transforming growth factor binding protein-2 (LTBP2) as a circulating factor associated with disease progression in fibrotic lung diseases in humans (including IPF), but its role in the development of fibrosis is incompletely defined. LTBP2 competes with the large latent TGF{beta} complex (LLC) for binding to the N-terminus of fibrillin, and we hypothesized that LTBP2 deficiency would promote LLC sequestration in matrix and reduce TGF-beta signaling. We recently reported an LTBP2 knockout (Ltbp2-/-) mouse with no baseline lung abnormalities. Here we show that Ltbp2-/- mice exposed to either bleomycin or silica have a significant reduction in fibrosis compared to wild type controls. Consistent with reduced fibrosis, Ltbp2-/- mice have reduced TGF{beta} signaling and cultured primary fibroblasts from Ltbp2-/- lungs exhibited impaired migration in an in vitro wound closure assay. Transcriptomic analysis of bleomycin treated control and Ltbp2-/- mice identified multiple LTBP2-regulated genes, including the lncRNA antisense of IGFR2 non-coding RNA (Airn), which is upregulated in Ltbp2-/- mice and has reported antifibrotic effects in other tissues. Interestingly, we also observed that Ltbp2-/- mice had impaired epithelial repair after bleomycin treatment, a phenotype that also occurred in a naphthalene model of club cell injury. These findings provide evidence that LTBP2 is profibrotic and facilitates TGF{beta} signaling but is also required for normal airway epithelial repair.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

This study investigates whether PBM can modulate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in 45 healthy young adults. We conducted forehead transcranial PBM (tPBM) and intranasal PBM (iPBM) at the nostril level, and measured CSF dynamics using blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI). Our data demonstrates 4 min of PBM-induced increases in CSF flow. Our data shows that (1) even a short PBM of 4 min can induce a change in CSF dynamics, in the form of an immediate increase in intracranial CSF volume and a reduction in CSF inflow; (2) skin melanin had a significant effect on the CSF response in tPBM, with lighter skin associated with higher responses; (3) both iPBM and tPBM displayed a dose-dependent effect on CSF dynamics in terms of a fluence-wavelength interaction; (4) intranasal PBM (iPBM) can be used to produce a significant change in CSF dynamics that is equivalent to forehead transcranial PBM (tPBM) with a small fraction of the fluence. The most likely explanation for the observed fMRI signal changes in CSF regions of interest for both tPBM and iPBM is an increased CSF outflow pressure due to PBM-induced vasodilation that transiently increases intracranial CSF volume and reduces net CSF inflow. This study establishes that PBM can modulate CSF flow in the healthy human brain in real time. This study also suggests that iPBM may be more efficient in CSF modulation due to the proximity to the olfactory system and the lack of melanin dependence. The influence of melanin on tPBM, the feasibility of iPBM and the dose dependence of both will require further investigation in healthy and patient populations.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Such strategies need to be economically and environmentally sustainable and adaptable to the behaviour of local vectors. One such tool is Attractive Targeted Sugar Baits (ATSB) that exploit the necessity of sand flies to acquire sugars between bloodmeals. Here we explored the kinetics and cues for sugar and blood feeding to improve the efficacy of ATSBs against sand flies. Methods A fluorescent assay was developed to quantify sugarmeals to assess the feeding efficiency of colony-reared female Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies. Results Sand flies showed a range of preferences for different sugars presented on cotton wool and could be manipulated to deposit them into the crop and/or midgut. We found that the combination of 10% sucrose and 10% fructose allowed flies to obtain the largest sugarmeals taken to the crop. Sugarmeals were taken to both the crop and midgut when it contained 200 mM bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a source of protein and 1 mM adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a phagostimulant. Using this combination, the efficacy of the ingested insecticide fipronil was significantly increased; reducing the 50% lethal concentration from 584 M to 1.65 M in a sugarmeal that promoted the simultaneous uptake of the insecticide into the midgut as well as the crop. Conclusions In this study we highlight the potential of understanding the cues used by vectors to sugar feed and blood feed. By incorporating blood feeding phagostimulants, such as BSA and ATP, in ATSB we vastly improve their killing efficiency against sand flies. This demonstrates a new approach to target these disease vectors.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Bats are very sensitive to habitat destruction and land-use change, although some species have shown the capacity for adaptation to urban life. In this study, we tested to what extent urban insectivorous bats modify their feeding strategies in a recently human-modified tropical insular ecosystem. Using a DNA metabarcoding approach on fecal samples collected in seven roosts, we analyzed the dietary niche of free-tailed bats (Mormopterus francoismoutoui) endemic to Reunion Island. Our results revealed a wide dietary niche, including 174 arthropod species in 12 orders, among which lepidopterans were predominant. We identified several crop pests and disease vectors, highlighting the central role of this bat species for agroecology and epidemiology concerns. Our study also highlighted potential sex- and reproduction-related dietary strategies. Moreover, we found that agriculture areas, inferred from land cover surrounding bat roosts, were associated with higher relative abundance of Lepidoptera in the diet of bats. In contrast, bats roosting in urban areas increased their consumption of Blattodea. As Reunion free-tailed bats roost and thrive in human-modified landscapes, understanding the consequences of this dietary plasticity for bat health and fitness will be necessary for urban evolutionary research and conservation actions.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Here we evaluated the microbiome and exudate composition of Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp), a globally distributed foundation species, in response to seasonal nutrient availability and developmental stage. We combine 16S rRNA amplicon analysis of the giant kelp microbiome with carbohydrate monomer analysis of kelp exudates to examine microbe-exudate relationships. We found significant differences in the microbiome and exudate composition between seasons and developmental stages of giant kelp. Higher tissue-nitrogen content in the spring coincided with elevated amounts of glucosamine, a nitrogen-containing sugar, in giant kelp exudates, while senescence led to the release of mannuronic acid, an alginate indicator. The release of glucosamine and fucose-rich exudates was correlated with an increase in the abundance of bacteria within the Planctomycetota phylum, whereas mannuronic acid-rich exudates coincided with an increase in the abundance of members of the Flavobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria lineages. We investigated putative carbohydrate-microbe relationships by isolating a member of the Planctomycetota phylum from the surface of giant kelp. We demonstrate that the growth of this isolate on fucoidan and N-acetyl glucosamine, but not alginate reflects the observed abundance of this clade in the kelp microbiome in response to variable carbohydrate exudation.

Some are territorial, restricting their space use within territorial boundaries, whereas others at not territorial animals but still restrict their space use despite not being constrained by surrounding conspecifics. Staying within a familiar area can provide a range of benefits, such as using previous knowledge (i.e. memory) to efficiently exploit resources or because they can consistently return to key locations (such as a nest or sleeping site). In group-living animals, consistent space use could reduce the complexity of decision-making time (e.g. by choosing among known foraging sites), facilitating group cohesion. However, to date, little research has explicitly asked what factors determine whether groups use consistent areas. Here we used repeated movements by groups of vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum)--leaving and returning back to the same areas in response to seasonal conditions--to examine and disentangle social processes from spatial and ecological factors that might shape the distribution of animals over space. Specifically, we quantified (i) how groups distribute themselves over the landscape, (ii) if their space use is consistent across seasons with similar environmental conditions, (iii) how different social and spatial factors shape the consistency of space use by groups over time, and (iv) how social and spatial factors affect home range overlap between groups. We found that groups were highly consistent in their space use over time and that home ranges were distinct across groups. Fidelity to the core home range area was higher when group composition was more stable, while overall home range fidelity was higher when groups recently experienced milder ecological conditions. Overlap in core areas and the overall home ranges among groups were greater among groups that shared roosts and groups that were fused in the previous season. Home range overlap was also lowest during long intermediate seasons (i.e. a sampling period that immediately follows intermediate season conditions, as opposed to sampling periods that followed dry or wet conditions), suggesting that extended intermediate conditions allow groups to increasingly partition their overall space use. These results provide insights into how the movement decisions by groups, the distribution of animals, and group-level space use emerge, and the role of social and ecological conditions as potential precursors to territoriality.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we present The Freshwater Sounds Archive, a new global initiative, which seeks to address this knowledge gap by collating species-specific freshwater sound recordings into a publicly available database. By means of metadata collection, we also present a snapshot of the species studied, the recording equipment, and recording parameters used by freshwater ecoacousticians globally. In total, 61 entries were submitted to the archive between the 4th of March 2023 and the 30th of April 2025, representing 16 countries and 6 continents. The most numerous taxonomic group was arthropods (29 entries), followed by fishes (14 entries), amphibians (10 entries), macrophytes (7 entries), and a freshwater mollusk (1 entry). The majority of the submissions were from European countries (27 entries), of which the United Kingdom was the most represented with 14 entries. The next most represented region was North America (11 entries), followed by South America (8 entries), Oceania and Asia (5 entries each), Africa (3 entries), and the Middle East and Central America with 1 entry each. The global south, polar regions, and areas with an elevation >500 m (asl) were underrepresented. The field of freshwater ecoacoustics to date has largely focused on the analysis of sound types due to a current lack of knowledge of species-specific sounds. The Freshwater Sounds Archive presents an opportunity to move beyond the sound type approach, and towards an approach with higher taxonomic resolution, ultimately resulting in species-specific descriptions. Furthermore, The Freshwater Sounds Archive will provide freshwater ecoacousticians with one of the main tools required to start creating annotated training datasets for machine learning models from soundscape recordings by referring to known species sounds present in the archive. In the long-term, this will result in the automatic detection and classification of species-specific freshwater sounds from soundscape recordings, such as indicator, invasive, and endangered species.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Much depends on whether the chosen baseline has already undergone shifts in species composition because of hunting, habitat loss and degradation. However, few studies have assessed the influence of shifting baselines on estimates of anthropogenic impacts. Using new survey data from five West African land-use gradients, we examine how habitat patch size and structure influences the estimated impact of land-use change on bird species richness and functional diversity. We show that smaller forests have already lost many forest-dependent birds, particularly those with large body size or specialised ecological niches, leading to reduced estimates of biodiversity loss after deforestation. The steepest biodiversity loss was found in mid-sized forests whereas relatively shallow declines were estimated for the most extensive forests - despite their richer taxonomic and functional diversity. In these larger forest blocks, accurate estimates of biodiversity loss may require longer transects extending beyond the biodiversity shadow caused by the more extensive spillover of forest species into the surrounding landscape, potentially linked to source-sink dynamics. These findings suggest that biodiversity assessments are highly sensitive to baseline selection and transect design, highlighting the risk of underestimating land-use impacts unless shifting baselines are carefully considered.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Here we developed a quantitative IPCC tripartite risk mapping approach, combining hazard (projected pelagic fish decline), exposure (present day pelagic fishing intensity), and vulnerability (national dependence on fisheries) to generate global maps of pelagic fishery climate risk. Using a direct, empirical method of projecting fish trends based on plankton size-spectra, our risk mapping approach identifies fishing grounds across Southeast Asia, western seaboards of Africa and South America and adjacent islands at highest risk. We project substantial declines (~20%) in supportable fish biomass by the end of the century under a high emission scenario, which could be reduced (to ~10%) by strong global climate mitigation measures. With climate mitigation being the only clear route to curbing declines in fisheries carrying capacity, our approach guides the spatial prioritisation of broader mitigation measures which reduce other human pressures on fish stocks, including effort control and the development of protected areas which support essential fish habitats.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is unique among its relatives for its ability to thrive at high temperature. The genetic determinants of the trait remain incompletely understood. We sought to understand the contribution of species variation in mitochondrial DNA to yeast thermotolerance. We used mitochondrial transgenesis to show that S. cerevisiae mitotypes were sufficient for a partial boost to thermotolerance and respiration in the S. paradoxus background. These mitochondrial alleles worked best when the background also harbored a pro-thermotolerance nuclear genotype, attesting to positive epistasis between the two genomes. The benefits of S. cerevisiae alleles in terms of respiration and growth at high temperature came at the cost of worse performance in cooler conditions. Together, our results establish this system as a case in which mitoalleles have fitness benefits and work well in multiple backgrounds; given the high mutation rate of the mitochondrial compartment, they were also likely extra easy for the ancestral population to acquire. We thus propose a broader model in which mitochondrial variants may prove to be especially good candidates in the search for genetic mechanisms of the adaptive process.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

In vivo characterization of tumor using PET/CT and MRI is clinical standard. PET/CT highlights the metabolic aspects of the tumor, while MRI provides information on functional, metabolic and structural changes. Even with technological advancements in both PET/CT and MRI, a method that can precisely delineate infiltrative tumor boundaries from normal-appearing brain regions (NABR) in vivo is still lacking. To address this limitation, we explored a relatively new MR imaging method, the Nuclear Overhauser Effect Magnetization Transfer Ratio (NOEMTR), in conjunction with a gadolinium-based contrast agent (Gd-DOTA), to precisely delineate the tumor boundaries in a rat model of infiltrative gliosarcoma. NOEMTR imaging was performed in the rat model (n=5) before and after Gd-DOTA administration. The post-Gd-DOTA NOEMTR map was subtracted from the pre-Gd-DOTA map and compared with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images and immuno-histological findings. The resulting NOEMTR difference map clearly highlighted both the tumor core and infiltrative boundaries, which was not discernible on the post-contrast T1-weighted images. The extended tumor boundaries observed on the NOEMTR difference map corroborated with the IHC image, which confirmed the presence of infiltrative tumor cells and macrophages in these regions. Guided by the NOEMTR difference map, regions of interest (ROI) were drawn to quantify NOEMTR signal changes in the tumor core, tumor boundaries, and NABR post-Gd-DOTA. Tumor core showed a significant ~43% reduction in NOEMTR signal (p=0.003), while the tumor periphery exhibited a moderate reduction of ~10%, (p=0.045). No appreciable change in was observed in the NABR (p=0.371). In contrast, the post contrast T1-weighted signal changes in tumor core, tumor periphery and NABR were, 33.32% (p = 0.092), 3.8% (p = 0.478), and 8.7% (p = 0.464) respectively. These findings suggest that NOEMTR imaging provides enhanced tumor contrast, particularly at the infiltrative tumor margins, where conventional contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI may underestimate tumor extent. Histological validation confirmed the presence of infiltrative tumor cells and macrophages in the tumor periphery, as highlighted by the NOEMTR difference map. Overall, NOEMTR imaging, in combination with Gd-DOTA administration, demonstrates superior delineation of brain tumor boundaries compared to conventional MRI. As NOEMTR imaging is a fast acquisition scan (under 10 minutes) and performed on standard 3 Tesla, it can be easily integrated into clinical protocols. By improving visualization of tumor infiltration and distinguishing tumor regions from NABR, NOEMTR imaging holds promise for advancing neuro-oncological diagnostics and treatment planning.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

Since insects act as tiny biomechanical resonators, tuning their wingbeat frequency to the resonant frequency of their springy thorax and wings could make them more efficient fliers. But operating at resonance poses control problems and potentially constrains wingbeat frequencies within and across species. Resonance may be particularly limiting for the many orders of insects that power flight with specialized muscles that activate in response to mechanical stretch. Here, we test whether insects operate at their resonant frequency. First, we extensively characterize bumblebees and find that they surprisingly flap well above their resonant frequency via interactions between stretch-activation and mechanical resonance. Modeling and robophysical experiments then show that resonance is actually a lower bound for rapid wingbeats in most insects because muscles only pull, not push. Supra-resonance emerges as a general principle of high-frequency flight across five orders of insects from moths to flies.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

M.; Bullock, R.; Hemmings, N.", "abstract": "Long-lived species share several life-history traits that make them susceptible to extinction debt: a concept referring to the delayed extinction of species due to their limited ability to adapt to environmental change. This threat may go unnoticed, since adult populations can persist for prolonged periods of time before underlying issues with recruitment lead to sudden declines. Using novel methods for assessing rates of hatching success and embryo survival in reptiles, we provide evidence of extremely low early-life survival across multiple populations of the long-lived Giant Aldabra tortoise in the Seychelles, which is highly suggestive of future declines in this species. We argue that a reassessment of the Giant Aldabra tortoise threat status incorporating this information would result in an uplisting from Vulnerable to Endangered. More broadly, we stress the importance of considering reproductive success and productivity when evaluating the threat status and conservation management of long-lived species.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

M.; Pozzi", "abstract": "Background: Large-scale studies show that adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) generally have a higher imaging-predicted age relative to their chronological age (i.e., positive brain age gap) compared to controls, though considerable within-group variation exists. This study examines lifestyle, early-life, and genetic health risk factors contributing to the brain age gap. Identifying risk and resilience factors could help protect brain and mental health. Methods: Using an established model trained on FreeSurfer-derived brain regions (www.photon-ai.com/enigma_brainage), we generated brain age predictions for 1,846 controls and 2,088 individuals with MDD (aged 18-75) from 12 international cohorts. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for major depression, C-reactive protein, and body mass index (BMI) using large-scale GWAS results. Linear mixed models were applied to assess lifestyle (BMI, smoking, education), early-life childhood trauma, and genetic (PRS) health risk associations with the brain age gap. Additionally, we evaluated the link between the brain age gap and peripheral biological age indicators (epigenetic clocks). Results: Higher brain age gaps were significantly associated with BMI ({beta}=0.01, PFDR=0.02) and smoking ({beta}=0.11, PFDR=0.02), while lower brain age gaps were linked to higher education ({beta}=-0.02, PFDR=0.02). Higher childhood trauma scores predicted a higher brain age gap ({beta}=0.04, P=0.01). Higher brain age gaps were positively associated with all PRS ({beta}s=0.04-0.16, PsFDR=0.02-0.03). There were no significant interactions between diagnosis and assessed factors on the brain age gap. In a multivariable model, only modifiable health factors (BMI, smoking, and education) remained uniquely associated with brain age gaps. Conclusions: Genetic liability for depression and related traits is linked to poorer brain health, but health behaviors potentially offer a key opportunity for intervention. This study underscores the importance of targeting modifiable lifestyle factors to mitigate poor brain health in depressed individuals, an approach perhaps under-recognized in clinical practice.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Slow oscillatory activity during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep plays a crucial role in both physical health and cognitive functions. Enhancing slow oscillatory activity during sleep has the potential to benefit these domains, yet an optimal stimulation protocol has not been established. This study aimed to investigate whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), synchronized with the trough phase of 0.75 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can modulate EEG activity in the delta frequency range during sleep and enhance cognitive functions. Healthy adults participated in a within-subject, counterbalanced study design comparing real and sham stimulation conditions. Combined rTMS and tACS was applied over the bilateral prefrontal cortex before sleep. We evaluated (1) power spectral density and functional connectivity within the delta frequency range during resting state and sleep, (2) retention of declarative memory learned before sleep, and (3) sleep parameters including spindle activity, sleep stage ratios, sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency. The combined rTMS and tACS protocol significantly increased delta oscillatory activity during the N3 sleep stage compared to sham. Functional connectivity, as measured by global efficiency, was enhanced during the N2 sleep stage. However, the stimulation did not improve declarative memory retention, spindle activity or other sleep parameters. These findings demonstrate the potential of combined rTMS and tACS as a non-invasive method to enhance delta oscillatory activity during sleep. While the stimulation did not improve memory performance, its ability to modulate delta activity during sleep suggests potential clinical applications for addressing pathological alterations in slow wave activity during sleep.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Background Platelet microparticles (PMP) are elevated in and associated with disease activity in a number of diseases including cancer, neurological conditions, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. This finding raises the possibility of a removal of these microparticles as a therapeutic strategy. The Hemopurifier is an experimental device consisting of a plasma separator and an affinity resin containing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) affinity resin that has previously been shown to remove extracellular vesicles in vitro and in vivo. In this proof on concept study, we sought to determine ex vivo removal of platelet -derived microparticles from healthy human plasma by the Hemopurifier. Methods Two hundred milliliters of thawed healthy human plasma were circulated over the Hemopurifier device at a rate of 100 mL/minute. Plasma samples were taken at time points equivalent to a 4-, 6- and 8-hour clinical Hemopurifier session in a healthy adult. Microparticles were isolated from these timepoints and analyzed for treatment concentration changes. Platelet microparticle counts were determined by binding to antiCD41. Results The Hemopurifier removed 98.5% of platelet microparticles during the equivalent of a 4-hour clinical session. Conclusions We demonstrated that an extracorporeal device with a GNA affinity resin removes platelet microparticles from normal healthy plasma. Next steps would be demonstration of the removal of PMPs from plasma by the Hemopurifier in different disease states and characterization of the cargo within removed PMPs.", "date": "2025-05-11", "journal": ""}
