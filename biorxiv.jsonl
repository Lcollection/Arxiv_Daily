To increase knowledge in this area, we have examined the cis-regulation of the transcription factor dlx2b during zebrafish larval tooth formation. We have created a GFP knock-in line that replicates dlx2b expression during tooth development and have also isolated a minimal enhancer of dlx2b (MTE) sufficient for activating most of the tooth germ expression pattern. We have found that four evolutionarily conserved predicted transcription factor binding sites are required for the function of this minimal enhancer in both contexts. When the conserved sequences are mutated in a transgene it eliminates the activity of the enhancer and when they are deleted at the dlx2b locus it causes a dramatic alteration in the expression pattern. We hypothesize that disabling this enhancer at the dlx2b locus may be enabling other nearby cis-regulatory elements to take control of the promoter. These experiments reveal details of how cis-regulatory elements are working to control gene expression during organogenesis and highlight that much remains to be learned by empirical studies of gene regulation.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

MolEvolvR is a novel web-app allowing researchers to visualize the molecular evolution of their proteins of interest in a phylogenetic context across the tree of life. It accepts multiple input formats -- protein/domain sequences, homologous proteins, or domain scans -- and, using a general-purpose computational workflow, returns detailed homolog data and dynamic graphical summaries (e.g., phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments, domain architectures, domain proximity networks, phyletic spreads, co-occurrence patterns across lineages). MolEvolvR performs domain-centric searches to capture remote homologs that are missed by full-length searches, integrates domain architecture evolution with phyletic distribution analyses, and provides evolutionary context visualizations that reveal lineage-specific adaptations versus those that are broadly conserved. Thus, MolEvolvR is a powerful, easy-to-use web interface for computational protein characterization.

It has been previously shown that DENV-2 can infect C6/36 mosquito cells and cause initial cytopathic effects that dissipate upon serial split-passage to yield persistently infected cultures with normal growth and morphology. In other words, the cell line accommodated persistent DENV-2 infections. It has recently been found that insect viral infections induce the production of viral copy DNA (vcDNA) fragments via host reverse transcriptase (RT). The vcDNA occurs in both linear (lvcDNA) and circular (cvcDNA) forms and produces small interfering RNA (siRNA) transcripts that can result in an immediate protective RNA interference (RNAi) response. The vcDNA can lead to the host acquiring endogenous viral elements (EVE) in genomic DNA. Thus, we hypothesized that DENV-2 cvcDNA and DENV-2-EVE would arise in C6/36 insect cells challenged with DENV-2 virus in vitro. Here we describe the successful isolation and characterization of cvcDNA constructs homologous to DENV-2 from laboratory challenges with C6/36 cells. At least 1 of these appeared to arise from a DENV-2-EVE. We also show that a cvcDNA preparation derived from the DENV-2 infected in C6/36 insect cells and subjected to rolling circle amplification (RCA) significantly reduced DENV-2 replication when applied to naive C6/36 cells prior to the DENV-2 challenge.

The two undead RIM-like neurons participate in the RIM-containing circuit that computes movement. The addition of these two extra neurons results in animals that initiate fewer reversals and lengthens the duration of those reversals that do occur.

To understand cell-type specific regulatory networks, the ability to capture both transcription and chromatin accessibility simultaneously is crucial. However, joint measurements are technically challenging and current methodologies still face adoption challenges. Here, we present easySHARE-seq, an improvement on SHARE-seq, for the simultaneous measurement of ATAC- and RNA-seq in single cells. We address several limitations of the previous method by improving the barcode and streamlining the protocol. As a result, easySHARE-seq libraries have a usable sequence of up to 300bp (+200bp increase), making it suitable for e.g. investigation of allele-specific signals or variant discovery. Furthermore, easySHARE-seq libraries do not require a dedicated sequencing run thus saving costs. We applied easySHARE-seq to murine liver nuclei and recovered 19,664 nuclei with joint chromatin and expression profiles. By benchmarking against other combinatorial indexing-based techniques, we showed we can recover over 1.5 fold more transcripts per cell while retaining high scalability and low cost. To showcase our method, we identified cell types, exploited the multiomic measurements to link cis-regulatory elements to their target genes and investigated liver-specific micro-scale changes. We conclude that easySHARE-seq improves upon previous methods and can produce high-quality multiomic datasets.

Among these strains, we identified 131 shared essential or growth-defect-associated genes. Unlike the type strain, the clinical strains showed an increased requirement for genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the type VII secretion system under standard growth conditions, the same genes required for hypoxic pellicle-type biofilm formation in ATCC13950. Consistent with the central role of hypoxia in the evolution of M. intracellulare, the clinical MAC-PD strains showed more rapid adaptation to hypoxic growth than the type strain. Importantly, the increased essentiality of hypoxic fitness genes was confirmed in a mouse lung infection model. These findings confirm the concordant gene essentiality under hypoxic conditions in vitro and hypoxia-related conditions in vivo, and highlight the importance of using clinical strains and host-relevant growth conditions to identify high-value targets for drug development.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Associated with development towards cellulose-mediated self-flocculation in Zymomonas mobilis ZM401, the A526V substitution, previously not been recognized to affect the functionality of the EAL domain, downregulates the apparent catalytic activity of the PAS-GGDEF-EAL ZMO1055 phosphodiesterase compared to parental Z. mobilis ZM4 and equally in homologous protein domains independently of the genetic background. Substitution of A526, which is conserved among homologs, with amino acids with longer aliphatic side chains than valine have an even more pronounced effect.

Clinically, this treatment is administered monthly for women at high risk of fragility fractures, who are often years into menopause. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that dampening of bone formation occurs with continuous dosing at supraphysiological doses. Osteoporotic bone loss occurs rapidly during early menopause, followed by longer-term changes in bone mineralization and osteocyte activity. Whether earlier administration of lower-exposure Scl-Ab can mitigate bone loss and osteocyte-driven secondary mineralisation is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of early intermittent low-dose Scl-Abon: (1) osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, (2) perilacunar remodelling, (3) secondary mineralization, and (4) osteocyte mechanosensitivity. Female retired breeder Wistar rats underwent bilateral ovariectomy and received monthly low-dose Scl-Ab injections (2 mg/kg/month) from 3 to 14 weeks post-OVX, while a control group remained untreated. Early intermittent low-dose Scl-Ab treatment increased bone formation and reduced osteoclastogenesis and catabolic gene expression ((Sost, Ctsk, Mmp9) compared to untreated rats. Treatment also decreased the percentage of empty lacunae and the number of MMP14+ osteocytes, accompanied by lower perilacunar mineral density and smaller lacunar size, indicating improved osteocyte survival and reduced perilacunar remodelling. Conversely, expression of osteocyte-mediated mineralization genes (DMP1, PHEX, OPN, ALP) and mechanotransduction-related genes (Vcl, integrins 5, V, {beta}1, CX43, Axin2, IFT88, Adcy6, Pkd1, Cav1) were reduced.

They play a key role in the acquisition and adaptation of movements, a process driven by dopamine-dependent plasticity at cortico-striatal projections, which serve as BG input. However, BG output is not necessary for executing many well-learned movements. This raises a fundamental question: how can plasticity at BG input contribute to the acquisition and adaptation of movements which execution does not require BG output? Existing models of BG function often neglect the feedback dynamics within cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical circuitry and do not capture the interaction between the cortex and BG in movement generation and adaptation. In this work, we address the above question in a theoretical model of the BGthalamo-cortical multiregional network, incorporating anatomical, physiological, and behavioral evidence. We examine how its dynamics influence the execution and reward-based adaptation of reaching movements. We demonstrate how the BG-thalamo-cortical network can shape cortical motor output through the combination of three mechanisms: (i) the diverse dynamics emerging from its closed-loop architecture, (ii) attractor dynamics driven by recurrent cortical connections, and (iii) reinforcement learning via dopamine-dependent cortico-striatal plasticity. Our study highlights the role of the cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical feedback in efficient visuomotor adaptation. It also suggests a mechanism for early-stage acquisition of reaching movements through motor babbling. More generally, our model explains how the BG-cortical network refines motor output through its intricate closed-loop dynamics and dopamine-dependent plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Copy number variation (CNV) at specific genetic loci is associated with drug resistance and virulence, but information about its prevalence in endemic regions is limited. This study examines the drug resistance and virulence status of Leishmania strains in human and canine isolates from the Mediterranean region. Methods: Forty-eight Leishmania infantum isolates were whole-genome sequenced with nanopore long reads, followed by de novo assembly. We analyzed chromosomal aneuploidies and gene copy number variation in loci linked to drug resistance and virulence in Leishmania, alongside the genomic structure and rearrangements responsible for these variations. Results: Complete genomes were de novo assembled for 35 L. infantum isolates (22 from dogs and 13 from humans), revealing significant chromosomal variability. We assessed copy number variation for 22 potential biomarkers: 15 genes related to drug resistance to first-line drugs (METK for allopurinol; LdSMT for amphotericin B; AQP1 and H-locus for antimonials; LdMT, LdRos3, and MSL for miltefosine; PPM for paramomycin) and seven genes related to virulence (lipophosphoglycan and proteophosphoglycan biosynthesis, and the Lack protein). Drug-resistance biomarkers were identified in 80% of the isolates. Canine strains primarily showed resistance to allopurinol and antimonials, while human isolates exhibited a broader resistance spectrum, especially to antimonials and paromomycin. The co-occurrence of resistance biomarkers was common, especially for allopurinol and antimonial resistance. Distinct mechanisms underlie the observed copy number variations. Virulence-associated genes were less variable among isolates. Conclusions: The prevalence of drug-resistance biomarkers in Leishmania infantum strains from the Mediterranean region, as revealed by this study, underscores the critical need for routine resistance surveillance in managing clinical leishmaniosis. These findings not only inform current clinical practice but also pave the way for more effective management strategies in the future. Keywords.

By distilling hundreds of validated mitochondrial genes into 149 biologically interpretable MitoPathway scores, this streamlined mitotyping framework enables investigators to quantify and interpret mitochondrial diversity and plasticity from transcriptomic data across a variety of natural and experimental contexts. Using this approach, we show that mouse and human multi-organ mitotypes segregate along two main axes of mitochondrial specialization, characterize robust longitudinal and perturbation-induced metabolic plasticity in primary human fibroblasts, and resolve cell-type and single-cell mitochondrial recalibrations across the human brain and sperm developmental trajectory. Investigators can now use MitotypeExplorer.org and the associated code to visualize, quantify and interpret the multivariate landscape of mitochondrial biology.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

By coupling chromosome conformation capture (3C) with PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, here we develop a method (CiFi) that enables analysis of genomic interactions across repetitive regions. Starting with as little as 60,000 cells (sub-microgram DNA), the method produces multi-kilobasepair HiFi reads that contain multiple interacting, concatenated segments (~350 bp to 2 kbp). This multiplicity and increase in segment length versus standard short-read-based Hi-C improves read-mapping efficiency and coverage in repetitive regions and enhances haplotype phasing. CiFi pairwise interactions are largely concordant with Hi-C from a human lymphoblastoid cell line, with gains in assigning topologically associating domains across centromeres, segmental duplications, and human disease-associated genomic hotspots. As CiFi requires less input versus established methods, we apply the approach to characterize single small insects: assaying chromatin interactions across the genome from an Anopheles coluzzii mosquito and producing a chromosome-scale scaffolded assembly from a Ceratitis capitata Mediterranean fruit fly. Together, CiFi enables assessment of chromosome-scale interactions of previously recalcitrant low-complexity loci, low-input samples and small organisms.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Currently, no treatments are available that prevent progression to RA in at-risk individuals. In addition, diverse pathogenic mechanisms underlying a common clinical phenotype in RA complicate therapy because no single agent is universally effective in established disease. We propose that a unifying set of transcription factors (TFs) and their downstream pathways regulate pro-inflammatory cell communication networks, and that these networks allow multiple cell types to serve as pathogenic drivers in at-risk individuals and RA. To test this hypothesis, we identified ACPA-positive at-risk individuals, patients with early and established ACPA-positive RA and matched healthy controls. Single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were integrated to define key TFs, TF-regulated targets and pathways. A distinctive TF signature was enriched in early RA, established RA and at-risk individuals that involved key pathogenic mechanisms in RA, especially SUMOylation, RUNX2, YAP1, NOTCH3, and {beta}-Catenin Pathways. Interestingly, this signature was identified in multiple cell types and the pattern of cell type involvement varied among the at-risk and RA participants, supporting our hypothesis. Similar patterns of individualized gene expression patterns in varying cell types were confirmed in single cell studies of RA synovium. Cell communication analysis provided biological validation that diverse lineages can deliver the same core set of pro-inflammatory mediators to receiver cells in vivo that subsequently orchestrate rheumatoid inflammation. Longitudinal analysis showed that the signature cell type can evolve in individual at-risk participants but their core inflammatory mediator profile was stable. Cell-type-specific signature pathways could explain the personalized pathogenesis of RA and contribute to the diversity of clinical responses to targeted therapies. Overall, this study supports a new paradigm to understand how a common clinical phenotype could arise from diverse pathogenic mechanisms and demonstrates the relevance of peripheral blood cells to synovial disease.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Mechanisms by which ISs overcome these barriers remain unidentified. Here we find that the RNA-guided nuclease TnpB enables such a mechanism to bias its inheritance in plasmids. We show that TnpB, the likely ancestor to Cas12, enables a gene drive to spread the IS within multicopy plasmids and functions as a primitive anti-self defense system in conjugative plasmids. The gene drive between TnpB-bearing ISs and plasmids promotes the spread of both MGEs beyond the ability of either individually.

These covalent inhibitors shift the LBD towards a repressive conformation, where the activation function-2 (AF-2) helix 12 occupies the orthosteric pocket, competing with orthosteric ligand binding. Here, we provide additional support for this allosteric mechanism using two covalent inverse agonists, SR33065 and SR36708, which better stabilize the repressive LBD conformation and are more effective inhibitors of--but also do not completely inhibit--ligand cobinding. Furthermore, we show that ligand cobinding can occur with a previously reported PPAR{gamma} dual-site covalent inhibitor, SR16832, which appears to weaken ligand binding through a direct mechanism independent of the allosteric mechanism. These findings underscore the complex nature of the PPAR{gamma} LBD conformational ensemble and highlight the need to develop alternative methods for designing more effective covalent inhibitors.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Because passive (spontaneous) activity provides only limited information for estimating connectivity, perturbation-based approaches are widely applied in neuroscience, as they can evoke underlying hidden dynamics. However, the characteristics of such perturbations have typically been designed based on empirical or biological intuition. To enable more accurate estimation of connectivity, we propose a data-driven and theoretically grounded framework for optimally designing perturbation inputs, based on formulating the neural model as a control system. The core theoretical insight underlying our approach is that neural signals observed in the passive state lack sufficient latent information, which leads to failures in the system identification. Perturbations reveal these hidden dynamics and lead to improved estimation. Guided by these insights, we derive a theoretical basis for optimizing perturbation inputs that minimize estimation errors in neural system identification. Building upon this, we further explore the relationship of this theory with stimulation patterns commonly used in neuroscience, such as frequency, impulse, and step inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework for neuroscience through simulations grounded in experimental paradigms such as neural state classification and optimal control of neural states. Our theoretical analysis, together with multiple simulations, consistently shows that perturbations designed according to our framework achieve substantially more accurate system identification compared to the conventional, intuition-based inputs. This study provides a theoretical foundation for designing perturbation inputs to achieve accurate estimation of neural dynamics. This, in turn, enables reliable discrimination of neural states such as levels of consciousness and pathological conditions, and facilitates precise control of their transitions toward recovery from abnormal states.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

However, its applicability to neural systems with complex, multistable dynamics remains uncertain - particularly when using the standard estimation approach based on variational Bayesian inference under the Laplace approximation. To investigate this limitation, we constructed biologically grounded cortical columnar neural mass models exhibiting three distinct multistable regimes: bistable fixed points associated with decision-making, coexisting oscillatory states through period-doubling bifurcations, and deterministic chaotic dynamics. These models were used to simulate local field potentials, which served as inputs to DCM. Bayesian model selection successfully identified the correct model architecture in all cases. However, Bayesian model averaging of the winning models failed to accurately estimate extrinsic connectivity parameters, leading to substantial discrepancies between the dynamics of the reconstructed and ground-truth systems. These results suggest that even when model selection is accurate, parameter estimation can break down under complex dynamics. Compared to previous applications of DCM to simpler neural systems, our study highlights significant limitations in its ability to capture the structure of multistable and globally nonlinear dynamics. We conclude that caution is warranted when applying variational Laplace-based DCM procedures to experimental paradigms involving bifurcations, chaotic trajectories, or other forms of dynamical complexity.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Often in structure-based drug discovery, one can assume that all instances of a protein are equivalent at the resolutions needed for alignment and it therefore should be possible to harness information about particle poses from previous refinements.

Yet, the relationship among these roles is unknown. Here, we show DA's tripartite functions are causally linked by a process in which phasic striatal DA rapidly and persistently recalibrates the propensity to move, a measure of vigor. Using a self-timed movement task, we found that single exposures to reward-related DA transients (both endogenous and exogenously-induced) exerted one-shot updates to movement timing--but in a surprising fashion. Rather than reinforce specific movement times, DA transients quantitatively changed movement timing on the next trial, with larger transients leading to earlier movements (and smaller to later), consistent with a stochastic search process that calibrates the frequency of movement. Both abrupt and gradual changes in external and internal contingencies--such as timing criterion, reward content, and satiety state--caused changes to the amplitude of DA transients that causally altered movement timing. The rapidity and bidirectionality of the one-shot effects are difficult to reconcile with gradual synaptic plasticity, and instead point to more flexible cellular mechanisms, such as DA-dependent modulation of neuronal excitability. Our findings shed light on how natural reinforcement, as well as DA-related disorders such as Parkinson's disease, could affect behavioral vigor.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (GIAI) can persist for months after cessation of chronic corticosteroid therapy, predisposing patients to life-threatening adrenal crises. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged suppression are poorly understood and have been primarily attributed to delayed recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary function (Graber et al., 1965). We examined the timing of hypothalamic, pituitary, and adrenal (HPA) recovery after 8 weeks of dexamethasone (DEX) treatment in mice. During DEX exposure, HPA axis activity was fully suppressed. Within one week of withdrawal, Crh mRNA and plasma ACTH surprisingly rebounded above control levels, yet corticosterone (CORT) remained low for an additional seven weeks. DEX-treated adrenals were atrophic and contained large clusters of lipid-associated macrophages. Even after accounting for these macrophages, CORT secretion was disproportionately low relative to the size of the adrenocortical cell mass for at least two weeks after DEX withdrawal despite supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation. Thus, the adrenal is the primary site of post-withdrawal HPA axis dysfunction, involving both cortical atrophy and impaired steroidogenesis. We then assessed whether trophic stimulation of the adrenal using either a pharmacologic or genetic approach prevented GIAI. Co-treatment with DEX and daily cosyntropin, an ACTH analog, failed to prevent GIAI. However, mice with non-suppressible endogenous ACTH due to deletion of Nr3c1 (the glucocorticoid receptor gene) in hypothalamic neurons maintained normal adrenal function and histology despite long-term DEX. Localizing the mechanisms of post-withdrawal GIAI to the adrenal may permit the development of strategies that prevent GIAI by delivering sustained trophic support to the adrenal during the period of glucocorticoid exposure.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Phage-bacteria coexistence is often attributed to coevolutionary processes mediated by complex, pairwise infection networks. Here, using in vitro experiments and mathematical models, we explore how higher-order interactions function as a complementary, ecological feedback mechanism to stabilize phage-bacteria communities. To do so, we examine an environmentally-derived, synthetic phage-bacteria community comprised of five marine heterotrophic bacteria (Cellulophaga baltica and Pseudoalteromonas strains) and five associated phage. We used Bayesian inference to reconstruct free phage production in one-step growth experiments and then forecasted pairwise phage-bacteria community dynamics over multiple infection cycles. In contrast to model predictions of rapid bacterial population collapse, each bacterial strain persisted in the community. We hypothesized and then experimentally validated the relevance of lysis inhibition at relatively high viral densities. We extended models into a community context, corroborating complex coexistence of all phage and bacteria. Life history traits inferred in community fits often differed from those inferred in a pairwise context, implicating higher-order interactions as an additional, ecological stabilization mechanism. Follow-up experiments confirm that phage traits (including burst size) can shift when infecting single vs. multiple strains. More broadly, these findings suggest that complex community coexistence of phage and bacteria may be more common than anticipated when including feedback mechanisms outside of the growth-dominated regimes of fitted pairwise models that do not reflect the full scope of ecologically relevant contexts.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Based on this framework, we analytically derive the spectra for models of constitutive, bursty, and autoregulated gene expression. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained are then used to construct an exact spectral representation of the time-dependent distribution of gene product numbers. The spectral gap between the zero eigenvalue and the first nonzero eigenvalue, which reflects the relaxation rate of the system towards its steady state, is then compared with the prediction of the deterministic model, and we find that deterministic modeling fails to capture the relaxation rate when autoregulation is strong.

We believe this robust yet simple platform represents a key step towards the generation of off the shelf iCD4+ T cell therapies with utility for the treatment of a panoply of diseases including cancer and inflammatory autoimmune disorders.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Understanding how DNA sequence encodes biological function remains a fundamental challenge in biology. Flowering plants (angiosperms), the dominant terrestrial clade, exhibit maximal biochemical complexity, extraordinary species diversity (over 100,000 species), relatively recent origins (~160 million years), ~200-fold variation in genome size and relative compact coding regions compared with other eukaryotes. These features present both a unique challenge and opportunity for pre-training DNA language models to understand plant-specific evolutionary conservation, regulatory architectures and genomic functions. Here, we introduce PlantCAD2, a long-context, plant-specific DNA language model with single-nucleotide resolution, pre-trained on 65 angiosperm genomes, together with a series of cross-species public benchmarks for evaluation. Comprehensive zero-shot testing shows that PlantCAD2 (676 million parameters) efficiently captures evolutionary conservation, surpassing the 7-billion-parameter Evo2 model in 10 of 12 tasks. With parameter-efficient fine-tuning, PlantCAD2 also outperforms the 1-billion-parameter AgroNT across seven cross-species tasks. Moreover, its 8 kb context window substantially improves accessible chromatin prediction in large genomes such as maize (AUPRC increasing from 0.587 to 0.711), underscoring the importance of long-range context for modeling distal regulation. Together, these results establish PlantCAD2 as a powerful, efficient, and versatile foundation model for plant genomics, enabling accurate genome annotation across diverse species.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

A challenging, yet promising prospect is the extraction of novel insights into gene-regulatory mechanisms, by probing and interpreting such gene expression models. Using a branched convolutional neural network architecture trained on promoter and terminator sequences we predict gene expression for allopolyploid Brassica napus and the closely related model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. We validate the model by comparing predicted and measured expression across ecotypes. We also show that deep learning models can successfully capture the positional binding preferences of some transcription factor families, without having been trained on transcription factor binding data. Furthermore, we show that our model did not only detect local sequence patterns, but was also able to determine their function based on their positional context. We also found that increased prediction error correlated with additional more distal or epigenetic regulatory input. Our results demonstrate that deep learning can be used to understand the regulatory architecture of gene expression in plants. A better understanding of gene regulation in the context of polyploid genomes is of particular economic importance, due to their prevalence among major crops. In the future, we hope that such models may facilitate the targeted engineering of gene regulation in crops.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that gene-culture coevolutionary dynamics can fundamentally alter the conditions required for tradition formation, especially in the context of mate choice. Using simulation models of mate choice where female preferences are socially transmitted and male traits are genetically inherited, we show that the interaction between cultural and genetic transmission creates novel evolutionary dynamics. In a first model (hereafter the 'Cultural Model') representing classical cultural evolution scenarios, we show that traditions emerge only when conformity disproportionately amplifies majority behaviours. In a second model (hereafter the 'Gene-Culture Model'), we show that when mate choice depends on both preference and male trait availability -- distinguishing preference and choice --, even simple social learning strategies can establish persistent traditions. This occurs because of positive frequency-dependent interactions between preferences and traits dynamics that stabilize majority behaviours independently of majority exaggeration. Our findings have broader implications for cultural evolution theory, suggesting that many behaviours depending on resource availability may exhibit tradition-like patterns under less stringent social learning conditions than previously assumed. By distinguishing between preference and choice, and demonstrating the importance of gene-culture interactions, this study advocates for more integrated approaches to understanding cultural evolution that consider the interplay between multiple inheritance systems.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

We show that REST is phosphorylated by CaMKIV at Ser-322 site located within the linker between the 5th-6th Zn-finger domains. Phosphomimic REST mutant in Serine-322 decreased REST repressor activity and caused its transition from nucleus to cytosol, followed by degradation. Molecular dynamics simulations of the phosphomimic Nterminal REST and the DNA RE1 sequence revealed a sharp decrease in the stability of the REST-RE1 binding interface. Moreover, the homeostatic effects of CaMKIV on the amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents were inhibited by the genetic deletion of REST.

Paracrine signaling in the lung plays a critical role in regulating endothelial maturation and vascular homeostasis. Previously, we employed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) to systematically map ligand-receptor (L/R) interactions within the lung vascular niche. However, the functional impact of these ligands on endothelial biology remained unknown. Here, we systematically evaluated selected ligands in vitro to assess their effects on endothelial barrier integrity, anti-inflammatory responses, and phenotypic maturation. Among the top soluble ligands, we found that adrenomedulin (ADM) exhibited superior barrier enhancing effect on human pulmonary endothelial cell monolayers, as evidenced by electrical cell impedance sensing (ECIS) and XperT assays. ADM also exhibited anti-inflammatory properties, decreasing ICAM1 and increasing IkBa expression in a dose-dependent manner. Shear stress (15 dynes/cm2) alone increased endothelial characteristics, including homeostatic markers such as CDH5, NOS3, TEK, and S1PR1. ADM treatment maintained the enhanced level of these markers under shear stress and further improved anti-coagulation by increasing THBD and decreasing F3 expression, and synergistically enhanced the expression of the native lung aerocyte capillary endothelial marker EDNRB. This effect was completely attenuated by a blockade of ADM receptor, RAMP2. Together, these findings identify ADM/RAMP2 signaling as a key paracrine pathway that enhances vascular barrier integrity, anti-inflammatory phenotype, and endothelial homeostasis, providing a framework for improving the physiological relevance of engineered vascular models.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Each has extensive research showing their influence on the development and maintenance of addiction, but the degree to which they drive escalation in cocaine self-administration is poorly understood. Using self-administration, intravenous noncontingent infusions, and pose-estimation machine vision, we find that incentive salience, not psychomotor sensitization or tolerance, drives the escalation of cocaine self-administration in heterogenous stock rats. Individual differences in psychomotor sensitization or tolerance were found to have no effect on cocaine intake. Incentive salience as measured by locomotion and active lever entrances per meter traveled occurring before the self-administration session began (pre-lever activity measures) during Short Access (2-hours) was found to predict intake during Long Access (6-hours). Both pre-lever locomotion and active lever entrances per meter were found to increase during Long Access and after two-to-three days of abstinence. Critically, rats with low pre-lever activity during Short Access escalated both their intake and pre-lever measures by the end of Long Access to levels comparable with high pre-lever activity rats who maintained their elevated responding. These findings support the notion that incentive salience during Short Access is a catalyst to escalated use and an early marker of addiction vulnerability. Moreover, they suggest that individuals initially resistant to incentive salience can, with sufficient exposure, become sensitized and escalate cocaine use to the same level as more susceptible individuals. Analysis of pre-lever activity offers a novel longitudinal behavioral marker to predict vulnerability and provides a framework for understanding individual trajectories of addiction.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Its product DXP sits at a metabolic branchpoint between the biosynthesis of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), thiamin diphosphate (ThDP), and isoprenoids. DXP is formed via decarboxylation of pyruvate and subsequent carboligation with D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (D-GAP) in a ThDP-dependent manner. In the current mechanistic model, DXPS follows a ligand-gated mechanism. Pyruvate reacts with ThDP to form C2-lactylThDP (LThDP) which coincides with a shift to a closed conformation. The flexible spoon and fork motifs become ordered, situating the catalytic residue H299 within the active site which supports LThDP persistence and the closed conformation of the E-LThDP complex until binding of D-GAP. Our goal is to understand the molecular basis for stabilization of the E-LThDP complex in its closed conformation in the absence of D-GAP. We propose the conserved aromatic residues Y288, F298, and F304 in the E. coli DXPS spoon and fork motifs form a cluster upon transition from the open to closed form to position H299 within the active site, necessary for LThDP persistence. Here, we conducted mutagenesis studies to elucidate the roles of Y288, F298, and F304 in conformational cycling and catalysis. On each variant, the conformational equilibrium favored an open state, hindered intermediate formation and persistence, and promoted intermediate release from the active site.

We show that interference between two fast latent modes produces a measurable slow beat fslow that acts as a tissue-level clock. By sampling the dynamics at neutral moments, recurring instants of phase symmetry, we derive a reduced even circle map in which healthy homeostasis corresponds to locking within the specific 2/21 Arnold tongue. We then introduce a coarse-grained dual-field algebra that collapses the continuum description into three effective blocks ({Gamma}, a, b) capturing net electromechanical gain and dissipation. In this algebraic picture, ionic and rheological perturbations are represented as smooth deformations of the parametrization space ({Gamma}, a, b), while the clock variables ({Omega}, fslow,K2) provide experimentally accessible coordinates on those deformations. This construction offers a concrete bridge between molecular-scale regulation and tissue-level mechanics, connecting subcellular control to the emergent seconds-minutes slow clock that constrains division geometry. The theory yields three falsifiable predictions. (P1) Homeostatic epithelia exhibit a narrow shared slow-band peak in voltage and stress with high coherence. (P2) The effective forcing and coupling ({Omega},K2), derived from physical parameters without integer tuning, reside within the 2/21 tongue while avoiding broad low-order resonances.

Using a multimodal dataset with macrovascular correction applied to all rs-fMRI metrics, we first examined associations between EEG metrics and CMRO2, then applied mediation analysis to evaluate how CMRO2 mediates EEG-fMRI associations. We found that bandlimited EEG theta and alphafractional power was significantly associated with CMRO2. Bandlimited EEG coherence was also associated with CMRO2 across all the bands. Bandlimited EEG fractional power and coherence were also significantly associated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in a manner that varied by frequency. EEG broadband temporal complexity was positively associated with CMRO2; and EEG coherence was negatively associated with OEF. Notably, there are pronounced sex differences in these relationships, which suggests that the biophysical underpinnings of rs-fMRI are sex dependent.

Previous studies suggest that groove arises from the brains entrainment to rhythmical patterns of music in the delta-theta and beta bands, which enables the brain to predict temporal structures. However, this notion has only been tested using simplified or artificial acoustic stimuli and melodies, rather than naturalistic popular music. In this study, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) measurements with two measures of neural entrainment to test whether neural entrainment in the delta, theta, and beta bands predicts individuals groove ratings of musical and clapping stimuli, which served as a control. We presented nine pop music songs and twelve MIDI-based clapping rhythms, which participants rated for their groove perception on a 5-point scale. Our results show that music songs received very variable groove ratings while ratings of clapping stimuli showed less variability. Univariate analyses demonstrated that both music and clapping stimuli consistently entrained neural oscillations in the delta-theta bands, but not beta bands, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) and stimulus-brain coherence (SBC). ITPC and SBC in the theta band weakly, but significantly correlated with groove ratings in fronto-central clusters. Decoding of groove ratings from multivariate spatiotemporal-spectral EEG patterns of entrainment with curve-fitting and machine-learning models predicted groove perception with high accuracy, up to 0.8 Pearson correlation, where combined patterns of inter-trial phase coherence appeared more informative than patterns of stimulus-brain coherence.

We demonstrated that these transplanted cells progressively adopted both individual gene expression patterns and coordinated zonation profiles matching their new location, with strongly zonated genes showing the greatest adaptive responses. Pharmacological inhibition of EphA2 receptors disrupted zonation, revealing a previously unknown role for epithelial EphA-ephrin-A signaling in regulating enterocyte zonation. These findings demonstrate that self-organization through local epithelial cell-cell communication can generate spatial patterns independently of external positional cues or cell-autonomous programs.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

These signals are processed through cell type specific circuits traditionally defined by MSN dopamine receptor expression. However, classification by dopamine receptor type alone fails to fully specify MSN diversity and falls short of capturing the functional complexity of the striatum. Here, we combined single-nucleus multi-omic sequencing and high-plex spatial transcriptomics to build a comprehensive atlas of MSNs in the macaque striatum. Using multi-omic sequencing, we profiled MSNs across four anatomically and functionally defined territories, and we mapped these subtypes back into their anatomical context by integrating the multi-omic data with ~5.4 million spatially resolved cells sampled across the full rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral extent of the striatum. This approach revealed two previously undocumented ventral striatum (VS) subtypes, D1-VS-RGS6 and D2-VS-RGS6, which are molecularly distinct from known ventral striatal MSNs yet share core limbic features. We also uncovered gradients in matrix-compartment cell types along the rostral-caudal axis. Finally, by integrating MSN subtype-specific transcriptomes and ATAC-seq-derived regulatory annotations with human GWAS data, we demonstrate strong, cell-type-specific enrichment of polygenic risk for Parkinson's disease, substance use disorders, and psychiatric and cognitive traits, including a striking association of D2-VS-RGS6 with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Together, this multimodal atlas provides a foundation for linking primate striatal cell types to circuit function and disease mechanisms.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

R.; Kool, W.", "abstract": "How can humans manage multiple sources of information competing for attention? To approach this question, we adopted a multi-dimensional task-set interference paradigm that requires individuals to handle distractions from three independent dimensions. Behavioral results suggest that people track prior interference from each dimension to selectively modulate their attentional gain. Testing the mechanism of this adaptation at the neural level requires measuring multi-dimensional task representations. To achieve this, we applied representational similarity analyses and encoding models to human EEG and investigated how the history of interference simultaneously affected the time-resolved representations of target and distractor dimensions. EEG analyses revealed that target and distractor features are initially encoded in parallel, but distractors are rapidly suppressed around 250 ms, with suppression scaling with prior interference. Next, we introduced a task-specific proportion-congruency manipulation to study how learning the control demands of each task dimension shapes the proactive handling of multidimensional distractors. Proactive task-level control enhanced the efficiency of the same reactive suppression mechanism observed for trial-to-trial adaptation, without producing sustained preparatory changes. Finally, behavioral and neural effects converged to show that the strength of dimension-specific interference and adaptation scales with the speed of visual integration for each dimension, as captured by a connectionist model with temporal integration. Altogether, these results suggest that proactive control mechanisms operate on the speed and efficiency of a reactive suppression mechanism that constrains selective distractor representations from biasing the response process. More broadly, they show that multidimensional attentional control relies on selectively suppressing distractor representations after they are encoded, revealing a dynamic, dimension-specific mechanism that extends biased-competition and conflict-monitoring theories.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Yet no effective therapy directly targets this abnormal relaxation. Phosphorylation of troponin I by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) promotes relaxation, but global PKA activation has widespread, undesirable effects. Here we investigated whether selectively enhancing troponin I phosphorylation could improve relaxation without engaging the broader PKA signalling network.\n\nMethodsTo resolve cAMP signalling at subcellular scales, we combined real-time cAMP measurements with FRET-based genetically encoded reporters targeted to defined nanodomains, alongside biochemical and genetic approaches. Protein-protein interaction surfaces were mapped using peptide-array technology, which guided the design of a disruptor peptide to displace specific interactions. The peptides effects on cardiomyocyte function were assessed in vitro using rodent and human cardiomyocytes with biochemical assays, real-time imaging, and work-loop analysis. In vivo effects were evaluated through echocardiography and haemodynamic measurements.\n\nResultsWe identified a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism in which the cAMP-hydrolyzing enzyme PDE4D9 interacts with troponin I and restricts local cAMP levels within a nanometre-scale domain, thereby selectively controlling troponin I phosphorylation. We found that PDE4D9-troponin I association is markedly increased in cardiac disease in both rodents and humans. A peptide that displaces PDE4D9 from troponin I selectively enhances troponin I phosphorylation, accelerates cardiomyocyte relaxation, and prevents diastolic dysfunction in a mouse model of heart failure.\n\nConclusionsThese findings reveal a highly specific regulatory nanodomain governing troponin I phosphorylation and points to a first-in-class, mechanism-based therapeutic strategy with the potential to address a major unmet contributor to heart failure.\n\nClinical Perspective What Is New?O_LIWe identify a previously unrecognized, nanometre-scale regulatory mechanism in which PDE4D9 binds troponin I to locally suppress cAMP and limit troponin I phosphorylation.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrates that the PDE4D9-troponin I interaction is markedly upregulated in failing hearts in both rodents and humans, which can mechanistically explain the impaired cardiac relaxation.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that this interaction is druggable: a rationally designed peptide can selectively displace PDE4D9, restore localized cAMP-PKA signalling, and normalize myocardial relaxation without global cAMP perturbation.\nC_LI\n\nWhat Are the Clinical Implications?O_LIDiastolic dysfunction, a major cause of heart failure with no targeted treatments, may be amenable to therapies that modulate cAMP signalling with subcellular precision rather than global pathway modulation.\nC_LIO_LISelective disruption of PDE4D9-troponin I binding offers a mechanism-based approach with potential to restore diastolic function while minimizing off-target effects typical of GPCR-directed therapies.\nC_LIO_LIMore broadly, this work establishes a platform for targeting localized signalling domains, a concept that may extend beyond cardiovascular disease to other pathological conditions in which dysregulated cAMP contributes to dysfunction.\nC_LI", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

M.; Liu, L.; Bayen, S.; Dastmalchi, M.", "abstract": "Pterocarpans are structurally complex defence compounds produced by legumes (Fabaceae). They are commonly associated with antimicrobial activity and thought to be synthesized de novo or accumulated in response to microbial pathogens. (-)-Maackiain is a lineage-specific pterocarpan detected in some legumes, including red clover (Trifolium pratense). The biosynthesis of (-)-maackiain involves a distinctive methylenedioxy bridge formation step, predicted to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450. Specifically, this elusive P450 catalyzes the conversion of calycosin to pseudobaptigenin. We integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets of red clover roots treated with the fungi, Fusarium oxysporum and Phoma medicaginis, to identify candidate P450 genes. Over 40 molecular features were characterized as (iso)flavonoid structures, including the highly abundant O-methylated isoflavones (formononetin and biochanin A), as well as their derivatives. Long infection with P. medicaginis resulted in significant increases in (-)-maackiain, trifolirhizin and other pterocarpans. Concurrently, fungal infections led to upregulation of core and specialized metabolism-related transcripts, including those encoding phenylpropanoid and (iso)flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), variance-stabilized expression patterns, and enzyme-class phylogeny, we were able to curate five candidate cytochrome P450s for pseudobaptigenin synthase (PbS) activity, assayed in engineered yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). One candidate P450 was capable of methylenedioxy bridge formation, converting calycosin to pseudobaptigenin and pratensein to 5-hydroxypseudobaptigenin. Therefore, it was renamed T. pratense pseudobaptigenin synthase (TpPbS/CYP76F319).

J.; Joh, H.-K.; Ahn, W.-Y.", "abstract": "Background: Inability to manage conflicts between multiple decision-making systems is associated with various mental disorders including addiction. The imbalance between the Pavlovian and instrumental systems may contribute to smoking cessation failure and relapse, as excessive Pavlovian motivation may override goal-directed quitting attempts. However, the exact role of the Pavlovian bias in smoking cessation and its neurocognitive mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: Eighty-six smokers participated in a smoking cessation clinic, completing the well-established orthogonalized go-nogo task before and after the intervention. We applied computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses to investigate the role of Pavlovian bias and its neural correlates in predicting smoking cessation outcomes. Results: Computational modeling revealed that higher levels of Pavlovian bias were associated with treatment failures. Importantly, Pavlovian bias significantly moderated the relationship between clinic participation rate and the likelihood of smoking cessation, suggesting that such bias can undermine motivational effort to quit. Furthermore, individuals who successfully quit smoking exhibited increased Pavlovian bias toward reward following cessation, indicating a potential cognitive mechanism underlying the relapse cycle. Complementary fMRI analyses demonstrated that Pavlovian bias influenced valence encoding in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), suggesting altered decision-making neural circuits. Conclusions: Pavlovian bias can be a critical risk factor of relapse in the smoking population, while this bias can be increased in response to nicotine abstinence. Moreover, the results highlight the roles of the vmPFC in decision-making under Pavlovian-instrumental conflict, providing insights into the neural underpinnings of relapse vulnerability. Understanding these mechanisms may guide targeted interventions to enhance smoking cessation outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Pleasure plays a crucial role in positive reinforcement and motivation. Brain regions able to amplify positive hedonic reactions to sweetness, known as 'hedonic hotspots', are distributed within the mesocorticolimbic reward systems. The olfactory tubercle (OT), a part of the ventral striatum that receives olfactory input, contains distinct functional domains: the anteromedial domain mediates approach motivation toward odors associated with food, whereas the lateral domain mediates avoidance motivation away from odors associated with danger. However, it has remained unclear whether the OT modulates hedonic reactions to pleasant sensations. In this study, we made pharmacological microinjections in OT of in rats to examine whether these OT subregions can modulate hedonic reactions, as assessed by the taste reactivity test. Sweet oral infusions of sucrose solution were delivered into the mouth via an intraoral cannula, and the rats' orofacial and somatic hedonic reactions were recorded and analyzed. We compared three pharmacological agents: mu-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO, orexin-A peptide, and GABAA receptor agonist muscimol. Microinjection of any of these drugs into the anteromedial OT subregion enhanced hedonic 'liking' reactions to sucrose. Furthermore, DAMGO injection into the anteromedial OT subregion recruited distant Fos expression in other 'hedonic hotspots', including in the caudal ventral pallidum and the rostromedial orbitofrontal cortex. By contrast, the same microinjections into the anterolateral OT subregion failed to enhance 'liking' reactions and, DAMGO oppositely increased aversive 'disgust' reactions. These findings suggest that the anteromedial OT contains a 'hedonic hotspot', whereas the anterolateral OT may contain a suppressive opioid 'hedonic coldspot'.

Thus, variation in myelin sheath length has been proposed to coordinate the timing of neuronal signaling to ultimately impact behavior. The mechanisms to establish myelin sheath length are unknown. For decades, reports have documented that in vivo myelin sheath size scales with the diameter of the ensheathed axon. We previously demonstrated diameter is sufficient to instruct myelin sheath lengths formed by oligodendrocytes using a synthetic axon culture system. The mechanisms of oligodendrocyte diameter-sensing and its translation into sheath elongation are still unknown. Here we demonstrate that diameter-sensing and sheath length is locally regulated: each individual myelin sheath responds to the underlying fiber diameter. We uncover a novel mechanism for scaling myelin sheath length to fiber diameter, through mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. In vivo, Piezo1 impacts the elongation of myelin sheaths on large diameter axons, recapitulating our in vitro results. Yet, surprisingly, there is no impact on myelin thickness with conditional Piezo1 loss.

P.", "abstract": "Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major bacterial pathogens responsible for the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. The bacterium codes for multiple TonB-dependent receptors required for acquisition of nutrients such as heme and vitamin B12, although the identity of a TonB energy transducer has yet to be identified. Here we identify a potential TonB protein encoded by PG0785, generate a deficient strain, and characterize its biological significance. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that the PG0785 has unique features confined to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group of bacteria but shares similarities in the C-terminal domain (CTD) to well characterized proteins from Helicobacter pylori and Escherichia coli. Similarity at a protein level, as well as the genomic locus organization, was identified with the TonB proteins characterized in other Bacteroidota species. Loss of PG0785 led to significant alteration of the proteome: proteins mediating gene regulation, protein translation, protection against reactive radical species (oxygen and nitrogen), and glycosylation were up-regulated and polysaccharide export, efflux protein, and lipoproteins were downregulated. Furthermore, phenotypic studies showed that a mutant lacking PG0785 cannot accumulate heme on its surface and is deficient in gingipain protease activity. In addition, reduction of the capsular layer was detected in the TonB-deficient strain. Thus, while the mutant interacted and invaded eukaryotic cells at much higher levels than the wild type, it had significantly reduced ability to survive with host cells.\n\nImportanceThe TonB system is indispensable for energy transduction in Gram-negative bacteria and is mainly associated with nutrient uptake. Although well investigated in Proteobacteria, the knowledge regarding the system in the CFB group of bacteria is lagging. In contrast to Proteobacteria, the intestinal Bacteroidota have multiple TonBs and their novel involvement in sugar utilization has been demonstrated. This study shows that the oral Bacteroidota, Porphyromonas gingivalis, also has TonB but unexpectedly, it is not involved in iron homeostasis or nutrient acquisition but rather in processes involved in maturation of proteases and cell surface remodeling. As maintenance of outer membrane integrity is mainly associated with Tol motor our study shows possible crosstalk between the energy transducers. Also, this study further demonstrates the functional versatility of the TonB system depending on the environmental niche and the metabolic requirements of the bacteria.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

The prototypical Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus (BUNV) possesses envelope-embedded glycoprotein spikes, with Gc head and stalk domains forming distinctive tripods covering the envelope-proximal Gn. Spike ectodomains mediate virus entry, while endodomains interact with nucleoprotein (NP) enwrapped genome segments to mediate virion assembly. Interestingly, BUNV Gc head/stalk domains are redundant for virus growth in mammalian cells, consistent with isolations of SBV from animals bearing head/stalk deletions. However, orthobunyavirus isolations from arthropods in nature appear to maintain these domains strictly.\n\nTo investigate this discrepancy, we compared the multiplication characteristics of wildtype BUNV (BUNV-WT) with a Gc head/stalk deleted BUNV (BUNV-{Delta}7). In mammalian cells BUNV-WT and BUNV-{Delta}7 grew to equivalent titres, whereas BUNV-{Delta}7 titres from insect cells were 1000-fold lower than BUNV-WT and strikingly produced no virions following blood meal infection of Aedes mosquitoes.\n\nTo understand this insect-specific restriction in virion production, we showed the intracellular abundance of BUNV-WT and BUNV-{Delta}7 Gc and NP components were equivalent, suggesting {Delta}7-Gc was assembly-deficient. To explore this, we investigated Gc and {Delta}7-Gc interactions during BUNV-WT and BUNV-{Delta}7 infections of both insect and mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation and multiplex mass spectrometry, revealing {Delta}7-Gc exhibited markedly reduced NP interactions in insect cells.

Orthobunyavirus Gn and Gc glycoproteins form spikes, which mediate entry and genome recruitment during assembly.

To investigate this discrepancy, we compared the multiplication of Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus (BUNV-WT) with head/stalk-deleted variant (BUNV-{Delta}7). In mammalian cells both viruses reached similar titres, but strikingly BUNV-{Delta}7 failed to produce virions in both insect cells and Aedes mosquitoes. We showed this was because BUNV-{Delta}7 failed to assemble new virions, revealing its head/stalk-deleted Gc was deficient in interactions with genome components. We propose that Gc drives species-specific interactions with genome segments during virion assembly, explaining why Gc head/stalk domains are conserved in nature due to their essential role in the insect host.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Our biochemical and structural analyses revealed that MccSep comprises four identical subunits, each containing five c-type hemes and one selenocysteine residue (U325). The enzyme catalyzes polysulfide reduction at a unique active site, where C239 coordinates with the heme iron center, while U325 plays a crucial role in the catalytic process. Genetic analysis further revealed the critical roles of U325 and C239 in driving in vivo elemental sulfur respiration. These findings unveiled a selenium-sulfur-dependent catalytic chemistry on a heme center during polysulfide reduction, expanding the scope of biological catalysis and deepening our molecular understanding of bacterial sulfur respiration.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Using live imaging and quantitative topology analysis in the zebrafish sub-intestinal vein plexus, we define the cellular events underlying flow-guided regression. Pruning occurs in geometrically disadvantaged, low-flow branches and is executed through transient polarity fluctuations, junctional remodelling and directed EC migration. We identify AmotL2 as an essential regulator of endothelial mechanical competence. AmotL2 maintains junctional architecture, actomyosin tension and appropriate cell packing, enabling ECs to polarise and rearrange in response to local flow differences. Loss of AmotL2 disrupts tension homeostasis, increases tissue compaction and prevents branch regression despite normal perfusion. In contrast, Yap1 plays an opposing, stabilising role, and its loss results in excessive pruning and network simplification. Together, AmotL2 and Yap1 constitute a mechanosensitive balancing module that interprets flow magnitude and vascular geometry to determine branch stability. This framework describes how mechanical forces sculpt vascular architecture during development and homeostasis.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

In eukaryotes, ATP/ADP nucleotide exchange in the Hsp70 chaperone cycle is stimulated by Hsp110, a divergent member of the Hsp70 chaperone superfamily and co-chaperone of Hsp70. Hsp110 is also a known modifier of neurodegenerative and other protein misfolding-related disorders. Biochemical aspects of Hsp110 chaperone functions have been characterized in vitro, and pathway interactions have been extensively characterized genetically in yeast model systems; however, a detailed understanding of its physiological roles in metazoans, particularly in the nervous system has not been carried out. Taking advantage of the single Hsp110-encoding gene in the Drosophila genome, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of its expression and function in this animal model. Notably, Drosophila and human Hsp110 share significant similarity in their sequence, structure, and splicing variants. At the protein level, Hsp110 is ubiquitously expressed, with both cytosolic and nuclear distribution in a tissue-dependent manner. Functionally, while Hsp110 is dispensable for cell proliferation in developing larvae, it is essential for long-term cell survival and normal development of the nervous system, including non-autonomous effects on neuronal differentiation and glial cell migration. Furthermore, despite being identified as a potent suppressor of protein aggregation and neurotoxicity in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, higher levels of Hsp110 are detrimental in flies. Overexpression of Hsp40, another key co-chaperone of Hsp70, can mimic this effect. However, simultaneous overexpression of both Hsp40 and Hsp110 does not further exacerbate their detrimental effect. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role of Hsp110 in neuronal development and cell survival, and further suggest that in vivo, the levels and activities of Hsp110 and Hsp40 co-chaperones need to be properly balanced. Furthermore, this work supports the contention that the Hsp70 chaperone network must be considered as a whole when targeted for potential therapeutic purposes to meet the complex pathophysiological demands in multicellular organisms.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Estrogens, including estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and estetrol (E4), regulate the female life cycle since early embryonic stages and play a crucial role in development, metabolism, and cell function. Throughout evolution, estrogen has regulated reproduction by affecting reproductive organ development and behavior. Estrogen impacts all vertebrates, including fish, and has a role in physiological and pathological states in both genders. The RUNX-2 gene is a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors and encodes a nuclear protein with a Runt DNA-binding domain. This protein is essential for osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis and acts as a scaffold for nucleic acids and regulatory factors involved in skeletal gene expression. The protein can bind DNA both as a monomer or, with more affinity, as a subunit of a heterodimeric complex. In 2022, a study was conducted to characterize novel genes that are regulated by estrogen binding to its receptors ( or {beta}). The PDLIM3 gene, with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.083, received the most stable CV score among other genes.

A modular human three-dimensional (3D) in vitro bone niche model is developed that integrates osteoblasts and osteoclasts within a mineralized scaffold, recreating an endosteal-like microenvironment for co-culture with PCa cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). The engineered construct maintains osteoblastic differentiation and supports osteoclastogenesis, confirmed by lineage markers including osteocalcin, osteopontin (OPN), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Co-culture with PCa cells downregulates osteoblast- and osteoclast-associated genes (IBSP, OPN, TRAP) in bone cells, suggesting tumor-mediated suppression of bone remodeling. Conversely, co-cultured PCa cells exhibit niche-dependent osteomimicry, characterized by upregulation of osteoblastic (SPARC, BGLAP) and osteoclastic (TRAP) markers and strongly regulated by the presence of osteoclasts. The platform also supports engraftment and proliferation of PDOs without PCa-specific exogenous growth factors, underscoring its translational relevance.

S.; Wang, S.", "abstract": "Understanding how genomic sequences shape three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture is fundamental to interpreting diverse biological processes. Although previous studies have shown that sequence information can predict 3D genome architecture, they fall short in capturing cell type-specific structures because they are trained solely on sequence inputs. The widely available Hi-C data, which contain rich structural information across biosamples, can provide complementary features to sequence data for studying cell type-specific architectures. Recently, DNA foundation models have demonstrated encouraging performance in capturing long-range genomic dependencies, holding promise for modeling chromatin interactions. However, the extremely high computational cost of running these models limits their applicability to Hi-C analysis, which requires genome-wide sequence embeddings. Here, we present Evo2HiC, a multimodal foundation model that jointly models genomic sequences and structures to study cell type-specific chromatin structure. The key idea of Evo2HiC is to distill a large-scale DNA foundation model, Evo~2 (7B), into a compact encoder, while guiding the distillation with Hi-C data to preserve genomic features critical for 3D genome analysis. The model supports two types of encoders, one that operates directly on DNA sequences, and a second that additionally takes as input corresponding Hi-C data. Using the DNA-only encoder and predicting Hi-C contact matrices, Evo2HiC improved Spearman correlation by 10.9% over Orca. Moreover, by jointly embedding Hi-C and sequence information Evo2HiC achieved the best overall Pearson correlation when predicting five representative epigenomic assays. Interpretation analysis of Evo2HiC revealed its ability to identify cell type-specific sequence motifs that explain changes in epigenomic signals. Finally, we demonstrated the cross-species generalizability of Evo2HiC on 177 species from the DNA Zoo dataset for Hi-C resolution enhancement. In summary, Evo2HiC is a foundation model that integrates genome sequences and 3D chromatin structure information, substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy on predicting various epigenomic signals and genome architecture, enables the identification of cell type-specific motifs, and demonstrates robust generalizability across species.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

The Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) framework offers an appealing alternative because it (a) captures nonlinear gene--outcome relationships and higher-order interactions, and (b) enables {automatic relevance determination (ARD)} through sparsity-inducing priors.

To ensure scalability to modern single-cell datasets, we further introduce a nearest-neighbor GP-based variant, NNCBKMR, which reduces computational complexity from O(N3) to nearly linear in N. Simulation studies show that CBKMR more accurately captures nonlinear effects and yields stronger marker-selection performance than BKMR and top ensemble ML methods (e.g., random forests, XGBoost).

CDH3 expression and associated signaling pathways were examined in Pten/Apc double-knockout mouse prostates and human datasets. Functional studies included antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) cytotoxicity assays and the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CDH3, tested in prostate cancer cell lines and xenograft models.\n\nResultsPten/Apc double deletion in prostate GEMMs led to highly aggressive tumors with markedly elevated CDH3 expression and enrichment of non-canonical WNT signaling components. Transcriptomic analyses of patient-derived prostate tumors confirmed that CDH3 is significantly upregulated in basal-like prostate cancer subtypes relative to luminal subtypes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed CDH3 expression predominantly in basal epithelial cells. Mechanistically, we found that active YAP1 signaling and a WNT5A-ROR2 non-canonical WNT axis drive CDH3 expression. Targeting CDH3 with a CDH3-specific ADC induced potent, antigen-dependent killing of CDH3 prostate cancer cells in vitro and significantly suppressed tumor growth in in vivo metastatic prostate cancer models. Likewise, CDH3-targeted CAR T cells specifically recognized and lysed CDH3-expressing prostate tumor cells while sparing CDH3-negative cells, leading to tumor regression and improved survival in mouse models, especially when combined with PD-1 checkpoint blockade.\n\nConclusionsCDH3 is a key marker and functional driver of basal-like prostate cancer.

Further, the actual impact of mtDNA copy number variation on cancer progression remains unclear with conflicting reports across a few cancer types. Here, through a pan-cancer analysis of whole genome data, we show that mtDNA copy number increases with an increase in mutational load in cancer. The increase in mtDNA copy number bears a signature of compensation for detrimental effects on mitochondrial function caused by increased mutational load. We also show that the samples with low mtDNA generally have increased expression of cancer promoting genes whereas high mitochondrial activity is linked to higher activity of tumor suppressor genes.

Notably, a growth in white-matter lesion (WML) volume, a hallmark of cerebral small-vessel disease (cSVD) with connections to progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, has been linked to cardiovascular disease. As such, measures of cardiovascular function such as heart rate variability may represent early and accessible predictors of WML development. Methods: This study used data from healthy adults drawn from the Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions (LEMON) dataset to examine heart function through measures of heart rate variability (HRV), as well as their relationship to cSVD as quantified through WML volumes, using FreeSurfer SAMSEG. WML volumes were segmented using 3T T1+FLAIR, T1+T2 or T1 images alone. Results: Results indicate that both young and old adults exhibited WMLs, and that lower HRV was associated with higher WML volume. This was particularly strong for high-frequency HRV across both young and older adults, but it was low-frequency HRV that was related to WML volume in an age-specific manner. Moreover, we showed that the WML-HRV relationship that is apparent using T1+FLAIR or T1+T2 based WML volumes could be observed even with T1w-based WML estimation alone. Conclusions: These results suggest HRV not only as an avenue through which cardiovascular risk translates into brain degeneration, but also as a potential early and readily measurable non-invasive predictor of later WML development and cognitive impairment.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) has recently been linked with impulse control, yet the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms through which this control occurs are unknown. A subset of vHPC neurons project to the nucleus accumbens (ACB), a brain region known for regulating reward and motivation. Here, we evaluated the role of vHPC-ACB signaling in food-directed impulsivity using fiber photometry and transsynaptic chemogenetic and behavioral approaches. Male and female rats were trained in the differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) test of impulsive action, where they learn to withhold lever presses for 20 seconds to obtain a palatable food reward. Photometry recordings during DRL revealed analogous elevations in calcium-dependent activity in the vHPC and ACB during the 5s immediately prior to a non-impulsive vs. an impulsive response. Chemogenetic silencing of ACB-projecting vHPC neurons elevated impulsive responses in DRL relative to vehicle treatment in males but not females, yet had no effect on home cage food intake, operant-based motivation to work for palatable food, impulsive choice, or anxiety-like behavior.

The exposure to sudden cold spells during summer combined with high light intensities can lead to photoinhibition of photosystem II (PSII) and thereby reduce photosynthetic efficiency. In this study, we aimed to analyse the dynamics of photoinhibition as well as related protection mechanisms of tall tree canopies during such cold spells. Therefore, we continuously assessed leaf level chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) and ecosystem carbon fluxes by eddy covariance in a temperate mixed forest in southern Germany during growing season 2024. While the deciduous, broadleaved F. sylvatica indicated chronic photoinhibition as a response to sudden cold spells, the evergreen, coniferous P. menziesii showed higher tolerance to low air temperatures. Both species increased thermal energy dissipation at PSII during cold spells indicating the activation of protective mechanisms. Likewise, both species exhibited mainly the sustained form of non-photochemical quenching (NPQs) as a reaction to chilling temperatures and high light intensities which maintained elevated during the recovery phases. However, the dynamics of upregulation of photoprotection and recovery processes differed between the two tree species. Furthermore, the integration of ecosystem carbon exchange and continuous leaf level ChlF measurements gave valuable insights into the photosynthetic dynamics of the mixed forest canopy. This study emphasises the importance of the combination of continuously assessed parameters within forest ecosystem on different scales for further research of photosynthetic stress reactions in forest trees.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we relate mean fitness under stabilizing selection to population size and trait architecture, using a simple application of theoretical predictions for the distribution of phenotypic values in a single-trait Gaussian stabilizing selection model. We show that mean fitness is maximized by a finite (often small) population size when the total mutation rate U across trait-affecting loci is reasonably large. Namely, this occurs when U > VM/8(VS+VE), where VM is the variance of the distribution of effect sizes of new mutations, VS determines the strength of stabilizing selection, and VE is the environmental variance. We validate these predictions using individual-based simulations and briefly discuss their implications for interpreting genetic load and adaptability in small populations.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we present MuRaL-indel, a deep learning framework that predicts germline INDEL mutation rates by leveraging long-range sequence context through a U-Net architecture. Using extensive rare variant data from large population cohorts, MuRaL-indel generates base-resolution, length-specific mutation rate maps for the human genome and achieves superior accuracy compared with existing models across multiple genomic scales. We successfully apply MuRaL-indel to three non-human species (Macaca mulatta, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana), demonstrating its broad applicability across taxa. Using the predicted mutation rate maps, we reveal the mutational landscape around human coding genes and show that MuRaL-indel-derived constraint scores better prioritize pathogenic INDELs than previous models. Through deep learning interpretability analyses, we uncovered sequence motifs--including both repeat and non-repeat elements--associated with elevated INDEL mutability, providing insights into underlying mutational mechanisms.

Here we investigate its non-immune role in initiating pancreatic fibrosis, a process driving therapeutic resistance and organ failure in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with unknown origins in early neoplasia. METHODS: Using human tissues and genetically engineered mouse models, we analysed FOXP3 expression in premalignant lesions.We employed epithelial-specific FOXP3 knockout and knock-in strategies to determine its functional impact on fibrogenesis and neoplasia progression. Mechanistic studies included chromatin immunoprecipitation, glycomic analyses, and signalling assays. RESULTS: FOXP3 was consistently expressed in the epithelial compartment of human and murine precancerous pancreas. Epithelial-specific deletion of FOXP3 attenuated pancreatic fibrosis and delayed neoplasia, whereas its knock-in induced spontaneous stromal activation and accelerated PanIN progression. Mechanistically, epithelial FOXP3 directly transactivated the glycosyltransferase GALNT1. GALNT1, in turn, mediated O-glycosylation of interleukin (IL)-6, which was essential for its rapid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our study establishes epithelial-derived FOXP3 as a master regulator of early pancreatic fibrocarcinogenesis. It drives a glycosylation-dependent amplification loop for IL-6 signalling, orchestrating sustained stromal activation. This pathway represents a promising target for intercepting pancreatic fibrosis and carcinogenesis at its origin.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Yet outside humans, research often equates individuality with personality, focusing on how one animal differs from another in each behavior. This overlooks the latent space that spans an animal's behavioral repertoire, how it is shaped by innate tendencies and prior experiences, and how it differs from transient factors. Here, we bridge this gap by integrating a data-driven framework with unbiased trait interpretation via large language models, revealing how social, sexual, and physiological conditions systematically alter the expression of personality-like traits in Drosophila melanogaster. This approach yielded four identities: space-use (exploration), time-use (social investment), avoidance, and aggression. Large language models produced strong consensus on the interpretation of some of these axes and divergence on others. These dimensions proved stable within individuals yet shifted predictably following mating, isolation, and microbiome manipulation, often in sex dependent ways. Notably, flies behaved differently toward familiar and unfamiliar peers, revealing a capacity for social memory. These findings bridge temperament and personality, showing how life history reshapes baseline tendencies into individualized profiles within constrained dimensions. They establish Drosophila as a tractable system for uncovering the biological logic of personality and advancing cross-species principles for individuality research.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

We address this question by analyzing C. elegans embryo behavior in snf-11 mutants, which lack a plasma membrane GABA re-uptake pump (orthologous to GAT1). At 510-570 minutes post-fertilization, embryo motion was transiently and potently inhibited in snf-11 GAT1 mutants, which precedes formation of most nerve ring synapses. This transient motion inhibition requires GABA synthesis in DD motor neurons and UNC-49 GABAA receptors in body muscles. When motion inhibition occurs, DD neurons have not yet completed neurite outgrowth. Genetic analysis suggests that motion inhibition was mediated by both synaptic and tonic GABA release from DD motor neurons. These results suggest that DD neurons control embryo behavior prior to completing their developmental maturation.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we propose functional topography covariance analysis (FOCA), a novel framework that quantifies convergent and divergent spatial alignments across individualized functional networks and further delineates their internetwork relationships, neurobiological basis, ontogenetic layouts, and cognitive outcomes. Across two well-established task-free functional MRI (fMRI) datasets encompassing both conventional and densely sampled scans, FOCA consistently revealed self-clustered hierarchies in the coordination of functional topographies, closely aligned with existing functional gradients and characterized by convergent couplings within primary systems and divergent couplings in higher-order systems. Such pattern was well predicted by fundamental neurobiological attributes, especially aerobic glycolysis. In a large public neonatal cohort, FOCA matrix exhibited adult-inverted hierarchical couplings and marked changes in auditory and action-mode networks, primarily driven by prominent redistributions of negative couplings. Moreover, neonatal FOCA profiles in the primary visual system significantly predicted neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months. Finally, compared with conventional functional connectivity (FC), FOCA proved more robust to global signals and more sensitive to the maturation of negative couplings. These findings highlight the critical role of negative connectivity in brain functional reorganization and advance our understanding of the cooperative and competitive relationships among functional systems and their developmental origins.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Archaea show considerable variability in chromosome and plasmid copy number, and organization. Stable maintenance of chromosomes and low-copy plasmids in organisms requires an active segregation system. Haloferax volcanii DS2 is a polyploid archaeon that contains a fragmented genome composed of a main chromosome, three secondary chromosomes, pHV1, pHV3 and pHV4, as well as a plasmid pHV2. Due to the high copy number of all replicons, genomic segregation in H. volcanii is typically considered random. However, we identified four two-gene operons encoding a ParA-like homologue and an uncharacterized protein. Here we characterized one of these systems, termed here HpaA (ParA-homolog) and HpaB, that is encoded on the secondary chromosome pHV3. HpaA, showing conserved ATPase walker motifs, is a ParA protein with a bacterial origin acquired via horizontal gene transfer. Mutation of key residues in HpaA alters its localization, and HpaA is necessary for proper spatial distribution of HpaB. HpaB, an archaeal protein capable of forming foci in the cytosol, is shown to function as a centromere-binding protein, thereby acting as a functional ParB homologue. qPCR data confirm that HpaB is crucial for maintaining the plasmid-to-chromosome ratio, as deletion of hpaB reduces pHV3 copy number. Single particle tracking suggests that absence of HpaB leads to an altered population distribution of HpaA, based on protein dynamics. Deletion of the genes hpaA and hpaB results in severe growth defects when cells are grown on xylose as a sole carbon source, in line with the location of the genes for the xylose degradation pathway on chromosome pHV3. We propose that H. volcanii has an active chromosome segregation system, essential for the two-dimensional segregation and equipositioning of its replicons. This function is crucial for ensuring stable replicon maintenance across the distinct cell morphologies of H. volcanii, which transition between rod-shaped and disc-shaped forms at different stages of growth.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

The secreted DNA has been shown to exert insecticidal effect against insect pests, which plays an adaptive role in plant-insect interactions, particularly in regulating populations of economically important sap-feeding insects. The molecular mechanisms behind this insecticidal effect are underinvestigated and remain largely unknown. Therefore, there is a need for more efforts in uncovering these mechanisms to better understand the plant-pest interactions, which would provide new insights into natural pest control strategies and inspire biotechnological applications. In the current work, we show that Pittosporum tobira (P. tobira) secretes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that exerts an insecticidal effect on Coccus hesperidum (C. hesperidum). We collected extracellular DNA from P. tobira leaves and tested its potential insecticidal effect by applying it to C. hesperidum, which is a well-known pest that causes damage to P. tobira. Our results reveal that the outermost layer of leaf cuticle of P. tobira predominantly contains single-stranded DNA of approximately 100 bases in length, originating from both chloroplast and nuclear genomes. This DNA exhibits pronounced insecticidal activity against C. hesperidum, with chloroplast-derived sequences significantly enriched compared to total DNA in intact plant cells. These findings suggest that the microevolution of the P. tobira nucleome and plastome contributed to the formation of extracellular DNA with insecticidal properties (eci-DNA) as part of its defence strategy against insect pests.

However, the influence of physical sediment properties, such as porosity, on taxon-specific eDNA preservation remains poorly understood, particularly in temperate inner-bay environments. Therefore, here, we characterized eukaryotic communities in sediment cores from the surface to 6-m depth in the inner and mouth regions of the Uranouchi Bay, a semi-enclosed embayment in temperate Japan. Both 18S rRNA and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene metabarcoding revealed marked spatial variation; specifically, inner-bay sediments were enriched in terrestrial plant DNA and dinoflagellates, whereas mouth sediments contained higher proportions of marine diatoms. Vertical profiles further highlighted differences in DNA persistence, with terrestrial and particle-associated taxa retained deeper in the inner-bay sediments. Land-sea connectivity and basin geography strongly shape sedimentary eDNA composition, reflecting both ecological sourcing and preservation bias. We further systematically analyzed the relationship between sediment porosity, a critical physical property governing pore water mobility and solute diffusion, and taxon-specific sedimentary eDNA preservation. To highlight effects of porosity independent of burial depth, we modeled porosity as a function of depth and correlated the residual porosity with the relative abundances of individual phyla. Notably, the phyla exhibited contrasting preservation patterns: Dinoflagellata, Euglenozoa, and Rotifera showed weak to moderate positive correlations with porosity, whereas Chlorophyta and Ochrophyta displayed weak negative correlations. When depth correlations were examined jointly, multiple distinct pattern groups emerged: some taxa (e.g., Dinoflagellata) exhibited negative depth but positive porosity correlations, whereas others showed opposite or neutral patterns. These divergent responses suggest that DNA preservation in marine sediments involves multiple taxon-specific mechanisms rather than a single universal process, with porosity acting as an independent determinant of burial depth.

Here we present a comprehensive single-cell epigenomic and transcriptomic atlas of various tissues from mice aged under specific pathogen-free (SPF) or germ-free conditions, revealing context-dependent effects of microbiota on cellular ageing. Microbiota conferred beneficial effects in young mice but accelerated various ageing features in old, such as age-related AP-1 pathway upregulation, senescence and transcriptomic alterations, likely due to age-associated dysbiosis. Strikingly, inflammatory signatures persisted across cell types in aged germ-free mouse tissues, establishing sterile inflammation as an intrinsic feature of ageing. Age-associated B cells expanded equally under germ-free conditions and (SPF) conditions, raising the possibility that they function as intrinsic, microbiota-independent drivers of inflammageing and potential therapeutic targets.

Towards developing broad-spectrum CoV and influenza vaccines, we and others previously designed and evaluated CoV and influenza stem antigens; but these elicited relatively weak and sub-neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses. Multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles (NPs) is an established strategy to enhance and shape immunogenicity. However, one facet of NP vaccines has been largely overlooked: the indispensable linker segment between the antigen and NP core. Here, we introduce de novo designed rigid (L2) and rarely used long flexible (L6) linkers to optimally display antigens on NPs, target occluded epitopes, and enhance cross-reactive Ab responses, using prefusion-stabilized Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (S-2P) and stem (SS) antigens as prototype antigens. Antigenic characterization of L2-NPs confirmed enhanced Ab binding and exposure of cross-reactive epitopes compared with L6-NPs and soluble antigens. Immunization with SS-L2-NPs elicited broader, more potent cross-reactive Ab responses across the seven human-infecting CoVs and pandemic threat WIV1-CoV, whereas SS-L6-NPs induced stronger neutralizing Ab responses against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and WIV1-CoV. Ab competition and systems serology analyses revealed that SS-L2-NPs elicit robust Fc-mediated effector functions.

We uncovered a dynamic gene regulatory network organized in two kernels that function as a toggle-switch controlling stochastic cell fate decisions. In cells derived from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, these waves of regulation are less pronounced and the switch remains in the OFF state with a higher probability, resulting in convergence into a restricted cell fate.

V.; Dey, S.; Tsai, F.-C.; Orsi, G.; Brasselet, S.; Hajj, B.", "abstract": "Accessing molecular orientation in single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) offers valuable insights into molecular ordering and organization in biological structures. Conventional single-molecule orientation-localization microscopy (SMOLM) methods typically rely on either engineering the point-spread function (PSF) of the microscope to encode the orientation information or on polarization resolved detection. While PSF engineering enables detailed orientation analysis, it often requires complex computational analysis and suffers from reduced performance in dense cellular environments due to PSF spreading and overlap. In contrast, polarization-based approaches are easier to implement and are more fit when imaging dense samples but are unable to retrieve the axial information of single molecules. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Polarization MultiFocus Microscope (PolMFM), a novel method for simultaneously retrieving the orientation and 3D position of single molecules. PolMFM combines the orientation measurement capabilities of a 4-polarization splitting scheme with a 3-planes multifocus microscope (MFM) enabling the reconstruction of molecular 2D orientation, wobble, and axial localization in a single acquisition. Through simulations, we demonstrate that PolMFM accurately recovers both orientation and 3D position, despite PSF defocusing. Experimental validation with reference samples shows that PolMFM matches the orientation precision of 4-Polar STORM, while uniquely adding axial information. We demonstrate the power of PolMFM by resolving the orientation and 3D positions of molecules in actin filaments in fixed cells, and by revealing that chromatin in crickets undergoes major reorganization and increased ordering during spermiogenesis. These findings highlight the potential of PolMFM for high-precision, multidimensional super-resolution imaging in complex and crowded biological environments.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we develop an experimental system to study how monolayer mouse skin responds to spatiotemporally patterned electric fields. We first show that local electrical stimulation can produce near global cell migration responses arising from cell-cell mechanical adhesion. We apply this strategy to 2D circular wounds using a local ring electric field near the wound edge and reveal how to tune the timing of local stimulation to avoid cellular jamming.

We then developed a Markov state model (MSM) to describe the binding mechanism in terms of binding paths. Binding paths are stochastic trajectories along which a small molecule diffuses across the disordered protein surface, forming transient contacts with overlapping groups of residues. The MSM enabled the quantification of the different states of the disordered complex, the corresponding binding affinities and transition probabilities. The visualization of the MSM via knowledge graphs provided a representation of the binding paths.

The Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has been the only licensed vaccine available for TB prevention. Despite BCG being administered intradermally for over a century to >100 million individuals annually, the molecular events in the skin following BCG administration have not been investigated; as a result, measurable correlates of protection that could predict vaccine effectiveness already early after vaccination are lacking. Here we show that BCG immediately (within one day after vaccination) induces dynamic molecular waves that drive the acute human host response across space (layers of the skin and systemically in blood) and time (days). Integration of this data across space and time identified robust networks of interactive modules related to immune surveillance (e.g. Langerhans cells), cell trafficking (e.g. endothelial cells, ITGB5), and trained immunity (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages, gamma-delta T cell). Importantly, not only were we able to identify BCG-activated pathways associated with trained immunity such as mTOR signaling and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, we were able to pinpoint the time-point and precise location (skin layer) of the initial activation of theses pathways. Combining tissue biopsies of human skin (spatial genomics) with 'liquid biopsies' (cell-free blood plasma RNASeq) following BCG vaccination our data both confirmed known evidence (e.g. prominent gamma-delta T cell induction at the site of BCG administration; negative correlation of blood vs tissue myeloid-derived suppressor cells), but also generated promising new leads such as baseline levels of B cells, platelets and nuocytes in the skin prior to BCG administration predict eventual outcome, and that these predictive differences in baseline cellular composition can be captured non-invasively using high resolution images of the site of injection (dermatoscopy).

Lines of evidence from non-human primate and human experiments suggest that one key causal contribution of the adult primate BG is invigoration of movement according to environmental and energetic constraints. Previous studies have come to this conclusion using primarily limb motor control tasks. We hypothesized BG are also important for invigorating the respiratory, vocal, and articulatory motor systems during speech production. To test this, we used a rare clinical opportunity to record local field potentials-broadband gamma activity (LFP-BGA) and single unit (SU) activity from human basal ganglia during deep brain stimulation implant surgeries. Participants repeated sentences aloud in the operating room. We modulated environmental and energetic constraints of speech production by inducing the Lombard Effect, wherein people reliably increase the intensity of their voice in the presence of background noise. Participants increased voice intensity, pitch, vowel space size, and respiratory depth in the presence of ambient noise. ~40% of LFP and SU sites were modulated by speech production. Comparing globus pallidus (GP) LFP-BGA, herein reported for the first time during speech, to subthalamic nucleus (STN) LFP-BGA revealed GP activated after STN. STN was more coincident with the speech preparatory period and GP more coincident with speech onset, suggesting differential roles in speech production. We found only weak evidence that STN or GP activity encodes the level of produced speech intensity. Instead, we found that LFP-BGA and SU-FR robustly track the ambient background noise levels. Linear decoding from SU-firing rate revealed we could infer the background noise levels with >75% accuracy in any given time point in the trial, including baseline. Importantly, the ambient-noise-modulated sites were an independent population from speech-modulated sites. We conclude that human BG encode the energetic constraints of communication. We theorize that the code is leveraged in downstream BG-cortical loop nodes to invigorate speech oro-motor gestures and co-speech manual limb gestures, both of which respond to ambient noise levels to maintain high-fidelity communication.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables the visualisation of cellular organelles within their native hydrated cellular environment at molecular resolution. Visualising the bacteria-material interface on nanostructured surfaces by cryo transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) requires the preparation of thin lamellae. Obtaining lamellae of bacteria directly on metal substrates while in a non-fixed and hydrated state requires cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling to isolate the targeted bacteria from the bulk sample. This approach faces additional challenges compared to tissues or cells on TEM grids, as titanium samples require a simultaneous cross-section of soft and hard materials at the same position and require vitrification, which embeds the sample in a thick layer of ice. Nonetheless, we demonstrate how to target a specific bacterium interacting with a titanium nanopillar surface using correlative cryo-fluorescence imaging, and how lamellae can still be prepared from vitrified samples by extracting the targeted bacterium and its surrounding as a small volume and transferring it to a receptor grid for thin lamella preparation, called targeted cryo-lift-out. Here, we outline the workflows and discuss their advantages and limitations for producing lamellae through lift-out techniques under cryogenic conditions, using methods that do not involve gas injection systems (GIS) for the lift-out transfer.

Since no rapid method for mating type characterization of strains is currently available, mating type identification must be performed through crossing assays, which are time-consuming. This study reports the development of two PCR-based molecular markers (MT_indel1 and MT_indel2) based on size variation to distinguish between the mating-type alleles of the oomycete Plasmopara viticola. For both markers, P1 strains (Mat-a/Mat-b) exhibited a double-band profile, whereas P2 strains (Mat-a/Mat-a) displayed a single PCR band. The markers were validated on a set of 37 reference strains collected across Europe and showed perfect concordance with mating-type phenotypes determined by crossing tests. They provide a robust, sensitive, and inexpensive DNA-based detection system for mating-type identification in P. viticola, offering valuable insights into the pathogen reproductive biology and genetic diversity.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

It is the only remaining African suid species without whole-genome data. The GFH is currently classified into three subspecies, differing in skull morphology and size. Here, we present the first whole-genome data of nine GFHs; one from Guinea and eight Uganda, representing the two geographically most distant subspecies. This genomic evidence allowed us to resolve the previously uncertain placement of the GFH among African suids as a sister group to the warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.). Also, we found a deep evolutionary split between the two GFH populations resulting in a level of genetic differentiation (FST > 0.75), which is similar to or higher than values observed among species of African wild pigs. The GFH likely diverged from warthogs around 4.6 Mya while the two study populations of GFH diverged at least 0.5 Mya and, subsequently, experienced very dissimilar demographic trajectories. The individual from Guinea had half of the heterozygosity level of the Uganda population, and lower value compared to all the African suids, probably as a result of the long term low Ne and isolation. Due to the close affinity of GFH with the African rainforest biotic zone, our findings have implications for understanding the history of habitat change in Africa. They also indicate a very deep and previously underappreciated evolutionary divergence within the GFH that may have implications for its conservation.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Despite its significance within the beef industry, no high-quality chromosomal level genome has been reported for this breed, limiting genomic selection and conservation efforts. Although there is a bovine genome reference, we need a breed specific reference to identify breed-unique alleles and structural variants that might not be explained by a distant reference. To address this, we generated a haplotype resolved assembly for Drakensberger cattle using a trio-binning where we employed PacBio HiFi reads for sire and dam, a combination of PacBio HiFi reads, Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads and Omni-C reads for the offspring. The assembled diploid genome size is 2.89 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 111 Mb and contig N50 of 61 Mb. The consensus accuracy was exceptionally high (QV = 70.23) and a genome completeness of 97.5 %, as analysed by the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO). The k-mer profiling suggested one of the strong haplotype separation for livestock with the paternity assembly containing 97.1% and maternity with 99.0%, combined diploid genome recovered 99.46% of all the solid read k-mers. We identified 14 telomeric ends across 13 scaffolds. The final genome encompassed a total of 22,854 protein-coding genes. This is the first high-quality, haplotype resolved genome assembly of the Drakensberger breed. This assembly high accuracy, contiguity and completeness place the genome among the highest-quality cattle genomes produced to date.

We investigate the role the membrane elasticity and cancer cell shape on deformation dynamics under the shear and pressure forces in a micro channel. The proposed numerical model is based on a hybrid continuum particle approach. The cancer cell model includes the cell membrane, nucleus cytoplasm and the cytoskeleton. The Dissipative Particle Dynamics method was employed to simulate the mechanical components. The blood plasma is modeled as a Newtonian incompressible fluid. A Fluid Structure Interaction coupling leveraging the Immersed Boundary Method is developed to simulate the cells response to flow dynamics. We quantify how subtle variations in these biophysical properties alter deformation indices such as sphericity and aspect ratio, and stress distributions on the membrane of the cancer cell. Our findings align well with existing computational and experimental studies. Results reveal that increased membrane stiffness reduces overall deformation as well as the total distance traveled. Similarly cell geometry strongly influences flow structure interactions: near-spherical morphologies exhibit stable deformation with minimal sensitivity to shear variations, whereas elongated geometries show pronounced orientation and stretching effects. Collectively, these findings highlight the critical importance of cell-specific heterogeneity in governing cell dynamics in microvascular flows. Furthermore, the intracellular and extracellular dynamics response of the cancer cell are intrinsically linked to their shape, in which certain morphologies displayed strong resistance to the fluid induced forces and the ability to migrate in various directions. The insights obtained provide a mechanistic framework for understanding circulating tumor cell transport in shear dominated environments during metastasis.

Target proteins present multiple binding surfaces with varying interaction potential. High-potential surfaces, or \"hot spots,\" are experimentally identified as the most probable binding sites in de novo discovery campaigns. However, hot spots and their default binding modes do not always confer the desired specificity. Related proteins or isoforms often share similar hot spots, resulting in promiscuous binding. Interaction with a hot spot may also fail to elicit the intended biological outcome. Consequently, methods that direct de novo binder discovery toward targets with defined specificity are critically needed. We recently developed phage-assisted non-continuous selection of binders (PANCS-Binders), a selection platform with unparalleled speed and sequence-function fidelity that enables routine de novo binder discovery within days. However, because PANCS-Binder selections enrich variants based primarily on affinity, secondary screening is unlikely to identify binders to lesser hot spots because of the high likelihood of convergence. These alternative binding surfaces with weaker inherent interactions may possess desirable specificity profiles. Here, we develop PANCS-spec-Binders, which incorporates simultaneous selection and counterselection to control the specificity of enriched binders. We demonstrate PANCS-spec-Binders in two proof-of-concept applications: (1) discovery of isoform-selective binders that bind HRAS with >100-fold higher affinity than the highly related KRAS isoform, and (2) discovery of epitope-specific binders that either target or avoid the LIR interaction region of LC3B.

Thus, we investigated the effect of pharmacological CDK inhibition on IC-activated neutrophil functions. Inhibitors targeting CDK1, 2, 4/6, 7, 9, 11, and 12 showed effects on different neutrophil functions (surface activation marker expression, ROS release, adhesion, apoptosis) in vitro. To analyse the inhibitors in a more translational approach, we proceeded with the systemic application of the effective inhibitors in a murine antibody transfer-induced local EBA model. In this predominantly neutrophil-driven model, we observed a reduction of disease severity upon treatment with CDK7, 9, or 11 inhibitors. Inhibiting these CDKs with topical THZ2, MC180295, or OTS964 also improved the clinical phenotype. Therefore, the most efficient inhibitor, MC180295, was validated in two other IC-mediated models of autoimmune disease: Serum-transfer arthritis, which also, but not exclusively depends on neutrophils and ITP, which is considered neutrophil-independent. Here, an effect in STA was observed, but not in ITP.

Using two different marine culture media, we isolated a diverse assemblage of endophytes, predominantly affiliated with Marinomonas, Celerinatantimonas, Vibrio, Halomonas, Kocuria, Bacillus, Metabacillus, Lysobacter, and Aureimonas , along with the fungi Paecilomyces maximus and Halophytophthora sp.

Analysis of osmotic and membrane-integrity challenges revealed that LRRK2 integrates multiple upstream cues through parallel interactions with Rab GTPases and GABARAP. Manipulations that caused lysosome enlargement, including inhibition of PIKfyve, showed that osmotic swelling leads to the accumulation of multiple Rabs on lysosomes and Rab-dependent LRRK2 activation independently of GABARAP.

Here, we explored the miR-16-1-3p/MDM2/p53 axis as a critical conductor of the TGF-{beta}-Smad pathway in osteosarcoma. Although miR-16-1-3p overexpression by itself markedly reduces proliferative and clonogenic potential of U2OS cells, when paired with TGF-{beta} treatment, it significantly increase arrest cells in G1 phase and nearly extinguishing the growth capability of these cells. MiR-16-1-3p overexpression inhibited TGF-induced actin remodeling and EMT featuring, significantly decreasing vimentin levels. TGF-{beta} enhances both 2D and 3D migration, but miR-16-1-3p overexpression, alone or with TGF-{beta}, strongly counteracts its pro-migratory effects. MiR-16-1-3p restored p53 stability by targeting MDM2, redirecting TGF-{beta}-Smad signaling toward p21 activation and proliferation inhibition while attenuating its EMT-promoting capacity. Administration of TGF-{beta} together with miR-16-1-3p dramatically increases the sensitivity of wild-type U2OS cells to cisplatin, exceeding that of TGF-{beta} therapy alone by more than an order of magnitude. Administering TGF-{beta} and miR-16-1-3p together significantly reduces the tumor nodule volume and Ki67 expression, while effectively eradicates metastases in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in vivo model. Analysis of the TARGET-OS cohort revealed that high TGFB1 and low MDM2 expression correlated with improved survival. For the first time, our research demonstrates that miR-16-1-3p shifts TGF-{beta}1 signaling from a facilitator of metastasis to a promoter of anti-growth effects through MDM2 inhibition and p53 stabilization, effectively reducing the self-renewal and invasiveness of cancer stem cells in human osteosarcoma model.

Cultivar differences were also apparent: modern cultivars had smaller tissues and fewer metaxylem vessels, reducing both axial and radial conductance and lowering whole-root water uptake capacity (~20-30%). By integrating field sampling with high-throughput image analysis and mechanistic modeling, this study establishes an integrated phenotyping approach that links root anatomy to water uptake and uncovers anatomical traits relevant to hydraulic function. The results show that longitudinal gradients and cultivar-associated anatomical differences contribute to variation in hydraulic properties and persist along fully mature root segments", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Such disease states can be modelled in animals using surgical procedures that, ethically, should involve administration of analgesia. However, since basic pain researchers often wish to measure pain-related events, animals may be denied peri-operative analgesia to avoid adversely influencing experimental outcomes. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peri-operative analgesia usage in rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) models. Using a combination of behavioural testing and in vivo electrophysiology in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, we assessed the impact of peri-operative pregabalin on nociceptive behaviours in the acute recovery phase, and behavioural and electrophysiological experimental outcomes in the chronic phase, of rat SNL and CIBP models. Results: A literature search revealed that, for studies using rat models of SNL or CIBP, only 5.37 % and 12.69 % respectively reported the use of peri-operative analgesia. We then demonstrated that the use of pregabalin as a peri-operative analgesic reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in the acute period following SNL surgery, with no impact on behavioural, electrophysiological or neuropharmacological outcomes in the chronic phase of either model. Conclusions: This study challenges the basic science researcher's reasoning that peri-operative analgesia confounds neurobiological outcomes. The use of peri-operative analgesia should be an important consideration to improve animal welfare in chronic models of pain.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease, microglia contribute to inflammation and tissue damage, but can also support repair by clearing myelin debris, limiting inflammation and promoting remyelination and neuroprotection. The timely transition from their pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative states is essential for effective repair and, in chronic MS, persistent, defective microglial activation contributes to disease progression. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the microglial switch remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that neuronal activity can modulate microglial signature at the onset of remyelination in MS models, in a pattern-dependent manner. Transcriptomic analyses reveal a downregulation of pro-inflammatory, disease-associated microglial signatures alongside an upregulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, indicative of a shift toward pro-regenerative states following physiological activity enhancement. This activity-dependent reprogramming also extends to infiltrating monocytes and macrophages, collectively fostering a microenvironment favoring repair.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "In young animals, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) undergo robust differentiation, progressing through stages to become pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes (Pre-OL) and ultimately myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). However, OPCs from aged animals have reduced differentiation ability. This disrupts myelin maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a lack of remyelination following demyelinating injury and impaired adaptive myelination as a mechanism of learning. To uncover novel factors essential for restoring resilience in aged OPCs, we employed a data-driven approach involving the development of a computational pipeline, gSWITCH (accessible at: https://altoslabs.shinyapps.io/gSWITCH/), that allows for capture of precise dynamic gene expression patterns to pinpoint potential 'switch' genes during lineage progression. Using gSWITCH to identify potential switch genes crucial for OPCs, we conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in OPCs isolated from young and aged animals. This revealed a group of transcription factors with decreased expression in aged OPCs. Further analysis of transcription factor binding site enrichment in OPC switches highlighted Bcl11a, a zinc finger transcription factor that could potentially serve as a master regulator of many switch genes. Ectopic overexpression of Bcl11a in aged OPCs did not enhance their proliferation; however, it significantly enhanced their differentiation into OLs. Overexpression of Bcl11a in aged mice, followed by demyelination injury in spinal cord white matter, significantly increased the differentiation of OPCs into OLs within the injury region compared to control aged mice. Furthermore, we found that Bcl11a is absent in invertebrates and has undergone pervasive purifying selection throughout vertebrate evolution, constraining its amino-acid sequence by eliminating deleterious mutations. Our study shows that reversing the age-related decline of this evolutionarily conserved factor in aged OPCs restores their impaired capacity for differentiation.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Yet, the underlying adaptive mechanisms remain partly understood, especially in non-model eukaryotes. Here, we examined how the cryotolerant yeast Saccharomyces eubayanus adapts to 60 days of cold (4{degrees}C) starvation, focusing on the roles of genetic and transcriptional changes. We find that the primary engine of the long-term adaptation is a stable, reprogrammed transcriptional state, rather than the selection of point mutations. Aged isolates exhibited improved growth performance and cryotolerance, a phenotype that remained stable for ~40 generations. This specialist adaptation involved a trade-off with tolerance to other stresses. Whole-genome sequencing revealed few fixed mutations, indicating that genetic variation did not drive the phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant physiological reprogramming, with cells shifting from anabolic activity to a catabolic, scavenging state driven by enhanced respiration and activation of the General Stress Response. This work highlights that a stable transcriptional state drives long-term cold adaptation, providing the foundation for the superior phenotype of aged isolates that persist through generations.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

This unprecedented warming is profoundly altering environmental conditions. Coastal areas, which are crucial for biodiversity and human activities, are at the forefront of these changes. Among the major environmental changes expected in coastal regions are shifts in wind regimes and an increase in storm frequency. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we demonstrated that (1) wind conditions in Arctic coastal regions during summer are changing, resulting in a rise in strong wind events. (2) These large-scale changes in wind dynamics influence the movements and fitness of seabirds, with broader impacts on panarctic socio-ecosystems. To demonstrate these effects, we used a long-term study of little auks (Alle alle), the most abundant Arctic seabird species and an ecological indicator of Arctic coastal ecosystems. We showed that during strong wind events, little auks significantly reduce the visits to the colony. These behavioural changes negatively impact their fitness as inferred from chick growth rates. Overall, strong wind events disrupt the delicate balance between parental investment and self-maintenance in this long-lived species.

We identify LAMA5, encoding laminin-5, as a candidate ISS gene, with rare heterozygous variants present in 1.2% of affected individuals. To define its functional role, we generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated LAMA5-knockout (KO) urine-derived stem cells (USCs) and induced chondrogenic differentiation in two- and three-dimensional culture systems. Loss of LAMA5 impaired chondrogenesis, with disruption of cell-cell junction programs and abnormal architecture of chondrogenic spheroids. Bulk RNA sequencing combined with weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed WNT7A and FLI1 as key dysregulated genes within the module most strongly associated with the KO phenotype. Gene Ontology enrichment of this module highlighted embryonic limb morphogenesis as the top biological process, and WNT7A was assigned to canonical WNT signaling. Pharmacologic activation of WNT signaling using lithium chloride (LiCl) partially restored expression of WNT7A, FLI1, TFAP2A, GRHL2, and PITX1 toward wild-type levels, indicating that attenuated WNT activity is a principal downstream consequence of LAMA5 deficiency. Consistent with this, we identified an individual with ISS carrying a heterozygous PITX1 missense variant, supporting convergence of ECM (LAMA5) and transcriptional (PITX1) perturbations on a shared WNT-centered limb-morphogenesis network. Together, these findings demonstrate that laminin-5 is required for proper ECM-WNT signaling integration during human chondrogenesis and suggest that dysregulated WNT activity represents a mechanistic link between LAMA5 dysfunction and impaired endochondral growth. Partial rescue by WNT pathway re-activation highlights a potentially targetable downstream mechanism in ISS pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

This asymmetry develops postnatally, persists throughout adult life, and is found in individuals from genetically isolated colonies. Voxel-based morphometry reveals that the larger left hemisphere is primarily due to differences in the volume of cortical areas linked to social cognition.

The mechanisms linking systemic autoimmunity to neuronal injury and neuropsychiatric symptoms remain poorly understood. Methods: Using the lupus-prone MRL/Lpr mouse model, we integrated systemic cytokine profiling, plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), region-specific CNS cytokine mapping, cortical metabolomics, and behavioral analyses to dissect immune-metabolic-neuronal interactions. Results: Inflammation was dominated by a Th1 cytokine program, with interferon-gamma emerging as the central driver. Composite cytokine scores correlated strongly with plasma NfL, establishing an immune-neuronal injury axis. Region-resolved analyses revealed distinct CNS cytokine signatures, including selective hippocampal loss of interleukin-10 and IFN{gamma}-dominated responses in the frontal cortex. Cortical metabolomics demonstrated diversion of tryptophan metabolism away from serotonin toward the kynurenine pathway, with increased quinolinic acid/kynurenic acid (QA/KA) ratio and upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (Ido1) and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (Kmo). NfL levels were negatively associated with serotonin and positively with 3-hydroxykynurenine and QA/KA, linking axonal damage to an excitotoxic metabolic environment. Importantly, cortical serotonin levels correlated with exploratory behavior, linking serotonergic depletion to anxiety-like phenotypes. Discussion: Together, these results delineate a cascade in which systemic IFN{gamma} is associated with cortical metabolic reprogramming and neuronal vulnerability, bridging peripheral immune activation with serotonergic depletion, melatonin loss, axonal injury, and behavioral dysfunction. Translationally, combined blood or CSF monitoring of IFN{gamma}, NfL, and kynurenine metabolites could represent a candidate biomarker framework for NPSLE.

Upon splicing, the tRNA exons are joined and the released free introns are rapidly degraded. Although tRNAs introns were previously considered to be junk sequences, we recently reported that free tRNA introns (fitRNAs) of S. cerevisiae serve as negative regulators of the cellular levels of mRNAs that bear long stretches of open reading frame sequence complementarity to tRNA introns. We also reported that 2 of the 10 families of tRNA introns, accumulate to elevated levels when cells suffer oxidative stress. The results led to the current investigations of the regulation of tRNA intron cellular levels. We document that tRNA intron turnover occurs by combinations of 5' RNA kinases, 5' to 3' and 3' to 5' exonucleases as well as by at least three endonucleases and, generally, the levels of each tRNA intron family are regulated by a unique combination of nucleases/kinases. Similarly, one family of excised intron can form circles whereas the other free tRNA intron families do not. Further, levels of individual tRNA introns differ in response to environmental conditions including type of media, stage in growth curves, and exposure to elevated temperature. Together, these findings highlight the many cellular pathways utilized to regulate tRNA intron levels and the specificity of these pathways for different tRNA families and varying cellular conditions.

Here, we systematically compared spectral data collected from rat kidney and liver tissues prepared using standard fresh frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue processing methods using quantum cascade laser (QCL)-based MIRSI. We applied frequently used spectral data processing techniques, including uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), correlation matrices, and second-derivative spectral analysis, to characterize preparation-induced differences. FF samples preserved a broader range of biochemical signals, retaining the innate chemical composition of tissues, while FFPE tissues showed reduced spectral diversity and absorption signal in-tensity. Moreover, a unique spectral band at 1026cm-1, likely arising from formalin-induced collagen crosslinking, was identified specifically in FFPE samples.

Harnessing viruses to convey guide RNAs (gRNAs) directly to the meristem promises to overcome those limitations and accelerate the generation of edited lines in diverse crops. With several RNA viruses, delivery of gRNAs to the meristem is enhanced with the addition of mobile RNA elements. We hypothesized that incorporating distinct RNA secondary structures as candidate mobility factors in the widely used Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) could propel virus delivery for enhanced meristem editing in non-model species. To test this, we engineered TRV vectors to deliver gRNAs targeting visible marker genes, with each virus incorporating unique mobility factors. We determined optimal virus construction for multiplexed meristem editing by first delivering each virus to Nicotiana benthamiana plants harboring the Cas9 transgene. Strikingly different phenotypes were observed among virus treatments, which were confirmed to represent distinct somatic and heritable editing events. We further tested our hypothesis by leveraging these results to edit pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), an emerging oilseed crop.

When asked to generate random sequences, people systematically generate too many alternations. At the same time, game-theoretic analyses of competitive interactions prescribe truly random mixed strategies as the unique way to remain unpredictable to an opponent. Despite this formal equivalence between randomness and unpredictability, research on cognitive biases in sequential judgment and on strategic behavior in games has largely proceeded in parallel, leaving open how biased internal models of randomness shape behavior when the explicit goal is to be unpredictable. Here we bring these traditions together in two experiments in which one group of participants generates sequences and another predicts them. In our first experiment, we show that when the goal shifts from being random to being unpredictable, participants reverse this pattern, generating sequences with a strong repetition bias. In a second experiment, we asked new participants to predict two model-derived sequences that were empirically calibrated to the group-level statistics from the first experiment (Competitive-like vs Random-like). We found a paradox: the repetitive sequences intended to be unpredictable were in fact more predictable than the alternating sequences intended to be random. This paradox appears to stem from an asymmetric reinforcement learning mechanism, whereby success selectively strengthens beliefs in repetition but not alternation. Our findings bridge classic cognitive bias and strategic behavior, suggesting how a fundamental learning mechanism can shape paradoxical predictability.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

We systematically analyzed the cellular organization and characterized the distribution of primary cilia and centrioles in the mouse and human brain microvasculature. We found primary cilia exclusively on human cortical endothelial cells (ECs), indicating inter-species differences between mouse and human. Primary cilia were frequently present on mural cells (MCs, smooth muscle cells or pericytes) surrounding venules and capillaries but rarely observed on arterioles in both mouse and human brains. These MC primary cilia exhibited heterogeneity in ciliogenesis, including cells with ciliary pockets, surface cilia, and a hybrid configuration we refer as a partial pocket. In the mouse brain, many MC primary cilia were closely ensheathed by astrocytic endfeet and occasionally extended between them to establish proximity to synapses, whereas all primary cilia in the human brain were confined within the basal lamina. Our analysis of cellular density revealed similar EC densities between arterioles and venules in mice, but not in human. EC centrioles were consistently positioned against the direction of blood flow relative to the nuclei, suggesting that they may serve as a structural marker for flow direction. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of primary cilia and centrioles, highlighting distinct interspecies differences between mouse and human brain microvasculature.

Critically these same ponds could also serve as pollution hotspots since stormwater ponds can act as local concentrators of urban runoff. One such contaminant of concern is lead, which remains a significant issue for human and ecosystem health in the United States despite regulatory bans on its use in paint and gasoline imposed in the 1970s. Despite high levels of lead in some urban stormwater, little is known about the distribution of lead in urban aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we characterized lead within the sediment, water column, and surrounding soil of stormwater ponds across the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Metro Area. We hypothesized that lead would be highest in ponds that receive runoff from landscapes with older construction (i.e., legacy leaded paint and gasoline), have high traffic volume (i.e., legacy leaded gasoline), and areas with low impervious surface cover (i.e., increased mobilization of contaminated soil). Moreover, we hypothesized that stormwater ponds capture lead within sediments, with more dissolved lead at the bottom of the water column, where it would interact with lead containing sediments. Across ponds, we found that age of parcel development where the pond was located was the strongest predictor of surface sediment lead content. Within pond sediments, we found that lead concentrations increased with depth below the sediment surface, which is unsurprising since depth is likely correlated with time. The strongest predictor of surface water lead concentration was the strength of pond stratification, while the strongest predictor of bottom water lead concentration was pond duckweed cover and water conductivity. Water column oxygen concentrations varied across ponds yet were not important in determining dissolved lead within the water column. Importantly, lead within pond water remained quite low despite elevated sediment lead levels. These findings confirm that stormwater ponds can act as one source of environmental lead remediation by capturing lead within sediments under a wide range of environmental conditions. Our results suggest relatively low lead release from ponds to downstream areas, indicating that ponds generally serve as sinks, not sources within the urban lead cycle.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

A species phylogeny for 91 members of Erythrobacteraceae, including the two new genomes, was generated from whole genome data, expanding the most recently published phylogeny for this family by 17 species. Results of the phylogenetic analysis indicate that all species which both possess the photosynthetic gene cluster and express bacteriochlorophyll a in culture form one clade, corresponding to the Erythrobacter genus.

Two methods of ancestral state reconstruction and gene order data are leveraged to determine whether secondary loss, horizontal operon transfer, or a mixed regime of transfer and loss explains the patchy distribution of the photosynthetic gene cluster in Erythrobacteraceae.

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, offers a potential strategy for overcoming resistance. Curcumin analogues with improved bioavailability, such as HO-3867 and AKT-100, exhibit potent anti-cancer activity, but their mechanisms remain under-explored. Methods: KLE, Hec50co and Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells were treated with HO-3867 or AKT-100. RNA sequencing, qPCR, and immunoblotting assessed ferroptosis-related gene expression, focusing on HMOX1. Intracellular iron and ROS were measured via FerroOrange and DCFH-DA staining. Cytotoxicity and colony formation were evaluated using CyQUANT assays, with pharmacological inhibitors (ZnPP, Liproxstatin-1, Z-VAD-FMK) and HMOX1 siRNA to dissect the roles of ferroptosis and apoptosis. Results: Both analogues upregulated multiple ferroptosis genes, prominently HMOX1. AKT-100 increased intracellular iron and ROS levels. Inhibition of HMOX1, ferroptosis, or apoptosis partially rescued cell viability, while HMOX1 knockdown enhanced clonogenic growth, confirming its key role in AKT-100 mediated cytotoxicity.

E.", "abstract": "Background: Since late 2022, the sale of most flavoured tobacco products has been prohibited in California, including menthol cigarettes. Tobacco companies responded by introducing ''non-menthol'' cigarettes in which menthol was replaced with WS-3, an odorless synthetic cooling agent to elicit cooling sensations similar to menthol. Legislation enacted in 2024 banned the addition of cooling characterizing flavours in tobacco products in California. However, the industry continues to market ''non-menthol'' cigarettes in the state, with very similar package designs. It is unknown whether these cigarettes contain a cooling agent. Methods: Available Newport-branded ''non-menthol'' cigarettes were purchased in California in 2025, extracted and tested for sensory cooling activity by Ca2+ microfluorimetry of HEK293T cells expressing the human TRPM8 cold/menthol receptor. Chemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GCMS). ''Non-menthol'' and menthol cigarettes marketed in 2023-24 served as controls. Results: Extracts from Newport-branded ''non-menthol'' cigarettes marketed in California in 2025 did not elicit sensory cooling activity. Chemical analysis confirmed the absence of menthol and any of the major commercial synthetic cooling agents. Conclusions: While the tobacco industry complied with California's new legislation banning cooling characterising flavours in tobacco products, this did not result in the market withdrawal of ''non-menthol'' cigarettes. ''Non-menthol'' cigarettes continue to be marketed with package designs resembling those of former menthol cigarettes, signaling the potential presence of a characterising flavour.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Modern swine production facilitates indoor respiratory contact between human employees and pigs in their care, creating conditions for interspecies transmission of influenza A virus (IAV). Sow vaccination is routinely practiced in the U.S. to transfer maternal derived antibodies (MDA) to piglets. Weaning is a highly stressful period for piglets that requires increased human interaction. This study investigates the effect of maternal antibodies on the susceptibility of weaned piglets to a human-origin H3N2 IAV. Weaned piglets often possess mixed immunity from MDA, which may be antigenically matched or mismatched to circulating viruses. Given the repeated spillover of human seasonal H3N2 into swine, we specifically examined how matched and mismatched MDA, acquired from vaccinated sows, influenced piglet susceptibility. Additionally, we assessed the impact of weaning-related stress on the outcome of viral challenge. The H3N2 virus was generated by reverse genetics to mimic the 2010.1 H3N2 introduction from humans to swine. Challenged seeder piglets were divided by immune and weaning status. Two days post inoculation, naive direct contact pigs were placed with seeders. IAV qRT-PCR and virus titration were performed on nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to evaluate shedding and transmission kinetics. Matched MDA were effective in reducing shedding in challenged pigs and minimizing transmission to contacts. There was an increase in shedding and transmission in weaned pigs compared to littermates that remained on the sow. These results identify critical control points in production where changing practices could mitigate human-to-swine and swine-to-swine transmission to prevent establishment of novel lineages in pig populations.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

They consist of a regulatory domain and an aptamer domain that binds a specific ligand, with their performance largely depending on the ability of the aptamer to control the regulatory domain. Expanding the range of synthetic riboswitches therefore requires the discovery and characterization of new regulatory aptamers. In the present study, we identified a doxycycline-binding aptamer with outstanding regulatory properties in both yeast and human cells which are based on a unique structural dynamic upon ligand binding. Single-molecule force spectroscopy revealed that doxycycline binding strongly stabilizes an intermediate aptamer conformation offering mechanistic insights into its function. The identification of the aptamer through a combination of parallel SELEX and subsequent in vivo screening in yeast, also provided valuable insights into selection dynamics and the first proof for the effectiveness of RNA Capture-SELEX in aptamer selection.

ROR1 RNA expression was first evaluated using a previously generated total RNA-Seq dataset from 47 B-cell lymphoma cell lines. ROR1 transcripts were detectable in most models, with 19 cell lines showing moderate to high expression. To determine whether ROR1 is present on the cell surface, we next analyzed 29 cell lines by flow cytometry using a PE-conjugated anti-ROR1 antibody. Only a subset of cell lines expressed appreciable levels of ROR1 on the cell membrane, with the highest expression observed in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) models compared with other B-cell lymphoma subtypes, and detectable expression in a few diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and one marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) line. ROR1 RNA and surface protein levels were highly correlated. As a proof of principle, four ROR1-positive DLBCL cell lines and one cell line with low surface protein were exposed to the ROR1-targeting ADC zilovertamab vedotin for 120 hours. All ROR1-positive models were sensitive, with IC50 values ranging from 28 to 58 nM, whereas the remaining one was largely resistant.

They are a common cause of epilepsy and their diagnosis through conventional imaging can often be challenging, hindering surgical treatments. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has the ability to infer tissue properties at the microscopic scale, making it a promising technique for detection of cortical dysplasias. This study aims to assess the microarchitecture of the cerebral cortex in a murine model of cortical dysplasia using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) acquired with b-tensor encoding. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered either carmustine (BCNU) or saline solution on day 15 of gestation. Their offspring were imaged at 120 days of age using a 7 tesla scanner, acquiring diffusion-sensitive images with b-tensor encoding. Images were processed with Q-space trajectory imaging with positivity constraints (QTI+) to derive various metrics along a curvilinear coordinate system across the neocortex. After scanning, the brains were processed for immunofluorescence and histological examinations. Experimental animals exhibited a significant reduction of microscopic fractional anisotropy ( FA) and anisotropic kurtosis (Ka) in the middle and lateral cortical layers compared to the control animals. Immunofluorescence and histological analysis showed decreased and dysorganized myelinated fibers, and an increase of glial processes in BCNU-treated animals. Given the applicability of b-tensor encoding in clinical scanners, this approach holds promise for improving detection of focal cortical dysplasias in patients with epilepsy.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

This progressive neurodevelopmental disorder hinders patients ability to breathe and eat normally. It is unclear how Mecp2-deficiency results in a high percentage of dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia in patients with Rett syndrome. We aim to determine the effects of Mecp2-deficiency on swallow related neuromuscular mechanisms contributing to dysphagia in Rett syndrome. Swallow and breathing were detected using electrophysiology in the submental and laryngeal muscle complexes and the hypoglossal and vagus nerves. Several medullary motoneuron populations involved in swallowing were examined by immunohistochemistry in pre and post symptomatic Mecp2-deficient male and female mice. Swallow-related submental complex duration and amplitude were significantly decreased in both Mecp2-/y and Mecp2+/- compared to wild-type, due to decreased motor unit activation. In both Mecp2-deficient mice, cholinergic staining in hypoglossal, facial, and trigeminal nuclei were decreased. We noted a significant increase in the transition time from inspiration to swallow, swallow to the subsequent inspiration, and impaired respiratory rhythm regeneration in Mecp2-/y, but not Mecp2+/- mice. Mecp2-deficiency resulted in impaired brainstem cholinergic signaling, which contribute to weakened submental muscle complex activity, and impaired swallow related laryngeal vestibular closure. These results suggest Mecp2-deficient mice are a viable pre-clinical model to further study dysphagia in Rett syndrome.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Ex vivo, activating VTAGG terminals evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses in LHb that varied with postsynaptic membrane potential. In vivo, VTAGG inputs drove net inhibition and supported positive reinforcement that was dependent on GABA, but not glutamate, release. Using chemogenetics to bidirectionally modulate LHb, we found that LHb hyperpolarization shifted VTAGG effects toward excitation, abolishing positive reinforcement, whereas LHb depolarization enhanced net inhibition and positive reinforcement. Thus, the activity state of LHb neurons dictates whether GABA-glutamate corelease is functionally inhibitory or excitatory and can reverse the motivational valence of VTAGG input, supporting a homeostatic role for GABA-glutamate cotransmission with broad implications for disorders of imbalanced motivation.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Erk waves were proposed to result from an excitable system including feedback with Erk activators and inhibitors. Here, we characterize how Erk modulates its inhibitors, predicted to limit wave frequency and thus tissue growth. First, we found that Erk waves can form spirals, signature of excitable systems, and exhibit refractory behavior compatible with Erk inhibitors following Erk waves. Using a newly developed single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) technique for whole scales, we discovered that Erk waves induce trailing transcript waves of the inhibitors dusp5, spry2 and spry4 through Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) responses. Furthermore, we discovered that Erk waves modulate transcription of the gene osterix, which controls maturation of bone-forming cells.

This enzymatic cycling converts diffusion-limited localization into self-amplifying signal generation, enabling morphology imaging at concentrations as low as 100 pM and real-time tracking of Golgi dynamics within minutes at nanomolar levels. This probe requires minimal incubation time, exhibits negligible cytotoxicity, faithfully reports pharmacological Golgi disassembly, and functions in vivo in Drosophila larvae.

The safety and efficacy of these NK cells were assessed in vivo by treating ART-suppressed, HIV-infected-humanized-DRAGA mice following ART interruption. In vitro, CAR and control NK cells proliferated and killed HIV-Envelope-expressing cells. In vivo, there were no adverse health outcomes associated with cell infusions. CAR NK-treated animals had, on average, 1.88 times higher NK cell levels, and cells persisted up to 2 weeks longer than control NK-treated animals.

Angiotensin II (AngII) induces an increase of PAI-1 during the development of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA). The purpose of this study was to determine whether deletion of PAI-1 influenced the development of ATAA. Methods and Results: AngII was infused for 4 weeks in whole-body PAI-1 deficient (PAI-1-/-) mice and their wild-type littermates (PAI-1+/+) to examine the role of PAI-1 in ATAA. PAI-1 deficiency did not alter AngII-induced aortopathy but revealed a striking cardiac phenotype characterized by replacement fibrosis predominantly within the epicardium and posterior septum. Ferric iron, indicative of prior hemorrhage, was coincident with fibrosis. Similar phenotypes were observed in PAI-1-/- mice infused with norepinephrine for 4 weeks. To define the pathological events preceding cardiac fibrosis, either AngII or norepinephrine was infused for 1 week in PAI-1+/+ or -/- mice. Both infusions induced extensive epicardial hemorrhage and posterior septal fibrosis in PAI-1-/- mice. To explore the initiation of hemorrhage and fibrosis, mice were infused with AngII for approximately 1 day, resulting in diffuse hemorrhage and cardiomyocyte loss localized to the posterior septum of PAI-1-/- mice.

A central molecular battleground in this evolutionary arms race is the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), which must simultaneously maintain high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor while evading recognition by neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we construct and analyze multiple combinatorial libraries of SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants spanning major branches of Omicron evolution, including BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, XBB, and JN.1. Using high-throughput yeast display and binding assays, we map the effects of thousands of mutations and their combinations on ACE2 binding and antibody evasion. Our results reveal that while many RBD mutations exhibit additive effects, several mutations interact epistatically in a background-dependent manner. In particular, we identify synergistic interactions between BA.1 and BA.5 mutations that enhance antibody evasion, likely facilitating the rise of recombinant variants and convergent evolution. Conversely, some mutations show lineage-restricted compatibility, suggesting potential constraints on future evolutionary trajectories. Our comprehensive genotype-to-phenotype maps uncover both rugged and smooth regions of the viral fitness landscape and underscore the importance of epistasis in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Forest mortality is an autocorrelated phenomenon that results from a complex interplay between stressors and forest traits. Remote sensing enables us to measure forest mortality in different ways, including aerial surveys; changes in satellite imagery; and individual dead tree mapping in high-resolution imagery. We evaluated the role of autocorrelation and mortality data sources in forecasting drought and insect-induced forest mortality in the western United States. To achieve these objectives, we compared the performance of gradient-boosted regression models against naive autocorrelation models at continental and local scale. Further, we also evaluated bias and variability among observers in aerial surveys. At continental scale, we compared models trained on aerial surveys with a satellite-derived forest mortality dataset. At local scale, we compared models trained on aerial surveys with models trained on maps of individual dead trees. We found that gradient-boosted regression models slightly outperformed naive models across both scales. We also found that covariates related to autocorrelation were the primary drivers of mortality predictions and that model performance declined when they were excluded. This result was consistent across both scales of analysis and all mortality data sources. Furthermore, we found bias in aerial surveys where sites with prior-year mortality were re-surveyed more often than locations without mortality. Our findings showed that forest mortality forecasts based on remote sensing data are not sufficiently accurate to support forest management. To map future mortality risk, we advocate for scaling plot-level mortality models and incorporating accuracy assessments into aerial survey datasets.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Z.", "abstract": "Cellular morphological transitions are widely observed in many diseases; however, the functional role of these morphologies remains unclear, as most technologies are unable to profile both form and function simultaneously. However, computationally linking single-cell morphology and transcriptomics of neural cells is challenging due to a lack of feature correspondences. We present GeoAdvAE, a geometry-aware adversarial autoencoder for diagonal (unpaired) integration of single-cell morphology and single-cell RNA sequencing. GeoAdvAE combines modality-specific variational autoencoders with a Gromov-Wasserstein regularizer and an adversarial discriminator to embed unpaired morphologies and transcriptomes into a shared latent space, preserving both reconstruction fidelity and cross-modal geometry. To validate the correctness of integration, we leverage Patch-seq neurons with joint morphology-RNA measurements. Using these ground-truth pairings, GeoAdvAE achieves the best cross-modal cell-type matching accuracy compared to other diagonal integration methods, outperforming optimal transport, latent alignment, and adversarial baselines. We then apply GeoAdvAE to microglia from the 5xFAD mouse model, a model system of Alzheimer's disease. We integrate 98 CAJAL-quantified morphologies, spanning amoeboid and ramified forms, with 31,948 single-cell RNA-seq profiles across homeostatic, proliferating, and disease-associated states to recover a one-dimensional axis that aligns the two modalities. We uncover novel biology by using integrated gradient attribution, where we highlight transcriptomic shifts (DNA repair in ramified; cell killing in amoeboid) and nominate gene markers (Ms4a6b; Ftl1/Fth1) corresponding with morphological changes.

K.; Granek, J. A.", "abstract": "Sample multiplexing is a standard component of high-throughput sequencing, but it introduces a potential point of error. We identified a problem with sample multiplexing in Oxford Nanopore standard ligation-based barcoding protocol that results in a relatively high rate of read misassignment due to barcode crosstalk. This barcode crosstalk is particularly pernicious because it masquerades as sample cross-contamination. We have quantified the rate of read misassignment due to crosstalk. To address this problem we devised Post-Ligation Pooling, a simple protocol modification that reduces misassignment due to crosstalk by more than an order of magnitude. We have also compared Post-Ligation Pooling to the Short Fragment Buffer wash, an optional step recently introduced by Oxford Nanopore, and to a library preparation that combines Post-Ligation Pooling with the Short Fragment Buffer wash, which produces the lowest crosstalk. Our results highlight the need to recognize the potential for barcode crosstalk and use our modified protocol to mitigate it in when working in metagenomics, doing clinical assays, using low-DNA samples, and any other application where cross-contamination can produce misleading results.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Through analysis of kidney tissue from HCT recipients, we identified substantial acute tubular injury and T cell infiltration that correlated with extra-renal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) severity, linking systemic alloreactivity and post-transplant renal pathology. In murine models, GVHD was similarly associated with acute kidney injury, renal Th1-type T cell infiltration, and hyperactivation of NF-{kappa}B and JAK-STAT signaling. Notably, galectin-3, a damage-associated lectin, was upregulated in both patient biopsies and experimental GVHD target organs. Leveraging this pathological feature, we engineered galectin-3-targeted lipid nanoparticles for tissue-specific delivery of ruxolitinib, an approved GVHD therapy. Nanoparticle-delivered ruxolitinib substantially enhanced renal function, reduced systemic GVHD, and minimized hematologic toxicity compared to conventional drug administration. Our findings demonstrate renal involvement in acute GVHD and establish a nanoparticle-based strategy for precision delivery of immunomodulatory therapies.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

H.; Choi, Y.-L.", "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of cancer progression requires integrating tissue morphology with spatial molecular profiles. We present SHEST, a multi-task profiling framework that leverages haematoxylin and eosin morphology to predict cellular composition and reconstruct spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution. SHEST employs a quadruple-tile input capturing nuclear and contextual information, combined with a neighbourhood-informed clustering algorithm to filter ambiguous cellular signals. It comprises a shared morphological encoder with two task-specific heads: a classifier for cell type prediction and a reconstructor for gene expression. Multi-task optimisation uses cross-entropy and zero-inflated negative binomial losses, specifically addressing the sparsity of spatial transcriptomic data. Evaluation on human lung adenocarcinoma datasets demonstrated high accuracy for the principal reciprocal constituents of the tumour-immune axis (F1: 0.97 for tumour cells and 0.91 for lymphocytes). External validation confirmed its generalisability, revealing alveolar cells and their early neoplastic transitions. Reconstructed gene expression reproduced spatially resolved, cell-type-specific marker patterns--EPCAM in tumour cells, LTBP2 in fibroblasts, and CD3E in lymphocytes--recovering biologically coherent transcriptional architecture. SHEST also preserved distance-dependent spatial relationships and gene-level autocorrelation, reflecting the multicellular niche structure of the tumour microenvironment. By unifying cell type identification, gene expression reconstruction, and spatial mapping within a single interpretable framework, SHEST provides a synergistic and cost-efficient bridge between histopathology and spatial transcriptomics. This approach facilitates comprehensive tissue characterisation and forms a foundation for precision oncology through spatially informed, cell-level insights into tumour-immune ecosystems.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

Prior studies found that EML4-ALK, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) fusion oncoprotein, suppresses transmembrane receptor signaling through EGFR. Moreover, suppression was reversed with targeted ALK inhibition, thereby promoting survival and drug tolerance. Here we tested whether such modulation of EGFR was common among other RTK fusions, which collectively are found in ~5% of all cancers. Using live- and fixed-cell microscopy in isogenic and patient-derived cell lines, we found that a wide variety of RTK fusions suppress transmembrane EGFR and sequester essential adaptor proteins in the cytoplasm, as evidenced by the localization of endogenous Grb2. Targeted therapies rapidly released Grb2 from sequestration and potentiated EGFR. Synthetic optogenetic analogs of RTK fusions confirmed that cytoplasmic sequestration of Grb2 was sufficient to suppress perception of extracellular EGF and could do so without driving signaling from the synthetic fusion itself, demonstrating that fusion signaling and suppression of EGFR could be functionally decoupled. Our study uncovers that a large number of RTK fusions simultaneously act as both activators and suppressors of signaling, the mechanisms of which could be exploited for new biomimetic therapies that enhance cell killing and suppress drug tolerance.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

The VNO of rodents is populated by different types of Vomeronasal Sensory Neurons (VSNs). Apical VSNs, located near the lumen, express the transcription factor (TF) Meis2, V1R family receptors, and the G protein subunit Go, the VSNs distributed closer to the basal lamina express the TF Tfap2e/AP2{epsilon}, V2R receptors, and the G protein subunit Gi2. In addition, sparse cells in the VNO express the Formyl Peptide Receptors (FPRs). Single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA Seq) identified over 980 differentially expressed genes between these cell types, with many linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Among these ER proteins, Canopy1 (Cnpy1), was found to be among the most enriched genes in V2R+ VSNs. Previously studied only in zebrafish, Cnpy1 was found to affect Fgfr1 signaling and is thus also known as FGF signaling regulator-1. In a previous study, we discovered that AP-2{epsilon} upregulates Cnpy1 expression. Although Cnpy1 knockout mice are viable and have normal VNO development at birth, they experience a progressive degeneration and loss of V2R-expressing VSNs. Prior to symptoms, the basal VSNs of KO mice display reduced V2R protein immunoreactivity in the soma and a complete absence of the protein at the lumen of the VNO, rendering the neurons non-functional. Cnpy1 KOs exhibit altered guidance cues and adhesion molecule expression, along with disrupted connectivity to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB).

In this study, we present an artificial intelligence-guided de novo protein binder design strategy, utilizing compact protein binders as selective molecular probes to map hydrophobic O2 diffusion pathways in Escherichia coli hydrogenase-2 (Hyd-2). By integrating RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold, approximately 100,000 candidate binders were computationally screened, leading to the identification of two high-affinity binders, L1 and L2. Structural, biophysical, and electrochemical analyses reveal that L1 specifically occludes the primary O2 ingress channel, thereby enhancing the enzyme's oxygen tolerance by more than threefold, whereas L2, which targets a putative secondary channel, exerts a negligible effect, demonstrating the nonfunctionality of this pathway. These results provide the first direct experimental evidence for a hierarchical organization of O2 diffusion channels in [NiFe]-hydrogenases and establish binder-mediated channel occlusion as a generalizable, mutation-free approach for probing gas transport mechanisms and selectivity in metalloenzymes.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

The Rayleigh quotient is {rho}PCA, satisfies numerous desirable properties, and provides an interpretable form of dimension reduction via generalized eigenvectors. We demonstrate that {rho}PCA is more accurate than contrastive PCA and much more efficient.

This study confirmed the growth-promoting effects of MAA and its fermentation supernatant on rice. Based on single-factor and response surface methodology experiments, the fermentation conditions of MAA were subsequently optimized using rice root length as a key indicator, and the potential mechanisms behind this growth promotion were preliminarily investigated. The results demonstrated that both MAA and its fermentation supernatant exerted significant growth-promoting effects on rice. Sucrose and peptone were identified as the optimal carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The most pronounced effect was observed when the fermentation supernatant, produced under the conditions of pH 6.0, 0.2% {beta}-Ala, and 100 umol/L Al2(SO4)3, was applied, resulting in a 21.7% increase in rice root length compared to the control group.

There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for Mab disease. Existing treatment strategies using repurposed drugs are prolonged, complex, and yield low cure rates (30-50%), underscoring the urgent need for more effective therapeutics. Developing new treatments requires preclinical disease models that faithfully replicate human disease, and the choice of Mab strain is a key determinant of model relevance. The commonly used reference strain, ATCC 19977, was isolated from a non-pulmonary source but became the default due to its early availability. To evaluate its relevance for pulmonary disease modeling, we compared ATCC 19977 with 15 clinical Mab isolates derived from lung infections across diverse regions of the United States. In both in vitro assays and a validated mouse lung infection model, ATCC 19977 behavior differed from the clinical isolates for key traits including rapid systemic dissemination, failure to develop robust lung granulomas, and early mortality. In contrast, clinical isolates demonstrated greater pulmonary tropism and reduced dissemination, with several producing robust lung pathology. Based on these findings, we propose a set of pulmonary clinical isolates representing the major Mab subspecies for use in lung infection research. These isolates more accurately recapitulate the pathological features of human Mab lung disease and are expected to enhance the translational value of future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.", "date": "2025-11-19", "journal": ""}

We analyzed proteins from 17 fermented foods using metaproteomics to identify and quantify microbial and food-derived proteins. We found that microbial proteins contribute up to 11% of the total protein content in fermented foods and comprise as much as 60% of the total number of identified proteins. These microbial proteins included many for central functions in microbial cells, such as glycolysis enzymes, translation machinery, and chaperones, as well as proteins for specialized functions that are important for the ecological niches in food fermentation, such as carbohydrate degrading enzymes and proteases.

The introduction of a novel rewarded stimulus resulted in a rapid modification of population activity that featured abrupt alterations in single neuron selectivity. Vm recordings revealed that both naturally occurring and experimentally-induced dendritic calcium plateau potentials (plateaus) rapidly alter the action potential (APs) output and Vm dynamics of neurons over many seconds of time around the plateau, in some cases from one trial to the next. Trains of high frequency APs had no effect.

The mode of origin of a polyploid lineage is a continuum, ranging from whole genome duplication (WGD) from within the same species (autopolyploidy), to a WGD derived from hybridization between two (or more) distinct species (allopolyploidy). The polyploid mode of origin impacts many aspects of genome evolution, including patterns of chromosomal inheritance, homeologous exchange rate, and post-WGD diploidization. Here, we develop a novel polyploid genome simulation engine DemographiKS to demonstrate that the Ks histogram, one of the most broadly utilized methods for inferring WGD events, is highly sensitive to evolutionary parameters relating to the mode of origin, as well as demographic parameters such as migration events, population bottlenecks and expansions. Our results show that that the location of the Ks peak may correspond to the time of parental divergence (for allopolyploids); might be hidden at Ks=0 (for autopolyploids under a population contraction); may correspond to the mean time of coalescence of the diploid ancestor (for autopolyploids under a population expansion), or the time of most recent migration between the parental species (for allopolyploids). We also fit simulated Ks histograms to polyploid genomes from four well-studied plant lineages on the polyploid continuum (Coffea arabica, Zea mays, Populus trichocarpa, and Saccharum spontaneum), demonstrating that WGD simulations may be used to corroborate inferred demographies.
