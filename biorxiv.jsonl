F.", "abstract": "Repeated cycles of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal induce profound changes in gene expression that can contribute to the physiological and behavioral consequences of ethanol. Since neuroinflammation is an important consequence of these changes, we used a novel strategy to investigate the impact of repeated cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor and withdrawal on the RNAs actively undergoing translation in microglia in striatum, a key region involved in the relapse to ethanol consumption. We performed deep sequencing of the \"translatome\" from striatal microglia of male and female RiboTag mice, yielding a snapshot of RNA translation during alcohol intoxication and after 8 hours of withdrawal. Chronic intermittent ethanol produced robust changes in the translatome, with increases in genes and pathways associated with cytokine signaling, indicating increased neuroinflammation and microglial activation. After 8 hours of ethanol withdrawal, many inflammatory pathways remained upregulated and phagocytotic and proapoptotic pathways were increased. Using unbiased network analysis, we identified gene modules that were differentially expressed in ethanol intoxicated vs. withdrawing animals. Genes associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR) were over-represented in one such module after withdrawal, including the transcription factor Ddit3 (CHOP), an important mediator of the UPR. We tested the impact of conditional knockout of CHOP from microglia specifically; following withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol, these mice had reduced thermoregulatory disturbances, anxiety-like behavior, and voluntary ethanol consumption compared to wild-type littermates. We conclude that CHOP and the UPR in microglia may be important targets for reducing the impact of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

In allergic responses, the high-affinity IgE receptor, Fc{epsilon}RI, is activated when multivalent antigens crosslink receptor-bound IgE, yet the molecular mechanisms linking antigen structure to signaling output remain incompletely understood. Here, we compare two antigens presenting identical IgE-binding haptens but differing in geometry: the high-valency, structurally heterogeneous DNP-BSA and the defined trivalent antigen DF3. We find that these ligands elicit distinct patterns of degranulation and Fc{epsilon}RI {gamma}-chain phosphorylation, correlating with differences in the recruitment of the inhibitory lipid phosphatase SHIP1. Monte Carlo simulations predicted that each antigen generates receptor aggregates with distinct size, complexity, and inter-receptor spacing. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) and Bayesian Grouping of Localizations (BaGoL) analysis, we directly visualized the nanoscale aggregate geometry and found that DF3 induced smaller, more linear aggregates with tighter receptor spacing than DNP-BSA. Together, our results show that antigen properties, including size, valency, and epitope spacing, modulate Fc{epsilon}]RI aggregate architecture and tune the balance of positive and negative signaling to ultimately shape mast cell outcomes.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Classical timer models for cell proliferation (where the duration of the cell cycle is an independent variable) predict that the stochastic variation in colony size will increase monotonically over time. In stark contrast, implementing size control according to adder strategy (where on average a fixed size added from cell birth to division) leads to colony size variations that eventually decay to zero. While these results assume a fixed size of the colony-initiating progenitor cell, further analysis reveals that the magnitude of the intercolony variation in population number is sensitive to heterogeneity in the initial cell size. We validate these predictions by tracking the growth of isogenic microcolonies of Corynebacterium glutamicum in microfluidic chambers. Approximating their cell shape to a capsule, we observe that the degree of random variability in cell size is different depending on whether the cell size is quantified as per length, surface area, or volume, but size control remains an adder regardless of these size metrics. A comparison of the observed variability in the colony population with the predictions suggests that proliferation matches better with a cell division based on the cell surface. In summary, our integrated mathematical-experimental approach bridges the paradigms of single-cell size regulation and clonal expansion at the population levels. This innovative approach provides elucidation of the mechanisms of size homeostasis from the stochastic dynamics of colony size for rod-shaped microbes.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

To test the hypothesis that environmental cues shape strategies fish use to control posture, we leveraged a serendipitous finding: larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) lose swim bladder volume and sink mildly after acute loss of lateral line hair cells. Using long-term (48 h) recordings of unrestrained swimming, we discovered that sinking larvae compensated differently depending on light conditions. In the dark, they swim more frequently with an increased nose-up posture. In contrast, larvae in the light do not swim more frequently, but do climb more often. Finally, after lateral line regeneration, larvae returned to normal buoyancy and swam comparably to control siblings. We conclude that larvae can switch postural control strategies depending on the availability of visual information.

Here, we used structure-function analyses to identify eight PTSP-interacting residues in the ligand binding pocket that are required for PTSP inhibition of Vibrio vulnificus SmcR. Binding of PTSP to SmcR drives allosteric unfolding of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and, in this state, SmcR is degraded by the ClpAP protease. SmcR degradation controls the timing of the phenotypic switch between high and low cell density, and strains expressing degradation-resistant smcR alleles are impervious to changes in cell density state.

We show that DREAM abundance is under circadian control with high levels seen during wakefulness. DREAM elevation confers increased chromatin compaction and shields DNA from damage while altering fundamental cellular processes such as translation, stress responses and OXPHOS. Conversely, DREAM levels are lowered during sleep enabling cellular maintenance and repair. When sleep or clock are altered, DREAM levels remain high, and repair activities remain suppressed triggering cellular and organismal deterioration that can be reversed by genetic and pharmacological inhibition of DREAM in vivo and in vitro.

Apart from CNA, other mechanisms could lead to imbalanced mRNA expression of the alleles, and similarly drive cancer evolution by epistatic interactions with the somatic mutations. By integrating genomic and transcriptomic pan-cancer data, we show that mRNA allelic imbalance favoring the mutant allele in driver genes is subject to positive selection, generating second-hit events often independently of somatic CNA. In some cases, the somatic coding mutations could induce allele-specific expression directly, e.g. with splicing-altering exonic mutations, which can be selected in various cancer genes. However, in the majority of cases, these and related somatic mutation effects (which might in principle alter transcription output via impacting promoters or intragenic enhancers) do not explain the CNA-independent mRNA-level AI, suggesting prevalent epigenetic alterations affecting alleles differently in tumors. Importantly, the mRNA AI events associate with worse overall survival across all cancer types, outperforming various other predictive markers. Our study suggests that mRNA allelic imbalances can occur independently of CNA but similarly function as second-hit events to somatic mutations, driving tumorigenesis, and so represent valuable prognostic biomarkers for cancer patient stratification.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

In the present study, we review the occurrence of mimicry in the family of corvids and investigate the socio-ecological factors driving the evolution of vocal mimicry in this group of birds. We recorded evidence of vocal mimicry from primary (xeno-canto recordings) as well as secondary sources (published literature) and found evidence for vocal mimicry in 39 out of 128 corvid species (30%). Socio-ecological factors like breeding status, habitat and trophic niche did not have a significant effect. We used Bayesian modelling based on existing data from primary and secondary sources to estimate the occurrence of mimicry, suggesting that vocal mimicry may be more widespread among corvids than currently documented, with many species potentially being 'hidden mimics '. Our study for the first time systematically reviews the occurrence of vocal mimicry across the family of corvids and investigates a range of socio-ecological factors driving the behaviour, hopefully inspiring future field work on those species.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

A recent theoretical model has proposed that out-of-equilibrium central dogma reactions involving mRNA and ribosomes play a significant role in this process. Here we test this idea in the Escherichia coli model system using high-throughput fluorescence microscopy in microfluidic devices. We compare our experimental observations with predictions from a reaction-diffusion model that includes central dogma-related reactions and excluded volume interactions between ribosomal subunits, polysomes, and chromosomal DNA. Our results show that the non-equilibrium reactions of ribosomes cause them to aggregate at the midcell, and this process facilitates the separation of the two daughter chromosomes. However, the observed effects are weaker in live cells than our one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model predicts. Rather than relying solely on active mRNA-ribosome dynamics, our data suggest that the closing division septum via steric interactions and potentially entropic forces between two DNA strands coupled to cell elongation act as additional mechanisms to ensure faithful partitioning of the nucleoids to two daughter cells.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Although GPCRs have been relatively well characterized in metazoans, GPCR signaling is poorly understood in their sister group, the choanoflagellates, and in other close relatives of metazoans (CRMs). Here, we examine GPCR diversity and evolution in choanoflagellates by curating a catalog of 918 GPCRs, 141 G proteins, and 367 associated regulators from 23 choanoflagellate genomes and transcriptomes. We found that the repertoire of choanoflagellate GPCRs is larger and more diverse than previously anticipated, with 18 GPCR families found in choanoflagellates, of which 12 families are newly identified in these organisms. Comparative analyses revealed that most choanoflagellate GPCR families are conserved in metazoans and/or other eukaryotic lineages. Adhesion GPCRs and a class of GPCRs fused to kinases (the GPCR-TKL/Ks) are the most abundant GPCRs in choanoflagellates. The identification of GPCR repertoires in CRMs and other non-metazoans refines our understanding of metazoan GPCR evolution and reveals the existence of previously unreported GPCR families in metazoans and at the root of the eukaryotic tree.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Duty-cycle subsampling is widely used to collect PAM data at regular ON/OFF cycles to circumvent battery and storage capacity constraints for long-term monitoring. However, the impact of duty-cycle subsampling and potential detector errors on estimating bat activity has not been systematically investigated for bats. Here, we simulate the influence of duty-cycle subsampling in measuring bat activity via three metrics - Call Rate (CR), Activity Index (AI), and Bout-Time Percentage (BTP) - using three months of continuous recordings spanning summer to fall in a temperate urban natural area. Our simulations show that subsampled bat activity estimates more accurately track true values when the listening ratio is high and the cycle length is low, when the true call activity is high, or when recorded calls have lower frequency content. Generally, among the three metrics, AI provides the best subsampling estimates and is robust against false negatives but sensitive to false positives, whereas BTP provides better temporal resolution compared to AI and is robust against both false positives and false negatives.

We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires \"gauge-fixing,\" i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to L_2-regularized regression in an overparameterized \"weight space'' where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in \"function space,'' i.e. the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges and characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers. Finally, we derive the posterior distribution of a broad class of sequence-to-function statistics, including gauge-fixed weights and multiple systems for expressing higher-order epistatic coefficients.

In small animals such as insects, the contribution of passive forces to limb movement can match the active forces. However, most measurements of passive forces are limited to the femur-tibia joint in large insects. Here we take advantage of genetic tools in Drosophila to measure passive torques at multiple joints in the flys leg. We genetically inactivate all the motor neurons to assess passive forces. We find that the passive torques are well approximated by a linear spring, i.e., the passive torques linearly increase with angular deviation from the rest angle. The torques are much larger than the gravitational torque due to the leg itself. We estimate that the passive torques are seventy times smaller than necessary to support the weight of the animal. We also inactivated all the motor neurons in a freely standing fly and found that, as predicted from the model, the fly falls when the motor neurons are inactivated. We found that the height at which a fly stands, and, therefore the active forces vary. The flys height affects the time to initiate a fall. The time it takes for the fall is consistent with the active forces decaying with a time constant of ~100 ms. Thus, although passive forces are strong and will have a large effect on limb kinematics, they are not strong enough to support the weight of the fly.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

To overcome this, we leveraged a heteroplasmic mouse model and discovered that mitochondrial heteroplasmy affects a fundamental developmental process. Specifically, the differentiation of osteoclasts, which resorb bone tissue and maintain bone homeostasis. Mechanistically, there was a reduced localization of specifically respiratory complex I subunits in mitochondria in heteroplasmic mice, disrupting ATP production and osteoclast differentiation. In addition, autophagic flux is exhausted, and the autophagy inducer spermidine restores mitochondrial health and rescues osteoclast activity, both in mice and in cells from patients with primary mitochondrial disease.

B.", "abstract": "Background: Patients living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLWH) develop accelerated liver fibrosis, but the exact mechanism remains unknown. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is the cornerstone for liver fibrosis and influenced by multiple factors, such as viral infection, hepatocellular injury, chronic immune activation, gut mucosal barrier dysfunction, and microbial translocation. Unlike gram-negative bacterial products, the impact of gram-positive microbial products in Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) associated liver inflammation and fibrosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major gram-positive bacterial component, on HSCs in the context of HIV-1 infection. Methods: Human HSCs were isolated from the livers of both non-HIV and HIV-infected patients undergoing hepatic resection. The inflammatory responses of HSCs to LTA stimulation were measured by ELISA before or after HIV-1BaL ex vivo expision. Western blotting, ChIP-qPCR and RNA-seq were used to reveal the mechanisms contributing to the IL-8 response to LTA stimulation and HIV-1BaL exposure in HSCs. Results: While LTA stimulation modestly increased IL-8 production in HSCs, this effect was significantly amplified in HIV-1-infected HSCs. Elevated IL-8 levels were detected in HIV-1+ liver sections, and IL-8 treatment of cultured HSCs significantly increased -SMA and COL1A1 expression, supporting IL-8 as a key inflammatory driver of liver fibrosis in HIV-1+ individuals. Transcriptomic analyses implicated histone acetylation as a regulator of the enhanced IL-8 response of HSCs to LTA in HIV-1 infection. Consistent with this, treatment with Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, further increased the IL-8 response in HIV-1-infected HSCs. ChIP-qPCR confirmed that histone H4K5 acetylation facilitated IL-8 promoter transactivation, rendering HIV-1-infected cells more responsive to LTA. Conclusions: HIV-1 infection sensitizes HSCs to LTA stimulation, leading to an amplified IL-8 response mediated through histone acetylation that may accelerate liver fibrosis progression in PLWH. As microbial translocation persists despite effective antiretroviral therapy, these findings underscore the need for targeted strategies to mitigate liver fibrosis in HIV-1 infected HIV-1+ individuals.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

As APY formation occurs without an enzyme, it remains exceptionally difficult to pinpoint where APY is likely to be found, both on individual proteins and in cells. In this study, we used a peptide model system and mass spectrometry analysis to investigate the chemical mechanism through which APY forms from methylglyoxal (MGO), a biologically relevant glycating agent. Consistent with other proposed APY formation mechanisms, our results show that that another AGE, tetrahydropyrimidine (THP) is a direct precursor to APY. However, our results rule out previously proposed reductone or oxidative decarboxylation mechanisms. Instead, we show that a formal oxidation step is not required, and that formate, not CO2 is released. We further show the potential for a nearby residue such as Tyr to assist in the APY formation mechanism by acting as a general base. These experiments revealed that phosphorylated Tyr or Ser residues could also promote equivalent levels of APY formation, despite introducing additional negative charges that we previously showed to impede glycation. Guided by these mechanistic insights and newly defined role for phosphorylated residues on glycation substrates, we performed quantitative bottom-up proteomics analysis for MGO-treated cells. Gene ontology analysis for AGE-modified proteins revealed significant enrichment of phosphorylation-related terms (e.g. kinase activity or protein phosphorylation) for APY, while other Arg post-translational modifications did not. Collectively, these data define a chemical mechanistic path to APY and suggest significant crosstalk between cellular phosphorylation and glycation events including APY formation.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Although heterogeneous in its manifestations and severity, SLE involves chronic inflammation along with sustained autoantibody production. The root causes and pathophysiology of the inflammation and breaches of tolerance are incompletely understood, but neutrophils are thought to be important elements of the pathophysiology. Type I interferons (IFN) in the bloodstream and an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signature in circulating leukocytes, including neutrophils, are common features in many patients. Earlier work with unfractionated peripheral blood cells of SLE patients has provided evidence of increased levels of transcripts derived from transposable elements (TEs). We sought to elucidate the relative extents of de-repression of different TE classes in neutrophils of SLE patients, and to explore the relationships between the increased ISG and TE expression as well as their correlation with the severity of the SLE disease. Published RNA-seq data obtained from neutrophils (also termed polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or PMN) were analyzed with pipelines designed to detect TEs in samples from 23 patients with SLE and healthy controls (n = 10). SLE samples were sub-divided into \"IFN-positive\" (IFNpos, n=12) and \"IFN-negative\" (IFNneg, n=11) patients, as defined in the original study based on gene expression analysis. An independent interferon-regulated gene signature was also determined for each sample. In PMN of IFNpos SLE patients, expression of ISGs and TE families were increased compared to healthy controls (HC) and IFNneg SLE patients. No TE families showed significantly increased expression in SLE patients pre-stratified as IFNneg. Increased expression of a majority of individually-mapped TEs correlated with upregulated expression of nearby genes. The majority (~80%) of upregulated TEs were present in introns of upregulated genes, and ~67% of these upregulated genes were ISGs. Of the ~20% of mapped TEs that were in the introns of genes whose expression did not change significantly, only ~28% were ISGs. Analyses of all SLE patients identified a strong correlation between expression of several specific TE families and disease activity assessed at the time of the visit. Detailed inspection of individually mapped TEs in the introns of ISGs showed a remarkable correlation of high TE expression with selective but partial intron retention as well as with annotated splicing alterations of the flanking exons in these ISGs. Neutrophils of SLE patients independently pre-classified as being IFNpos have increased expression of multiple TE classes and families, but this manifestation is not present in patients of the IFNneg stratum. The expression of only some TE families correlated with the disease activity, showing a complex relationship between TEs and SLE. The findings suggest a mechanistic relationship between the degree of IFN response and increased TE expression in a cell type centrally involved in SLE pathogenesis. The presence of highly expressed TEs in ISG introns, and the correlation of TE expression levels with partial intron retention and with splicing variations in adjacent exons, are unexpected findings that need to be further explored.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

The combination of large language models (LLMs) with advanced deep contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) for aligning text with images has revolutionized neuroimaging meta-analysis, potentially offering solutions to functional decoding challenges. In this work, we present NiCLIP, a contrastive language-image pretrained model that predicts cognitive tasks, concepts, and domains from brain activation patterns. We leveraged over 23,000 neuroscientific articles to train a CLIP model for text-to-brain association. We demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., BrainGPT models) outperform their base LLM counterparts. Evaluation of NiCLIP predictions revealed that performance is optimized when using full-text articles instead of abstracts, as well as a curated cognitive ontology with precise task-concept-domain mappings. Our results indicated that NiCLIP accurately predicts cognitive tasks from group-level activation maps provided by the Human Connectome Project across multiple domains (e.g., emotion, language, motor) and precisely characterizes the functional roles of specific brain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and temporoparietal junction.

Nav1.1 is expressed in the brain and at a lower level, in the heart. The disease manifests in the first year of life. Patients exhibit tonic-clonic seizures, febrile seizures, cognitive decline, development delays, ataxia, and in some cases sudden unexpected death from epilepsy (SUDEP). Here we have developed a novel AAV-F mediated CRISPR-Cas-inspired RNA targeting system (CIRTS) pre-clinical treatment to increase endogenous Scn1a to ameliorate the disease phenotype in a clinically relevant heterozygous loss of function mouse model of DS. We designed novel guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target the long non-coding RNA, (or natural antisense transcript) of Scn1a to increase the expression of Scn1a mRNA in DS mice. We show that intracerebroventricular and intravenous administration of AAV-F-CIRTS-gRNA9 to target the brain and the heart to neonatal Scn1a+/- mice resulted significant increase in survival and a reduction in SUDEP and spontaneous seizures. Furthermore, we have shown increased expression of endogenous Scn1a in treated AAV-F-CIRTS-gRNA9 Scn1a+/- mice. These findings provide proof of concept evidence that an AAV-F-CIRTS mediated therapy hold promise as a potential long-term treatment for DS.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5 on accuracy and precision on diverse datasets. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrate published and new single-cell RNA sequencing data of plaque mesenchymal cells from human carotid and coronary arteries, pig aorta and coronary arteries, and mouse brachiocephalic arteries. By applying consensus across multiple integration and gene homology-matching strategies, we identify a conserved core continuum of mesenchymal plaque cells, ranging from SMCs to extracellular matrix-producing fibroblast-like cells, which is stable across species and vascular beds. Notably, several other populations differed between human and experimental lesions. Subpopulations of SMCs marked by DLX5 and RERGL expression were specific to human carotid and coronary plaques, respectively. Mesenchymal cell states with strong pro-angiogenic and inflammation-associated gene signatures were identified in pig, but not human, coronary plaque datasets, with the pro-angiogenic phenotype associated with early stages of necrotic core development. Pericytes were solely present in pig and human plaques, while chondrocyte-like cells were unique to mouse lesions.

Here, we present a workflow combining optimized sample preparation, super-resolution imaging and quantitative bioimage analysis to investigate the nanoscale organization of NETs. Our newly developed analysis tool, NanoNET, facilitated the automated identification of DNA filaments and the analyses of NET binding proteins along those filaments through auto- and cross-correlation. We identify specific NET proteins, including neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase 3 (PR3), that are bound along DNA strands in a periodic fashion that mirrored nucleosomes. Cross-correlation of NE and PR3 with nucleosomes revealed that these proteins were highly colocalized suggesting that they dock onto or around nucleosomes. The presented workflow and analysis tools represent a significant methodological advance for studying protein distributions along NETs and along filamentous structures in general.

HD is increasingly appreciated to emerge from multiple pathogenic processes, including somatic instability in mutant HTT's (mHTT) CAG repeat tract, which leads to diverse deleterious consequences. These include the alternative processing of HTT pre-mRNA to generate the HTT1a transcript that encodes the very toxic, mHTT isoform referred to as HTT1a. We set out to compare the efficacy and safety of allele-selective lowering of mHTT compared to non-allele-selective lowering using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in heterozygous HttQ111 (Q111) mice. We developed a mutant specific ASO (MutASO) targeting Htt intron-1 that selectively reduced mutant full-length HTT, as well as HTT1a, in the brains of Q111 mice. Compared to the rescue provided by a pan-allele-targeting ASO (PanASO) that lowers wild-type HTT and full-length mHTT (sparing HTT1a), the MutASO essentially eliminated aggregate formation, and provided marked protection from transcriptional dysregulation in HD knock-in mice. Thus, by targeting the ASO to the region upstream of the cryptic polyadenylation sites required to generate the HTT1a transcript, our allele-selective MutASO potently reduced HTT1a protein levels. Here, our findings advocate that HTT1a may have a disproportionate impact on aggregate formation and transcriptional dysregulation and that lowering the levels of HTT1a could provide benefit when designing HTT-lowering based therapeutic strategies for HD.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

While therapeutic approaches targeting the disease-causing abnormal protein, progerin, have been developed, further efforts to explore mechanistically distinct and complementary strategies are still critical to better treatment regimens. We previously showed that lentiviral vector-driven expression of {Delta}133p53, a natural inhibitory isoform of p53, rescued HGPS patients-derived fibroblasts from early entry into cellular senescence, which is a downstream event of progerin-induced DNA damage. We also performed a quantitative high-throughput screen (qHTS) of approved drug and investigational agent libraries, leading to the identification of celastrol and AZD1981 as compounds that upregulate {Delta}133p53 protein levels. Methods: To investigate whether celastrol and ADZ1981 upregulate endogenous {Delta}133p53 in HGPS-derived fibroblasts and reduce their senescence-associated phenotypes, we performed western blot assays ({Delta}133p53, progerin, and p21WAF1, which mediates p53-induced senescence and is inhibited by {Delta}133p53), senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase (SA-{beta}-gal) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IL-6, which is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted from senescent cells), and qRT-PCR assays (p21WAF1 and IL-6). Results: Treatment with celastrol (0.1 M for 24 h) or AZD1981 (10 M for 24 h) reproducibly increased {Delta}133p53 expression and decreased p21WAF1 expression in two strains of fibroblasts derived from HGPS patients. These compounds reduced the percentage of SA-{beta}-gal-positive senescent cells and the secretion of IL-6 into culture medium in both of these fibroblast strains, irrespective of their different basal levels of senescence and IL-6 secretion. These compounds had no effect on the level of progerin. Conclusion: Celastrol and ADZ1981 upregulate endogenous {Delta}133p53 and, reproducing the effects of its vector-driven expression, inhibit cellular senescence and IL-6 secretion in HGPS-derived fibroblasts. Their progerin-independent action suggests that they may synergize with currently available progerin-targeting therapies. This study also warrants further investigation of these compounds for potential applications in other diseases and conditions in which {Delta}133p53-regulated senescence plays a role.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

We show that effector cells (motor neurons, endocrine cells and efferent neurons targeting the viscera) are primarily influenced by local sensory cells in the same body part, forming local feedback loops. These local loops are linked by long-range circuits involving ascending and descending neurons organized into behavior-centric modules. Single ascending and descending neurons are often positioned to influence the voluntary movement of multiple body parts, together with endocrine cells or visceral organs that support those movements.

However, when human cortical neurons reach functional electrophysiological maturity and how their developmental trajectory compares to other species remains unknown. Here we show through patch-clamp recordings of human temporal cortex from infancy to adulthood that supragranular pyramidal neurons exhibit pronounced neoteny of their functional properties, with physiological maturation continuing well into adulthood. Comparing human and mouse developmental trajectories reveals human neurons are on a much slower developmental timeline, maturing physiologically hundreds of times slower than mouse and 2-6 times slower than would be predicted from anatomical brain growth differences between species. This reflects a fundamentally different allometric relationship between physiological and anatomical maturation; while mouse neuronal physiology closely tracks brain growth, human physiological development follows its own extended timeline. This slow maturation results in different stages of cognitive development being supported by functionally distinct neuronal populations, with the progression from infancy to middle age characterized by specific electrophysiological profiles. Notably, a neuronal subtype thought to be human-specific, with electrophysiological traits that enhance computational capacity, appears only in late adolescence or early adulthood. This extreme protraction of neurophysiological development provides a cellular basis for prolonged human cognitive maturation, demonstrating that neuronal physiological neoteny represents a fundamental evolutionary adaptation in human brain development.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Despite recent advances, key knowledge gaps remain in understanding the molecular mechanisms of disease progression, which would support the development of early detection methods and effective personalized treatments. We apply integrated multi-omics and spatial analyses in a cohort of 49 bladder cancer patients to comprehensively profile genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and spatial features of bladder cancer, alongside cell-free DNA blood analysis. Combining low-pass whole-genome cell-free DNA sequencing, Oxford Nanopore long-read tumor DNA sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics, we provide insights into molecular alterations driving bladder cancer. We show frequent somatic LINE-1 (L1) insertions, with up to more than 500 insertions per tumor. We find that L1 insertions are active and occur early in bladder cancer development. We link aberrant somatic L1 insertion in bladder cancer with downstream genomic rearrangements and chromosomal instability, with an excess of structural variants and extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in patients with particularly high L1 counts. By detecting ecDNA within tissue architecture using spatial transcriptomics, we identify the localization of ecDNA to distinct spatial clusters with differential expression of APOBEC3B and immune response pathways. These results, combined with replication timing analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), offer evidence for the previously hypothesized viral mimicry response to L1 retrotransposition, mediated via APOBEC3B-editing, the cGAS-STING pathway, and RIG-I and MDA5 responses.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

A.; Simon, A. L.; Warner, D.; Bruce, T. J. A.; Ray, R. V.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) is a vector of Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) infecting major cereals including wheat. Recently, a winter wheat variety (G1) was identified as exhibiting significant aphid resistance through antixenosis and antibiosis. This study compares resistance to viruliferous aphids, and BYDV transmission, in G1 with RGT Wolverine and RGT Illustrious, a BYDV resistant and susceptible wheat varieties, respectively. We aimed to define how aphid resistance affects BYDV transmission, infection and spread. RESULTS: Seedling choice and olfactometer bioassays using wheat volatile organic compounds revealed that G1 emits an aphid repellent compound, identified as 2-tridecanone using GC-MS. Electrical penetration graph recordings showed restricted phloem access and salivation of viruliferous R. padi in G1, associated with lower BYDV transmission efficiency. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed a three-fold reduction in BYDV gene expression ratio on G1 transmission leaves compared to RGT Wolverine or RGT Illustrious. In contrast, reduced systemic infection in RGT Wolverine implied a BYDV resistance mechanism of limiting viral replication and/or movement. Rearing aphids on the aphid or BYDV resistant varieties modified their host selection behaviours suggesting vector conditioning with implications for viral transmission and spread on susceptible hosts. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the aphid resistance in G1 reduced BYDV transmission. Contrastingly, RGT Wolverine appeared to limit systemic viral infection despite high transmission efficiency. Combining these two distinct resistance mechanisms by breeding offers valuable strategy against both the aphid and the virus. To further define aphid and BYDV defence responses in G1, transcriptomic and metabolomic studies will be required.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

The reason for this increased susceptibility remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate bacterial burden and serum cytokine levels in septic neonatal mice born to dams with malnutrition. Methods: 6-week-old C57BL/6 dams were placed on a low-fat (LFD) (10% kcal from fat), control (CD) (18% kcal from fat), or high-fat (HFD) (60% kcal from fat) diet for 3 weeks prior to breeding. Sepsis was induced in P4-P6 offspring via intraperitoneal Staphylococcus epidermidis injection. Mice were monitored for survival. At 12h after sepsis, serum and peritoneal wash fluid were collected for bacterial count and serum cytokine levels. In the absence of infection, P4-P6 offspring had untargeted serum metabolomics performed. Results: Septic offspring of dams fed LFD and HFD had significantly higher mortality than offspring of dams fed CD. There was no difference in serum or peritoneal wash bacterial loads. Maternal diet and Staphylococcus epidermidis sepsis caused changes in basal serum cytokine levels, with HFD causing decreased cytokine elevation during sepsis. Maternal LFD and HFD altered similar metabolomic pathways in offspring.

Murine {beta}-TC-6 and human EndoC-{beta}H1 cell lines were genetically edited using CRISPR-Cas9 to knockout RNLS or HIVEP2, and editing efficiencies were confirmed via T7 endonuclease I assay and TIDE analysis.

This revealed significant methodological diversity and associated variability in the stress-stretch results, underscoring the necessity for a standardized approach. In the second round, a consensus protocol was collaboratively developed and adopted by 19 labs in an attempt to minimize variability. This involved standardized sample preparation and uniformity in testing protocol, including the use of a common cutting and thickness measurement tool.

It comprises a pair of homologous nucleotide-binding domains each containing a consensus nucleotide-binding site (NBS), where ATP hydrolysis takes place. Each of these sites can be either in an open or closed conformation. Despite this near symmetry, and quite unexpectedly, their hydrolysis kinetics are highly asymmetric. While substitution of the catalytic glutamate (E238Q) in NBSI reduced the overall turnover rate of the ATPase by a factor of two, as one might expect, the corresponding substitution in NBSII (E485Q) shows a so far unexplained tenfold increase. To address this issue, we used Markov models to study how such drastic asymmetry can arise. Specifically, we asked if previously proposed direct allosteric interaction between the two nucleotide-binding sites, such as electrostatic interactions, are required to explain this observation. Indeed, using a Bayesian approach, we found Markov models that quantitatively predict the experimentally observed kinetics as well as additional steady-state ATP occupancy data without such direct allosteric interaction. In particular, our results show that the structure-induced property that opening and closing always involves both nucleotide-binding sites suffices to explain the observed remarkable asymmetry. These models can explain the unexpected fast kinetics of the mutant of NBSII in terms of a drastic population shift due to the mutation, which circumvents a kinetic trap state that slows down wild-type kinetics. Our Baysian Markov approach may help to quantitatively explain similar non-intuitive Braess-type kinetics also in other enzymes where chemical/conformation coupling is essential.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Although environmental risk factors such as alcohol and gallstones are well recognized, only a subset of exposed individuals develop AP, suggesting that intrinsic factors, including genetic susceptibility, influence disease onset and progression. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has emerged as a key mechanism in AP pathogenesis, because ER is essential for protein synthesis, folding, degradation and secretion (proteostasis). Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), an ER stress-inducible protein highly expressed in the pancreas, plays a critical role in maintaining proteostasis, yet its involvement in AP remains unclear. To investigate the functional role of MANF in AP, we generated pancreas-specific MANF knockout (MANF-KO) mice using the Cre/loxP system and subjected them to moderate experimental AP, that is caerulein- or alcohol-induced AP in mice. In the caerulein model, MANF deficiency exacerbated pancreatic injury in both sexes, as indicated by increased apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3, caspase-12), ER stress markers (eIF2, p-eIF2, GRP78), inflammation (IL-6, TNF), regenerative activity (Ki67), and pancreatic lipase levels. Notably, male MANF-KO mice exhibited enhanced inflammation (HMGB1), macrophage infiltration (CD68), and oxidative stress (DNP, HNE), which were not observed in females. In the alcoholic AP model, both male and female MANF-KO mice showed increased ER stress (p-IRE1, p-eIF2, GRP78), apoptosis, inflammation, macrophage infiltration, regeneration, and lipase levels, whereas elevated HMGB1 expression and oxidative stress again predominantly occurred in male MANF-KO mice. Together, these findings reveal a critical and sex-specific role for MANF in regulating pancreatic stress responses and inflammatory injury, supporting its potential contribution as a genetic factor in AP pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that the delivery of full length ALPK3 via adeno-associated virus could restore contractile function in human cardiac organoids and in vivo mouse models carrying clinically relevant mutations in ALPK3. The role of disrupted proteostasis networks in multiple forms of genetic cardiomyopathy suggest that delivery this novel AAV-ALPK3 may provide functional benefit outside of cardiomyopathy induced by ALPK3. Titin truncating variants (TTNtv) are the most common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, and interestingly also contributes to the M-Band protein quality control network coordinated by ALPK3.

This hyperphagic response is blunted at thermoneutrality, leading to loss of lean mass and body weight. Protein-restricted mice also fail to exhibit protein preference at thermoneutrality, despite elevated circulating FGF21 levels. Circulating levels of essential amino acids (AAs) are tightly regulated during protein restriction at 22C, but this regulation is lost at 28C. Metabolomic and transcriptional analyses revealed a role for hepatic and brown fat AA-derived acylcarnitines and N-acetyl AAs in buffering free AA levels for the maintenance of AA homeostasis at 22C, but these pathways are blunted at thermoneutrality.

Cytological studies revealed adjacent nuclei distribution and incomplete cytokinesis at late meiosis II in meiocytes within the CCM flowers. Immunolocalization of -tubulin and the microtubule-associated protein MAP65-3 showed that the orientation of spindles at metaphase II and the organization of radial microtubule arrays at the tetrad stage are interfered, which explains the production of meiotically-restituted microspores. Moreover, the CCM flowers showed a gradually impaired expression of Aborted Microspores (AMS), a key transcription factor regulating tapetum development and meiotic cytokinesis. Interestingly, an increased supply of sucrose in culture medium promoted the expression of AMS and partially rescued haploid microspore formation in the CCM flowers.

We examined variation in key leaf traits - specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content, C:N and N:P ratios, and stable isotope composition (delta13C, delta15N) - in 160 tree species along a 3,200-meter elevational transect on Mount Cameroon. This gradient spans hyper-humid coastal rainforests to arid Afroalpine savannas, capturing sharp transitions in climate, soils, and forest structure. Leaf traits shifted nonlinearly with elevation, from acquisitive strategies at mid-elevations to conservative syndromes in both lowlands and highlands. Mid-elevation forests (approximately 1,000-1,500 m), characterized by moderate climate and canopy disturbance by elephants, supported nutrient-rich, high-SLA foliage. In contrast, high-elevation forests above 2,000 m exhibited low SLA, high C:N ratios, and enriched delta13C, consistent with stress tolerance under cold, dry, and fire-prone conditions. The strongest phosphorus limitation occurred in hyper-humid lowlands, where extreme rainfall (greater than 12,000 mm per year) drives leaching losses. Foliar delta15N declined markedly with elevation (from +5 per mil to -5 per mil), indicating a shift from mineral nitrogen uptake and nitrogen fixation in lowland Fabaceae to ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal associations in montane Ericaceae. A bimodal delta15N pattern - enrichment in both lowland and upper montane forests - reflects nitrogen fixation under leaching and fire-driven nitrogen scarcity. Phylogenetic analyses showed that climate, soils, forest structure, and lineage jointly shaped trait-environment relationships. Traits related to delta13C, C:N, and delta15N exhibited strong phylogenetic signal, highlighting evolutionary constraints.

The disease is caused by monopartite begomoviruses belonging to the Geminiviridae family, primarily tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), which often co-infect tomato plants, promoting the emergence of recombinant viral genomes. To investigate the diversity and evolutionary dynamics of these viruses, symptomatic plants collected from agricultural sites in Sicily between 2020 and 2022, along with archived plant samples from 1994 to 1999, were analyzed. For each collection site, leaves from symptomatic plants were pooled to form representative samples. Total nucleic acids were extracted and subjected to rolling circle amplification to enrich circular viral genomes. The amplified products were sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing to obtain full-length viral genomes. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that archived samples exclusively contained TYLCSV-related sequences, confirming its historical predominance in Sicilian agroecosystems. Recent samples, by contrast, no longer contained TYLCV or TYLCSV parental genomes but were dominated by TYLCV-derived recombinants such as TYLCV-IS141- and TYLCV-IS76-like variants, indicating a temporal shift in the structure of the viral population. Furthermore, a distinct group of newly emerged recombinants, provisionally referred to as TYLCV-IMS54, was identified in the most recent samples. Their genome comprises a TYLCV backbone, a 54-nucleotide segment from TYLCSV located downstream of the stem-loop region, and an 341-nucleotide region derived from TYLCV-Mild.

To complement experimental approaches, we developed a digital twin (DT) model to simulate the pattern formation of septal and biliary fibrosis, the two common forms of liver fibrosis. This model is based on iterative calibration with experiments from animal models treated with the hepatotoxic substance CCl4 (septal form) and Abcb4-knockout mice (biliary form). Septal fibrosis is characterized by ECM accumulation along the connective line between the central veins of neighboring liver lobules, while biliary fibrosis is marked by a scattered ECM pattern within the portal fields. This mechanistic DT model includes the components of hepatocytes (Heps), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), macrophages (Mphs), bile duct (BD) cells, collagen fibers secreted by activated HSCs, blood vessels, and cell-cell communication. It allows for the integration and simultaneous modulation of multiple hypothesized mechanisms underlying fibrotic wall formation. The model simulates the formation of liver fibrosis pattern and demonstrates that ECM distribution results from the pattern of cell death zones and biomechanical compression due to cell proliferation. \"Healthy\" Heps proliferate to compensate for cell loss. In septal fibrosis, where the cell death zones are several cells thick, the proliferating Heps surrounding a zone mechanically compress the deposited collagen network. After a transient phase of collagen scattered between/around Heps, the ECM eventually adopts a sharp, \"wall\"-like structure. Whereas, in biliary fibrosis, the pattern of cell death is more scattered, leading to a corresponding scattered ECM pattern. In this case, a pattern of scattered distributed collagen forms without transitioning to a sharp wall. Notably, the failure of fibrotic wall formation in endothelial cell-specific GATA4LSEC-KO mice, due to the disrupted pattern of CYP2E1-expressing Heps, validates our DT model. In conclusion, the DT model provided a deeper understanding of liver fibrosis pattern formation. It enabled comparison between simulated outcomes of hypothesized mechanisms and experimental data. Additionally, it guided the design of validation experiments and enabled the identification of optimal strategies for drug testing and extrapolation to humans.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Protective immunity against C. difficile infection is limited as patients are susceptible to multiple rounds of recurrent infections. The factors determining whether immunity to TcdA and TcdB is generated remain incompletely defined. We determined that C. difficile-infected mice generate antibody and IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cell responses to TcdA, but not TcdB. To determine the mechanism of the failed anti-TcdB immunity, C. difficile mutant strains expressing glucosyltransferase inactive (GTX) TcdA, and/or glucosyltransferase inactive TcdB were used. Infection with TcdBGTX or dual mutant (TcdAGTX TcdBGTX) restored TcdB-specific antibody responses, while infection with TcdAGTX or TcdAGTX TcdBGTX led to an earlier induction of TcdA-specific antibodies. Finally, infection with the dual GTX mutant enhanced TcdA and TcdB-specific CD4+ T cell responses. These data demonstrate that the glucosyltransferase activity of TcdA and TcdB hinders the antigen-specific adaptive immune response to itself and may be a mechanism that underlies high recurrence rates following C. difficile infection in patients.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

While canonical nucleosides remained chemically intact, thirteen biologically relevant modifications decomposed in a temperature-dependent manner. 4-thiouridine underwent desulfurisation and dimerisation, 3-methylcytidine deaminated to 3-methyluridine, and N4-acetylcytidine hydrolysed to cytidine followed by deamination to uridine. mcm5s2U displayed desulfurisation, whereas i6A showed low-level de-prenylation. High-resolution MS established accurate formulas for all degradation products. In order to provide a quantitative basis for nucleoside stability, reaction free energies (deltaG298) for four known decomposition reactions, namely deglycosylation, deamination, deacetylation and desulfurisation, were determined in solution phase quantum chemical calculations. The free energies of these reactions correlate well with the experimental data. All plates remain archived and will be re-analysed at 12, 24 and 36 months to establish long-term rate constants.

H.; Das, A.; Staley, J. P.", "abstract": "Before the spliceosome engages a pre-mRNA to excise its introns, the catalytic small nuclear RNA (snRNA) U6 is inactive because of base pairing with U4 snRNA; thus, spliceosome activation requires unwinding of base paired U4/U6, composed of stem I and stem II. The Ski2-like ATPase and RNA helicase Brr2p facilitates U4/U6 unwinding and the ultimately irreversible release of U4; however, the molecular mechanism behind Brr2p-mediated U4/U6 unwinding and the roles of the snRNAs in unwinding remains incompletely understood. To investigate the mechanism in vivo in budding yeast, we screened an unwinding deficient, cold-sensitive brr2 mutant, associated with retinitis pigmentosa in humans, for genetic interactions with mutations in U4 snRNA. Destabilizing U4 mutations in either stem I or stem II suppressed the brr2 mutant, providing functional evidence that Brr2p disrupts both stems in vivo. Further, destabilizing mutations in the intervening 5' stem loop of U4 also suppressed the brr2 mutant, and in vitro Brr2p displaced Prp31p from this stem loop, implicating Brr2p in disruption of this structure, too. Unexpectedly and counterintuitively, many destabilizing mutations in U4/U6 stem I exacerbated the brr2 mutant. These mutations disrupted an intramolecular stem loop (U4-ISL1) in U4 that is mutually exclusive with U4/U6 stem I. We found that U4-ISL1 is required for splicing in vivo and for U4/U6 unwinding in vitro. Altogether, these results implicate Brr2p in disrupting all U4 secondary structures upstream of its initial U4 binding site and implicate an important role for U4 in antagonizing U4/U6 reannealing during Brr2p-mediated U4/U6 unwinding.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

While temperature's role in WNV transmission is established, its effect on season length is less clear. This study asks: (1) Has the WNV season lengthened in NYS over the past 25 years? (2) Is a longer season linked to higher WNV incidence in mosquitoes and humans? and (3) Are these changes associated with shifts in the timing of infection onset and termination in hosts? We integrated daily county-level temperature, mosquito surveillance, and human case data from 1999--2024. Our results show the WNV season has extended by an average of 24.8 days--starting 4 days earlier and ending 20 days later. Longer seasons are positively associated with greater WNV prevalence in both mosquitoes and people.

Here we demonstrate that Keyhole and Landsat sensors are capable of detecting presence and long-term change in penguin guano on sea-ice despite challenging environmental conditions. For 18 of the 66 known emperor penguin colonies, we confirmed their presence in images that predate earliest published records. We further used dense time series from 1960s to 2024 of the Cape Washington colony to exemplify change in guano area over time - but found little variation in guano area. We show that the guano area undergoes two distinct stages during a breeding season (a stable and clustered early stage, and a diffused and widespread late stage). We correlated guano area with penguin colony size and found that guano area correlates with colony size (Spearmans p = 0.59, p-value = 0.017). Taken together, our results suggest long term resilience of penguin colonies in face of global change, and highlight that the use of historical remote sensing imagery across the Antarctic can inform conservation efforts and benefit the ongoing historical studies of penguin colony dynamics.

Combined with miR-23b-mediated repression, these events exacerbate splicing defects and downstream cellular dysfunction. Our approach aimed to restore functional MBNL1 protein levels by antagonizing miR-23b effects. Using a multi-step screening process, we evaluated antimiRs with varied sequences, lengths, chemical modifications, and lipid conjugations. A critical optimization was the inclusion of a 3'-end oleic acid conjugation, together with a specific chemical pattern of modifications, which significantly enhanced the muscle uptake and efficacy of lead candidates, demonstrated robust biological activity in preclinical models, including HSALR and DMSXL mice, and human primary myoblasts. Lead candidates significantly increased MBNL1 protein levels, corrected mis-splicing events, improved functional outcomes such as muscle strength and reduced myotonia, and exhibited efficient in vivo biodistribution to skeletal muscle, addressing a key target tissue of DM1 pathology. Toxicological assessments in vitro revealed a favorable safety profile with minimal immune activation or renal toxicity at preclinical doses.

EC dysfunction is a hallmark of complex inflammatory diseases, including cancer and atherosclerosis. Therefore, this study modeled acute inflammation in vitro using 53 genetically distinct human aortic EC lines exposed to interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) or control media. This approach identified 1,224 differentially spliced transcripts (DSTs) between IL-1{beta} and control conditions. DSTs were enriched for alternative first (AF) exons, including several novel mRNA isoforms of disease-associated and metabolic genes. It was hypothesized and confirmed that AF splicing was driven by alternative promoters using ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data. To identify alternative promoters driving IL-1{beta}-dependent AF isoforms, a quantitative measure of promoter activity ratios was defined, and analysis found that histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation and binding of the transcription factors ERG and RELA often correlated with alternative promoter usage. Finally, the effect of common genetic variants on alternative first exon usage was interrogated through splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) analysis. Significant sQTLs were next submitted to genetic colocalization analysis with cardiovascular-related associations identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), finding colocalized signals at 66 human disease loci corresponding to 30 genes and 39 variants. These genetically regulated splicing differences provide plausible mechanisms explaining some of the genetic risk for cardiovascular-related diseases. Among the top signals are novel isoforms of Endothelial Protein C Receptor (PROCR) and Distal Membrane Arm Assembly Component 2 (DMAC2), whose splicing patterns colocalize with risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). This study demonstrates the prevalence of inducible alternative promoters and supports that ECs express numerous novel transcripts regulated by genetics and inflammation that are consistent with driving individual risk for cardiovascular disease.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

We compared a health-screened 'Reference' cohort (n=94) with an unscreened 'Average' urban cohort (n=527), for which we analyzed taxonomic structure, microbial diversity, and predicted metabolic potential. The 'Average' cohort displayed significantly lower alpha-diversity, primarily driven by reduced community evenness rather than richness. Functionally, this cohort showed a significantly diminished predicted capacity for synthesizing beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and essential vitamins B9 and B12. A longitudinal analysis of a subgroup (n=9) undertaking lifestyle modifications demonstrated that while microbial richness and SCFA production could be significantly improved, responses were highly individualized.

Despite its significant impact on agriculture, genomic and molecular studies of clubroot disease are hindered due to the complex life cycle and the obligate biotrophic nature of the pathogen, which prevents its cultivation in vitro. In addition, several genotypes of P. brassicae are often present as a mixture in a single field sample, making it challenging to resolve high-quality assemblies of individual genomes. Recently, several genomes were assembled for some strains of P. brassicae, however, in-depth genomic analysis of this devastating pathogen remains limited. In this study, we generated complete telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies for three Australian P. brassicae field isolates using PacBio Revio HiFi sequencing combined with chromatin conformation capture technology (Hi-C). Importantly, we could generate two nearly fully phased haplotype genome assemblies from one of the field isolates. Additionally, we sequenced 14 isolates of P. brassicae, sampled from a wide geographical range across Australia using Illumina technology and performed an in-depth global comparative phylogenetic analysis. We revealed that Australian isolates are classified into three different clades, including a highly divergent and unique clade present only in Australia. Comparative analysis showed that the predicted effector profile of the Australian-unique clade is distinct from other clades, further supporting phylogenetic divergence.

We overcome this difficulty by applying an affinity-ligand composed of a small molecule that specifically recognizes a particular domain in a given co-activator multiprotein complex. This molecule is coupled to a desthiobiotin moiety, which allows binding to streptavidin beads and can be eluted using biotin. To demonstrate the universal utility of this idea to practically any co-activator complex from any cell source we synthesized a compound conjugating desthiobiotin to GSK4027, a molecule that targets the bromodomain in the GCN5/PCAF catalytic subunit of SAGA and ATAC acetyltransferase complexes. Employing this heterobifunctional affinity ligand and a novel purification scheme adapted to low-abundance complexes, we isolated the 1.6 MDa SAGA complex from two cancer cell lines to high degree of purity and activity. We then solved the structure of the isolated 20-subunit SAGA complex to high-resolution (2.3-3 [A]) by cryo-EM, elucidating for the first time the molecular details of how its enigmatic splicing module anchors into SAGA.

This study identifies and characterizes several novel cobalamin-binding proteins and elucidates their roles in cobamide uptake and delivery via bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs), highlighting their siderophore-like function for competitive nutrient acquisition. We demonstrate that BtuJ1 and BtuJ2, members of the IPR027828 protein family, bind cobalamin with distinct structural and kinetic properties and are key components of BEVs responsible for cobamide capture and transfer to cells. Structural analyses reveal a conserved augmented {beta}-jellyroll architecture in these proteins, with tyrosine residues playing a central role in stabilizing cobalamin binding. Comparative proteomics of BEVs and cells under cobamide starvation underscore the selective enrichment of BtuJ proteins in BEVs, suggesting a specialized mechanism for nutrient acquisition. Additionally, we identify another novel B12-binding protein, BtuK1. We further establish BtuL as a critical player in early BEV release and propose a theoretical model in which BEVs function similarly to siderophores, scavenging cobalamin in the environment and delivering it to cells via specific receptors.

Here, we present a deep learning framework based on the YOLOv12n-seg architecture for the automated identification, instance segmentation, and quantification of zooplankton from high-resolution images.

This expands the scope of automated zooplankton monitoring from presence/absence data to demographic assessments, including shifts in size distributions and the possibility to be used for unraveling morphological adaptations.

In this study, we investigate the interaction of reconstituted Pdr5 in an artificial freestanding horizontal lipid bilayer system with Rhodamine 6G (R6G), a well-known Pdr5 substrate. We show that functionally reconstituted Pdr5 actively transports the R6G cation across the membrane in an ATP-dependent manner, moving it from one bulk phase to the other.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

However, their structural plasticity, ranging from disordered to context-dependent folding, makes them challenging targets for molecular simulations. In this work, we benchmark the performance of twelve popular and emerging fixed-charge force fields across a curated set of twelve peptides spanning structured miniproteins, context sensitive epitopes, and disordered sequences. Each peptide was simulated from both folded (200 ns) and extended (10 microseconds) states to assess stability, folding behavior, and force field biases. Our analysis reveals consistent trends: some force fields exhibit strong structural bias, others allow reversible fluctuations, and no single model performs optimally across all systems. The study highlights limitations in current force fields' ability to balance disorder and secondary structure, particularly when modeling conformational selection. These results offer practical guidance for peptide modeling and establish a benchmark framework for future force field development and validation in peptide relevant regimes.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

To counteract this, we have utilized oncolytic adenovirus (OV) Ad5-{Delta}24-RGD as a platform to overexpress a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) targeting both T cell marker CD3 and GBM specific tumor associated antigen IL-13R2. We first demonstrated that OV-BiTE could enhance recruitment of T cells to GBM in vitro and in vivo. We then showed that intratumoral injection of OV-BiTE followed by infusion of combined EGFR- and EGFRvIII-CAR-T cells was more effective than OV-BiTE supplemented with either CAR-T therapy alone, and led to significant tumor eradication in a GBM xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, our multimodal OV-BiTE & CAR-T cell immunotherapy is capable of overcoming immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and GBM resistance to treatment.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Ovarian cancer (OC), particularly the high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) subtype, is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and limited treatment options. Among the miRNAs encoded at the often amplified 8q24.3 region, miR-6850 has emerged as a potential candidate target owing to its genomic positioning inside this hotspot and its unexpectedly low expression in HGSOC tissues and cell lines. In silico investigations indicated that, despite the gain in MIR6850 copy number, its mature products, miR-6850-5p and miR-6850-3p, were expressed at low levels; notably, MIR6850 gene amplification was associated with enhanced disease-specific survival. Functional studies revealed that ectopic production of both isoforms in SKOV-3 and NIH:OVCAR3 cells inhibited proliferation, compromised clonogenic capacity, and disturbed cell cycle progression. Moreover, miR-6850 altered cell phenotype by facilitating mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), as shown by the overexpression of E-cadherin and {beta}-catenin and the downregulation of Slug and Vimentin. It also regulated cell adhesion and migration while reducing global protein synthesis via the downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

F.; Kahmen, A.; Studer, A. S.", "abstract": "The stable nitrogen (N) isotope composition of organic matter encapsulated in diatom silica frustules ({delta}15NDB) from sedimentary records has been used as a proxy for reconstructing N consumption dynamics in the ocean over geologic time scales. This proxy relies on the assumption that {delta}15NDB tracks biomass {delta}15N, without being affected by internal N-isotope fractionation. However, recent ground-truthing efforts have shown that {delta}15NDB can diverge from biomass {delta}15N values, though the extent and mechanisms behind this decoupling remain unclear. In this study, we cultured two freshwater and two marine diatom species in batch cultures to test whether {delta}15NDB (1) is subject to species-dependent internal 15N fractionation, and (2) reflects the {delta}15N of source nitrate to the same extent as biomass {delta}15N values, assessing asynchronous integration of the N isotope signal. We monitored the N isotope systematics during diatom growth by measuring {delta}15N values in nitrate, bulk biomass and frustule-bound organic N throughout batch culture progression. We found that {delta}15NDB did not follow typical Rayleigh fractionation dynamics and remained relatively stable, while biomass {delta}15N increased predictably with progressive fractional nitrate consumption. The observed divergence could not be explained by de-synchronized integration of source-nitrate {delta}15N values into biomass versus frustule-bound organic N (i.e. delayed incorporation into frustule-bound material), as newly formed frustules clearly recorded the {delta}15N of the 15N-labeled nitrate added during growth. This confirmed that {delta}15NDB values capture the isotopic signature of newly assimilated nitrate rather than N derived from internal or legacy pools. We hypothesize that shifts in growth conditions during batch culture progression altered the interaction between carbon and nitrogen metabolism, leading to physiologically driven variation in internal 15N fractionation and corresponding offsets between {delta}15NDB and biomass {delta}15N. Such sensitivity to internal isotope fractionation during biosynthesis has important implications for the interpretation of sedimentary {delta}15NDB records.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

However, results of nutrition studies investigating the impact of n-3 PUFA intake on immune functions, such as phagocytosis, are contradictory. In order to gain more insights into the role of n-3 PUFAs on phagocytosis, we investigated the modulation of phagocytosis by n-3 PUFAs and derived oxylipins in human macrophages. Methods and results: Using an established ex vivo supplementation strategy, primary human macrophages were supplemented with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The PUFA pattern of the cells was shifted from a low n-3 PUFA status towards a high n-3 PUFA status. This was accompanied by a shift in the oxylipin pattern, reduced pro-inflammatory prostaglandin levels, increased phagocytosis in the supplemented macrophages, and reduced inhibitory effect of PGE2 on phagocytosis. However, when tested alone, n-3 PUFA derived oxylipins did not impact phagocytosis. Conclusion: Under controlled conditions, an increased n-3 PUFA status of macrophages resulted in an elevation of phagocytosis. Less formation of prostaglandins could contribute to this effect, whereas n-3 PUFA derived oxylipins, particularly (multi)hydroxy PUFAs, appear to have a limited impact on phagocytosis following n-3 PUFA supplementation.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Many of the most characterized responses are initiated by a single protein produced by the male accessory gland called the Sex Peptide (SP). Yet many Drosophila species, even those living in similar environments, do not have SP. As PMRs are thought to be mechanisms used to maximize reproductive success, we wondered if PMRs are similar in species living in the same environment and how PMRs might be achieved in species that lack SP. Here, we investigate the post-mating responses of D. hydei. D. hydei is a Drosophilid that lacks SP, but is often found cohabitating with D. melanogaster. We show that the PMR in D. hydei is markedly different from that found in D. melanogaster; D. hydei do not increase egg production, nor do they limit remating to additional males or change their diet after mating. Instead, hydei seem to display only subtle PMRs related to activity patterns, in a way distinct from those characterized in D. melanogaster. These changes seem to have impacted things like lifespan and sperm selection, and demonstrate the wide variety of choices that species can make and be successful in a given environment.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Single-molecule and structural analyses reveal that NAC, via its {beta}-barrel domain, dynamically interacts with nascent chains at the ribosomal tunnel exit and is capable of promoting on-pathway folding. Compartment-specific nascent chain interactions of NAC further elucidate its role in targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membrane protein biogenesis.

While the physiological relevance of this complex has been increasingly recognized, whether SEL1L is strictly required for HRD1 function in mammals has remained unclear. Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro approaches, we define the architecture and physiological significance of the mammalian SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD complex. Our data demonstrate that direct binding between SEL1L and HRD1 is essential for ERAD function and neonatal survival in mice. In three knock-in mouse models harboring targeted mutations at the SEL1L-HRD1 interface, we show that the L709P variant - unlike the benign P699T mutation - results in complete neonatal lethality within 30 hours of birth, a phenotype more severe than that of the partially lethal S658P variant. Mechanistically, the L709P mutation abolishes SEL1L-HRD1 interaction, disrupting substrate engagement and impairing recruitment of the E2 enzyme UBE2J1, leading to the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Notably, these defects can be partially rescued by HRD1 overexpression, echoing findings from yeast. Together, our results provide definitive evidence that the SEL1L-HRD1 interaction is essential for ERAD activity and neonatal viability in mammals, resolving a long-standing question in ERAD biology and identifying a new therapeutic strategy for modulating ERAD activity in humans.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Unlike other animals, insects cannot biosynthesise sterols de novo so must acquire them from diet. Honeybees selectively uptake a subset of pollen sterols for use in their own tissues, rather than converting b-sitosterol or stigmasterol to cholesterol, as occurs in most insect herbivores because they do not have the chemical architecture to modify sterols like other insects. We do not know if this strategy is also employed by other bee species. 2. Here, we measured the sterol profiles of 56 species representing all families of UK bees to identify whether the same pollen sterols are used by solitary and eusocial bee species. 3. The {triangleup}5 sterols 24-methylenecholesterol, isofucosterol and {beta}-sitosterol which are common components of pollen sterolomes were also the main sterols found in all bee species. Campesterol and cholesterol were recorded almost universally in bees but in proportionately small amounts, despite their low abundance in pollen. 4. Our data suggest an ecological rather than phylogenetic driver of bee sterols because related species differed as a function of pollen diet. Generalist species contained more 24-methlyenecholesterol than their specialist congeners suggesting a trade-off between competition for food and desirable sterols. Asteraceae specialists have adapted to use pollen sterols that are not used by generalists, potentially gaining an advantage over these species. Despite the uptake of less common sterols by specialists, they still relied on similar sterols to other bee species. The dietary requirements of specialists could be fulfilled by pollen from non-host species, suggesting that while essential, sterols are not the primary driving force of pollen foraging choices.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

A.; Carter, A. P.; Bullock, S.

This spatial control is mediated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with localization signals within target mRNAs. However, these signals lack overt sequence or structural patterns, even when targeted by the same protein, raising the question of how specificity is achieved. Here, we investigate this question using the Drosophila RBP Egalitarian (Egl), which couples developmentally important mRNAs to microtubule-based transport via Bicaudal D (BicD) and the dynein motor protein. We present cryo-EM structures of Egl-BicD in complex with six different RNAs. Egl uses multiple non-canonical double-stranded RNA-binding domains to cooperatively form a recognition pocket around a localization signal. Despite substantial variation in length and sequence, each signal adopts a bent stem-loop conformation that, together with base-pair identities at two defined sites, drives Egl binding. We further demonstrate that Egl dimers couple RNA binding to transport initiation through coincident detection of two RNA elements within the same transcript. Collectively, we show that diverse localizing mRNAs are recognized through a combination of shape, positional sequence features, and number of structured RNA elements. This work provides a framework for understanding how other RBPs engage highly variable mRNAs.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we define the relevance of AXL in melanoma with focus on efficacy of AXL-targeted therapy to restore sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy, shift TAM profiles, and augment anti-tumor immune responses in a TiME-specific context. We first demonstrated that the AXL+ tumor cell populations within melanoma are small, with TAMs representing the overwhelming source of AXL expression and activity. AXL inhibition effectively treated ICB-resistant melanoma and synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy in vivo; however, results were TAM-dependent. In vitro and in vivo, AXL inhibition in macrophages resulted in a powerful immunostimulatory reprogramming with net effect of disrupting checkpoint interactions in tumors. These results indicate that use of AXL as a selective biomarker or AXL inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to restore ICB responses may be cell-type or TiME-specific.

Whilst much effort aims to prevent NNGI incursions and these subsequent processes, their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We collected data on snout-vent length (SVL), tail length (TL) and clutch size during an eradication program of hybrid and non-native iguanas on the island of Saba. First, we genetically assessed the status (native/hybrid/non-native) of individuals from Saba. Subsequently, we combined these data with total length (SVL+TL) data from NNGI on St. Martin (source of NNGI on Saba), and SVL and clutch size from native insular and mainland Iguana populations. We found that hybrids on Saba produce significantly larger clutches than similar sized native Saba iguanas, and even larger than one mainland population. However, native Saba iguanas are only significantly smaller than NNGI from St. Martin, not hybrids from Saba, based on total length comparisons. Our results suggest that declines in native Iguana populations are at least partially driven by genetic swamping, through larger clutch sizes of NNGI as well as larger clutch sizes of hybrid iguanas compared to native iguanas.

The influence of circulation, temperature, and food supply on larval recruitment is quantified using modeled variables, which include larval dispersal distance, larval source location, larval food supply, and temperature exposure for larvae and adults and are derived for 18 years and five larval recruitment sites. Sensitivity testing of the variables to different plankton larval durations (PLDs), larval behaviors, and nearshore retention is performed. All variables are found to be relatively insensitive to changes in PLD greater than 26 days. Larval dispersal distance and source location, representing changes in circulation, are found to be more sensitive to larval behavior and nearshore retention than larval food supply and temperature exposure for larvae or adults. All variables are statistically compared to recruitment field data. Temperature exposure for adults during the fall reproductive season is found to be a strong driver of larval recruitment, but temperature exposure for larvae during the spring recruitment season is not. Thus, we hypothesize that the timing of species recruitment and reproduction is a critical factor in predicting the impact of temperature on larval recruitment. Circulation is found to be a driver of larval recruitment if larvae have behavior that reduces their dispersal distance, allowing them to come from source sites near to the recruitment sites. Food supply is not found to be a driver of larval recruitment.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Competitive intransitivity or non-hierarchical interactions, such as those exemplified by the rock-paper-scissors game, where no single competitor wins outright, has been proposed as a key mechanism for maintaining biodiversity; however, empirical evidence supporting the importance of intransitivity remains limited. Natural populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae often include strains harboring totivirus-satellite coinfections that encode a lethal toxic glycoprotein capable of eliminating competing yeast strains. Killer strains are sparsely distributed in natural populations, despite their competitive advantage. Yeast isolates occasionally exhibit toxin resistance, but it remains untested whether they can outcompete and replace killer strains. Similarly, the persistence of toxin-susceptible yeast is not well understood - particularly whether they can invade resistant populations in the absence of killers, thereby completing an intransitive loop. In a multi-year collection of yeast isolates from vineyards across New Zealand, we observed a near-complete disappearance of a previously common killer yeast genotype of S. cerevisiae over consecutive years. Using space-time-shift competition assays, we demonstrate that strains sympatric to this killer genotype were ubiquitously resistant, unlike the allopatric strains that were frequently eliminated in competition assays. Furthermore, the extinction of the focal killer genotype appears to have enabled the emergence of toxin-susceptible competitors in sites formerly occupied by the killer genotype. Our findings suggest that the competitive advantage of toxin production is evident in natural populations but appears to be eroded when resistance evolves in competitors of the focal killer genotype. We suggest that such killer-resistant-susceptible polymorphisms are being maintained by evolutionary dynamics akin to rock-paper-scissors-like intransitivity, driven by the invasion of susceptible strains after costly resistance has driven killer strains to extinction in natural populations, all being driven by toxin-encoding coinfections.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

However, functional characterisation of Avr effectors in Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) remains challenging due to its obligate biotrophic lifestyle. Here, we used a high-throughput wheat protoplast-based screen to evaluate Avr/R interactions efficiently, enabling rapid detection of effector-induced defence responses across diverse wheat cultivars. We identified an Avr candidate that we termed AvrPstB48 as a defence-activating effector, consistently triggering defence responses in 16 out of 24 independent wheat cultivars tested. AvrPstB48 is hemizygous, and the Pst genome carries four divergent paralogs within a single gene cluster on separate haplotypes. Analysis of these paralogs revealed partial redundancy in their abilities to activate wheat defences and enabled us to identify a single amino acid in AvrPstB48, which is necessary but not sufficient for defence activation. Notably, the activation of defence by AvrPstB48 in protoplasts did not consistently translate into resistance in planta. Whole-plant infection assays revealed that some cultivars that exhibited strong defence activation in the protoplast assay remained fully susceptible to Pst. However, comparison of infection dynamics between the AvrPstB48-recognising cultivar Avocet S and the non-recognising susceptible cultivar Morocco revealed a delay in disease progression in Avocet S, evidenced by reduced mycelial growth and increased callose deposition at 10 days post-inoculation. This supports the hypothesis that while AvrPstB48 is recognised by specific host genotypes, its immune activation is actively suppressed in planta by additional Pst-encoded suppressor effectors.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Major orchestrators of plant responses to N include members of the HRS1 HOMOLOG (HHO) family of transcription factors (TFs).

Here, we highlight a unique role for a phylogenetically diverged HHO TF, HHO5, whose expression is regulated in an N-dose dependent fashion and is specifically expressed in phloem. We found that an HHO5 single mutant displays significant misregulation of N-dose dependent genes and plant growth rates. HHO5 is also unique as it displays a dual activator/repressor activity on N-dose dependent gene regulation. HHO5 specifically acts as a direct gene repressor when binding DNA targets. In contrast, genes activated by HHO5 include indirect targets regulated by TFs downstream of HHO5 (TF2s). To validate the influence of HHO5 via its direct TF2s, we used validated TF2 data to build a gene regulatory network that links HHO5-TF2 targets to ~70% of the N-dose genes regulated by HHO5 in planta. By these means, we define HHO5 as a novel dual activator/repressor of plant N-dose signaling.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

However, it is not effective in all cancer patients, rendering the need to further delineate the differences among responders and non-responders at the molecular and cellular level. Unresponsiveness to immunotherapy has been attributed to dysfunctional immune cell states such as T-cell exhaustion and anergy, whereas the contribution of cellular senescence remains elusive. Herein, we have investigated the role of immune cell senescence in the response to checkpoint inhibitors in melanomas where these immunotherapies are applied as a first line treatment. Methods: Two senescence detecting complementary approaches were utilized in a case control study we conducted. First, we implemented a senescence molecular signature we developed, termed SeneVick retrospectively in a single cell RNA-seq dataset from melanoma patients who received immunotherapy. Prior to this analysis, the signature was extensively validated in a variety of cell/tissue contexts, senescence types and species. Second, cellular senescence was assessed via an established experimental algorithmic approach in circulating immune cells of an analogous melanoma clinical cohort. Results: Melanoma patients who did not respond to immunotherapy exhibited increased cellular senescence in their CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, B-cells and NK cells compared to responders. This phenomenon was independent of patients' age and not an outcome of immunotherapy, in contrast to conventional anti-cancer treatments. Interestingly, alterations of cell-cell interactions among the immune sub-populations in non-responders compared to responders were identified, suggesting the involvement of immune cell senescence in defective immune responses and treatment failure. Conclusion: Overall, our findings support cellular senescence of the immune cell compartment within the TME, as a potent determinant of the response to immunotherapy and pave the way for strategies targeting immune cell senescence, as promising approaches to improve the outcome of such interventions.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

We performed integrated multi-omics analysis including transcriptomic, genomic (copy number, single-nucleotide variants) on 1,149 tumors from 1,102 HNSCC patients across treatment settings. Using the Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) algorithm, we defined immune subtype clusters (ISCs) based on the full immune gene landscape. These clusters were characterized using mutational, transcriptional, and immune cell enrichment analyses, and mapped to hypoxia and traditional subtypes. Associations with clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival, were evaluated across first-line and post-metastatic treatment settings. Four distinct immune subtype clusters (ISC1 - ISC4) were identified: ISC1: immune-cold and EMT-enriched; ISC2: immune activated; ISC3: mixed immune-regulatory and stromal-enriched phenotype; and ISC4: immunosuppressed. Distinct treatment response patterns were observed across subtypes in subjects treated with checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and combination regimens. 44 Patients with matched pre/post treatment tumors revealed treatment-associated transitions between immune subtypes: checkpoint inhibitor treatment enriched for immune activation, while chemotherapy treatment enriched for immunosuppressive signaling pathways.

Influenza viruses adapted to transmission in birds and some other animals tend to have a less stable hemagglutinin (HA) than seasonal influenza viruses, enabling membrane fusion at comparatively high pH levels. Here, we combine five mutations within H5 HA that dramatically increase its melting temperature and promote stable closure of the HA trimer. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the stabilizing mutations create several new hydrophobic interactions, while maintaining local HA structure. We found that vaccinating mice with stabilized H5 HA immunogens resulted in higher hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization titers than non-stabilized comparators. Epitope mapping of vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibody responses using negative stain electron microscopy and deep mutational scanning showed that site E on the side of the HA receptor binding domain was immunodominant across all groups; however, the stabilized immunogens shifted responses toward the receptor binding site (RBS), eliciting a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies.

Although a densovirus was implicated in the mass mortality of one species of subtidal sea star during the geographically widespread epizootics that began in 2013, the etiology appears to vary among species, locations, and time periods, and in some cases may not even be associated with a pathogen.

Further, we used post-mortem immunohistochemistry to establish the ability to identify and measure the intranodal distance at nodes of Ranvier using in vivo THG imaging, and we found increased intranodal distances after cuprizone administration. We also developed a novel quantitative metric based on spatial concentration of the brightest THG signal that occurs before more overt changes like myelin blistering.

Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a key transducer of both Ca2+ and ROS signals during exercise. Here we show that CaMKII is chronically activated in aged muscles, promoting muscle dysfunction. Muscle-specific expression of a constitutively active CaMKII construct in young mice recapitulates features of aging muscles, including impaired contractility, progressive atrophy, mitochondrial disorganization, formation of tubular aggregates, and an older transcriptional profile characterized by the activation of inflammatory and stress response pathways. Mediation analysis identified altered heme metabolism as a potential mechanism of CaMKII-induced weakness, independent of muscle atrophy. Conversely, partial inhibition of CaMKII in aged muscle improved contractile function and shifted the transcriptome toward a more youthful state without inducing hypertrophy. These findings identify chronic CaMKII activation as a driver of functional and molecular muscle aging and support the concept that CaMKII exemplifies antagonistic pleiotropy, whereby its beneficial roles in promoting muscle performance and adaptation during youth may incur deleterious consequences in aging. We propose that persistent CaMKII activation in aged skeletal muscle reflects unresolved cellular stress and promotes maladaptive remodeling. Enhancing physiological reserve capacity through exercise, in combination with temporally targeted CaMKII inhibition, may help restore adaptive CaMKII signaling dynamics and preserve muscle function in aging.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Checkpoints arrest biological processes and enhance chances for error correction. In many species ranging from budding yeast to human, checkpoints are eventually overridden despite persistent damage. Whether checkpoint override serves a biological function remains unclear. Here, we investigate this question in the context of the DNA damage checkpoint (DDC) in budding yeast. To demonstrate that DDC override increases fitness, we pursued a novel approach: To avoid inherent ambiguities when comparing genetic mutants, we instead employed a light-controlled trigger to finely tune the timing of checkpoint override in a consistent wild-type DDC and DNA repair background. We show that override is beneficial and wild-type override timing maximizes fitness. We formulate two specific hypotheses to explain the fitness benefit: i) override enables multiple rounds of replication, including of broken chromosomal fragments, statistically increasing the chance of at least one successful repair; or ii) override may enhance specific DNA repair pathways. Testing the first hypothesis, we tracked broken chromosome fragments using an optogenetic reporter and found their segregation pattern to be inconsistent with a probabilistic increase in post-override repair opportunities. To test the second hypothesis, we dynamically depleted key repair pathway proteins - individually and combinatorially - without interfering with the establishment of checkpoint arrest. Strikingly, we found that proteins involved in microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) substantially enhanced override-associated break repair. Together, these results provide direct evidence of a fitness advantage conferred by checkpoint override and uncover MMEJ-associated repair proteins as the mechanistic basis.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Due to its , {beta}-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, OPDA covalently binds to free thiol groups by Michael addition. This binding, termed OPDAylation, alters the activity of target proteins, such as cyclophilin 20-3 (EC:5.2.1.8) and thioredoxins, that are essential components of the cellular redox regulatory network. To function as reversible redox regulatory mechanism, OPDAylation should be complemented by a process of de-OPDAylation allowing for fine-tuning of OPDA-dependent regulation. This study explored OPDAylation and de-OPDAylation in vitro with emphasis on involvement of glutathione. OPDA can be transferred from protein to glutathione (GSH), and vice versa. In a competition experiment, OPDAylation of thioredoxins occurred rapidly in the presence of GSH, while over extended incubation times, de-OPDAylation of TRX occurred due to the stoichiometric excess of GSH. These results support the hypothesis that the initial thioredoxin-based OPDAylation is proceeding under kinetic control due to the higher reactivity of the more nucleophilic cysteine moiety in thioredoxin compared to the one of GSH, while the OPDAylation of GSH observed at prolonged incubation time is then a result of a thermodynamically controlled process. De-OPDAylation depends on the protein's sensitivity towards OPDA, the pH and the concentration of excess thiol groups. This likely allows for precise modulation of OPDA amounts, as the rapid modification of protein activity enables subsequent induction of OPDA signaling, whereas de-OPDAylation, triggered by increasing glutathione, increasing cellular reduction or presumably enzymatically, reverses this effect.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Previous intramuscular vaccination strategies have failed to protect against HSV-2 infections due to their inability to induce robust local immunity and activate resident memory T cells (Trm cells). The approach known as \"prime and pull\", whereby host animals are primed with vaccines intramuscularly followed by vaginal delivery of specific chemokines to facilitate the recruitment of effector T cells (i.e., \"pull\"), confers partial protection against genital HSV-2 disease. However, this strategy fails to prevent infection or establish B cell-mediated immunity. Here, we introduce Bioactive Enhanced Adjuvant Chemokine Oligonucleotide Nanoparticles (BEACONs) formed via electrostatic interactions between CpG DNA and the chemokine CXCL9. This dual-function adjuvant promotes CD8+ T cell recruitment and enhances innate immune activation while reducing non-specific local inflammation. When co-administered vaginally with HSV-2 glycoproteins following intramuscular priming, BEACONs significantly improved protection against HSV by increasing local CD8+ Trm populations and augmenting mucosal IgG and IgA responses. Optimal immune protection required delivery of both local antigen and adjuvant delivery, as neither intramuscular boosting nor introduction of the vaginal adjuvant alone conferred comparable efficacy. Moreover, CD8+ T cell or B cell depletion led to a significant reduction in immune protection conferred by the BEACON-based \"pull\" strategy. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of engineered mucosal adjuvants as a means to coordinate local T and B cell responses and offer a promising approach for vaccines targeting genital herpes and other sexually transmitted infections.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

While polyploidy is an important catalyst of rapid radiations, it remains poorly studied in tropical tree radiations. We examined ploidy variation across Inga (Fabaceae), a characteristic Amazonian tree radiation, using DNA sequence data from 1305 loci for 189/282 Inga species. We then tested whether polyploid species experience more positive selection than diploids, particularly in loci underlying chemical defence against herbivory, which is a key ecological pressure affecting rainforest tree diversification. We show that tetraploidy occurs in 14% (N=27) of the Inga species we sequenced, with several widespread species showing geographical ploidy variation, alongside minimal phylogenetic signal in ploidy which suggests recurrent polyploidisation. Interestingly, we found more loci under selection in polyploids than diploids, most notably in chemical defence loci.

The pathological hallmarks of AD, beta-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), follow distinct stereotypical patterns of progression across brain regions and trigger a multicellular response that ultimately leads to neuronal loss and cognitive decline. Despite the uniform spread of A{beta} plaque across the cortex during AD progression, different regions demonstrate varying levels of vulnerability and resilience to temporal A{beta} plaque induced changes, such as NFT accumulation. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the cell types and molecular mechanisms that underlie these region-specific differences in resilience to A{beta} plaque induced changes. In this study, we hypothesized that brain region and cell type specific transcriptional responses within the A{beta} microenvironment, and more broadly within the grey matter, may contribute to this variation.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by both hemodynamic derangement and pulmonary arterial endothelial cell (PAEC) dysfunction. Despite importance in disease initiation and progression, the combined effects of shear and pressure forces on PAEC biology remain incompletely understood, particularly in the context of PAH. Methods: PAECs obtained at explant from controls and patients with idiopathic PAH or congenital heart disease-associated PAH (CHD-PAH) were cultured in a custom resistor-coupled microfluidic platform and exposed to static, low (3 dyne/cm2), or high (20 dyne/cm2) shear stress under either low or elevated (60 mmHg) pressure. After 24 hours, we assessed cellular morphology and performed transcriptomic analysis via bulk RNA sequencing, incorporating analyses of PAH subtype and donor sex. Results: Morphologically, PAECs (n=18 donors) aligned with flow under high, but not low, shear, and alignment was not significantly altered by disease state or pressure. As expected, shear stress fundamentally reorganized the PAEC transcriptome. The \"dose-response\" to increasing shear differed across biological pathways in six statistically significant patterns. Increasing shear led to divergence in transcription between control and PAH cells, particularly in pathways involved in immune activation, stress signaling, and vascular remodeling, with subtype differences also observed. Pressure had modest effects on transcription, with CHD-PAH PAECs notably displaying pressure-induced stress and inflammatory signaling. We identified sexual dimorphism in the endothelial shear response, including that male cells under shear enriched for proliferative and angiogenic pathways and female cells for fatty acid metabolism and stress responses. Conclusions: We provide a systems-level overview of how shear and pressure shape PAEC transcription, revealing divergent responses across disease state, PAH subtype, and donor sex.

Given the limited studies on the application of RBCEVs in the central nervous system (CNS) which is characterized by the presence of sensitive cell types with inherently low transfection efficiency, we hypothesized that RBCEVs could serve as a safe and effective sncRNA delivery vector for CNS applications, and that their incorporation into 3D-printed scaffolds could enable sustained and localized delivery of therapeutic sncRNAs. To test this, the uptake and gene silencing performance of RBCEVs were examined in primary CNS cell types, including astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and microglia. While over 70% of OPCs and microglia internalized RBCEVs, uptake in neurons and astrocytes remained below 40%, indicating cell-type-specific uptake efficiency. Additionally, RBCEVs-mediated delivery of siRNA resulted in the highest gene knockdown efficiency in OPCs (74.2%), while triggering less than 30% gene knockdown in other cell types. Next, RBCEVs-encapsulated scaffolds were fabricated using digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing, enabling the sustained release of miR-219/miR-338-loaded RBCEVs for at least 21 days in vitro, which resulted in effective gene silencing that promoted OPC differentiation and myelination. Using spinal cord injury (SCI) as a proof-of-concept, scaffold-mediated delivery of RBCEVs-miR-219/miR-338 significantly promoted OPC differentiation and maturation in vivo as evidenced by increased CC1 mature oligodendrocytes and reduced PDGFR undifferentiated OPCs (p < 0.001).

A perimeter derived complexity index was used to quantify tumoroid morphology and viability after exposure to cisplatin or the Notch modulators RIN1 (activator) and FLI 06 (inhibitor), which were assessed by live imaging and WST8 assays. ECM 2 medium alone produced compact CAF free spheroids, whereas ECM 2 supplemented with CAF medium generated invasive aggregates that deposited endogenous matrix; Matrigel plus this medium and single point seeding yielded the highest complexity scores. Two of the three patient tumoroids were cisplatin sensitive, and all showed significant growth inhibition with the FLI 06 inhibitor, while RIN1 induced minimal change. The optimised scaffold retains tumour stroma cross talk and affords patient specific drug response data within days, supporting personalised treatment selection in HNC.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

We previously identified the lipid hydrolase alpha/beta hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) as a key mediator of the development of metabolic syndrome and intimately involved in cell signaling, making it a prime target for investigation in MASLD-related HCC. ABHD6 displays higher expression within HCC tumor cores when compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissue in human subjects.

Additionally, a xenograft model using the human Huh7 cell line displayed reduced tumor engraftment and growth with ABHD6 genetic deletion and small molecule inhibition. ABHD6 knockout cells demonstrated increased levels of bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphates (BMPs), lipids relevant to high fat diet-induced lysosomal dysfunction, and knockout cells also demonstrated altered autophagy and lysosomal activity using in vitro model of saturated fatty acid-induced lipotoxicity.

Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) offers a platform for targeted drug delivery directly to isolated organs, minimizing systemic effects. This study evaluated the long-term anti-fibrotic efficacy and safety of galunisertib in discarded human kidneys perfused ex vivo. Methods: Twelve discarded human kidneys underwent 4 hours of oxygenated hypothermic perfusion followed by 6 hours of NMP with galunisertib or vehicle (n=6). Precision-cut kidney slices (PCKS) were then cultured for 48 hours with either continued or discontinued galunisertib exposure. Endpoints included fibrosis-related mRNA expression and pharmacokinetics. Results: Galunisertib did not negatively affect renal function during NMP. Continued exposure in PCKS significantly attenuated fibrosis-related mRNA expression, including SERPINE1 (p=0.0046), TGF-{beta} (p=0.0168), FN1 (p=0.0269) and ACTA2 (p=0.0014) after 48 hours. The discontinuation of treatment did not exhibit the same anti-fibrotic effects. Conclusion: Galunisertib was safely administered during NMP and steadily excreted via the urine. NMP showed to be a promising platform for safe targeted anti-fibrotic therapy delivery, offering potential to improve graft quality. When treatment was sustained, galunisertib induced a modest reduction in fibrosis-related mRNA expression over 48 hours of tissue incubation.

Our experiments show highest survival rate in 6-8 day-old larvae. Equilibration with cryoprotecting agents takes 1h in 5% (v/v) Me2SO + 0.1%(v/w) sucrose, followed by transfer to 0.25ml straws. The protocol cools larvae at 2,5C/min from 20C to -35C using a programmable freezer, followed by a rapid transfer to liquid N2. Larvae are thawed in a water bath at 18C.

The Drosophila melanogasterCyclin G gene (CycG) encodes a transcriptional cyclin that regulates growth and the cell cycle. Over-expression of a potentially more stable isoform of the protein (deleted of a PEST-rich domain, hereafter called CycGP) induces extreme wing size and shape FA (i.e. high developmental noise), indicating a major disruption of developmental stability. Previous attempts to identify the genetic bases of FA have been impeded by the constitutively low level of developmental noise, strongly limiting the power to detect any effect. Here, we leverage the extreme developmental instability induced by overexpression of CycGP to explore the genetic bases of FA: we perform a genome-wide screen for deficiencies that enhance or reduce CycGP-induced wing FA. 499 deficiencies uncovering 90% of the euchromatic genome were combined with a recombinant chromosome expressing CycGP. We identified 13 and 16 deficiencies that enhance and decrease FA, respectively. Analysis of mutants for some genes located in these deficiencies shows that Cyclin G ensures homogeneous growth of organs in synergy with the major morphogens of the wing, Dpp and Wg, as well as the Hippo and InR/TOR pathways. They also reveal that CycGP-induced FA involves Larp, a potential direct interactor of Cyclin G, that regulates translation at the mitochondrial membrane.

Though the genetic events regulating CRC with p53 loss/mutation have been documented, the epigenetic events accompanying the loss of p53 have not been well understood. Epigenome based classification of CRC tumours has identified the active enhancer mark as a distinct marker for progression, however the role of the distal regulatory regions upon p53 loss in CRC remains to be established. This work investigates the influence of p53 loss on enhancer regulation in colorectal cancer cells. Genome wide profiling of active enhancer mark, H3K27ac in p53wt and p53-/- CRC cells reveal an overall gain of this mark around the promoters and intronic regions. These active enhancers show strong association with oncogenes and hallmark MYC and E2F targets suggesting an enhancer mediated regulation of MYC/E2F pathway governed by E2Fs, MAZ and PATZ1. Interestingly, we also observed a gain in oncogenic super enhancers mediated by E2Fs/KLFs accompanying loss of p53. The promoters of histone methyl transferases EZH2 and SuV39H1 (E2F targets) show elevated levels of H3K27ac suggesting a novel epigenetic regulation of CRC around the promoters and distal regulatory regions. Our validation of these findings in p53 deficient colon cancer cohorts shows that the super enhancer associated genes align more to the CMS4 subtype and exhibit lower survivability. The observed cancer stemness and gain of oncogenic super enhancers with p53 loss presents a hitherto unexplored paradigm of enhancer mediated oncogenic progression which may be exploited for devising epigenetic therapy in p53-/- CRC patients.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Most prostate cancers are driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling, but there are an increasing number of cases that lose AR and gain neuroendocrine (NE) features (AR-/NE+) or lack both (AR-/NE-). These latter subtypes are particularly aggressive and lethal. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown great potential as biomarkers for noninvasive liquid biopsy assays, as EVs contain biomolecules from their cells of origin. Here, we used a shotgun proteomics approach with mass spectrometry to interrogate the global proteome of EVs isolated from prostate cancer cell lines reflecting diverse clinical subtypes, including AR-/NE+ and AR-/NE- models. We identified 3,952 EV proteins, which clustered largely by tumor subtype and provided enough proteomic coverage to derive classic gene signatures of AR or NE identity that are of high relevance for prostate cancer prognostication. EVs isolated from AR+ cells displayed high levels of proteins regulated by AR and mTOR signaling. EVs isolated from AR-/NE+ cells contained known NE markers such as SYP and CHGA, whereas EVs from AR-/NE- models were enriched in basal cell markers and proteins that regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We integrated our cell line data with recently published EV proteomics data from 27 advanced prostate cancer patients and found 2,733 overlapping proteins including cell surface markers relevant to prostate cancer, AR activity indicators, and proteins enriched in specific subtypes (AR+, AR-/NE-, AR-/NE+). This approach is especially promising for rare cancer subtypes, such as prostate cancers that lose AR-related features and gain NE features, so as to optimize the use of these liquid biopsy samples for clinical decision making.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) of valvular endothelial cells and osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells are crucial processes of CAVD. Smad3 and Runx2 are key transcription factors (TFs) that drive these processes by regulating gene expression and cellular functions. We hypothesize that downregulation of these TFs with nanoparticle-mediated RNA interference could mitigate aortic valve stenosis and calcification. METHODS: We engineered dual-targeted lipid-polymer hybrid nanocarriers (lipopolyplexes, LPP) to deliver short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) for gene silencing in pathologically remodeled aortic valve. The nanocarriers simultaneously target vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and collagen IV, enhancing specificity toward inflamed and fibrotic valvular tissue. Encapsulated shRNA constructs were designed to silence either Smad3 or Runx2 (yielding formulations V/Cp-LPP/shSmad3 and V/Cp-LPP/shRunx2). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a mouse model of atherosclerosis aggravated by diabetes, mimicking the pathological environment of CAVD. RESULTS: The dual-targeted lipopolyplexes effectively facilitated gene delivery to the aortic valve, ensuring efficient transfection. Treatment with V/Cp-LPP/shSmad3 and V/Cp-LPP/shRunx2 resulted in marked silencing of Smad3 and Runx2, accompanied by significant suppression of osteogenic markers, including osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin, as well as reduced ?SMA expression in valve tissue. Our data further identify Runx2 as a novel upstream modulator of Smad3 expression, unveiling a previously unrecognized Runx2-Smad3 regulatory axis with important implications for valvular pathology and targeted therapy. Beyond localized effects, systemic administration of these lipopolyplexes led to reduced plasma concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, and triglycerides, while maintaining hepatic and renal function, suggesting additional benefits on systemic metabolic homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the pivotal role of Smad3 and Runx2 downregulation in mitigating aortic valve calcification, unveiling both molecules as compelling therapeutic targets in CAVD.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

We conducted touch experiments with C. japonica and detected electrical signals generated by the contact of tendrils. We found that when the tendril contacted the stem and did not coil around it, the electrical signal was transmitted from the stem to the tendril.

Here, we conclude that it does not require much at all. It does not require knowing secondary structures; it does not require aligning the sequences; and it does not require many parameters. We selected a probabilistic model of palindromes (a stochastic context-free grammar or SCFG) with a total of just 21 parameters. Using standard deep learning techniques, we estimate its parameters by implementing the generative process in an automatic differentiation (autodiff) framework and applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We define and minimize a loss function that does not use any structural or alignment information. Trained on as few as fifty RNA sequences, the rules of RNA base pairing emerge after only a few iterations of SGD. Crucially, the sole inputs are RNA sequences. When optimizing for sequences corresponding to structured RNAs, SGD also yields the rules of RNA base-pair aggregation into helices. Trained on shuffled sequences, the system optimizes by avoiding base pairing altogether. Trained on messenger RNAs, it reveals interactions that are different from those of structural RNAs, and specific to each mRNA. Our results show that the emergence of canonical base-pairing can be attributed to sequence-level signals that are robust and detectable even without labeled structures or alignments, and with very few parameters. Autodiff algorithms for probabilistic models, such as, but not restricted to SCFGs, have significant potential as they allow these models to be incorporated into end- to-end RNA deep learning methods for discerning transcripts of different functionalities.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into chromatin, a regulatory nucleoprotein assembly. Establishment, maintenance, and interconversion of chromatin states is required for correct patterns of gene expression, genome integrity, and organismal survival. Transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin minimizes mobilization of transposable elements and limits expansion of other repetitive DNA, but mechanisms for recognition of the latter sequences are not well established. We previously demonstrated in Drosophila melanogaster that transcripts derived from 1360 and Invader4 transposon insertions can trigger local conversion of transcriptionally permissive euchromatin to heterochromatin through the piRNA system, but only in a subset of genomic locations near existing heterochromatin masses. Here we show that a ~9 kb tandem array of the 36-nucleotide lac operator (lacO) sequence of Escherichia coli can form ectopic heterochromatin at a similar subset of sites, resulting in variegating gene expression of an adjacent reporter gene. HP1a and histone deacetylation are required for lacO repeat-induced silencing, but in contrast with previously described Position Effect Variegation (PEV) we do not observe increased histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. Silencing is suppressed at lower temperatures (another striking contrast to canonical PEV, which is enhanced at lower temperatures), implying the involvement of a temperature-sensitive component. Temperature switching experiments show that lacO repeat-induced heterochromatin formation is reversible throughout larval development following an HP1a-dependent licensing step in the early embryo. We conclude that the Drosophila nucleus can recognize a completely foreign tandem repeat as a target for heterochromatin formation, but find that the heterochromatin structure established is distinct from that of endogenous tandem arrays.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

However, recent studies have shown that microbial technologies could be used to facilitate green hydrogen production. Based on these findings, this work primarily focused on utilizing farm soil, wastewater, anaerobic sludge and cow dung for the production of green hydrogen. A double chambered Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC) was coupled with a single chambered Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) for this work. In this experiment, the fuel cell produced an average potential difference of 118.9 +/- 0.001 mV over a period of 312 hours (13 days). The electrolysis cell also produced an average potential difference of 56.8 +/- 0.003 mV over the same period of time. The two chambers of the MEC which facilitated the electrolysis process were separated by a locally made Proton Exchange Membrane. Hydrogen gas was produced at an average rate of about 6.9 +/- 0.012 mL/day with the highest being 65.5 +/- 0.012 mL on day 9. Also, an average current of 0.22 +/- 0.006 micro amps flowed through the entire system and the total amount of hydrogen gas produced at the end of the experiment was approximately 96.8 +/- 0.012 mL. Based on this work, it is evident that green hydrogen can be produced by means of coupling microbial electrolysis cells with microbial fuel cells and utilizing farm soil, wastewater, anaerobic sludge and cow dung.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Combining high-throughput pKa prediction methods with AlphaFold models allows pH-dependence to be studied across a proteome. Here, two methods and a variety of features for detecting pH-dependence and charge burial that is physiologically relevant, have been applied to human proteins. Predictions are effective for a small benchmark subset of well-characterised proteins and, more broadly, identify an overlap between features associated with pH-dependence and enzymes and transporters. The most informative filters are those describing relatively buried ionisable groups, with pKas close to neutral pH and/or involvement in highly-coupled charge networks. The question is addressed of which human proteins not annotated as enzymes or transporters, are predicted to have these features of predicted pH-dependence and/or charge networking. A striking feature from gene ontology analysis of those proteins is a predicted enrichment at the cell periphery, in particular an association with cell adhesion, including protein families not currently known to exhibit pH-dependence. Gene ontology classifications that are depleted for proteins with buried charge networks and/or predicted functional pH-dependence, include some associated with ribosomal and nuclear structure. This overall result suggests a possible general resilience of some key processes to pH fluctuations, whilst not precluding specific instances where signalling pathways have evolved responses to pH changes. A drawback of the study is restriction to protomer models, thus omitting groups that mediate pH-dependence through burial at an interface.

Mouse models, such as Ldlr-/- mice that develop atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders when fed a high-fat diet (HFD), are indispensable for studying disease mechanisms and identifying potential biomarkers. Objectives: We aimed to profile the plasma proteins of a widely studied experimental atherosclerosis model with a primary goal to detect low-abundant proteins. Methods: Ldlr-/- mice were fed a chow diet or HFD or 3 (n = 27 per diet) or 6 months (n = 12 per diet). Plasma samples were processed using nanoparticle technology (Proteograph(R) XT Assay; Seer, Inc), and peptides were analyzed using the Orbitrap Astral (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data-independent acquisition mode. For tissue proteomics, ten aortas were pooled for n = 4 pools per diet and month, and n = 6 livers per diet and month. Peptides were analyzed on the Orbitrap Exploris 480 in data-dependent mode. Proteomes were queried against the Tabula Muris mouse single-cell, STRING, and Gene Ontology databases, and queried against a genome-wide association list of 419 risk loci for coronary artery disease. Results: We sequenced 5,080 plasma proteins, surpassing previous reports by 10-fold. The prototypical apolipoproteins and complement factors were the most intense proteins, whereas proteins associated with cytokine/chemokine signaling represent the previously uncharted mouse plasma proteome. We divided the proteome into quartiles (Q1-Q4) to monitor sweeping changes over time. Proteins with a sustained enrichment in HFD (n = 705) are indicative of liver cell subtypes (Tabula Muris). Whereas proteins that moved up from the lower quartiles - Q2 (n = 228), Q3 (115) and Q4 (63) - indicate leukocytes and fibroblasts, and endothelial cells; demonstrating that signatures of inflammation and endothelial activation increase with disease progression. Notably, 86 and 146 proteins were increased at 3 and 6 months, including MMP-12 and COL6A3. Classical apolipoproteins exhibited heterogeneous responses - SAA3 and APOC2 increased, while APOA1, APOE, and LCAT decreased with high-fat feeding, indicating impaired high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality. Proteins shared between plasma and aorta were enriched for extracellular matrix components, while those overlapping with liver reflected metabolic processes. Finally, 120 CAD-associated proteins from human GWAS were detected in Ldlr-/- plasma, of which 4, including lipoprotein lipase, exhibited an increase in abundance with HFD. Conclusions: Nanoparticle-dependent proteome enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry may allow us to identify novel plasma biomarkers in Ldlr-/- mice and facilitate monitoring of candidate proteins associated with human disease mechanisms in preclinical interventional studies, thereby opening new avenues for understanding disease pathology and uncovering understudied molecular contributors.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

The pathosystem involving interactions between Brassica napus and its pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae was studied. Using in silico analysis and ribosomal profiling, we identified three putative pathoPEPs produced by P. brassicae and their targeted plant miRNA genes.

Despite their long-standing observation, the molecular identity and function of these attachments remain poorly understood. Here, we identified two nanodomain-mediated mechanisms governing wall-membrane attachments: one dependent on the Cellulose Synthase Complex (CSC), whose density at the plasma membrane positively correlates with resistance to hyperosmotic stress, and the other on REMORIN (REM), which acts antagonistically to the CSC mechanism. Using proximity-labeling proteomics, we identified SHOU4/4L as REM-associated proteins that mediate this antagonism.

Here, we identify the matrix glycoprotein Fibrillin-1 (Fbn1) as a Notch-regulated, cell-autonomous effector, essential for maintaining quiescence in muscle stem cells. Known for its causal role in Marfan syndrome (MFS), a connective tissue disorder that also presents with skeletal muscle atrophy, Fbn1 emerges as a critical niche component that protects stem cells from aberrant growth factor signalling. We demonstrate that targeted deletion of Fbn1 in muscle stem cells leads to dose-dependent quiescence defects, characterized by loss of cellular projections, depletion of the stem cell pool, and decline in long-term muscle function. Consistently, human MFS muscle biopsies show abnormally activated satellite cells, implicating stem cell imbalance in the development of MFS-associated myopathy. Mechanistically, the loss of Fbn1 upregulates TGF{beta} signalling, and pharmacological inhibition of this pathway, using the Angiotensin Receptor blocker losartan, restores the cellular and physiological defects of mutant muscles. These findings reveal a new quiescence-preserving mechanism through extracellular matrix-mediated shielding from mitogenic signals, and position stem cell dysfunction as a driver of MFS myopathy.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Using time-lapse imaging, we found that Mito-L are formed when mitochondria undergo tubular-to-spherical transitions and then fuse together. Under HR-activating conditions, we found the mitophagy process itself is essential for Mito-L formation.

Tpm1 encodes an actin-binding protein that stabilizes actin filaments and influences cell adhesion, signaling, and actomyosin contractility. Murine Tpm1 deficiency enhances embryonic hemogenic endothelial cell specification, but it was unclear if these effects extended to postnatal hematopoiesis. We used Cdh5Cre or VavCre models to conditionally ablate Tpm1 in endothelium or hematopoietic cells. Both models produced knockout mice in normal Mendelian ratios with complete Tpm1 ablation in postnatal blood. Endothelial Tpm1 deletion increased hemogenic endothelial cell specification, but did not change hematopoietic progenitor cell production nor adult blood counts. This suggested separate roles for Tpm1 in the embryonic and adult blood systems. GWAS suggested genetic architecture specifically linking decreased TPM1 expression to increased platelet count. We examined platelet lifespan and function to explain these findings. Tpm1KO increased platelet lifespan and diminished adhesion to fibronectin and fibrinogen. Decreased platelet clearance could explain increased platelet count in GWAS. Platelet fibrin binding is necessary for blood clot contraction, which reduces vascular occlusion following initial hemostasis. Tpm1KO reduced clot contraction and enhanced clot formation with worsened vascular occlusion in a ferric chloride-induced stroke model. These findings reveal a new role for Tpm1 in platelet function, offering insight into how cytoskeletal regulation impacts human platelet traits and pointing to novel targets to modify stroke risk and thrombotic disease.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Understanding the role of soil microbes in mediating post-fire C cycling and recovery is an important step to predicting how these ecosystems will respond to novel wildfire regimes caused by climate change. Wildfires can cause large shifts in soil bacterial and fungal community composition that can persist for years post-fire. Less is known about the effects of fire on soil microbial community function, such as C use efficiency (CUE). In this study, we measured the effects of burning on substrate-specific CUE using a laboratory incubation of boreal forest soils. We amended burned and unburned soils with either 13C-labelled ground pine roots or glucose and measured the amount of added substrate C that was incorporated into microbial biomass C versus respired as CO2 in order to calculate CUE. Burning caused a decrease in the amount of soil microbial biomass and respiration derived from soil organic C. Glucose-specific CUE declined with burning, driven by a decrease in glucose-derived microbial biomass. This decrease in glucose-specific CUE following burning correlated with an increase in weighted mean predicted 16S rRNA gene copy number, raising the possibility of using copy number as a proxy for post-fire CUE in boreal forest soils. Overall, pine-specific CUE was lower than glucose-specific CUE, likely reflecting the difference in chemical complexity between the two substrates; burning had a much smaller effect on pine-specific CUE, highlighting the variability of CUE between substrates in burned soils.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Drosophila subobscura is a rare example of a species that performs nuptial gift giving, while the mating behaviors of the other two members of the D. subobscura species subgroup, D. madeirensis and D. guanche, remain largely unstudied. In the present study, we characterize and compare mating behaviors of three sibling species of the D. subobscura species subgroup, with the aim of providing a starting point for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying reproductive behavioral divergence in the D. subobscura subgroup. We find that D. madeirensis males exhibit a rich repertoire of courtship behaviors-very similar to that of D. suboscura-including tapping, midleg swinging, proboscis extension and nuptial gift giving. In contrast, D. guanche males perform only tapping and lack the other premating displays, yet they still copulate successfully. We postulate that female promiscuity has promoted the loss of multiple components of the male courtship repertoire in D. guanche. The relatively recent divergence among these species (~1.72 Myr between D. guanche and other two species) suggests that only a few genomic and neural changes underpin the striking differences in mating behavior within the subobscura species subgroup.

How do microbes that are physically confined to the gut lumen affect the systemic physiological process of ageing? In female Drosophila, we show that microbiota increase expression of the peptide hormone Tachykinin (Tk), which corresponds to reduced lifespan. Tk is required for microbiota to shorten lifespan, with knockdown rendering flies constitutively long-lived even in the presence of an intact microbiota. This lifespan extension does not come with canonical costs to fecundity or feeding, but impacts on triacylglyceride (TAG) storage suggest adaptive functions in metabolic homeostasis. In flies with defined (gnotobiotic) microbiotas, we show that we can model Tk-dependent effects of microbiota on lifespan and TAG by monoassociation with Acetobacter pomorum. These effects require Tk in the midgut, and the cognate TK receptor TkR99D in neurons, implicating a microbiota-gut-neuron relay. This relay also appears to compromise gut barrier function in aged flies, indicating roles in healthspan as well as lifespan. However, the effect of TkR99D is independent of its reported role in insulin signalling and adipokinetic hormone signalling which, respectively, are canonical regulators of lifespan and TAG metabolism, suggesting a non-canonical role for TkR99D elsewhere in the nervous system.

The results showed that forming a thioester bond between SUMO1 and Uba2 increases the FRET signal, indicating that the E1 heterodimer is more stable and bound to each other in SUMO and ATP. These results suggest that the qFRET method can be used to determine protein interaction affinity changes and track real-time changes in protein conformation and dynamics changes during biochemical reactions.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

However, its mechanistic effects on neuronal signaling and circuit function remain underexplored. We address this shortcoming by employing multi-neuronal imaging in the simple nematode C. elegans that allows measurement of neuron activity across the animal's entire head with single-cell resolution. Neuronal imaging during low dose ketamine induction reveals two distinct phases: an early/low dose state of hyperactive synchronized dynamics and late/higher dose state of system disorganization and spastic microscale motion. Specifically examining the activity of the NMDA-receptive interneuron AVA, we find it decouples from the system under low dose ketamine. These results are consistent with the clinical hypothesis that ketamine causes neuronal disinhibition through suppression of key inhibitory interneurons. We identify functional differences between low and high dose activity dynamics and elucidate a mechanism of action of ketamine in a complete, intact nervous system.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

In previous studies, we identified a new type of CD133+ intracellular vesicles, named intercellsome, which is implicated in direct cell-cell communication under stress conditions. However, the regulatory mechanism and biological significance of these CD133+ vesicles are largely unknown, highlighting a gap in understanding of this cellular communication mechanism. We show here that CD133 acts as a stress response marker in cancer cells, with its expression and vesicle formation significantly induced under MEK inhibitor-mediated proliferative stress. The CD133+ vesicles are essential for maintaining cell proliferation under stress conditions in vitro. Mechanistically, the MEKi activates the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, which promotes CD133 transcription, establishing a novel connection between YAP signaling and CD133+ vesicle biogenesis. Further, CD133 plays a critical role in YAP-driven liver cancer progression in mice. This study defines a critical role of CD133+ vesicles in stress response regulated by YAP, which advances the understanding of CD133 functions beyond its stem cell-associated roles and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention of liver cancer relapse.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Although microarrays and conventional RNA sequencing have identified E2 target genes, pre-designed probes and short read lengths are limited in accurately capturing complex transcript structures. Long-read RNA sequencing offers a solution by spanning entire transcripts, providing a more complete view of the transcriptome. Here, we employed nanopore long-read direct RNA sequencing (DRS) complemented with 3-end sequencing, in vitro experiments, and deep learning-based protein modeling to explore the intricate landscape of E2-responsive transcriptome and protein level implications. Our analysis revealed a range of E2-responsive non-coding and coding isoforms, including intronically polyadenylated (IPA) mRNAs. One of these IPA isoforms was detected for TLE1 (Transducin-like enhancer protein 1), which positively assists ERa;-chromatin interactions for a subset of E2 target genes. The IPA isoform produces a C-terminus truncated protein, lacking the WDR interaction domain, but retains dimerization/tetramerization capacity through its intact N-terminus Q-domain. Structural modeling and protein-based assays confirmed the truncated protein's dimerization potential and nuclear localization. Functional assays showed that overexpression of truncated TLE1 reduces the E2-induced upregulation of GREB1, an E2-responsive gene, thereby disrupting transcriptional regulation. Importantly, a lower IPA isoform ratio is associated with worse survival in ER+ patients, highlighting clinical relevance. Our study uncovers new layers of complexity in the E2-regulated transcriptome, providing insights into truncated proteins. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of gene regulation and may help the development of new therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

While most animal studies use sudden, extreme heat exposure, the systemic and pulmonary impacts of gradual heat exposures, reflective of real-world conditions, remain poorly characterized. This study examined the effects of acute, gradual extreme heat exposure to mice. Adult male and female C57Bl/6 mice were randomly assigned to heat-exposed, control, or pair-fed groups. Heat-exposed mice experienced a controlled 8-hour temperature ramp from 20{degrees}C to 38{degrees}C, mimicking the daily transition from nighttime lows to daytime highs. Control and pair-fed mice were maintained in parallel at ambient temperature. Multi-omics profiling was performed to assess cytokine levels in lung and serum, cecal microbiome composition, lung transcriptomics, and serum metabolomics. Heat exposure significantly altered the levels of multiple cytokines in serum and lung, including IL-17, MIP-1, MIP-1{beta}, IL-1, IL-12(p40), and RANTES, indicating shifts in mucosal immunity and immune cell recruitment. Random forest analysis identified 20 taxa that distinguished experimental groups, with a reduction in Lactobacillus observed in males. Lung transcriptomic analysis revealed immune-related gene expression changes involving B cell activation pathways. Serum metabolomics revealed significant decreases in ten metabolites across both sexes, identifying disruptions in amino acid and energy metabolism, with enrichment of the Glycine, Serine, and Threonine Metabolism KEGG pathway. Integrative network analyses revealed sex-specific correlations among immune genes, cytokines, and bile acid-related metabolites. These findings show that gradual extreme heat exposure triggers sex-specific systemic and pulmonary immunometabolic responses, offering insight into the biological effects of environmental heat stress and its potential health implications.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Subtype-specific transcription factor binding site (TFBS) variations within the LTR significantly influence latency and reservoir stability. In earlier work, we identified HIV-1C LTR variants with duplicated TFBS motifs, including NF-{kappa}B, AP1, RBEIII, and TCF-/LEF-1. Using five cell models, including Jurkat and primary CD4+ T cells, we compared canonical R-LTR and variant R2-LTR strains. Across sub-genomic reporters, single-round infections, and full-length viral vectors, we found that the balance between RBEIII and NF-{kappa}B motifs governs stability of latency. The two-viruses-one-cell system that normalized confounding environmental factors further revealed that latency is primarily controlled by intrinsic transcriptional circuits rather than external stimuli. In longitudinal studies of HIV-1C; individuals from acute and chronic infection phases, we observed dominant R strains during early infection and the spontaneous emergence of R2 strains in nearly half of chronic-phase subjects, a process accelerated by ART. Upon CD4+ T cell activation, R strains preferentially rebounded, while R2 strains showed strong resistance to reversal, even in subjects harbouring a co-infection. Together, these findings establish the clinical significance of LTR variation in latency regulation and identify the R2 phenotype as a critical determinant of reservoir persistence.

While two soluble pseudoproteases, CspC and CspA, were initially identified as the germinant and co-germinant receptors, respectively, in C. difficile, we previously identified residues in an unstructured region of CspC that regulate the sensitivity of C. difficile spores to both signals. However, the mechanism by which CspC transduces these signals remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CspC forms a stable complex with CspA and determine the crystal structure of the CspC:CspA heterodimer. The structure reveals extensive interactions along the binding interface, including direct interactions between the unstructured region of CspC and CspA. Using structure-function analyses, we identify CspC:CspA interactions that regulate the sensitivity of C. difficile spores to germinant signals and show for the first time that CspA regulates C. difficile response to not only co-germinant but also germinant signals. While we also show that CspA can form a homodimer and determine its crystal structure, CspA homodimerization appears unimportant for C. difficile spore germination. Collectively, our analyses establish the CspC:CspA heterodimer, rather than its individual constituents, as a critical signaling node for sensing both germinant and co-germinant signals. They also suggest a new mechanistic model for how C. difficile transduces germinant signals, which could guide the development of therapeutics against this important pathogen.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Lipid-specific {delta}13C analysis showed higher 13C incorporation from DI13C than from 13CH4. After 30 days, {delta}13C values were up to +417{per thousand} in SRB-specific fatty acids (e.g., C16:1{omega}5c, cyC17:0{omega}5,6) and +126{per thousand} in ANME-2-specific isoprenoid lipids (e.g., archaeol, crocetane). Based on these values, we calculated carbon assimilation rates and found that both partners primarily assimilate IC. Remarkedly, IC assimilation in SRB lipids was eight times higher than in ANME lipids, suggesting that ANME either rely on fixation of internally generated CO2 from 13C-label-free methane before it can be exchanged with the environment or they utilize an additional, yet unknown carbon source for lipid biosynthesis. By examining the step-wise 13C-enrichment of ANME- and SRB-derived lipids, we further delineate biosynthetic pathways for archaeal and bacterial diether lipid formation and highlight crocetane as a bilayer-modulating isoprenoid hydrocarbon potentially affecting membrane fluidity and proton permeability.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated how transcription and late replication influence replication origin activity by inserting an efficient minimal model origin into the avian DMD common fragile site (CFS) and a second transcriptionally silent late-replicating region. The DMD gene, which is neither transcribed nor fragile in wild-type DT40 cells, became fragile following transcriptional activation in a genetically engineered DT40 cell line. Previous molecular combing experiments have shown that transcription represses origin firing within the 500 kb 5' half of the gene. Here, we demonstrate that when a minimal origin is inserted into this repressive region, it remains partially active under basal transcription conditions but is fully inactivated upon transcriptional induction. In contrast, inserting the efficient {beta}-actin promoter/origin at the same site retains origin functionality despite transcriptional activation. Introducing these two origins into a late-replicating, transcriptionally silent locus reveals the same functional hierarchy. Notably, this contrasts with their comparable activity in a mid-late replicating region. These results define a class of replication origins capable of maintaining functionality across diverse chromosomal contexts. Our findings support the model in which CFSs arise due to transcription-dependent repression of replication origin initiation across large, late-replicating genes. Moreover, our results reinforce the idea that replication initiation in late-replicating genomic compartments is intrinsically less efficient than earlier-replicating regions.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Traditional diagnostic methods rely on egg sedimentation from faeces, a time-consuming methodology lacking sensitivity and specificity. This study aimed to develop and validate two diagnostic methods: firstly, qPCR for accurate identification of Fasciola spp., and secondly, tremabiome, deep amplicon sequencing technique for identifying fluke species using faecal egg DNA. Methodology: To detect fluke infection primers targeting mitochondrial DNA were repurposed to develop a SYBR Green qPCR diagnostic. For the identification of fluke species, a tremabiome approach was developed. A reference sequence library and taxonomy file were generated for 21 fluke species, enabling species sequence read separation and extracting amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). To validate the qPCR and tremabiome approach, 402 faecal samples were collected from cattle and sheep across the UK. Fluke eggs were isolated by sedimentation, detected by microscopy and qPCR, and tremabiome used to identify fluke eggs to species level. Results: qPCR demonstrated high analytical sensitivity, detecting Fasciola hepatica DNA down to 19.2fg and F. gigantica down to 6.4fg, with no cross-amplification of other flukes. Tremabiome was able to detect as few as five F. hepatica and Calicophoron daubneyi eggs and identify mixed infections. High levels of co-infection (14.4%) of F. hepatica and C. daubneyi were observed in faecal samples, followed by single infections with C. daubneyi (12.6%) and F. hepatica (3.2%). Notably, tremabiome detected F. hepatica in 20 samples missed by qPCR. Data analysis identified 55 and 32 ASVs for F. hepatica and C. daubneyi, respectively, with phylogenetic clustering within their respective clades. Conclusion: This study developed qPCR assay for Fasciola detection and validated a tremabiome deep amplicon sequencing for fluke species differentiation.

Versican, an extracellular matrix (ECM) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, coordinates the innate immune response in multiple experimental models. Versican's potential as an immunomodulatory molecule makes it a promising therapeutic target for controlling the host's immune response to lung infection. However, versican's contribution to lung inflammation, injury, and immune cell activity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a critical knowledge gap. To address our central hypothesis that mesenchymal-derived versican is pro-inflammatory and enhances the innate immune response to IAV infection, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse deficient in mesenchymal-derived versican (B6. Col1a2-CreERT+/-/Vcantm1.1Cwf, Col1a2/Vcan-/-). We report that mesenchymal-derived versican plays a critical role in neutrophil, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration into the lungs and airways early in IAV infection. Intriguingly, mesenchymal-derived versican deficiency had the most substantial negative impact on neutrophil emigration into the lungs. We found that neutrophils were less adhesive to the ECM of Col1a2/Vcan-/- mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs), which had a significant decrease in versican compared to wild-type mLFs. Additionally, Col1a2/Vcan-/- mLFs treated with poly(I:C) in vitro have reduced cell-associated hyaluronan. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived versican is necessary for adhesion to lung fibroblasts by neutrophils as they transit into the lung interstitium and airways from the pulmonary vasculature.

Historically, GWEP in endemic countries have focused on interrupting transmission of the disease through intervention such as isolation and management of patients, health education, provision of improved water sources and promotion of filtering drinking water to avoid ingestion of the copepod intermediate host (IH) that may contain infectious third-stage larvae. The recent shift of Guinea worm infections in animals - particularly domestic dogs - has introduced an additional challenge to the eradication program, underscoring the urgent need for diagnostics and therapeutics. Understanding the parasite biology and survival strategies in the mammalian host, the copepod IH, and fresh water is pivotal to identifying new control measures. Comparative transcriptomic analysis provides a powerful tool to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying parasite survival and adaptations. Here, we compared the transcriptome of adult gravid female and first-stage larvae (L1), the stage infective for the copepod IH. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of two adult females and their L1 revealed an upregulation of genes involved in translation, transcription, and DNA repair in L1, likely reflecting adaptations essential for survival in freshwater and subsequent infection of copepods. Additionally, genes involved in cuticle formation were upregulated in adult females highlighting the role of cuticle integrity in retaining millions of L1 until the gravid female worm emerges. We identified highly expressed genes in the adult female that may represent promising candidates for diagnostic markers.

Furthermore, we constructed two SpDis3L2 protein variants, harbouring single amino acid substitutions mimicking the ones already found in human patients, to test their catalytic activity in vitro. We highlight the A756R SpDis3L2 variant, which loses the ability to degrade double-stranded RNA substrates and accumulates intermediary degradation products when degrading single-stranded RNA substrates. As such, A756 seems to be a key residue responsible for the normal cellular function of Dis3L2, specifically regarding its important role in the degradation of structured RNA substrates.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce an in situ RNA imaging method based on split-probe ligation and rolling circle amplification (RCA) for profiling spatial gene expression. In this approach, split-probes hybridize to adjacent regions of a target RNA fragment and are then enzymatically ligated to form circular DNA templates, which are subsequently amplified via RCA to boost signal. We demonstrate that this method enables robust in situ RNA detection and genotyping in both tissue sections and whole-mount tissue samples. By coupling this technique with in situ sequencing, we mapped the spatial expression patterns of 82 genes in the kidneys of healthy and diabetic male and female mice. This analysis revealed distinct localization of Aqp4 in proximal tubules and principal cells of the collecting ducts, and uncovered sex-specific transcriptomic alterations in diabetic kidneys with spatial resolution.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

We report that yeast vacuoles produce PI(3,4,5)P3 from PI(4,5)P2 through class III PI 3-kinase activity. In vitro assays showed that adding dioctanoyl (C8) PI(3,4,5)P3 or the PI(3,4,5)P3-binding domain Grp1-PH blocked fusion. Furthermore, modifying endogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 with the phosphatase PTEN also blocked fusion.

Importantly, blocking or eliminating PI(3,4,5)P3 prevented the vertex enrichment of Ypt7 and the HOPS subunit Vps33. Finally, we show that the soluble SNARE Vam7 binds PI(3,4,5)P3 and that PTEN abolished trans-SNARE pairing between partner vesicles.

These are removed by a non-canonical splicing pathway in which the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex catalyzes intron excision and the resulting exons are subsequently ligated by the tRNA-ligase complex (tRNA-LC). Although recent studies have provided insights into the process of intron removal, the molecular mechanisms underpinning tRNA ligation by tRNA-LC remain elusive. The tRNA-LC is a hetero-pentameric protein assembly consisting of Ashwin, CGI-99, FAM98B, the DEAD-box helicase DDX1 and the catalytic subunit RTCB/HSPC117. Using cryo-EM, we have determined an atomic-resolution reconstruction of human tRNA-LC. We find that CGI-99, DDX1 and FAM98B form an alpha-helical bundle that contacts RTCB via an interface located on the opposite side from the location of the ligase active site and tethers DDX1 to the tRNA-LC via its C-terminal helix. FAM98B and CGI-99 extensively interact in an intricately co-folded heterodimer that clamps Ashwin in a pincer-like structure. Interaction analysis using structure-based mutants of tRNA-LC subunits supports the overall architecture of the complex. Finally, we show that the paralogous proteins FAM98A and FAM98C underpin the assembly of compositionally distinct RTCB-containing complexes that lack Ashwin and may have distinct cellular functions.

Efficient navigation of the combinatorial vastness of protein sequence space to identify functional variants remains a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches, which predominantly rely on template-based local search or single-residue mutagenesis, are constrained by their susceptibility to local optima and their potential risk of destabilizing native structural stability. In this study, we introduce ProtHMSO, a heuristic multi-site optimization framework leveraging masked protein language models (ProtLMs) for context-aware sequence exploration. ProtHMSO mimics natural evolutionary mechanisms by employing ProtLM-derived substitution probabilities to guide heuristic searches for synergistic mutations, thereby constraining combinatorial search spaces through evolutionary and biophysical priors. Given a starting sequence and a predictive fitness model, ProtHMSO heuristically generates high-fitness multi-site variants under evolutionary constraints. Besides, ProtHMSO can also be as a modular plugin that enhances the convergence efficiency of genetic algorithms (GAs) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) by integrating evolutionary priors into exploration strategies. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that protein sequences generated by ProtHMSO exhibit superior functional performance and closer alignment with natural sequence distribution, compared with state-of-the-art methods. These advancements highlight that ProtHMSO has strong potential and compatibility to accelerate functional protein discovery, offering a robust framework for efficient and context-aware exploration of protein sequence space.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Here we address this important open question comparing bone marrow-derived macrophages from susceptible hamsters (hamBMDMs) and resistant mice (mBMDMs) to identify intrinsic cellular features that may contribute to host-specific outcomes. We first optimized and validated an experimental protocol for generating hamBMDMs, which closely resemble classical mouse BMDMs in terms of morphology, marker gene expression and phagocytic activity. Comparative transcriptomic analysis uncovered rodent-specific, intrinsic differences in the expression of metabolic and immune-related pathways known to influence susceptibility to intracellular Leishmania infection. In vitro infection assays confirmed the microbicidal capacity of hamBMDMs, while also revealing their increased permissiveness to Leishmania proliferation. In conclusion, the combined use of murine and hamster macrophage systems provides a powerful platform to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying L. donovani survival and host resistance. Our improved protocol allows for the generation of large quantities of functionally validated hamster macrophages, enabling systems-level investigations in this important rodent model that more accurately reflects human infection dynamics than mice.

Epidemiological data links DM to heightened CHIKF severity and a greater risk of developing chronic arthropathy, yet the mechanism underpinning this association remains poorly understood. In this study, we established an in vivo streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice as a model to investigate the impact of DM on CHIKV pathogenesis. STZ induces selective pancreatic {beta}-cell destruction and persistent hyperglycemia. Diabetic animals infected with CHIKV exhibited aggravated joint inflammation, increased nociceptive sensitivity, and elevated serum markers of muscle and hepatic injury, including creatine kinase (CK) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Histopathological analyses revealed that CHIKV infection alone disrupted joint architecture. However, in the diabetic context, these alterations were significantly exacerbated, with enhanced inflammatory infiltrates, chondrocyte loss, osteocyte necrosis, and fibrotic remodeling. These results demonstrate that the diabetic metabolic environment profoundly amplifies CHIKV-induced tissue damage and impairs resolution of inflammation, offering a plausible mechanistic explanation for the poorest CHIKF outcomes observed in diabetic patients. Thus, this model provides a valuable platform for exploring the molecular drivers of CHIKF severity and chronicity, especially among DM patients, as well as for development of pharmacological tools to mitigate CHIKV-associated complications in metabolically vulnerable populations.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

ASW displays a dual nuclear localisation signal (NLS) which, upon disruption, leads to the retention of the tRNA-LC in the cytoplasm with a consequent impairment of pre-tRNA splicing and accumulation of tRNA fragments. We also show that the tRNA-LC exists in three forms depending on which FAM98 paralog is chosen, either FAM98A, FAM98B or FAM98C. We find that ASW interacts exclusively with the FAM98B-containing complex, allowing its nuclear localization for tRNA biogenesis. Attaching an NLS to RTCB, the catalytic and indispensable subunit, rescues pre-tRNA splicing in cells depleted of ASW. We envision that vertebrates evolved ASW to localize a sub-population of tRNA-LC to the nucleus, while using FAM98 paralogs to retain a fraction of RTCB in the cytoplasm for XBP1-mRNA splicing during UPR.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

We sought to establish the nature of a pluripotent stem cell niche using planarian flatworms, animals that maintain pluripotent stem cells throughout adulthood and use them for whole-body regeneration. We characterized the cellular microenvironment of planarian stem cells in detail, finding that each stem cell is surrounded by a diverse mixture of other stem cells and differentiated cells. We identified phagocytic cells marked by CTSL2 as the differentiated cell type most frequently found next to stem cells, in both homeostasis and regeneration. CTSL2+ cells, which we named abracada cells, wrap around stem cells, and then neighbor progenitors less often coincident with their specialization. We then tested whether abracada cells constitute a functional niche that regulates stem cells.

Here, we created a collection of chromosome-length, whole genome sequences from 10 Dictyostelium discoideum isolates and sister species to understand the evolution of the large tgr gene family. Our dataset includes AX2-214, a widely used D. discoideum lab strain, as well as complete genomes for two Chlamydia-like endosymbionts harbored within amoebae. We find that tgrB1 and C1 lie in a hypermutational hotspot, with haplotypes that undergo repeated intralocus recombination, duplications, transpositions, and inversions. These structural dynamics are highly localized adjacent to tgrB and C, resulting in the gain and loss of dozens of genes. The tgrBC genes themselves frequently duplicate and recombine, leading to the rapid generation of unique tgrBC repertoires. In the broader tgr gene family, some genes (e.g. tgrN) are single copy and syntenic across all the genomes, whereas others (e.g. tgrA) prolifically duplicate at similar rates to Dictyostelium transposons. Thus, the tgr genes are among the most rapidly evolving families genome-wide. We propose that the intense diversification within the tgrBC locus can help explain how these genes acquire such extreme levels of polymorphism, with parallels to the MHC immune genes in mammals and other allorecognition systems.

Emerging evidence suggests that each ploidy state contributes to regeneration in an injury-specific manner. We hypothesized that diploid hepatocytes promote healing after acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. Approach & Results: To study ploidy populations in vivo, we utilized mice with a lifelong liver-specific knockout of E2f7/E2f8 (LKO), which are enriched in diploid hepatocytes (>70%) but otherwise normal. Control and LKO mice were treated with APAP (300 or 600 mg/kg), and injury was assessed over 0-96 hours. Although both groups sustained injury, LKO mice showed improved survival, lower serum liver enzyme levels, and reduced necrosis and DNA fragmentation, indicating resistance to APAP-induced injury. To determine if resistance was due to E2f7/E2f8 loss or increased diploidy, we deleted E2f7/E2f8 in adult hepatocytes (HKO), a model that does not alter ploidy. Injury was similar between controls and HKO, ruling out gene deletion as the protective factor. Transcriptomic and protein analyses revealed minimal baseline differences; however, following APAP treatment, LKO livers exhibited reduced JNK activation and less mitochondrial injury. Finally, APAP-treated wild-type hepatocytes exhibited a shift toward lower ploidy, supporting the idea that diploid cells are more resistant to injury. Conclusions: Diploid hepatocytes resist APAP-induced liver injury through reduced JNK activation and mitochondrial damage. These findings highlight hepatocyte ploidy as a key determinant of injury response and suggest a protective role for diploid hepatocytes in promoting liver resilience and regeneration.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Capturing the temporal dynamics of cardiac- and respiratory-driven brain pulsations (0.2-1.5 Hz) requires fast imaging with TRs near 100 ms, which is often unachievable in functional MRI or dynamic diffusion MRI. As a result, valuable physiological information remains hidden in these datasets. Here, we introduce TRACC-PHYSIO, a time-domain analytical framework designed to quantify physiological coupling and pulse time delays in dynamic MRI without requiring a fast acquisition. TRACC-PHYSIO uses cross-correlation to detect co-fluctuations between slowly sampled dynamic MRI data and simultaneously recorded physiological waveforms. It measures two key metrics: the peak Coupling Coefficient (peak CorrCoeff), quantifying the strength of co-fluctuations, and the TimeDelay, reflecting the relative arrival time of the physiological impulse in the brain with millisecond-level temporal resolution. The primary aim of this study is to validate TRACC-PHYSIO through systematic simulations that model realistic dynamic MR signals with mixed physiological components. We comprehensively evaluate TRACC-PHYSIO's performance under a wide range of conditions, including varying cardiac-to-respiratory composition ratios, TRs, and acquisition times. Results demonstrate that TRACC-PHYSIO can robustly assess coupling strengths and time delays for both cardiac (TRACC-Cardiac) and respiratory (TRACC-Respiratory) components, even in datasets with long TRs up to 3 seconds. By enabling a reliable time-domain coupling analysis, TRACC-PHYSIO opens new avenues for revealing brain pulsation mechanisms and elucidating the physiological drivers of neurofluid dynamics in health and disease. This stimulation study provides a valuable reference for interpreting TRACC-PHYSIO results and understanding associated uncertainties in future applications.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

However, the development of such sensors has been impeded by the lack of generalizable tools for the efficient discovery and optimization of aptamer beacons for diverse molecular targets. Here, we present a scalable approach for converting existing strand-displacement aptamer switches into aptamer beacons by introducing targeted mismatches within their non-target-binding stem domain, destabilizing the aptamer structure to an extent that it can only refold upon binding its target. In order to perform this screening in a high-throughput fashion, we have developed the Massively-parallel Aptamer Performance Analyzer (MAPA), an automated, fluorescence-based screening platform based on a reconfigured sequencing instrument that can functionally evaluate millions of aptamer variants in parallel. Using MAPA, we identified multiple aptamer beacons for glucose, serotonin, and dopamine, and demonstrated that these beacons retain their sensing performance when translated from the on-chip surface-based MAPA format to a solution-based assay. We performed all three aptamer beacon experiments on a single MAPA chip, and even greater multiplexing should be possible, greatly accelerating the discovery of aptamer-based sensors for real-time molecular detection.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Only by accident do we discover adaptive, dynamic receptor-drug interactions that allow for rational design.

In this context, several strategies and methods have been developed to limit those effects, either by monitoring the data generation process to maximize reproducibility or by applying post-analysis data correction. Different evaluation frameworks, either assessing the degree of bias in the data through visual tools or quantitative indicators, or evaluating the prediction performance of known biomarkers, were also proposed. However, there is currently no clear consensus on how to evaluate batch correction methods. This work offers a strategy to assess multiple dimensions of batch correction efficiency within a comprehensive and reliable framework, designed to assess the effectiveness and reliability of batch correction methods. Based on Mahalanobis Conformity Index (MCI), it provides a multivariate and covariance-aware metric to quantify within- and between-batch variability. Additionally, it combines visualization techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate INTegrative (MINT) PCA) with numerical indicators (batch dispersion, Coefficient of Variation), supporting both multidimensional and metabolite-specific evaluations. Lastly, this novel approach integrates statistical tools alongside chemistry-based metrics for method overfitting and overcorrection assessment.

The czcD (NiCo) transcription riboswitch specifically senses Co2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+ ions at micromolar concentrations amid millimolar Mg2+. We used computer simulations with multi-resolution RNA models to understand how global conformational changes in the NiCo riboswitch are coupled to the remarkable specific binding of Co2+. We show that the riboswitch folds through an intermediate state, where a partially folded four-way junction (4WJ) creates an anionic pocket large enough to accommodate the binding of solvated divalent ions. The binding of Co2+ is coupled to the stability of the weak non-canonical G{middle dot}A base pairs at the helical junction that drive the formation of native-like coaxial stacking of four helices. The Co2+ binding further twists the 4WJ, which locks the ions in the bound state. Electronic structure calculations show that enhanced orbital interactions between conserved guanines in the 4WJ and Co2+ are responsible for the high specificity of the riboswitch in binding to Co2+ over Mg2+.

While large eccDNA (ecDNA) contributes to tumorigenesis, the role of smaller eccDNA (<100,000 base pairs) in cancer remains unclear. Our analysis of 25 colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors and adjacent non-tumorous tissues revealed that eccDNA is significantly more abundant in tumor tissues, correlating strongly with chromosomal amplifications. The presence of whole intact genes on 1.29% of eccDNA was non-random. We identified 84 genes that recurred across tumors of multiple patients when present on eccDNA with 19% of genes being cancer-associated. eccDNA-borne genes were often accompanied by increased expression, and their contribution to expression was much larger than that from linear amplifications and the larger ecDNA. The cytokine gene CXCL5 exemplified this phenomenon, showing substantial copy-number increase and upregulation when present on eccDNA. Functional validation in cell lines showed that CXCL5 eccDNA enhanced transcriptional output and immune cell recruitment function. The recurrence and overexpression of CRC-related genes on eccDNA indicate their selection in tumors, suggest eccDNA can serve as a novel mechanism for dynamically influencing gene expression and is capable of conferring cancer phenotypes to cells. Analysis of chromatin landscapes revealed that eccDNA preferentially forms at sites of open chromatin and active transcription, with architectural boundaries marked by CTCF protein. Clinically, patients with higher eccDNA levels showed poorer relapse-free survival. These findings suggest that circular DNA elements across the entire size spectrum participate in cancer evolution, positioning eccDNA as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Heterozygous loss of Pten in two constitutive SHH-MB mouse models increases penetrance and excellerates onset of differentiated tumors. We used a sporadic mouse model of SHH-MB expressing oncogenic SmoM2 in cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) and scRNA-seq to delineates cellular and transcriptional changes that accelerate tumor growth and cause differentiation. Homozygous but not heterozygous loss of Pten leads to rapid acceleration of tumor growth and end stage disease before 40 days, compared to ~25% survival in control SmoM2 mice at 100 days. Heterozygous PTEN mutations therefore should primarily negatively impact disease outcome when the mutations are germline. Loss of Pten in normal or SmoM2-expressing GCPs increases proliferation and enhances their progenitor state initially but by 12 days Pten mutant SmoM2 tumors are highly differentiated due to increased survival of non-proliferating GCPs. Furthermore, macrophage infiltration and cytotoxicity is reduced in differentiated regions of tumors lacking Pten, indicating cell nonautonomous change contribute to accelerated tumor growth.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Hemoglobin is traditionally recognized for its role in oxygen transport within erythrocytes, but its expression in other cell types has been documented. We have recently discovered hemoglobin alpha a1 (Hb-a1 mRNA and Hb protein) in T-lymphocytes and previously reported that its expression was sensitive to mitochondrial redox perturbations. However, outside of its incidence and basic characterization, the functional role of Hb in T-lymphocytes remained unknown. Herein, we identify Hb in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte subsets, and found its expression is highly dynamic, differs between the two subtypes, and is dependent upon activation stage. Further, the loss of Hb impairs mitochondrial function, dysregulates cytokine production, and lowers the activation threshold primarily in CD4+ T-lymphocytes, indicating a critical role for Hb within this subset. While these data suggested the loss of Hb in T-lymphocytes may promote aberrant activation of autoreactive T-lymphocytes, surprisingly, we discovered that mice lacking Hb in T-lymphocytes exhibited reduced severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) compared to wild-type control animals. Interestingly, T-lymphocytes lacking Hb in vivo appeared to function identically to wild-type controls, which did not explain the protection against EAE. In contrast, T-lymphocyte Hb knock-out mice displayed significantly reduced levels of circulating immunoglobulins and CD40L expression compared to their wild-type counterparts during EAE, suggesting impaired intercellular communication.

Many of these apparently immunocompetent patients are subsequently found to have autoantibodies against the pleiotropic cytokine GM-CSF. In this study, we investigated the potential role of GM-CSF (or CSF2) in the host response to C. gattii using a murine model of infection. Interestingly, infected Csf2-/- mice were found to have significantly improved survival and decreased lung fungal burden compared to wild type (WT) mice. We determined that during C. gattii infection, GM-CSF promotes the differentiation of monocytes into alveolar and interstitial macrophages. When these macrophages are ablated in CCR2-DTR+ mice, there is a corresponding improvement in survival with decreased lung fungal burden, thus phenocopying Csf2-/- mice. WT bone marrow-derived macrophages challenged with C. gattii have poor antifungal activity, suggesting that monocyte-derived macrophages (moMacs) are rendered permissive for fungal proliferation. Therefore, GM-CSF and moMacs mediate immune responses that are harmful to the host. We further found that GM-CSF and moMacs preferentially promote the influx of eosinophils over neutrophils into the infected lung. This eosinophilia is associated with substantial inflammatory lung pathology. Ablation of neutrophils using Mrp8cretg iDTR+ mice significantly increased C. gattii burden in the lungs, indicating that GM-CSF and moMacs block the entry of these beneficial, fungal-clearing granulocytes during infection.

E2F1 serves as a master regulator of the endocycle in Drosophila salivary glands, whereas the TOR signaling pathway controls the levels of the E2F1 protein post-transcriptionally. Cellular growth in tissues that undergo the endocycle is also dependent on nutrient availability. Drosophila Spargel (dPGC-1) is orthologous to a group of transcriptional co-activators in vertebrates known as PGC-1. In flies, Spargel influences cell growth through the Insulin signaling pathway via TOR. However, the mechanisms by which Spargel regulates endocycle-mediated growth have yet to be established. Here, we report an essential role of Spargel in the Drosophila larval salivary gland, which influences E2F1-mediated cellular growth. To elucidate the role of Spargel in the salivary gland, we performed FLP/FRT-mediated clonal analysis and found that a cell-specific loss of Spargel leads to smaller nuclei with reduced DNA content due to the early termination of DNA replication. Further, the selective absence of Spargel abrogates the expression of a key DNA replication factor called E2F1, which promotes G1[-&gt;]S transition in endocycle. Thus, mechanistically, Spargel plays a key role in cell growth by positively influencing the endocycle process through the E2F1 pathway.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Perturbations in retinal development contribute significantly to congenital and acquired forms of blindness, underscoring the necessity of elucidating human retinal ontogeny. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal organoids have emerged as a powerful model capable of self-organizing and recapitulating key aspects of retinal morphogenesis, offering valuable insights into retinal development and disease. Despite their utility, the extensive cellular heterogeneity, dynamic state transitions, and existence of unique, the development of this system has not yet been fully resolved, posing significant challenges for interpreting their developmental fidelity and therapeutic applicability. Here, we present the Human Retinal Organoid Cell Atlas (HROCA), a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic reference spanning retinal organoid development from Day 10 to Day 365, integrating data from 15 studies, 71 batches, and encompassing 458,309 cells. HROCA provides a detailed benchmark for organoid differentiation, identifying known retinal cell classes and novel cellular states at single-cell resolution. By associating HROCA with the human fetal retina atlas (HFR), we offer an in-depth comparison between in vitro and in vivo retinal development, revealing protocol-specific differences, limitations in neuronal maturation, and developmental timing discrepancies. HROCA expands our understanding of retinal developmental plasticity, highlighting unique cell populations such as chimeric, non-canonical, and apatride cells, which do not conform to classical retinal cell types but exist consistently across developmental timelines in vitro. This atlas serves as a crucial resource for understanding retinal development, evaluating organoid models, and guiding future improvements in regenerative medicine strategies.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Our objectives include: (i) to ascertain which LNRS area match the current recording scheme based on Watsonian vice-counties; (ii) to produce data-driven draft lists for each LNRS area, (iii) to compare this list in the Tees Valley area with a species list derived from expert knowledge. Using an inclusion threshold at 90% of surface area, we found that 20 out of the 48 LNRS areas are compatible with the vice-county-based scheme. We determine that LNRS areas included on average 9.3 (+/- 6.9) species threatened by extinction, a supplementary 3.6 (+/- 3.4) species near threatened and, adding nationally rare or scarce species, a total of 66.3 (+/- 35.1) species. A case study based on the Tees Valley revealed an overall good match between data and expert driven species lists, despite discrepancies relating to geographical attributions near boundaries and additional species solely selected by expert opinion.

However, outcomes are often unpredictable, and effective ecological monitoring is critical for understanding impacts. Integrating environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding with other non-invasive tools may help provide more comprehensive assessments of taxonomic and functional diversity and trophic complexity. We applied an integrated monitoring approach at a rewilding site in Scotland, comparing vertebrate diversity detected by metabarcoding four eDNA sample types (water, soil, tree rolling, scat) with passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and camera trapping. Each method was evaluated for taxonomic richness, community composition, functional diversity using trait-based analyses, and trophic complexity through co-occurrence networks. The comparative effectiveness of these methods is rarely explored beyond basic taxonomic diversity metrics. In total, 79 vertebrate taxa were detected: PAM captured 52 taxa, eDNA 44, and camera traps 17. Of the eDNA substrates, water and tree-rolling samples had the highest richness. Each method detected unique species, with birds and bats best covered by PAM, and small mammals by eDNA. Community composition varied between methods, with eDNA substrates capturing broader communities. PAM revealed the most pronounced community differences between wooded and open habitats. Tree rolling and water eDNA captured the greatest functional diversity, while PAM showed higher redundancy, detecting species with similar ecological roles. No single method captured all functional traits. Integrating eDNA methods with PAM produced the most complete trophic network. PAM provided the most complete network but missed key terrestrial interactions that were filled by eDNA. Synthesis and applications: Our findings highlight the necessity of an integrated multi-method toolkit for practitioners to comprehensively capture vertebrate richness, functional diversity, and trophic complexity, particularly in rewilding contexts. We recommend combining PAM with either tree rolling or water eDNA sampling as an optimal monitoring strategy, balancing their complementary strengths in taxonomic and functional coverage.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Yet, the importance of thermal adaptation of RMR in controlling individual response to warming still requires to be elucidated. Here, we investigated physiological mechanisms underlying thermal adaptation in two Daphnia magna lines with contrasting thermal preferences, focusing on RMR but also energy use efficiency (EUE) over a large thermal gradient. Using structural equation modelling we showed that adaptation of EUE between the cold and warm lines was able to mitigate the consequences of RMR thermal variability on individuals growth rate. These findings highlight the pivotal role of EUE in ectotherm thermal adaptation, offering key insights to predict the metabolic response of these ectotherms to climate change. Under a context of global warming, ectotherms metabolic response is critical as energy balance and allocation within individuals have repercussions on energy transfers within food web.

Reintroducing deep-rooted perennials to cultivated land may help to mitigate SOC loss and restore ecosystem function. We quantified the effect of replacing shallow-rooted annual crops with a deep-rooted perennial grass, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), by comparing 10 to 30 year-old switchgrass stands with paired annual row crop fields across the central and eastern USA. We hypothesized that switchgrass would store more root C and SOC than neighboring shallow-rooted annual crops, and that these effects would extend deeper than 30 cm. We also evaluated whether switchgrass stimulates decomposition of SOC at depth using radiocarbon (14C) to quantify replacement of slow cycling isotopically depleted SOC. Finally, we explored whether the effect of switchgrass on SOC is moderated by soil chemical and physical properties. While the effect of switchgrass on SOC in the surface 100 cm was positive at most sites, the average effect was highly uncertain and statistically indistinguishable from zero (mean difference in SOC = 0.6 kg C m-2 [95% CI -0.8 to +1.9 kg C m-2]). By contrast, we found that root biomass C was consistently more deeply distributed and more abundant under switchgrass, yielding an estimated additional 0.6 kg C m-2 in the surface 100 cm of soil under switchgrass [95% CI +0.5 to +0.7 kg C m-2]. 14C measurements suggested that root C inputs were adding to existing SOC without stimulating decomposition. The effect of switchgrass on belowground C was not strongly related to any of the environmental factors that we evaluated.

To answer these questions, we genotyped eleven populations of three-spined stickleback in a regulated river system and collected data on river morphology, connectivity, flow regimes, physico-chemistry and parasite abundance through a combination of field surveys and modelling. Gene-environment association analysis detected strong signals of genetic divergence associated with hydraulic features.

Using longitudinal in vivo imaging, histological and immunohistochemical analysis, qRT PCR, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA seq), snATAC seq (single nucleus Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) and spatial transcriptomics (GeoMx DSP), we identified early and progressive photoreceptor loss in Mfrp-/- mice, beginning by 28d. Retinal thinning and autofluorescent deposits in Mfrp-/- mice were accompanied by decreased expression of rod and cone opsins. Transcriptomic profiling by snRNA seq revealed distinct, photoreceptor-specific gene expression changes, including early upregulation of inflammatory and stress-related genes and later downregulation of genes involved in chromatin remodeling, synaptic function, and neurodevelopment. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) revealed disruptions in mitochondrial function, mTORC1 signaling, and G protein coupled receptor pathways. These findings define a temporally and spatially coordinated program of degeneration triggered by Mfrp loss and demonstrate that Mfrp is required for the maintenance of photoreceptor integrity and gene regulatory homeostasis during retinal development.

This study investigates the genomic prediction (GP) of fertility traits in Holstein heifers using both machine learning (ML) and conventional methods, based on data from SNP arrays and low-coverage sequencing data. In this study, we collected 45,320 Holstein heifers with phenotype and pedigree records, from which we generated genomic data for 3,683 Holstein heifers using lcGWS. We first estimated the heritability for age at first service (AFS), gestation length (GLh) and age at first calving (AFC). We then compared the prediction performance of ML methods, kernel ridge regression (KRR), support vector regression, and random forest regression, with GBLUP, ssGBLUP and BayesR3 regarding GP accuracy and unbiasedness. Inputs for ML includes genomic relationship matrices (GRM), principal components, and SNPs. The results revealed that the heritability for the three fertility traits ranged from 0.09 to 0.48. Prediction accuracy from imputed low-coverage sequencing data was comparable to that from standard SNP chips.

We sought to address this potential barrier to AAV gene therapy by furthering our understanding of AAV-ECM interactions. We hypothesized that both the AAV serotype and ECM composition will impact AAV transport and gene delivery. Methods: AAV2, AAV6, and AAV8 viral vectors were fluorescently labeled to allow for visualization of their diffusion through the ECM. Lung, liver, and small intestinal submucosal dECM hydrogels were formulated as models of the ECM with tissue-specific biomolecular content. We then characterized AAV and nanoparticle diffusion within decellularized ECM using fluorescent video microscopy and multiple particle tracking. Additionally, we evaluated AAV transduction in dECM-incorporated 2D and 3D spheroid tissue culture models. Results: All AAV displayed reduced diffusivity through ECM as compared to similarly sized nanoparticles. AAV2 diffusion was least affected by the presence of ECM across tissue types as compared to AAV6 and AAV8. AAV transduction in dECM incorporated in vitro models was significantly reduced in both a 2D and 3D setting.

Despite advancements in sequencing technologies that have significantly enhanced our knowledge of effector protein diversity and structure, the molecular mechanisms underlying their interactions with human host proteins remain unclear. Experimental approaches to validate these interactions are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and insufficient to comprehensively map the extensive effector-host protein interaction (PPI) network.

A non-canonical variant of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, characterized by mitochondrial-to-cytosolic citrate export, has emerged as critical for embryonic stem cell differentiation. However, its role in cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we present a two-step computational framework to systematically analyze the activity of this non-canonical TCA cycle across over 500 cancer cell lines and investigate its role in shaping hallmarks of malignancy. First, we applied constraint-based modeling to infer cycle activity, defining two complementary metrics: Cycle Propensity, measuring the likelihood of its engagement in each cell line, and Cycle Flux Intensity, quantifying average flux through the reaction identified as rate-limiting. We identified distinct tumor-specific patterns of pathway utilization. Notably, cells with high Cycle Propensity preferentially rerouted cytosolic citrate via aconitase 1 (ACO1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), promoting alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) and NADPH production. Elevated engagement of this cycle strongly correlated with Warburg-like metabolic shifts, including decreased oxygen consumption and increased lactate secretion. In the second step, to uncover non-metabolic transcriptional signatures associated with non-canonical TCA cycle activity, we performed machine learning-based feature selection using ElasticNet and Random Forest, identifying robust gene signatures predictive of cycle activity. Over-representation analysis revealed enrichment in genes involved in invasiveness, angiogenesis, stemness, and key oncogenic pathways. Analysis of DepMap gene dependency data revealed that TCA cycle activity correlates with differential vulnerability to perturbation of these oncogenic pathways, reinforcing the functional relevance of identified transcriptional signatures. To further interpret the predictive models, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was applied to prioritize genes contributing most to non-canonical cycle activity, suggesting novel candidates for experimental investigation. Overall, our framework enables comprehensive analysis of non-canonical TCA cycle dynamics and uncovers potential links between metabolic plasticity and malignant phenotypes.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

CD276 (B7-H3), an immune checkpoint glycoprotein frequently overexpressed in aggressive tumours, is extensively modified by glycosylation, a process known to regulate protein stability, localization, and immune interactions. However, its glycosylation-dependent functions in CRC remain unclear. This study shows that poor-prognosis CRC tumours exhibit dysregulated glycogene expression, leading to an immature O-glycosylation phenotype that enhances malignancy. Using C1GALT1 knockout CRC cells, which recapitulate the cancer glycocalyx, it was demonstrated that this glycosylation shift promotes proliferation and invasion. We further identify CD276 as a metastasis-associated glycoprotein whose function is shaped by O-glycan modifications. Mechanistically, immature O-glycosylation of CD276 enhances invasion, suppresses T-cell activation, and induces an immunosuppressive cytokine milieu, reinforcing its role in tumour immune escape. These findings establish CD276 as a glycosylation-dependent immune checkpoint and a promising therapeutic target to overcome immune evasion in CRC.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

X.; Madden, B.; Charlesworth, C.; Hitosugi, T.; Favier, J.; Maher, L. J.", "abstract": "Background: The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) are key metabolic pathways required for cellular ATP production. While loss of components in these pathways typically impairs cell survival, such defects can paradoxically promote tumorigenesis in certain cell types. One such example is loss of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which functions in both the TCA cycle and as Complex II of the ETC. Deleterious mutations in SDH subunits can cause pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), rare hereditary neuroendocrine tumors of chromaffin cells in the adrenal gland and the nerve ganglia, respectively. Why tumor formation upon SDH loss is limited to certain tissues remains unclear. We hypothesized that the metabolic and proteomic perturbations resulting from SDH loss are cell-type specific, favoring survival of chromaffin cells. Methods: We comprehensively examined the proteomic, acetylproteomic, and succinylproteomic effects of SDH loss in two cell models, immortalized mouse chromaffin cells (imCCs) and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs). Perturbations in metabolite levels were determined by mass spectrometry. Effects of SDH loss on fatty acid {beta}-oxidation (FAO) were assessed by stable isotope tracing and pharmacologic inhibition. Results: SDH-loss imCCs show significant upregulation of mitochondrial proteins, including TCA cycle and FAO enzymes, with pronounced downregulation of nuclear proteins. Both imCCs and iMEFs demonstrate significant energy deficiency upon SDH loss, but FAO activity is uniquely increased in SDH-loss imCCs. While SDH loss increases both lysine-reactive acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, SDH-loss imCCs and iMEFs show disproportionate hyperacetylation but mixed succinylation. Surprisingly, SDH-loss imCCs, but not iMEFs, display disproportionate hypoacetylation and hyposuccinylation of mitochondrial proteins. Conclusions: SDH loss differentially impacts the proteomes and acylproteomes of imCCs and iMEFs, with compartment-specific effects. These findings reveal cell type-specific adaptations to SDH loss. The plasticity of the response of imCCs may underlie the tissue-specific susceptibility to tumorigenesis and could illuminate therapeutic vulnerabilities of SDH-loss tumors.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

In this study, we developed and optimized a neutral red uptake (NRU) assay using human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) as a predictive model (A549-NRU) for acute inhalation toxicity. To improve assay efficiency and robustness, we introduced two key modifications: the incubation time was reduced to 15 minutes to enable rapid and high-throughput screening, and for chemicals reactive with polystyrene 6-well glass plates were used to prevent chemical-induced degradation and ensure assay consistency. LC50 values were determined for 49 chemicals and compared with reported LC50 values from 4-hour rat inhalation studies. A significant positive correlation was observed between A549-NRU-derived LC50 values and in vivo LC50 values for water-soluble compounds and chemicals containing aldehyde, ketone, alcohol, ether, and epoxide functional groups, suggesting that in vivo LC50 values may be predictable using the A549-NRU assay. Additionally, A549-NRU LC50 values showed significant negative correlations with molecular weight and octanol-water partition coefficients, indicating that chemicals with higher values tended to be less cytotoxic in vitro. Importantly, the A549-NRU assay demonstrated stronger correlation with in vivo LC50 values than the conventional NRU assay using mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells. These findings support the use of the A549-NRU assay to estimate starting doses for in vivo studies, and potentially as an in vitro alternative for predicting acute inhalation toxicity.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

However, how these classical pathways integrate into an overall stoichiometrically balanced conversion of sugars to TAGs remains unclear. Previous biochemical and isotope-tracing studies in oilseeds across species have revealed that glycolysis is partially bypassed by alternative routes involving ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) and NADPH-dependent malic enzyme (NADPH-ME). The role of these glycolytic shunts in the overall conversion of carbohydrates to TAG is not fully resolved. Here, we evaluate a minimal stoichiometric model for the carbohydrate-to-TAG conversion that satisfies complete cofactor balancing. Conversion solely through glycolysis and OPPP leads to NADH overproduction and cofactor imbalance. Balanced scenarios require inclusion of the malate shunt, the oxidative RubisCO shunt, or an NADPH-producing glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase variant. All balanced routes also necessitate active mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to convert excess NADH to ATP. Applying a large-scale model of central metabolism in developing Brassica napus seeds, I further predict that glycolytic bypass usage increases in parallel with seed oil content, supporting their role in enabling high lipid biosynthetic fluxes under physiological constraints.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Animal reservoirs getting infections without signs can carry and shed the active spirochete into the environment through their urine, making the control of leptospirosis transmission to humans more challenging. Asymptomatic leptospirosis in human companions, such as dogs and cats, leading to unawareness of infections, has been demonstrated in a few countries. Monitoring disease prevalence and investigating molecular epidemiology is essential for controlling and preventing human and animal leptospirosis transmission. To investigate the prevalence of Leptospira infection among cats and dogs in Thailand, we collected 567 urine samples through a neutering program in seven provinces across the central, western and southern regions. The urine samples were screened for Leptospiras DNA and further speciation using the Sanger Sequencing Analysis. 34/303 (11.2%) dogs and 22/264 (8.3%) cats tested positive for Leptospira in the Pathogen clade. The partial rrs gene analysis identified L. interrogans, L. weilii, and L. borgpetersenii (4.4%). We first reported L. yasudae (1.0%) and other new species of the Pathogen subclade 2 (1.4%) infections among these dogs and cats. Three key pathogenic Leptospira species commonly causing human leptospirosis in Southeast Asia were identified in healthy owned and free-roaming dogs and cats, suggesting the risk of human leptospirosis in the areas. These animal reservoirs (probably living under the same roof as us) can transmit diseases daily to owners (caretakers), other animals and the environment.

Since the introduction of African swine fever (ASF) in the Caucasus in 2007 and its subsequent spread from Eastern to Central Europe, international WB trade increased the risk of ASF introduction into new territories. In order to prevent such events, the EU veterinary authorities decided to ban WB trade in June 2018. In our study, we documented retrospective WB trade movements to France and Spain between 2010 and 2017, and used this data to undertake a quantitative risk assessment for ASF introduction resulting from those shipments. A total of 127 trade events introducing live WB into France (n=93) and Spain (n=34) from Eastern EU countries were recorded between 2010 and 2017, encompassing a total of 5567 animals. Hungary was the main exporter to both countries while Poland was the main exporter to France. The highest annual risk of ASF release was related to shipments from Poland to France after 2014 coinciding with an epidemic phase of ASF in that country. During the same period, the risk of ASFV introduction from Hungary to France was much smaller but gradually increased, coinciding with outbreaks in adjacent Ukraine territory during 2015 onward. Despite no outbreaks in France nor Spain were detected to date, quantified values of ASF introduction risk into Western Europe were very high, suggesting that prohibiting international WB trade in 2018 was well justified. Our study highlights the relevance to monitor and supervise more closely legal wildlife production within the EU countries. Our results are an interesting example on how to use trade data to design and implement risk reduction strategies to reduce the spread of pathogens in the wildlife trade sector.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

The hyporheic invertebrate community composition was entirely dissimilar from the benthic habitat, with stable GB hyporheic location exhibiting a more distinct community composition compared to wetted channel and active GB across all seasons. The local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) also showed that stable GB has significantly higher uniqueness across all seasons, indicating a more unique invertebrate community. Species contribution to beta diversity (SCBD) indicates that this uniqueness was mainly driven by hyporheic dwelling species amphipod, Pseudocrangonyx yezonis, and Isopod species.

Since hippocampal atrophy is a hallmark of several neurological and psychiatric conditions- including depression, PTSD, Alzheimers disease, and aging- understanding the mechanisms by which exercise increases neurogenesis has broad therapeutic relevance. One potential mechanism involves extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipid bilayer-enclosed particles released by multiple tissues during exercise that transport bioactive molecular cargo to distant organs, including the brain. In this study, we tested whether plasma-derived EVs from exercising mice (ExerVs) are sufficient to promote hippocampal neurogenesis, astrogliogenesis, and vascular density in sedentary mice. EVs were isolated from the plasma of sedentary or exercising C57BL/6J mice and injected intraperitoneally into sedentary recipients twice weekly for four weeks. To evaluate reproducibility, the study was conducted across two independent cohorts using identical procedures. ExerV-treated mice showed a significant increase in BrdU-positive cells in the granule cell layer compared to both PBS- and SedV-treated controls in both cohorts. Approximately 90% of these cells co-expressed NeuN, indicating neuronal differentiation, while 6% co-expressed S100B;, indicating astrocyte generation. No changes were observed in vascular density across groups. These findings provide initial evidence that systemically delivered exercise-derived EVs can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis in sedentary mice.

The relative contributions of these two mechanisms to adverse pregnancy outcomes remains poorly understood. In this study, we used spatial transcriptomics to quantify host and viral gene expression at the maternal-fetal interface at near single-cell resolution. Guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection after mid-gestation causes focal infections at the base of the main placenta. Samples for spatial transcriptomics were collected from guinea pigs infected with GPCMV at 35 days gestation. Viral loads and the location of infected cells in placentas were assessed using virus-specific droplet digital PCR and in situ hybridization at 21 days post-infection. Representative placentas were sectioned onto Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slides and sequencing libraries were prepared from six infected and six uninfected tissue sections. Spatial transcriptomes from 33,687 55-{micro}m spots were generated and used in subsequent analyses. To assess how infection affected gene expression at the maternal-fetal interface, a combination of graph-based clustering and manual classification was used to assign spatial transcriptomes to clusters representative of different anatomic regions. Infection dysregulated more transcripts in the decidua and junctional zone than in the labyrinth or non-capillarized syncytium. Notably, infection downregulated transcripts involved in lipid metabolism and upregulated transcripts involved in antiviral defense and chemokine signaling. A second analysis compared the spatial transcriptomes of GPCMV-infected cells and their immediate microenvironment with similar regions in uninfected placentas. A transcriptional signature indicative of immune activation was clear in this comparison, and the local placental response to cytomegalovirus infection was driven by upregulated chemokine signaling. Thus, spatial transcriptomics revealed regional patterns of gene expression in the guinea pig placenta and illuminated how the host response to GPCMV may compromise placental function.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

To overcome these challenges, there is a critical need for a suitable animal model that mimics human disease through the natural route of infection via mites. Here, we report for the first time that a genetically engineered humanized mouse strain (with triple knockout/knock-in of IFN-{gamma} and its receptors), exhibits increased susceptibility to intradermal Ot infection compared to wild-type (WT) mice. This is evidenced by greater body weight loss, elevated bacterial burden, and reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).

SPION labelling efficiency and cytotoxicity was assessed at varying concentrations and incubation times using Prussian blue staining and ATP-based viability assays, respectively. MPI characterization and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) evaluations were performed for cells labelled for two-hour with ProMag or VivoTrax.

However, the climate benefit of the forest sector is influenced by multiple interacting factors, including forest management, climate change, wood-use strategies, and assumptions about substitution benefits, as well as the timing and fate of carbon across the forest ecosystem and technosphere. To evaluate these drivers, we used a coupled forest growth and a wood products model to simulate five different silvicultural strategies under three climate change scenarios, four wood use schemes, and five displacement factor decay pathways over a 285-year period (2015-2300), applied to a Pinus nigra forest in Italy, questioning the impact of these factors on climate mitigation potential of the forest sector. We assessed forest sector balance (FSB, net carbon exchange between forest system and atmosphere), radiative forcing from biogenic CO2 (RFbio), and mitigation efficiency (ME) - the proportion of sequestered carbon contributing to net climate benefit. Results showed that FSB and RFbio were \"broadly\" aligned, but ME varied with the magnitude and duration of biogenic emissions. The scenarios BIOE (bioenergy) and TM (modular cutting) achieved high FSB but showed lower ME due to concentrated or sustained emissions. WOOD and ADAPT yielded higher ME under SSP1-2.6, while several strategies (WOOD, ADAPT, TRANS) became net sources under SSP5-8.5 after 2200. Substitution benefits declined under degressive assumptions, reducing mitigation by up to 53% especially for high-harvest scenarios. FSB was primarily shaped by climate and management, secondly by substitution, however; wood-use strategies had no significant long-term effect provided they did not impact resource availability. Together, these findings underscore that effective forest-sector mitigation requires not only maximizing cumulative carbon stocks, but also minimizing the magnitude, timing, and atmospheric residence time of emissions while carefully considering the role of substitution benefits.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Under favorable conditions, DNA in dental calculus can be preserved for thousands of years and thus presents unique opportunities to study ancient metagenomic material from archaeological remains. Here, we present results from a project aiming to taxonomically characterize the ancient oral metagenome of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) originating from Pleistocene archaeological sites in the Vezere Valley of southern France. This region served as a glacial refugium during the last glacial maximum, but reindeer subsequently became extinct there and are today found only in more northern arctic and boreal regions.

We identified known components of the oral microbiome, and microbes likely originating from the rumen. While putative oral microbiomes differed considerably between ancient and modern samples, we identified six bacterial taxa detected in both ancient and modern samples, all of which are associated with the gastrointestinal tract.

The Pfam database contains a large collection of proteins that are nowadays annotated with domain families through multiple sequence alignments and profile Hidden Markov models (pHMMs). However, such computational annotation methods have some limitations such as problems for handling large datasets and the fact that multiple sequence alignments are computationally challenging to compute with high accuracy due to the increase in complexity as the number of sequences and lengths grow. Additionally, each HMM is independently obtained for each family missing the opportunity of learning patterns across families, that is from a complete view of all the dataset. As an alternative, some deep learning (DL) models have been recently proposed, nevertheless with simple representations of the inputs and moderate improvements in performance. Results: In this work we present ET-Pfam, a novel approach based on transfer learning and ensembles of multiple DL classifiers to predict functional families in the Pfam database. Several base DL models are first trained using learned representations from a protein large language model, with different hyperparameters to increase diversity. Then, the base models are integrated using classical ensemble strategies and novel voting approaches by learning weights for each model and for each Pfam family. Results demonstrate that the proposed ET-Pfam method can consistently diminish classification error rates compared to individual DL models and to pHMM models, boosting prediction performance. Among the strategies presented here, the learned weights by family voting achieved the best performance, with the lowest error rate (7.00%), significantly surpassing the best individual model error (12.91%) and the state-of-the-art pHMM error (29.28%) on the same Pfam dataset.Availability: Data and source code are available at https://github.com/sinc-lab/ET-Pfam.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Results: Our result reveals pronounced differences in defence system repertoires between lineages: while most Acinetobacter spp. harbour a multilayered arsenal, the clinically dominant A. baumannii international clone 2 (IC2) exhibits a depleted but specialised defence landscape, notably enriched in the phosphorothioation-based SspBCDE system and nearly devoid of restriction-modification systems. Strikingly, many defence systems display mutual exclusivity, and defence system is tightly linked to the presence of mobile elements, antibiotics, and heavy metal resistance. Plasmid-borne defence systems, especially BREX, are prevalent, highlighting the role of mobile elements in distributing both immunity and resistance traits. These patterns suggest that successful clinical lineages finely balance immune defences and genetic plasticity, facilitating rapid adaptation under antimicrobial selection and phage threats. Conclusion: These findings provide insights into evolutionary trade-offs underpinning multidrug resistance and have implications for designing targeted phage therapies against recalcitrant Acinetobacter infections.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

However, the precise mechanism of lipid transport by BLTPs has remained elusive. Here, we use extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the precise mechanism of lipid transfer into the BLTP hydrophobic cavity from donor membranes. For multiple BLTPs, we observe the ability to extract and solubilize lipids without lipid selectivity, and we identify membrane destabilization as a critical parameter to achieve effective lipid desorption. We rationally design a mutant BLTP with altered ability to destabilize lipid bilayers, and we show that this abolishes lipid desorption in silico and protein function in vivo. Taken together, our data provide an atomic-level description of the mechanism of lipid transport by BLTPs, ultimately suggesting alternative strategies to interfere with their activity.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

B.; Chen, Y.; Song, X.; Lim, L. H. K.; Wu, J.; Dai, Q.; Holle, A.; Lim, C. T.", "abstract": "Successful metastatic dissemination requires tumor cells to overcome significant physical barriers. When circulating tumor cells (CTCs) become lodged in capillary beds, studies reveal that only a small subset can adapt to fluid shear stress (FSS) within the constricted vasculature. These rare, mechanically resilient cells may subsequently extravasate and form metastatic lesions, but details on this adaptation of the physical environment and its molecular basis are not well understood. Utilizing a microfluidics platform that mimics microcirculatory dynamics, we discover that only breast cancer cells with high metastatic potential maintain directional migration under physiologically relevant FSS conditions. This highlights the mechanical selection process of metastatic precursors during hematogenous dissemination. We identify the TRPM7-Annexin A1-actin signaling pathway as essential for overcoming physical barriers and regulating cell motility under capillary FSS. FSS prompts cytoskeletal reorganization and actin disassembly, restricting cell movement. Cancer cells respond to this by increasing mechanical loading, activating TRPM7 and triggering calcium influx, which then activates Annexin A1. This calcium-dependent protein, Annexin A1, interacts with the actin cortex to prevent FSS-induced actin disassembly, thus aiding migration. Experiments conducted in mouse liver capillaries validate the critical role of this pathway in cancer cell motility. Additionally, we propose a mechano-pharmacological strategy using FTY720 to target the TRPM7 pathway, highlighting its therapeutic potential to modify CTC receptor specificity and inhibit distant metastasis.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Maize canopy architecture, a critical determinant of light capture and photosynthetic efficiency, is influenced by complex interactions between leaf morphology and arrangement. This study aimed to explore the relationships between key leaf morphological traits (midrib shape, blade contour, undulations) and canopy architecture in maize, and to identify optimal leaf morphologies for light interception. We employed correlation analysis and stepwise Bayesian optimization to quantify the relationships between leaf traits and to identify optimal leaf morphologies for maximizing leaf area and minimizing self-shading. Our results revealed that midrib shape and leaf width distribution positively influence leaf area, while undulation has a bidirectional effect depending on its orientation. Optimization results showed that optimal canopies feature upright top leaves, intermediately erect middle leaves, and relatively flat bottom leaves. This study provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting optimal canopy structure in maize, which can inform breeding strategies aimed at improving light utilization and yield potential.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

F.; Holmes, N. M.; Bouton, M. E.; Laurent, V.", "abstract": "While the infralimbic cortex (IL) is recognized as critical for behavioral inhibition, the content of the inhibitory memories stored in this region remains elusive. To probe this content, we examined some of the conditions that allow retrieval and facilitation of an inhibitory memory stored in the IL using optogenetic stimulation in female and male rats. We found that IL stimulation did not facilitate an initial fear extinction session. However, prior experience with fear extinction enabled IL stimulation to facilitate subsequent fear extinction. Importantly, the facilitative effects of IL stimulation were not limited to fear extinction experience, as prior exposure to backward fear conditioning also enabled IL stimulation to enhance later fear extinction. The effects were stimulus-specific and did not depend on the motivational context present during the prior experience, as backward appetitive conditioning allowed IL stimulation to facilitate later fear extinction. Additional experiments ruled out stimulus familiarity as an explanation for the facilitative effects of IL stimulation and demonstrated that IL-mediated facilitations occur in procedures other than fear extinction. Together, these findings demonstrate that the IL stores inhibitory memories that are extremely flexible since they can be retrieved and used across many inhibitory procedures and distinct motivational contexts. These features establish the IL as a critical hub for the flexible application of inhibitory knowledge that allows adaptive responses in dynamic environments.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

The recent surge in congenital infections has raised urgent concerns about the threat of OROV to maternal and fetal health. Here, we establish an in vivo model of OROV vertical transmission using the ancestral (prototype) strain BeAn19991 in immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice. We demonstrate that OROV efficiently replicates in maternal tissues, crosses the maternal-fetal interface, and infects both placental and fetal tissues. Parallel infections in human trophoblast-derived cell lines confirm conserved placental tropism across the ancestral strain and a contemporary (outbreak) isolate from the current outbreak. Importantly, we show that vertical transmission is not a recently acquired trait but a long-standing feature of OROV biology. Offspring born to infected dams mount neutralizing antibody responses and exhibit partial protection upon challenge. These findings conclusively confirm OROV as a vertically transmissible arbovirus, highlighting the urgent need to integrate OROV into surveillance, diagnostic, and vaccine preparedness efforts.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

H.; shi, c.; Su, C.; Zhang, K.", "abstract": "Double-stranded DNA is recognized as a danger signal by cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS), triggering innate immune responses in mammals. As a DNA sensor, cGAS is generally believed to distribute in the cytoplasm, whereas alternative subcellular localization of cGAS, including cytoplasmic membrane and nucleus, is important to regulate its activity. However, it remains obscure whether cGAS could localized to organelle membrane and the mechanism has yet to be uncovered. Our study reveals that cGAS could localize to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and endosomes upon DNA challenge. We identified that the post-translational modification enzymes ZDHHC18 and MARCH8, through their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), facilitate the binding of cGAS to the Golgi and endosome, respectively. These IDRs phase separated to recruit cGAS and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into biomolecular condensates, suppressing cGAS activity and downstream signaling pathways. These findings highlight the regulatory mechanisms of cGAS activity through the spatial organization, providing new insights into the modulation of innate immune responses.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

Population estimates were delineated among 24 Priority Areas for Conservation (PACs) and considered additional sources of information including male-to-female sex ratios, lek attendance rates, numbers of unmodeled leks, and the existence of unsampled/unknown leks. In 2024, the state of Oregon was estimated to contain approximately 41,875 sage-grouse (95% credible interval [CRI] = 38,980-54,634), which was down from a high of 50,869 (95% CRI = 41,794-66,238) in 2017. A nadir (low point) was identified during 2019, when the median statewide population estimate was 30,644 birds. A complete population oscillation was not evident during the inferential period based on local maxima that were observed during the start (2017) and stop (2024) years of analysis. In addition to estimating population sizes, we evaluated N-mixture model estimates for precision and accuracy after randomly removing single and repeat counts in 10% increments (relative to total sample size).

L.; Srouji, J.; Repouliou, A.; Extavour, C. G.", "abstract": "Novel and rapidly evolving genes can integrate into conserved gene networks and play critical roles in development. Understanding how sequence variation across the orthologs of such genes influences functional interactions with the molecular products of older, more conserved genes requires investigation at the level of protein function. Here, we elucidate how protein-coding sequence evolution in oskar, a gene required for primordial germ cell specification and embryonic patterning in fruit flies, has led to functional incompatibility between orthologs from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. We generated chimeric versions of oskar comprising different combinations of Oskar protein domains from each species, expressed these chimeric oskar sequences in D. melanogaster, and quantified their ability to assemble functional germ line and abdominal patterning determinants (germ plasm). We found that a specific portion of D. virilis Oskar, namely the OSK domain, was primarily responsible for the cross-species incompatibility of Oskar. In the absence of endogenous D. melanogaster Oskar, chimeras containing the D. virilis OSK domain could not localize posterior germ plasm well enough to generate primordial germ cells, but were sufficient to specify the anteroposterior axis. We also found that the D. virilis OSK domain had dominant-negative effects on D. melanogaster Oskar's ability to localize germ plasm mRNA, resulting in severe axial patterning defects. We propose that evolved changes in the biophysical properties of the OSK domain between species are linked to distinct molecular interactions with conserved germ plasm molecules. Under this hypothesis, an essential germ line determinant evolved to be incompatible across species of the same genus in less than 50 million years, while retaining functional within-species molecular interactions. This case study illustrates how investigating in vivo protein function can bridge genomic and molecular evolution with phenotypic variation and fitness at higher scales.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}

P.; Perrin, P.; Eudes, N.; Dejean, A.; Magdinier, F.", "abstract": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive and debilitating muscle disease for which no cure currently exists. In the majority of cases, FSHD is associated with the contraction of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array at the 4q35 locus, leading to the inappropriate activation of DUX4, normally expressed during early embryogenesis. In FSHD, the genetic contraction is accompanied by hypomethylation of the D4Z4 array. Although a connection between DNA hypomethylation and DUX4 expression has been suggested, the precise mechanisms that regulate DUX4 transcription remain incompletely defined. The post-translational modification by SUMO was shown previously to repress the expression of Dux, the DUX4 homolog, in mouse embryonic stem cells. Based on these findings, we explored here the contribution of SUMOylation in the regulation of DUX4 in human muscle cells. We demonstrate that TAK-981 (subasumstat), a selective SUMOylation inhibitor, promotes transcriptional reprogramming of the 4q35 locus and induces DUX4 expression. Importantly, this activation occurs independently of changes in DNA methylation or SMCHD1 ATPase activity. Our findings identify SUMOylation inhibition as a novel regulatory pathway driving DUX4 expression. This work uncovers the importance of SUMOylation in the epigenetic control of the 4q35 locus and DUX4 transcription, providing a potential therapeutic strategy to modulate DUX4 expression in FSHD.", "date": "2025-08-02", "journal": ""}
