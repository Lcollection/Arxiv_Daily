Impaired GABAergic signaling is thought to underlie cortical hyperexcitability in autism. Here we show that dysregulation of astrocyte GABA transport in Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading genetic cause of autism, contributes to circuit hyperexcitability. Human FXS astrocytes derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and mouse Fmr1 knockout (KO) astrocytes display a significant increase in levels of GABA and GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD65/67. Our astrocyte-specific Fmr1 KO (cKO) mouse model reveals reduced inhibitory connectivity and impaired cortical responses to sound. Reverse GABA transport in cortical astrocytes contributes to impaired fidelity of temporal processing and hyperactive behaviors in cKO mice. Blocking astrocyte GABA transport is sufficient to restore PV expression, cortical activity, EEG responses, and locomotor behavior. Our findings suggest astrocyte GABA transport plays a key role in regulating cortical inhibition, and contributes to autism-associated phenotypes.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that CLB2 mRNA localizes to the bud via the She2/She3 complex, while Clb2 protein accumulates in the mother nucleus. This mRNA localization enhances translation without affecting protein localization. A structured RNA element, a ZIP-code, is located within the coding sequence and is required, but not sufficient, for both mRNA transport and protein expression. Mutation of this ZIP code disrupts mRNA localization, reduces Clb2 synthesis, increases budded phase duration and daughter cell size. In wild-type cells, Clb2 protein levels scale with bud growth, a coupling lost in ZIP code mutants. These findings reveal a mechanism by which mRNA localization and translation are coordinated to link cell growth with cell cycle progression.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Reduced mechanosensory behavior was observed with ePL synthesizing gene knockout or knockdown in mechano-sensitive PIEZO-expressing neurons. The activation of PIEZO channels was significantly augmented in the presence of ePLs.

Despite fruits being one of the most widely consumed plant parts, the spatial distribution of metals and their possible physiological impact remained largely unexplored. In this study, we searched for conserved metal accumulation sites in fruits of various crops and investigated their physiological function. By using X-ray and histochemical-based techniques, we found that calcium accumulated in the outermost hardened tissues, potassium in fleshy tissues, and iron (Fe) in vascular tissues. Furthermore, seeds accumulated Fe in the fruit-seed juncture, which remained in the chalazal part of the seed upon dispersal. In Arabidopsis thaliana, seed chalazal Fe formed a distinct circular shape, which appeared diffuse in metal tolerance protein 8 mutants. Seed chalazal Fe appeared also in tomato seeds, albeit more diffused and at higher concentrations. In tomato, treatment with the Fe immobilizer desferoxamine delayed germination in wild-type plants but not in mutants with low chalazal Fe, indicating that chalazal Fe may contribute to germination. This study marks the first systematic application of X-ray fluorescence and histochemistry to investigate conserved metal localization sites in mature fleshy fruits.

However, most of this sequence data is unassembled, or where assembled was done so with no consistent assembler or quality control. Although this data has great potential, these inconsistencies make it unsuitable for large-scale analyses, and inaccessible for most researchers to reuse. Therefore in our previous effort, we released a uniformly assembled set of 661,405 genomes, consisting of all publicly available whole genome sequenced bacterial isolate data up to a cutoff of November 2018, enriched with various search indexes to make the data easier to sort and use. In this study, we first extend the dataset up to August 2024 with the same consistent assembly pipeline, more than tripling the number of genomes available. We also expand the scope of the dataset beyond genomes, as we begin a global collaborative project to generate annotations, species-specific analyses, evolutionary data, new search indices, and protein structural data. Our collaboration is therefore grass-roots, driven by the needs of different research communities within microbiology. In this paper, we describe the project as of release 2024-08, comprising 2,440,377 assemblies. All 2.4 million genomes have been uniformly reprocessed for quality criteria and to give taxonomic abundance estimates with respect to the GTDB phylogeny. We further enrich the dataset with sequence annotations from Bakta, antimicrobial resistance predictions from AMRFinderPlus, and AlphaFold2 protein structure predictions for the 17.7M hypothetical proteins. By applying an evolution-informed compression approach, the full set of genomes is just 130Gb: a reduction of about 23x compared to compressing individual assemblies. To make the resource as accessible as possible, we also provide multiple search indexes, a method for alignment to the full dataset, and cloud-based access to all the genomes.

We aimed to test this hypothesis using 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging in 29 healthy young adults. We first considered time-of-year changes in activity that are related to the slow change in photoperiod. We find that the response to emotional stimuli of selected medial and superior nuclei of the amygdala peaked around the start of winter or increased with worse mood status. We further assessed how alternating short exposures to light of different illuminance acutely affected the regional activity of the amygdala. We show that the same areas showed a linear reduction of activity when exposed to increasing light illuminance, specifically when processing emotional stimuli. Importantly, the impact of light on part of these nuclei peaked around the start of summer or decreased with worse mood. These findings provide new evidence that humans show seasonality and that, for mood, it involves parts of the amygdala.

Individuals with DESSH syndrome exhibit a recognizable craniofacial gestalt, developmental delay/intellectual disability, neurobehavioral symptoms that include autism, ADHD, behavioral difficulties and seizures. However, no thorough studies from a vertebrate model exist to understand how these changes occur. To overcome this, we developed both murine and zebrafish Wac/wac deletion mutants and studied whether their phenotypes recapitulate those described in individuals with DESSH syndrome.

Using computational modeling, we showed that this center-surround inhibition could be reproduced by either a sharpening of tuning curves of expected orientation or a shift of tuning curves of unexpected orientations. Intriguingly, these two computations were further supported by orientation-adjustment and orientation-discrimination experiments. Finally, the ablation studies in convolutional neural networks revealed that predictive coding feedback played a critical role in the center-surround inhibition in expectation.

The bacteria is known to establish direct physical contact with the host compartment prior to phagosome disruption.

To probe this, we first developed a method wherein we reconstitute a phagosome-like giant compartment encapsulating Mycobacterium smegmatis, a non-motile opportunistic bacterium. We discover that the direct contact between the bacteria and the encapsulating host membrane induces membrane bending, lipid wrapping, and local lipid phase separation at the contact site. The degree of phase separation is driven by the bacterial load leading to fluidization of the membrane, as evident from the decreased area stretch and bending modulus, making the host compartment more deformable. Surprisingly, for saturating bacterial load the fluid host membrane transforms into a scaffold-like rigid layer. We also find that the direct contact of the bacteria enhances the membranolytic potential of ESAT-6 thus contributing to its virulence. Together our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of direct physical contact of the bacteria during phagosome disruption.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

But bimolecular reaction kinetics are difficult to experimentally measure on 2-dimensional membranes and are usually measured in volumetric in vitro assays. Membrane tethering produces confinement and steric effects that will significantly impact binding rates in ways that are not readily estimated from volumetric measurements. Also, there are situations when 2D reactions do not conform to simple mass action kinetics. Here we show how highly coarse-grained molecular simulations using the SpringSaLaD software can be used to estimate membrane-tethered rate constants from experimentally determined volumetric kinetics. The approach is validated using an analytical solution for dimerization of binding sites anchored via stiff linkers. This approach can provide 2-dimensional bimolecular rate constants to parameterize cell-scale models of receptor-mediated signaling. We explore how factors such as molecular reach, steric effects, disordered domains, local concentration and diffusion affect the kinetics of binding. We also develop a general scheme to assess whether simple mass action rate constants can be applied for a given scenario, taking into account the diffusivity of the membrane anchors and tethered binding sites, the initial membrane densities of the reactants and the desired level of completion for the fitted rate constant. We then apply our approach to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediated activation of the membrane-bound small GTPase Ras. The analysis reveals how binding of Ras to the allosteric site of SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is recruited to EGFR, significantly accelerates Ras binding to the SOS catalytic site.

LTCC clustering and LTCC-dependent CREB phosphorylation are selectively disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol, implicating biomolecular condensation. Activated CaMKII holoenzymes assemble complexes containing multiple CaV1.2 and/or CaV1.3 1 subunits.

In HEK293 cells, pharmacological LTCC activation enhances clustering only when wild-type CaMKII is co-expressed. A CaMKII mutant that cannot bind LTCC N-terminal domains fails to support LTCC subunit complex formation in vitro and LTCC clustering in HEK293 cells. In neurons, the knockdown of CaMKII expression disrupts depolarization-induced (co-)clustering of CaV1.2 and CaV1.3.

Despite the interconvertibility of CCS and spherical coordinate systems (SCS, {rho}, {theta} and {phi}), CCS remains to date the default and the only framework for protein structure description in PDB. Recent advances in protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold) revolutionized the field by integrating deep learning algorithms with experimental structural data, achieving unprecedented accuracy of protein structure prediction and relying on Cartesian representation of protein structures to extract geometric features. To this end, questions remain about what drives the next stage of continued performance improvement of protein structure prediction. Therefore, this article introduces an alternative coordinate system for protein structure description and feature extraction. Using Caenopore-5 as an example, this article redefines protein backbone structures using atomic bonding networks (ABN) within the SCS framework (ABN-SCS), leading to the extraction of a set of spherical parameters ({rho}, {theta} and {phi}) from the NMR ensemble of Caenopore-5, encompassing 477 covalent bonds and 80 peptide bonds within its backbone for each structural model in its NMR ensemble. Finally, this work demonstrates that ABN-SCS enables characterization of spherical bond-level geometries, expanding the feature space available for computational pipelines such as AlphaFold2, and argues that integrating ABN-SCS features into protein structure prediction pipelines can enhance geometric fidelity, and that the time is now ripe for the trapped spherical features [{rho}, {theta}, {phi}] to be integrated into algorithms such as AF2 towards protein structure prediction with improved performance.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Diversification into four endemic Lates species occurred within the lake during a time of dramatic changes in lake levels driven by glacial-interglacial cycles, supporting the hypothesis that these fluctuations were a \"species pump\" for lacustrine taxa.

Extensive genomic and experimental studies suggest that adaptation during the saprophytic, off-host phase, rather than adaptation to hosts, primarily constrains the biogeographic distribution of these microbes. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the growth capacities and genomic features of 38 Sinorhizobium strains nodulating Medicago lupulina (black medic), collected from two regions with distinct thermal environments. The warmer region is predominantly inhabited by S. meliloti, while S. medicae and non-symbiotic strains (lacking symbiosis genes, such as S. canadensis and S. adherens) are more common in the cooler region. Laboratory assays demonstrated that at 40C, the upper temperature limit of their region of origin, S. meliloti remained viable, albeit with reduced growth, whereas S. medicae and non-symbiotic strains failed to grow under heat stress. Comparative genomics revealed isolation-by-distance in both the core and accessory genomes, particularly in S. meliloti in the warmer region, which exhibits less within-region thermal variation. This is consistent with an isolation-by-distance model where population divergence is governed by restricted gene flow. These findings suggest that metabolic constraints shape the regional distribution of this facultative microbial symbiont, while limited gene flow influences local population structure.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Their stability plays a very important role in the prevention of DNA degradation, leading to the promotion or inhibition of specific biological pathways upon formation. In this work, we explore the occurrences of intermediates originating from the unfolding of these structures by using all-atom simulations, analyzing a small number of significant reaction coordinates to follow the evolution of the system by applying a mesoscopic simplification of the structures followed by two different dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and time-Independent Component Analysis (tICA). The data of the reduced trajectories are then encoded into a Complex Markov Network which, in conjunction with an Stochastic Steepest Descent, provides a hierarchical organization of the different nodes into basins of attraction.

Here we present Superb-seq, a new technology that leverages T7 in situ transcription and single-cell RNA sequencing to jointly measure on- and off-target Cas9 edits and their effects on gene expression. We performed Superb-seq on 10,000 K562 cells, targeting four chromatin remodeler genes with seven guide RNAs. Superb-seq identified 11,891 edit events in 6,230 edited cells at all seven on-target sites and at an additional 36 off-target sites. Although the seven guides were selected for high specificity, six of them caused off-target edits, ranging in frequency from 0.03% to 18.6% of cells. A notable off-target edit within the first intron of USP9X disrupted the expression of this gene and over 150 downstream genes. In summary, Cas9 off-targeting is pervasive due to a combination of rare and common edit events, occurs primarily within introns of off-target genes, and can exert widespread effects on gene expression. Superb-seq uses off-the-shelf kits, standard equipment, and requires no virus, which will enable genome-wide CRISPR screens in diverse cell types as well as functional characterization of clinically-relevant guides.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Background: The dynamics of vector borne disease transmission depend on the abundancesof vectors. The dominant malaria vector species complex of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato is a target of vector control strategies designed to reduce and eliminate malaria transmission. The three most widely distributed dominant malaria vectors within the species complex are An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae sensu stricto. Methods: Previous studies across the extent of the species complex range have been restricted to annual predictions of species occurrence or relative abundance. This study incorporated relative abundance data at the species level and abundance data at the species complex level to estimate and predict daily equilibrium vector abundances of each species. Statistical models with interpretable parameters were used to gain insight into how factors such as meteorological conditions, insecticide treated net use, and human density affect the spatial and temporal predictions. The statistical models were used to predict daily equilibrium vector abundance that is an important factor in indices of malaria transmission such as the basic reproduction number and vectorial capacity. Results: Meteorological factors, such as precipitation and relative humidity, and human factors, such as population density and insecticide treated nets, were important predictors of these three malaria vector species in Africa. Insecticide treated net use was negatively associated with per capita vector abundance of the An. gambiae species complex and interacted with year to suggest an a negative effect on the ratio of An. gambiae s.s. to An. arabiensis at the end of the prediction period that extended from 2002 to 2020. A predicted increasing interannual trend for An. coluzzii was potentially caused by changing species identification methods. Conclusion: The predicted equilibrium abundances of the three species showed potentially high levels of geographical overlap, niche overlap, and evidence for stable coexistence despite substantial interspecific competition. Improving collection of longitudinal species abundance data across the spatial range of the An. gambiae species complex will facilitate future explorations of causal hypotheses that relate vector abundance to control measures, malaria interventions and meteorological conditions.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

The gene in Saccharolobus islandicus REY15A, named as Cran1 (Cell cycle related ATPase and nickase 1), cannot be deleted and exhibits cyclic expression patterns, with a peak expression during the transition from M-G1 to S cell cycle phase. Cran1 overexpression leads to significant growth retardation, cell size enlargement, and increased cellular DNA content. Cran1 displays potent nickase and ATPase activities in vitro, with the nickase activity being dependent on the presence of the ATPase domain. Notably, Cran1 copurifies with chromatin-associated proteins, such as Cren7 and a histone deacetylase homolog, suggesting its involvement in chromatin-related activities.

Indeed, through techniques such as the memory palace, which translate numerical information into more natural contexts, memory athletes manage considerably higher rates. This suggests that memory, in its intended environment and under training, performs at substantial speed, which can be quantified in memory competitions. Analyzing the data reveals three phenomena. First, in short-duration tasks up to 42 bit/s have been achieved. Remarkably, competitors spend most of the time on reading, indicating that they form mental associations even more rapidly. Second, record performances show a remarkable concordance across time scales: the processing speed depends on memorization time as a power law.

DTU analysis requires the quantification of individual isoforms from RNA-seq data, which has a high level of uncertainty due to transcript overlap and read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA). Popular DTU analysis methods do not directly account for the RTA overdispersion within their statistical frameworks, leading to reduced statistical power or poor error rate control, particularly in scenarios with small sample sizes. This article presents limma and edgeR analysis pipelines that account for RTA during DTU assessment. Leveraging recent advancements in the limma and edgeR Bioconductor packages, we propose DTU analysis pipelines optimized for small and large datasets with a unified interface via the diffSplice function. The pipelines make use of divided counts to remove RTA-induced dispersion from transcript isoform counts and account for the sparsity in transcript-level counts. Simulations and analysis of real data from mouse mammary epithelial cells demonstrate that the diffSplice pipelines provide greater power, improved efficiency, and improved FDR control compared to existing specialized DTU methods.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

G.; Weaver, A. L.", "abstract": "Currently, the causes for Alzheimer Disease (AD) are thought to lie in the formation of abnormal protein deposits including tau tangles and Amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) plaques in the human cortex. These proteins are believed to accumulate in the brain due to impaired waste removal resulting in neurodegeneration. In an alternative hypothesis we have recently proposed the existence of an aquaporin-4 aqua channel (AQP4)-expressing tanycyte-derived canal network that likely internalizes waste for removal from the brain. We propose that both A{beta} and tau protein may play important structural roles in this canal system. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate the formation of waste-internalizing receptacles by AQP4-expressing myelinated tanycytes. Using RNA-scope in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural, and histological approaches, we demonstrate receptacle differentiation in tanycyte-derived 'swell-bodies.' We show that these receptacles are AQP4- and A{beta}-immunoreactive and that related gene expression is observed in 'swell-bodies' where receptacle differentiation is observed. Through correlative light- and electron-microscopy in human and mouse brain, we demonstrate that both A{beta} and tau protein are associated with these waste-internalizing structures (Agre et al., 2002) and likely play important roles in the waste internalization process. Based on our findings, we postulate that the functional significance of A{beta} may be structural stabilization of waste-internalizing structures and canals to prevent their collapse during the uptake process. We propose that tau protein may govern the quantitatively appropriate release of waste-internalizing structures. We postulate that AD-related A{beta}-plaques and tau tangles likely show hypertrophic pathologies of this glial-canal-system and associated waste-internalizing receptacles.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Inharmonic sounds with a constant jittering pattern generated similar MMN and stronger P3a responses than harmonic sounds. In contrast, MMN responses became undetectable when the jittering pattern changed between consecutive sounds, suggesting that prediction errors are weighted by sequential but not spectral uncertainty. Interestingly, inharmonic sounds generated an object-related negativity, a response associated with the segregation of auditory objects. Our results suggest that inharmonicity induces the segregation of the auditory scene into different streams, captures attention, and gives rise to specific neural processes that are independent from the predictive mechanisms underlying sequential deviance detection.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

We combine 16S rRNA amplicon analysis of the giant kelp microbiome with carbohydrate monomer analysis of kelp exudates to examine microbe-exudate relationships. We found significant differences in the microbiome and exudate composition between seasons and developmental stages of giant kelp. Higher tissue-nitrogen content in the spring coincided with elevated amounts of glucosamine, a nitrogen-containing sugar, in giant kelp exudates, while senescence led to the release of mannuronic acid, an alginate indicator. The release of glucosamine and fucose-rich exudates was correlated with an increase in the abundance of bacteria within the Planctomycetota phylum, whereas mannuronic acid-rich exudates coincided with an increase in the abundance of members of the Flavobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria lineages. We investigated putative carbohydrate-microbe relationships by isolating a member of the Planctomycetota phylum from the surface of giant kelp. We demonstrate that the growth of this isolate on fucoidan and N-acetyl glucosamine, but not alginate reflects the observed abundance of this clade in the kelp microbiome in response to variable carbohydrate exudation.

Different types of NM neurons display various synapse density and number on dendrites, with the number being positively correlated with their total projection length. By reconstructing presynaptic neurons (PNs) and identifying their E/I identity, in-depth analysis of individual locus coeruleus (LC)-NE neurons revealed that they receive brain-wide synaptic inputs, which are organized into modality- and E/I-dependent spatial patterns along dendrites. Moreover, a subset of PNs innervate multiple LC-NE neurons, and this input sharing extends across NE, DA, and 5HT systems, suggesting a co-innervation mechanism for coordinated modulation within and across diverse NM systems.

Oscillatory brain activity, measurable via Electroencephalography (EEG), serves as a biomarker for functional circuits and treatment response. To better understand the impact of rTMS on brain oscillations and connectivity, we used computational modeling of corticothalamic circuits to explore the mechanisms of stimulus-induced plasticity.

It is the building block of capsids that protect the genome of viruses in the Duplodnaviria realm, infecting organisms across all domains of life. It is also the building block of encapsulins, compartments that confine biochemical reactions in prokaryotes. Recent genomic studies have hypothesized that encapsulins evolved from HK97-fold viruses. However, this evolutionary pathway is challenging to justify biophysically because HK97-fold viruses form larger and more complex protein shells than encapsulins. We addressed this paradox by searching for smaller and simpler HK97-fold viral capsids across ecosystems. The investigation yielded a well-defined group of viral entities, which encode HK97-fold proteins displaying molecular similarities with encapsulins and lacking portal and tail genes. The structural phylogenetic analysis of HK97-fold entities revealed bidirectional evolutionary transitions between encapsulins and HK97-fold viruses. An evolutionary mechanism responsible for such transitions was proposed based on the presence of lysogeny-associated genes in the viral entities and the structural and molecular parallels between encapsulins and procapsids, the immature state of viral capsids before genome packaging. We concluded that procapsids are akin to the common HK97-fold protein shell ancestor and might still facilitate transitions between modern viruses and encapsulins. The potential genomic and biochemical functions of HK97-fold procapsids make them an ideal candidate model for the early evolution of life and might require a revision of the role of viral capsids in the biosphere.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

It remains unclear whether variations in CGA levels influence the TMA-lowering activity of different cultivars. We investigated the impact of blueberry CGA content on inhibition of choline-d9 conversion to TMA-d9 in our upper gastrointestinal and in vitro human fecal model. Preliminary experiments indicated near-total inhibition of TMA-d9 production when whole blueberries were tested. Blueberry pulp and sugars recapitulated this complete inhibition, whereas blueberry skins and a fiber had more moderate inhibition. We proceeded with skins (to avoid interferences from sugar-rich pulp, which would not be present in the colon in vivo) from 20 highbush blueberry genotypes, chosen for extremes in CGA content. CGA in whole berries was 2.6-146 mg/100 g fresh weight, while CGA in skins was 13.6-975 mg/100 g fresh weight. No differences were observed in TMA-d9 production among the 4 highest and 4 lowest CGA genotypes in kinetic curves or area under the curve (AUC) values when skin digesta were fermented with choline-d9. However, significant differences were observed between all genotypes compared to blank digesta, with ~19.4.% reduction in TMA-d9 AUCs, indicating that skins provides similar TMA-lowering benefits across genotypes. Levels of free CGA in fermenta of skin digesta were 0.05-0.3 , >1000-fold lower than the minimum effective dose we observed for pure CGA in vitro, suggesting that blueberry CGA content is not a crucial factor for lowering TMA. Fiber also does not account for most of the inhibitory activity of blueberry skins. Studies are needed to confirm this in vitro study and understand how blueberries inhibit TMA and potentially TMAO production in vivo.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Its impermeable eggshell has restricted the use of small-molecule interventions during embryogenesis. Existing genetic approaches for rendering the embryo permeable to acute small molecule treatment have increased the accessibility of early embryogenesis of pharmacological manipulation but compromise long-term viability for use in studies of later developmental processes or post-exposure physiology. Here, we describe the use of an optimized enzymatic eggshell digestion protocol coupled with a minimal, serum-free culture media that supports the survival and normal development of ex ovo embryos through larval maturation and adulthood. We show that this approach renders embryos permeable to a wide range of small molecules, enabling precise temporal manipulation of developmental processes previously inaccessible through conventional genetic or physical methods. We demonstrate the utility of this technique through the application of small molecule fluorescent dyes, the pharmacological modulation of key cytoskeletal components including microtubules and actin, as well as the minus-end-directed microtubule motor protein dynein, highlighting applications for study of cell division, morphogenesis, and neuronal cell biology, especially in later stages of embryogenesis.

Coadaptation within the 'Molassodon' ecospecies of Vibrio parahaemolyticus is concentrated in 48 core genes and over 100 accessory genes on an otherwise undifferentiated genetic background. Using this list of adaptive differences as a foundation for laboratory experiments, we find that the ecological strategy of the ecospecies is to hunt, kill and devour bacterial prey in viscous liquids. Instead of swarming on surfaces, Molassodon strains have differentiated and repurposed their lateral flagella to enhance swimming. We functionally link Type VI secretion and nutrient uptake to this motility phenotype and reconstruct the evolution of Molassodon, showing that several key genes have been imported from other Vibrio species.

Previously, we reported that natural variation in heat tolerance is life-stage specific in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that thermal selection predominantly targets the early embryonic life stage. Here, we used advanced introgression and pooled whole-genome resequencing to map the genomic basis of enhanced embryonic heat tolerance in a neotropical line of D. melanogaster. We identified two loci on chromosomes 2R and X that were consistently targeted by 16 generations of thermal selection across six replicate introgressions. We compared alleles in these regions to published datasets of natural variation from North America and Europe using the DEST dataset. This analysis revealed that two SNPs associated with embryonic heat tolerance exhibited both clinal and seasonal patterns, with the seasonal variation significantly correlated with environmental variability in average precipitation and temperature variance across space and time. Further, tropical alleles at both loci exhibited enhanced embryonic heat tolerance in the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP), demonstrating the genotype-to-phenotype link in an independent set of diverse genetic backgrounds. The two SNPs lie in the putative regulatory regions of the genes SP70 and sog, where allelic differences in gene expression correlate with the heat tolerance phenotype. Overall, our results suggest that regulatory loci that influence embryonic heat tolerance are under selection in nature.

However, prior demonstrations typically compared trial unique meaningful objects with a small set of repeated simple features. This design confounds meaningfulness with proactive interference (PI), such that PI is minimal for trial-unique objects but substantial for repeated features. As a result, superior performance for meaningful objects may reflect contributions from episodic long-term memory (LTM) rather than expanded WM capacity. To test this, Experiment 1 measured WM for repeated colors, repeated meaningful objects, and trial-unique meaningful objects. The advantage for objects over colors was replicated in the trial-unique condition, but eliminated for repeated objects that equated PI across stimulus types. Hierarchical Bayesian dual-process modeling revealed that the trial-unique advantage reflected stronger familiarity signals, whereas recollection remained stable across stimulus types. Experiment 2 assessed WM storage directly using contralateral delay activity (CDA), an electrophysiological marker of the number of items stored. Although trial-unique objects again yielded behavioral advantages, CDA activity across increasing set sizes revealed a common slope and plateau for trial-unique meaningful objects and repeated colors. The CDA difference between stimulus types was additive and did not vary with set size, providing no evidence for an increased number of stored items. These findings demonstrate that previously reported advantages for meaningful objects primarily reflect reduced PI and enhanced LTM familiarity. When PI is equated, WM storage limits for simple and meaningful stimuli are equivalent.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Despite the remarkable diversity and abundance of Lepidoptera globally, there is a lack of information on how moth species are impacted by urbanization. Notably, very little is known about moths in the largest city of the United States, New York City, where pervasive urban pollutants, artificial light at night, land cover change, and habitat fragmentation are severe. We examined the effects of urbanization on moth biodiversity in New York City, with a focus on green spaces. We used citizen science records from iNaturalist and complemented these data with ground sampling at twelve locations across six parks at night. While the iNaturalist dataset is comprehensive both spatially and temporally, it failed to detect rarer species we observed on the ground. However, the scope of the field survey dataset is limited in geographical breadth and seasonal coverage. Overall, we found a negative relationship between greater urbanization and moth diversity, with community similarity correlated with environmental similarity. Our results found greater biodiversity with less light at night and urban development, and more deciduous tree cover and open land. Our structural equation model reveals additional insight: although we detected a strong direct negative effect of developed land on moth diversity, urbanization also negatively impacts diversity via indirect effects of reducing open space and deciduous tree cover. Developed open space alone does not directly affect diversity but may positively impact diversity through its covariance with vegetation cover. These findings support the importance of mitigating artificial light at night in urban green spaces and maintaining urban vegetation to ensure nocturnal Lepidoptera can persist in rapidly urbanizing landscapes.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

We also considered an alternate hypothesis: cationic electrostatic interactions between histones and negatively charged phospholipids, deforming endothelial cell membranes and thereby allowing extracellular Ca2+ entry. A role for SOCE in histone responses was ruled out by genetic ablation of the ORAI1/2/3 channel trio; histone effects were blocked by application of the multivalent cation gadolinium Gd3+. Using live cell video microscopy of endothelial cell labeled with membrane dye FM1-43, we recorded fast plasma membrane movements including vesiculation, blebbing, and ruffling of lamellipodia over 60 minutes following histone exposure. These cell membrane theatrics were markedly different from the uniform pattern of rapid exocytosis and subsequent blebbing produced by calcium overload with ionomycin. The membrane permeabilization produced by histones, and not ionomycin, was transient and a subset of cells recovered membrane integrity within 1 hour. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ prevented histone-induced intracellular Ca2+ overload while surprisingly exacerbating plasma membrane deformation. Conversely, decreasing the density of the negative charge surface by adding calcium or or increasing extracellular Ca2+ levels effectively screened common membrane phospholipids from interactions with labeled histones and prevented endothelial damage in cells exposed to histones. Collectively these results indicate that low extracellular Ca2+ levels enhance interactions between histones and endothelial cell membrane phospholipids to increase cytotoxicity. Importantly, this supports the concept of aggressive Ca2+ repletion during resuscitation to prevent hypocalcemia, stabilize endothelial cell membranes and improve cardiovascular recovery from shock.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined how infestation by the oligophagous aphid Brachycaudus lychnidis affects sex-specific interactions among the dioecious plant Silene latifolia and its specialist moth pollinator Hadena bicruris. We exposed male and female plants to aphid herbivory and evaluated its effects on floral traits (visual cues, floral scent, and nectar chemistry) and pollinator behaviour. Contrary to sexual selection theory, female plants were not less attractive than males under control conditions. Instead, our results suggest that females exhibit plasticity in floral trait expression depending on pollination success. Aphid infestation altered floral traits in a sex-specific way, with stronger declines in female attractiveness linked to nectar compounds potentially acting as feeding cues or behavioural modulators.

Genetics studies have discovered many dozens of genes with causal roles in autism, and functional analyses have demonstrated that ASD-associated mutations affect a diverse range of brain regions and cell types. However, the precise mechanisms by which these genetic alterations lead to autism-related phenotypes remain unclear. Psychiatric cognitive and behavioral traits are believed to arise from dysfunction of specific brain circuits formed by anatomically and functionally connected brain areas. To identify the circuits and cell types primarily affected by ASD mutations, we developed an unbiased approach, GENCIC, which computationally integrates genome-wide genetic data with a brain-wide spatial mouse transcriptome and an anatomical mesoscale connectome. Applying this approach to ASD reveals a convergence of mutations on cohesive brain circuits that are enriched in long-distance connections and span both cortical and subcortical brain structures. Furthermore, our analysis of brain-wide single-cell spatial transcriptomics shows that the heterogeneity of circuit structures affected in ASD is matched by the substantial diversity of strongly impacted circuit cell types. Notably, the implicated circuits and cell types play a central role in the integration of multimodal sensory and emotional information and in decision-making based on this information. We also find that different circuit structures exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns that correlate with cognitive phenotypes in ASD. Overall, our study demonstrates how ASD-related genetic mutations impact multiple levels of brain organization, ultimately disrupting functional circuits that drive core autism-related behaviors.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

One approach to increase model complexity while remaining computationally tractable in the context of birth-death modelling is machine learning. So far, these techniques have been explored in the context of serially-sampled phylogenies (phylodynamics) and trait-dependent birth-death models. Here, we explore the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning (DL) method, to solve classification and regression (parameter estimation) tasks under time-varying birth-death models. In particular, we compared six diversification scenarios: Constant Birth-Death, High-Extinction, Mass-Extinction, Diversity-Dependent, Stasis-and-Radiate, and Waxing-and-Waning. We simulated 10,000 phylogenetic trees under each diversification scenario, which were encoded using a vectorization procedure that captures the topology and branch length information. The encoded trees were used to train or test a set of CNNs models that were designed to tailor three empirical case studies differing in the number of tips. We compared CNNs performance with MLE inference. Our results show that CNNs exhibited classification accuracy levels of 93-78%, whereas maximum likelihood estimation achieved levels of 74-70%, using AIC as model selection criterion. The most difficult scenarios to predict for the CNNs were the high-extinction and mass-extinction scenarios, which were often misidentified as one another. For the regression tasks, mean average errors were comparable between CNNs models and MLE inference, and they also coincided in their difficulties to estimate ratio parameters such as mass extinction survival and turnover.

J.; Azouz, G.; Beier, K.; Lur, G.", "abstract": "Repeated exposure to stress disrupts cognitive processes, including attention and working memory. A key mechanism supporting these functions is the ability of neurons to sustain action potential firing, even after a stimulus is no longer present. How stress impacts this persistent neuronal activity is currently unknown. We found that repeated exposure to multiple concurrent stressors during adolescence (aRMS) impedes the ability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5 PNs) in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to produce persistent firing. To determine the mechanisms underlying this effect, we complemented computational modelling with whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices from male mice. Our model predicted that altered intrinsic excitability, reduced local connectivity, diminished glutamatergic transmission, or enhanced inhibition could explain diminished persistent activity. In ex vivo experiments, we found minimal effect of aRMS on excitability and recurrent connectivity. However, stress exposure altered the properties of excitatory connections between L5 PNs, specifically affecting decay kinetics and short-term synaptic dynamics. In addition, aRMS increased inhibitory tone in the PPC, altering both GABAa and GABAb receptor-mediated responses. Incorporating the observed physiological changes into our network model, we found that no single parameter was sufficient alone to reproduce the stress-induced reduction in persistent firing. Rather, a combination of altered excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission was necessary to impact sustained activity. These data suggest that a multitude of converging changes in neural and circuit function underpin the effects of stress on cognitive processes.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

An imbalance in cholesterol levels may affect synaptic plasticity and contribute to neurodegeneration. Here, we identify in human dopaminergic neurons a mechanism linking loss of function of the Parkinson's disease (PD) gene PINK1 to altered cholesterol homeostasis. Loss of functional PINK1 impaired SCAP phosphorylation at Ser822 and Ser838, stabilizing SCAP and driving excess cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol accumulated at the plasma membrane and in flotillin-rich lipid rafts, causing reduced neurotransmitter uptake and altering the distribution of dopamine transporter (DAT). Restoring PINK1 expression normalized cholesterol biosynthesis and levels. Moreover, the cholesterol-lowering drugs simvastatin and {beta}-cyclodextrin rescued DAT distribution and neurotransmitter uptake defects. These findings demonstrate that PINK1 influences cholesterol homeostasis through SCAP phosphorylation at Ser822 and Ser838 and that restoring cholesterol levels mitigates phenotypes observed in PINK1 PD neurons. These findings further highlight the cross-talk between mitochondria and lipid homeostasis in PD models, underscoring the relevance of cholesterol levels to dopaminergic functions.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Viral discovery in soils has been further limited by technical hurdles, particularly obtaining sufficient yields of high quality RNA for sequencing. To address this, we evaluated a range of storage and preservation strategies, including the use of commercial preservative solutions and ultra-cold snap-freezing, followed by standardised RNA extraction, sequencing, and virus discovery pipelines. This work aimed to establish minimum sample storage requirements that maintain RNA integrity, generate sufficient RNA sequencing data, and subsequently enable reliable soil virome characterisation. While no preservative solution proved effective, neat soil samples were stable at 2-8{degrees}C and -30{degrees}C for at least two weeks, and at -80{degrees}C for at least three months, with no measurable reduction in RNA quality, sequencing data, or viral abundance and diversity. From 32 resulting sequencing libraries, we identified 1,475 putative novel RNA viruses, with the majority belonging to the microbe-associated phylum Lenarviricota. Several novel viruses formed divergent clusters with other environmentally derived sequences distantly related to traditionally animal-associated families such as the Astroviridae and Picornaviridae. Furthermore, unique clusters within the Picobirnaviridae, Alsuvurucetes, Ghabrivirales, and Amabiliviricetes comprised exclusively Australian viruses, suggesting instances of region-specific evolution.

However, the molecular mechanisms that couple GPCR activation to these adaptations remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the beta-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR), a mediator of noradrenaline in the central nervous system, remodels neuronal morphology through compartmentalized signaling pathways that orchestrate distinct layers of gene regulation. Following stimulation, {beta}2ARs remain active on endosomes, and their intracellular signaling promotes dendritic growth and synapse formation. These structural effects are driven by two coordinated regulatory axes: PKA/CREB-dependent transcription of morphogenesis-related genes and PKA/mTOR-dependent translation of components of the protein synthesis machinery. Altogether, this work defines spatial and biochemical principles by which GPCR signaling drives structural reorganization and functional adaptations in neurons.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Applying this framework to five major neuropsychiatric disorders, we uncover a fundamental principle: the peak incidence of a disease precisely coincides with the developmental window of peak expression of its associated risk genes in the prefrontal cortex. These risk windows are characterized by distinct biological processes; for instance, childhood risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder aligns with a peak in presynaptic machinery gene expression, whereas late-life risk for Alzheimer's disease corresponds to heightened immune-related gene activity. Leveraging this principle of temporal convergence significantly improves the prioritization of disease genes. Our work establishes the developmental basis for the age of onset of complex diseases, providing a temporal roadmap for understanding disease mechanisms and developing age-appropriate therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Results reveal significantly higher bacterial abundance in BALF than in blood/cerebrospinal fluid, with community structures shaped by tissue microenvironments, geographical disparities, age, and clinical symptoms. Neonatal BALF harbors simplified microbiota dominated by probiotics, while diversity increases with age, showing marked differences between 1-3 and 6-12-year-olds.

Mutations in the CDKL5 gene cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterised by defects in synapse formation and function. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms by which CDKL5 mutations disrupt synaptic function and lead to epilepsy remain unclear. Here, we report that the major neuronal isoform of CDKL5 contains a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. We demonstrate that this motif mediates interactions with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and SHANK proteins, facilitating the recruitment of CDKL5 to the postsynaptic density. Disruption of CDKL5's PDZ-binding motif results in its mislocalisation and impaired spine formation. Additionally, we show that CDKL5 directly interacts with the mechanosensitive synaptic scaffold protein talin, via the N-terminal kinase domain of CDKL5 and the R8 rod domain of talin. Our findings establish how CDKL5 is targeted to synapses and suggest that its activity may be spatially regulated through talin-mediated mechanical signalling. We propose that the spatial positioning of the CDKL5 kinase domain might be mechanically-operated and regulated by talin domain unfolding. As talin undergoes structural transitions in its force-dependent binary switch domains, the kinase domain bound to R8 would be moved up and down within the synaptic compartment as a function of the changing talin conformation. These insights enhance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CDKL5 variants with premature stop codons and highlight the need to re-evaluate studies that have used C-terminally tagged or the non-PDZ-binding isoform of CDKL5 to assess its neuronal function.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

This was the second outbreak in China following the one that occurred in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province, in 2010. Moreover, the intensity of this outbreak was significantly greater than that of the previous one. Updates to 23 August, more than 10,000 human cases had been reported. Here, we present the first full genome sequence of the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) derived from field-trapped mosquitoes during the outbreak. Methods: Adult Aedes albopictus were BG-trap captured from residences and parklands in three hotspot towns with high density of confirmed human cases. Mosquitoes were morphologically identified and pooled by species, sex and environment types. RNA was extracted, screened by CHIKV RT-qPCR, then positive pools underwent sanger and whole-genome sequencing for complete sequences. Lineage and mutational profiles were inferred by maximum likelihood phylogenetic and comparison against human and mosquito genomes. The distribution of amino acid site mutations in different protein coding regions was also analyzed. Result: Through 11 days of collection using 10 BG-traps, 2,803 mosquitoes were captured. 1569 (55.97%) female Ae. albopictus were divided into 77 pools and 9.09% (7/77) of the pools tested positive for CHIKV. The local Ae. albopictus minimum infection rate (MIR, per 1000 females) was 4.46, while the MIR for residences in Lecong Town was the highest at 9.17. The MIR for parklands was slight higher than for residences (4.60 vs. 4.30). All the 5 Ae. albopictus-derived complete CHIKV genome clustered within ECSA-Indian Ocean lineage genotype, closely related to human-derived genomes on 2025 Reunion Island. Amino-acid mutations E1-A226V/E2-L210Q were detected in the strains, which enhanced adaptability to Ae. albopictus and increased the transmission capacity. Novel mutation observed on E1 and E2 were totally consist to the patient-derived CHIKV in 2025 Reunion Island. Conclusions: It was the first mosquito-derived CHIKV whole-genome during the 2025 Foshan outbreak, filling a critical gap between human case and entomological surveillance. Ae. albopictus was confirmed as the primary vector during the outbreak. The current outbreak CHIKV strain with particular amino-acid mutations had adapted to Ae. albopictus transmission. Compared to previous Chikungunya outbreaks over the past decade, the Foshan outbreak occurred earlier (early July), in a larger urban area (with a population of over 9.5 million), and with abundant breeding sites for the vector mosquito Ae. albopictus. However, the outbreak was quickly brought under control, with daily case numbers consistently decreasing, which is closely linked to the strong vector control measures implemented by the Chinese government in the early stages of the outbreak. Moreover, this event once again underscores the necessity of early monitoring of vector mosquitoes and the importance of implementing highly effective vector intervention measures as soon as possible after an outbreak occurs.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Existing embedding approaches either ignore space or rely on static neighborhood graphs that over- or under-smooth local heterogeneity. We present Glimmer (Graph-Learned Inference of Multiscale Molecular Embedding for Spatial Representation), a unified framework that learns adaptive neighborhood graphs by minimizing Dirichlet energy under a log-barrier regularizer. Beginning from a k-nearest neighbor scaffold, Glimmer adaptively reweights edges to balance molecular similarity and spatial proximity, yielding interpretable, locally smoothed embeddings. These graphs enable segmentation-free reconstruction from transcript localizations or fine bins and support the discovery of tissue niches at large tissue scales. Across diverse datasets and modalities (Slide-tags, Slide-seq, MERFISH, Xenium, and CODEX), Glimmer surpasses kernel and graph neural network based methods in clustering accuracy and spatial conservation. At the subcellular level, Glimmer corrects transcript-to-cluster misassignments on lymph node slides, thereby improving gene specificity within biological clusters and addressing a key challenge in spatial transcriptomics. At the tissue-wide scale, Glimmer enables accurate region identification, as demonstrated in tonsil tissue by resolving germinal center subregions, which in turn facilitates niche-specific immune profiling.

By analysing agonistic interactions, and dominance and association networks based on over four years of observations of five clans, we show that Asian elephants have a resolved but weakly structured within-clan dominance order. Female dyads showed unidirectionality, but triad motif structures of dominance networks suggested resolved dominance only in some clans. Older females were more dominant although there were moderate levels of reversals against age-based order and age difference did not dampen dyadic conflict.

GIPR function is shaped by spatiotemporal trafficking of this G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). While GPCR endocytosis is traditionally associated with {beta}-arrestin, GIPR internalization is only modestly dependent on this pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that GIPR engages a cytoskeletal motor, myosin VI to drive receptor endocytosis. GIPR engages the adaptor-motor complex through a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) at its C-ail. Interestingly, {beta}-arrestin binding to phosphorylated residues upstream of the PBM enhance myosin VI recruitment and activation. GIPR internalization is dependent on both receptor phosphorylation and the PBM site to recruit {beta}-arrestin and myosin VI, respectively. Synergistic engagement of {beta}-arrestin and myosin VI results in desensitization of GIP-stimulated cAMP signaling while activating pERK1/2 from endosomal compartments. Blocking myosin VI activity enhances insulin release in pancreatic beta cells, demonstrating a novel role for this pathway in regulating the physiological effects of GIPR. Our findings highlight the direct convergence of two independent trafficking pathways at the level of the receptor C-tail, with implications for the nuanced regulation of individual GPCRs through the differential engagement of {beta}-arrestin and myosin VI.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

The unexpected violation of this reward expectancy can induce a negative emotion usually referred to as frustration. Frustration responses have been characterized in rodents using a reward downshift paradigm. Although an anxiogenic effect of this reward downshift has been described, the associated long-term locomotor and behavioral patterns remain understudied. Furthermore, changes in the sleep-wake cycle or in sleep per se associated with sudden reward downshift currently remain underexplored. In this study, we combined wireless electrocorticographic/electromyographic (ECoG/EMG) recordings, accelerometer and video recordings in freely behaving mice to determine sleep-wake, locomotor and behavioral patterns associated with a reward downshift paradigm. Our results show an initial increase in locomotor activity and increased latency to rest following reward devaluation. Furthermore, we found that downshifted mice displayed a reduced number of episodes of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMs) during the light phase, and increased latency to non-REMs and REMs on the first two post-shift sessions. Finally, we found decreased locomotor activity and reduced nest quality over the second post-shift session compared to unshifted animals. Our results suggest that frustration induces a transient anxiogenic effect followed by a depressive-like state. Moreover, our study has the strength of using a novel approach for home-cage behavior analysis that combines machine-learning-based tracking, long-term average body-acceleration, ECoG/EMG recordings, and home-cage nest quality assessment.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

D.; Wang, Y.; Michaels, T.; Shum, H.

However, the mechanisms governing this condensate aging remain largely elusive. Liquid-liquid phase separation of minimal biomolecular building blocks, such as small peptides or nucleotides, offers ideal model systems to dissect the mechanisms underlying condensate formation and aging. Here, we report that condensates formed by Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) undergo liquid-to-solid phase transitions (LSPT) in macromolecularly crowded environments, evolving from dynamic liquid droplets into urchin-like fibrillar aggregates. In the initial stages of aging, small aggregates actively engulf surrounding droplets via direct contact and rapid wetting-driven merging. As aging progresses, internal flows emerge within condensates, with velocities oriented toward the nearest aggregate core. These flows arise endogenously from ATP fibrillization through the Marangoni effect and result in a long-range chemotaxis ripening process that facilitates transport of ATP molecules from peripheral droplets to a central aggregate. The Marangoni effect also drives the long-range motion of liquid droplets on hydrophobic surfaces towards the aggregates, representing a novel form of dialytaxis. These findings provide crucial and previously unrecognized dynamic behaviors and insights into the physical principles underlying condensate aging.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

However, although sleep-dependent coordination of activity between hippocampus and neocortex is essential for memory consolidation, much less is known about how sleep loss affects neocortical input to hippocampus, or excitatory-inhibitory balance within neocortical structures. We aimed to test how the synaptic structures of SST interneurons in lateral and medial entorhinal cortex (LEC and MEC), which are the major neocortical input to hippocampus, are affected by brief sleep disruption in the hours following learning. We used Brainbow 3.0 to label SST interneurons in the LEC or MEC of male SST-IRES-Cre transgenic mice. We then compared synaptic structures in labeled neurons after single trial contextual fear conditioning (CFC) followed by either a 6-h period of ad lib sleep, or gentle handling sleep deprivation (SD), focusing on cortical layers providing input to hippocampus. Dendritic spine density among EC SST interneurons was altered in a subregion-specific manner, with dramatic alterations in dendritic spine type distributions and reductions in spine size in LEC, but not MEC, after post-CFC SD. Our data suggest that the synaptic connectivity of SST interneurons is significantly reduced in LEC when learning is followed by sleep disruption. This suggests that post-learning sleep loss disrupts hippocampus-dependent memory processing in part through altered excitatory-inhibitory balance in neocortical structures providing input to hippocampus. They also provide more mechanistic insight into sleeps role in coordinating neocortical-hippocampal communication in the context of memory consolidation.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Recruitment to DNA damage sites has been traditionally understood to depend exclusively on interaction with PARP1 and PARP1 mediated PARylation. Here, we report for the first time the discovery of GCN5 and TADA2B, components of histone acetyltransferase module of SAGA complex, as novel XRCC1 binding partners that provide critical fine-tuning control over repair site localization. We demonstrate that these SAGA complex components bind XRCC1 constitutively via distinct BRCT domain interactions; GCN5 mainly to BRCT I and TADA2B mainly to BRCT II , independent of DNA damage status or GCN5's acetyltransferase activity. Depletion of either protein significantly impairs XRCC1 recruitment efficiency, while paradoxically rescuing focal retention defects in BRCT II deficient XRCC1 mutants. This dual regulatory behavior reveals a regulatory mechanism where constitutive protein interactions optimize normal XRCC1 function but become counterproductive when XRCC1 is structurally compromised, particularly in the BRCT II domain. Analysis of the SCAR26 associated variant, which disrupts TADA2B binding while maintaining LIG3 interaction, confirms this dual regulatory model and provides molecular insights into potential disease pathophysiology.

The shift between these two states is driven by evolutionary conserved transcription factors. Cell exit from the epithelium of origin is considered to be a mere consequence of progressive adhesion loss due to transcriptional repression of genes encoding molecules such as E-Cadherin or cell polarity regulators. Here we show in the Drosophila leg that, counterintuitively, adhesions (as well as cell polarity) are maintained during cell exit, while an apico-basal force is applied on E-Cadherin complexes in vivo. By combining a genetic screen, optogenetics and laser ablation experiments, we found that this pulling force originates from transient basal filopodia-like protrusions, formed as soon as cells start to exit. Finally, apical cell detachment requires alpha-Spectrin activity, suggesting that the lateral cortex is required to efficiently transmit basal forces up to the apical cell pole. Our results indicate that, in a mature tissue, cell exit during EMT is a mechanically controlled process. Such a mechanism driving EMT without of E-Cadherin loss could fuel metastatic dissemination of collectively migrating cancer cells.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

However, prior work has not established which model concepts are causally necessary for pLM performance on downstream tasks. Here, we adapt causal activation patching to the pLM setting and. perform it in SAE latent space to extract the minimal circuit responsible for accuracy in a contact prediction task for two case study proteins.

Path-level ablations confirm the causal dependence of domain latents on upstream motif latents.

Hence, it is important to investigate the correlation between CMA and the antioxidative stress within tumor cells and elucidate its specific mechanism. LAMP2A expression profiles in gastric carcinoma cell lines and clinical specimens were quantified via qPCR, WB, and immunohistochemical analysis. An in vitro oxidative stress model was established through 24-hour hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure. Gastric cancer cell models with knockdown and overexpression of LAMP2A were established. Apoptotic indices and proliferative capacity were assessed through high-throughput flow cytometry and CCK-8 viability assays. The interaction between LAMP2A and DJ-1 was investigated via co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. This study demonstrates that LAMP2A is upregulated in gastric cancer and further induced by oxidative stress. Down-regulated LAMP2A impaired CMA functionality, sensitizing gastric cancer cells to oxidative cytotoxicity and significantly augmenting apoptosis rates. Elevated DJ-1 levels in gastric cancer cells are further amplified by oxidative stress, with severe stress enhancing LAMP2A-DJ-1 colocalization. Mechanistically, CMA inhibition precipitated accumulation of hyperoxidized DJ-1 isoforms, concomitant with pro-apoptotic BAX upregulation and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 downregulation. We found hyperoxidized DJ-1 as a novel CMA substrate. The LAMP2A-DJ-1 regulatory axis represents a critical adaptive mechanism whereby CMA activation maintains redox homeostasis in gastric malignancies.

SRSF1 expression is regulated in part by proteostasis. However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear.

USP39 expression is elevated in PDAC tumors and precancerous lesions, and correlates with poor patient survival. USP39 knockdown suppresses PDAC cell proliferation and migration, effects that are partially rescued by SRSF1 overexpression.

A key piece of evidence underpinning this hypothesis has been the crocodyliform Doratodon carcharidens from the Late Cretaceous of Europe, previously interpreted as closely related to Gondwanan taxa. However, the material attributed to this species is fragmentary, and its skeletal anatomy (critical for phylogenetic inference) remains poorly understood. Here we describe a new partial skull of Doratodon carcharidens which represents some of the most complete material of Gondwanan taxa in the European Cretaceous. Our updated phylogenetic analysis unexpectedly and robustly places D. carcharidens among the Laurasian clade Paralligatoridae and reveals that morphological similarities to Gondwanan ziphosuchians, such as ziphodont dentition, are the result of ecomorphological convergence rather than shared ancestry. By reinterpreting the systematic position of further taxa representing biogeographic enigma, such as Ogresuchus furatus, our phylogeny implies a major role of the primary breakup of Pangea into Laurasia and Gondwana for crocodyliform divergence. A critical reassessment of the purported evidence for Gondwanan fish and tetrapod immigrants in Europe reveals that it is largely based on highly fragmentary and sporadic specimens, as well as weakly supported phylogenetic hypotheses. Given the sparse and uneven Jurassic and Cretaceous fossil record in both Europe and Africa, it remains plausible that taxa previously interpreted as Gondwanan dispersers instead represent vicariant relicts. Our results conflict with recent paleobiogeographic scenarios, highlight the absence of compelling evidence for the Eurogondwana hypothesis and instead support a primary Gondwana-Laurasia split.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

While gestational exposures are well studied, little is known about how preconception exposures influence fertility and offspring health. Phthalate exposure altered estrous cyclicity, with dams spending more time in proestrus and less in metestrus but did not significantly impact implantation or litter size. At E14.5, exposed fetuses exhibited increased bodyweights, accompanied by an expansion of the placental junctional zone in males. Altered bodyweight persisted into adulthood, however adulthood offspring displayed a reduction in bodyweight. RNA-sequencing revealed widespread transcriptional reprogramming in female placentas (518 DEGs) affecting immune regulation, steroid metabolism, and extracellular matrix remodeling, while male placentas exhibited only 9 DEGs but showed structural alterations. In offspring livers, transcriptomic shifts were sex-specific: females displayed downregulation of metabolic and immune genes (e.g., Cyp7a1, Mthfr, H2-DMB1), while males showed upregulation of immune and signaling genes (e.g., Elf4, Adm2, Ly6a). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that preconception phthalate exposure induces subtle but biologically meaningful maternal endocrine disruption, alters placental structure and function, and reprograms offspring growth and liver transcriptomes in a sex-specific manner. This work identifies the preconception window as a critical period of vulnerability for EDC impacts on reproductive success and intergenerational health.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Using Affinity Selection-Mass Spectrometry (AS-MS) screening, we identified As48, a novel small molecule that binds TREM2 with high affinity. Biophysical validation confirmed s 7-fold selectivity over TREM1. Cellular assays demonstrated that As48 functions as a TREM2 agonist, activating SYK phosphorylation and enhancing microglial phagocytosis. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that As48 binds near the cleavage region, establishing hydrogen bonds with Gly68 and reducing conformational flexibility in regions 58-102. Based on this structural insight, we investigated the effect of As48 on TREM2 ectodomain shedding and discovered inhibition of receptor shedding without affecting ADAM10/17 protease activities, representing the first small molecule with anti-shedding properties through conformational restriction of protease accessibility. Importantly, As48 displayed favorable pharmacokinetics with potential for brain permeability, supporting its translational relevance. Through its dual and simultaneous promotion of receptor activation and prevention of shedding, As48 represents a paradigm shift in TREM2 modulation and neuroinflammatory drug discovery.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

The present study evaluates its efficiency to protect liver cells during acute (biliary obstruction, BO) and chronic (primary biliary cholangitis, PBC and primary sclerosing cholangitis, PSC) cholestatic situations. BA-glucuronides (G) were first profiled in sera from control, PBC, PSC and BO donors. An impressive accumulation of BA-Gs, formed from toxic BAs, is observed in sera from BO patients. Liver samples from control, PBC, or PSC donors and human hepatic cells were exposed to BAs, BA-G, agonists of the BA sensors Pregnane X-Receptor (PXR) or Farnesoid X-Receptor (FXR) and were analyzed for the expression of BA-conjugating UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes using quantitative RT-PCR and/or immnunoblot. Expression of the BA-conjugating UGT1A3, 1A4, and 2B4 enzymes was increased in hepatocytes exposed to BA levels mimicking BO. PXR activation also induced expression of the 3 UGTs, while FXR agonists only activated the UGT1A4 and 2B4 genes. Gelshift and luciferase transfection assays identified PXR response elements within UGT1A3 and 1A4 gene promoters. Finally, Inflammation markers have been reduced in hepatocytes treated with BA-G instead of BA. Conclusion: The present study identifies glucuronidation as a self-defense mechanism against BA toxicity during cholestasis. While of limited efficiency by itself, this endogenous mechanism is proposed as a novel pharmacological target in the treatment of chronic cholestatic diseases.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Mutations in ion channel genes expressed in both brain and heart represent SUDEP risk factors because they can disrupt neural and cardiac rhythms, providing a unified explanation for seizures and lethal arrhythmias. However, the relative contributions of brain-driven mechanisms, heart-intrinsic processes, and seizures to cardiac dysfunction in epilepsy remain unclear. Here, we investigated the heart-specific role of the Kcna1 gene, which encodes Kv1.1 voltage-gated potassium channel -subunits expressed in both neurons and cardiomyocytes, where they shape action potential firing and influence seizure and arrhythmia susceptibility. We generated cardiac-specific Kcna1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking Kv1.1 selectively in cardiomyocytes and assessed their cardiac function using in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology. Cardiac Kv1.1 deficiency prolonged action potentials in atrial, but not ventricular, cardiomyocytes, demonstrating a direct role for Kv1.1 in atrial repolarization. Despite these cellular effects, cKOs exhibited normal lifespans, electrocardiographic features, heart rate variability, pacing-induced arrhythmia susceptibility, contractility, seizure susceptibility, and seizure-induced mortality. Thus, while loss of cardiac Kv1.1 was sufficient to impair atrial repolarization, it did not reproduce the broader cardiac abnormalities seen in global Kcna1 knockouts. Given the higher mortality rates of global compared with neural-specific knockouts in our previous studies, cardiac Kv1.1 deficiency, while not lethal alone, may increase vulnerability to seizure-related death when combined with neural deficiency, consistent with a brain-heart dyssynergy that lowers the threshold for fatal events.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

In this study, we first report on a method to purify autophagic compartments in Arabidopsis, by combining cell fractionation and immuno-isolation in native conditions. Second, proteomic analyses of ATG-isolated membranes allowed us to establish a list of candidate proteins involved in autophagy, membrane remodeling, vesicular trafficking and lipid metabolism and colocalizing with autophagic compartments after transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana.

Sapwood densities varied 50% less than heartwood densities, and branchwood densities varied 30% less than trunkwood densities. Individuals in extreme environments (dry, hot, acidic soils) had higher wood density than conspecifics elsewhere (+0.02 g cm-3, ~4% of the mean).

V.", "abstract": "The main drawback of traditional ecological models is the inability to model local interactions between individuals. As a consequence, it was impossible to mathematically model individual-based mechanisms of direct and indirect competition, which hampers the understanding of ecological dynamics. To overcome this problem, we developed a fully transparent mechanistic analog of the classical Lotka-Volterra phenomenological model based on explicitly explainable artificial intelligence (AI) of the glass-box type. In this paper, on an individual-based model, we present (i) a rigorous mechanism of inverted competitive exclusion where, all else being equal, the weaker species in direct competition defeats the stronger species through indirect exploitative competition and (ii) a rigorous mechanism of coexistence of complete competitors resulting from a combination of accounting for microhabitat regeneration, moderate reproduction, a certain habitat size and boundary conditions. Both presented mechanisms go beyond the classical formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, as in our model two species with different competitiveness compete for a single limiting resource in one homogeneous bounded ecosystem. We have shown that individual-based modeling of direct and indirect competition mechanisms allows for a more detailed understanding of the causal mechanisms of interspecific competition. Such understanding is necessary to refine formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, to search for mechanisms of competitive coexistence, to predict ecosystem behavior, and to develop conservation strategies. Our approach allows us to study discrete systems with fundamentally discrete mathematics, which opens up new opportunities for achieving accuracy, clarity, rigor, and explainability in studies of complex systems.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Smartphone behaviour, which involves sustained engagement across diverse cognitive processes provides a fresh avenue to examine these bursts. In this study, we used EEG to measure {beta}-bursts as participants freely interacted with their smartphones using their right hand for ~ 80 min. Bursts were detected across the scalp, with bilateral sensorimotor electrodes accumulating more periods with bursts than the rest of the electrodes. There was a brain-wide reduction in the probability of bursts preceding a touchscreen touch, followed by an increase, with the strongest modulation in the left sensorimotor electrodes. Interestingly, touchscreen touches sometimes occurred during the bursts. We further examined the intra-burst touch rate across the scalp and found that the rate was lower over the left sensorimotor cortex than the rest of electrodes. Finally, we characterised the diverse behaviours in terms of the interval between touchscreen interactions to find that the behaviours with bursts were typically longer than the behaviours without bursts. We propose that the apparently continuous stream of smartphone touches is supported by brief, spatially localised transient bursts of inhibition. These transients may help support the computational flexibility in distributed neural networks needed for processing continuous motor output and integrating the rich sensory information.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

In this study, we approached recall by shifting the focus from internal neuronal representations to brain-environment interactions, employing precise tracking of gaze dynamics within a well-controlled virtual reality (VR) setting. We found that each verbal report of recalled event was consistently preceded by a gradual process of brain-environment coupling: fixational pauses became progressively longer, while gaze direction slowly converged on a specific spatial location associated with the memorized object-a recall-specific location (RSL). Upon the initiation of the verbal report, gaze rapidly diverged from the RSL. Chunked verbal reports were associated with convergence onto shared or spatially clustered RSLs. Moreover, when recall occurred in the same spatial context as encoding, participants recalled objects in the order they were encountered and RSLs were more correlated with gaze locations during encoding. These findings reveal a direct mechanistic dependence of memory recall on the environment and support the view that the environment is not merely a context for memory, but an integral component of the memory itself.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Our analyses revealed that aging promotes lipid droplet accumulation in brain ECs. These lipid-laden brain ECs exhibit a transcriptomic signature indicative of impaired blood-brain barrier function, increased cellular senescence, and inflammation in aging. Furthermore, lipid accumulation is associated with an altered metabolic phenotype characterized by increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased glycolysis, and impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain activity in the ECs of the aging brain.

Inactivating mutations in NOX2 cause chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a severe immunodeficiency associated with recurrent infections and dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation. Recurrent oral ulcers, stomatitis, gingivitis, and other inflammatory issues affecting the oral mucosa have been observed in patients with CGD; however, the underlying mechanisms are not known. Here, we present evidence that the extensive inflammatory destruction of oral mucosal tissues observed in Nox2-deficient or CybbKO mice was not caused by impaired antimicrobial surveillance against oral pathobionts but instead resulted from a cell-intrinsic dysregulation of neutrophil inflammatory responses. Transcriptional and cellular profiling of oral tissues isolated from wild-type and CybbKO mice showed a dominant neutrophil signature, which was accompanied by a significant upregulation of several bone-resorbing, tissue-degrading inflammatory cytokines and a reduced expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulated genes. Mechanistically, hyperinflammatory responses were mitigated by restoring Nrf2 transcriptional activity using a synthetic agonist. Thus, our studies show that Nox2 oxidase and its derived reactive oxygen species are crucial for balanced recruitment and cell-intrinsic regulation of neutrophil inflammatory responses within oral tissues in an Nrf2-dependent manner.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Anti-insulin germinal center B cells are uniquely able to present pathogenic insulin epitopes and drive anti-insulin T cells to adopt a T follicular helper fate. T cell expression of BCL6, a key transcriptional repressor in the germinal center response, is essential for spontaneous diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. However, the impact of T cells on pro-pathogenic anti-insulin B cell activity is still poorly understood. Here, we show that VH125SD.NOD mice with T cell loss of BCL6 still produce peripheral anti-insulin B cells yet are protected against diabetes (relative to Bcl6-sufficient controls). This protection was associated with reduced activation, proliferation, germinal center differentiation, and pancreatic infiltration of insulin-binding B cells. Minimally supervised analysis revealed insulin-binding B cells skew towards atypical memory B cell subsets specifically in pancreas and pancreatic lymph nodes, which was reduced by Bcl6{Delta}CD4 loss. Overall, this work suggests BCL6-expressing T cells are pivotal to license pathogenic insulin-binding B cells. Our findings support BCL6 inhibition as a promising T1D immunotherapy, even after insulin autoimmunity is established in the B cell repertoire.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

M.; Gaffen, S.", "abstract": "Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), caused by the commensal pathobiont Candida albicans, affects >75% of women, marring quality of life and incurring significant health costs. Estrogen (E2) activity is tightly linked to VVC susceptibility, and preclinical models employ E2 to establish vaginal colonization. Unlike most forms of candidiasis, VVC is not considered to be a condition of immune compromise. Rather, VVC is characterized by high levels of PMNs and inflammatory cytokines that drive immunopathology but fail to clear the fungus. The role of the Type 17 pathway in this condition is controversial. Th17 signature profiles are upregulated in vaginal tissue during VVC in mice and humans. However, loss of individual Th17 components by gene deletion or anti-cytokine administration does not predispose to disease. Here, we reveal an IL-1/Type 17-driven arm of immunity that operates to control C. albicans in the vaginal mucosa independently of estrogen. Il1r-/- mice subjected to VVC bore high vaginal loads, accompanied by reduced IL-17A/F and IL-22 expression and suppressed PMN influx. Although mice lacking IL-17, IL-22/IL-22R or IL-23 individually exhibited normal susceptibility to VVC, mice lacking receptors for both cytokines (Il17raIl22ra1-/-) had high and persistent fungal loads, with increased vaginal tissue damage and elevated IL-1a/b levels. Thus, IL-1R serves as a master regulator of protective Type 17 responses, and moreover IL-1 signaling alone is insufficient to control fungal colonization. Interestingly, Il1r-/- and Il17raIl22ra1-/- mice showed high fungal colonization in the absence of exogenous estrogen, and this susceptibility persisted even when mice were given progesterone to prevent estrus. Together, these data reveal an estrogen-independent pathway of vaginal antifungal host defense mediated by combinatorial actions of IL-17 and IL-22 and governed by upstream IL-1R signaling.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Short peptides have emerged as promising vectors, including cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and brain-penetrating peptides (BPPs).

Here, we compiled a curated dataset of 490 peptides, encompassing CPPs, BPPs, and non-BPP controls, and systematically analysed their amino acid composition, sequence distribution, and physicochemical descriptors. BPPs were found to exhibit a more balanced distribution of cationic, polar, and hydrophobic residues compared to CPPs, which were enriched in contiguous arginine and lysine blocks. Physicochemical analysis revealed that BPPs had lower charge density, greater stability, and reduced aromaticity relative to CPPs. Dimensionality reduction confirmed BPPs occupy an intermediate chemical space between CPPs and non-BPPs. Machine learning classification, particularly with Extra Trees models, achieved strong performance in discriminating peptide classes, with charge, instability index, and aromaticity identified as the most predictive features.

In adults, the reporter was expressed strongly in testis and to a lesser extent in other tissues, including weak, sporadic expression in skeletal muscles, reminiscent of mosaic DUX4 expression in FSHD.

Centuries of silviculture have homogenized forests and their species communities globally, reducing biodiversity. To test whether restoring forest structural complexity can promote biodiversity, we conducted a large-scale, spatially explicit landscape experiment. At 11 sites across Germany, we compared bat and bird diversity in forests with experimentally enhanced heterogeneity by increasing deadwood and canopy complexity to homogeneous production forests. Both taxa were investigated by autonomous acoustic recorders and automatic species identification. We quantified within-patch (-), between-patch ({beta}-), and landscape-level ({gamma}-) diversity, emphasizing infrequent to highly frequent species for taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. The pairwise comparisons of the sites were synthesized using a newly developed meta-analysis of rarefaction-extrapolation curves. {gamma}-diversity increased significantly in structurally heterogeneous forests for both taxa, albeit through distinct taxon-specific mechanisms. Bat {gamma}-diversity gains were primarily driven by higher {beta}-diversity, indicating greater dissimilarity in species assemblages among patches, while bird {gamma}-diversity increased via higher -diversity within patches. Bat diversity increases were mainly taxonomic, suggesting functional similarity in the communities, whereas birds showed the highest gains in functional diversity, indicating that experimental treatments resulted in greater trait dissimilarity. Our results provide experimental evidence under real-world conditions that {gamma}-diversity can be shaped by different diversity mechanisms. These patterns likely originate from differences in activity ranges, such as the large-scale movements of foraging bats in contrast to the more spatially restricted, territorial behavior of birds. This highlights the need for taxon-specific restoration strategies in homogenized landscapes.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Should aging research focus on reversing aging in older individuals, or on pausing its progression at earlier ages? We address this question with evolutionary biology. Classic evolutionary theories of aging - damage accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and the disposable soma - consider aging as a detrimental byproduct of evolution. From this perspective, rejuvenation should confer strong fitness advantages and therefore be expected to evolve in species experiencing substantial aging in the wild. Its rarity in nature should thus be interpreted as evidence of its mechanistic implausibility. Yet, rejuvenation does occur in a few species, and, paradoxically, it is typically induced by stress but not used under optimal conditions. Using mathematical modeling of lifespan plasticity in eusocial insects, we show that this pattern cannot be reconciled with classic theories of aging, revealing an internal contradiction between these theories and the observed avoidance of rejuvenation. By contrast, the pathogen control hypothesis - which interprets aging as an adaptive, programmed process -offers a consistent evolutionary framework for understanding and potentially achieving rejuvenation.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

CD97, also known as ADGRE5, is an aGPCR that is upregulated in various cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma (GBM), and their respective cancer stem cells. Here, we developed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting CD97 and assessed their efficacy against AML and GBM cells.

Because of its biological similarity to human mucosal melanoma, canine OMM represents a valuable spontaneous model for translational immunotherapy studies. Anti-PD-1 antibody therapy has shown promise in canine OMM; however, predictive biomarkers for treatment response and survival have not been identified. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, investigator-initiated clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a caninized anti-canine PD-1 monoclonal antibody (ca-4F12-E6) in 150 dogs with advanced OMM. The dogs were administered 3 mg/kg ca-4F12-E6 intravenously every two weeks. Treatment response was assessed using cRECIST v1.0. Biomarker analyses included peripheral blood parameters, cytokine/chemokines, peripheral lymphocyte subsets, microsatellite instability (MSI), immunohistochemistry for immune cell and mismatch repair protein markers, and RNA sequencing of the tumor tissue. Associations with clinical outcomes were determined by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: The best overall response rate was 16.7%. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 40.0% of the dogs, which were primarily grade 1-3. Increased baseline white blood cell, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly associated with poor response, shorter progression-free survival (PFS), and reduced overall survival (OS).

This is despite the fact that the permeability of AmB-based channels favors cations, and these channels lose their capacity to increase airway surface liquid (ASL) pH in CF airway epithelia at high concentrations. We hypothesized that modifying such channels to favor anion permeability would make them more CFTR-like and thus increase their potential therapeutic effects compared to AmB. Here we show that a synthetic derivative of AmB, AmB-AA, which has an added positively charged appendage and forms ion channels with an improved relative permeability to anions, outperformed AmB in increasing the ASL pH in CF airway epithelia at both low and high concentrations. Further modifications led to another AmB derivative, C2'epiAmB-AA, that also minimized cholesterol binding and thus toxicity to cultured CF airway epithelia and was an effective surrogate for CFTR in primary cultured airway epithelia from people with CF.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

During a glucose ramp (1.8-10.8mM), -cell Ca2+ oscillations were heterogeneous, antiphasic to {beta}-cells, and inversely correlated with {delta}-cells.

Unfortunately, only a limited number of preclinical models have been developed for investigating cardiovascular dysfunction following cervical SCI. Furthermore, the broader consequences of cervical SCI on aerobic capacity and muscle endurance during physiological stress testing also remains understudied preclinically. Therefore, in this study we assessed potential deficits across multiple physiological systems in a rat model of cervical SCI using a battery of stress tests. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 20) received either a C8 midline contusion (cSCI) or laminectomy alone as a control (LAM). Exercise stress testing was conducted to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness and recovery using a metabolic treadmill, or forelimb fitness using the isometric pull task. Orthostatic stress testing and pharmacological stress testing were also performed to more directly challenge the cardiovascular system. Our findings demonstrate a decline in aerobic fitness in cSCI rats, as evidenced by dysregulated excess post-exercise oxygen consumption. cSCI rats also exhibited impaired muscle endurance compared to LAM. During orthostatic stress testing, 70% of cSCI rats experienced an approximately 25 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure and 20 mmHg decrease in diastolic blood pressure, in addition to modest but significant decreases in heart rate, myocardial contractility index, stroke volume index, and cardiac output index. During dobutamine infusion, cardiac output index and stroke volume index were significantly reduced following cSCI compared to LAM. Overall, these stress testing results suggest that preclinical cervical SCI in rats can lead to, and therefore model, clinically relevant impairments in cardiopulmonary exercise performance, muscle endurance, and cardiovascular function.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

In Arabidopsis thaliana, three paralogs: PAM18-1, PAM18-2, and PAM18-3, encode J-domain proteins homologous to yeast PAM18, which stimulates the ATPase activity of mitochondrial HSP70 (mtHSP70) during protein translocation. Here, we identify PAM18-3 as the most highly and ubiquitously expressed paralog and demonstrate its critical role in mitochondrial function and plant development. Genetic disruption of PAM18-3 caused severe vegetative and reproductive defects, including reduced root length, smaller rosette size with fewer leaves, decreased plant height, shorter siliques, reduced seed set, and increased seed abortion. These phenotypes were fully rescued in complemented lines expressing PAM18-3. Ultrastructural analyses revealed profound mitochondrial abnormalities in mutants, whereas chloroplast architecture remained unaffected. Functional assays showed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and altered respiratory flux with a compensatory induction of the alternative oxidase (AOX) pathway. Transcript profiling revealed upregulation of AOX genes and multiple components of the mitochondrial TIM23 import apparatus and associated chaperones. Import assays demonstrated reduced mitochondrial accumulation of canonical TIM23 substrates, including IDH, ATP{beta}, and SHMT1, confirming a defect in matrix protein translocation. Consistently, pam18-3 mutants accumulated elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exhibited strong induction of mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes, including key transcription factors mediating retrograde signaling.

Using a dimensional approach, we recruited 110 healthy young adults who completed self-report questionnaires measuring autistic traits and camouflaging as well as depression and anxiety, and underwent resting-state fMRI scans. Using the 300-node Seitzman atlas encompassing 13 functional networks, we examined the interaction between camouflaging and autistic traits on brain network connectivity. Results showed that among individuals with higher autistic traits, greater camouflaging was associated with hyperconnectivities between the Default Mode (DMN) and Cingulo-Opercular Networks (CON), and within the CON. Crucially, DMN-CON hyperconnectivity mediated the relationship between camouflaging and potential mental health cost (i.e., depression and anxiety scores) but only in individuals with higher autistic traits. These findings reveal a specific neuro-compensatory mechanism underlying autistic camouflaging involving self-referential and executive control systems and provide a neurobiological explanation for its potential mental health burden, highlighting the need for societal changes that reduce the pressure for such adaptations.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

We subsequently tested how participants adapted their walking patterns during free exploration trials at the large split-belt ratio and at a new, smaller split-belt ratio. Our results showed that during guided exploration, participants were exposed to energetically favorable conditions.

In the SNc, different dopamine neuron subtypes show varying susceptibility patterns to PD, complicating our understanding. This study uses intersectional genetic mouse models to uncover synaptic perturbations in vulnerable dopamine neurons, focusing on the LRRK2 kinase, a protein closely linked to PD. Through a combination of immunofluorescence and advanced proximity labeling methods, we found higher LRRK2 expression in the most vulnerable dopamine neuron subclusters. High-resolution imaging revealed that pathogenic LRRK2 disrupts release sites in vulnerable dopamine axons, leading to decreased in vivo evoked striatal dopamine release in mice with LRRK2 mutations. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicate that mutant LRRK2 increases the phosphorylation of RAB3 proteins, reducing their interactions with RIM1/2 effector proteins and impacting their synaptic functions. Overall, this research highlights the cell-autonomous dysfunctions caused by mutant LRRK2 in the neurons that are primarily affected by the disease.

We factorially manipulated the efficiency of stimulus-response cue discrimination by varying the elongation of the singleton and the efficiency of singleton localization by varying the color similarity between the singleton and distractors. The effectiveness of the manipulations was revealed by the response times on correct trials that were separately modified by the singleton localizability and stimulus-response cue discriminability, by the incidence of localization and response selection errors with separately modified error response times. Saccade velocity was higher on correct relative to error trials and was inversely proportional to response time. Saccade velocity was separately modified by singleton localizability and stimulus-response cue discriminability. Distinct patterns of error rates and saccade velocity across monkeys indicated individual differences in decision-making strategies.

Antidepressant and placebo induce widespread cortical metabolic changes after six weeks of treatment6 and increase endogenous opioid release within one week, yet these findings offer limited insight into how interregional brain communication is altered by antidepressants or placebo.

Cardiolipin, a unique phospholipid that is exclusively synthesized and localized in the IMM, modulates the biophysical properties of the electron transport chain (ETC) in tissues with high energy demands, such as cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle. However, it remains unclear whether cardiolipin is also important for metabolic remodeling during T helper (Th) cell differentiation. In this study, we show that cardiolipin transacylation, catalyzed by the enzyme Tafazzin, supports the clonal expansion and effector function of inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells in vitro and in models of autoimmune colitis and encephalomyelitis. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that loss of Tafazzin-mediated cardiolipin maturation induces a metabolic and transcriptional stress response in Th cells to compensate for impaired coupling efficiency of the ETC complexes and disrupted cellular redox homeostasis. However, the genetic program that restores cellular homeostasis and mitigates oxidative stress concurrently impairs the effector functions of inflammatory T cells, such as cytokine production.

Mycolactone inhibits the Sec61-dependent co-translational translocation of signal peptide-bearing secreted and membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. Sec61 inhibition leads to accumulation of mislocalised proteins in the cytosol and initially triggers an integrated stress response-dependent activation of autophagy that contributes to cell survival. Here we show that sustained exposure of cells to mycolactone causes a block in late-stage autophagy and induces nuclear translocation of the lysosomal stress marker TFEB. This coincides with loss of ATP6AP1 and ATP6AP2, Sec61-substrates required for assembly of the Vacuolar-ATPase, leading to reduced lysosomal biogenesis and acidification. This compromises the cell's capacity to withstand the proteostatic stress caused by Sec61 inhibition and impairs the ability of phagocytes to combat infection with M. ulcerans.

Here, we adapted PVCs for targeted delivery to plants by engineering their tail fibers to recognize a natural plant immune receptor, FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE2 (FLS2).

Thus, we propose that IL-27 pre-stimulation may restore their suppressive function and migration (via CCR6, CCR7, S100A11 and S1PR4) to the central nervous system (CNS) in future clinical trials.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

S.; Zhang, S.; Shen, Y.; Zhou, Q.; Zhou, X.; Wang, C.; Shen, X.", "abstract": "Extracting coherent, biologically meaningful insights from vast, complex multi-omics data remains challenging. Currently, pathway enrichment analysis serves as a cornerstone for the functional interpretation of such data. However, conventional approaches often suffer from extensive functional redundancy caused by shared molecular components and overlapping pathway definitions across databases. This redundancy can obscure key biological signals and compromise the interpretability of pathway enrichment results. Here, we present MAPA (Functional Module Identification and Annotation for Pathway Analysis Results Using Large Language Models [LLM]), an open-source computational framework that resolves redundancy and enhances pathway analysis result interpretation. MAPA computes functional similarity between pathways using LLM-based text embeddings, enabling comparison across different databases. It constructs pathway similarity networks and identifies functional modules via community detection algorithms. Crucially, MAPA employs LLMs for automated functional annotation, integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate comprehensive and real-time biological summaries and reduce hallucinations. Benchmarking demonstrated MAPA's superior performance: the biotext embedding similarity showed a large effect size (Cliff's {delta} = 0.96) compared with the Jaccard index ({delta} = 0.73), and module identification achieved high accuracy (Adjusted Rand Index [ARI] = 0.95) versus existing methods (ARI = 0.23-0.33). Human expert evaluation confirmed that MAPA's annotations match expert-quality interpretations. Finally, a multi-omics aging case study illustrates that MAPA uncovers coherent functional modules and generates insights extending beyond conventional pathway analyses. Collectively, MAPA represents a significant advance in redundancy-aware pathway analysis, transforming pathway enrichment results from fragmented lists into biologically coherent narratives. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, MAPA offers researchers a robust, scalable tool for deriving deep mechanistic insights from complex and vast multi-omics datasets, marking a new direction for AI-driven bioinformatics.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

However, the widely studied type strain, A. marina MBIC11017, is atypical compared to most cyanobacteria, due to the absence of low energy chlorophylls (red forms) within its Photosystem I complex. Consequently, Photosystem I and Photosystem II in the MBIC11017 strain share similar absorption spectra and are incapable of absorbing photons >740 nm. Recently, it has been discovered that the absorption and emission spectra from other A. marina strains are significantly more red-shifted than the MBIC11017 strain. Here, we have combined advanced spectroscopy and high-resolution cryo-EM to characterize Photosystem I from Acaryochloris marina NIES-2412, a red-shifted strain that is more representative of the A. marina species. The structure resolves all 96 chlorophylls and cofactors and indicates the location of the red chlorophyll forms. Spectroscopic analysis reveals two distinct types of red forms: one arising from the classical mechanism of charge transfer-exciton mixing, and the other from purely excitonic interactions. Furthermore, we have identified PsaX2 as a critical subunit that fine-tunes the pigment geometries and energies to enable the formation of these red forms. Together, these findings reveal how NIES-2412 PSI balances far-red light harvesting and energy trapping, highlighting its distinct strategy for adaptation in far-red light environments and redefining A. marina MBIC11017 as an atypical representative of the species.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we performed transcriptomic profiling of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and publicly available tumor datasets to systematically compare intratumoral gene expression across cutaneous and rare melanoma subtypes. We identified a convergent downregulation of innate immune pathogen sensing (IIPS) and type I interferon signaling pathways in rare melanomas compared to cutaneous, with lower expression also observed in anti-PD-1 non-responder tumors. CIBERSORT deconvolution of immune populations revealed that lower IIPS gene-expressing tumors exhibited reduced CD8 T cell and memory CD4 T cell infiltration, and enrichment of M2 macrophages, consistent with a more immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In vitro screening of epigenetic and immunomodulatory compounds revealed that the DNA hypomethylating agent decitabine robustly induced IIPS and adaptive immune gene expression in rare melanoma cell lines. In vivo treatment of mucosal and uveal melanoma xenograft models with decitabine resulted in durable upregulation of IIPS and antigen presentation genes, and whole transcriptome analysis confirmed that IIPS gene re-expression was the dominant transcriptional consequence of decitabine treatment. These findings highlight silencing of IIPS genes as a recurrent immune evasion mechanism in rare melanomas and nominate decitabine as a potential immunomodulatory strategy for enhancing immune responsiveness.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Immunohistochemistry-based assessment of estrogen receptor (ER) status, a critical step to guide use of endocrine therapy (ET) in breast cancer, is often delayed or unavailable. As a result, ET is often prescribed empirically, leading to ineffective and toxic treatment for ER-negative patients. To address this unmet need, we developed ESPWA (Estrogen Receptor Status Prediction for Haitian patients using deep learning-enabled histopathology Whole Slide Imaging Analysis), a deep-learning (DL) model that predicts ER status directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs). Methods: We curated two cohorts of H&E WSIs with tissue-matched ER status: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 1085) and Zanmi Lasante (ZL, n = 3448) from Haiti. We trained two models using weakly supervised attention-based multiple instance learning: a 'TCGA' model, trained on TCGA data, and ESPWA, trained on the ZL dataset. Model performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. Results: Performance of the 'TCGA' model was sensitive to the domain shift between the TCGA and ZL datasets, with a performance of an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.846 on the TCGA test sets and 0.671 on the ZL test sets. Compared to the 'TCGA' model, ESPWA demonstrated improved performance on the ZL cohort (AUROC=0.790; p=0.005). Subgroup analyses revealed clinically relevant populations in which ESPWA demonstrated improved performance relative to the overall cohort. Finally, ESPWA outperformed an academic breast pathologist (accuracy: 0.726 vs 0.639 respectively; p <0.001) in determining ER status from H&E WSIs. Conclusion: ESPWA ('Hope' in Haitian Creole) offers an accessible framework to identify individualized therapeutic insights from H&E WSIs in LMICs. We have initiated clinical trials, using ESPWA, in ZL and sub-Saharan African countries to inform precision-based use of ET for prospective patients.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

To better understand how parental adversity is passed on to offspring, we investigated the impact of maternal and paternal CM on the local gyrification index (LGI) of offspring using parent-offspring trio data. The LGI was selected as a key neurodevelopmental metric because it is thought to reflect the fetal environment and remain relatively stable postnatally, making it less susceptible to later life experiences. Using multiple regression, we analyzed sex-stratified associations between parental CM subtypes and the offspring LGI and tested for mediation by parental psychosocial functioning. The results revealed a distinct parent-of-origin, sex-specific pattern: maternal emotional abuse was associated with a lower LGI in male offspring, whereas paternal physical neglect was associated with a lower LGI in female offspring. These associations were not mediated by the current mental health or marital relationships of the parents.

Recent theoretical proposals have suggested that the Li isotopes may exert unique effects in the brain, stemming from quantum phenomena linked to their distinct nuclear spin properties3-5. However, aside from earlier observations of isotope-dependent variations in animal behavior6,7, direct experimental evidence is lacking. We used multi-electrode array electrophysiology to probe field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in rat brain slices and demonstrated that 6Li and 7Li have large and opposite effects on synaptic transmission and lead to smaller, but still distinct, differences in synaptic plasticity, particularly, paired-pulse facilitation and the early stages of long-term potentiation.

However, the influence of distinct tissue environments on the differentiation and clonal selection of polyclonal T cells remains unclear, primarily because of the technical challenges in tracking these cells in vivo. To address this question, we generated Tracking Recently Activated Cell Kinetics (TRACK) mice, a dual-recombinase fate-mapping system that enables precise spatial and temporal labeling of recently activated CD4+ T cells. Using TRACK mice during influenza infection, we observed organ-specific clonal selection and transcriptional differentiation in the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes (medLNs), and spleen. T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing revealed that local antigenic landscapes and clonal identity shape repertoire diversity, resulting in a low clonal overlap between tissues during acute infection. During the effector phase, spleen-derived CD4+ T cells preferentially adopted a stem-like migratory phenotype, whereas those activated in the medLNs predominantly differentiated into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Memory formation was associated with increased clonal overlap between lung and medLN-derived cells, whereas splenic clones retained a distinct repertoire. Additionally, memory CD4+ T cells displayed converging antigen specificity across tissues over time. These results highlight the tissue-dependent mechanisms driving clonal selection and functional specialization during infection and underscore how memory development facilitates clonal redistribution and functional convergence.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Influenza virus-infected heart tissue was significantly altered in mitochondrial metabolism, extracellular matrix, circadian rhythm, and immunity pathways. Particularly striking was activation of gene expression downstream of the mitochondrial biogenesis-promoting AMPK/PGC-1 axis, which occurred late in infection but failed to reverse the repression of mitochondria-associated genes, suggesting an insufficient or delayed compensatory response. Accordingly, we administered AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) early in infection and observed restoration of mitochondria-associated gene levels, amelioration of cardiac electrical dysfunction and fibrosis, and improvement in survival without overt effects on lung function. Overall, the advent of an immunocompetent model for severe influenza associated cardiac dysfunction revealed activation of AMPK signaling as a hosttargeted metabolic intervention for mitigating virus-induced heart pathologies", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Our screen identified genes that differentially affect cell proliferation in Sdhb-deficient versus normal imCCs. Notably, several subunits of the transcriptional Mediator complex emerged as potential tumor suppressors, as their loss selectively promoted growth of Sdhb-deficient cells. Most strikingly, we found that the neddylation pathway -required for ubiquitin-mediated selective protein degradation - plays a critical role in controlling cell growth and survival in Sdhb-deficient imCCs. Specifically, loss of the neddylation regulator Ube2m led to increased proliferation, while loss of Ube2f suppressed growth of Sdhb-deficient imCCs. Consequently, global neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 (Pevonedistat) and UBE2F-CRL5 axis inhibitor HA-9104 were shown to downregulate neddylation, suppressing UBE2F activity and selectively inhibiting growth of Sdhb-deficient imCCs.

Such cGELs are synthesized either by incorporation of unnatural amino acids that display mild electrophiles on their side chains or by chemical post-translational modification (cPTM) of mRNA or phage-displayed peptide libraries. Here we investigate fundamental barriers to the synthesis of cGELs. We observe that a previously reported cPTM that proceeds in neutral-to-basic conditions creates mixtures of regioisomers. The complexity of the resulting mixture scales with the electrophilicity of the warhead used in the linker, with some electrophiles being not suitable for use under basic conditions. In contrast, use of a Knorr-pyrazole cPTM enables attachment of electrophiles in acidic pH, thus preventing unwanted reactions with nucleophilic sidechains. The Electrophile is activated only upon mixture with the desired protein target in neutral pH. We use this approach to generate a cGEL with alkyne-bearing macrocycles and use it to identify covalent macrocyclic ligands for pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2). Our results suggest that construction of cGELs should be performed in conditions that silence the electrophiles (e.g., acidic environment) to prevent unwanted side reactions. In addition to the Knorr-pyrazole method, many other biocompatible bond-forming processes that proceed in mildly acidic pH are likely to be equally effective in constructing cGELs.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Understanding factors contributing to anticipatory breadth, wherein affinity maturation against an ancestral strain yields neutralization capacity against evolved variants, is therefore of great importance. Here, we investigated the mechanism of anticipatory breadth development in a public antibody family targeting the functionally restricted ACE2 binding site on SARS-CoV-2. IGHV3-53/66 antibodies isolated from memory B cells of infection-naive individuals vaccinated with the ancestral Wuhan-strain mRNA vaccine frequently neutralized evolved Omicron variants and contained several hallmark mutations previously shown to enhance neutralization breadth. Comparative analyses with antibodies from Omicron breakthrough infections revealed that breadth-associated patterns of somatic hypermutation emerged independently of variant exposure. However, Omicron infection had a marked impact on light chain pairing frequencies, suggestive of variant-imposed selection of favorable light chains. Analysis of available IGHV3-53/66 antibody structures complexed with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) clarified these findings; convergent somatic mutations on the heavy chain largely refined contacts with invariant RBD residues, while light chain pairings shifted epitopes to avoid steric challenges posed by Omicron mutations. These findings support a model of anticipatory breadth with three key elements: (1) targeting of a functionally restricted epitope, (2) affinity maturation to establish an affinity buffer, and (3) variable chain pairing to generate paratope diversity. These elements each serve to compensate for a distinct consequence of viral mutagenesis, offering a mechanistic framework for anticipating viral evolution.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

By screening 5,275 repurposable drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we identified compounds that reversed the infected cell phenotype, including ones not detected by conventional cytopathicity and antibody-based assays. A counter-screen excluded compounds whose antiviral activity was likely driven by drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL). Pathway enrichment analysis of compounds validated by both Cell Painting dose-response and DIPL assays, revealed host processes frequently hijacked by viruses, including innate immune responses and kinases. Among the top hits, both novel candidates, such as serdemetan, and previously reported broad-spectrum antivirals, such as sunitinib, were identified. Our approach constitutes an adaptable and scalable platform suited for diverse viral pathogens and cell systems. We provide a resource of open access screening data, images, and automated analysis pipelines to advance both antiviral discovery and pandemic preparedness.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

We performed a comparative genomic analysis of 12 trypanosomatid parasites together with the free-living kinetoplastid Bodo saltans as an outgroup, using the DarkHorse algorithm to identify putative HGT candidates. B. saltans encoded the largest number of HGT-derived genes (980; 5.2% of coding sequences), whereas parasitic Leishmania species retained the fewest (67-71; 0.8-0.9%), consistent with extensive gene loss accompanying the transition to parasitism. Dollo parsimony reconstruction indicated that the kinetoplastid ancestor acquired numerous horizontally transferred genes, many of which were subsequently lost, but several functionally important families were retained in trypanosomatids. Among these, we identified a bacterial-derived aspartate ammonia ligase that, together with aspartate ammonia lyase, likely supports redox balance and succinate fermentation under anaerobic conditions in the insect gut. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed bacterial or archaeal origins of multiple enzymes in ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential pathway in trypanosomatids. Functional characterization in Lotmaria passim demonstrated that sterol C-8 isomerase is indispensable, whereas sterol C-5 desaturase is nonessential in vitro but critical for parasite growth at low temperature, amphotericin B sensitivity, and successful colonization of the honey bee hindgut. These findings illustrate the dual evolutionary trajectory of HGT in kinetoplastids: extensive gene loss during the transition to parasitism, coupled with the retention of lineage-specific innovations essential for survival in host environments.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

These additional regions are compositionally biased and are predicted to be intrinsically disordered and associated with Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS). However, LLPS has only been experimentally demonstrated for Rho from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Here, we extend a prior bioinformatic analysis of Rho from mycobacterial species, where Rho has additional regions that differ from Rho in B. thetaiotaomicron. We show that Mycolicibacterium smegmatis Rho forms in vitro and in vivo condensates by LLPS, and that LLPS depends upon the additional regions. In vitro, droplet formation for Rho from four mycobacterial species was modulated by the presence of RNA and was observed for the intrinsically disordered regions alone, suggesting that these regions are sufficient for droplet formation. Moreover, Rho phase separation in living M. smegmatis cells occurs during acid stress and may impact cell fitness. This phenotype is due to Rho's additional regions, since engineered mycobacterial Rho lacking the additional regions does not undergo LLPS. In summary, our results indicate that LLPS is a widespread mechanism in which mycobacterial Rho assembles into condensates, possibly terminating the transcription of different genes, which allows tolerance to stress conditions.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

In Canada, insect vectors of this pathogen are leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), and they can contribute to significant economic losses. As climate change alters the composition and movement of insect communities, migratory species such as the potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae, Harris 1841), one of the most abundant leafhoppers in Quebec, may play an emerging role in phytoplasma diseases. Although E. fabae is not currently confirmed to act as a vector, its frequent presence and abundance in fields, along with its potential to acquire phytoplasmas, deserve further investigation. In this study, we tested DNA from E. fabae collected in strawberry fields for the presence of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma' using PCR, as well as inbred colonies for their ability to transmit this pathogen. The amplicon amplified from positive samples were cloned and sequenced to identify phytoplasma groups and subgroups. Our findings confirmed the presence of multiple Aster Yellows (16SrI-related) phytoplasma strains in E. fabae, based on phylogenetic analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiling, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles. However, the transmission assays did not show vector competence. We propose that although this leafhopper species hosts multiple, possibly new, phytoplasma subgroups, its capacity to transmit the disease remains limited and likely depends on high population density. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of monitoring common pests like E. fabae as indicators of phytoplasma diversity in Eastern Canadian agricultural systems.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

We applied targeted gene editing to investigate MSP4 and 5 function in P. falciparum, which causes most malaria mortality, and P. knowlesi, an in vitro culturable zoonotic species closely related to the widespread P. vivax. CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing revealed that P. knowlesi MSP4 was not required for parasite growth in vitro. While P. knowlesi MSP5 could be functionally replaced by P. vivax MSP5, it was refractory to gene deletion. We confirmed the opposite for two different P. falciparum laboratory isolates where MSP4 is essential but MSP5 is dispensable. Attempts to select for reliance on the non-essential MSP (e.g. P. knowlesi MSP4 or P. falciparum MSP5) through long-term growth of inducible knock-out parasites, or via chimeric complementation of the essential MSP4 or 5 with the essential MSP from the other species, were unsuccessful. Live cell filming revealed a severe cell-entry defect with conditional knock-down of MSP5 protein expression in P. knowlesi.

The severe disease outcomes are often linked to a hyperinflammatory response known as a \"cytokine storm.\" The underlying mechanisms responsible for this exaggerated immune response remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate the molecular pathways contributing to the severe inflammatory damage and mortality associated with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 hijacks host lipid metabolism, particularly the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) pathway, which leads to the production of the bioactive molecules, including the 12-Lipoxygenase (12-LOX)-derived lipid mediators in platelets, as well as in lung and vascular cells. We hypothesized that 12-LOX drives the hyperinflammatory response and disease severity, and that its inhibition could reduce inflammation and improve outcomes. Analysis of autopsy lung samples from COVID-19 decedents and SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice revealed increased 12-LOX expression. We evaluated VLX-1005, a selective small-molecule 12-LOX inhibitor, in infected mice. Treatment initiated 48 hours post-infection significantly improved survival, reduced body weight loss, and decreased lung inflammation compared to controls. Notably, male mice showed higher survival rates than females. VLX-1005 treatment also suppressed key chemokines and cytokines associated with the cytokine storm, and reduced lung damage.

Accurate visualization of biofilm structure in its native state is crucial for understanding its resilience and guiding the development of targeted therapeutics. We used three different sample preparation methods - critical-point drying (CPD), air-drying (AD), and high-pressure cryogenic freezing for the sample preparation of native biofilms grown on solid substrates and microcolonies grown within alginate matrices. Our goal was to compare their morphologies and spatial organizations using SEM and cryogenic SEM (cryo-SEM). Cryo-SEM revealed Pseudomonas biofilms as highly hydrated, organized structures, preserving delicate ECM features and cellular morphology. The ECM and cell distributions were severely distorted in CPD and air-dried samples due to dehydration. Notably, cryo-SEM revealed that mucoid P. aeruginosa grown for 4 days is spatially separated and short-range ordered in the extensive ECM with nearest-neighbor distances averaging 1.26 m, while PAO1 showed a broader distribution in nearest-neighbor distances with an average of 1.64 m, both challenging the view of biofilms as closely packed cell aggregates. Furthermore, distinct differences in cryo-SEM-visualized ECM structure were observed between PAO1 and mucoid strains. The latter formed a voluminous, filamentous matrix rich in aligned fibrillar ultrastructures, which likely derive from protein ECM components. In contrast, PAO1 displayed denser biofilms with mesh-like ECMs and higher cell densities. The cell densities of both biofilms were observed to be lowest close to the substrate. While PAO1 displays a monotonic increase in cell density from the substrate to the biofilm surface, mucoid biofilms displayed a stratified pattern, with significantly higher densities at the surface and mid-depth than near the substrate.

In this study, molecular evidence was provided for the occurrence of p53 at the subset of E2F1-driven promoters and their suppression, despite the co-occurrence of p53 with p300. P53 repressed promoters were characterized by relatively high nucleosome density and demethylation of H3K4, followed by low H3K27 acetylation and trimethylation of H3K4. Induction of the ATM/ATR-Chek1/2-p53 pathway by sub-lethal doses of cisplatin caused the release of p53 from gene promoters, chromatin relaxation and the gain of transcription permissive histone marks. Mechanistically, p53 maintained the KDM5B that is associated with gene promoters, thereby conditioning the demethylation of H3K4me3. P53 formed an immunoprecipitable complex with KDM5B, E2F1, p300 and H3K4me2 in intact cells, which decomposed with cisplatin and substantially increased the level of H3K4me3 in the p300 interactome. The extrusion of KDM5B from the chromatin was triggered by cisplatin, transient p53 silencing or KDM5B inhibition, also enabled p300 enrichment and increased gene transcription.

TET initiates the demethylation by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a chemically stable derivative that is not only an intermediate in demethylation but also an epigenetic mark. 5hmC is enriched at active gene bodies, promoters, and enhancers that exist at accessible chromatin. Yet, 75-90% of genomic DNA is physically packaged in nucleosomes, raising the question about where 5hmC resides relative to nucleosomes. To address this question, we used micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to biochemically stratify 5hmC according to nucleosome protection in naive mouse B cells. Using multiple approaches, we showed that ~95% of 5hmC peaks are retained after MNase digest, suggesting that 5hmC is nucleosome-associated. Despite the majority of 5hmC being similar in nucleosomal DNA compared to total DNA, we identified minor subsets that were MNase-sensitive (accessible 5hmC, ~3%) or further MNase-resistant (protected 5hmC, ~1-2%). Integrative analyses revealed that the accessible 5hmC is preferentially located at promoters and enhancers, and the presence of promoter-proximal accessible 5hmC showed a stronger correlation with gene expression than total 5hmC. In contrast, protected 5hmC is enriched in chromatin states with mixed active and repressive features.

Using cryo-electron microscopy, we map SLiMs in IWS1 that interact with Pol II subunits RPB1, RPB2, and RPB5, as well as elongation factors DSIF, SPT6, and ELOF1. Functional assays demonstrate that distinct IWS1 SLiMs specify IWS1 recruitment and IWS1-dependent transcription stimulation. IWS1 recruitment to the transcription elongation complex depends on association via the RPB1 jaw and binding of downstream DNA, and transcription elongation stimulation requires interactions with the RPB2 lobe and ELOF1.

HEIP1 promotes crossing over by orchestrating the recruitment of other pro-crossover proteins, including the MutS complex (MSH4-MSH5) and E3 ligases (HEI10, RNF212, and RNF212B), that are required to mature crossover sites and recruit the crossover-specific resolution complex MutL.

The engineering of photoxenases is a versatile method for the reversible photocontrol in various applications. To boost the photocontrol of an established allosteric and heterodimeric photoxenase based on imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase, we turned from an ineffective tuning of the UAA photochemistry to a semi-rational enzyme design. Remarkably, mutations at the catalytically important heterodimer interface increased the light-regulation factor (LRF) for the kcat up to ~100 with near-quantitative reversibility. Steady-state kinetic investigations combined with computationally determined correlation-based Shortest-Path-Map analysis and conformational landscapes revealed how photocontrol was altered in the two best hits. The LRF(kcat) correlated with a shift of a conformational equilibrium between an active and inactive population at the targeted active site and a tuned population productivity upon irradiation.

V.; Hu, J.; Wu, M.; Qian, J.; Inman, J. T.; Wang, M. D.; Crickard, J. B.", "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a DNA double-strand break repair pathway that facilitates genetic exchange and protects damaged replication forks during DNA synthesis. As a template-based repair process, the successful repair of a double-strand break depends on locating suitable homology from a donor DNA sequence elsewhere in the genome. In eukaryotes, Rad51 catalyzes the homology search in coordination with the ATP-dependent motor protein Rad54. The mechanism by which these two proteins regulate forces on dsDNA substrates during homology search remains unknown. Here, we have utilized single-molecule magnetic tweezers and optical trapping methods to monitor remodeling of the DNA template during the homology search. We find that the activity of Rad51 and Rad54 remodels the donor DNA substrate to control the association and dissociation of Rad51-ssDNA filaments in the absence of DNA homology. This mechanism occurs through the application of both linear (tension) and rotational (torsion) forces on the donor DNA. Finally, failure of Rad54 to act processively disrupts target selection in vivo. This study provides a basic understanding of how motorized homology search manipulates the donor DNA during the search for a suitable repair template.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

While bacterial alkane monooxygenase AlkB catalyzes the terminal hydroxylation of aliphatic esters with excellent regioselectivity, the molecular principles of substrate recognition and selectivity of this integral membrane enzyme are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the substrate scope and engineered the medium-chain alkane monooxygenase from Marinobacter sp. (M_AlkB) for the terminal hydroxylation of linear and branched esters of fatty acids and alcohols. For the first time, we demonstrated the stereoselectivity of AlkB towards prochiral substrates containing terminal gem-dimethyl groups, leading to the corresponding chiral {beta}-methyl primary alcohols in good optical purity (51-79% ee). The hydroxylation products can be further derivatized to chiral diols and lactones. Substitution of the highly conserved active site residue F169 to leucine increased the activity towards short and medium-chain esters up to two-fold. While the wildtype enzyme does not accept long-chain substrates, activity towards n-dodecyl acetate could be unlocked by reducing the size of the tryptophan residue 60 situated in the putative substrate tunnel. Substitution of the peripheral I238 with valine increased activity regardless of the chain length of the substrate. Our results lay the groundwork for the establishment of a whole-cell process for the regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of linear and branched esters, leading to valuable bifunctionalized products.

The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is a central regulator of protein homeostasis, and its dysregulation is associated with multiple cancers. Within this system, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which remove ubiquitin moieties from target proteins and thereby modulate their stability and function, have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets. Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit H (EIF3H), a JAMM family DUB, is overexpressed in multiple cancers and implicated in stabilizing oncogenic proteins. Using clinical transcriptomic datasets, we identified EIF3H as significantly upregulated in breast invasive carcinoma, with high expression correlating with poor patient outcomes. Functional assays demonstrated that EIF3H overexpression enhances proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells, whereas its knockdown suppresses these traits. Mechanistically, EIF3H physically interacts with and deubiquitinates phosphorylated ERK (pERK), preventing its degradation and sustaining MAPK pathway activation. This represents the first report of pERK as a direct EIF3H substrate, revealing a novel mechanism linking EIF3H to metastatic progression. Moreover, EIF3H deficient cells display increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of EIF3H may simultaneously impair metastasis and improve therapeutic efficacy. Collectively, our findings identify EIF3H as a potential therapeutic target for combating metastatic breast cancer.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Structure-activity relationship-guided chemical proteomics identified the eukaryotic translation termination factor 1 (ETF1) as a target of the photo-stereoprobes, and this interaction was recapitulated with recombinant purified ETF1. We found that the photo-stereoprobes modulate programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanisms essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection without causing ETF1 degradation, thus distinguishing the photo-stereoprobes from other known ETF1-directed small molecules.

An increasing number of clinical isolates shows reduced susceptibility to echinocandins and azoles, leaving amphotericin B (AMB) as a last therapeutic option. Resistance of N. glabratus to this drug is rare and its underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we describe two independent multidrug resistant (MDR) bloodstream isolates displaying resistance to AMB and anidulafungin (ANF) as well as a reduced susceptibility to azoles. Methods: Whole-genome sequencing and sterol profiling were performed on nine clinical N. glabratus isolates which were resistant to ANF and displayed resistance or low susceptibility to fluconazole (FLU) and AMB. The transcriptional response of reference strain CBS138 and an AMBR+ANFR isolate was analyzed by RNA-seq. Furthermore, PDR1 was deleted in the latter isolate to examine its influence on efflux pump gene expression. Additionally, fitness and virulence of the AMBR+ANFR isolate were examined in growth assays and a Galleria mellonella infection model. Results: Loss of function mutations in the genes ERG3 and ERG4 is linked to ergosterol depletion and AMB resistance. Ergosterol depletion also contributed to a Pdr1-mediated up-regulation of ERG and ABC transporter genes which was associated with low FLU susceptibility. The AMBR isolates displayed no fitness defects and one of them was fully virulent in a G. mellonella infection model. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ergosterol depletion in N. glabratus leads to AMB resistance without affecting fitness or virulence.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

HUVECs express high levels of TG2, and identification of its interacting partners may provide mechanistic insight into its role in endothelial functions such as adhesion, migration, angiogenesis, and NO homeostasis. For this purpose, two approaches were employed. Firstly, bacterially expressed, site-specifically biotinylated recombinant TG2 was mixed with HUVEC extract to isolate interacting partners by affinity chromatography. Secondly, endogenous TG2 was silenced, and to ensure high antibody affinity, a triple Flag-tagged transgenic TG2-expressing HUVEC line was created, allowing stable binding to anti-Flag antibody-coated agarose for isolating TG2-associated protein complexes. Altogether, 170 and 356 TG2-associated proteins were identified, respectively, with 86 proteins overlapping between the two approaches. The most enriched GO Molecular Functions of cellularly assembled TG2-interacting proteins confirm TG2's involvement in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix communication, adhesion, cytoskeleton organisation, and exosome secretion. Stabilising the catalytically inactive closed TG2 conformation reduced the number of TG2 interactors, whereas stabilising its open form increased the number of associated membrane transporters. Significant enrichment of RNA-binding proteins associated with TG2 was observed in all experiments, and a 42% overlap between the TG2 interactome and previously identified RNA-binding proteins in HUVEC was noted. Considering the recently recognised RNA-binding ability of TG2, our results suggest that TG2 participates in post-transcriptional regulations as a central hub within the network of RNA-binding proteins.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Changes in cognitive flexibility are a promising candidate mechanism underlying age-related changes in cognition, but the causes of inflexibility in older adulthood remain elusive. Here we focus on a core feature of flexible cognition: the ability to rapidly transition between different cognitive states when required to do so by changes in the environment or our goals (e.g., moving between states of low vs. high attentional focus). We put forward a dynamical systems model proposing that aging-related cognitive inflexibility arises in part from slowing of transitions between distinct configurations of cognitive control, even when the task is held constant. To test this model, we had participants across the lifespan perform a cognitive task under different performance goals, which induced different control configurations. Using computational modeling, we were able to measure dynamic changes in control configurations to meet different performance goals. This allowed us to simultaneously test three potential sources of age-related decreases in cognitive flexibility: 1) diminished control capacity in environments that require more switching; 2) diminished range of control adjustments; and 3) slower transitions between control states. Of these, we found that age was only associated with transition speed. When given sufficient time to maintain a given goal, older adults were able to adjust control to a similar extent as younger adults; however, when goals changed more frequently, they were more likely to undershoot their target control configuration for that goal, consistent with predictions from our model for longer transition times. Our findings demonstrate that cognitive dynamics, rather than the overall reductions in cognitive ability, are critical for understanding the mechanisms through which cognitive inflexibility arises in older adulthood.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

However, recombination modifies the rate at which complexity emerges, accelerating convergence to the complexity plateau in changing environments while slowing the process in static environments.

Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) is a member of the basic zipper family, a superfamily of transcription factors which operate exclusively in eukaryotes and bind DNA targets as homodimers or heterodimers. Modulation of oligomerization provides an additional opportunity for transcriptional control by this (and similar) families over monomeric transcription factors. However, when dimerization occurs, before or after target binding, is not known. We performed a suite of in vitro stopped-flow kinetic measurements, including CREB basic zippers target search amongst excess non-target DNA. The extensive dataset enabled a kinetic and thermodynamic understanding of DNA binding that demonstrated most productive search is performed by dimeric, rather than monomeric, CREB. Equilibrium is approached very rapidly under physiologically relevant concentrations, where relative flux through the monomer pathway is only around 1 in every 10,000 complexes formed. This preference of mechanism is driven by CREB monomer having a substantially higher affinity for another CREB monomer than for its DNA target. Equilibrium experiments with eight other monomeric peptides further suggest this as a common feature amongst the bZIP proteins, with only one peptide (Jun) displaying similar affinities for both.

However to date, import of gene-length RNA, required for gene integration in the mitochondrial genome, has never been described. The goal of this study was to devise and test experimental strategies to detect and improve the import of mRNA-sized RNA in mitochondria, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model. A first fluorescence-based screening approach, relying on mitochondrial import of a fluorescent protein encoding mRNA was analyzed by fluorescence measurements, western blot and mRNA-FISH. Confounding results obtained with these different techniques made it difficult to unambiguously conclude on the occurrence of import of mRNA-sized RNAs into mitochondria. An adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) approach, imposing a strong selection pressure for mRNA import to mitochondria, was then designed and tested to improve mitochondrial mRNA import. While the ALE approach did not improve mitochondrial mRNA import in the present study, it is a promising, unambiguous method for future studies testing different RNAs or mutants.

Altered DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that can influence gene expression, is well documented in AD, yet cell-type-specific investigations remain limited. In this study, we examine DNA methylation signatures associated with OLGs across multiple brain regions in AD to better understand the role of DNA methylation and OLGs in the disease, and how such changes may impact gene expression. METHODS: We performed weighted-gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) on multiple omics AD datasets across species: human DNA methylation datasets across 4 brain regions, human brain single-nuclei RNA sequencing data and mouse brain RNA sequencing data. We then investigated networks to identify disease-associated modules enriched for OLG genes, before running comparisons across such modules. RESULTS: We identified a DNA methylation signature associated with AD, enriched for OLGs, and preserved across brain regions. Genes within this signature showed altered expression in OLGs, confirming cell-type specificity and relevance to AD. Dysregulated signatures were observed across multiple disease stages, revealing a conserved pattern of OLG dysfunction from early to late stages and highlighting OLG alterations as a key feature of early AD pathogenesis. DISCUSSION: We reveal a consistent pattern of OLG dysfunction spanning early to late stages of AD, across DNA methylation and gene expression. Our findings implicate early OLG-associated DNA methylation changes as a potential initiating factor in disease pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Neuroimaging studies have sought to understand this disparity by examining sex differences, primarily through functional and structural connectivity. However, much less is known about how brain networks are organized in autism from a morphological perspective, and how this organization may help explain its sex-related characteristics. This study aimed to elucidate sex-specific alterations in morphology-based connectivity among adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: T1-weighted MRI scans from 337 individuals (181 with ASD; 162 females in total), aged 8-18 years, were preprocessed using FreeSurfer to extract five morphological features--thickness, surface area, sulcal depth, mean curvature, and gray matter volume--across 68 cortical regions. Connectivity was estimated via Kullback-Leibler divergence between region-wise multivariate feature distributions. Network-Based Statistics was applied within sex-stratified models to identify clusters of significantly altered connections in ASD relative to controls (individual edge threshold p = 0.005; FWE-corrected p = 0.05; 5,000 permutations). An exploratory post hoc analysis using partial correlations further associated identified sex-specific network profiles with behavior and comorbidity. Results: ASD males showed significantly increased connectivity in a cluster centered on the fusiform gyrus, along with the medial orbitofrontal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. This pattern was positively correlated with restricted and repetitive behaviors (r = 0.22, 95% CI [0.01, 0.41]). In females with ASD, increased connectivity was found in a sub-network implicating mainly the entorhinal cortex, followed by the inferior parietal lobule, and lateral occipital cortex. Notably, the fusiform gyrus was disrupted yet in the opposite direction, exhibiting decreased connectivity with the superior temporal sulcus. These alterations were negatively associated with communication skills (r = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.45, -0.03]). No overlap between male- and female-specific profiles was found, highlighting their distinctiveness. Limitations: Our cross-sectional sample does not allow for neurodevelopmental inference. Sex-stratified modeling precluded sex-by-diagnosis testing. Conclusions: Males and females with ASD show non-overlapping profiles of altered morphology-based connectivity, each associated with different behavioral traits, which may contribute to better characterize sex differences in autism.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Using an amber nonsense mutation, we show that the gp5.4 protein is dispensable for bacteriophage T4 particle assembly but essential for bacteriophage fitness and infection of bacteria with truncated lipopolysaccharides.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the etiology of approximately 5% of all cancers worldwide, including cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal malignancies. HPV E6 is a multifunctional oncoprotein that drives tumorigenesis and is best known for bridging the ubiquitin ligase E6AP (UBE3A) and p53 into a complex that leads to proteasome mediated destruction of p53. We developed small molecule inhibitors that covalently bind to cysteine-51 (Cys-51) in HPV16 E6. In HPV16-positive cancer cells, these compounds increase p53 protein levels and activate p53-dependent transcriptional programs associated with apoptosis and senescence, resulting in reduced tumor cell viability. In vivo, E6 inhibition suppresses the growth of human HPV16 expressing cervical and oropharyngeal tumor cell lines in mice. The strategy of targeting a viral oncoprotein with a covalent inhibitor demonstrates a genotype-specific therapeutic strategy for HPV-associated cancers and premalignant infections, addressing a significant unmet need in current treatment options.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

Offspring typically remain calm and close to the caregiver during such stimulation. Although these behaviors are thought to support emotional regulation and bonding during infancy, the underlying mechanisms and the role of prior experience remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that back stroking induces a conserved calming response in both human infants and mouse pups, characterized by reduced movement and heart rate. In mouse pups, stroking further facilitated sleep onset, increased EEG delta power, and attenuated stress-induced corticosterone elevations. These sleep-promoting and stress-buffering effects were absent in artificially reared pups deprived of postnatal maternal contact, underscoring the importance of early tactile experience. Transcriptomic analysis revealed downregulation of the voltage-gated calcium channel subunit gene Cacna1b in the hypothalamus of artificially reared pups. Moreover, knockdown of hypothalamic Cacna1b in maternally reared pups abolished stroking-induced calming and sleep-promoting effects. This study identifies a conserved, experience-dependent calming response to affiliative tactile input, biologically embedded through plasticity, that supports physiological regulation and stress resilience during early development. Our results highlight that affiliative tactile sensation, like discriminative tactile sensation, depends on early experience to organize neural mechanisms regulating internal states.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

M.; Martinez, M. X.; Rokerya, R. K.; Vera, V. A.; Ruiz, C. M.; Farrell, M. R.; Walawalkar, S. A.; Kollman, G. J.; Mahler, S. V.", "abstract": "The ventral pallidum (VP) is embedded within the brain circuits controlling motivated behavior, which are heavily implicated in addiction and other psychiatric disorders. Prior work showed that VP GABAergic neurons (VPGABA) promote reward approach and seeking, while intermixed populations of VP glutamate neurons instead promote avoidance and aversion. Some have thus suggested a functional dichotomy between these VP subpopulations in reward versus threat. We test this hypothesis by asking how inhibiting VPGABA impacts active and passive defensive responses to learned threat cues. We taught GAD1:Cre rats with inhibitory VPGABA DREADDs (or WT littermates without DREADDs) that a metal-wrapped probe delivers shock, or that a 20sec auditory cue precedes footshocks. These threats elicit active defensive burying, or passive freezing responses, respectively. We found that VPGABA inhibition markedly increased stimulus-appropriate defensive responses to both types of threats, but failed to alter new learning about threat, suggesting VPGABA mediates aversive motivation but not memory formation. VPGABA inhibition also altered threat-related c-Fos expression patterns within VP cell populations, and in their efferent target region LHb, pointing to underlying circuit mechanisms of these conditioned defensive responses. Results indicate that VPGABA neurons not only promote reward seeking as previously reported, but that they also actively inhibit defensive responses to threats that might otherwise limit reward seeking. This refines our understanding of subcortical valanced motivation circuits, and may suggest new targets for intervening in disorders like addiction and depression.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "Our perception of the world is transformed by attention, both in terms of the efficiency of information processing and the appearance of attended stimuli. A standard theory is that attention regulates how competing stimuli vie for resources. However, an alternative perspective is that attention alters the representational geometry of stimulus spaces, such that changes in processing are not isolated to the particular competing stimuli, but are reflected across the entire perceptual space. To test this representational hypothesis, we conducted an experiment in which participants reported the perceived similarity of orientations spanning the full stimulus space when attention was directed or not directed to specific orientations. We used these similarity judgments to measure the representational geometry of orientation, finding that attention reliably expanded the representational space in a narrow range around the attended orientations. We also found evidence for compression of the representational space in a broad range around unattended orientations. Our findings support the idea that attention acts to reshape the representation of entire perceptual spaces in a way that supports processing of relevant stimulus features. By simultaneously manipulating attention while measuring perceptual similarity, our methodological framework opens the door for future work investigating the interaction between cognitive and perceptual processes from the perspective of representational geometry.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Divergent Excitability of GABAergic Neurons Derived from Bipolar Disorder Patients Shapes Energy Shifts of Network Dynamics, possibly mimicking mania and depression", "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.28.672780", "authors": "Choudhary, A.; Sharma, O.; Ezer, R. B.; Tripathi, U.; Rosh, I.; Stern, T.; Birch, J. D.; Nunes, A.; Falkovich, G.; Alda, M.; Stern, S.", "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by fluctuating mood states, yet the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms distinguishing lithium-responsive (LR) from non-responsive (NR) patients remain elusive. We derived dentate gyrus granule neurons and GABAergic interneurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of BD patients stratified by lithium response, and from healthy controls. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we assessed intrinsic excitability. We further developed a computational model simulating large-scale neuronal networks based on patient-derived electrophysiological properties and ion channel conductance distributions. Granule neurons from both LR and NR patients exhibited hyperexcitability compared to controls. However, GABAergic neurons showed a striking divergence: LR neurons were hyperexcitable, while NR neurons were hypoexcitable. Transcriptomic profiling revealed distinct molecular signatures between NR and LR neurons, including dysregulation of GABA receptor genes (GABRR1). Computational simulations over 10,000 iterations, mimicking long-term network activity, revealed that dentate granule neuron changes alone failed to recapitulate network shifts between global hyperexcitability and global hypoexcitability. Networks incorporating only granule neuron phenotypes entered persistent hyper- or hypoactive states, depending on lithium response. Remarkably, when GABAergic neuron phenotypes were added to the model, both LR and NR networks exhibited spontaneous transitions between high and low activity states, that may be associated with the mood episodes that the patients exhibit. Control networks did not show such bistability. We, therefore, conclude that GABAergic neuronal excitability is a key determinant of lithium responsiveness in BD and critically shapes the emergence of state-shift dynamics in neural networks. These findings suggest that restoring excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance via targeted modulation of interneuron function may offer novel therapeutic avenues for BD.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": ""}
