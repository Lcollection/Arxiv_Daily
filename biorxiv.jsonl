Here, we combined and annotated 552 fungal genomes from the class Sordariomycetes and examined the association between 13 genomic and two lifestyle traits: pathogenicity and insect association. We found that pathogens on average tend to have a larger number of protein-coding genes, including effectors, and tRNA genes. In addition, the non-repetitive size of their genomes is larger than that of non-pathogenic species. However, this pattern is not consistent across all groups. Insect endoparasites and symbionts have smaller genome sizes and genes with longer exons; moreover, insect-vectored pathogens possess fewer genes compared to those not transmitted by insects. Our study shows that genes are the main contributors to genome size variation in Sordariomycetes and that pathogens can exhibit distinct genome architectures, depending on their host and vector interactions.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}
{"title": "The Impact of Stability Considerations on Genetic Fine-Mapping", "doi": "10.1101/2023.04.11.536456", "authors": "Aw, A.; Jin, L. C.; Ioannidis, N.; Song, Y. S.", "abstract": "Fine-mapping methods, which aim to identify genetic variants responsible for complex traits following genetic association studies, typically assume that sufficient adjustments for confounding within the association study cohort have been made, e.g., through regressing out the top principal components (i.e., residualization). Despite its widespread use, however, residualization may not completely remove all sources of confounding. Here, we propose a complementary stability-guided approach that does not rely on residualization, which identifies consistently fine-mapped variants across different genetic backgrounds or environments. Simulations show that stability guidance neither outperforms nor underperforms residualization, but each approach picks up different variants considerably often. Critically, prioritizing variants that match between the residualization and stability-guided approaches enhances recovery of causal variants. We further demonstrate the utility of the stability approach by applying it to fine-map eQTLs in the GEUVADIS data. Using 378 different functional annotations of the human genome, including recent deep learning-based annotations (e.g., Enformer), we compare enrichments of these annotations among variants for which the stability and traditional residualization-based fine-mapping approaches agree against those for which they disagree, and find that the stability approach enhances the power of traditional fine-mapping methods in identifying variants with functional impact. Finally, in cases where the two approaches report distinct variants, our approach identifies variants comparably enriched for functional annotations. Our findings suggest that the stability principle, as a conceptually simple device, complements existing approaches to fine-mapping, reinforcing recent advocacy of evaluating cross-population and cross-environment portability of biological findings.

The climate variability hypothesis (CVH) predicts that species from environments with more variable temperatures should have wider thermal tolerance breadth. This hypothesis has not yet been tested thoroughly across diverse plants. Here, we asked how local climate predictors (including precipitation, mean and extreme temperatures, and thermal variability) are associated with species physiological thermal limits. 2. Measures of lower (Tcrit-cold) and upper (Tcrit-hot) photosystem II thermal tolerance thresholds were used to determine thermal tolerance breadth (TTB), along with ice nucleation temperature (Tnucleation, freezing tolerance) of 69 plant species sampled from the field across three contrasting biomes: alpine, desert and coastal temperate rainforest. 3. All measured thermal tolerance metrics (Tcrit-cold, Tnucleation, Tcrit-hot and TTB) differed among biomes. Notably, desert species had the most cold and heat tolerant leaves, and therefore the widest TTB, whereas species in alpine and temperate biomes had similar TTB. For plants in all biomes, TTB exceeded the thermal range of their local climate. 4. Overall, two Principal Component axes of local climate drivers explained substantial variation in all tolerance metrics. Extreme hot, dry climates improved freezing and heat tolerance. High thermal variability and low minimum temperatures also improved freezing tolerance but were unrelated to heat tolerance or TTB. Species explained a significant amount of variation among all metrics, but this was not due to phylogenetic relatedness. We discuss how the remaining variation could be due to microclimate-driven plasticity, leaf traits or thermoregulatory mechanisms. 5. Synthesis. Our results provide partial support for the climate variability hypothesis in plants: photosystem thermal tolerance breadth was greatest in more thermally variable biomes. This relationship was largely driven by cold tolerance, with variation in heat tolerance explained better by mean and extreme temperatures. Therefore, we conclude that the CVH alone is not sufficient to explain variation in plant thermal tolerance, with many other aspects of climate, environment and biology being potentially important drivers.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we quantified the similarity between the maternal milk and the infant gut microbiome using 507 metagenomic samples collected from 195 mother-infant pairs at one, three, and six months postpartum. Microbial taxonomic overlap between milk and the infant gut was driven by Bifidobacterium longum, and infant microbiomes dominated by B. longum showed greater temporal stability than those dominated by other species. We identified numerous instances of strain sharing between milk and the infant gut, involving both commensal (e.g. B. longum) and pathobiont species (e.g. K. pneumoniae). Shared strains also included typically oral species such as S. salivarius and V. parvula, suggesting possible transmission from the infant's oral cavity to the mother's milk. At one month, the infant gut microbiome was enriched in biosynthetic pathways, suggesting that early colonisers might be more metabolically independent than later ones. Lastly, we observed significant overlap in antimicrobial resistance gene carriage within mother-infant pairs. Together, our results suggest that the human milk microbiome has an important role in the assembly, composition, and stability of the infant gut microbiome.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Q.", "abstract": "Animals routinely need to make decisions about what to eat and when. These decisions are influenced not only by the availability and quality of food but also by the internal state of the animal, which needs to compute and give weights to these different variables before making a choice. Feeding preferences of female mosquitoes exemplify this behavioural plasticity. Both male and female mosquitoes usually feed on carbohydrate-rich sources of nectar or sap, but the female also feeds on blood, which is essential for egg development. This blood-appetite is modulated across the female's reproductive cycle, yet little is known about the factors that bring it about. We show that mated, but not virgin Anopheles stephensi females, a major vector of urban malaria in the Indian sub-continent and West Africa, suppress blood feeding between a blood meal and oviposition. We identify several candidate genes through transcriptomics of blood-deprived and -sated An. stephensi central brains that could modulate this behaviour. We show that short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and RYamide (RYa) act together to promote blood feeding and identify a cluster of cells in the subesophageal zone that expresses sNPF transcripts only in the blood-hungry state. Such females also have more sNPF transcripts in their midguts. Based on these data, we propose a model where increased sNPF levels in the brain and gut promote a state of blood-hunger, which drives feeding behaviour either by sNPF 's action in the two tissues independently or via a communication between them. This occurs in the context of the action of RYa in the brain.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

The pathological process evolves from acute phases predominantly driven by inflammation transitioning to progressive profiles where neurodegeneration takes precedence. It remains unresolved why this course is highly heterogeneous among patients. Currently we know that sex variable plays a crucial role in its understanding. Females are 2-3 times more likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis while males' progression is faster with greater severity. We investigate the potential molecular mechanisms underlying these sex-differential clinical traits analysing transcriptomic data at single cell resolution. 48,919 central nervous system and 336,934 peripheral immune cells, covering the multiple sclerosis spectrum, enabled us to provide the comprehensive landscape of sex differences by cell type. This includes signatures in gene expression patterns, functional profiling, pathways activation and cell-cell communication networks for females, males and their sex-differential profiles. Complete results can be explored in the user-friendly interactive webtool https://bioinfo.cipf.es/cbl-atlas-ms/. Among these findings, we unveiled that female neurons may exhibit protective mechanisms against excitotoxicity, glial cells dysregulated widely stress response genes in a sex-differential manner, and female oligodendrocytes increase expression of axon-myelin contact genes suggesting strong potential for myelin recovery. In the inflammatory-predominant forms, female immune cells present an inflammatory core driven by the AP-1 transcription factor, while male adaptive immune cells exhibit higher mitochondrial impairment. Conversely, larger differences are reported in CD8+ T cells, with females displaying homeostasis recovery patterns and males exhibiting cytolytic profiles.

To understand this 150-million-year discrepancy, we compiled a new phylogenomic dataset, revised fossil evidence, derived a new dated sponge phylogeny, and tested whether ancestral sponges were aspiculated or not. We infer the last common sponge ancestor to have been early Ediacaran in age and aspiculated. Siliceous spicules evolved independently at least four times, and calcareous spicules at least two times in crown sponges. We performed a diversification rate analysis showing that siliceous spicules did not drive species radiations.

They activate MAPK activated protein kinases (MAPKAPKs) in a context dependent manner by specific phosphorylation, and together, they play crucial biological roles. One such pair is PMK3, p38-MAPK and its cognate MAPKAPK, MAK2, downstream of DLK1 (MAPK kinase kinase) and MKK4 (MAPK kinase) in C. elegans. They are implicated in axonal regeneration, degeneration and synaptic pruning in response to neuronal injury. Here, we report that PMK3 and MAK2 engage in a feedback relationship, leading to phosphorylation-mediated activation of both kinases. Interaction of PMK3 with MAK2 through the canonical docking site leads to negligible de novo autophosphorylation of PMK3. Phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr residues on the TxY-motif necessary for the full activation of PMK3 requires catalytic activity of MAK2 as confirmed by mass spectrometry. Distribution of phosphorylation sites on either kinase when incubated together, and presence of long intrinsically disordered regions in each kinase indicate that PMK3:MAK2 complex is conformationally plastic in nature. MAK2 increases bioavailability of aggregation-prone PMK3 by virtue of its ability to form LLPS-driven condensates in vitro, wherein they retain enzymatic activities and phosphorylate each other. Furthermore, experiments with transgenic C. elegans reveal that MAK2 controls stability of PMK3 and localization of PMK3 puncta in touch neuron.

It has been shown that in addition to liver inflammation, systemic inflammation also contributes to liver fibrogenesis. A deeper understanding of mechanisms that control liver fibrotic response to intra- and extra-hepatic inflammation is essential to develop novel clinical strategies against this disease. Extracellular vesicles (EV) have been recognized as immune mediators that facilitate activation of hepatic stellate cells. In inflammatory diseases, activated neutrophils release neutrophil elastase (NE) bound to EV, which has been identified as a significant contributor to inflammation by promoting immune cell activation. Here, we aimed to explore the role of inflammation derived plasma EV-associated NE in liver fibrogenesis and its potential mechanisms. We show EV-associated NE induces activation, proliferation and migration of hepatic stellate cells by promoting activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This effect did not occur through EV without surface NE, and Sivelestat, a NE inhibitor, inhibited activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway mediated by EV-associated NE. Moreover, we found plasma EV-associated NE increases deposition of collagen1 and -smooth muscle actin in the liver of a mouse model of liver fibrosis (Mdr2-/-). Notably, this effect does not occur in control mice without preexisting liver disease. These data suggest that EV-associated NE is a pro-fibrogenic factor for hepatic stellate cell activation via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in pre-existing liver injuries.

Intriguingly, these two computations were further supported by orientation-adjustment and orientation-discrimination experiments. Finally, the ablation studies in convolutional neural networks revealed that predictive coding feedback played a critical role in the center-surround inhibition in expectation.

The algorithm relies on comparisons between individual species in a single sample to estimates the sequencing efficiency at levels of GC content, and outputs unbiased species abundances. GuaCAMOLE thus works regardless of the specific amount or direction of GC-bias present in the data and does not rely on calibration experiments or multiple samples. Applying our algorithm to 3435 gut microbiomes of colorectal cancer patients from 33 individual studies reveals that the type and severity of GC bias varies considerably between studies.

In recent years, genome-wide studies have used catalogs ranging in size from fewer than 200,000 to over 7 million loci. Where these catalogs overlapped, they often disagreed on locus boundaries, hindering the comparison and reuse of results across studies. Now, with multiple groups developing public databases of TR variation in large population cohorts, there is a risk that, without sufficient consensus in the choice of locus definitions, the use of divergent repeat catalogs will lead to confusion, fragmentation, and incompatibility across future resources. In this paper, we compare existing TR catalogs and discuss desirable features of a comprehensive genome-wide catalog. We then present a new, richly annotated catalog designed for large-scale analyses and population databases. Our catalog stratifies TRs into two groups: 1) isolated TRs suitable for repeat copy number analysis using short-read or long-read data and 2) so-called variation clusters that contain TRs within wider polymorphic regions that are best studied through sequence-level analysis. To define variation clusters, we present a novel algorithm that leverages long-read HiFi sequencing data to group repeats with surrounding polymorphisms. We show that the human genome contains at least 25,000 complex variation clusters, most of which span over 120 bp and contain five or more TRs.

Using bioinformatic and lipidomic analysis, we identified a 3-gene predicted operon, renamed as gpgSDF, that is responsible for the biosynthesis and potential transport of GlcN-PG in P. aeruginosa: gpgS encodes a novel glycotransferase that is responsible for the modification of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to produce GlcNAc-PG, and gpgD encodes a novel deacetylase that removes the acetyl group from GlcNAc-PG to produce GlcN-PG. The third gene, gpgF, is predicted to encode a flippase whose activity remains to be experimentally verified. A P. aeruginosa gpgD transposon mutant accumulates GlcNAc-PG and lacks GlcN-PG, and as expected, the complementation of gpgD restores the production of GlcN-PG.

Interestingly, the primary target of spinal NA released from descending LC[-&gt;]SDH-NAergic terminals causing the stress-induced pain hypersensitivity was 1A-adrenaline receptors (1ARs) in Hes5-positive (Hes5+) astrocytes located in the SDH, an astrocyte subset that has an ability to induce pain sensitization. Furthermore, activation of Hes5+ astrocytes reduced activity of SDH-inhibitory neurons (SDH-INs) that have an inhibitory role in pain processing. This astrocytic reduction of IN activity was canceled by an A1-adenosine receptor (A1R)-knockdown in SDH-INs, and the A1R-knockdown suppressed pain hypersensitivity caused by acute restraint stress.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, particularly those caused by H5N1 and its variants, have surged since their first occurrence in 1959. The HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have notably expanded their geographical reach, affecting numerous countries, diverse avian species, and now wild and domestic mammals. Using an ecological niche modelling approach, this study aims to elucidate the environmental factors associated with the increased HPAI H5 cases since 2020, investigate potential shifts in ecological niches, and predict new areas suitable for local viral circulation. Focusing on H5N1 and H5Nx strains, we have developed ecological niche models for HPAI cases in both wild and domestic birds while considering two distinct periods: 2015-2020 and 2020-2022. Key environmental predictors include chicken and duck population density, human density, distance to water bodies, and several land cover variables. Post-2020, we observe a notable increase in the relative influence of some of these predictors, such as intensive chicken population density and cultivated vegetation. The resulting risk maps reveal notable ecological suitability for local HPAI H5 circulation in Europe, Asia, as well as North and South America, with notable expansions of the areas at risk post-2020. The spatial distribution of HPAI H5 occurrences in wild birds appears to be primarily correlated with urban areas and open water regions. Overall, global risk maps derived from our models identify regions at risk where surveillance and control measures should be prioritised. Finally, our analyses also highlight a potential shift in the diversity of wild bird species affected by HPAI outbreaks, with a higher variety of avian species, particularly sea birds, being impacted post-2020. This increased diversity could suggest that ecological shifts in HPAI H5 circulation may be accompanied by a broader range of susceptible species.

In this study, we propose a model relating corrective ground reaction forces (Fcorr) to preceding COM position (PCOM) and velocity (VCOM). We first checked the model's validity by simulating an inverted pendulum model with known intrinsic and feedback parameters, to see whether and to what extend we could effectively identify the feedback parameters. Next, we tested the model in 15 young adult volunteers in standing. Our model effectively reconstructed Fcorr in both simulations (Fcorr: 0.77~0.99) and human experimental data (Fcorr: 0.92~0.98). The effective delay in the mediolateral direction (239 +/- 20 ms) was significantly shorter than in the anteroposterior direction (271 +/- 28 ms). Additionally, position gains were significantly larger in the mediolateral compared to anteroposterior direction, with values of -1.09 +/- 0.04 and -1.03 +/- 0.02 times critical stiffness, respectively. No significant differences between the directions were found in velocity gains. Our model can be used to identify feedback control in human standing without applying external perturbations or measuring physiology activity. Although the estimated parameters represent the lumped effects of both intrinsic and feedback contributions, they remain informative of the feedback mechanism because the intrinsic impact is negligible under normal standing. Our results show that stability of upright stance in healthy young adults is achieved by position feedback gains at levels just above critical stability. The proposed model requires easily measurable inputs which may yield value in assessment of balance disorders.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Computational approaches have enabled automated analysis of complex behaviors such as aggression and courtship in Drosophila. However, existing approaches rely on rigid, rule-based algorithms and expensive hardware, limiting sensitivity to behavioral variations and accessibility. Here, we describe the Drosophila Aggression and Courtship Evaluator (DANCE), a low-cost, open-source platform that combines machine learning-based classifiers and inexpensive hardware to quantify aggression and courtship. DANCE consists of six novel behavioral classifiers trained using a supervised machine learning algorithm. DANCE classifiers address key limitations of rule-based algorithms, capturing dynamic behavioral variations more effectively. DANCE hardware is constructed using repurposed medicine blister packs and acrylic sheets, with recordings performed using smartphones, making it affordable and accessible. Benchmarking demonstrated that DANCE hardware performs comparably to sophisticated, high-cost setups. We validated DANCE in diverse contexts, including social isolation versus enrichment, which modulates aggression and courtship; RNAi-mediated downregulation of the neuropeptide Dsk; and optogenetic silencing of dopaminergic neurons, which promotes aggression. DANCE provides a cost-effective and portable solution for studying Drosophila behaviors in resource-limited settings or near natural habitats. Its accessibility and robust performance democratize behavioral neuroscience, enabling rapid screening of genes and neuronal circuits underlying complex social behaviors.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Experiments in model systems generate interpretable gene networks but, in isolation, do not establish relevance to the human condition. Statistical genetics identifies relevant association signals at the variant or gene level but lacks tools to test specific mechanistic models, as existing methods do not incorporate the topology of gene-gene interactions. We bridge these two strategies by introducing a method that competitively tests network hypotheses with rare variant associations. A hierarchical model-based association test NERINE for the first time incorporates gene network topology while remaining resilient to network inaccuracies. We demonstrate NERINEs ability to test network hypotheses derived from both canonical pathway databases and model system screens. Comprehensive database-wide search of pathway networks with NERINE uncovers compelling associations for breast cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and type II diabetes, which are undetected by single-gene tests. Testing bespoke networks from experimental screens targeting key PD pathologies: dopaminergic neuron survival and -synuclein pathobiology, NERINE highlights rare variant burden in gene modules related to autophagy, vesicle trafficking, and protein homeostasis. Genome-scale CRISPRi-screening of -synuclein toxicity modifiers in human neurons and NERINE converge on PRL, revealing an intraneuronal -synuclein/prolactin stress response that may impact resilience to PD pathologies.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

W.; Malik, A.; Smith, A.; Flemington, E.; Ludecke, R.; Lustig, A. J.", "abstract": "The formation of inverted repeats frequently initiates rearrangements associated with gene amplification. Among these rearrangements are inverted triplications (TRP/INVs) that are associated with multiple disease states in humans. We have used the filamentous fungus Aspergillus flavus as a model system to analyze spontaneous DNA rearrangements using high-depth third-generation sequencing of DNA isolated from vegetatively cultured strains. Analysis of sequence data identified a class of infrequent and transient rearrangements having structures typical of TRP/INVs. These TRP/INVs form both unprocessed and processed species and have a variably sized deletion at the junction between direct and inverted sequences. We found that TRP/INVs are enriched in heterochromatic centromeric and subtelomeric A+T-rich regions, suggesting that this process is a source of genetic instability in these domains. Consistent with this finding, A+T-rich regions contain elevated levels of direct, inverted, and perfect palindromic repeats. Inverted junctions contain palindromic sequences that are typically associated with TRP/INVs. A closer examination of the class of genomic palindromes found at inverted junctions revealed a broad distribution, with the majority lying in AT-rich centromeric sequences. The distribution of TRP/INVs in centromeric and subtelomeric domains mirrors the frequency of palindromes, indicating that palindrome abundance is likely to be a driver of TRP/INVs. A further examination of predicted pairing patterns in palindrome-like structures suggests that these structures may function as sites of DNA resolution, strand transfer, and replicative stalling. These results are consistent with a replication-based model in which palindromes, under conditions of replication stress, facilitate the formation of TRP/INV structures. These studies also represent, to our knowledge, the first characterization of spontaneous TRP/INV formation, likely to underlie the complex rearrangements associated with higher eukaryotic genomic instability and disease states.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

We identify a pair of long-range GABAergic neurons, Earmuff, that lower an option's intrinsic value and are both necessary and sufficient for shaping the flies' preferences. Further analysis reveals that expression-modifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within introns of the gene encoding the RNA-binding molecule pumilio (pum) - a known negative regulator of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV+ - exist between the two strains. These SNPs drive variation in pum expression within Earmuff, altering how each strain values the two substrates and biasing its decisions.

SC-islet organoids form normally from DEC1-ablated human pluripotent stem cells, but their insulin release capacity and glucose threshold fail to increase during in vitro culture and upon transplant. This deficit reflects downregulation of maturity-linked effectors of glucose utilization and insulin exocytosis, blunting glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, and is rescued by increasing metabolic flux.

Because experiments to collect training data are often expensive, time-consuming, and/or otherwise limited, alternatives that make good use of small amounts of data to guide protein engineering are of high potential value. One potential alternative to large-scale benchtop experiments for collecting training data is high-throughput molecular dynamics simulation; however, to date this source of data has been largely absent from the literature. Here, I introduce a new method for selecting desirable protein variants based on quantified relationships between a small number of experimentally determined labels and descriptors of their dynamic properties. These descriptors are provided by deep neural networks trained on data from molecular dynamics simulations of variants of the protein of interest. I demonstrate that this approach can obtain very highly optimized variants based on small amounts of experimental data, outperforming alternative supervised approaches to machine learning-guided directed evolution with the same amount of experimental data. Furthermore, I show that quantified dynamics-property relationships based on only a handful of experimentally labeled example sequences can be used to accurately predict the key residues that are most relevant to determining the property in question, even when that information could not have been known or predicted based on either the molecular dynamics simulations or the experimental data alone.

C.; Glasser, M. F.", "abstract": "Cortical thickness is a widely used biomarker of brain morphology and health, yet it is dependent on local cortical folding. Because gyral crowns are consistently thicker than sulcal fundi and cortical folds vary widely across individuals, these fluctuations introduce unmodeled nuisance variance that can obscure meaningful biological effects of interest. Previous global methods of folding compensation incompletely compensate for folding effects on cortical thickness. Spatial smoothing is commonly used to reduce these effects in the literature, but this markedly degrades spatial localization precision. To address these limitations, we developed a novel method for folding-compensated cortical thickness estimation that uses nonlinear local multiple regression with five folding measures to model and more completely remove folding-related variance from cortical thickness. This approach estimates what cortical thickness would have been in the absence of folding, yielding a more biologically interpretable measure of cortical architecture. We applied this new approach to data from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (HCP-YA) and Aging Human Connectome Project (HCA), demonstrating substantial reductions in intra-areal and inter-individual variability, substantially increasing standardized effect sizes of age on cortical thickness (41% increase) while preserving neurobiologically expected patterns, and avoiding the loss of spatial precision that occurs with the spatial smoothing that has traditionally been used in the literature. The method has been integrated into the HCP pipelines, facilitating its widespread use. By attenuating folding-induced variability, this technique enhances cortical thickness as a structural phenotype and may support more accurate cortical parcellation, longitudinal tracking, and biomarker discovery in brain health and disease.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

In contrast to concurrent protein structure predictions, performance on nucleic acids was generally poor, with no predictions of previously unseen natural RNA structures achieving TM-scores above 0.8. Even though automated server performance has improved, all top-performing groups were human expert predictors: Vfold, GuangzhouRNA-human, and KiharaLab. Good performance on one template-free modeling target (OLE RNA) and accurate global secondary structure prediction suggested that structural information can be extracted from multiple sequence alignments. However, 3D accuracy generally appeared to depend on the availability of closely related 3D structure templates, and predictions still did not achieve consistent recovery of pseudoknots, singlet Watson-Crick-Franklin pairs, non-canonical pairs, or tertiary motifs like A-minor interactions. For the first time, blind predictions of nucleic acid interactions with small molecules, proteins, and other nucleic acids could be assessed in CASP16.

Here, we present a new method for estimating VA that does not involve making measurements of fitness on individuals, but instead tracks changes in the genetic composition of the population. First, we show that VA can readily be expressed as a function of the genome-wide diversity/linkage disequilibrium matrix and genome-wide expected change in allele frequency due to selection.

Needed for that is a binding mechanism that enables fast composition and decomposition of tokens of information. Binding can easily be implemented in symbolic computations through parentheses and ordering of symbols. But it is a highly nontrivial operation for distributed representations, where the tokens are encoded by activity patterns in large neural networks or large language models, or more abstractly, by a high dimensional vector. Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) provide partial solutions, but are lacking the flexibility of the brain in information retrieval, e.g. retrieving the tokens from a composed representation or retrieval of a composed representation by just providing some tokens as a cue. We show that a mechanism which the brain employs for binding distributed representations, Behavioral Time Scale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP), overcomes these deficiencies. In particular, it combines binding with attractor features that make information retrieval substantially more flexible and robust. We evaluate its performance on various applications, including encoding and decoding complex visual scenes and hierarchical binding. We also show that it enhances models for natural language processing and abstract brain computation.

Builder-males were more likely to choose the demonstrated 'social' material--particularly at first choice--if they had previously used low-quality material. Using cognitive modelling, we estimated how latent learning mechanisms shaped decisions, identifying two asocial and two social parameters. These estimates provide the first formal evidence for the cognitive basis of nest building. Forward simulations informed--but not predetermined--by these parameters approximated observed behaviour, supporting their causal role. We then used these parameters in exploratory simulations to test how choices might shift under novel payoff contexts. We found that payoff structure--not (dis)satisfaction--was the primary driver of social material use, though higher rewards did not proportionally increase copying.

Temporal predictions are crucial for adaptive interaction with the environment and are typically accompanied by predictions about sensory content, yet these two types of \"what\" and \"when\" predictions are usually studied separately. Specifically, oscillatory phase-coupling (or \"entrainment\") has been proposed to align our neural sensitivity with likely moments of stimulus appearance, however these accounts ignore that predictions about when something will appear are usually accompanied by predictions about what it will be. Thus, temporal predictions may not enhance all sensory processing but rather modulate particular channels encoding predicted content. We here demonstrate oscillatory phase-coupling in vision and show how it relates to content-specific encoding. In a magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, participants observed rhythmic Gabors at 1.33 or 2 Hz with predictable orientations. They judged the timing or orientation of a delayed probe which manipulated the requirement to covertly maintain the sequence rhythm. We found sustained oscillatory phase-coupling to the entrained rhythm in motor areas specifically when participants judged stimulus timing, where its extent was associated with perceptual performance. Meanwhile, neural decoding revealed content predictions in early visual areas (\"what\") that fluctuated in line with temporal predictions (\"when\"). These temporally-specific content predictions appeared regardless of task instruction but were correlated with the degree of motor phase-coupling during timing judgements. These findings suggest that temporal predictions may be derived from motor readouts of temporally-specific sensory predictions, with broad implications for our understanding of entrainment and prediction, and how we represent time more generally.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

The only exception to this is the Nezhaarchaea, which, based on metagenomics, are predicted to be CO2-reducing methanogens. Here, we demonstrate methanogenic activity in a third class of Thermoproteota, the Methanonezhaarchaeia. We expand the metabolic diversity of this class by cultivating a methylotrophic species, Candidatus Methanonezhaarchaeum fastidiosum YNP3N. Contrary to genomic predictions, strain YNP3N is unable to grow by hydrogenotrophic CO2-reducing methanogenesis, highlighting the importance of testing metagenomic hypotheses through experimentation. Further, we describe novel genes involved in methanogenesis that are not found in other methanogens. We investigate the metabolic diversity of Methanonezhaarchaeia, including metabolic modifications accompanying frequent loss of methanogenesis in this class. This highlights gaps in our understanding of the biochemistry, diversity, and evolution of thermoproteotal methanogens and their contributions to carbon cycling.\n\nTeaserThe cultivation of a new group of methanogens illuminates their metabolic diversity and evolution of archaea.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "How does the brain integrate artificial body extensions into its somatosensory representations? Prior work shows that the body and technology are represented simultaneously, but little is known about how these representations evolve dynamically across different sensorimotor interaction phases. To fill this gap, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built exoskeletal device that extended users' fingers by 10 cm. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after exoskeleton wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task to measure representations of biological and exoskeletal fingers. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, wearing the exoskeleton led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, after active use, the represented lengths of the biological and exoskeletal fingers stretched significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a post-removal aftereffect on the biological finger representation was observed. These results demonstrate that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into body representations, with dynamic proprioceptive adjustments shaped by structural and functional properties of the device. This work advances our understanding of how the sensorimotor system accommodates artificial extensions and highlights the potential for body-augmenting technologies to be intuitively integrated within the sensorimotor system.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

This research defines how the loss of Ptpn22 (PEP-null) and PEP-R619W changes antiviral immunity during acute coronavirus infection. We address the hypothesis that CRISPR/Cas9-generated PEP-null and PEP-R619W mice have enhanced antiviral immunity over PEP-WT mice during coronavirus infection. Following Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) A59 infection, we interrogated pathology, cytokine production, and cellular responses in the blood, spleen, and liver of PEP-WT, PEP-null, and PEP-R619W mice. Key findings show that PEP-R619W mice have reduced viral titer and weight loss, increased survival, and more mature NK cells in the liver and spleen compared to PEP-WT mice. Interestingly, protection against disease in PEP-null mice was inoculation-dose-dependent, whereas PEP-R619W conferred immunity regardless of infection dose. Further, Rag1-/- PEP-R619W mice had increased survival and reduced viral titer over Rag1-/- PEP-WT mice. PEP-R619W mice also had higher concentrations of IFN{gamma} and enhanced IFN{gamma} production by mature NK cells in the liver at 3 days post-infection. Finally, NK cell depletion elevated PEP-R619W viral titer to similar levels as PEP-WT mice. This is one of the first studies investigating the role of Ptpn22 within NK cells and demonstrates that the Ptpn22 allelic variant augments NK cell function and is beneficial during coronavirus infection.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Recently, new synthetic opioids nitazene derivatives have emerged, among which isotonitazene is 50 times more potent than fentanyl. Here we used state-of-the-art molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experiments to investigate the membrane-dependent pharmacology of fentanyl, isotonitazene, morphine, and naloxone. Using the weighted-ensemble continuous constant pH MD, we estimated the effective permeability of fentanyl at pH 7.5 to be on the order of 10-7 cm/s, which is about two orders of magnitude faster than the simulation estimate for morphine. In contrast, isotonitazene and naloxone effectively do not partition into the membrane under the same conditions. The simulations captured the proton-coupled permeation processes, challenging the long-standing pH-partition hypothesis. Subsequent BRET reporter cell experiments demonstrated that cells exposed to fentanyl, but not morphine, reactivated the receptor after washout and in competition with naloxone. Immobilized affinity membrane chromatography confirmed fentanyl's high affinity for phospholipids. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that fentanyl's extreme in vivo potency may be driven by its accumulation within the plasma membrane or intracellularly, enabling it to repartition into the extracellular space to rebind the receptor, or potentially access it via a lipid-mediated route. The simulation methodology enables detailed analysis of membrane permeation by ionizable inhibitors, supporting ADME optimization in drug development.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Semi-Automated Protein Production (SAPP) is a rapid, modular, scalable and cost-effective protocol, enabling up to milligram-scale protein production, and standardized characterization including yield, dispersity, and oligomeric state of hundreds of designs per day, at the cost-equivalent of a few DNA oligos per construct. End-to-end protocol execution takes 48 hours, with about 6 hours spent benchside using mostly standard laboratory equipment. This protocol has become the standard at our institute, providing critical experimental validation for dozens of projects spanning tens of thousands of designs. Since at least 80% of SAPP's total cost comes from synthetic DNA, we also developed a scalable demultiplexing protocol (DMX) to leverage oligo pools as input DNA, providing a further 5-fold reduction in costs, enabling >1000 designs to be purified and characterized in arrayed, clonal format at a cost of $5 per construct.

While EEG responses with random temporal frequencies (m-sequences) have been studied, the underlying mechanisms that shape these responses are not fully understood. We analyze our new EEG data from a controlled experiment with m-sequence inputs and model the EEG using statistical time series models: an autoregressive (AR) model, adding exogenous input to AR (ARX), adding moving average terms (ARMAX), and finally adding a seasonality term (SARMAX). We implement computational methods to robustly handle model instabilities induced by this data, fitting these models with the Box-Jenkins methodology and assessing prediction accuracy for long periods of several seconds out-of-sample. We find in-sample fits are good in all models despite the complexities of the visual pathway, and that all models can predict aspects of EEG: including the distribution of point-wise values in time, the point-wise Pearson's correlation of EEG and model, and the frequency content. Surprisingly, we find little variation in the performance among these models, with the most sophisticated model (SARMAX) performing comparatively poorly in some instances. Our results suggest the simplest AR model is viable and can out perform more complicated models. Since these models are relatively simple and more transparent than contemporary models with numerous parameters, our study could inform future mechanistic studies of the temporal dynamics of human EEG responses to visual stimuli.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms by which a stable white matter architecture underpins individual language functions remain unclear. Previous studies have employed structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) coupling for individual fingerprinting and task decoding, suggesting that variability in brain entropy may serve as a distinguishing characteristic for language lateralisation. We examined a large cohort of healthy adults (n = 285) to investigate SC-FC coupling and identify markers distinguishing different language laterality groups. Functional connectivity was measured using resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) time-series data, while structural connectivity was determined via probabilistic fibre tractography. SC-FC coupling was investigated using the SENSAAS language atlas and defined as the Pearson correlation between non-zero elements of regional structural and functional connectivity profiles. Group differences were assessed using the PALM toolbox in FSL. Our findings revealed that increased SC-FC coupling in the left precentral sulcus was associated with typical language lateralisation, while increased coupling in the right middle temporal gyrus and left anterior insula was observed in individuals with atypical language lateralisation (pFDR < 0.05). Non-lateralised individuals exhibited increased coupling in the left anterior insula compared to lateralised (pFDR<0.05). SC-FC coupling offers a promising framework to uncover functional and anatomical differences among individuals with varying language lateralisation. This regional specificity indicates that typical, atypical, and non-lateralised profiles rely on different structural-functional alignments, likely reflecting the recruitment of alternative pathways for language processing.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

While sex chromosome aneuploidies are well-tolerated due to dedicated allelic dosage compensation mechanisms, the existence of similar regulatory processes for autosomes remains debated. Here, we investigate transcriptional responses to autosomal aneuploidies and find evidence for global dosage compensation across aneuploid chromosomes. Using high-sensitivity, allele-resolved single-cell RNA-seq on monoclonal cell expansions with varying ploidies and degrees of autosomal aneuploidy, we uncover consistent transcriptional compensation upon chromosome losses via increased burst frequency from the remaining allele. This operates in a region-specific manner across both complete and segmental aneuploidies, revealing a previously underappreciated flexibility of dosage response. Complementary proteomics analyses demonstrate additional dosage buffering at the protein level, resulting in near-stoichiometric rebalancing across autosomal aneuploid chromosomes. Analyses of cancer transcriptomes confirms that compensatory mechanisms are active in primary tumours. Our findings reveal extensive dosage compensation as a genome-wide, dynamic, response to gene product imbalance.

Although mediators such as Interleukin-6 have been implicated, how these signals impair host organ function remains incompletely defined. Here, we identify a cytokine-lipid axis that drives hepatic autophagy dysfunction. Specifically, in Drosophila, the gut tumor-derived interleukin-like cytokine Upd3 induces the expression of the triglyceride lipase CG5966, which we named cancer-associated lipid mobilizer (calm), and the ceramide synthase schlank in the fat body/liver, which rewires fat body lipid metabolism resulting in an autophagic-flux blockade. Genetic reduction of either CG5966 or schlank restores organelle homeostasis and mitigates paraneoplastic phenotypes. This mechanism is conserved in mammals: in mice, IL-6 upregulates the lipoprotein lipase Lpl and ceramide synthases which in turn trigger a hepatic autophagy-flux blockade; in humans, hepatic LPL and ceramide synthases expression correlates with poorer survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Investigating infection patterns in related host species across elevational gradients can reveal whether parasites and hosts show concordant patterns of elevational turnover, potentially due to shared historical and ecological factors. Here, we assessed patterns of elevational replacement in haemosporidian parasite assemblages that infect three congeneric songbird species: Bells Vireo (Vireo bellii), Gray Vireo (V. vicinior), and Plumbeous Vireo (V. plumbeus), each of which breeds across distinct elevations and habitats in the southwestern United States. We screened a total of 248 individuals using cytochrome b PCR and microscopy. We identified 19 haemosporidian haplotypes, including eight novel lineages. We found that each of the three vireo species exhibited high haemosporidian prevalence (55.0-86.2%), with nearly all infections from the genus Haemoproteus (subgenus Parahaemoproteus). Haemosporidian assemblages varied across elevations; each sampled range of elevations harbored abundant, yet host-specific lineages with different environmental associations. Bells and Plumbeous Vireos, but not Gray Vireos, hosted several phylogenetically distinct, putative generalist lineages, likely reflecting spillover from more diverse local breeding bird communities. Repeated infections in individuals across breeding seasons, together with moderate parasitemia ([x] {approx} 1%) suggest that these focal vireo species harbor chronic infections during their respective breeding seasons.

These models capture the connectome's topology, operationalised here as the overall distributions of network metrics (e.g., modularity, small-worldness, rich-club structure). However, they typically ignore the differential timing of connectivity formation. By omitting this temporal programme, GNMs often misplace topological features in physical space. Here, we add a heterochronous growth term to GNMs and use a new model fitness function that weighs topology and topography equally. Topography refers to the spatial embedding of the network, the actual anatomical positions of tracts. With these advances, we can generate synthetic networks that more faithfully reproduce the spatial layout of diffusion-MRI connectomes from two independent adult cohorts. Compared with classical, temporally agnostic models, heterochronous simulations improve model fit, accurately locate cortical hubs and modules, and converge on a single caudal-to-rostral gradient of brain maturation.

E.", "abstract": "The sensory and signaling roles of primary cilia rely on compartmentalization mechanisms that establish the organelle's protein and lipid composition. Septins, a family of cytoskeletal GTPases, are proposed to regulate a membrane diffusion barrier, or 'gate', at the ciliary transition zone (TZ) of mammalian cells. Here, we examine septin ciliary functions in vivo, within the sensory organs of Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of one or both nematode septin genes (unc-59, unc-61) disrupts a small subset of cilia (eg. phasmid cilia), causing short and mispositioned axonemes due to truncated dendritic processes. Interestingly, septins do not appear to function at the ciliary TZ; mutants display normal TZ gating and localisations of the MKS and NPHP module gating complexes. Furthermore, double mutant analyses reveal a lack of septin gene interaction with the MKS & NPHP module pathways. Strikingly, via cell-specific rescue experiments, we find that UNC-61 regulates phasmid neuronal cilia via cell non-autonomous mechanisms, within the glial cells that form the sensory pore. We also find that endogenous UNC-61 localises to phasmid organ-associated cell junctions, and provide evidence that septin gene loss disrupts junction integrity. Together, our data uncovers an unexpected function for glial septins in regulating a subset of sensory neuronal cilia. We propose that this cell-nonautonomous role involves septins functioning at cell junctions.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Subcutaneous administration of the adipomyokine Follistatin-like-1 (recombinant non-glycosylated human FSTL1, ngFSTL1) for two weeks, beginning one month following myocardial infarction, decreased infarct necrosis, increased blood flow, and increased cardiomyocyte proliferation within the infarct region, leading to improved systolic and diastolic function. ngFSTL-1 also enhanced coronary and peripheral vascular function by increasing BKCa channel-dependent vasodilatory capacity.

Bacteroides caccae, an accomplished mucin degrader, is a member of the human gut microbiota with sixteen genes encoding putative O-glycopeptidases in the peptidase_M60 family. At present, the diversity of substrate selective in O-glycopeptidases is not well-understood nor is the rationale behind their expansion in bacteria such as B. caccae. Here we reveal the activity and diversity of the peptidase_M60 O-glycopeptidases encoded in the B. caccae genome. At least thirteen of the sixteen peptidase_M60 genes are active mucinases. Targeted functional studies by a high-throughput FRET screen combined with detailed kinetic analyses reveal that five examples in an uncharacterized clade of peptidase_M60 proteins have different substrate selectivities despite their relatively high degree of relatedness. Structural analyses of these enzymes, including bound complexes, reveal new insight into the molecular underpinnings of O-glycopeptidase diversity. This highlights the larger context of how varied the selectivity of peptidase_M60 O-glycopeptidases can be for the glycan moiety and/or the peptide portion of the substrates, and why mucin degraders like B. caccae diversify O-glycopeptidase substrate repertoires to potentially maximize breakdown of this extraordinarily complex polymer.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Mucins separate host tissues from microbial pathogens and are instrumental for host gut health. Here, we provide evidence that mucin degradation in the gut can be mediated by mucinolysomes, defined as extracellular multi-enzyme complexes specializing in mucin degradation. We computationally predict the presence of mucinolysomes across 63 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and two isolated genomes of anaerobic Limousia bacteria, including seven MAGs from human samples of six countries. All 65 genomes were found to display core mucinolysome components, consisting of 3~6 scaffoldins (containing up to 12 cohesin modules) and up to 22 dockerin-containing mucin-degrading CAZymes (carbohydrate active enzymes). The organization of mucinolysomes allows the assembly of up to 24 CAZymes in the same complex. We validated that a cultivated Limousia strain ET540 from chicken cecum can support growth on mucins as its sole carbon source, triggering the expression of most mucinolysome-related genes, including both scaffoldins and CAZymes. We also confirmed their assembly into a multi-enzyme complex by validating the cohesin-dockerin interactions among most of the mucinolysome proteins, using AlphaFold3. While mucinolysome-encoding Limousia have low abundance in different animal hosts, their abundance and prevalence are higher in farm animals than in humans, highlighting their important role in livestock gut ecosystems.

The most bioactive fraction was subjected to acute oral toxicity testing in mice at a limit dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight, and metabolite profiling was performed using UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. PLAF exhibited the strongest ACE inhibition (IC_50 34.38 {+/-} 1.86 {micro}g/ml), prompting subsequent fractionation. Among the sub-fractions (PLAF-1A - 1E), PLAF-1D demonstrated the most potent activity (IC_50 9.70 {+/-} 0.10 {micro}g/ml). Acute toxicity evaluation of PLAF revealed no mortality, behavioral abnormalities, or significant alterations in body weight, organ weights, serum biochemical parameters (SGPT, SGOT, BUN, creatinine, LDH), or histopathological changes in the liver, kidney, and heart. These findings indicate an LD_50 greater than 2000 mg/kg.

The apparent ease with which we can tell that objects do not change colour, for example, when moving from sunlight to the shade, belies the complexity of solving this ill-constrained problem. Although there is a substantial body of work testing which image cues might be used to accomplish this, there is surprisingly little known of how the brain performs this computation. Here, we tested a fundamental aspect of this perceptual process: whether it requires attention. We measured visual search times for both surface colour (requiring separation of surface and illuminant properties) and 'raw', colorimetric colour (which does not). We found a clear difference between the two: visual search for colorimetric colour was fast and near-parallel, while search for surface colour was slow and consistent with the serial deployment of attention. That is, search times suggest that the perceptual separation of surface and illuminant properties in colour constancy may require an attention-based process analogous to perceiving conjunctions of simple features in 'feature binding'. Colour discrimination thresholds suggested that while colorimetric colour detection is fast and parallel, once attention was directed to these stimuli and perceptual scission occurs, colorimetric colour information was discarded by the visual system. These results offer important new insights into the sequence of processes the brain uses to accomplish colour constancy.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Sarcoidosis is a heterogeneous disease with unknown mechanisms, nonspecific therapies, and multiple etiologies. The role of blood extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the diagnosis and pathogenesis of sarcoidosis remains obscure. AIMS/OBJECTIVES. This study aims to test the hypothesis that the EV proteins in the blood can serve as phenotypic biomarkers of sarcoidosis. METHODS. We combined EV proteomics with machine learning algorithms to identify and prioritize biomarkers, enrich their functions, and cluster networks in case-control matched ACCESS patients. RESULTS. In total, 278 plasma EV proteins were significantly upregulated or downregulated in 40 sarcoidosis patients compared with 40 matched healthy controls. We identified 97 proteins that could serve as biomarkers with an AUC > 0.75. Of these, the AUC was > 0.90 for 13 proteins. 62 differentially expressed EV proteins strongly correlated with 20 clinical variables of severity, chest X-ray findings, and/or laboratory results. Functional annotation and network analysis suggest that these differentially expressed proteins regulate endocytosis, host responses to external stimuli, and transcription processes. Moreover, the top three ranked pathways were clathrin-mediated endocytosis, Hsp90 chaperone cycle, and spliceosome. CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates that plasma EV proteins can serve as biomarkers of various clinical phenotypes of the disease.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

For the first time, a human in vitro adipocyte cell model has an insulin response similar to in vivo human adipocytes. We next leveraged this protocol to study the early stages of insulin resistance preceding Type 2 Diabetes, by exposing these cells to diabetic patient levels of hyperinsulinemia. This resulted in mild insulin resistance on all of the aforementioned phenotypes, reminiscent of early T2D development in humans. This is a powerful model to study the mechanisms of T2D development and the underlying molecular pathology. However, while adipocytes are an important metabolic cell type, insulin resistance and T2D are a whole-body affliction, involving many other cell types. To broaden the impact of our work and increase the excitement of the field for the study of insulin signaling and resistance, we expanded our protocol to a panel of 8 other hPSC-derived cell types. We demonstrate physiologically relevant insulin response for each cell type, and we highlight that our insulin-resistance inducing conditions blunt the insulin response in every cell type. Additionally, we validate that key cell identity markers are not lost during this adaptation.

When people experience predictable disturbances while walking, they may proactively adjust their gait to minimize losses of balance. However, one's ability to effectively implement these proactive control strategies may be impaired after a stroke due to a combination of motor and cognitive impairments that result from brain lesions. Here, we used explicit audiovisual cues to characterize the proactive and reactive control strategies implemented by people with and without stroke during unexpected versus expected gait perturbations. Following unexpected treadmill accelerations, both groups had smaller margins of stability on the recovery step than during unperturbed walking. When we provided audiovisual cues specifying the impending perturbation step, people without stroke performed less leg and joint work, especially at the ankle, during the cued perturbations and increased their subsequent margins of stability by approximately 3 cm on the recovery step. However, people post-stroke did not make these proactive adjustments. Instead, after any perturbation, they modified their stepping to maintain their center of mass position within their base of support, and this reactive strategy remained unchanged with audiovisual cues. Our findings suggest that people post-stroke rely on a general reactive control strategy rather than proactively modifying push-off work, even when given precise timing information about the impending gait perturbations.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

New treatments are often developed in the context of the organ from which the tumor originates. However, there exists shared biology across glandular epithelium at the molecular level regardless of organ system, and there has been a shift towards the molecular classification of tumors. Defining and targeting pan-adenocarcinoma specific molecular features may facilitate the development of treatments applicable across adenocarcinomas, expediting drug discovery efforts and translation to the clinical setting. Methods: We performed an integrated transcriptomics analysis of adenocarcinomas originating from different organ systems. RNA sequencing expression profiles from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) with matched normal tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to discover a pan-adenocarcinoma specific transcriptomic module. A standardized DESeq2 based pipeline was used to test for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between each adenocarcinoma and its matched normal tissues, followed by cross-cancer comparisons to identify a consensus transcriptional module. Enrichment analysis was performed to reveal biological pathways associated with the consensus module, with a particular focus on those involved in oncogenesis. Prognostic significance of the consensus transcriptional module was evaluated using survival modeling, and the module was tested against in vitro transcriptomic drug perturbation signatures using Connectivity Map (cMAP) analysis to identify candidate drugs targeting adenocarcinomas, regardless of organ system of origin. Results: Despite the diversity of adenocarcinomas tested, there existed a significant and large overlap of the genes dysregulated across tested tumors. A consensus transcriptomic module was defined, and it predicted patient prognosis in each of the three adenocarcinomas. Leveraging the top shared biomarkers through cMAP analysis, we identified 36 FDA-approved drugs that are capable of reversing the shared malignant transcriptional module towards the normal state. Among the FDA-approved drugs were the EGFR and ALK inhibitors gefitinib and crizotinib, both currently used for treating LUAD, providing validation the pipeline could discover efficacious drugs. Taken together, we developed an approach for organ system independent cancer biomarkers and drug discovery, and leveraged it to identify drug candidates for expanded use in adenocarcinomas. The FDA-approved drugs identified through this pipeline serve as candidates to repurpose as pan-adenocarcinoma anti-cancer therapeutics, reducing both time and cost for drug development.

We show that transplantation of hPSC-derived ENS progenitors leads to significant increases in contractile function with formation of extensive donor-derived neuronal networks in colonic explants. Moreover, post-transplantation, we show that integration of ENS progenitors rescues many of the biological pathways impacted in the HSCR aganglionic microenvironment.

Methods: Murine models were used to lineage trace or deplete a specific sub-population of CFs at baseline and after myocardial infarction (MI). Transcriptional and epigenetic differences between fibroblast subsets were assessed using next-generation sequencing. Conservation in humans was evaluated through single-cell RNA-seq datasets and histological examination. Results: In mice, fibroblasts were the sole cardiac cell type expressing the signaling-capable isoform of the leptin receptor (LepR). LepR+ CFs emerged neonatally, occupied a defined niche in the coronary adventitia, exhibited enhanced hedgehog signaling, and responded to leptin. After MI, LepR-Cre+ CFs proliferated more than interstitial CFs, became a predominant fibroblast lineage in the scar, and their genetic ablation reduced fibrosis while improving function. LepR+ CFs were also detected in the human heart, where they were embedded in an adipocyte-rich niche. Conclusions: These findings identify adventitial fibroblasts as key drivers of pathological remodeling and demonstrate that fibroblasts, rather than cardiomyocytes, are the principal responders to leptin in the heart, redefining how this major endocrine pathway influences cardiac remodeling and disease.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular link between lipid peroxidation and iron overload in the execution of ferroptosis remains elusive. Moreover, the pathophysiological implications of the interaction between lipid peroxidation and iron overload in cardiac homeostasis and remodeling are also unknown. Methods: We assessed the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating cardiac iron overload and ferroptosis using genetic mouse models. We also performed molecular and cellular biology studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which lipid peroxidation regulates iron homeostasis and ferroptosis signaling in cardiomyocytes. Results: Cardiomyocyte-specific ablation of Gpx4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), a key suppressor of lipid peroxidation, promoted iron overload and ferroptosis in the heart, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. Mice with heterozygous Gpx4 knockout were also predisposed to adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction following pressure overload. Mechanistically, elevated lipid peroxidation due to GPX4 inactivation intrinsically induced iron overload by promoting the nuclear export of Bach1 and subsequent induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of HO-1 markedly attenuated iron overload and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes and rescued dilated cardiomyopathy associated with Gpx4 deficiency. Moreover, we identified HO-1 mitochondrial translocation as a key mechanism driving mitochondrial iron overload and ferroptosis. Targeted inhibition of mitochondrial iron overload or lipid peroxidation abrogated cardiac ferroptosis and pathological remodeling induced by Gpx4 deficiency. Conclusions: These findings identified a mechanistic link between lipid peroxidation and iron overload via the Bach1-HO-1 signaling pathway, revealing new regulators and molecular targets for cardiac ferroptosis.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

While the role of the liver in dyslipidemia is established, the contribution of adipose tissue is less clear. This study aims to clarify the role of adipose tissue in lipid metabolism and its impact on dyslipidemia development. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 125 patients from the BARIA longitudinal cohort study, consisting of patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. Comprehensive phenotyping with fasting untargeted plasma metabolomics and lipid, lipoprotein, adipokine, RNA sequencing, and fecal sample shotgun metagenomic analysis was performed. We then compared tissue transcriptomic and plasma metabolites in individuals with and without dyslipidemia, exploring protective and pathogenic mechanisms. Results: Dyslipidemia was present in 43 patients (34.4%), with elevations in triglycerides, ApoB, and reductions in HDL-C and ApoAI. Plasma adipokines were less reliable markers of dyslipidemia: leptin levels were unexpectedly reduced in dyslipidemia, and after adjusting for gender, age, and body weight, adipokines did not differ between patients with and without dyslipidemia. In relation to plasma lipids or dyslipidemia, RNA sequencing identified altered gene expression of liver, jejunum, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Adipose tissue of patients with dyslipidemia was characterized by gene alterations of 3 pathways: inflammation, oxidative stress, and adipogenesis. Untargeted plasma metabolomics revealed associations of plasma lipids with endocannabinoid-like, secondary bile acid, plasmalogen, butyrate, and sphingolipid metabolites. Gut metagenome analysis in dyslipidemia found only correlation on bacterial order level. Conclusions: This study provides novel insights into the role of adipose tissue in dyslipidemia of obesity. Our findings highlight the importance of not only visceral, but also subcutaneous adipose tissue in regulating plasma lipids.

Such an analysis could reveal the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression due to transcription misregulations, and thus could help identify therapeutic targets. Here, we systematically analyzed potential functional perturbations of TFs due to AS across 15 cancer types.

While cortical excitability fluctuations and their role in cardiac-dependent cognitive and sensorimotor phenomena have been extensively studied, the temporal dynamics and contribution of spinal excitability oscillations across the cardiac cycle remain poorly characterized. In this study, we examine whether motor evoked potentials elicited by magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord are modulated by the cardiac cycle phase in healthy participants. Real-time adapting ECG-triggered stimulation enabled precise targeting of five phases across the cardiac cycle. Spinal excitability was significantly phase-dependent, with MEPs peaking during late diastole. MEPs amplitude was also found to be modulated by preceding cardiac intervals, where shorter intervals predict stronger diastolic facilitation. These findings establish that spinal excitability is rhythmically modulated by the cardiac cycle, potentially through blood pressure-mediated mechanisms. Notably, the diastolic facilitation observed here contrasts with previously reported motor cortex excitability profiles, indicating a non-synchronous cardiac modulation of spinal versus cortical excitability. These results may benefit neuromodulation approaches for motor and psychiatric disorder treatment and emphasize the critical importance of including spinal measures in future heart-brain interaction studies.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

A major driver of its aggressiveness is the tumour microenvironment (TME), which fuels tumour growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through dynamic, bi-directional communication between cancer cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Emerging evidence highlights extracellular vesicles (EVs) as key mediators of oncogenic cross-talk within the PaC TME. This study demonstrates for the first time that the metastasis suppressor NDRG1 significantly influences the biogenesis, cargo packaging and release of EVs by cancer cells. This was mediated by a direct interaction between NDRG1 and ALIX, a key protein involved in EV biogenesis and packaging, with NDRG1 facilitating ALIX proteasomal degradation. Further, EVs released from NDRG1-overexpressing cells had significantly fewer CAF-activation proteins (i.e. TGF-{beta}), leading to attenuated ERK1/2 and p38 activation in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), and reduced expression of key fibrotic markers (-SMA, FAP, and collagen 1A). NDRG1 also reduced EV uptake by PaC cells and diverted these to the lysosome for degradation. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism by which NDRG1 disrupts the oncogenic two-way communication between PaC cells and the TME, positioning NDRG1 as a compelling therapeutic target against this formidable malignancy.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

In 2014, missense mutations in the gene encoding elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4) were identified as the causative gene for SCA34. ELOVL4, which is involved in the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, ELOVL4 is highly expressed in the cerebellum compared to other brain regions, with predominant expression in neurons. We attempted to establish a mouse model of SCA34 by expressing mutant ELOVL4 in cerebellar neurons using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and to elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Expression of W246G mutant ELOVL4 successfully induced progressive motor dysfunction beginning at two weeks post-AAV vector injection. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells and neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) paralleled the observed motor decline. Importantly, microglial activation was detected in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortices and the DCN prior to the onset of both neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction. Furthermore, after the onset of motor symptoms, the SCA34 model mice exhibited decreased synaptic inputs from climbing fibers to Purkinje cells, as well as reduce inputs from Purkinje cells to DCN neurons. These findings suggest that early microglial activation and the resulting synaptic disturbance are critical preceding events that lead to the progressive cerebellar neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction observed in this SCA34 mouse model.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Standard methods ignore this multiplicity and examine each connection independently; these studies have often shown considerable inter-individual variability and modest effects (1). Here, we take a different strategy, determining how a whole-brain connection pattern differs from the typical pattern, that is, how idiosyncratic the pattern is. We examined how the idiosyncrasy of whole brain connection patterns varies with frequency of the use of that part of cortex for attention-demanding tasks, focusing on central versus peripheral vision in healthy individuals (where individuals use central vision more frequently for attention-demanding tasks). We found that the whole-brain pattern of functional connections to the cortical representations of central vision is idiosyncratic, whereas patterns of connections to representations of peripheral vision were very similar person-to-person. In a second set of analyses, we examined the brains of people with central vision loss who use a portion of peripheral vision (called the preferred retinal locus) more frequently for attention-demanding tasks in their daily lives. The cortical representation of the preferred retinal locus exhibits more idiosyncratic connections, compared to a control brain region, or compared to the same brain region in matched control participants with healthy vision. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased attentive use of a brain area results in idiosyncratic patterns of whole brain connections.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "The flexible deployment of cognitive control is essential for adaptive functioning in dynamic environments given limited cognitive resources. That flexibility depends on rapid detection and resolution of control-prediction errors (CPEs) when current demands diverge from the control plan. Deficits in control and control flexibility are common in psychiatric disorders, yet targeted interventions are limited by incomplete circuit-level understanding and limited means for modulating control circuits . We analyzed two intracranial electroencephalography datasets (one with brief internal capsule stimulation, ICS) to identify a human neurocomputational mechanism for CPE resolution and to test its modifiability. A third dataset of patients receiving internal capsule deep brain stimulation (IC DBS) assessed clinical relevance of modifying CPE-related processes. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) anchored to the {theta} phase of right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC-R), especially {theta}- coupling between rACC-R and nodes of the cognitive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC; dorsal ACC, dACC), was associated with faster CPE resolution. An adaptive drift-diffusion model indicated that ICS improves control flexibility specifically under high CPE, and mediation analyses showed that this behavioral improvement is mediated by CPE-dependent increases in rACC-R {theta}-centered PAC. In a psychiatric cohort (N=14; primarily treatment-resistant depression, TRD) with IC DBS, enhanced control flexibility, rather than CPE-independent general cognitive control, was strongly associated with clinical response (AUC = 0.90), suggesting both a behavioral flexibility index and rACC-R PAC as candidate biomarkers for DBS optimization. These findings identify a rACC-centered, {theta} phase-based coordination of the cognitive control network as a neurocomputational substrate of flexible control. They demonstrate that capsule stimulation selectively augments this substrate when flexibility is required, and establish flexibility, rather than general control, as the feature that tracks therapeutic benefit in TRD.

Across three sequential button-press experiments, we tested how effector homology - anatomical similarity between fingers - and temporal delays between actions shape these effects. Specifically, we examined whether a priming action altered the reaction time (RT) of a subsequent action. Compared with unimanual RTs, we indexed slowing of the RT from the second action as interference, and quickening as facilitation. Priming with homologous actions (e.g., index finger-index finger) produced interference at short intervals ([&le;] 200ms) but transitioned to facilitation at longer intervals ([&ge;] 400ms). Priming with non-homologous actions (e.g., little finger-index finger) also produced interference at short intervals, but never resulted in facilitation. Critically, these patterns emerged whether the priming actions were performed with the opposite or the same hand, indicating that interference and facilitation do not depend on interhemispheric dynamics. Our results reveal a previously undocumented time-dependent shift from interference to facilitation that is specific to homologous actions, challenging models that explain the interference between parallel actions solely by competitive interhemispheric dynamics or central bottleneck processes. We propose that facilitation and interference flexibly coexist, and are shaped by effector homology and timing.

Here, we comprehensively investigate PG recycling in the alphaproteobacterial model organism Caulobacter crescentus. We show that this species contains a functional PG recycling pathway by characterizing the activities of key enzymes in vitro and in vivo. Our results reveal that PG recycling is critical for C. crescentus cell morphology and division, and is dynamically regulated to balance the flux of metabolic intermediates toward PG biosynthesis and central carbon metabolism. Importantly, defects in PG recycling strongly impair the intrinsic ampicillin resistance of C. crescentus without changing the activity of its {beta}-lactamase BlaA, likely by limiting PG precursor biosynthesis and thereby decreasing the activity of the cell wall biosynthetic machinery in the presence of residual antibiotic.

In recent years, unexplained outbreaks characterized by marked egg-production decline have occurred in breeder duck flocks in China. To identify the causative agent, samples were collected from affected farms in multiple regions across China between 2022 and 2025. Representative samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, followed by phylogenetic analysis, transmission electron microscopy, host cell infection assays, and animal challenge experiments. A previously unreported Orbivirus, designated Duck orbivirus (DORV), was identified. Epidemiological investigation indicated that outbreaks mainly affected breeder ducks during the peak laying period (21-55 weeks of age), with higher incidence in summer and autumn. The DORV genome contains ten double-stranded RNA segments encoding seven structural and five nonstructural proteins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that DORV is closely related to Parry's Lagoon virus (PLV) and Corriparta virus (CORV). Electron microscopy revealed icosahedral particles 30-40 nm in diameter. DORV replicated efficiently in DEF, DEL, and C6/36 cells but not in MDCK and LMH cells, suggesting a restricted host range with potential arthropod-borne features. Infection of breeder ducks with DORV-SD01 reduced egg production by 30-40% and caused lesions in the ovary, liver, and spleen.

Anti-virulence approaches targeting quorum sensing (QS) pathways offer a promising alternative by disarming pathogenicity, potentially without exerting selective pressure for resistance. In this study, we report the identification of two novel thiazole-indole hybrid compounds, namely 2-[(6-methoxy-1H-indol-2-yl)methyl]-5-cyano-1,3-thiazol-3-amine (designated C3) and 3-amino-5-cyano-2-(5-chloro-1H-indol-2-yl) thiazole (designated C4), as potent inhibitors of the S. aureus accessory gene regulator (agr) quorum sensing system. Building on two heterocyclic scaffolds commonly used in medicinal chemistry and associated with QS modulation, these synthetic small molecules act on the S. aureus AgrC QS receptor, attenuating virulence without affecting bacterial viability. Both compounds significantly reduced the production of secreted virulence factors without promoting biofilm formation, a known drawback of some other QS inhibitors. Furthermore, their activity extended to Staphylococcus lugdunensis, while sparing the commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis, indicating pathogen-selective QS interference. These findings establish novel thiazole-indole hybrids as a promising chemotype for anti-virulence intervention and provide valuable chemical tools for probing agr-mediated regulation in Staphylococcus species.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Despite theoretical expectations for perfect mimicry, imperfect mimicry, where the mimic only partially resembles its model, is widespread in nature. To understand how imperfect mimicry can persist ecologically, we studied the effect of different predator recognition processes on the dynamics and stability of various mimicry systems. Specifically, we extended a community dynamical model that integrates optimal foraging and signal detection theories by introducing a novel abundance-dependent recognition mechanism, where predators' perception of mimic--model similarity is influenced by the relative abundance of prey types. We demonstrate that intermediate mimic--model similarity promotes stable community dynamics and increases mimic abundance in single Batesian mimicry systems. Moreover, abundance-dependent recognition leads predators to reduce attack on mimics with low morphological similarity, further contributing to system stability. Extending the framework to a multi-mimicry system, we find that Batesian and Mullerian mimics have contrasting effects: intermediate Batesian similarity continues to stabilize the system, while high Mullerian similarity provides additional protection and can offset destabilization caused by highly similar Batesian mimics. Our study offers a novel explanation for the prevalence of imperfect mimicry in nature and highlights how recognition processes shape the ecological stability of mimicry systems.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Facing geographical barriers, migrants display various patterns considered to be adaptive. For example, they may detour along either side around the barrier or cross it, requiring specialized behavioral adaptations. Variations within closely related taxa are excellent sources for understanding the evolutionary background of migration and how barriers are shaping migration routes. In Asia, some species are assumed to have a migratory divide in response to the major geographical barrier, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), including the stonechat taxa (Siberian Stonechat Saxicola maurus maurus and Amur Stonechat S. stejnegeri). As they detour along either side of the QTP, these taxa are believed to disfavor a crossing over the highland. However, the more southernly distributed Tibetan Stonechat (S. m. przewalskii) breeds on the QTP, suggesting adaptation to high elevation. To investigate migration patterns and the potentially associated genetic differences, we studied migration routes and population genetics of four populations around the assumed migratory divide in Russia and Mongolia, and of one from the QTP in China. Our results confirmed the existence of a migratory divide between maurus and stejnegeri, albeit with extensive hybridization. We observed both the hypothesized western and eastern routes, but also found individuals employing intermediate routes crossing the QTP, of which two-thirds were clear hybrids. Meanwhile, przewalskii followed a highland-crossing route and was genetically differentiated from maurus and stejnegeri. The diverse migration routes among Asian stonechats show differential responses towards the geographical barrier. The intermediate route may be associated with hybridization, and its conditional viability may facilitate gene flow between maurus and stejnegeri. The Asian stonechat complex thus offers great opportunities for novel research of the genetics and evolution of migration. The specific evolutionary background associated with inhabiting and crossing the QTP can offer new perspectives in this field.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Currently, there is a lack of efficient tools and methods capable of directly modifying terminal N-acetylglucosamine on living cells. In this study, we identified a novel {beta}-N-acetylhexosaminidase from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, which demonstrated favorable enzymatic stability within a pH range of 5-8 and at temperatures from 4 to 37. This enzyme specifically cleaves non-reducing terminal {beta}-1,2-N-acetylglucosamine, enabling direct removal of this modification from oligosaccharides and native glycoproteins. More importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that this enzyme successfully removes {beta}-1,2-linked N-acetylglucosamine on living cell surfaces. Given its microbial origin and potential utility in living cell glycan editing, we have named it emNag or cell-surface glycan-editing N-acetylglucosaminidase (csgeNag).

Here, we report that in addition to archaeal schizorhodopsins, many members of the family originate from bacteria and detail a comprehensive biophysical characterization of novel schizorhodopsins from Antarctic Minisyncoccota (Patescibacteria) and cyanobacteria, designated as paSzR and psSzR, respectively.

Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in the third and sixth transmembrane helices demonstrates differential structural requirements between paSzR and psSzR.

How this crossover between hormone and oncogene-driven signalling pathways regulates tumour glyco-immune checkpoints remains unclear. Here, we show that O-glycans are the major substrates for sialylation in prostate cancer and that sialyltransferases that have preferences for O-glycans are differentially regulated by androgens.

Both transcription factors converge to repress ST3GAL1, thereby limiting the generation of Siglec-7 ligands. These findings highlight a context-dependent, cooperative relationship between the AR and MYC in shaping the tumour sialome, linking hormonal signalling and oncogenic transcription to Siglec biology.

Dynamic [18F]FDG-PET imaging showed a six-fold increase in myocardial glucose uptake after pressure overload in control mice, but not in cardiomyocyte-specific Camk2d/Camk2g double knockouts (cDKO), even before functional decline. cDKO hearts retained lipid reserves, indicating preserved fatty acid metabolism. Transcriptomics revealed strong CAMK2-dependent induction of Nr4a1 and early repression of genes for fatty acid uptake and beta-oxidation preceding upregulation of genes for glucose utilization. Cardiomyocyte-specific Nr4a1 knockout mice closely mimicked the metabolic protection seen in cDKO, while NR4A1 overexpression in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes suppressed fatty acid metabolism. NR4A1 directly bound and repressed the FATP1 (Slc27a1) promoter, thereby secondarily enhancing glucose utilization.

Here, we generated a 1.45-billion-contact Micro-C map of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that resolves ~4,600 loops, seven times more than previous Hi-C data. Loop anchors segregate into two epigenetic classes: 1) promoter-centered loops with anchors enriched for RNA polymerase II, accessible chromatin, active histone modifications, and 2) loops with anchors enriched for Polycomb-linked or heterochromatic signatures. Both classes strongly repel young Gypsy retrotransposons, while retaining older copies directly at the anchor, revealing an age-selective filter. Unlike mammalian genome organization, loop anchors rarely overlap insulation boundaries, indicating that loop and domain formation are largely independent. Cross-species Micro-C in two wild tomatoes shows conserved anchor positions despite rapid sequence turnover. Integrating cross-species transcriptomics further reveals a dual regulatory role for promoter-anchored loops: they can enhance expression when paired with activating chromatin or poise/repress it via H3K27me3-rich, distal anchors.

However, its unknown sexual life cycle has limited its utility in studies of evolution and genetics. Inspired by the recent discovery of sexual reproduction in the cyanidiophycean genus Galdieria, we identified similar life cycles in the other cyanidiophycean genera Cyanidioschyzon, Cyanidiococcus, and Cyanidium. In these genera, the cell-walled diploid form, exclusively observed in nature, produces a cell-wall-less haploid form when the culture pH is lowered, and both proliferate asexually. In addition, the cell-wall-less Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D strain has been shown to be a haploid clone that forms a cell-walled diploid through mating with other haploid clones. Building on these findings, we generated high-quality genomic resources with phase-specific transcriptomes and developed genetic manipulation systems using the cell-wall-less haploids of these genera. We further uncovered phase-specific distribution of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation linked to haploid- and diploid-specific gene expression, including transcription factors involved in differentiation associated with sexual reproduction in plants. Additionally, biparental inheritance of organelle DNA occurs following isogamous mating of haploid cells but resolves into uniparental inheritance during diploid proliferation.

We consider a collection of all monotone Boolean function models compatible with a given GRN, and ask which steady states are supported by most models. We find that for networks with no negative loops, there is an explicit hierarchy in the prevalence of individual steady states, as well as the prevalence of bistability and multistability. The key insight that we use is that monotone Boolean models supporting a given equilibrium are a product of prime ideals and prime filters of the lattices of monotone Boolean functions.

In rats given hydralazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), we quantified Fos protein during an early phase (60 min) and a late phase (120 min). Early after hypotension, Fos surged in a discrete subpopulation of the parabrachial Kolliker - Fuse (KF) region and in the EA, whereas magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (SON/PVN) remained largely silent.

This idea has been challenged by reports of ongoing neural activity in the alpha band during WM maintenance, however. The precise role of these alpha oscillations is unclear: Do they reflect attentional prioritization of stored information, or do they serve as a general maintenance mechanism, for instance to periodically refresh synaptic traces? To address this, we designed a visual WM task involving two memory items, one of which was prioritized for recall. The task included both a short (1 s) and a long (3 s) delay intervals between encoding and retrieval. The long delay was implemented to provide a more decisive test of WM maintenance, providing a point in time when any initially silent synaptic traces would likely need to be refreshed as well. Time-resolved decoding analyses revealed that both prioritized and deprioritized items were initially decodable following stimulus presentation. However, only the prioritized item exhibited sustained decodability throughout the delay, particularly in the long delay condition, where it transitioned into a stable coding scheme. This prolonged representation was selectively supported by induced alpha power, which reliably tracked the prioritized item, but not the deprioritized one. Impulse-based decoding further confirmed this asymmetry, highlighting a selective reactivation of the deprioritized item only upon contextual relevance. Together, these findings suggest that sustained alpha-band activity reflects attentional prioritization, rather than general memory maintenance. Unattended, non-prioritized items appear to transition into an activity-silent state, consistent with models of synaptic storage in WM.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

A recent review by Perea-Garcia and colleagues (2025) questioned four central premises of these hypotheses: (1) that human eye morphology is unique among primates, (2) that it is expressed consistently across individuals and populations, (3) that it improves gaze-following, and (4) that it is linked to the evolution of social cognition. Here, we revisit each claim through reevaluation of evidence and reanalysis of published data. First, we show that although some primates exhibit scleral depigmentation, humans uniquely combine this with high scleral exposure, resulting in markedly greater gaze visibility. Second, despite variation in scleral brightness, cross-species comparisons of sclera-iris-skin contrast confirm that human eyes remain distinct from those of other closely related apes. Third, experimental studies demonstrate that the white sclera confers a clear communicative advantage under ecologically relevant conditions, and that only humans consistently exploit these cues. Finally, developmental, cross-cultural, and neurocognitive evidence indicates that humans possess dedicated perceptual mechanisms for eye-gaze, consistent with its evolutionary embedding in social cognition. We conclude that while claims of human uniqueness should be moderated, the CEH and GSH remain the most plausible explanations for the evolution of human eye morphology. We also highlight key directions for future behavioral, anatomical, and genetic research.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

While sequence-based methods have resolved much of lifes diversity, deep evolutionary relationships often remain elusive, particularly across the three superkingdoms of life. Here, we present a complementary approach using genome-wide occurrence of protein domain combinations as phylogenetic signal. We analyzed 5,343 complete proteomes spanning Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota, and inferred a pan-genomic ToL from ~77,000 domain combinations, including isolated domains and domain pairs. Our reconstruction recovers major clades and captures both vertical inheritance and signals from non-vertical processes such as lateral gene transfer, endosymbiosis, and genome reduction. Ancestral reconstructions reveal functional innovations that mark key evolutionary transitions--such as the emergence of vesicle trafficking in Eukaryota or methanogenesis in Archaea. We found that organisms with reduced genomes, like Chlamydiota, tend to be misplaced in domain combination-based phylogenies due to sparse combinatorial data. Our results demonstrate that domain combinations carry a strong, evolutionary signal that is both biologically and functionally informative. While not a substitute for sequence-based phylogenetics, domain combination-based trees offer an alternative perspective, capable of integrating both vertical and lateral processes into a unified evolutionary framework.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Although transplanting germline stem cells (GSCs) or gonadal primordia into immunodeficient zebrafish have shown to be an important technique which can bypass the juvenile phase and expedite gamete generation, it remains challenging to raise the immunodeficient fish. Here, we achieved in vivo induction of Tregs by overexpressing the key transcription factor Foxp3a, generating transgenic zebrafish with robust immune tolerance. This was characterized by a significant downregulation of T cell development and homing-related genes, accompanied by a marked upregulation of immunosuppressive factors. Using these immune-tolerant fish as hosts for subcutaneous gonadal primordium transplantation (SGPT) and intraperitoneal GSC transplantation (IGCT), we markedly accelerated germ cell maturation and efficiently established stable transgenic lines. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that transgenic hosts demonstrated a phenotypic profile characterized by delayed immune activation, attenuated responsiveness, and enhanced graft survival. Thus, we present a Treg-induction-based approach in fish that resolves the intrinsic conflict between high embryonic transgenesis efficiency and early lethality, while significantly improving overall transgenesis success rates. Moreover, it offers a practical alternative to immunodeficient recipients, avoiding the challenges of complex husbandry and compromised fertility.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

In this study, we develop aligned collagen-GAG (CG) scaffolds using directional freeze-drying and systematically vary GAG content by incorporating GAGs of increasing sulfation levels (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and heparin). While all scaffold variants support myoblast adhesion, metabolic activity, and myotube alignment, heparin-modified collagen scaffolds significantly enhance myoblast metabolic activity and myogenic differentiation as measured by myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression and myotube size. We additionally show that heparin-modified scaffolds sequester and retain significantly higher levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a potent promoter of myogenesis, compared to other scaffold groups. Together, these results highlight the importance of optimizing GAG content in CG scaffolds for targeted applications and underscore the promise of heparin-modified CG scaffolds as a material platform for skeletal muscle tissue engineering.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

DCSE learns latent signatures for drugs, drug pairs, and side effects to predict the probability that a side effect occurs in a given drug combination. We first evaluate its performance in the commonly adopted experimental settings in the literature. Then, a key contribution of this paper is the introduction of more realistic experimental settings that incorporate warm-start and cold-start scenarios under a prospective evaluation.

Through its structural and transcriptional functions, beta-catenin is a key factor that acts on both aspects to promote liver tumorigenesis, leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. However, the mechanisms by which these two functions regulate downstream targets remain poorly understood. Herein, we describe Rnd3, also called RhoE, an atypical member of the Rho GTPase family, as a common target of both functions of beta-catenin. We previously demonstrated that RND3 expression is downregulated in HCC, which correlates with intrahepatic metastasis. Yet, a molecular understanding of how Rnd3 expression is dysregulated in cancer is largely missing. Using human HCC samples and cultured cell lines, we demonstrate that Rnd3 expression is regulated by beta-catenin pathways, regardless of their mutational status. Both the transcriptional and the structural activity of beta-catenin repress the expression of RND3. Indeed, we found that wild-type beta-catenin suppresses RND3 transcription through the Hippo pathway, whereas oncogenic beta-catenin downregulates RND3 expression through miRNA targeting its 3UTR. Rnd3 may constitute a key protein involved in the transcriptional program driven by oncogenic beta-catenin in HCC and as a mediator of the mechanosensitive response associated with cell-cell adhesion.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

In 15-20% of familial ALS cases, mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene are the underlying cause. Targeting human SOD1 (hSOD1) toxicity has emerged as a promising approach to treat SOD1-ALS. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of an exon-skipping strategy using a self-complementary AAVrh10-U7-hSOD1 vector in SOD1G93A mice achieving significant hSOD1 silencing. In this study, we optimized the therapeutic protocol by conducting a dose-finding and biodistribution study of scAAVrh10-U7-hSOD1 following a single intracerebroventricular injection in adult SOD1G93A mice. Our findings demonstrate a dose-dependent reduction in mutant hSOD1 levels in the cortex, spinal cord, and peripheral tissues, sustained for up to 60 days post-injection. In vivo, some adverse effects were noted mostly at the highest dose, with inflammation early post-injection and persistent microglial activation in the brain observed around the injection site. Importantly, the medium-dose treatment extended mean survival by up to 27% with a much milder early toxicity, which will provide a great possibility for future applications. Additionally, no major off-target effects were observed in human cell models, highlighting the targeting specificity of this approach and the potential safety for translation.

However, existing TEM implementations rely on rate-based units and simplified architectures, which limit their biological plausibility. Here, we introduce the Spiking Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine (Spiking TEM)--a spiking neural network model that extends the original TEM with spike-based computation and an anatomically inspired hippocampal-entorhinal architecture. Our model learns grid-like codes in the entorhinal module and context-specific place codes in the hippocampal module, while also exhibiting key temporal coding phenomena observed in electrophysiological recordings, including phase locking of spikes to theta oscillations and phase precession. Furthermore, the model gives rise to predictive grid cells in layer III of the entorhinal cortex, which prospectively encode upcoming spatial positions.

Top-down predictions have been shown to alter the encoding of sensory information, from early to late stages of processing. Yet, how such predictions shape neural representations in sensory cortices remains debated. Competing accounts suggest that predictions either sharpen neural representations by enhancing selectivity or dampen activity by broadly suppressing stimulus-driven responses. In a preregistered fMRI study, we tested whether these effects depend on the level of attentional engagement and explicit knowledge of predictive associations. Using a multisensory fMRI paradigm with concurrent but independent visual and auditory probabilistic associations (75% validity) and manipulated attention, we investigated predictive effects in human early visual cortex. Consistent with prior work, expected visual stimuli elicited reduced BOLD activity. Critically, sharpening of expected visual stimuli occurred exclusively when visual inputs were attended and the concurrently presented auditory inputs expected. In addition, the magnitude of the sharpening of visual representations correlated positively with participants' explicit knowledge of the visuo-predictive associations. These findings highlight the key roles of attention and explicit knowledge in promoting predictive sharpening and underscore the need to study predictive processing in more ecologically valid, multisensory contexts.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Interestingly, KPT-330 conferred transient lung protection at 24 h post infection by blocking the nuclear export of I{kappa}B, suppressing NF{kappa}B signaling and immune cell recruitment. Meanwhile, KPT-330 induced apoptosis of lung epithelial cells, enhancing bacterial adhesions and invasion, and leading to dramatically increased bacterial load.

Adjunctive therapy with the antibiotic polymyxin E (colistin) rescued survival, whereas the immunosuppressant dexamethasone did not, underscoring that timely bacterial clearance is critical for managing this adverse effect.

G.; Chang, S.; Tan, K.-C.; Turo, C. J.; Oliver, R. P.; Lopez-Ruiz, F. J.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fungicide resistance is a major concern both in agriculture and clinical disease control. Whilst several mechanisms of resistance have been elucidated, assigning phenotype to genotype is often difficult and reliant on correlations. Resistance to demethylase inhibitor (DMI) fungicides was recently reported in the economically important filamentous fungal barley (Hordeum vulgare) pathogen Pyrenophora teres f. teres (Ptt) in Australia. The target of DMI fungicides is encoded by the Cyp51 gene family; single allele of Cyp51B and two copies of the Cyp51A gene1. Five Cyp51A alleles (W1-A1, 9193-A1, KO103-A1, W1-A2 and 9193-A2) were identified in Ptt with KO103-A1 containing the mutation F489L (F495L) which correlates with resistance to various DMIs.1 RESULTS: We replaced the coding region of the native Cyp51B gene of the filamentous fungal Dothideomycete wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum with each of the five Ptt Cyp51A alleles to compare the phenotypic effects of each allele in isolation. The native Cyp51B of P. nodorum could be functionally replaced by Cyp51-A1 but not Cyp51-A2. Transformants carrying KO103-A1 exhibited significantly higher gene expression than 9193-A1 and W1-A1, suggesting the mechanism of gene regulation lies within the coding sequence and is conserved between Ptt and P. nodorum. The EC50 values of the KO103-A1 transformants were significantly higher than any other transformants or wild type isolates for metconazole, prochloraz and tebuconazole but lower for epoxiconazole. CONCLUSION: This system permits the functional characterisation of fungicide target genes in an isogenic background that mimics the physiological environment of plant pathogens. We suggest the system will prove useful in dissecting the impact of genetic mutations on a spectrum of fungicides and permit the design of fungal strains for screening active ingredients that may control strains resistant to existing fungicides.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Lactobacillus johnsonii exhibited robust gastrointestinal resilience, tolerating strong acidity and bile salts (0.3%), and showed enhanced adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cells. Across in vitro assays, live Lactobacillus johnsonii inhibited pathogen growth in agar overlay assays more strongly than gentamicin, disrupted biofilms, and displaced adherent enteropathogenic Escherichia coli from epithelial surfaces. In antibiotic-treated mice, oral Lactobacillus johnsonii reduced Citrobacter rodentium burdens in feces, colon, cecum, and spleen by approximately three to four log10 units, mitigated colon shortening, and alleviated histopathological damage, including edema, lymphocyte infiltration, and ulceration. Mechanistic studies revealed complementary modes of action: nutrient competition that reduced pathogen growth by more than fifty percent, and contact-independent killing mediated by secreted, low-molecular-weight factors. Fractionation of cell-free supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography yielded fractions smaller than seventy-five kilodaltons with potent bactericidal activity; one fraction retained activity for six hours and inhibited enteropathogenic Escherichia coli at 30?{micro}g per mL. Untargeted metabolomic profiling of active fractions identified distinct antimicrobial metabolites, including quinine hydrochloride, aloperine, and gamma-glutamylglutamine, alongside chemical classes such as fatty acyls, hydroxy acid derivatives, and carboxylic acids consistent with membrane-disruptive activity.

Results: 5 clinical isolates were multidrug resistance, exhibiting high level resistance to first-line drugs including carbapenems and ceftazidime/avibactam. Globally, KPC-2-NDM-1 (50.3%) were the most common and an increasing trend of ST11-KL64 (20%) isolates carrying iucA and rmpA/A2.

Methods: Winter wheat plants were treated with a ten-strain PGPR consortium, with or without Fusarium oxysporum and F. graminearum. Expression of five PR-gene families was quantified in roots and shoots at 7 and 14 days post-treatment via RT-qPCR. Morphometric parameters were tracked for 28 days. Results: The consortium elicited a potent defense response. In roots at 7 days, PR-1 and PR-6 expression surged 16-fold and 38-fold, respectively. Defense activation in shoots was delayed, peaking at 14 days. After 28 days, PGPR-treated plants exhibited an 8% increase in shoot length. Discussion: The results confirm that the bacterial strains effectively prime the wheat immune system, modulating early defense pathways and enhancing plant growth.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Recessive lethal mutations are widespread across studied species, with estimates suggesting that each individual carries at least one. Numerous lethal alleles persist in wild populations at higher frequencies than expected given their extreme deleterious nature. Though these findings spurred historical debate whether classical balancing selection maintains some lethal alleles at elevated frequencies (versus mutation-selection balance acting alone), we propose the question remained unanswered, especially given that the genetic basis of most naturally occurring lethal effects is still unknown. Given current genome-wide point mutation rate estimates, mutation-selection balance alone cannot explain some of this lethal variation in nature. However, evolutionary biologists have historically studied genetic variation through a lens of single nucleotide variants, when in fact the spectrum of mutational changes is far broader than point mutations alone, including indels, structural variants, short tandem repeats, and transposable element insertions. We uncover the genetic basis of lethality in nature and provide insight on the possible evolutionary forces allowing some to persist at higher frequencies. By locating hundreds of recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster via complementation testing, fine-mapping, and sequencing a subset, we determine candidate lethal mutations in specific genes. We discover that many lethal disruptions are caused by transposable element insertions, potentially suggesting a higher mutation rate more compatible with mutation-selection balance. The most common transposable element in our data is estimated to have recently invaded D. melanogaster (between 2013-2016). This finding demonstrates that the many lethal alleles studied in D. melanogaster in the last century had a distinct genetic basis. Hence, we propose a model that could explain lethal variation in natural populations of D. melanogaster: lethal mutation frequencies are driven by invasions of new transposable elements and as time passes after each invasion, those frequencies decline as D. melanogaster evolves suppression mechanisms, allowing for natural selection to more efficiently remove lethal insertions. Upon the invasion of a new TE, the cycle repeats. The ubiquity of lethal alleles in natural populations is a classic conundrum for evolutionary geneticists for over a century, and this study utilized modern tools and sequencing technology to provide novel insight into this age-old mystery.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Maternal age and diet can influence offspring development and fitness via maternal effects, but how these two factors interact remains poorly understood. We examined how maternal age at oviposition and dietary conditions affect offspring developmental plasticity in a thelytokous predatory mite (Amblyseius herbicolus). Mothers were provided either a restricted or abundant prey diet, and their offspring were exposed to varying prey availability and monitored for hatching success, survival to adulthood, developmental time, size at maturity, and prey consumption. We addressed two main questions: How does maternal age affect offspring developmental time and size at maturity and does maternal diet modify the effect of maternal age on offspring? Our results suggest an inverse Lansing effect. Offspring of older mothers showed increased survival and reduced prey consumption without any compromise in terms of size at maturity. Interactions were found between maternal diet and age on offspring prey consumption and developmental plasticity. Notably, offspring from older, diet-restricted mothers achieved the best overall performance during development. Our study demonstrates that maternal age and diet jointly shape offspring development, and highlights the importance of incorporating maternal age into studies of maternal effects and phenotypic plasticity.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Traditional cgMLST distance calculations treat all allelic differences as equivalent units, potentially obscuring nucleotide-level variation critical for source attribution. While SNP-based methods provide enhanced resolution, their computational requirements limit routine deployment in surveillance laboratories. We present cgDist, an algorithm that bridges this resolution gap by calculating nucleotide-level distances directly from cgMLST allelic profiles. The unified cache architecture stores comprehensive alignment statistics, enabling multiple distance calculation modes without redundant computation and supporting both dataset-specific and schema-complete cache generation. This design transforms genomic surveillance from batch processing to continuous streaming analysis, with cumulative performance benefits as laboratories accumulate alignment data. cgDist functions optimally as a precision \"zoom lens\" for the detailed investigation of clusters identified through initial cgMLST screening. Rather than restructuring entire population relationships, this targeted approach maximizes epidemiological insight precisely where enhanced resolution is most valuable. The algorithm ensures that cgDist distances are always greater than or equal to corresponding cgMLST distances, preserving epidemiological interpretability while adding critical genetic discrimination. The system includes integrated recombination detection capabilities that leverage cached alignment statistics to identify potential horizontal gene transfer events through mutation density analysis. This multi-scale analytical framework - from population screening through cluster zoom analysis to recombination detection - provides comprehensive surveillance capabilities within the computational constraints of routine public health practice.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

However, whether Na+ influx plays a direct role in triggering Ca2+ release has remained unclear. We previously discovered that action potential (AP) phase 0 triggered Ca2+ release while phase 2 regulated the decay phase during the Ca2+ transient (CT). We hypothesized that CICR might only exist under experimental conditions, not during physiological AP cycles. Methods: Simultaneous recordings of ion currents and CT from the same rat left ventricular cardiomyocyte were employed to investigate the temporal relationship between cation influxes and CT. Results: The reactivation time for CT was approximately 250 ms. AP phase 0 triggered the CT, while phase 2 only regulated CT width. Pulses from -40 to +80 mV with 6 ms duration were applied to validate whether the reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) could trigger CT. Pulses of -40 and -30 mV with 6 ms duration induced giant Na+ influx and tail current, but only Na+ influx triggered CT, not tail current. Pulses from -20 mV to +80 mV with 6 ms duration triggered CT via tail current, not via reduced Na+ influx. In Ca2+ free solution, Na+ influx was still able to trigger CT until sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content was remarkably reduced. Moreover, increased reverse NCX current induced by ramp-like depolarizing pulses did not trigger CT but widened its shape. Additionally, when SR function was destroyed by caffeine (20 mM/L), field stimulations caused progressively elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels, indicating that SR has a buffering function for maintaining cytosolic Ca2 concentration. Conclusions: Once Na+ influx triggers CT, Ca2+ influx cannot trigger a second CT during an AP cycle due to the limitation imposed by the reactivation time. Na+ influx might enter SR via an unknown channel or transporter at the terminal cisternae during the AP and induce Ca2+ release by acting on the SR luminal-facing site of the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) channel and/or by increasing the positive potential gradient across the SR membrane.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Twenty-five male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups: a healthy control, a negative control, and three treatment groups receiving A. moluccanus oil at doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mL/200 g BW (equivalent to 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mL/kg BW, respectively). All groups except the healthy control were administered aspirin (600 mg/kg) to induce gastric lesions, followed by 28 days of treatment. Histopathological analysis revealed dose-dependent improvements in mucosal integrity and reduced inflammatory infiltration, with the highest dose group showing near-normal histological features. Although not all intergroup differences reached statistical significance, the consistent histological trend suggests a biologically meaningful protective effect.

A.; Devaiah, M.; Chao, J.; van Veen, H.; Theodoulou, F. L.; Sasidharan, R.", "abstract": "While the molecular mechanisms mediating submergence tolerance have been extensively studied, those underpinning age-dependent resilience remain poorly characterized. In Arabidopsis thaliana, submergence elicits a leaf-age dependent phenotype in which senescence and death progress across an age gradient starting with older leaves. Here we sought to investigate the mechanisms mediating this observed differential flood resilience by interrogating leaf age-specific transcriptome and proteome changes during submergence and recovery. Following submergence, most age-dependent differences were in the magnitude or speed of transcript abundance changes, whereas qualitative leaf-age dependent responses were most apparent during recovery. This included a strong desiccation response in old leaves despite a stronger ABA-signaling response. Physiological measurements suggested that faster dehydration was facilitated by a combination of submergence-mediated reduction of ABA sensitivity and higher conductance in old leaves. We also observed a stronger induction in young shoot tissue of genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Mutants disabled in the two UPR signaling branches were affected in new leaf formation and the ability to restore the proteome, but not in senescence, suggesting that young tissues activate ER stress recovery to permit continuation of growth. Of the mitochondrial membrane proteins differentially regulated in young leaves, loss of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel function impacted submergence-recovery tolerance. Our data reveal multiple mechanisms underlying leaf age-dependent differential submergence recovery and demonstrate how tolerance is determined by an interplay between age related developmental traits and stress signaling pathways.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

KBAs are identified through quantitative criteria, among which the most recent is Criterion E. KBA Criterion E uses Spatial Conservation Prioritization techniques to identify highly irreplaceable sites, representing a promising tool for effective expansion of the KBA network. However, it has rarely been tested or applied at large scales. Here, we carried out a continental application of KBA Criterion E in Europe, using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for 5,529 species of insects and 972 tetrapods. We stress-tested the application of Criterion E by changing the following settings: irreplaceability threshold, metrics of irreplaceability, representation targets, spatial resolution, and cost of planning units. Under the standard Criterion E settings, we identified 23 potential KBAs for insects, mostly along northern European coasts, and 88 for tetrapods, mostly concentrated in Mediterranean islands and southern Europe. These sites slightly overlapped with existing KBAs, showing that Criterion E can capture biodiversity patterns overlooked by other criteria. Our results also showed that the identification of highly irreplaceable areas is very sensitive to analytical choices. The strict irreplaceability threshold currently required, associated with the definition of representation targets, limited the selection of important sites almost exclusively to those containing very narrow-range species, and when such species were absent, important sites were preferentially selected on coasts, where the cost of planning units (represented by land extent) was minimized. Our analysis showed both opportunities and challenges of Criterion E and its applications with SDMs. We propose potential adjustments to the definition and guidelines of Criterion E, to improve its applicability at large spatial scales and on different taxa. Improvements of KBA Criterion E will ensure that KBAs continue to substantially contribute to the global conservation of biodiversity.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we discover an activity-dependent upregulation of TREK1 in AD transgenic mice (3xTg and APP/PS1) and cultured hippocampal/cortical neurons, triggered by amyloid-beta 42 oligomers -induced hyperactivity. Mechanistically, we show that increased intracellular calcium activates adenylate cyclase 1/8 (AC1/8), initiating a cAMP-PKA signalling cascade that enhances the expression of chromatin regulator CTCF. This increased CTCF in turn enhances the expression of TREK1 both in vitro and in AD transgenic mice. Using calcium imaging, patch clamp electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry assays, we demonstrate that the upregulation of TREK1 serves as a critical brake on neuronal hyperexcitability and is essential for restoring synaptic balance and mitigating AD pathology.

To identify immune correlates associated with protection, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of lung immune cells after aerosol Mtb infection of naive mice and mice with contained Mtb infection (CoMtb), a model of naturally acquired resistance, across multiple time points, mouse strains, and Mtb strains. Across conditions, protection was associated with distinct temporal patterns of immune activation, cell recruitment, and resolution. Early after challenge, CoMtb mice exhibited rapid, transient recruitment and activation of CD4+ T cells, macrophages, NK, and NKT cells, accompanied by short-lived bursts of type I and II interferon signaling, increased oxidative phosphorylation, and enhanced chemokine-mediated cell-cell communication. In contrast, primary infection elicited delayed but sustained interferon and neutrophil responses and higher bacterial burdens. These data indicate that protection involves dynamically coordinated immune pathways rather than the magnitude of any single response. Transcriptional features of CoMtb overlapped with those observed in nonhuman primates following intravenous BCG vaccination, including enrichment of activated tissue-resident CD4+ T cells and innate effector populations. Together, these findings support a model in which effective immunity to Mtb depends on the timing and coordination of immune activation, providing a framework for vaccine strategies that reproduce protective lung immune dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate how bacterial microbiome composition affects pathogenesis of enteric RNA viruses. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum supplementation increased bacterial microbiome diversity without altering total bacterial load, while Acetobacter pomorum supplementation had minimal impact on the bacterial microbiome. L. plantarum-enriched flies exhibited an additional ~15% reduction in lifespan from Drosophila A virus (DAV) infection despite showing reduced viral protein accumulation and similar viral RNA levels. The reduction in tolerance to viral infection required live bacteria and was observed only for DAV, as no change in mortality was observed with Nora virus or Drosophila C virus infections. Mechanistic investigations revealed that tolerance reduction occurs independently of transcriptional immune responses, as DAV-infected flies showed similar transcriptional profiles regardless of bacterial microbiome composition. Intestinal barrier function assays demonstrated that L. plantarum-supplemented flies died before developing signs of gut barrier disruption, suggesting that extra-intestinal mechanisms contribute to mortality; this interpretation is further supported by similar levels of intestinal damage markers observed in virus-infected flies under both microbiome conditions. Viral genomic sequencing ruled out microbiome-driven selection of more pathogenic viral variants, as no adaptive mutations were observed between microbiome conditions that could account for the differential pathogenesis.

We observe that loss of afu-182 leads to azole recalcitrant biofilms and poor treated disease outcomes in murine invasive pulmonary aspergillosis models. In contrast, overexpression of afu-182 significantly reduces fungal burden in animals treated with azole drugs. Whole transcriptome analyses revealed that azole drug treatment leads to an increase in transcripts of genes encoding 7-transmembrane domain proteins of the RTA1 family, and these proteins are negatively regulated by afu-182. Two RTA1 family genes downstream of afu-182 regulation have individual and combined effect in regulating fungal ARC.

To overcome this limitation, we engineered doxycycline-inducible lentiviral constructs to drive expression of transcription factors that control lineage specification, including KLF4, POU2F3, SPIB, NEUROG3, and NEUROG3 T2A NKX6-3. Transduction of human colonoids with these constructs revealed that transient KLF4 induction is sufficient to generate TFF3 and WFDC2 expressing goblet cells. Unexpectedly KLF4 also induced GUCA2A positive colonocytes. In contrast, SPIB and POU2F3 were not sufficient to specify M-cells or mature tuft cells respectively, suggesting the requirement for additional permissive cues. Notably, co-expression of NEUROG3 and NKX6-3 induced enteroendocrine subtypes characteristic of the duodenum. These findings establish a set of lentiviral tools for induction of specific epithelial lineages in human colonoids providing a platform for replenishing cell types that are lost or altered in intestinal diseases.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Promoting land uses with low anthropogenic disturbances helps maintain the function of these ecosystems as soil carbon (C) sinks. However, the tipping points along a disturbance gradient where land use transitions generate the largest SOC losses or gains remain unclear, though they are key for effective land use management and climate change mitigation. Because flood events can negatively impact labile C, determining the main origin of stable SOC, whether from plants or soil microorganisms, is also important to identify the optimal combination of land use, vegetation, and soil type for SOC stabilization in floodplains. We examined how SOC storage and stabilization vary in the floodplain of Lake Saint-Pierre, Quebec, Canada along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient of six land uses: conventional and improved croplands, temporary and permanent meadows, marshes, and forested swamps. In all 6 land uses, we quantified SOC stocks, mineral-associated organic matter - C (MAOM-C), particulate organic matter - C (POM-C), soil {delta}13C and sugars. Land use effects on SOC storage and stabilization were most pronounced in the topsoil (0-10 cm), with forested swamps showing the highest vegetation biomass, SOC, and MAOM-C. Microbe-derived inputs were more abundant in MAOM, whereas plant-derived C dominated POM. SOC gains increased with decreasing disturbance, with a tipping point occurring in the transition from temporary to permanent meadows. Our results highlight the importance of conserving permanent and low-disturbance land uses to promote SOC persistence in floodplain ecosystems and emphasize the central role of microbial metabolism in stabilization processes.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

F.; Wollrab, S.", "abstract": "In temperate lakes plankton dynamics are closely linked to seasonal shifts in water stratification, following air temperature. The onset of summer stratification typically coincides with spring bloom formation of algae in the well mixed surface layer (epilimnion). However, extended stratification periods lead to nutrient depletion and increases the risk of algae to sink out of the sunlit epilimnion. Planktonic primary producers have evolved different traits to counteract sinking, such as specific morphological shapes, but also adaptive mechanisms like active buoyancy regulation. The latter is very common for cyanobacteria and gives them a competitive advantage over sinking taxa specifically during extended stratified periods. Existing conceptual models on plankton phenology neglect the vertical dimension of plankton bloom formation, focusing mainly on epilimnion blooms. This limits projections of how changes in stratification through global warming will affect plankton composition, productivity, and water quality. Here we develop a theoretical framework to investigate resource competition between a passively sinking (S) and a buoyancy-regulating (BR) phytoplankton species along a one-dimensional water column. The BR species adaptively moves towards optimal light and nutrient availability along the water column. Our results indicate that coexistence between BR and S algae is critically dependent on differences in resource-use efficiencies, which can lead to situations of competitive exclusion but also coexistence in overlapping or vertically separated depths. Our results highlight the importance of vertical movement strategies in structuring phytoplankton communities and its consideration for projections on plankton phenology, composition and lake primary production under changing stratification regimes.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

The Oncocyclus irises of the Southern Levant represent a young radiation of narrowly endemic species considered to be in the course of speciation. In this study, we used RAD-sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis across nine described species to investigate patterns of genomic divergence, gene flow, and local adaptation. Phylogenomic analyses revealed a mix of well-supported clades for some species, previously defined by their morphology and distribution, and non-monophyletic lineages, with several species exhibiting shallow divergence and shared genetic ancestry. We found evidence for gene flow and historical introgression between Iris petrana, I. atrofusca and I. mariae, while other cases of non-monophyly appear driven by incomplete lineage sorting. Both geographic distance (IBD) and environmental factors (IBE), mainly altitude, temperature, and aridity, were significantly associated with genetic structure, suggesting that local adaptation contributed to divergence following range expansion. Based on our findings, we propose that the divergence of the Oncocyclus iris species in the Southern Levant supports a stepping-stone dispersion model, in which north-to-south dispersal was followed by local adaptation, and introgression in secondary contact zones. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of speciation and the need for integrative approaches to study the interplay between historical divergence, contemporary gene flow, and environmental differentiation in shaping genomic patterns.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Aquaculture breeding programs rely heavily on small fractions of selected breeders to yield large production stocks, given the high fecundity typically observed in these species. In Sweden, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is a salmonid with notable commercial potential, with a selective breeding program operating for ten generations under a growth-rate focused breeding goal. Despite significant gains, the nucleus faces challenges with low and fluctuating fertility impeding expansion efforts. In this study, we estimate genetic parameters for charr milt quality phenotypes measured with specialized cytometry and Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA). At the same time, we assess the sex-specific architecture governing egg count and sperm concentration along body size. Finally, we propose a novel analytical framework for the analysis of realized fertilization success rates by considering a multiplicative system of latent maternal and paternal contributions. Low to moderate heritability estimates and genetic correlations were obtained from multi-trait modelling for traits reflecting sperm quality along with high estimates for fork length. Genetic correlations among sperm kinematic parameters appeared strong, while the same traits showed weak positive and weak negative correlations with sperm concentration and fork length, respectively. Furthermore, a negative genetic correlation between sperm concentration and both male body size and egg count suggests a complex interplay of a possible trade-off and sexual antagonism. Our latent fertility analytical approach returned low to moderate heritability estimates depending on the modelling configuration.

Here, we experimentally separated the effects of male-male competition and female mate choice in the pygmy halfbeak Dermogenys colletei, a small freshwater fish, to test whether i) male social dominance drives access to females in the presence and absence of direct male-male competition, and ii) females prefer socially dominant males. Our results show that dominant males monopolized access to females, spending more time courting females and engaging in more courtship behaviors. Additionally, female halfbeaks did not show a preference for dominant males, providing no evidence that females use male dominance when assessing males. Overall, these findings highlight that when male-male competition facilitates mate monopolization there may be less scope for pre-copulatory female mate choice.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we disentangled the effects of aggregation and heterogeneity, both arising from group living, on the exploration-vigilance trade-off in Drosophila. Using 78 genetically distinct strains from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, we compared behavioral responses of single individuals, homogeneous groups (six individuals from the same strain), and heterogeneous groups (three individuals from each of two distinct strains) under predator-like looming stimuli. Pareto optimization analysis revealed that aggregation increased both exploratory and vigilance behavior, thereby exposing the underlying exploration-vigilance trade-off. In contrast, heterogeneity enhanced group performance beyond expected levels, alleviating the cost of balancing exploration and vigilance. To identify the phenotypic basis of this alleviation, we developed a phenome-wide higher-level association study (PheHAS) that screened 190 phenotypes across strain pairs. We found that heterogeneity in activity patterns and morphological traits promoted trade-off alleviation, whereas similarity in infection responses also contributed, suggesting that social facilitation may contribute.

However, this approach lacks the spatial resolution required to capture local cell- and tissue-scale mechanical stresses. In this study, we established a non-destructive optical method for continuous micro- and macro-scale contractile force measurements. We utilized our previously developed edge-labeled micro-spherical stress gauges (eMSGs) to map the stresses within a heart-on-a-chip. These ultrasoft mechanosensors visibly deform in response to stresses generated by cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The chip consisted of two cell-seeding chambers, each containing flexible silicone pillar pairs to support tissue formation and compaction. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CMs) were encapsulated in a fibrin/Geltrex hydrogel mixture containing eMSGs and seeded into each chamber. Over time, the tissue compacted and began beating spontaneously, demonstrating structural alignment and functional cardiac hallmarks, such as calcium transients and tissue-scale beating. The effects of ECM composition on tissue function were examined, revealing that lower fibrin concentrations significantly enhanced contractile frequency, regularity, and stress generation. Local cell- and ECM-scale mechanics were further investigated by analyzing the shape changes of the dispersible sensors. Lateral and longitudinal stresses were calculated for each sensor, highlighting the critical role of tissue compaction and contraction in cell-generated forces.

Conventional treatments often yield limited success and inconsistent outcomes, especially in complex and recurring wounds. Combinatorial strategies that integrate biomaterial scaffolds with gene delivery offer a promising approach to promote tissue repair. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), particularly miRNA-155, have emerged as crucial regulators of wound healing. MiRNA-155 is highly expressed in inflammatory conditions and plays a key role in macrophage activation, polarisation, and nerve regeneration. In this context, this study introduces a miRNA-155 inhibitor-activated scaffold designed to modulate the chronic wound environment by inhibiting miRNA-155. MiRNA-155 inhibitor complexed GET nanoparticles were characterised and incorporated into collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffolds. These supported dermal fibroblast and endothelial cell growth while enabling controlled inhibitor release. Scaffold-mediated miRNA-155 inhibition in both non-polarised (M0) and pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages promoted anti-inflammatory (M2) polarisation. Macrophage secretome analysis showed reduced inflammatory cytokines and increased angiogenic growth factor secretion in both conditions. The regenerative potential of the miRNA-i-activated scaffold via macrophage polarisation was validated through inflammatory and angiogenic functional assays with endothelial cells. In parallel, scaffold-mediated miRNA-155 delivery to dorsal root ganglia (DRG) promoted neurogenic outcomes through enhanced axonal regrowth, essential for the synergistic repair of chronic wounds across the skin-nerve axis. In vivo implantation of miRNA-155 inhibitor-activated scaffolds in chicks demonstrated successful integration without disrupting vascular network formation.

In concentrated solutions of GDNA constructs, the stability of terminal base pairs and the base stacking interactions between neighboring duplexes are critical for the formation of a bilayer smectic phase. By using temperature-resolved synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, we quantified the impact of single LNA modification of terminal base pairs on the thermal stability of smectic LC phases. We observe that LNA-DNA terminal AT base pairing (A+T) increases the stability of the bilayer smectic phase by ~9-18 {degrees}C relative to DNA-DNA pairing at the same duplex concentrations. While relatively large, this increase is still significantly less than the up to ~30 {degrees}C increase observed when AT DNA-DNA pairs are replaced by GC pairs, suggesting the stacking interactions between A+T LNA-DNA base pairs are significantly weaker than those between unmodified GC base pairs.

Remarkably, the ferredoxin uptake system (Fus) of Pectobacteriaceae, a group of soft rot-inducing plant pathogens, imports an entire folded host protein into the periplasm and extracts its bound iron for growth. The inner membrane protein FusB, a TonB homologue, plays two roles in facilitating ferredoxin import. First, like other TonBs, it remodels the globular plug domain obstructing the lumen of the OM receptor FusA to allow ferredoxin passage. Unusually for a TonB protein, FusB then interacts directly with the FusA-bound ferredoxin substrate to facilitate its transport into the periplasm. In this work, we describe structures of FusB-ferredoxin and homodimeric FusB complexes and determine the key features of the binding interfaces formed by FusB with FusA and ferredoxin. We postulate that under resting conditions FusB exists a homodimer, stabilised by an intermolecular R241-D322 salt bridge. The homodimer dissociates when the \"FusB-box\" of FusA outcompetes one protomer, and FusA D53 displaces FusB D322. Upon ferredoxin binding, FusB undergoes a structural rearrangement, expanding its {beta}-sheet from three to four strands. In agreement with the proposed sequence of events, ferredoxin binding displaces the receptor (FusA) from FusB with Arg241 forming an intramolecular salt bridge with Asp322 to stabilise the newly formed {beta}-hairpin of FusB. We propose a mechanistic model for ferredoxin import in which FusB Arg241 acts as a molecular switch, and two distinct regions function as interaction hotspots.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Relapsed AML remains largely unresponsive to current therapies and carries a poor prognosis. We developed a large-language model (LLM) agent that incorporates multi-modal data to nominate druggable therapeutic targets for AML. We identified that higher expression of AGTR2 (encoding AT2R) is associated with better chemotherapy response and longer survival. In functional studies of 68 primary human AML samples, we found that LSCs consistently lacked AT2R expression. Across both CD34-expressing and -non-expressing AML samples, AT2R expression positively correlated with CD34 and CD117 expression. In patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models using 21 primary AML samples, AT2R- cells initiated leukemia, whereas AT2R+ cells failed to do so. AT2R- cells gave rise to both AT2R+ and AT2R- progeny, suggesting hierarchical differentiation. Following chemotherapy in AML PDX mice, bone marrow analysis showed a marked enrichment of AT2R- cells and depletion of AT2R+ cells, indicating that AT2R- cells drive minimal residual disease and relapse. These results support the role of AT2R absence as a marker of LSCs. We observed reduced AT2R expression in AML cells compared to healthy peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Whole-genome sequencing of AML patients revealed no functional mutations in AGTR2. However, 3D chromatin and epigenetic analyses uncovered frequent chromatin rearrangements involving AGTR2 promoter-silencer interactions, indicating epigenetic silencing as a likely mechanism for AT2R downregulation in AML. To validate the tumor suppressor role of AT2R, we developed murine AML models driven by MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a fusions with either Agtr2 knockdown or enforced expression. Agtr2 knockdown accelerated leukemogenesis, while enforced Agtr2 expression delayed AML progression. In these models, enforced Agtr2 expression reduced LSC frequency, impaired cell cycle progression, and decreased AML stemness, as confirmed by limiting dilution assays and analysis of LSC-enriched populations. Mechanistically, enforced Agtr2 expression suppressed fatty acid metabolism - a key driver of AML stemness and growth - and inhibited downstream signaling pathways, including GSK3, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/b-catenin. This led to reduced SREBF1 activity, confirmed by protein level changes and CUT&Tag assays. We tested buloxibutid (C21), a small-molecule AT2R agonist currently in phase II trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in AML PDX models derived from 20 de novo and 6 relapsed AML samples.

Here, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that enables hypothesis-agnostic, context-aware discovery of biomarkers directly from mIF images. Our approach extracts rich feature representations that capture holistic architectural patterns, which integrate cellular morphology, marker interactions, and microenvironmental context without human supervision. Applying this framework to over 7,000 mIF tissue images from over 1,800 patients in two distinct cancer types, we demonstrate superior prognostic performance over conventional segmentation analyses. The method autonomously identified previously unknown and potentially clinically actionable biological patterns. In lung adenocarcinoma, these include a Ki67-mediated immune evasion phenotype, a subcellular pattern of GLB1 expression which aligns with low-grade EGFR-driven tumours, and distinct modes of tumour-immune interaction in PD-L1+ patients. We also find a regulatory T-cell-mediated immunosupressive environment promoting tumour budding in colorectal carcinoma.

Specifically, we generated DIA LC-MS proteomic data (n = 302), analyzed previously generated DNA methylation profiles from our group (n = 310), and used published whole-genome sequencing data (n = 254) to compute polygenic risk scores (PRS). In this cohort, 69% (n = 214) were APOEe4 carriers, and 19.6% (n = 42) of them showed no pathological evidence of AD based on NIA-Reagan criteria, enabling identification of APOEe4-related risk and resilience mechanisms. In the absence of AD, APOEe4 carriers exhibited lower levels of 27 proteins, suggesting early synaptic (e.g., VAMP1, SYN3, CASKIN1) and metabolic (e.g., GLUD1, PI4KA) vulnerability. By contrast, APOEe4 carriers with AD displayed marked upregulation of inflammatory and proteostatic proteins (e.g., GNAO1, AHNAK, FGG, HEBP1, APEX1, RAB4A, SLC12A5, LRP1, BAG6) and hypermethylation of cg06329447 in ELAVL4. Network analyses highlighted convergent disruptions in synaptic transmission, metabolism, and proteostasis -- key pathways altered in APOEe4-associated AD. Mediation analyses identified GRIPAP1 and GSTK1 as top protein mediators (accounting for ~26-33% of APOEe4's effect), with VAMP1, CASKIN1, DPP3, SYN3, and FGG each contributing ~9-15%. ELAVL4 hypermethylation also mediated ~12% of the APOEe4 effect, linking epigenetic dysregulation to disease risk. To assess whether the identified proteins reflected broader genetic risk for AD or were specific to APOEe4, we calculated PRS both excluding and including the APOE genomic region. While the non-APOE PRS showed no association with identified molecular markers, the APOE-inclusive PRS was significantly associated with eight AD-related proteins in carriers, indicating they are not explained by polygenic risk outside of APOE. Finally, predictive modeling stratified by APOEe4 status revealed that in non-carriers, PRS most effectively classified AD (AUC = 0.73), whereas in carriers, proteomic and epigenetic markers outperformed PRS (AUC up to 0.74). Together, these findings demonstrate that APOEe4 confers AD risk through early synaptic and metabolic disruptions and later-stage inflammatory and epigenetic changes, laying the groundwork for genotype-tailored biomarker development and therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

However, whether skeletal muscle retains a memory of disuse remains unknown. We investigated repeated lower-limb immobilization in young adults and a refined aged rat model of repeated disuse, integrating multi-omics, histology, biochemistry, and primary human cell analyses. In young human muscle, a second period of disuse elicited an attenuated transcriptional response in oxidative and mitochondrial pathways, suggesting a protective molecular memory, although this did not translate into attenuated atrophy. In contrast, aged muscle exhibited a detrimental molecular memory, with greater atrophy, exaggerated suppression of aerobic metabolism genes/pathways despite recovery of these genes after initial disuse, depletion of NAD+ and mitochondrial DNA, and activation of proteasomal, extracellular matrix and DNA-damage pathways. Repeated disuse induced DNA hypermethylation and downregulation of aerobic metabolism and mitochondrial genes across species. NR4A1 remained suppressed in young human muscle, whereas acetylcholine receptor subunit genes were epigenetically primed in humans and further upregulated with repeated atrophy in both young and aged muscle. NMRK2 was among the most downregulated genes after both periods of atrophy in humans, and nicotinamide riboside improved myotube size in primary human muscle cells derived post-atrophy. These findings reveal that disuse atrophy imprints a molecular memory in skeletal muscle- attenuated transcriptional resilience in young adults yet exaggerated susceptibility in aged muscle.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Trans-species miRNAs accumulate in host tissues a short distance from the site of parasite attachment. Trans-species miRNAs require C. campestris but not host Dicer-Like 1 (DCL1) for accumulation. These miRNAs specifically avoid Argonaute (AGO) loading in C. campestris tissue where they instead accumulate as miRNA/miRNA* duplexes. After arrival and short-distance spreading in host tissues, they are selectively loaded into host AGO1. This study clarifies the transcription, dicing, delivery, and function of C. campestris trans-species miRNAs. We propose that selective avoidance of self AGO-loading is a mechanism to facilitate the delivery of these \"export only\" miRNAs to host tissues.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear how such variation in autistic traits modulate neural processing of different types of social information. Here, we investigated whether autistic traits in neurotypical individuals are associated with neural responses to a broad array of social perceptual features during viewing naturalistic stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also tested the generalizability of these effects across two experiments. Ninety-seven participants completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and watched a set of 96 movie clips and a full movie during an fMRI scan. Intensity of 126 social features in the movie stimuli was continuously annotated by independent observers, and 44 most reliably rated features were used to model neural responses. We examined how consistently the responses to each social feature were dependent on the participant's AQ scores. Replicable AQ-dependent neural responses to social features were found in both datasets. The temporal cortex and especially the superior temporal gyrus (STG), served as a central \"hub\" where autistic traits consistently modulated responses to social features across datasets. Different AQ subscales also revealed distinct association patterns in other brain regions. These findings indicate that autism-related traits broadly influence neural processing of naturalistic social signals, providing insight into how characteristics of autistic symptoms relate to socioemotional processing.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

This approach works on the principles of overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (OPCR), uses high-fidelity DNA polymerase and short overlapping primers. Target genes can be directly amplified from genomic DNA or complementary DNA (cDNA) templates and cloned into vectors without intermediate purification, restriction enzyme digestion, or ligation. VSR supports the insertion of DNA fragments ranging from 80 bp to 33 kb at any plasmid locus while enabling the introduction of single or multiple nucleotide substitutions at one or more sites in a single reaction. Using this method, we cloned 35 genes of diverse lengths and two complete viral genomes with efficiencies ranging from 60 to 100% and introduced up to 17 substitutions in a single mutagenesis reaction.

Suitable in vitro models to accurately replicate the pathological environment in heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF/HFpEF) are limited, hampering mechanistic studies and drug screening. In particular, these models rarely incorporate immune cells, which play a critical role in heart failure. To address these limitations, we developed an isogenic 3D induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiac spheroid model incorporating monocytes. Methods and results Cardiac spheroids were assembled from three healthy female iPSC lines: three-cell-type (3CT) spheroids consisting of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, and four-cell-type (4CT) spheroids additionally containing monocytes. After six days of culture, established spheroids were treated for 24 h with different known heart failure-associated triggers (glucose & tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF[a]) or ischaemia with/without reoxygenation). Differences between treated and control 3CT and 4CT spheroids were investigated at the cellular, molecular, and functional levels using confocal microscopy, RNA expression (qPCR and RNA sequencing), protein secretion using proximity extension assay technology (Olink), and functional analyses of beating rate, contraction, and relaxation. The results confirmed successful monocyte integration in 4CT spheroids, and only spheroids with monocytes (4CTs) exhibited changes in beating rate and relaxation duration upon stimulation, highlighting the necessity of incorporating immune cells to successfully mimic heart failure-associated functional changes. Along with a more pronounced global transcriptomic treatment response and inflammatory changes, additional transcriptomic alterations previously linked to heart failure in patients, as well as changes in metabolism, ion channels, and extracellular matrix pathways, were observed in 4CT compared with 3CT spheroids. Conclusion We showed that immune cell incorporation enhances the functional and transcriptional responses of engineered cardiac tissue to relevant heart failure triggers in vitro and is essential for future studies to elucidate the cellular crosstalk and pathomechanisms.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has emerged as a powerful alternative, enabling automated and unbiased analysis of highly dimensional behavioral data. Here, we present the first systematic review comprehensively mapping the use of AI in behavioral analysis of invertebrate and larval organisms. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we screened literature published between 2015 and May 2025. A total of 97 eligible studies were analyzed for model organisms investigated, AI methods applied, input data characteristics, preprocessing pipelines, model architectures, and evaluation metrics. We observed a steep increase in publications, from only 2 in 2015 to 97 by mid-2025, with the majority originating from the USA, China, and Germany. The most frequently studied organisms included D. melanogaster, C. elegans, and zebrafish larvae, alongside aquaculture and pest species. Since 2021, DL models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including YOLO models, and pose estimation frameworks such as DeepLabCut have dominated the field, while supervised ML remains common for classification tasks, and unsupervised learning is primarily applied in exploratory clustering. Input data were typically video or image recordings, but reporting practices were highly inconsistent regarding resolution, frame rate, preprocessing steps, and model training details. Evaluation metrics also varied widely, limiting reproducibility and cross-study comparisons. To address these gaps, we propose a standardized reporting framework encompassing input data specifications, preprocessing pipelines, model architecture, and evaluation metrics.

To test this, syngas and corn silage were provided to a 10-L semi-continuous fermenter for 209 days of operation in a first-of-a-kind study at this scale.

Despite high cure rates, a significant subset of patients have aggressive HPV+ OPSCC that recurs; deciphering the underlying mechanisms will identify biomarkers that delineate patient subgroups for personalized treatment. In a comprehensive investigation using complementary clinically-relevant models of HPV+ OPSCC, we demonstrated that elevated expression of a HPV16 E6 spliced isoform (E6*I) compared to full-length E6 (E6FL), is critical for aggressive invasion. Introduction of splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) to inhibit E6FL splicing, effectively mitigated invasion. Mechanistic studies revealed that aggressive invasion occurs via E6*I-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin (ECAD) from the cell membrane, consistent with partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT). The clinical relevance of this mechanism was validated in patient cohorts where a reduced ratio of E6FL to all E6 splice variants was associated with high p-EMT signature, lower membrane:cell ECAD, and worse recurrence-free survival. Together, our findings show that low membrane:cell ECAD ratio in pre-treatment biopsies of HPV+ OPSCC, could stratify patients according to risk; patients with a low ratio may not be candidates for treatment de-intensification trials. Importantly, since ECAD detection is by immunohistochemistry, which is widely used even in diagnostic pathology laboratories with limited resources, membrane:cell ECAD ratio could be a clinically scalable biomarker. Targeting E6FL splicing with SSOs should be explored further as a logical strategy for therapeutic intervention in patients with HPV+ OPSCC.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms by which APOE4 alters lipid metabolism are not fully understood. Here, we leveraged a genome-wide CRISPR screen and ATAC-sequencing in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived oligodendrocytes to dissect APOE4's lipid-associated mechanisms of action. Using these approaches, we identified decreased Wnt signaling, and overactive GSK3b activity, as regulators of lipid droplet accumulation in oligodendrocytes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of GSK3b reduced lipid droplets in APOE4 oligodendrocytes, and increased myelination in three-dimensional iPSC-derived brain organoids. Finally, we show that pharmacological inhibition of GSK3b reduces lipid droplets and improves myelination in APOE4;PS19 Tau transgenic mice. Together, our results provide a framework for understanding the mediation of APOE4-related changes to oligodendrocyte lipid metabolism and myelination.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Methods All participants with JIA completed the SARC-F survey and self-reported exercise habits through online questionnaires. We defined two groups based on SARC-F scores as musculoskeletal function impaired (SARC-Fhi+) and musculoskeletal function not impaired (SARC-Fhi-). We used flow cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to define immune cell subpopulations. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software version10. Results Of the 18 participants with a median age of 24 years; five belonged to the SARC-Fhi+ group and 13 to the SARC-Fhi- group, of whom 80% and 38% were female, respectively. The SARC-Fhi+ group had fewer CD45RA+CD27+ naive CD4+ T cells (26.60% vs. 45.30%, p=0.0264) and greater CD45RA-CD27- effector memory CD4+ T cells (11.90% vs. 7.00%, p=0.0350). The SARC-Fhi+ group also had fewer CD56-CD16+ NK cells compared to the SARC-Fhi- group (2.60% v. 4.28%, p = 0.0194). The moderate exercise group (n = 13) had increased numbers of total CD4+ T cells (54.06% vs. 37.30%, p=0.0140) and 3-fold fewer CD45RA+CD27 EMRA CD8+ T cells (3.17% vs. 10.40%, p=0.0350). There were no other significant differences for other immune cells / subpopulations including B cells. Conclusions Our study findings suggest notable differences in immune profile relative to SARC-F score. Furthermore, the 3-fold lower frequency of CD8+ TEMRA subpopulation of T cells, reflective of immunosenescence, suggest a potential inverse relationship between moderate exercise and peripheral immune cell profile in JIA.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Background: Smoltification in anadromous Atlantic salmon is a complex developmental process involving physiological and cellular changes that enable freshwater fish to adapt to seawater. Central to this transformation is the functional transformation of the gill to manage osmoregulatory demands. While environmental cues like photoperiod are known to influence smolt development, the genetic architecture underlying smolt development - particularly related to gill physiology - remains poorly understood. Results: A large-scale eQTL analysis across 3,000 Atlantic salmon subjected to three photoperiod regimes, identified over 45,000 significant SNP-gene expression associations in gill tissue. Notably, we discovered a 0.5 Mbp large trans-eQTL hotspot on chromosome 14. This hub-locus was associated with expression of more than 2,000 genes across the genome which were significantly enriched for gill cell type specific markers. In addition we found that the hub-locus was associated with somatic growth. Our findings support a local tissue effect model, where cis-regulatory or protein sequence variants within the hub-locus modulate cell proliferation and differentiation of gill cell types. Conclusion This work advances our understanding of the genetic basis of smoltification in Atlantic salmon and provides a foundation for future studies using single-cell approaches to resolve cell-type specific mechanisms underlying genetic variation in smolt development.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

NHL genetic and molecular classifications have been intensely studied and correlated with clinical outcomes, but critical unanswered questions relevant to malignancy persist. For example, tumors positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are aggressive and account for 30-50% of HIV-associated NHLs, yet insights on the nature of EBV in NHL pathogenesis or potential therapeutic vulnerabilities have been limited. Here, we examined HIV-associated NHLs stratified by histopathologic classification, cell of origin (COO), molecular subtype, and EBV status using genome-wide spatial transcriptomic analyses. Tumor tissues in EBV+ HIV-NHLs displayed enriched expression of mitochondrial respiration and purine metabolism signatures versus EBV- tumors. Immune infiltration of EBV+ tumors was limited, and immune and stromal regions of EBV+ HIV-NHLs displayed upregulation of the gene for the iron exporter ferroportin (SLC40A1), indicating immunosuppressive macrophage polarization. An immunosuppressive SPP1-CD44 axis and oncogenic GAS6-AXL interaction between tumor and stroma were specifically predicted for EBV+ HIV-NHLs with plasmablastic features. Tumor microenvironment (TME) similarities to secondary lymphoid tissues such as inverse CXCL12-CXCL13 gradients and evidence of matching between tumor B cell phenotypes and reticular cell signatures were also observed. Finally, we developed a simple yet flexible approach to quantify expression gradients and cell proximity to annotated regions. Thus, this study highlights potential avenues for NHL therapy tailored by EBV status and provides a unique resource to examine tumor-TME interactions in the HIV-immunocompromised context.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

However, discovery of such synergistic conjugates is a substantial engineering challenge. Here, we describe pharmacophore-driven antibody discovery as a high throughput approach to hybrid discovery. In this approach, we use a yeast display antibody library containing reactive noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) and further diversify it by conjugating the library to four sulfonamide pharmacophores. Yeast display binding screens with each of the resulting billion-member hybrid collections against bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) yielded diverse collections of hybrids. Individual hybrids exhibited double digit nanomolar binding affinities, and frequently exhibited inhibitory properties in solution, despite the fact that the screens were based solely on binding phenotypes. Deep sequencing of sorted populations revealed that enrichments were strongly pharmacophore-dependent. In particular, screens with a potent pharmacophore led to collections of hybrids varying substantially in pharmacophore attachment point and antibody sequence features, while screens with moderate or weak pharmacophores led to collections with much narrower sets of enriched attachment points and antibody sequence features. Identification of the most frequently isolated CDR-H3 sequences and clustering CDR-H3 sequences by similarity within enriched populations provided further evidence for pharmacophore-dependent sorting outcomes. Experimental binding assays in which the pharmacophore warhead used during screening was replaced by another warhead indicated that isolated clones can tolerate alternative pharmacophores, but tend to prefer the warhead used during screening. Overall, these efforts demonstrate the utility of introducing pharmacophores into antibody libraries along with several lines of evidence that screening outcomes are pharmacophore-driven. These findings advance our understanding of hybrid discovery and highlight opportunities to pursue hybrids as research tools and potential therapeutic leads.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Several strategies have been developed to lower methane emissions from ruminants, including feed additives that inhibit methanogenic archaea. Sustainable solutions must eliminate methane emissions without hampering the microbial fermentation of plant material, which the animal host relies on for carbon and energy. However, current tools cannot directly quantify or characterize the metabolic pathways of in vivo ruminant fermentation. To fill this gap, we developed an electrospray (ESI) Orbitrap mass spectrometry technique to measure the stable isotope ratios 13C/12C and 2H/1H of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) at their natural isotopic abundances directly from rumen fluid. We tested this technique on in vitro incubations of rumen fluid fed three different substrates with and without the additive Asparagopsis taxiformis. We found that the isotope composition of VFAs changed and reflected a remodeling of microbial fermentation pathways. Specifically, acetate's d13C value increased when methanogens were inhibited, suggesting a lower relative rate of acetate synthesis and a lack of acetogenic activity. Furthermore, the d2H value of propionate decreased, which may indicate a change in the balance between the two pathways of propionate synthesis toward the less energetic acrylate pathway. Both signals were consistent across feed types. Taken together, our results provide evidence that fermentative metabolism is remodeled during methanogenesis inhibition and decreases relative fluxes through ATP-generating pathways. More broadly, this study demonstrates the utility of ESI-Orbitrap-based isotopic analysis for studying rumen microbial ecology.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

However, the effects of drying and rehydration on the composition of cellular RNA and metabolites are still poorly understood. Here, we describe how slow drying and rehydration with water vapor influence the composition of RNAs and metabolites in a soil Arthrobacter. While drying reduced cultivability relative to hydrated controls, water vapor rehydration fully restored it. Ribosomal RNA proportions remained constant throughout all treatments, and mRNA profiles showed stable composition during desiccation--changing only during transitions into and out of desiccation-induced dormancy. Six transcriptional modules displayed distinct expression patterns in desiccated-rehydrated samples relative to hydrated controls, including desiccation-rehydration responsive and rehydration-specific profiles. Targeted intracellular metabolomics revealed similarly static profiles during desiccation, with a cluster of ribonucleosides and nucleobases increasing in response to desiccation and returning to baseline levels upon rehydration with water vapor. These findings demonstrate that both mRNA and metabolite profiles remain essentially frozen in desiccated Arthrobacter, with dynamics changes occurring only during state transitions. These results have important implications in environments with frequent drying cycles where stable mRNA in dormant cells combined with intracellular RNA recycling may obscure interpretations of RNA-based environmental analyses that use RNA as a marker of microbial activity.

Thus, the present study investigated microbial communities in different stages of the Bokashi composting process in collaboration with Bokashi practitioners by looking into physicochemical characteristics as well as microbial community composition (16S amplicon sequencing) and functional potential (shotgun metagenome sequencing). The collective results indicate that i) microbial communities in Bokashi compost differed between stages, but also between households, ii) microbial communities were dominated by lactic acid bacteria like Lentilactobacillus or Lacticaseibacillus, iii) metabolic pathways for the production of diverse organic acids were detected, iv) application of Bokashi ferment or leachate to soil can supply nutrients and organic acids to promote plant growth but does not substantially affect soil microbial community composition, and v) potentially pathogenic organisms were detected in extremely low abundances.

Here, we show that in Escherichia coli, cold and heat shocks exert dominance over antibiotic stresses across multiple levels of bacterial physiology. First, combined exposure to antibiotics and thermal shifts produced transcriptomes that consistently converged to temperature-defined transcriptomic states. This dominance emerges through the effects of thermal shifts on metabolism, nucleoid organization, engagement of antibiotic targets with DNA, over-expression of global transcription regulators, drug-target conformational plasticity, and regulatory induction of efflux pathways during combined exposure. Finally, cross-species simulations and phylogenetic analysis revealed that thermal disruption of antibiotic efficiency is conserved across evolutionary distant bacterial species.

L.; Wright, S.; Baucom, R. S.", "abstract": "Evolutionary biologists have long been intrigued by the factors that sustain genetic and phenotypic variation within and among natural populations. Polymorphisms underlying components of floral display -- such as floral color, size, and shape -- are uniquely of interest since variation in these traits impact pollinator attraction, rates of visitation, and pollinator efficiency, which ultimately influence patterns of plant reproduction and therefore fitness. We leverage existing floral variation present within and among populations of Hesperis matronalis (Dames Rocket) to disentangle the relative influence of natural selection and genetic drift in shaping floral trait variation. We employ a multi-tiered approach: we determine if variation in floral traits (color, size, and petal shape) is influenced by geography or environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation, we evaluate whether selection underlies trait variation by comparing phenotypic divergence (PST) with neutral genetic structure (FST), and we perform a Lande-Arnold selection analysis to explore the relationship between fitness and floral trait variation within natural populations. We find that selection underlies the divergence of floral color, floral size, and petal width among H. matronalis populations, with PST > FST for each trait. We find no indication, however, that variation in size in this species is influenced by the environment, but some evidence that variation in floral color and petal shape may be influenced by temperature. Finally, selection analyses of contemporary populations indicate divergent selection affecting combinations of color, petal shape, and plant size. These results suggest that the variation in floral shape in this species may be maintained due to environmental pressures, whereas floral color is influenced by pollinator visibility and the presence of different pollinator groups.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

A juvenile-onset polyneuropathy (JOP) in American Staffordshire Terriers (ASTs) resembles CMT, with motor and sensory deficits, often accompanied by laryngeal paralysis. To identify the underlying genetic cause, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 24 affected and 53 control ASTs that identified a significant locus at the distal end of chromosome 28. Homozygosity mapping analysis further defined a critical interval spanning 11 protein-coding genes and whole-genome sequencing revealed a missense variant in the PAOX gene encoding polyamine oxidase (NC_049249.1:g.41474541G>A ), leading to a glycine-to-arginine substitution at a highly conserved residue, XP_038435135.1:p.(Gly382Arg). Genotypes at this variant were homozygous alternate in 96% of the affected dogs (n=53) and either homozygous reference or heterozygous in 336 unaffected ASTs; the mutant allele was not detected in any of 2519 genomes of other dog breeds. In silico predictions consistently supported its pathogenicity, and structural modeling suggested altered substrate binding. Although PAOX expression was preserved, proteomic profiling in affected nerve tissue revealed reduced levels of myelin-associated proteins, as well as dysregulation of mitochondrial and proteasomal pathways. Our findings establish this PAOX missense variant as the likely cause of JOP in ASTs and highlight the breed as a valuable large-animal model for studying inherited peripheral neuropathies.

This practice relies on an implicit causal model that conflates population structure with confounding. Here, we challenge this approach by developing a unified framework grounded in coalescent theory. We introduce the Coefficient of Genealogical Similarity (GeSi), a statistic derived from a model of shared derived alleles that captures the full continuum of shared ancestry and can be estimated directly from genotype data. This leads to a new classification of GRMs into \"full\" matrices, which capture the complete genealogy, and \"shallow\" matrices, which measure only recent relatedness. Systematic benchmarking demonstrates that full GRMs are sufficient to model the genetic covariance from population structure, rendering PC adjustment for this purpose redundant. This finding clarifies that the justifiable role for PCs in such a model is to correct for true environmental or complex genetic confounders. Our analyses of empirical data confirm that including PCs can improve model fit, providing evidence that such confounding is present and correlated with axes of genetic variation. This work establishes a new theoretical framework that disentangles the modeling of genealogical relatedness from the correction of confounding, re-framing the role of PCs as proxies for the latter and challenging the rationale for including the top PCs merely to capture maximal genetic variance.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Many comorbidities develop with obesity, which impairs quality of life and burdens the health care system. Consequently, there is an urgent need for interventions and treatments to reverse obesity and its comorbidities and restore health. Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SphK1), a key enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism, produces sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid implicated in obesity and metabolic dysfunction. While global deletion of Sphk1 protects against diet-induced obesity, adipocyte-specific SPHK1 deficiency paradoxically promotes weight gain, glucose intolerance, and adipose inflammation. Given the known role of sphingolipids in adipose thermogenesis, we investigated whether Sphk1 regulates adipocyte beiging and mitochondrial function. Methods: We assessed thermogenic responses in SphK1-deficient adipocytes and adipocyte-specific Sphk1 knockout mice under basal and beta3-adrenergic stimulation using CL 316,243. Thermoneutral housing (30 degree C) and room temperature (23 degree C) conditions were used to minimize and assess ambient temperature effects on thermogenesis. Molecular, histological, and bioenergetic analyses were conducted across multiple adipose depots. Results: Beta3-adrenergic stimulation upregulated Sphk1 expression in mature white adipocytes, while SphK1-deficient adipocytes exhibited enhanced Ucp1 expression, indicating a suppressive role for SphK1 in beiging. In vivo, adipocyte-specific Sphk1 knockout mice showed elevated Ucp1 expression in inguinal and gonadal white adipose tissue (iWAT, gWAT), both basally and after CL 316,243 treatment. These changes were accompanied by depot-specific alterations in adipocyte size and increased adiposity, independent of ambient temperature. Despite similar elevation of thermogenic markers, Sphk1 deletion had differential effect on mitochondrial function: iWAT showed increased mitochondrial content but reduced complex IV activity and ATP production, whereas gWAT showed reduced mitochondrial abundance without changes in respiration. Conclusion: Our work suggests that Sphk1 may act as a negative regulator of thermogenic expression and affect mitochondrial function in a depot-specific manner. Loss of Sphk1 enhances beiging but compromises mitochondrial efficiency, revealing a complex role for the SphK1/S1P axis in adipose plasticity and metabolic regulation.

Integrating key drivers across domains identified consistent drivers such as CTNNB1, ACSL1, and ALDH3A2, suggesting fundamental roles contributing to AD risk. Discussion: This highly integrative network-based approach identified context-dependent drivers and enabled the inference of interactions between domains.

Using disease-relevant murine BV2 microglial cell lines with stable Psen2 knockdown, we performed siRNA-mediated perturbations followed by cellular phenotypic assays and quantitative proteomics. Results: Twenty-five candidate targets significantly altered at least one phenotype, with stronger effects in Psen2 knockdown cells. Integrated proteomic analyses identified several perturbations that reversed AD-associated molecular patterns. Five targets--Ap2a2, Pdhb, Pdha1, Dlat, and Psmc3--impacted both phenotypes and related proteomic responses.

Here, we establish a murine model of OA-induced HF using destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) to induce systemic inflammation and sex-specific cardiac remodeling. Longitudinal echocardiography revealed that females develop diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction, resembling HFpEF, whereas males exhibit progressive systolic impairment, consistent with a transitional HFmrEF-to-HFrEF phenotype. Morphometric and histological analyses confirmed concentric hypertrophy in females and eccentric remodeling in males. Transcriptomic profiling identified distinct molecular programs: females upregulated extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal, and calcium-handling genes, while males showed enrichment of inflammatory and immune signaling pathways. Immunoblot analyses further validated these sex-specific molecular signatures: females displayed increased ANP, BNP, Sirt1, and AMPK expression, consistent with metabolic resilience and fibrotic remodeling, whereas males exhibited elevated p38 MAPK, NF-{kappa}B, LC3B, and cleaved caspase-3, reflecting heightened inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis. Both sexes demonstrated downregulation of mitochondrial and lipid metabolic proteins, indicating convergent energetic stress. Collectively, these findings identify OA as a systemic inflammatory driver of heart failure, delineate the molecular and proteomic basis of sex-dependent cardiac remodeling, and introduce a translational preclinical model that recapitulates the clinical heterogeneity of HFpEF and HFmrEF/HFrEF, providing a foundation for mechanistic and therapeutic exploration.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Conversely, a diagnosis of osteoporosis in women is the earliest known predictor for AD. However, mechanisms responsible for the coupled decline in cognitive and skeletal health remain unclear. Proteomic analysis of cortical bone from aged mice revealed neurological disease-associated proteins that are highly enriched in aged mouse bones, including apolipoprotein E (Apoe) and amyloid precursor protein. Further, Apoe localized specifically to bone-embedded osteocytes with expression twice as high in aged female bone as in young or male counterparts. In humans, APOE allele variants carry differing AD risk with age. To investigate APOE allelic roles in bone, we utilized a humanized APOE knock-in mouse model that expresses either the protective APOE2, the neutral APOE3, or the AD risk factor APOE4, and analyzed bone and hippocampus from the same mice. APOE4 exerted strong sex-specific effects on the bone transcriptome and proteome, relative to APOE2 or APOE3. Interestingly, the APOE4-associated perturbation in the female bone proteome was more pronounced than the corresponding alterations observed in the hippocampus. APOE4 protein causes bone fragility in females, but not males, even without changes in cortical bone structure. These bone quality deficits arose from suppression of osteocyte perilacunocanalicular remodeling. We find that APOE4 is a new molecular culprit capable of disrupting osteocyte maintenance of bone quality as early as midlife in a manner that disproportionately affects females. These findings highlight osteocytes as potential targets for early diagnosis of age-related cognitive impairment, and treatment for bone fragility, in females.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

ASX-173 reduces cellular asparagine levels, induces the integrated stress response (ISR), and reduces cell growth in HEK-293A cells. A cryo-EM structure reveals that ASX-173 engages a unique, hydrophobic pocket formed by AMP, Mg2+, and pyrophosphate in the C-terminal synthetase domain of ASNS, thereby enabling multivalent, high-affinity binding. Based on in vitro kinetic and thermal shift assays, we find that ASX-173 binds to the ASNS/Mg2+/ATP complex and is therefore a rare example of an uncompetitive enzyme inhibitor with potential therapeutic use.

In C. elegans, unc-45(m94) mutants recover motility after heat-induced paralysis despite persisting sarcomeric disorganisation, offering a model to dissect non-contractile drivers of early recovery. Quantitative proteomics identified ALLO-1, a selective autophagy adaptor previously characterised for mediating paternal mitochondrial elimination during embryogenesis, as strongly upregulated during the recovery phase. Proteomic and genetic analyses further revealed a network of ALLO-1-associated factors, including the kinase IKKE-1 (a known ALLO-1 activator), SIP-1 (a small heat shock protein), DIM-1 (a sarcomeric tether), and CAR-1 (an ER-associated RNA-binding protein). In adult muscle, ALLO-1 restrains mitophagy to preserve mitochondrial integrity. Its depletion triggers mitochondrial fragmentation and excessive turnover, especially in the sensitised unc-45(m94) background. Overexpression suppresses mitophagy but reduces oxidative capacity, revealing a dosage-sensitive checkpoint. While IKKE-1 and SIP-1 promote mitochondrial stability, DIM-1 and CAR-1 facilitate turnover when ALLO-1 levels fall below threshold.

Effective management of invasive species requires accurate abundance estimates through time, particularly at large spatial scales. Traditional methods of abundance estimation from management data, such as camera trap studies and harvest data, face challenges due to variations in sampling protocols and effort standardization. We propose an extension to a previously calibrated removal model by integrating into an Integrated Population Model (IPM) and incorporating multiple removal techniques. The model utilizes management and land cover data, both of which are readily available in many invasive species systems. We evaluate the model with a simulation study, then apply it to management data on wild pigs (Sus scrofa). Simulations showed that the model performs well across a wide range of densities and population trajectories. Density estimates were the most biased when effort and density were low and sharpshooting or fixed wing aircraft were used to conduct removals. We discuss the advantages and limitations of using removal models for invasive species management, how the model performs with respect to previous removal modeling efforts, how performance might be improved through changes to data management practices, and the model's potential to inform decision-making processes for invasive species management.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

However, often the inference is instead done by adopting 20-state amino acid replacement models that do not explicitly consider synonymous substitution. When there is substantial heterogeneity of amino acid frequencies among sites and/or among lineages, another sort of character recoding is sometimes performed. In these cases, one option is to reduce the state space of the model by placing each of the 20 amino acids into one of a relatively small number (e.g., 6) of groups of amino acids and then modeling only how group membership changes at a site over evolutionary time. Unfortunately, these kinds of character recoding schemes are prone to reducing the amount of available evolutionary information. Here, we provide a likelihood framework to statistically assess recoding schemes. Although we concentrate on the recoding of 61-state codon substitution models into 20-state amino acid replacement models, the general approach is also relevant to other recoding schemes such as those that recode 20-state models into 6-state models.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that GSDMA is S-acylated at the conserved cysteine residues in its N-terminal domain. We show that S-acylation of GSDMA promotes pyroptosis by facilitating its membrane anchoring and protein oligomerization, a mechanism distinct from the palmitoylation of GSDMD at the N-terminal C191 residue. Additionally, we present evidence that recombinant proteins of GSDMA and GSDMD can undergo S-acylation in vitro via direct interaction with palmitoyl-CoA, suggesting they potentially possess auto-acylation capacity. Furthermore, we identify ABHD17A as one of the deacylating enzymes that regulate the dynamic fatty acylation cycle of GSDMA.

Here, using a new two-step crosslinker installation process, we demonstrate that the yield of the chemical reaction is not the limiting factor in sampling the interactome. Low crosslink detection levels persist even when crosslink yields approach 30% of total peptide. We show that crosslinked peptides are not preferentially lost during sample workup; they enter the mass spectrometer at least as efficiently as linear peptides. Low detection rates arise mostly from severe signal splitting that reduces the S/N of crosslinked peptides, which is likely exacerbated by low-sensitivity database search tools and compounded by ion suppression.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

They are crucial for maintaining cell structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and ensuring proper chromosome segregation among other things. These biological functions are influenced by the dynamic instability of the MT plus-end tip. Recent work has challenged traditional models in which GTP (guanosine-5'-triphosphate) hydrolysis directly regulates microtubule lattice stability. To explore these notions further, in this work, we have constructed, from bottom up, a relatively high resolution coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) model for tubulins with 20 CG sites per tubulin monomer and then performed extensive CG MD simulations on MT lattices with 8 and 40 layers of heterodimers. Our findings demonstrate that, independent of nucleotide state, MT plus-end tips can form distinct, similarly curved protofilament (PF) clusters. These clusters are stable up to tens of microseconds of CG MD simulation time during spontaneous outward bending relaxation, and their formation is driven by an intrinsic thermodynamic instability of the MT lattice. Such lattice instability accumulates in longer microtubules and further facilitates protofilament cluster formation with outward bending relaxation; however, in longer MTs the lattice instability can also be released via lattice curvature and in-lattice twisting. Our systematic parametrization of the CG forcefield from atomic scale interactions also confirms weakened lateral interactions in GDP-MTs, which lead to faster bending relaxation and the formation of more PF clusters in both 8-layer and 40-layer GDP-bound MT lattices. A comprehensive all-atom MD analysis reveals that the formation of PF clusters is initiated by relaxation in the longitudinal interactions and later stabilized by relaxation in the lateral interactions. Our findings highlight the critical role of lattice instability in microtubule dynamics and offer new insight on the behavior of MT plus-end tips.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Here we report that hypoxia causes major changes in zebrafish transcriptomic landscapes with hormonal activity or hormonal signaling identified as most prominently up-regulated GO term and KEGG pathway. Among the top in this group is Stanniocalcin 2a (Stc2a), a secreted glycoprotein that inhibits insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling by binding to pappalysin metalloproteinases and inhibiting their activities. The hypoxic induction of stc2a expression is attenuated in Hif2-deficient fish. Genetic deletion of Stc2a increased the developmental speed and growth rate, resulting in enlarged adult organ and body size. Under hypoxia, stc2a-/- fish grew faster than wild-type fish but showed reduced survival rate. These phenotypes were reversed by inhibiting pappalysin activity or blocking IGF signaling. These findings suggest that Stc2a limits IGF-mediated growth in favor of survival and that the induction of Stc2a is part of a conserved mechanism regulating the trade-off between somatic growth and survival under hypoxic stress.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

Coastal monkeyflowers take up less sodium through the leaf surface under experimental salt spray, which may contribute to local adaptation under oceanic salt spray in coastal habitats.

Activity-dependent labelling with FM4-64 allowed us to compare activated (FM+) and non-activated synapses and thereby compare homo- and hetero-synaptic sLTP. In addition, we related spine volume changes according to the probability of release, P(r), of activated synapses. At homosynaptic sites there was the expected NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent potentiation of spine volume that persisted throughout the recording period. We found that this sLTP also required the synaptic activation of CP-AMPARs. There was also sLTP at heterosynaptic sites that, surprisingly, developed more quickly than the associated homosynaptic sLTP. This heterosynaptic sLTP was also dependent on the synaptic activation of both NMDARs and CP-AMPARs. Additionally, we observed a trans- and hetero-synaptic interaction, whereby the heterosynaptic spines grew according to the P(r) of the neighbouring active (homosynaptic) synapse. These observations have therefore advanced our understanding of sLTP in several ways; the first demonstration of the absolute requirement for the synaptic activation of CP-AMPARs for sLTP; the magnitude of heterosynaptic sLTP relative to homosynaptic sLTP and the hitherto unexpected combination of trans- and hetero-synaptic interactions.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

We analyzed MRI data of 2,120 healthy adults (1,243/877 F/M; 18 -90 years) from three public datasets. Molecular-enriched connectivity maps were derived with Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) using receptor-density templates for the dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), and serotonin (SERT) transporter systems. Support vector regression models were applied to predict chronological age from molecular-enriched FC, structural morphometry, or both combined.

We additionally conducted a common-parcellation analysis to assess the impact of differing parcellations between modalities. Single-transporter molecular-enriched FC explained up to 51% of age variance. The most predictive transporter varied by dataset, with DAT dominating in the harmonized and common-parcellation settings. Combining the three molecular-enriched maps consistently improved prediction over any single map and increased explained variance up to 64%.

After learning a motor sequence task while their brain activity was recorded with MEG, participants were distributed in two groups according to whether they slept or were totally sleep deprived during the first post-training night. Consolidation was assessed with a retest in the MEG three days after training.

MEG results showed that initial motor sequence learning was characterized by a progressive decrease in beta Event Related Desynchronization (ERD, 18-25Hz) over bilateral motor areas.

These results extend current models of motor memory consolidation by identifying ERS as an oscillatory marker of sleep-dependent consolidation.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}

H.; Seguin, C.; Zalesky, A.", "abstract": "How the brain orchestrates the flow of information between its multiple functional units flexibly, quickly, and accurately, remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. Multiple theories identify neural oscillations as a likely basis for this process. However, a lack of empirical validation of proposed theories, particularly at the whole-brain scale, has hampered consensus on oscillatory principles governing neural communication, limiting our understanding of a process central to perception and cognition and its integration into experiments and clinical applications. Here, we empirically validate previously proposed neural-oscillatory communication mechanisms in the human brain - specifically those involving power and interareal phase coherence - at the whole-brain scale. We do this by estimating the dependence of inferred communication on oscillatory measures that have been theorised to facilitate communication, in source-localised resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. We find that power and phase coherence in the alpha, beta, and high-gamma bands track communication better than others. Crucially, the relation between communication and oscillatory measures varied across regions, indicating spatial heterogeneity in routing mechanisms. Notably, power and coherence-based principles tracked communication patterns of unimodal regions better than those of transmodal regions. In sum, these findings suggest that the human brain implements regionally specific communication mechanisms with complex neural-oscillatory dependence.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": ""}
