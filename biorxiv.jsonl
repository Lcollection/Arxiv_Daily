Conventional electron microscopy using chemically fixed, metal-stained tissue has identified a proteinaceous, membrane-associated thickening called the 'postsynaptic density' (PSD). Here, we combined mouse genetics and cryo-electron tomography to determine the 3D molecular architecture of fresh isolated and anatomically intact synapses in the adult forebrain. The native glutamatergic synapse did not consistently show a higher density of proteins at the postsynaptic membrane thought to be characteristic of the PSD. Instead, a 'synaptoplasm' consisting of cytoskeletal elements, macromolecular complexes and membrane-bound organelles extended throughout the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Snapshots of active processes gave insights into membrane remodeling processes. Clusters of up to 60 ionotropic glutamate receptors were positioned inside and outside the synaptic cleft. Together, these information-rich tomographic maps present a detailed molecular framework for the coordinated activity of synapses in the adult mammalian brain.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

A.; Santana, L. F.; Moreno, C. M.", "abstract": "Every heartbeat is initiated by a spontaneous electrical signal generated inside the cardiac pacemaker. The generation of this electrical signal depends on the coordinated opening and closing of different ion channels, where voltage-gated L-type calcium channels play a central role. Despite the reliability of the pacemaker, all mammals experience a linear slowdown of the pacemaker rate with age. In humans, this slowing can become pathological and constitutes the main cause for the requirement of the implantation of artificial pacemakers. However, the mechanisms behind the age-associated slowdown of the pacemaker are not well understood. Here, we show that age alters L-type calcium channels in pacemaker cells from mice. The age-associated alterations include: i) a reduction in the density of the channels at the plasma membrane, ii) a reduction in the clustering of the channels, and iii) a decrease in channel open probability. Altogether, these age-associated alterations result in a global reduction of the L-type calcium current density and in a slowdown of the pacemaker diastolic depolarization. Remarkably, increasing the open probability of L-type calcium channels pharmacologically was enough to restore pacemaker rate in old cells to the same levels observed in the young. Overall, our findings provide evidence that proper organization and function of L-type calcium channels is impaired by aging and that this dysfunction contributes to the slowdown of pacemaker cells in old animals.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Recently we demonstrated a link between senescence and extracellular matrix (ECM) dysregulation in lung fibroblasts. Whether this in vitro observation also translates in vivo has not been shown yet. Objectives: To determine whether senescence can contribute to COPD-associated ECM-related changes in lung tissue. Methods: Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were performed on lung tissue from 60 COPD patients (including 18 SEO-COPD patients) and 32 controls. Expression levels of 471 ECM-related genes and proteins were compared between (SEO-)COPD and controls. Differentially expressed ECM-related genes and proteins were then correlated with six major senescence markers. ECM-senescence correlations were validated in primary human lung fibroblasts in vitro. Results: We identified 12 COPD- and 57 SEO-COPD-associated ECM-related genes and 4 COPD- and 9 SEO-COPD-associated ECM-related proteins. More than half (36 out of 68 unique genes) of the (SEO-)COPD-associated ECM-related proteins were significantly correlated with one or more senescence markers at transcript level, with the most and strongest correlations with p21 (26 genes). The correlation of 3 ECM-related genes with p21 was validated in primary lung fibroblasts cultured at baseline and ADAMTS1 was increased in senescence-induced lung fibroblasts. Conclusions: Many of the (SEO-)COPD-associated ECM-related changes in lung tissue were correlated with the senescence marker p21. As many of these ECM-related proteins are involved in ECM organization and include proteases, these results indicate a role for cellular senescence in disturbed ECM organization and protease-antiprotease imbalance in COPD.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Accurate cell division relies on rapid chromosome congression. The kinetochore motor protein CENP-E/kinesin-7 is uniquely required for congression of polar chromosomes. It is currently assumed that CENP-E drives congression by gliding kinetochores along microtubules independently of their biorientation. Here, by studying chromosome movement under different levels of CENP-E activity, we favor an alternative model in which CENP-E initiates congression by promoting stabilization of end-on attachments. In this way, CENP-E accelerates congression initiation without significantly contributing to subsequent movement. Stabilization of end-on attachments on polar chromosomes without CENP-E is delayed due to Aurora kinase-mediated hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-binding proteins and expansion of the fibrous corona. CENP-E counters this by reducing Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation in a BubR1-dependent manner, thereby stabilizing initial end-on attachments, facilitating removal of the fibrous corona, and triggering biorientation-dependent chromosome movement. These findings support a unified model of chromosome movement in which congression is intrinsically coupled to biorientation.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

The strength of covert attention fluctuated rhythmically around 11 Hz. A shift of attention from one alternative to another tended to occur at the trough of this oscillation, presumably enabling comparisons. These shifts further reset the attentional oscillation.

Presently, it is not understood whether Mtb spreads to metabolic organs and brings about these impairments. Here we show that Mtb creates a replication-conducive milieu of lipid droplets in hepatocytes by upregulating transcription factor PPAR{gamma} and scavenging lipids from the host cells. In hepatocytes, Mtb shields itself against the common anti-TB drugs by inducing drug-metabolizing enzymes. Infection of the hepatocytes in the in vivo aerosol mice model can be consistently observed post-week 4 along with enhanced expression of PPAR{gamma} and drug-metabolizing enzymes. Moreover, histopathological analysis indeed shows the presence of Mtb in hepatocytes along with granuloma-like structures in human biopsied liver sections.

A first set of analysis indicated that only downy mildew (DM) significantly affects yield (mass of grape clusters harvested) in our experimental conditions. We then leverage this situation to model the relationship between DM severity (measured by standardized AUDPC) and yield losses at vine stock scale. For AUDPC ranging from 0 to 10%, an increase of the severity of DM of 1% on the clusters decrease yield by 2% regardless of years and sites. These values ranges from 1.1% to 9% when considering the severity of DM on the foliage, depending on sites and years. This variability was correlated with a moisture risk index calculated between crop stages inflorescences visibles to pre-ripening of the berries.

However, commonly used forms of general anesthesia using ethanol, magnesium chloride, and similar agents have certain drawbacks. While these methods effectively induce still states in the octopus, they also affect the peripheral body and nervous system and are therefore less than optimal for studying local behavior in octopus arms and suckers. Further, stupefying effects outlast the anesthetized state. We explore an old, rarely used method of octopus \"hypnosis\" in which tonic immobility is induced as a complementary and sometime alternative method to general anesthesia, as well as being particularly suited to studies of local arm-sucker coordination. We modify the procedure for better handling, unimpeded respiration, and isolation of arm peripheral nervous system from the central nervous system (CNS). In the still state, an arm can be neurophysiologically isolated from the CNS by local Mg2+ injection, removing need for isolation by amputation. Exemplary studies of arm-sucker coordination and electrode placements are presented. Additionally, an intriguing phenomenon is observed where the induction of tonic immobility is notably diminished in cases of senescence.

The Pseudomonas putida toxin-antitoxin (TA) system Xre-RES has an unusual 4:2 stoichiometry including two potential DNA-binding sites, compatible with a complex mechanism of transcriptional autoregulation. Here, we show that the Xre-RES complex interacts specifically with a palindromic DNA repeat in the promoter in a 1:1 molar ratio, leading to transcriptional repression. We determine the 2.7 A crystal structure of the protein-DNA complex, revealing an unexpected asymmetry in the interaction and suggesting the presence of a secondary binding site, which is supported by structural prediction of the binding to the intact promoter region. Additionally, we show that the antitoxin can be partially dislodged from the Xre-RES complex, resulting in Xre monomers and a 2:2 Xre-RES complex, neither of which repress transcription. These findings highlight a dynamic, concentration-dependent model of transcriptional autoregulation, in which the Xre-RES complex transitions between a non-binding (2:2) and a DNA-binding (4:2) form.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

To address this, we have isolated, identified and characterised the bioactivity of the venom metalloproteases of puff adders obtained from a wide range of sources. Prominent in all venoms was an SVMP PI, derived from a PII precursor. This protein existed in either of two forms: non-glycosylated (21 kDa) or glycosylated with either one (26 kDa) or two N-glycans (30 kDa). All the venoms we tested here were found to contain either one or the other form: none had both. The 21 kDa form proved to be highly potent, with alpha-, beta- and in some cases gamma-fibrinogenase activities and were very destructive towards laminin. Prothrombin and Factor X were also extensively degraded by the 21 kDa SVMP, but in neither case did this result in generation of the respective active forms of these clotting factors. In contrast, the two-glycan forms were markedly less active against all of these substrates. The one-glycan form isolated from a Kenyan venom possessed activities that was intermediate between the non- and two-glycan forms. Because of the predominance and ubiquity of these SVMPs in puff adders, and their undoubted clinical significance, we propose to name them the arilysins. The SVMP PIII content of the puff adder venoms was, atypically for African vipers, quite low. In some Kenyan venoms, however, there was an abundant SVMP PIII, with strong gelatinase activity. This protein possesses an unusual oligomeric structure, being a 140 kDa homodimer (c.f. SVMPIII-c) but without the disulphide bonds that normally hold the monomers together in this class of SVMP. This diversity in venom metalloprotease activities is discussed with reference to the potential implications on the pathology of envenomation and the development of therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

However, the potential contribution of non-cell-autonomous factors, particularly the impact of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) within the thymic niche during the initiation phase, remains unexplored. In this study, we combine a cell-based computational model of the thymus with complementary in vivo experiments in medaka (Oryzias latipes) to systematically analyze the impact of 12 cell-autonomous and non-autonomous factors, individually and in combination, on the proliferation of normal and malignant thymocytes carrying interleukin-7 receptor (IL7R) gain-of-function mutations or elevated IL7R levels, as observed in T-ALL patients. By simulating over 1500 scenarios, we show that while a dense TEC network favored the proliferation of normal thymocytes, it inhibited the proliferation of malignant lineages, which achieved their maximal proliferative capacity when TECs were sparsely distributed. Our in silico model further predicts that specific mutations could accelerate proliferative expansion within a few days. This prediction was experimentally validated, revealing the rapid onset of thymic lymphoma and systemic infiltration of malignant T-cells within just 8 days of embryonic development. These findings demonstrate that synergistic interaction between oncogenic alterations and modifications in the thymic niche can significantly accelerate disease progression. Our results also suggest that negative feedback from the proliferative state suppresses thymocyte differentiation.

As spatially limited systems, phagocytes have a maximal phagocytic capacity, at which point further uptake must be blunted. However, the processes responsible for phagocytic appetite exhaustion as phagocytes reach maximal capacity are poorly defined. We found that macrophages at their capacity have lower surface levels of Fc{gamma} receptors but overexpression of these receptors did not increase their capacity, suggesting that receptor levels are not limiting. Instead, surface membrane in-folding, membrane tension, and cortical F-actin were all reduced in exhausted macrophages. While this might contribute to appetite suppression, we also found that \"free\" endosomes and lysosomes were severely depleted in exhausted macrophages. Consequently, focal exocytosis at sites of externally bound particles was blunted. In comparison, macrophages recovered their appetite if phagosome resolution was permitted. Altogether, we propose that depletion of the endomembrane pools is a major determinant of phagocytic fatigue as macrophages reach their maximal phagocytic capacity.\n\nSummary statementMacrophages that reach their maximal phagocytic capacity lose their appetite for further uptake. This appetite exhaustion is driven partly by depletion of endosomes and lysosomes, preventing growth of additional phagocytic cups.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

METHODS: Young adults (n = 27, n = 15 females, BMI = 27.1 {+/-} 4.5; BF% = 30.4 {+/-} 8.7) without overt pathology completed a 100g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Indirect calorimetry before (fasting) and following (30, 60, 90, 120 min) consumption was used to calculate respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and oxidation of carbohydrates (CHO) and fats (FOX). Serum and plasma were collected at corresponding time points and analyzed for blood glucose, insulin, and NEFAs. Data from individuals with normal weight were compared to those with overweight/obesity by two-way repeated measures ANVOA. The effect of BF% on postprandial metabolism was tested via linear mixed models while adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: During the OGTT, blood glucose, serum insulin, plasma lactate, RER, and CHO all significantly increased while plasma NEFAs and whole-body FOX decreased (all p<0.05). BF% modified the relationship between postprandial RER and time (p = 0.019) as well as postprandial CHO and time (p = 0.023) without an effect of BF% on FOX; individuals with higher BF% increase their RER and CHO faster and to a greater extent than those with lower BF%. CONCLUSION: Body fat percentage is associated with greater postprandial metabolic flexibility during an OGTT in young adults. Despite increased adiposity, metabolic flexibility may be preserved, representing a compensatory adaptation to decreased glucose storage in the postprandial period.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

LateC cells lack CD235a (glycophorin A) but have high levels of CD71 and CD105, characterized as Lin-CD123-CD235a-CD49d+CD117+CD34-CD71hiCD105hi. Analysis of ex vivo cultures of bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells showed that acquisition of the CD71hiCD105hi phenotype in lateC occurs through the formation of four other EE subtypes. Of these, two are CD34+ burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cells, distinguishable as CD71loCD105lo early BFU-E (earlyB) and CD71hiCD105lo late BFU-E (lateB), and two are CD34- CFU-E, also distinguishable as CD71loCD105lo early CFU-E (earlyC) and CD71hiCD105lo mid CFU-E (midC). The EE transitions are accompanied by a rise in CD36 expression, such that all lateC cells are CD36+. Patterns of CD34, CD36, and CD71 indicate two differentiation routes-- in one earlyB lose CD34 to form earlyC, and in another, earlyB gain CD36 and CD71hi expression prior to losing CD34 to form midC, bypassing the earlyC stage. Regardless of the route, the transition from midC to lateC requires Epo. All five EE subtypes could be prospectively detected in human BM cells and, upon isolation and reculture, exhibited the potential to continue differentiating along the erythroid trajectory.

In follow-up experiments, the likely target and distractor location rotated dynamically with the frame during learning. This revealed that participants can learn to enhance a likely target location in an object-centered manner. We hypothesized that while space-based learning feeds into a priority map reliant on an egocentric reference frame, object-based learning allows for implicit prioritization of subparts of objects independent of their spatial orientation.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we employed RNA staining of the FB marker gene Col1a1 together with the CM marker gene Actn2 and the Vas_EC marker gene Cdh5 at different stages. This approach enabled us to discern the anatomical pattern of cardiac FBs and identify approximately one EC and four CMs directly interacting with each FB. Molecularly, through the analysis of single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we unveiled collagen as the top signaling molecule derived from FBs influencing CM and Vas_EC development. Subsequently, we used a Pdgfra-CreER controlled diphtheria toxin A (DTA) system to ablate the FBs at different stages. We found that the ablation of FBs disrupted myocardium and vasculature development and led to embryonic heart defects. Using scRNA-seq, we further profiled the ablated hearts and identified molecular defects in their ventricular CMs and Vas_ECs compared to control hearts. Moreover, we identified a reduction of collagen in the ablated hearts and predicted collagen as the major signaling pathway regulating the differentially expressed genes in the ablated ventricular CMs. Finally, we performed both short-term and long-term fibroblast ablation at the neonatal stage. We found that short-term ablation caused a reduction in collagen and Vas_EC density, while long-term ablation may induce compensatory collagen expression without causing heart function reduction. In summary, our study has identified the function of fibroblasts in regulating myocardium and vasculature development and implicated an important role for the collagen pathway in this process.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

However, Aurora kinases both inhibit and promote congression, suggesting the presence of a larger signaling network. Our study demonstrates that centrosomes inhibit congression initiation when CENP-E is inactive by regulating the activity of kinetochore components. Depleting centrioles via Plk4 inhibition allows chromosomes near acentriolar poles to initiate congression independently of CENP-E. At centriolar poles high Aurora A enhances Aurora B activity, increasing phosphorylation of microtubule-binding proteins at kinetochores and preventing stable microtubule attachments in the absence of CENP-E. Conversely, inhibiting Aurora A or expressing a dephosphorylatable Hec1 mutant enables congression initiation without CENP-E. We propose a self-limiting feedback mechanism involving Aurora kinases and CENP-E that regulates the timing of chromosome movement by modulating kinetochore-microtubule attachments and fibrous corona expansion, with Aurora A activity gradient providing critical spatial cues for the networks function.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Focusing on spermatogenesis, we demonstrate here that ATAD2 regulates the HIRA-dependent localization of H3.3 on the genome and influences H3.3-mediated gene transcription. Moreover, by modulating histone eviction and the assembly of protamines, ATAD2 ensures proper chromatin condensation and genome packaging in mature sperm.

Although inducible defences have been studied mainly within a generation (within-generational plasticity), there is now clear evidence that ancestral exposure to predation risk can influence the defences expressed by offspring, even if they have not been exposed themselves (transgenerational plasticity). The molecular mechanisms allowing the transmission of environmental information across generations are not well understood. In this study, we combined measures of antipredator responses (behavioural and morphological) with transcriptomic investigations across two generations in the freshwater snail Physa acuta. We hypothesised that both within- and transgenerational plasticity would induce phenotypic changes associated with differential gene expression. Our results confirmed within- and transgenerational plasticity: F1 snails respond to predator-cue exposure by increasing escape behaviour, reducing shell length, and developing thicker and slenderer shells, whereas F2 snails from exposed parents have longer and thicker shells with narrower apertures. Within- and transgenerational plasticity were accompanied by the differential expression of 112 genes (101 up- and 11 downregulated) and 23 differentially expressed genes (17 up- and 6 downregulated), respectively. Within- and transgenerational plasticity did not share common differentially expressed genes, but the associated molecular functions, involving metabolism and transcription regulation, were similar.

Its mechanisms have been extensively investigated, including our recent studies showing with experimental and computational approaches that the hyperactivity of GABAergic neurons can initiate migraine-related CSD because of spiking-generated extracellular potassium (K+) build-up. However, less is known about the role played by GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation. Here we studied mechanisms of CSD propagation, focusing on the role of GABAergic neurons, with experiments performed in mouse brain slices and with a new spatially extended neural field computational model. Experimentally, we induced CSD by applying brief puffs of potassium chloride (KCl) in somatosensory cortex slices from wild type and VGAT-ChR2-tdtomato mice, which specifically express the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in GABAergic neurons. We evaluated the role of GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation by modulating their activity with optogenetic illumination and their synaptic connections with pharmacological tools. We have developed the computational model to obtain realistic simulations of both initiation and propagation of CSD. It includes large populations of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the effect of extracellular ion concentrations on their features. We found that the decrease of the synaptic activity of GABAergic neurons can enhance CSD propagation, because of the reduction of the inhibitory synaptic weight, whereas their spiking activity can enhance CSD propagation because of extracellular K+ upload. However, differently from for CSD initiation, the latter effect is normally hidden by the action of GABAergic synaptic transmission. A reduction of GABAergic synaptic transmission, which can be observed in pathological states, can reveal the potentiating effect of the K+ upload induced by GABAergic activation. The neural field model that we implemented can generate accurate simulations of CSD, providing testable hypotheses on mechanisms, and can also be used for modeling other (patho)-physiological activities of neuronal networks.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Protective coating of DNA nanostructures with materials like silica or cationic polymers has evolved as a simple, yet powerful strategy to improve their stability even under extreme conditions. While over time, various materials and protocols have been developed, the characterization and quality assessment of the coating is either time consuming, highly invasive or lacks detailed insights on single nanostructures. Here, we introduce a cyanine dye based molecular sensor designed to non-invasively probe the coating of DNA origami by either a cationic polymer or by silica, in real-time and on a single nanostructure level. The cyanine dye reports changes in its local environment upon coating via increased fluorescence lifetime induced by steric restriction and water exclusion. Exploiting the addressability of DNA origami, the molecular sensor can be placed at selected positions to probe the coating layer with nanometer precision. We demonstrate the reversibility of the sensor and use it to study the stability of the different coatings in degrading conditions.

R.", "abstract": "SUMMARY PARAGRAPHThe Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is fundamental to embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and cancer. Hh signals are transduced via an unusual mechanism: upon agonist-induced phosphorylation, the noncanonical G protein-coupled receptor SMOOTHENED (SMO) binds the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C) and physically blocks its enzymatic activity. By combining computational structural approaches with biochemical and functional studies, we show that SMO mimics strategies prevalent in canonical GPCR and PKA signaling complexes, despite little sequence or secondary structural homology. An intrinsically disordered region of SMO binds the PKA-C active site, resembling the PKA regulatory subunit (PKA-R) / PKA-C holoenzyme, while the SMO transmembrane domain binds a conserved PKA-C interaction hub, similar to other GPCR-effector complexes. In contrast with prevailing GPCR signal transduction models, phosphorylation of SMO promotes intramolecular electrostatic interactions that stabilize key structural elements within the SMO cytoplasmic domain, thereby remodeling it into a PKA-inhibiting conformation. Our work provides a structural mechanism for a central step in the Hh cascade and defines a paradigm for disordered GPCR domains to transmit signals intracellularly.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "It is a common observation that individuals within a species age at different rates. Variation in both genetics and environmental interaction are generally thought responsible. Surprisingly, even genetically identical organisms cultured under environmentally homogeneous conditions age at different rates, implying a more fundamental cause of aging. Here we have examined the basis for lifespan variance in haploid, single-celled yeast of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The probabilistic nature of metabolism means metabolites often, but not always, follow the same route through the metabolic network. We speculate redundancy in metabolic pathway choice is sufficient to explain lifespan variance. To interrogate the reaction flux space of S. cerevisiae we used a model of its intermediary metabolism, comprising 1,150 genes, 4,058 reactions, and 2,742 metabolites (yeast GEM_v8.5.0). We restricted traffic through the metabolic network by knocking out each of the 1,150 genes, then generated a total of 406,500 flux distributions spanning the solution space of the resulting 812 viable mutants. We collected replicative life span (RLS) data for the 812 viable mutants, corresponding to 66,400 individual cells. Four approaches were then employed to test whether reaction flux configuration could be used to predict lifespan: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in conjunction with non-linear modeling of RLS; deep learning of RLS using either a Regression Neural Network (RNN) or a Classification Neural Network (CfNN); and deep learning using a convolutional neural network (CNN) following conversion of flux distributions to pixelated images. The four approaches reveal a core network of highly correlated reactions controlling aging rate that is sufficient to explain all lifespan variance. It includes biosynthetic pathways encompassing ceramides, monolysocardiolipins, phosphoinositides, porphyrin and glycerolipids. Our data lead to two novel conclusions. First, variance in the replicative lifespan of S. cerevisiae is an emergent property of its metabolic network. Second, there is convergence among metabolic configurations toward three meta-stable flux states; one associated with extended life, another with shortened life, and a third with wild type life span.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

However, the genomic diversity of Rickettsiella remains largely unexplored, and their genetic potential to induce complex phenotypes in arthropods is only partially understood. In this study, we sequenced five new Rickettsiella genomes isolated from three tick species.

To support detailed examination of gene models and paralogous gene family members, we used published parasitic plant genomes, as well as a recently generated draft genome assembly and annotation of Triphysaria versicolor. One particular PLL gene, denoted as PLL1 in parasitic Orobanchaceae, emerged as an important candidate gene for parasitism, as highlighted by our previous comparative transcriptomics research; it belongs to the largest sub-clade of the PLL gene family and is highly upregulated in haustoria. To explore its function in haustorium development, we manipulated PLL1 expression in T. versicolor, a model parasitic species from Orobanchaceae, using direct transformation of the parasite and host-induced-gene-silencing (HIGS). For HIGS, we generated transgenic Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana hosts expressing hairpin RNAs targeting the PLL gene in T. versicolor. Both experimental approaches effectively reduced the PLL1 expression in the haustorium of T. versicolor, resulting in an increased frequency of poorly adhered parasites. These findings demonstrate that PLL1 plays a crucial role in haustorium development and suggest it as a promising target for managing parasitic weeds.

Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial 'feature dimension maps', which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location which always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus, or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended, and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. While enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions was consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant.

At regular time points during experimental evolution, we made crosses between parallel- and divergent-evolving populations to measure postzygotic reproductive isolation (gamete viability). We used whole genome population sequencing to determine the mutational load, the number and types of structural variation, and other genomic features of the parent, F1, and F2 intraspecific hybrids. We found evidence for large scale phenotypic and genome-wide differentiation in response to divergent laboratory selection. Divergent-selected populations produced hybrids with reduced gamete viability - a classic signature of postzygotic reproductive isolation in the form of hybrid breakdown. Parallel-selected populations on the other hand remained more reproductively compatible (with exceptions). We found that F2 hybrid genomes contained vast genomic instability, i.e., new structural variants (especially insertions, deletions, and interchromosomal translocations) that were not observed in parent and F1 genomes, which is likely a result of chromosome missegregation and recombination errors in hybrid meiosis.

Traditional Machine Learning (ML) approaches rely on manually engineered electrophysiological (EP) features, often overlooking subtle and complex patterns within spike train data. This study introduces a novel Spike Train Scalograms (STS)-based Deep Learning (DL) pipeline that integrates Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) scalograms with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to classify neuronal cell types with high accuracy. Utilizing patch-clamp EP recordings from 5,590 murine cortical neurons, the pipeline transforms spike trains into time-frequency representations via CWT, capturing both transient and sustained signal characteristics. These scalograms are then processed by fine-tuned CNN architectures, including InceptionV3, which achieved a balanced accuracy and weighted F1-Score of 90.53% and 90.03%, respectively. The STS pipeline effectively distinguishes between major neuronal types such as Pvalb, Sst, Vip/Lamp5, and Excitatory neurons, even in the presence of class imbalances. Moreover, an explainability analysis using saliency maps and SHAP revealed high correspondence between the DL approach, the ML baseline and biological knowledge of these neuronal types. The results demonstrate that, by combining an advanced spectral analysis with DL techniques, neurons can be classified with high accuracy, employing only two raw sweeps rather then the full stimulation range required by shallow approaches.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}
{"title": "The evolution of host exploitation by parasitoid wasps: the timing of attack and consumption", "doi": "10.1101/2025.02.22.639661", "authors": "Isshiki, R.; Iritani, R.", "abstract": "In some parasitoid wasp species, larvae consume their host immediately after hatching (\"idiobiont\"), while in other species, larvae delay the consumption of the host until its maturation (\"koinobiont\"). The delayed emergence is a life-history trait associated with numerous life-history traits including lifespan and body size. Consequently, the evolution of delayed emergence has been studied as an explanation for the diversity of life-history strategies in parasitoid wasps. Previous studies have provided support for the association between delayed emergence trait and other life-history traits such as fecundity and parasitoid-induced additional mortality. However, these results lack an adaptive evolutionary explanation necessary to establish delayed emergence as a key factor in life-history diversity. In this study, we develop mathematical models to examine associations between delayed emergence trait and other life-history traits. Specifically, we studied the evolutionary dynamics of delayed emergence and resulting life-history characteristics of host exploitation. Our results predict that the reproductive values vary with which of the developmental stages of hosts they parasitize and thus determine the optimal target for parasitoids. Several empirical studies support the predictions. Additionally, the evolution of delayed emergence can profoundly alter the life-cycles of parasitoid wasps. For example, in species with delayed emergence, wasps attack young hosts that initially have low reproductive value for parasitoids, but only consume them after the hosts mature and their reproductive value increases. These findings suggest that delayed emergence may be a driver of the syndrome involving multiple traits related to host exploitation in parasitoid wasps. The high diversity of parasitoid wasps provides a rich system for testing hypotheses about life-history syndromes. By linking delayed emergence to broader life-history strategies, this study lays a theoretical foundation for understanding life-history syndromes in parasitoid wasps.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

To improve model performance, the global wheat dataset consortium assembled a diverse set of images from experiments around the globe. After the head detection dataset (GWHD), the new dataset targets a full semantic segmentation (GWFSS) of organs (leaves, stems and spikes) covering all developmental stages.

The labelled set was used to train segmentation models based on DeepLabV3Plus and Segformer. Our Segformer model performed slightly better than DeepLabV3Plus with a mIOU for leaves and spikes of ca. 90%. However, the precision for stems with 54% was rather lower.

In metagenomic studies, fragments can be mapped against multiple references or de novo assembled contigs to identify those likely to be ancient. Generating and comparing damage profiles to identify samples or contigs that are likely to stem from modern contaminants, however, can be both tedious and time-consuming. Although tools exist for estimating damage in single reference genomes and metagenomic datasets, none efficiently cluster damage patterns. Results To address this methodological gap, we developed AdDeam, a tool that combines rapid damage estimation with clustering for streamlined analyses and easy identification of potential contaminants or outliers.

We evaluated AdDeam on both simulated and empirical datasets. AdDeam effectively distinguishes different damage levels, such as UDG-treated samples, sample-specific damages from specimens of different time periods, and can also distinguish between contigs containing modern or ancient fragments, providing a clear framework for aDNA authentication and facilitating large-scale analyses.

The metabolic interdependence of dual intracellular polymers, namely polyphosphate (polyP) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), is a defining feature of functionally polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs), the key agents enabling enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) for wastewater treatment. However, beyond EBPR systems, the presence and identities of PAOs that possess both polyP and PHA in natural environments such as soil have never been examined due to a lack of available detection tools, despite their potential roles in carbon and phosphorus cycling. This study presents a novel phenotype-targeted approach integrating triple-stained fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (termed TriFlow-Seq) to simultaneously detect, quantify, and phylogenetically characterize PAOs accumulating both polyP and PHA (referred to as PHA-PAOs).

Application to EBPR systems successfully enriched known PHA-PAOs, including Candidatus Accumulibacter, Tetrasphaera, Dechloromonas, Pseudomonas. It also revealed novel candidate PHA-PAOs, particularly within the Rhodobacteraceae family. When applied to soil samples, TriFlow-Seq led to the first discovery of diverse PHA-PAOs dominated by Pseudomonas, Halomonas, and Nannocystis in maize rhizosphere soils. These predominant genera are known rhizosphere inhabitants of essential crops with key plant growth-promoting functions, including phosphate solubilization, biofilm formation, and phytohormone production, yet simultaneous polyP and PHA accumulation has not been directly reported in the maize rhizosphere.

However, the precise tuning of these neuron models remains a major aspect of modeling work to accurately reproduce neuronal properties and understand their implications in network activity. To this end, the precise characterization of neuronal electrophysiological properties, from linear properties to the input-output (I/O) relationship and spike frequency adaptation, from intracellular recordings is a crucial step. Furthermore, the increasing availability of publicly accessible databases opens the possibility of deriving I/O properties for point-neuron models from multiple datasets studying different neuronal populations. However, despite recent advancements in establishing universal data formats for electrophysiological studies, challenges persist due to the absence of standardized protocols (notably for current-clamp experiments) and unified data analysis methods, hindering cross-database comparisons of electrophysiological features.\n\nTo address these limitations, we developed the TACO pipeline, a free, Python-based pipeline for analyzing databases of current-clamp recordings. The TACO pipeline is designed to be user-friendly, minimizing the need for manual implementation of database-specific data extraction methods and enabling the application of user-defined quality control criteria. The pipeline incorporates robust methods for characterizing neuronal I/O relationships, spike-related feature adaptation, and estimating common experimental artifacts such as bridge errors. These methods have been designed to accommodate variability in database-specific experimental design, the sampling of the input space being of particular importancee. We validated the utility of this approach by demonstrating performance comparable to or exceeding that of machine learning models reported in the literature for neuronal type classification, using protocol-agnostic features extracted by the pipeline.

To understand the functional impact of this heterogeneity in the brain, network models need to consider how this is manifested at the level of cellular properties, and thus how to consider variability in reported experimental data. Many studies have pointed out the variability in neuronal density, structural organization or synaptic connectivity across different neuronal networks and populations. Similarly, neuronal physiological properties are known to greatly vary across neuronal populations. Yet, the characterization of electrophysiological diversity has mainly relied on descriptions of firing properties (e.g. bursting, spike frequency adaptation) with various quantitative definitions of the boundaries between neuronal classes (e.g. fast spiking, regular spiking). Furthermore, lab specific implementations of experimental design and data analysis are an obstacle for comparisons between studies. In this context, the quantitative consideration of neuronal variability across commonly accepted neuronal classes provides an objective approach to describe neuronal physiological heterogeneity.\n\nWe analyzed several publicly available databases to characterize the variability of linear and input/output properties of cortical neurons, according to multiple factors covering the entire cortical neuronal population. We assessed the variability of the main cortical neuron types (Excitatory, PValb, Sst, Htr3a, Vip), revealing their heterogeneity as function of cortical area (primary visual, motor and somato-sensory areas), including between layers within a given area. Our comparative database study revealed that different experimental conditions (e.g., in-vitro vs. in-vivo, recording temperature) can influence the properties of any given cell type, while preserving overall differences between types. We find that considering the input to a given neuron in terms of the effective voltage response of a linear model can account for some of the heterogeneity of I/O properties, and suggest that these properties are directly linked to cell input resistance, thus cell size.

Additionally, novel high throughput microfluidic systems, which support 3D cell culture under flow conditions, provide a platform for closely mimicking in vivo environments. This study presents an enhanced in vitro model of human distal tubule segments by integrating tubuloid culture with the OrganoPlate(R) platform. Tubuloid cells were grown as three-dimensional tubules against a collagen-1 matrix and under alternating flow condition, then differentiated into a distal phenotype. qPCR analysis demonstrated enhanced expression of distal segment markers in 3D flow cultures compared to traditional 2D models. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the formation of a leak-tight, highly polarized epithelium with apical and basolateral localization of key electrolyte transporters. Functional integrity was verified by restricted dextran diffusion and increased transepithelial resistance. Radiolabeled sodium assays revealed active and selective sodium transport mediated by apical epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and basolateral Na/K ATPase. Sodium transport was followed by water movement, evidenced by dome formation beneath the epithelial monolayer. The models utility was further demonstrated in toxicity studies using trimethoprim, an antibiotic that inhibits ENaC function, resulting in reduced sodium transport and dome formation. This system enables the study of primary human tubule cells with a distal phenotype under controlled flow conditions, allowing direct assessment of water and salt transport.

While plants actively synthesize ascorbate during the day, its degradation becomes prominent under prolonged dark conditions. Since ascorbate degradation begins with its oxidized form, dehydroascorbate (DHA), this process inherently requires ascorbate oxidation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying dark-induced ascorbate oxidation and subsequent degradation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of intracellular and extracellular ascorbate redox regulation in controlling this process. Using Arabidopsis knockout mutants for key enzymes involved in ascorbate oxidation and recycling, including ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and ascorbate oxidase (AO), as well as NADPH oxidases (rbohD and rbohF), we found that none of these enzymes significantly influenced the dark-induced decrease in ascorbate levels. Notably, ascorbate levels decreased similarly in newly generated multiple mutants, including a quintuple mutant ({triangleup}dhar pad2 mdar5), which has severely impaired ascorbate recycling capacity, and the ao2 rbohD double mutant, which is strongly expected to exhibit a highly altered apoplastic redox state. Furthermore, we examined the potential involvement of senescence signaling, including ORESARA1 and ethylene signaling components, but found no evidence for their contribution. These findings indicate that the dark-induced decrease in ascorbate levels is not governed by conventional pathways for ascorbate oxidation and recycling or senescence signaling processes, suggesting an unidentified regulatory mechanism.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Traditional motility assessment methods primarily focus on static velocity parameters, often overlooking temporal declines in motility during the sperm trajectory. Objective: We aimed to develop and validate a novel fatigue-based profiling approach to assess intra-trajectory motility decline in human spermatozoa. Methods: Using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA)-derived motion tracking data from 1,118 sperm trajectories, we introduced the Fatigue Index, a log-fold metric quantifying the decline in forward progression (VSL) over time. Fatigue status was classified using complementary strategies, including fixed and percentile-based thresholds, z-score normalization, and unsupervised clustering. Descriptive and feature-level analyses were performed to characterize motility patterns associated with fatigue. Results: Fatigued spermatozoa exhibited significantly lower straight-line velocity (VSL: 18.4 vs 42.7 m/s) and steeper VSL slopes (-0.34 vs -0.08 m/s/frame) compared to non-fatigued counterparts. The Fatigue Index reliably identified subpopulations of sperm with time-dependent motility deterioration across multiple classification schemes. Conclusions: Fatigue-based temporal profiling offers a new dimension for understanding sperm motility, highlighting the dynamic nature of forward progression and identifying subtle impairments that may be overlooked by conventional assessment methods.

Using E. coli and its phages allowed us to institute a number of control infections that would be difficult with other organisms. Our findings support a two-step infection model where bound phages may disengage under unfavorable conditions to avoid non-productive infections. The correlation between infection rates under good conditions and host metabolism sensitivity is consistent with error correction, with a cost associated with a high off-rate for reversible phage binding to its host. Our results highlight host physiology as a key factor in virus-host interactions under energy-limited conditions.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

These genes must be transcribed and translated in coordination with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS components to ensure correct stoichiometry during OXPHOS complex assembly in the mitochondria. While much is known about nuclear gene regulation during metabolic stresses like glucose deprivation, little is known about the accompanying transcriptional response in mitochondria. Using microscopy, roadblocking qPCR, and transcriptomics, we studied mitochondrial transcription in cells subjected to glucose deprivation, which is known to cause nuclear transcription downregulation and to activate the integrated stress response (ISR). We found that glucose deprivation stabilizes mitochondrial RNAs and slows mitochondrial transcription, effects that are quickly reversed with glucose reintroduction. Although transcriptomics revealed strong upregulation of the ISR, mitochondrial RNA stabilization was not upregulated by pharmacological activation of the ISR, but was promoted by inhibition of glycolysis, unveiling a direct connection between metabolism and regulation of mitochondrial gene expression.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Interpreting these systems through image segmentation requires the effective propagation and integration of information across different scales. However, most existing segmentation methods are optimised for single-scale imaging modalities, limiting their ability to capture and analyse small functional units throughout complete human organs. To facilitate multiscale biomedical image segmentation, we utilised Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT), an advanced imaging modality that can generate 3D multiscale datasets from high-resolution volumes of interest (VOIs) at ca. 1 m/voxel to whole-organ scans at ca. 20 m/voxel. Building on these hierarchical multiscale datasets, we developed a deep learning-based segmentation pipeline that is initially trained on manually annotated high-resolution HiP-CT data and then extended to lower-resolution whole-organ scans using pseudo-labels generated from high-resolution predictions and multiscale image registration. As a case study, we focused on glomeruli in human kidneys, benchmarking four 3D deep learning models for biomedical image segmentation on a manually annotated high-resolution dataset extracted from VOIs, at 2.58 to ca. 5 m/voxel, of four human kidneys. Among them, nnUNet demonstrated the best performance, achieving an average test Dice score of 0.906, and was subsequently used as the baseline model for multiscale segmentation in the pipeline. Applying this pipeline to two low-resolution full-organ data at ca. 25 m/voxel, the model identified 1,019,890 and 231,179 glomeruli in a 62-year-old donor without kidney diseases and a 94-year-old hypertensive donor, enabling comprehensive morphological analyses, including cortical spatial statistics and glomerular distributions, which aligned well with previous anatomical studies. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline for segmenting small functional units in multiscale bioimaging datasets and suggest its broader applicability to other organ systems.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

These responses are mediated by mechanosensory neurons distributed across the body, whose axons project into somatotopically organized brain regions corresponding to body location. How mechanosensory neurons interface with brain circuits to transform mechanical stimulations into location-appropriate behavior is unclear. We previously described the somatotopic organization of bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) around the Drosophila head that elicit a sequence of location-aimed grooming movements (Eichler et al., 2024). Here, we use a serial section electron microscopy reconstruction of a full adult fly brain to identify nearly all of BMN pre- and postsynaptic partners, uncovering circuit pathways that control head grooming. Postsynaptic partners dominate the connectome, and are both excitatory and inhibitory. We identified an excitatory hemilineage of cholinergic interneurons (hemilineage 23b) that elicit aimed head grooming and exhibit varied connectivity to BMNs from different head locations, revealing lineage-based development of a somatotopic parallel circuit architecture. Presynaptic partners provide extensive BMN presynaptic inhibition, consistent with models of sensory gain control as a mechanism of suppressing grooming movements and controlling the sequence. This work provides the first comprehensive map of a somatotopically organized connectome, and reveals how this organization could shape grooming. It also reveals the mechanosensory interface with the brain, illuminating fundamental features of mechanosensory processing, including feedforward excitation and inhibition, feedback inhibition, somatotopy based circuit organization, and developmental origins.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Being able to identify and improve the management of those who may be at risk requires robust screening methods. The use of circulating molecular markers provides a promising and non-invasive solution to this problem to allow necessary and successful intervention. The role of inflammation has been continuously demonstrated to play a key role in the onset of sPTB with intrauterine inflammation being a key driver. Here we sought out to explore the inflammatory proteome using a nested case-control approach using samples from pregnant participants in the INSIGHT cohort.\n\nObjectivesTo explore the maternal blood proteome in the second trimester using the Olink Explore panel to identify inflammatory proteins associated with sPTB and assess their predictive value, both independently and in combination with cell-free RNA (cfRNA).\n\nStudy DesignWe conducted a nested case-control study to investigate inflammatory protein profiles during the second trimester of pregnancy. A total of 138 maternal blood plasma samples were analyzed using a targeted proteomic assay quantifying 384 inflammation-related proteins. Differential expression analysis and a LASSO-logistic regression model with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) were applied to evaluate the association between inflammatory biomarkers and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) outcomes.\n\nResultsUsing predictive modelling of the maternal blood proteome, 16 inflammation-related proteins were identified as key discriminators of sPTB risk, with proteins such as PGF, COL9A1, CST7, CXCL6 and GALNT3 emerging as major contributors for predicting sPTB risk. Using inflammation-related maternal proteins alone to predict sPTB (<35 weeks) achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66-0.84). The incorporation of both cfRNA and proteomic data into an integrated model, improved the area under the curve to 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78-0.92). The integrated model highlighted inflammatory biomarkers that are not only implicated in preterm birth but also in essential physiological mechanisms such as placental function, tissue remodelling, and extracellular matrix composition, which are critical to maintaining pregnancy and preventing premature labour.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that an integrated approach using both cfRNA and proteomic signatures of the second trimester maternal blood plasma yields a more comprehensive biomarker profile for predicting preterm birth risk. This multimodal strategy not only enhances the predictive accuracy but also captures a broader array of biological signals across multiple organ systems. Compared to relying solely on inflammatory proteome markers, this multiomic method offers a deeper molecular characterisation of preterm birth risk in the maternal blood plasma.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

In glucose-limited niches, it utilizes alternative carbon sources such as carboxylic acids, which may influence its pathogenicity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the uptake of monocarboxylates occurs through regulated plasma membrane (PM) transport proteins, such as Ato1 (Ady2), which belongs to the Acetate Uptake Transporter (AceTr) family. In C. albicans, these proteins are notably expanded, consisting of ten Ato-like proteins (ATO1-ATO10), whose functions remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Ato proteins in carboxylic acid utilization by C. albicans using in-silico and functional analysis. Our data revealed that several C. albicans Atos retain conserved AceTr motifs but possess distinct structural features, including differences in pore radius and binding sites for acetate and lactate. Expression analysis revealed that Ato1, Ato2, Ato3, and Ato6 exhibit distinct cellular localization and expression levels on the plasma membrane, depending on the presence or absence of monocarboxylates. Remarkably, deletion of ATO1 impaired ATO2 and ATO3 expression and caused ER retention of a distinct form of Ato2, suggesting a central regulatory role for Ato1 in the Ato transport system. Finally, we identified a novel Ato-related protein family in vertebrates. This family has three consecutive 6-helix transport domains and a unique C-terminal fusion with Sua5/YciO/YrdC, an enzyme involved in tRNA modification. Overall, our data suggests that the Ato protein family might play a critical role in the utilization of acetic or lactic acids in C. albicans. It also proposes potential functional redundancy among its members, which may contribute to rapid environmental adaptation and pathogenicity.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Here we used a corneal suture model to induce epithelial damage, sustained inflammation and neovascularization, to examine the impact on LSCs. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we analyzed corneal cell state changes and additionally evaluated the potential of duloxetine, an FDA-approved medicine, to promote wound healing and corneal homeostasis. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed loss of homeostatic limbal stem cells, basal and differentiated epithelial cells and an increase in distinct limbal-like, conjunctival, inflammatory, and vascular cell states, suggesting a coordinated wound healing response in different tissue layers. Importantly, duloxetine treatment promoted epithelial homeostasis, enhanced stem cell-like and stromal repair processes, and suppressed immune and vascular responses.

In order to elucidate the mechanism by which all Tec kinases are regulated by PIP3, we studied an ancestral Tec kinase from the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. Here, we demonstrate that PIP3relieves autoinhibition of MbTec by displacing its PH domain from an inhibitory interaction with its kinase domain. Unexpectedly, we found that a conserved polyproline motif within MbTec promotes its activation in a kinase-intrinsic mechanism. Finally, we show that the PH domain is sufficient to restore autoinhibition in a constitutively active mutant of MbTec.

A recent discovery of a multi-subunit insertase in eukaryotes has raised the question about the architecture of the putative bacterial ortholog SecYEG-YidC and its functional mechanism. Here, we combine cryogenic electron microscopy with cell-free protein synthesis in nanodiscs to visualize biogenesis of the polytopic membrane protein NuoK, the subunit K of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, that requires both SecYEG and YidC for insertion. We demonstrate that YidC is recruited to the back of the translocon at the late stage of the substrate insertion, in resemblance to the eukaryotic system, and in vivo experiments indicate that the complex assembly is vital for the cells. The nascent chain does not utilize the lateral gate of SecYEG, but enters the lipid membrane at the SecYE-YidC interface, with YidC being the primary insertase. SecYEG-YidC complex promotes folding of the nascent helices at the interface prior their insertion, so the examined cellular pathway follows the fundamental thermodynamic principles of membrane protein folding.

While previous studies have shown that organic cosolvents influence these parameters, we now demonstrate that similar effects occur upon addition of water-miscible ionic liquids (ILs). In this study, six ThDP-dependent enzymes were analyzed in the presence of 14 ILs under comparable conditions to assess their influence on enzymatic carboligation reactions yielding 2-hydroxy ketones. ILs exerted a moderate to strong influence on activity and, more notably, altered enantioselectivity. (R)-selective reactions were generally stable upon IL addition, while (S)-selective reactions frequently showed reduced selectivity or even inversion to the (R)-enantiomer. The most significant change was observed for the ApPDC_E469G variant of pyruvate decarboxylase from Acetobacter pasteurianus, where the enantiomeric excess shifted from 86% (S) to 60% (R) in the presence of 9% (w/v) Ammoeng 102. Control experiments indicated that this shift was primarily due to the Ammoeng cation rather than the anion. To explore the molecular basis of this phenomenon, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on wild-type ApPDC and the E469G variant in Ammoeng 101 and Ammoeng 102. The simulations revealed that hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of the Ammoeng cations interact with the (S)-selective binding pocket, thereby favoring formation of the (R)-product.

NHEJ is capable of repairing a variety of damaged DNA, employing various accessory end-processing factors to resolve chemically blocked ends, trim overhangs, and fill gaps in order to achieve directly ligatable DNA ends. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying end-processing, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the NHEJ specific polymerase Pol {lambda} bound to the short-range synaptic complex, uncovering the mode of its recruitment to the complex as well as a putative model for its activity. Furthermore, the coordinated end-processing activities of the short-range (SR) synaptic complex simultaneously bound by both Pol {lambda} and PNKP, another accessory factor, demonstrates the ability of NHEJ to form large, multifunctional repair complexes capable of processing a variety of different DNA end structures to effect repair.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

This deterioration was robustly and significantly ameliorated by IN-DAN treatment by 90% (P<0.0001).

The aestivation in CSFB is characterized by metabolic suppression, cessation of feeding, and reproductive activities. Previous investigations have employed RNA-seq to explore gene expression changes associated with aestivation, providing initial insights into the molecular pathways. However, studies assessing proteomic changes during aestivation in this species and insects more broadly have been lacking. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis of adult CSFB at four time points: pre-aestivation (day 5), aestivation initiation (day 15), aestivation maintenance (day 30), and post-aestivation (day 55), to investigate proteomic changes associated with aestivation. We found that proteins related to the central dogma decreased in abundance, and metabolism-related proteins were altered during the initiation of aestivation. The proteomic changes during aestivation were minor and included reduction in mitochondrial proteins. Notably, the proteolysis-related proteins were enriched at the termination of aestivation. Interestingly, we observed discrepancies between our previous RNA-seq results and the proteomic data, particularly in the genes that increased in abundance during aestivation compared to post-aestivation. This highlights the importance of proteomic analysis for a more complete understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying aestivation. Body composition measurements showed that triglyceride and chitin levels peaked, while ATP and glucose were depleted during aestivation, following the changes in proteins belonging to different biological pathways.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we tested how single 30-minute sessions of cue-paced motor skill and isometric resistance training modulate corticospinal, reticulospinal, and spinal excitability in unimpaired adults (N = 23). Using motor-evoked potentials via transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that both training types increased corticospinal excitability, with more substantial effects following motor skill training. In contrast, reticulospinal tract excitability--assessed by StartReact responses--and spinal excitability--assessed by H/M ratios, F-wave response amplitude, and persistence--remained largely unchanged. These results suggest that short-term training selectively enhances corticospinal tract excitability without a measurable impact on spinal or reticulospinal circuits. This pathway-specific response may inform strategies for targeting neural plasticity in rehabilitation.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

R.; Engel, A. K.", "abstract": "BACKGROUNDOur representation of time is embedded within multisensory perception, based on sight, sound, or touch. However, despite being a crucial aspect of daily life, the neural dynamics of cross-modal temporal predictions remain elusive. The objective of this study was to investigate neural correlates of tactile-to-visual influences on temporal prediction using magnetencephalography (MEG). We hypothesized to observe increased inter-trial phase consistency (ITPC) in the low-frequency delta range (0.5-4 Hz) due to their involvement in temporal prediction. In addition, stronger ITPC values should correlate with a steeper slope of the psychometric function, indicating phase alignments as a likely cause of more consistent temporal predictions.\n\nMETHODSThe study was conducted within one MEG session employing a modified version of the time prediction task by Roth et al. [2013] and Daume et al. [2021]. Participants (N=23) observed a visual stimulus moving towards an occluder. Shortly before reaching the occluder, the visual stimulus faded in luminance to make the visual offset less informative. Instead, participants received a brief tactile stimulus to the ipsilateral hand at the time point of disappearance, generating a temporal expectation regarding its reappearance on the opposite side of the occluder. After variable time intervals, a visual stimulus reappeared, and participants had to indicate whether this was too early or too late compared to the movement before disappearance. A non-predictive control condition involved participants judging the variable luminance of the reappearing visual stimulus compared to its initial luminance at the beginning of the trial. Psychometric curves were fitted to the behavioral data of each participant and condition, and MEG recordings were analyzed using time-frequency representations obtained by wavelet convolution. To compare spectral power and ITPC estimates between conditions within frequency bands showing significant differences to the pre-stimulus baseline, we used cluster-based permutation statistics. Pearsons correlations were used to examine the relationship between ITPC or power estimates and the steepness of each participants psychometric function.\n\nRESULTSITPC analysis revealed strong increases in the delta range around stimulus disappearance and reappearance. Delta ITPC was significantly stronger during temporal prediction compared to the control condition. Only delta ITPC, but not delta power, correlated with the consistency of temporal prediction. Furthermore, temporal prediction led to increased alpha power in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as the right superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus, whereas beta power did not show differences between conditions.\n\nCONCLUSIONOur findings suggest that increased delta ITPC is likely caused by phase resets driven by the temporal prediction process rather than evoked neural activity. Furthermore, our findings indicate that phase alignments occur during crossmodal visuo-tactile-to-visual temporal predictions, even with a combination of non-rhythmic and discrete stimulation. This highlights the broad applicability of phase resets of neural oscillations as a mechanism for predicting timing across various types of stimuli.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

The compartment that is unique for neurons and crucial for neuron-neuron signaling is the synapse. Another compartment, that neurons share with all other cells in the body, is the primary cilium. The primary cilium is a solitary organelle, present in almost every neuronal cell type, that extends into the extracellular space for detection of signals. Several GPCRs have been identified as ciliary receptors, and here we show that the metabotropic GABA receptor subtype 1 localizes to primary cilia of neurons across different regions of the mouse brain and that activation of these receptors initiates Ca2+ signaling that is restricted to this organelle. The excitatory nature of GABAergic signaling in primary cilia is opposite to GABA action in other neuronal domains, indicating distinct modes of action of this universal inhibitory neurotransmitter even within the same neuron.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Upon activation of the IFN-{beta} induction pathway, TBK1-adaptor proteins (NAP1, SINTBAD, TANK) form condensates with liquid properties. We showed that NAP1 condensates concentrate TBK1. Using NAP1KO cell lines, we discovered that NAP1 exerts a dual effect on TBK1 activity. Initially, NAP1 binds TBK1 and increases its activity, which enhances the activation of the IFN pathway. Then, phosphorylation of NAP1 by TBK1 induces the formation of NAP1 condensates. These condensates concentrate TBK1 and PP2A, a phosphatase known to dephosphorylate and consequently deactivate TBK1, thus limiting IFN induction. Additionally, in patients with lupus or interferonopathies, we identified NAP1 variants, unable to form condensates upon cell exposure to danger signals, which can only activate TBK1 without limiting its activity. This study reveals an original mode of regulating a signaling pathway by formation of condensates and provides a molecular explanation for certain interferonopathies.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding could complement IBIs by increasing detection sensitivity for rare taxa while also reducing monitoring costs. To date, no studies have examined the efficacy of using eDNA metabarcoding to calculate IBIs in the US. Here, we used eDNA metabarcoding to calculate a fish-based IBI for streams and rivers of the Tennessee River Basin in northern Alabama, US. We collected water samples from 50 stream and river sites across a gradient of land use intensity, extracted eDNA from these samples, and sequenced the eDNA using vertebrate-specific primers. We compared our eDNA-IBI to a previous fish-IBI implemented by the state of Alabama using conventional sampling, as well as predicted biological condition of these streams from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on a benthic macroinvertebrate multi-metric index (BMMI). We found a highly significant, positive relationship between the eDNA-IBI and fish-IBI for the same streams but a weaker, non-significant positive relationship between the eDNA-IBI and BMMI. Notably, the former was recovered despite eDNA-IBI sampling being conducted nine years after the conventional fish sampling at slightly different locations, the fish-IBI having used greater sampling effort throughout the year (including spring and autumn rather than only summer sampling), and a lack of reference DNA sequences that prevented eDNA detection for some species detected by conventional fish sampling. Accordingly, our study provides a baseline for how an eDNA-IBI may work relative to multi-metric indices calculated from conventional sampling, which can be improved through future directions identified and discussed in our paper.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

We found that oxidative stress downregulates intermolecular base pairing of a reporter mRNA engineered to enhance detection of such interactions. Consistently, crosslinking-dependent intermolecular base pairing was not readily detected among candidate mRNAs that accumulate in stress granules - RNA-rich condensates that form during stress. Furthermore, chemical probing of base accessibility revealed that while RNA regions within these transcripts remain structured during stress, they increase in structural diversity in a manner dependent on oxidative stress and the stress granule nucleating proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2. This enhanced structural heterogeneity may help reduce a sustained exposure of interaction-prone RNA sequences during stress such as those prone to crosslinking. We propose that the combined downregulation of intermolecular base pairing and increased RNA structural diversity provides a mechanism to preserve normal function of RNAs during stress, while simultaneously enabling the reversible assembly of stress granules.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

L.; Dickinson, B.; Yang, K.-C.; Fang, Y.", "abstract": "BACKGROUNDInternal N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is a recently identified chemical modification of mammalian mRNA and a component of the epitranscriptome. While the epitranscriptome plays a key role in regulating RNA metabolism and cellular function, the specific contribution of internal m7G to cardiovascular health and disease remains unknown. Atherosclerosis preferentially develops at sites where disturbed blood flow activates endothelial cells, but whether internal m7G and its regulatory machinery influence endothelial mechanotransduction and atherogenesis is unclear.\n\nMETHODSWe integrated epitranscriptomic profiling, human tissue analysis, genetically modified mouse models, and targeted nanomedicine approaches to investigate the role of Methyltransferase-like protein 7A (METTL7A), a putative internal m7G methyltransferase, in regulating the flow-sensitive endothelial transcriptome and atherosclerosis. Vascular endothelial cells were subjected to well-defined athero-protective and athero-prone flow waveforms in vitro and in vivo. METTL7A function was assessed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), crosslinking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq), RNA stability assays, and a CRISPR-Cas-inspired RNA targeting system (CIRTS). METTL7A expression in human coronary arteries with and without atherosclerosis was evaluated by RNA-seq and immunostaining. In vivo atherosclerosis studies were conducted in both global and endothelial-specific Mettl7a1 knockout mice. Endothelial METTL7A expression was restored using cationic polymer-based nanoparticles delivering CDH5 promoter-driven METTL7A plasmids or VCAM1-targeted lipid nanoparticles delivering N1-methylpseudouridine (m{superscript 1}{Psi})-modified METTL7A mRNA.\n\nRESULTSAthero-protective unidirectional flow significantly induced METTL7A expression, which promoted internal m7G methylation of endothelial transcripts, while other major epitranscriptomic marks and cap-associated m7G were not affected by METTL7A. METTL7A preferentially binds to AG-enriched motifs in protein-coding mRNAs and plays a key role in regulating KLF4 and NFKBIA transcripts, enhancing their internal m7G and stability and supporting vascular homeostasis. In contrast, endothelial METTL7A expression was significantly reduced by disturbed blood flow and in human atherosclerotic lesions. Global or endothelial-specific loss of METTL7A exacerbated disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis in mice, independent of serum lipid levels. Restoration of endothelial METTL7A, via nanoparticle-mediated plasmid or m1{Psi} mRNA delivery, markedly reduced lesion formation in Mettl7a1-/- and ApoE-/- mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThese findings establish METTL7A as a previously unrecognized mechanosensitive methyltransferase that maintains endothelial homeostasis by stabilizing key anti-inflammatory transcripts, KLF4 and NFKBIA, through internal m7G methylation. Loss of METTL7A disrupts endothelial function and accelerates atherogenesis in response to disturbed flow. Therapeutic restoration of endothelial METTL7A, via targeted nanoparticle-mediated gene or m1{Psi} mRNA delivery, significantly lessens atherosclerosis. Collectively, these results uncover a novel epitranscriptomic mechanism governing vascular health and position METTL7A as a promising target for precision nanomedicine in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

{"title": "Off target: herbicides applied in cereal fields exclude non-competitive species, while replacing them by competitive weeds.", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.21.654858", "authors": "Humann-Guilleminot, S.; Bretagnolle, V.; Gaba, S.", "abstract": "Weed diversity plays an important role in maintaining resilient agroecosystems, yet agricultural practices, such as pesticide applications, significantly shape weed communities. Previous studies have primarily focused on comparing organic and conventional farming, with a particular emphasis on land-use intensification, with less attention on the impact of pesticides. Our study examined the impact of herbicide, fungicide, and insecticide use - both in terms of Treatment Frequency Index (TFI), i.e. intensity of application, and quantity - on weed communities in 96 non-organic cereal fields over 4 years. Interestingly, our results indicate that fungicide application intensity decreased weed abundance by 11.6% and species richness by 14.6% for each one-standard-deviation (1-SD) increase in TFI, whereas the total quantity applied (QA) did not. In contrast, for herbicides, QA had a stronger negative impact on weed communities than TFI, with a 14.3% decrease in weed abundance and a 12.4% decrease in species richness for each 1-SD increase in QA. This suggests that TFI of fungicide, which may reflect low-dose but frequent applications, could exert indirect and long-term effects on weed suppression, potentially by altering symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. In comparison, QA of herbicide more directly reflects the toxic load delivered to weeds and is therefore a better predictor of their suppression. Based on a combination of multivariate and univariate analyses and the study of underlying mechanisms in community changes, our results reveal that herbicides are the main factor shaping weed communities by decreasing the abundance of non-target/non-competitive species while replacing them by problematic, competitive to crops, weed species. These findings point out the potential ineffectiveness of herbicides application on problematic weeds and emphasize the need to reconsider the use of herbicides to maintain weed diversity in agricultural landscapes.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

The microcephaly genes are parts of essential cellular pathways but are regulated differently in both forms of microcephaly. These genes have diverged from single ancestral genes in to related but different gene paralogues during evolution. It is suggested that the paralogues might be redundant in other body organs and might rescue any abnormality in case of MCPH but not in Seckel syndrome. The important aspect is to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of these genes together with their paralogues at mRNA level where the different tissues of embryos might exhibit different transcript variants or different levels of the various transcript variants to find the complementation in case of the MCPH but divergence in case of the Seckel syndrome. Here, we studied Cdk5Rap2-Pde4dip, Phc1-Phc3 (for MCPH) and Cep63-Ccdc67 (for Seckel) in the embryonic mice tissues via RT-PCR throughout the peak of neurogenesis from E12.5 to E18.5. We found already known and novel transcript variants in the tissues in addition to different levels of expression proving differential regulation. The results of PCR were analysed on the agarose gel and were quantified by giving relative intensity percentage scores to each bands. Our data, shows that Cdk5Rap2-Pde4dip showed up-regulation at mid-late neurogenesis and showed redundancy whereas Cep63-Ccdc67 duo was very different and expression of Cep63 was consistent throughout neurogenesis, but Ccdc67 gradually increased during development and was highest at the late neurogenesis and development suggestive of diverged and essential roles of the two genes which are both essential in development and lastly, Phc1-Phc3 showed up-regulation at early and late neurogenesis and seem to have complementary roles in brain development. The expression profiles of Cep63-Ccdc67 were very different indicative of their diverged roles in development but the MCPH genes and their paralogues followed complementary patterns suggestive of complementation in brain development.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Traditional hermetic packaging methods become impractical as implant sizes decrease, necessitating alternative methods of protection from body fluids. This study evaluates the long-term stability of silicone-encapsulated CMOS ICs through accelerated life testing using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and visual inspection. CMOS interdigitated combs (IDCs) were encapsulated in medical grade silicone rubber, subjected to immersion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and tested at elevated temperatures (47{degrees}C, 67{degrees}C, and 87{degrees}C) under both 5V DC and biphasic voltage biases for up to 4.3 years.\n\nRemarkably, no insulation failures were observed in the IDCs, with no significant water ingress detected through impedance changes. Failures at the ICs were limited to wire bond open-circuits, though there was some pad discolouration/corrosion. Other failures were elsewhere, not at the ICs. This highlights the stability of modern silicon oxide/silicon nitride bilayer passivation when encapsulated in adhesive silicone rubber. Visual analysis revealed occasional solder and aluminium pad corrosion, particularly at higher temperatures, but these changes did not correlate with EIS failures. The findings suggest that silicone encapsulation, combined with passivation and shielding strategies, enables long-term IC reliability in biofluid environments.\n\nTo our knowledge, this paper presents the longest reported accelerated ageing study of test structures for implantable devices, laying the groundwork for the integration of silicone-encapsulated ICs into next-generation chip-scale bioelectronic implants.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

G.; Dickinson, M. S.; Myasnikov, A.; Echeverria, I.; Stroud, R. M.", "abstract": "Peroxisomes are eukaryotic oxidative organelles involved in numerous metabolic functions that include fatty acid oxidation, bile acid synthesis, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. ATP-binding cassette transporters of the D subfamily (ABCD1-3) mediate the import of CoA thioesters of fatty acids into the peroxisome. ABCD3, the most abundant of these transporters in the peroxisomal membrane, facilitates the transport of a broad spectrum of substrates including branched-chain fatty acids, very long-chain fatty acids, bile salt intermediates, and dicarboxylic acids. Mutations in ABCD3 are associated with defects in congenital bile acid synthesis and variants of Zellweger syndrome. The structural and functional details of the human ABCD3 transporter remain unclear, despite its significance. In this study, we report the cryogenic sample electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of full-length human ABCD3 in its apo state and bound to one of the physiological substrates (phytanoyl-CoA) at resolutions of 3.33 [A] and 3.13 [A], respectively. Our biochemical assays reveal that substrate binding induces ATPase activity in ABCD3, suggesting a substrate-dependent conformational change. Structural comparison of the apo and substrate bound states demonstrate that the substrate interaction brings nucleotide-binding domains closer, providing a mechanistic basis of substrate induced ATPase activity. These findings offer critical insights into the transport mechanism of ABCD3 and lay a structural foundation for understanding its role in peroxisomal metabolite import and related diseases.\n\nSignificance StatementPeroxisomes are involved in essential cellular metabolic processes that include fatty acid oxidation, bile acid synthesis, and detoxification. The ABCD subfamily of membrane transporter proteins transport fatty acyl-CoA molecules from the cytosol into peroxisomes. Among the ABCD subfamily members, ABCD3 transports branched chain fatty acids and a range of other important metabolites. Dysfunction in ABCD3 has been associated with several inherited and acquired diseases. Using cryo-EM, we determined high-resolution structures of full-length human ABCD3 in both unbound and phytanoyl-CoA-bound forms. We show that substrate binding stimulates ATP hydrolysis activity by apposition of the two nucleotide binding domains of ABCD3, adding structural insight into the mechanism of action of ABCD3 and its role in peroxisomal function and disease.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether controlled delivery of immunomodulatory factors would allow MSCs to simultaneously undergo osteogenic differentiation and modulate inflammation. We first used a Design of Experiments approach to identify the type and concentrations of immunomodulatory factors (IMFs) that most effectively induce concurrent pro-regenerative macrophages and MSC osteogenic differentiation, then loaded these IMFs into polymeric microparticles for controlled release. Through our in vitro models, we demonstrated that microparticles releasing IL-10 and IL-4 promote naive MSC osteogenesis and modulate immune response, even in chronic, physiologically relevant, inflammatory conditions. We then applied this approach to an in vivo rat model of ONJ as a clinically relevant example of such conditions. We observed clinically relevant sex-based differences in inflammation and bone formation that have not yet been reported.

Despite their importance, the mechanistic underpinnings of DNA conformational dynamics that facilitate PTF-nucleosomal interactions remain elusive. To address this, we present the first large-scale, systematic investigation dissecting the role of DNA flexibility in defining transcription factor (TF) binding specificity in-vitro and in-vivo within nucleosomal DNA. Integration of high-throughput datasets with empirically derived DNA flexibility descriptors obtained DNA flexibility-augmented statistical regression models that highlight the relative contribution and mechanistic relevance of bending, torsional, and stretching flexibilities in predicting the nucleosomal DNA binding affinities of 194 TFs. Our findings also suggested that \"DNA flexibility gradient\" along nucleosomal substrate might be a key element to PTF-mediated nucleosome destabilization. Integrative modeling of DNA flexibility with in-vivo genomic occupancy, and chromatin accessibility data reveals that established PTFs, GATA3 and the pluripotency factors(OCT4, SOX2, and KLF), likely exploits the differential DNA flexibility signatures observed in the pioneered sites to remodel the closed chromatin. Finally, by proposing a robust computational framework, we demonstrate that sequence-encoded DNA structural descriptors are key determinants for accurately identifying functional PTF binding sites across diverse cellular contexts. In summary, our study highlights DNA conformational flexibility as a critical and previously under appreciated regulatory layer in eukaryotic gene regulation mediated by the PTFs--advancing our understanding of the interplay between DNA structural dynamics, chromatin organization, and transcriptional control.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Valid, low burden, multivariate molecular approaches to assess circadian phase at scale in people living and working in the real-world hold promise for translating basic circadian knowledge to practical applications. However, standards for the development and evaluation of these circadian biomarkers have not yet been established, even though several publications report such biomarkers and claim that the methods are universal. Here we present a basic exploration of some of the determinants and confounds of blood-based biomarker development for SCN phase by reanalysing publicly available data sets. We compare performance of biomarkers based on three feature selection methods: Partial Least Squares Regression, ZeitZeiger and Elastic Net, as well as performance of a standard set of clock genes. We explore the effects of training sample size and the impact of the experimental protocols from which training samples are drawn and on which performance is tested. Approaches based on small sample sizes used for training are prone to poor performance due to overfitting. Performance to some extent depends on the feature selection method, but at least as much on the experimental conditions from which the biomarker training samples were drawn. Performance of biomarkers developed under baseline conditions do not necessarily translate to protocols that mimic real world scenarios such as shiftwork in which sleep may be restricted or desynchronised from endogenous circadian SCN phase. The molecular features selected by the various approaches to develop biomarkers for SCN phase show very little overlap, although the processes associated with these features have common themes with response to steroid hormones, i.e. cortisol being the most prominent. Overall, the findings indicate that establishment of circadian biomarkers should be guided by established biomarker development concepts and foundational principles of human circadian biology.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that -mycolic acids adopt extended conformations to stabilize bilayers, with a phase transition near 338 K that underscores their thermal resilience. Lipids in the outer leaflet such as PDIM and PAT induce membrane heterogeneity, migrating to the interleaflet space and reducing lipid order. The simulated mycobacterial outer membrane has ordered inner leaflets and disordered outer leaflets, which contrasts with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

To quantify this heterogeneity at the neurofunctional level, we analyzed resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in a large sample (n = 33,180) from the UK Biobank dataset. Using machine learning regression analysis, we identified RSFC patterns associated with item-level responses from the neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. The pattern of RSFC associations across questionnaire items reflected genetically defined clusters (Worry and Depressed Affect), showing a significant correlation (r = 0.767, p < 0.001).

C.-H.; Chin, J.; Knudsen, B.; Trevathan, J.; Shoffstall, A.; Ludwig, K.", "abstract": "IntroductionElectrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) is an FDA approved therapy for epilepsy, depression and rehabilitation after stroke, with recent clinical trials to treat heart failure and inflammation. VNS is often assumed to activate either parasympathetic efferents projecting to visceral organs, and/or sensory afferents projecting from these organs, for its therapeutic effects. Recent studies in humans, swine and dogs have shown that sympathetic nerve fibers from the sympathetic trunk (ST) can frequently be found within the cervical vagus nerve (VN). However, the prevalence and functional consequence of sympathetic fibers on VNS have yet to be elucidated in the most common high throughput animal model to study disease, the rodent.\n\nMethodsWe carefully traced ST from sympathetic cervical ganglion (SCG) to find its location in the carotid sheath with reference to the VN in a cohort of Long Evans rats. We then assessed the prevalence of ST fibers with the cervical VN across the cohort using microCT and immunohistochemistry. Finally, we stimulated the VN and the ST in isolation, and where they were conjoined, to evaluate the ST contribution to changes in heart rate. VNS induced heart rate changes are a commonly used surrogate for changes in sympathetic/parasympathetic tone.\n\nResultsThe ST frequently runs in very close proximity to the VN in rats when traced caudally from the SCG. The ST is even conjoined with the VN for stretches within the carotid sheathe at the most common location to place an epineural cuff. Cross-connecting branches were found between the ST and the VN.\n\nVNS performed at locations where there was minimal ST crossover induced dose-dependent bradycardia (decrease in heart rate) across the cohort, with detectable bradycardia across the cohort beginning at 50 A (n=8 right, n=3 left). Conversely, stimulation of the isolated ST induced tachycardia (increase in heart rate) across the cohort beginning at [~]200 A (n=7 right, n=3 left).\n\nConclusionThese data suggest that studies of VNS in the rodent model may also be stimulating sympathetic fibers from the ST in addition to canonical VN pathways.

The fruit fly Drosophila has provided a powerful model to dissect the mechanisms by which reward-encoding DANs mediate reward learning. However, the role of these DANs in regulating innate behaviors is less clear. Here, we show that activating the entire population of reward-encoding DANs in Drosophila drives innate aversion in multiple behavioral assays, including feeding, locomotion, and spatial preference, even as these neurons confer a positive value onto associated cues to drive future learned attraction. Activating subsets of DANs reveals that the effects on innate and learned behaviors are dissociable. Based on known circuitry, it is likely that innate aversion and learned attraction elicited by DANs arise from distinct effects - direct activation versus synaptic plasticity - on the same target neurons. These results reveal distinct roles for reward-encoding DANs in guiding immediate and future behavior.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

The subject case either matched the requirements of the verb in the critical stimuli, thereby rendering the sentence acceptable, or it violated the requirements of the verb, and thus rendering the sentence unacceptable. Both mental and physical experiencer verbs engendered negativity effects in the 400-600 ms time-window when the subject case did not match the verbs requirements. Additionally, mental experiencer verbs evoked a LAN-like effect in the same time window regardless of grammaticality.

The NAc-S is predominantly composed of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that express either the dopamine D1 (D1-SPNs) or the dopamine D2 receptor (D2-SPNs). Yet, the role of these two neuronal subpopulations and their inputs to the VP in stimulus-based decisions remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetics in female and male knock-in rats to selectively silence D1- or D2-SPNs and their projections to the VP at a time when the rats were required to use predictive stimuli to choose between two instrumental actions. Silencing either population of NAc-S SPNs disrupted choice. Silencing NAc-S D1-SPNs terminals in the VP also disrupted choice. However, choice was left intact by silencing NAc-S D2-SPNs terminals in the VP. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the cellular mechanisms and circuitry underlying stimulus-based decisions. We discuss how these insights are consistent with a recent model proposing that these decisions are controlled by an opioid-based memory system residing in the NAc-S.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

We identified robust hub architecture in the neonatal connectome and mapped these structural hubs to corresponding cortical regions in the Brain prenatal digital brain atlas. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential gene expression in network hubs prior to the time of birth, with genes positively associated with hub status supporting the establishment of early neuronal circuitry and predominantly expressed in the transient subplate and intermediate zones. Hub genes were expressed by excitatory neurons, including subplate neurons and intratelencephalic projection neurons in deep cortical layers, and overlapped with markers of cortical expansion and interhemispheric connectivity in adulthood.

Here, we address this open question by studying language evolution in the lab via iterated learning. Across two qualitatively different domains (colors and Shepard circles), we find that semantic systems evolve toward the theoretical limit of efficient lossy compression, and over time, converge to highly efficient systems. This provides direct evidence that adult learners may operate under a bias to maintain efficiently compressed semantic representations. Moreover, it demonstrates how this bias can be amplified by cultural transmission, leading to the evolution of information-theoretically optimal semantic systems.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Injury causes lifelong arm impairment in 30-40% of those affected, but the extent to which bone microstructure is affected and how that relates to bone morphology alterations is unclear. Additionally, how injury location impacts trabecular bone, and the role limb disuse plays in these differential effects are unknown. Using two rat models of BPBI (postganglionic and preganglionic) and a disuse model (disarticulation), trabecular bone microstructure and glenohumeral morphology were characterized in the proximal humerus and distal scapula. For bone microstructure, the regions closest to the joint articulating surface incurred the greatest detriments with the least robust trabecular bone. These trabecular bone deficits in the humeral epiphysis and scapular neck were greater following preganglionic injury than postganglionic injury. The effects in the disarticulation group tended to align more with those in the postganglionic group, and greater detriments were observed in the scapula than in the humerus. Bone morphology metrics were explained mainly by quantity and architecture of trabecular bone but were not explained by the same metrics across all groups. Combining results with changes in bone morphology, data suggest differential effects with injury location and the effects of limb disuse to be most prominent in the postganglionic injury group and the distal scapula. In addition, the differences in results between postganglionic and preganglionic and macrostructural and microstructural deformity, suggest different drivers for postganglionic and preganglionic injuries and different factors causing macrostructural and microstructural alterations.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Their detection represents a significant challenge due to their diversity, size, and enrichment in repetitive regions. With the use of high quality long-read technologies, the majority of these challenges can now be mitigated. However, many downstream applications ranging from clinical diagnostics and genome-wide association studies to large-scale aggregation of population variants continue to rely on short-read-sequencing data due to its high through-put and cost-effectiveness. Thus, the challenges of short-read sequencing SV detection remain a constant and relevant obstacle. We created dicast, a machine-learning method to improve the identification of true-positive SVs from short-read sequencing using genomic context and alignment features. Dicast is driven by a novel and comprehensive benchmark call-set created through the combination of several sequencing technologies and rigorous manual curation. This benchmark set served as the basis for a systematic evaluation of five sequencing platforms and fifteen SV detection methods across different SV classes, sizes, and genomic contexts, enabling us to quantify the strengths and weaknesses of each and inform the training of our model. Leveraging these insights, dicast outperforms state-of-the-art short-read-based callers and consensus approaches, identifying considerably more true-positive variants while maintaining a high precision. We also demonstrate the methods applicability in diagnostic scenarios using putative pathogenic candidates in a limb malformation cohort, as well as known pathogenic variants in atrial fibrillation and neuromuscular disease cohorts. Dicast identifies all known pathogenic variants and 20% more manually confirmed candidate deletions than a consensus approach, and therefore can be used to reliably reduce time-consuming manual inspection in diagnostics.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/655285v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d478aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13ef337org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d1cca0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d15099_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Protein functions are often associated with the presence of specific motifs, which are short amino acid sequences with a specific amino acid pattern.

To address this, we developed PMScanR, an R-based library that automates the prediction and evaluation of the impact of single amino acid substitutions on the occurrence of protein motifs in large datasets. In addition, existing tools do not support comparative analysis of multiple motifs across multiple sequences - a key feature that PMScanR was designed to provide.

The library offers multiple visualization tools, including heatmaps, sequence logos, and pie charts, enabling a deeper understanding of motif distribution and conservation. Through its integration with PROSITE, PMScanR provides access to up-to-date motif data, making it a valuable tool for biological and biomedical research, particularly in protein function annotation and therapeutic target identification.\n\nThe PMScanR library is freely available (GPL license) on Bioconductor.

Peroxisomes are lipid-metabolizing organelles that engage into various membrane contact sites with other organelles. Impaired peroxisomal metabolism has been associated with beta-cell apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion. How peroxisomes contribute to insulin and neuropeptide secretion is unknown. Here we demonstrate that peroxisomes interact with the Golgi apparatus in Drosophila insulin-producing cells. Secretion of insulin-like peptide 2 is cell-intrinsically impaired in mutants lacking the peroxisome assembly factor Pex19. Loss of peroxisomes shifts the profile of sphingolipids towards longer sphingoid bases and leads to accumulation of sphingolipids in the Golgi. We show that peroxisomes dynamically interact with the Golgi in insulin-producing cells and that Pex19 directly contributes to peroxisome-Golgi interaction via the fatty acyl-CoA reductase FAR2/waterproof in the peroxisomal membrane. We propose that this peroxisome-Pex19-Golgi axis is required to adjust Golgi membranes upon starvation by withdrawing lipids with longer side chains, thereby optimizing Golgi membrane flexibility for dense-core vesicle secretion upon refeeding.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

We show that male hybrids between D. simulans and D. mauritiana fail to properly express key Y-linked fertility genes. These genes contain unusually large introns, exceeding megabases and show substantial sequence divergence between species. In the hybrids, these gigantic introns are misprocessed, resulting in widespread splicing defects, including aberrant \"back-splicing\" events that join later exons to earlier ones. Our findings suggest that sequence divergence within introns can disrupt essential gene expression through defective splicing, providing a mechanistic link between rapid Y chromosome evolution and hybrid sterility.

These spectral signatures, in turn, precisely predict the networks emergent global dynamical regime, encompassing asynchronous states, synchronous states, oscillations, localized activity bumps, traveling waves, and chaos.

However, these approaches are limited by the difficulty in crystallization of biomolecules or by a low contrast that makes high-resolution measurements very challenging in crowded samples such as a cell membrane. The exquisite labeling specificity of fluorescence microscopy gets around these issues. Indeed, several recent reports have reached resolutions down to the [A]ngstrom level in super-resolution microscopy, but to date, these works used fixed samples. To establish light microscopy as a workhorse in structural biology, two main requirements must be fulfilled: near-native sample preservation and near-atomic optical resolution. Here, we demonstrate a technique that satisfies these key criteria with particular promise for conformational studies on membrane proteins and their complexes. To prepare cell membranes in their near-native state, we adapt established protocols from cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) for shock-freezing and transfer of samples. We developed a high-vacuum cryogenic shuttle system that allows us to transfer vitrified samples in and out of a liquid-helium cryostat that houses a super-resolution fluorescence microscope. Sample temperatures below 10 K help dissipate the heat from laser illumination, thus maintaining intact vitreous ice. We utilize the photoblinking of organic dye molecules attached to well-defined positions of a protein to localize one label fluorophore at a time. We present various characterization studies of the vitreous ice, photoblinking behavior, and the effects of the laser intensity. Moreover, we benchmark our method by demonstrating [A]ngstrom precision in resolving the full assembled configuration of the heptameric membrane protein alpha-hemolysin (HL) in a synthetic lipid membrane as a model system. Additionally, we report on the techniques capability to resolve membrane proteins in their native cellular membrane environment. Our method, which we term single-particle cryogenic light microscopy (spCryo-LM), enables structural studies of membrane protein tertiary and quaternary conformations without the need for chemical fixation or protein isolation. The approach can also integrate other super-resolution or spectroscopic techniques with particular promise in correlative microscopy with images from Cryo-EM and related techniques.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

C.; Ding, F.", "abstract": "Aberrant aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils is associated with numerous neurodegenerative, systemic and metabolic diseases. Amyloidogenic proteins undergo spontaneous liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), rapidly forming protein-rich condensates prior to fibrillization. However, the exact effects of LLPS on amyloid aggregation remain unclear as contrasting fibrillization-promotion, inhibition and even biphasic effects have been reported in the literature. In this study, we integrate LLPS-induced heterogeneity of protein concentrations into a thermodynamic-kinetic model of amyloid aggregation. We adopt the phase transition theory and introduce protein condensates as an additional protein state alongside non-interacting monomers, oligomers and fibrils. Oligomerization and fibrillization can occur both in the protein-rich condensates and the protein-poor solution. This model allows us to derive the time evolution of different states - monomers, condensates, oligomers, and fibrils - spanning a wide range of concentrations, and determine how model parameters related to LLPS, fibrillization, and oligomerization influence fibrillization kinetics. Using this global model, we resolve the seemingly contradictory effects of LLPS on fibrillization. We expect the developed thermodynamic-kinetic model of LLPS, and amyloid aggregation will help advance our understanding, modulation, and mitigation of pathological aggregation processes in amyloid diseases.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=62 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/655849v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f638cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10baef1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a52cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c2329a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Patients typically experience drug-resistant seizures and in cases with infantile onset, developmental regression can follow. KCNT1-related disorders include epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures and sleep related hypermotor epilepsy. There are currently no effective treatments for KCNT1-epilepsies, but suppressing over-active channels poses a potential strategy.\n\nMethodsUsing KCNT1 channel structural data, we in silico screened a library of known drugs for those predicted to block the channel pore to reduce the current amplitude and inhibit channel activity.\n\nResultsEight known drugs were investigated in vitro for their effects on patient-specific mutant KCNT1 channels, with four drugs showing significant reduction of K+ current amplitudes. The action of the four drugs was then analyzed in vivo and two were found to reduce the seizure phenotype in humanized Drosophila KCNT1-epilepsy models.\n\nInterpretationThis study identified two known drugs, antrafenine and nelfinavir mesylate, that reduce KCNT1 channel activity and reduce seizure activity in whole animals, suggesting their potential use as new treatments for KCNT1-epilepsy.

Despite decades of research, current AD treatments only manage symptoms without offering a cure. This study investigates the potential of edible birds nest (EBN) as a therapeutic intervention for mitigating cognitive decline in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced model of sporadic AD. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to seven groups: control, sham, STZ, low EBN (LEBN, 300 mg/kg), medium EBN (MEBN, 600 mg/kg), high EBN (HEBN, 1200 mg/kg), and memantine (MEM, 10 mg/kg). On day 1, rats received a 3 mg/kg intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of STZ and were allowed a 7-day recovery period. Following recovery, the rats were treated with their respective interventions daily via oral gavage for 21 days. Behavioral performance was assessed using the Open Field (OF), Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT), and Morris Water Maze (MWM). After behavioral testing, animals were euthanized, and hippocampal tissues were processed for Congo red staining, Bielschowsky staining, and immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of NR1, NR2A, NR2B, Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2). STZ-treated rats exhibited significant declines in recognition memory, spatial learning, and increased anxiety in the open field, along with elevated Congo red and Bielschowsky staining, and higher expression of N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits (NR1, NR2A, NR2B), GFAP, and EAAT2, indicative of astrogliosis and glutamate excitotoxicity. Treatment with MEBN (600 mg/kg) significantly improved exploratory behavior, memory, and cognition in the ICV-STZ rats. MEBN effectively attenuated cognitive decline and modulated hippocampal markers, yielding results comparable to the positive control, memantine. These findings underscore the potential of EBN as a promising therapeutic approach for AD and highlight the increasing relevance of traditional medicine in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we report on structural characterization of vaccine-elicited VRC01-class bnAb precursors in the IAVI G001 Phase 1 clinical trial with the eOD-GT8 60mer nanoparticle as immunogen. High-resolution X-ray structures of eOD-GT8 monomer complexed with Fabs of five VRC01-class bnAb precursors with >90% germline identity revealed a conserved mode of binding to the HIV CD4-binding site (CD4bs) via IGHV1-2-encoded heavy chains, mirroring mature bnAb interactions. The light-chain V-gene diversity emulated VRC01 bnAbs and stabilized antigen engagement, while their conserved five-residue LCDR3 motifs prevented steric clashes. Notably, the VRC01-class bnAb precursors accommodated the N276 glycan, a key barrier in HIV Env recognition, through structural rearrangements in HCDR3 or LCDR1, despite its absence in the immunogen. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis showed that 87% of elicited antibodies retained glycan binding capacity, albeit with reduced affinity. These findings validate the ability of eOD-GT8 60mer nanoparticles to prime VRC01-class bnAb precursors with native-like paratopes but with intrinsic glycan adaptability. Structural mimicry of mature bnAbs was observed even with limited somatic hypermutation, indicating that critical features are encoded in the germline repertoire. The structures highlight how germline-encoded features drive bnAb-like recognition at early stages. This work provides molecular evidence supporting germline-targeting in humans and provides guidance for designing booster immunogens to shepherd affinity maturation toward broad neutralization.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

In the absence of the Nanos2 gene (Nanos2-KO), germ cells fail to enter G0 arrest and initiate the male differentiation program (including DNA methylation and the piRNA pathway), ultimately undergoing apoptosis before birth. Nanos2 transcription begins at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and terminates at E15.5. However, as the NANOS2 protein continues to be stably expressed beyond E15.5, it is important to elucidate the function of NANOS2 during this post-E15.5 period in germ cell fate determination. To address the functional significance of sustained NANOS2 protein expression, we employed an auxin-inducible degron (AID2) system to achieve rapid degradation of NANOS2 after E15.5. Within 24 hours of 5-Ph-IAA administration, NANOS2 protein was efficiently depleted. As a result, germ cells resumed the cell cycle, exhibited aberrant gene expression patterns similar to Nanos2-KO gonocytes, and underwent apoptosis if NANOS2 depletion occurred at E15.5 or E16.5. Although some surviving cells initiated spermatogenesis and expressed PLZF and GFRA1 after birth, further spermatogenesis was not observed. These findings reveal that sustained NANOS2 protein expression during the embryonic stage is essential for establishing functional spermatogonial stem cells, highlighting a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism in male germ cell development.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

DC. (~65 species) distributed in tropical Asia to understand its uneven diversity in tropical Asia. Location: Tropical Asia Taxon: Miliusa (Annonaceae) Methods: Phylogenetic reconstruction was done using six plastid markers across 52 species using ML and BI approaches. Divergence time was estimated using two fossil calibrations and an optimised relaxed clock, and ancestral areas were inferred with BioGeoBEARS. Speciation rates were examined using ClaDS and the DR statistic, and the community structure was assessed using phylogenetic diversity metrics. Results: Miliusa likely originated in the mid-Miocene, with Indo-Burma and peninsular India (PI) as its ancestral range. Extant diversity is primarily attributed to in-situ speciation, with dispersal or vicariance playing limited but important roles in PI, and Wallacea and Sahul. Indo-Burman lineages began accumulating in the mid-Miocene in contrast to PI (~10 Myr) and Wallacea and Sahul (~5 Myr). PI shows signs of lineage saturation and had lower speciation rates than Wallacea and Sahul and Indo-Burma, which had similar rates. All regions exhibited phylogenetic clustering, but Indo-Burma and PI differed in sensitivity to phylogenetic depths. Main conclusions: The uneven diversity of Miliusa is shaped by time for speciation, age, and dispersal, although their relative influence varied across regions. In Indo-Burma, long-term geo-climatic stability and greater niche availability likely facilitated the persistence of lineages, rapid speciation, and dispersal, making it an evolutionary hotspot for Miliusa. In contrast, the PI had lower richness and speciation rates despite being older, due to contraction of wet habitats limiting the available niches for speciation. Lineages in Wallacea and Sahul show typical island-like radiations with speciation rates comparable to larger and more stable Indo-Burma, despite being young. Overall, our results highlight the role of Miocene-driven climatic vicariance and Pliocene-Pleistocene climatic fluctuations in shaping the diversification dynamics and diversity patterns in tropical Asia.

The mechanism by which the different molecules and photoreceptors influence targeted metabolite accumulation under different light regimes is not clear. In the present study, in-silico and systems biology-based analysis, HPLC and label-free comparative quantitative proteomics were employed to investigate the imperative effect of different illumination conditions on metabolite production. The results indicated that blue light substantially enhances the accumulation of astaxanthin and chlorophyll via the blue light-sensor (photoreceptor). Thus, it suggests that fine-tuned illumination conditions influence molecular components in specific metabolite production.

Seventy calves were enrolled in the acclimatization period (3 wk), after which 60 calves were selected based on their ability to use the automated feed bins (FB) and the GreenFeed system. These 60 calves were blocked in pairs for sex, breed, and BW, and within block randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments: a partially mixed ration (PMR) supplemented with (1) a placebo contrate (CTL), or with (2) a 3-NOP concentrate (on average 121 mg 3-NOP/kg dry matter of total ration). The acclimatization period was followed by a covariate period (2 wk) in which baseline measurements were performed, and afterwards the treatment period (12 wk) started where the calves received 1 of the 2 dietary treatments. Next to PMR, the calves received up to 1280 g/ day bait in the GreenFeed system, which was used for emission measurements. For analyses, all data was averaged for the covariate period and for different periods in the treatment wk: 1-3, 4-6, 7-9 and 10-12. Upon 3-NOP supplementation, CH4 production (g/d) was significantly reduced by 31.3% in wk 1 to 3, by 27.1% in wk 4 to 6, by 30.0% in wk 7 to 9, and by 30.7% in wk 10 to 12 compared to CTL, and CH4 intensity (g/kg BW) was significantly reduced by 30.0% in week 1 to 3, by 25.8% in wk 4 to 6, by 27.9% in wk 7 to 9, and by 28.6% in wk 10 to 12 compared to CTL. Overall, 3-NOP calves had a reduction of 29.8% for CH4 production, 19.4% for CH4 yield (g/kg dry matter intake; DMI), and 27.9% for CH4 intensity. Calves receiving 3-NOP had a lower total DMI (6.1 kg/d) compared to CTL (6.9 kg/d), driven by a lower DMI of PMR. In every period, calves in 3-NOP had a lower BW (overall: 251 kg) compared to CTL (overall: 258 kg). The 3-NOP group and the CTL group did not differ in initial BW, but calves in the 3-NOP group had a lower final BW (290 kg) compared to CTL (301 kg). Both feed to gain ratio and feed efficiency did not differ between the two treatment groups. It can be concluded that 3-NOP is a promising strategy to persistently decrease CH4 emission in growing beef calves from 5 to 8 mo of age, without negatively impacting feed efficiency.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

In this work, we introduce an extension to the GFA format that enables efficient grammar-based compression of haplotype paths while retaining human readability. In addition, grammar-based encoding provides an efficient in-memory data structure that does not require decompression, but conversely improves the runtime of many computational tasks that involve haplotype comparisons.

Changes in availability of molecular components can be anticipated for intracellular and prebiotic milieu, and protocells may have also faced fluctuations in salinity and pH. Compartments able to maintain their molecular composition, i.e. homeostasis, under such conditions would be better able to preserve internal functions. Phase separation could in principle provide resistance to local changes in molecular composition. To evaluate this possibility, we investigated the impact of non-stoichiometric charge ratios of coacervate molecules on coacervate formation and RNA compartmentalization in oligoarginine (R10)/ATP coacervates across salinity and pH conditions relatable to plausible prebiotic environments. These R10/ATP coacervate systems resisted changes in oligoarginine concentration in both phases under freshwater and ocean-relevant salt conditions, providing a primitive molecular buffering function. Moreover, RNA accumulation was observed in the coacervates over a range of pH, salinity, and R10/ATP stoichiometry. We also observed salt-dependent differences in molecular buffering and compartmentalization that can be understood in terms of how salinity impacts the relative strengths of intermolecular binding modes that drive coacervation and RNA uptake. By varying relative phase volumes and altering which intermolecular binding modes dominate, LLPS provides general mechanisms for resisting changes in molecular availability and environmental conditions, even without the active homeostasis of living cells. Such primitive molecular buffering could have aided the emergence of life and may find utility in biotechnological or commercial applications based on molecular compartmentalization.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Using a dataset of 118 diverse mAbs, we developed a physics-informed neural network (PINN) incorporating a two-compartment PK model. The four parameters of the PK model are predicted by a NN in which the numerical representation of the light and heavy chain sequences derived through sequence-attention and protein language model features serve as input. The model successfully predicted clearance and volume of distribution at steady state with remarkable accuracy, achieving predictions within 2-fold error for 10/13 and 13/13 mAbs in the test set, respectively. Concentration-time profiles were well-characterized with a median geometric mean fold error (GMFE) close to 2, with nearly 70% of predictions having GMFE less than 2.

A.; Hamid, J.; Kumar, A.; Rangamani, P.", "abstract": "The dynamics of calcium ions in skeletal muscles link electrochemical activation and contractile force generation. An improved quantitative understanding of the mechanisms by which calcium dynamics modulate force production is crucial for optimizing muscle performance. Recent experimental data suggest that store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), the process of extracellular calcium influx upon depletion of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), helps delay the onset of muscle fatigue. However, the mechanistic links between SOCE and sustained force generation in muscle remain unclear. We hypothesize that SOCE regulates force generation during sustained muscle activity by facilitating SR calcium store refilling. We test this hypothesis with a quantitative biophysical model that simulates the biochemical events of muscle contraction, from initial depolarization at the sarcolemma and T-tubules to calcium release from the SR to calcium binding and force generation throughout the myoplasm. We also consider the balance between calcium removal from the myoplasm and SOCE through the T-tubule membrane. We estimate free parameters in the model by fitting them to experiments that measured sarcolemma membrane voltage and myoplasmic calcium transients in single muscle fibers in vitro. We then test the effects of SOCE inhibition on calcium dynamics and force production and find that the magnitude of myoplasmic calcium and force are significantly lower than in wild-type cells over repetitive stimuli. Finally, we predict the effects of varying the degree of SOCE inhibition during patterns of stimulus chosen to mimic those observed during resistance exercise or high-intensity interval training. These simulations predict a context-dependent relationship between force generation and SOCE, wherein increased SOCE is associated with greater force production during resistance exercise, but worsens the effects of fatigue in certain cases of high-intensity training.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Background: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with proprioceptive impairments affecting up to 64% of survivors. These impairments hinder sensorimotor function and motor recovery, significantly impacting post-stroke disability and quality of life. Proprioception depends on an integrated network of brain regions but remains underexplored due to limitations in clinical assessments, making it difficult to identify precise links between stroke-related damage and functional deficits. To address this, we combined quantitative proprioceptive measurements with Connectome-based Lesion-Symptom Mapping (CLSM) to identify white matter (WM) disconnection patterns underlying proprioceptive deficits following sensorimotor stroke. Methods: In this observational study, we investigated the relationship between WM disconnection and proprioceptive deficits in 39 chronic stroke survivors with paretic arm function (>6 months post-stroke; 13 females; aged 35-81) using CLSM and kinematic assessments. Lesions were manually delineated from 3T MRI scans, and proprioception was quantified using the Arm Position Matching (APM) task on the KINARM Exoskeleton. Patient-specific voxel-wise WM disconnection maps were generated using the Tractography Lesion Assessment Standard (TractLAS), which quantifies disconnection relative to a healthy WM connectome. Proprioceptive scores were regressed against disconnection maps using voxel-wise linear regressions (family-wise error corrected, controlled for age and sex). Results: Our disconnectome-based approach identified a network of regions where proprioceptive deficits were significantly associated with WM disconnection (d = 0.55-1, p < .005 FWE, t = 3.48-6.35). These included tracts previously implicated in proprioceptive function (superior longitudinal fasciculus, middle longitudinal fasciculus, and arcuate fasciculus) and beyond (medial lemniscus, spinothalamic tract, posterior thalamic radiation). Conclusion: We provide evidence that post-stroke proprioceptive impairments arise from network-wide WM disconnection in several key tracts that mediate proprioceptive function. This study highlights the benefits of using CLSM to assess stroke-related proprioceptive deficits and offers a framework for network-informed assessments of functional impairments that can be used for targeted therapies post-stroke.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

In contrast, understanding of effects in cognitive brain areas, which potentially underpin more impactful effects of injury, remains limited. The current study addressed this limitation by using electroencephalography to index responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS-EEG) applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In 18 mTBI patients and 22 healthy controls, TMS-EEG was used to index cortical inhibition and long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity within DLPFC. These were assessed using paired-pulse TMS (short- [SICI] and long- [LICI] interval intracortical inhibition) and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), respectively. Functional effects of injury were assessed via the N-back and Trail Making Test. Responses were quantified in both temporal (i.e., TMS-evoked potentials; TEPs) and spectral (i.e., TMS-related oscillations; TROs) domains. For TEPs, measures of inhibition and plasticity both tended to be reduced by mTBI. In contrast, TRO data suggested a contradictory increased response of patients to both paired-pulse stimulation and cTBS that was specific to high-frequency bands. In addition, while TMT performance was reduced in the mTBI group, this was unrelated to neurophysiological effects of injury. These findings highlight novel effects of mTBI on DLPFC neurophysiology and emphasise the importance of considering both evoked and induced activity when examining neurophysiological effects of mTBI.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Using single cell RNA-sequencing, we show that commensal soil bacteria induce a Nod factor-independent transcriptional response in specific root hairs. This response is similar to the rhizobium response in the CSSP-deficient cyclops mutant, which is unable to accommodate rhizobia in root hair infection threads. Both responses include the nodulation gene NSP2 and a transcription factor, which we name ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 LIKE A (RHD6LA). We show that RHD6LA is required for facilitating infection thread formation in response to rhizobia and for preventing exaggerated root hair responses to commensal soil bacteria. The overlap between commensal and symbiotic signaling highlights the complexity of legume-microbe interactions at the root hair interface and suggests new mechanisms for microbial discrimination in rhizobium-responsive root hairs.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

The integrity of PRC2-mediated gene silencing depends critically on the ability of PRC2 to establish and propagate H3K27me3 beyond initial recruitment sites. The oncoproteins EZHIP and histone H3 K27M specifically inhibit this propagation by blocking the allosterically activated state of PRC2, leading to global disruption of H3K27me3 patterns and developmental abnormalities. To uncover chromatin-related pathways intersecting with PRC2 repression, we developed a Drosophila melanogaster model with tissue-specific expression of EZHIP and H3 K27M. A targeted RNAi screen of conserved chromatin regulators identified genetic modifiers that when knocked down either enhanced or suppressed developmental phenotypes driven by these PRC2 inhibitors. Strong suppressors, including the Trithorax-group proteins Ash1 and Trx, the PR-DUB complex member Asx, and the nucleoporin Nup153, restored normal development despite persistent depletion of global H3K27me3. Gene expression analyses revealed that suppression reflected reduced expression of genes aberrantly activated following PRC2 inhibition.

Local adaptation may be hindered or facilitated by pleiotropy, which is the control of multiple traits by a single genetic locus. In this study, we explored the connections between pleiotropy and local adaptation in the Texas endemic silverleaf sunflower, Helianthus argophyllus. Populations of H. argopyllus exhibit a bimodal life history strategy, consisting of tall, late-flowering forms and short, early-flowering forms that occur in close geographic proximity. The expression of life history traits within H. argophyllus populations is linked to local adaptation and controlled by a highly pleiotropic locus. Still, we do not know how local adaptation and pleiotropy interact at the transcriptomic level. We identified putatively locally adapted genes using whole RNA sequencing data and two selection outlier approaches. We assessed transcriptomic pleiotropy by evaluating whether allelic variants within genes control the expression of other genes (an eQTL approach) and gene co-expression network connectivity. Our results show that candidate locally adaptive genes identified by both methods are enriched for eQTL loci. Candidate genes identified through associations with environmental variables exhibit modular expression and have significantly lower network connectivity than non-adapted genes. In contrast, candidate genes identified only by controlling for population structure have significantly higher network connectivity. Our results suggest that the role of pleiotropy in local adaptation, at least at the transcriptomic level, depends on the function of the specific loci under selection.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Meiotic drive elements are regions of the genome that are transmitted to progeny at frequencies that exceed Mendelian expectations, often to the detriment of the organism. In maize there are three prevalent chromosomal drive elements known as Abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab10), K10L2, and the B chromosome. There has been much speculation about how these drivers might interact with each other and the environment in traditional maize landraces and their teosinte ancestors. Here we used genotype-by-sequencing data to score more than 10,000 maize and teosinte lines for the presence or absence of each driver. Less than ~0.5% of modern inbred lines carry chromosomal drivers. Among individuals from 5331 open-pollinated landraces, 6.32% carried Ab10, 5.16% carried K10L2, and 12.28% carried at least one B chromosome. Using a GWAS approach we identified unlinked loci that associate with the presence or absence of the selfish genetic elements. Many genetic modifiers are positively associated with the drivers, suggesting that there may have been selection for alleles that ameliorate their negative fitness consequences. We then assessed the contributions of population structure, associated loci, and the environment on the distribution of each chromosomal driver. There was no significant relationship between any chromosomal driver and altitude, contrary to conclusions based on smaller studies. Our data suggest that the distribution of the major chromosomal drivers is primarily influenced by neutral processes and the deleterious fitness consequences of the drivers themselves. While each driver has a unique relationship to genetic background and the environment, they are largely unconstrained by either.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Induction of viral mimicry by activation of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors has potential therapeutic applications for TNBC and other cancers. Suppressors of dsRNA sensing prevent sensing of endogenous dsRNAs and resulting autoimmunity. Depletion of the suppressor of dsRNA sensing ADAR1 causes activation of dsRNA sensors and cell death in many cancer cell lines. These ADAR1-dependent cells are generally also dependent on the dsRNA-binding protein PACT, which is highly expressed and essential in many TNBC cell lines. While PACT is known as an activator of the dsRNA sensor PKR, overexpression of PACT had no effect on activation of PKR in multiple TNBC cell lines. Conversely, depletion of PACT in PACT-dependent cell lines caused robust activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR and cell death, in addition to induction of integrated stress response genes and NF-{kappa}B targets. These phenotypes were entirely dependent on PKR. Rescue experiments revealed that PACT dimerization and dsRNA binding is required to suppress PKR activation. While depletion of PACT alone in ADAR1/ PACT-independent cell lines had no effect on PKR activation, combined depletion of both PACT and ADAR1 in those cell lines caused robust PKR activation and cell death, supporting a partially redundant role for ADAR1 and PACT in suppression of dsRNA sensing. Taken together, these findings support a vital role for PACT in suppressing PKR activation and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting PACT to treat TNBC.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

In samples from mice and humans, we show that upper large-intestinal content behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid that changes its viscoelastic properties under the force of gut contractions. This phenomenon is sufficient to explain micro-scale bacterial clustering in the murine cecum, resulting from growth within the gel-like structure of cecum content, and periodic disruption due to peristalsis-driven shear-thinning and clearance. Shear-thinning can also explain the surprising observation that fed beads enter the tip of the mouse cecum by flow along the epithelial cell layer before being mixed into the cecum content.

We derived acoustic onsets from a naturalistic soundscape and applied temporal response function (TRF) analysis to EEG data recorded from normal hearing listeners. Our results showed that shorter IOIs are associated with attenuated N1 and P2 amplitudes, replicating classical adaptation effects in a naturalistic soundscape. These effects remained stable when controlling for other acoustic features such as intensity and envelope sharpness and across different TRF model specifications.

A seizure forecasting system would greatly improve their quality of life. Successful seizure forecasting necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing seizure timing at multiple temporal scales. In this study, we investigated multiscale properties of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and seizure parameters in a highly realistic mouse model of focal cortical dysplasia-related epilepsy. We analyzed the properties' evolution at four timescales, ranging from epilepsy progression and seizure clusters to circadian and peri-ictal changes. We discovered that the FCD-related epilepsy syndrome was progressive in terms of interictal activity rate and seizure characteristics. Sixty percent of seizures occurred in clusters. During the clusters, the seizure duration, seizure power, and IED rate were increasing. Circadian rhythm influenced seizure occurrence with the peak seizure probability at 4 p.m. under a standard 12/12 light dark cycle with lights-on at 6 a.m. Peri-ictal analysis revealed no significant change in IED rate preceding individual seizures; however, a consistent two-peak pattern of IED elevation was observed following seizures. Specifically, an initial peak in IED rate emerged 5-10 minutes post-seizure, returning to baseline within two hours, followed by a secondary peak 6-12 hours later, which again subsided to baseline levels in 24-48 hours. This pattern could be fitted with a sum of three exponentials. Using the three-exponential pattern, we simulated IED rate fluctuations in each animal. The smoothed simulated IED rates showed good agreement with the smoothed real recorded IED rates, suggesting that the cumulative effect of post-ictal IED patterns can account for long-term fluctuations in IED rate. Our results indicate that, in our model of FCD-related epilepsy, consistent IED rate fluctuations follow rather than precede individual seizures. Therefore, fluctuations in IED rate can be viewed as a reflection of cyclic seizure occurrence. This implies that either IED rate fluctuations or accurate seizure records may be equally valuable for seizure risk forecasting.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

FC was derived from fMRI data filtered into two frequency bands and summarized as region-wise strength to capture nodal characteristics. Our findings revealed that glucose delivery is linked with FC strength, particularly when fMRI signal frequencies include greater hemodynamic contributions.

In our study, we employ persistent homology (PH), a prominent tool in topological data analysis (TDA), to investigate changes in resting-state functional connectivity in healthy aging and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We analyze functional connectivity changes across three distinct scales: (a) global scale (brain-wide changes), (b) mesoscopic scale (resting-state network-level changes), and (c) local scale (region-level changes). At the local scale, we introduce node persistence, a novel and scalable PH-based measure that detects brain regions with significant differences in healthy aging or ASD. Notably, these regions overlap with regions whose non-invasive stimulation improves motor function in the elderly or alleviates ASD symptoms, suggesting the utility of node persistence in identifying clinically relevant brain regions affected by aging and ASD.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

In models of connectivity, it has so far remained difficult to match all of them at once, in particular the higher-order structure appears to be elusive. Here we introduce a new type of graph model that matches non-random structure characterized and described as relevant in biological neuronal networks. The structure emerges because the algorithm considers the need for axons to physically bridge the gap from soma to dendrites. If it targets one neuron, probabilities that it also targets other nearby neurons increase. We demonstrate that the algorithm can be successfully fit to complex, biologically relevant reference connectomes. Furthermore, we outline an intuitive expansion of the model from merely local to a combination of local and long-range connectivity. We provide a performant implementation that can be used to instantiate point neuron or morphologically-detailed network models at whole-cortex scale.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

In chronic infections or cancers, lasting antigen exposure leads to permanent PDCD1 expression that can limit immune-mediated clearance of pathogens or degenerated cells. Consequently, blocking PDCD1 can enhance T cell function, which is the basis of cancer immune checkpoint therapy. We found that PDCD1 expression (mRNA and protein) can increase within hours of temperature elevation in human leukemic and lymphoblastoid cell lines (such as Jurkat, THP1, HL-60, GM07062, and NK-92) and mouse lymphoid organs (e.g., thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes). Transcriptional upregulation of the PDCD1 gene was associated with the binding of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to the promoter, and HSF1 knockout in HL-60 cells resulted in reduced PDCD1 activation. Furthermore, heat shock-dependent increase in glycosylated (and therefore active) PDCD1 protein levels was associated with PDCD1 exposure on the cell membrane and a reduction in the cytotoxic properties of NK-92 cells. Our observations suggest that the immune response could be attenuated in various physiological conditions accompanied by increased temperatures (infection, heat stroke, etc.). This observation may have clinical implications, and therefore, further research is warranted to understand the importance of fever and PDCD1 in various disease states, as well as their interaction with treatment.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

It thus includes: taxa that are, have been, or were proposed to be regulated; alien taxa that are or have been present in South Africa (including those only ever recorded in quarantine facilities); taxa that are native to a part of South Africa that have formed native-alien populations in another part of the country; and taxa which have been recorded at some point as alien or for which the risk of invasion has been evaluated. Names used previously are included so it is clear why taxa listed in historical sources are no longer considered alien or present, and how such names have been interpreted in terms of the latest authoritative taxonomic sources. The list also includes information on the invasion status of the taxa, their pathways, distributions, impacts, and management, with metadata provided for all 38 variables, including confidence and data sources for 23 of them. The development of documented and repeatable workflows ensures it is clear why taxa (and associated information) are included on the list and facilitates reviews and updates. Based on information up to the end of December 2022, the checklist includes over 6000 taxa, of which over 3500 are alien taxa confirmed as present outside of captivity or cultivation. However, several key data sources still need to be verified and integrated into the list (particularly taxa in captivity or cultivation). Thus, this list should not yet be regarded as a complete baseline of the knowledge of alien taxa present in South Africa. The checklist is presented in a manner that is tidy and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and will be maintained, expanded, and updated, with the aim for the list to become comprehensive and dynamic. By so doing, the checklist will allow the number and status of alien taxa to be tracked over time, informing management planning and regulatory decisions.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

The present study evaluated whether the lack of certain nutrients during pregnancy influences cognition while pregnant and in old age in mouse model. Non-targeted NMR analysis revealed significantly lower levels of numerous plasma nutrients and metabolites including choline and its derivatives on gestation day 7 compared to day 1. Novel object recognition and Morris Water Maze tests revealed impaired cognition in pregnant mice compared to nonpregnant controls. Choline deprivation worsened the cognitive impairment during pregnancy and choline supplementation alleviated it. Furthermore, choline availability during pregnancy affected cognition and general health in old age, with mice given a choline-deficient diet during pregnancy performed more poorly. RNA-Seq analysis indicates lasting effect of choline intake during pregnancy on hippocampal gene signatures in old age. Choline deprivation was associated with more upregulation of proinflammatory genes, whereas choline supplementation showed upregulation of neuroprotective genes such as Prl, Gh, and hemoglobin (Hba and Hbb subunits).

However, most methods are labor-intensive, often invasive, and impede large-scale studies. Here, we introduce two novel, non-invasive, deep learning-based methods to automatically measure key insect traits from images. First, we introduce a general approach using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) designed for broad applicability across diverse insect taxa. By adjusting for specimen orientation, this method measures length accurately with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.211 mm compared to conventional photomicroscope measurements and provides initial biomass estimates using established length-weight relationships. Second, we tested whether a specialized segmentation model requiring taxon-specific training improves biomass predictions. We show that a model for Tachinidae (Diptera, Calyptratae) can effectively delineate key body parts (head, thorax, abdomen) and provide accurate curvilinear body length, volume, and biomass estimates, correlating strongly with both wet (R {approx} 0.937) and dry (R {approx} 0.907) weight. Validation experiments demonstrate that our methods are accurate and offer advantages over traditional techniques by reducing handling and improving scalability. This is important because developing similar segmentation models for just the 20 most dominant flying insect families collected in bulk samples like Malaise traps could cover around 50% of specimens, and the modular design of our segmentation pipeline allows for seamless updates to include additional families. Together, these two new approaches for morphometric analysis provide an efficient, scalable framework for automated insect data acquisition, with broad implications for diverse ecological and evolutionary studies, ranging from functional trait ecology and population-level assessments to large-scale biodiversity monitoring and conservation initiatives.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

The models are based on volumetric representations derived from computed tomography (CT) scans of a live bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). We iteratively modify the anatomical structures included in the model and use the predicted head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) as a proxy for comparison. Our results show that the mandibular fat bodies, which support a lower sound speed than the surrounding tissues, significantly enhance the forward receiving directionality at echolocation frequencies through refraction, in a manner similar to the melon in shaping the dolphins' highly directional transmission beams. Additionally, we show that, in the frequencies encompassing dolphin communication signals, the air volumes help block the otherwise complex sound transmission through the bones. These findings highlight convergent evolutionary solutions in toothed whale anatomy to create strong directionality in both sound emission and reception governed by the same physical principles.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

MCP-ANM and MCP-mANM (multiscale ANM) outperform traditional ANM models that do not explicitly consider membranes when predicting the flexibility of various types of membrane proteins. Furthermore, by integrating MCP-mANM with Perturbation Response Scanning (PRS), we are able to efficiently simulate the conformational changes of MS proteins subjected to different mechanical forces. This methodology allows for the examination of various gating mechanisms, including force-from-lipids and force-from-tether, across multiple MS ion channels such as NOMPC, MscS, and PIEZO. The calculated mechanosensitivity of the MS channels aligns well with the experimental findings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of MCP-incorporated ANM in linking mechanical stimuli to protein dynamics, providing a reliable and efficient framework for understanding the mechanotransduction and gating mechanisms of MS ion channels.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

However, the direct effects of compression on neurons and the underlying biophysical mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using multi-scale compression systems and physiologically relevant in vitro and in vivo models, we find that mechanical compression induces neuronal apoptosis and synapse loss, leading to disrupted neural network activity. This is accompanied by increased HIF-1 signaling and upregulation of downstream stress-adaptive genes in neurons. We further show that compression triggers AP-1 - driven gene expression in glial cells, promoting a neuroinflammatory response.

These neurons abundantly express three types of dopamine receptors, with some having direct synaptic connections with dopaminergic neurons. Of these receptors, suppressing the expression of Dop1R2 reduces sound responses of auditory sensory neurons in unmated but not mated females. Moreover, expression of Dop1R2 in auditory sensory neurons enhances the song response behavior of unmated females, manifested by copulation receptivity when exposed to songs.

This study investigated the interaction effects of bilateral and unilateral mental practice on event-related desynchronization (ERD) amplitude and unilateral motor performance, to explore better clinical rehabilitation for stroke patients with hemiparesis. The task was a ball rotation, where participants circulated two balls on their palm by using their fingers. Seventy-six healthy young adults were randomly assigned to one of three mental practice groups or a control group without mental practice. In the mental practice groups, three subgroups of participants engaged in ball-rotation motor imagery for two blocks in different orders: bilateral hand imagery followed by left hand imagery (BL group), left hand imagery followed by bilateral hand imagery (LB group), and consecutive left hand imagery (LL group).  The results showed greater improvement in actual motor performance in the BL group than in the control group, while the performance of the LB and LL groups did not significantly differ from that of the control group. Greater ERD was observed in the BL group than in the LL group in the early sets of the first block. However, ERD amplitude decreased with continued mental practice, and significant correlations between ERD and motor performance were limited. These results suggest that engaging in bilateral mental practice before unilateral mental practice is beneficial in improving unilateral motor performance. Bilateral mental practice following unilateral mental practice may provide neither notable improvements nor detrimental effects on unilateral motor action.

While immune alterations during pregnancy are well characterized, postpartum cytokine dynamics and their impact on malaria susceptibility remain poorly defined. This study uniquely investigates how cytokine balance shifts, contribute to malaria susceptibility in primigravid women during the postpartum period. Methods: A total of 33 Burkinabe women were enrolled at delivery and followed up at 1 and 3 months postpartum. Serum cytokine concentrations (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-{gamma}) were quantified by ELISA. Malaria infection was detected by PCR and microscopy. Statistical analyses included effect size calculations and cluster analyses to assess immune profiles. Results: At delivery, 48.5% of women tested positive for malaria by PCR. Malaria-infected women had significantly elevated IL-10 levels and a decreased IL-6:IL-10 ratio compared with non-infected women (p = 0.005). This anti-inflammatory shift persisted into the during early postpartum period. Strong correlations were observed between IL-10 levels and malaria infection ({delta} = 0.9, p < 0.001). Of note, IL-4 also showed a significant effect, highlighting a complex immunoregulatory environment. Conclusion: Our findings reveal, for the first time in a Sub-Saharan primigravid cohort, that an IL-10-dominant cytokine profile at delivery is strongly associated with postpartum malaria susceptibility.

This results in the activation of Syk by auto- phosphorylation, triggering phosphorylation of several downstream targets in a process that will culminate in F-actin polymerization and phagocytosis of the IgG-opsonized target.\n\nWe found that Syk is S-acylated upon phagocytosis by macrophages. Palmitoylation is performed on a single Syk-Cys by the protein S-acyl transferase DHHC5 that specifically associates with Syk upon phagocytosis. Syk palmitoylation is required for Syk localization to the phagocytic cup, Syk phosphorylation/activation, Cdc42 recruitment to the cup, F-actin polymerization and phagocytosis.\n\nWe also observed that another Syk-Cys residue is modified by sulfenylation. Mutation of the sulfenylated Cys that belongs to a redox-motif inactivated the Syk catalytic activity and phagocytosis. We found that Syk desulfenylation occurs during phagocytosis. Molecular dynamics studies indicated that desulfenylation increased the mobility and exposure of a loop within the Syk interdomain B, likely facilitating phosphorylation of key Syk-Tyr residues by upstream effectors such as Src kinases.\n\nWe thus propose an original updated model for Syk activation during Fc{gamma}R-mediated phagocytosis that involves both Syk palmitoylation and desulfenylation.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

These haploinsufficient mice exhibit variably penetrant craniofacial and cardiac defects mimicking the phenotypes of DBAS patients bearing RPL5 mutations. We additionally discovered that this specific heterozygous splicing mutation is pathogenic and leads to intron retention. By examining the transcriptome of fetal liver erythroid progenitors at E12.5, we demonstrate that the downregulation of erythroid differentiation pathways is consistent with the DBAS phenotype. We also identified dysregulation of lipid metabolism genes with significant reduction in the abundance of Scd1 in a subset of E12.5 mutant embryos at risk for erythroid failure. SCD1, a key enzyme that converts saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids, has not been previously linked to erythropoiesis or DBAS.

Methods: A serum-free, fully humanized co-culture system utilizing human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) was developed to differentiate CB-CD34+ cells towards B and NK cell lineages. Differentiation dynamics were monitored via flow cytometry, with immunophenotypic analysis tracking progression from progenitors to mature cells.

Serum-free media conditions ensured reproducibility and high overall yield of B and NK cell progenitors. Flow cytometry identified distinct population peaks, confirming temporal control over differentiation.

Here, we designed, tested, and present a guide to recycling surplus gas chromatographs for use as a thermal chamber that allows accurate and high throughput assessment of CTmax at relatively low cost. 3. We found the GC to be an adequate heating chamber for thermal experiments. Installation of a rotating rack that can hold glass observation vials allows for rapid identification of loss of equilibrium in subjects. We evaluated the CTmax of a common generalist predator in the Arizona cotton agroecosystem, Collops vittatus. Additional tests of static heat exposure also revealed that this chamber can be used for assessing the impacts of heat stress on predatory behavior. 4. We hope to encourage other ecologists to use this guide to recycle surplus laboratory equipment for use in thermal ecology studies. We believe that our thermal insect carousel can be used for CTmax, lethal temperature, and behavioral bioassays.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Twelve cases of inter-continental spread of wheat yellow rust, including seven cases with major impact on disease epidemics in recipient areas, were detected from genotypic analyses of 3240 pathogen samples from 41 countries at six continents. In three cases, the most plausible mechanism for novel pathogen diversity was somatic hybridization via nuclear reassortment between co-existing lineages on shared host cultivars, spreading by LDD from Europe to South America and Australia, respectively, a few years after first detection. Several high-impact incursions from South Asia into East Africa were also observed, including PstS16 with a dramatic impact on wheat breeding programs of global relevance.

During artisanal processing for flour production, liquid waste containing cyanide may be disposed of inappropriately, contaminating soils, rivers and streams. Various microorganisms must proliferate and carry out fermentation from this waste. The study was carried out on a family farm in the municipality of Braganca, in the state of Para, Brazil. Samples were selected from the effluents generated in four stages (fermentation tank, post-fermentation washing water tank, washing/pressing water tank (manipueira) and effluent lagoon). The aim of this study is therefore to track down microorganisms and their enzymes, through metaproteomics, at all stages of cassava processing up to the elimination of wastewater discharges, using the metaproteomics technique in order to track down potential cyanide bioremediators adapted to local environmental conditions. The samples were extracted using the Phenol-SDS protocol, washed, digested and submitted to a high-resolution mass spectrometer coupled to liquid chromatography and subsequently analyzed using sensitive software. Microorganisms with potential cyanide bioremediation potential were identified (Bacillus subitilis, Pseudomonas putida and Levilactobacillus brevis), as well as nitrogen fixers involved in bioremediation. The identified peptides analyzed showed proteins involved in: DNA repair; glycosylation; phosphorylation; CAZY proteins, among others.

M.; Matsuzaki, S.; Pranay, A.; Zhu, J.; Faakye, A.; Humphries, K. M.", "abstract": "BackgroundThe hearts constant energy demands make metabolic flexibility critical to its function as nutrient availability varies. The enzyme phosphofructokinase-2/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB2) contributes to this flexibility by acting as a positive or negative regulator of cardiac glycolysis. We have previously shown that PFKFB2 is degraded in the diabetic heart and that a cardiac-specific PFKFB2 knockout (cKO) impacts ancillary glucose pathways and mitochondrial substrate preference. Therefore, defining PFKFB2s role in mitochondrial metabolic flexibility is paramount to understanding both metabolic homeostasis and metabolic syndromes. Further, it is unknown how PFKFB2 loss impacts the hearts response to acute stress. Here we examined how cardiac mitochondrial flexibility and the post-translational modification O-GlcNAcylation are affected in cKO mice in response to fasting or pharmacologic stimulation.\n\nMethodscKO and litter-matched controls (CON) were sacrificed in the fed or fasted (12 hours) states, with or without a 20 minute stimulant stress of caffeine and epinephrine.\n\nMitochondrial respiration, metabolomics, and changes to systemic glucose homeostasis were evaluated.\n\nResultscKO mice had moderate impairment in mitochondrial metabolic flexibility, affecting downstream glucose oxidation, respiration, and CPT1 activity. O-GlcNAcylation, a product of ancillary glucose metabolism, was upregulated in cKO hearts in the fed state, but this was ameliorated in the fasted state. Furthermore, metabolic remodeling in response to PFKFB2 loss was sufficient to impact circulating glucose in fasted and stressed states.\n\nConclusionsPFKFB2 is essential for fed-to-fasted changes in cardiac metabolism and plays an important regulatory role in protein O-GlcNAcylation.

Injury can present in two different locations, modeled in rats as postganglionic and preganglionic neurectomies. Osseous deformities are present following both injury types. However, the underlying factors behind these deformities are not fully understood. While past studies have explored muscle structure and altered mechanical joint loading as factors, bone metabolism, muscle composition, and muscle-bone crosstalk have not been fully explored. Using postganglionic and preganglionic BPBI rat models and a disuse model, bone metabolism, muscle composition, and muscle-bone crosstalk were explored. Dynamic histomorphometry and similar methods were used to characterize humeral growth and humeral growth plate activity to understand bone metabolism, muscle fibrosis was analyzed to assess muscle composition, and FGF-2 quantification was performed to assess muscle-bone crosstalk. Postganglionic injury portrayed more changes in the humeral diaphyseal region than preganglionic and displayed reduced bone metabolism on the endosteal surface while preganglionic displayed reduced bone metabolism on the periosteal surface. However, only preganglionic showed significantly lower growth plate activity. In regards to fibrosis, both injury types showed fibrosis in the biceps but only preganglionic showed fibrosis in the subscapularis. The limb disuse model did not show fibrosis. Additionally, preganglionic had an increased production of FGF-2 signaling more so in the subscapularis. Overall, deformities from postganglionic injury may be from bone formation and bone resorption while deformities from preganglionic injury are likely from an overall reduction in bone growth that is not solely from limb disuse. The fibrosis and FGF-2 signaling alterations seen are not likely to be the direct cause of osseous deformity and the drivers behind the alterations are likely different between postganglionic and preganglionic injuries.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

This is particularly true for cardiac fibrosis, a form of CVD wherein the wound healing process has gone awry. In cardiac fibrosis, excessive scar tissue formation due to dysregulated remodeling of the heart's extracellular matrix (ECM) results in increased stiffness that reduces cardiac output and can lead to heart failure. This dysregulated ECM deposition is driven by activated cardiac fibroblasts, where cell substrate stiffness is known to play a role in cardiac fibroblast activation. New preclinical models that accurately recapitulate the behavior of activated cardiac fibroblasts are needed to better understand and treat cardiac fibrosis. To this end, we describe a model wherein human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) are cultured on 3D printed hydrogels of tunable stiffness, fabricated using dosage controlled digital light processing (DLP). We demonstrate that our model can induce HCF activation in the absence of TGF{beta}, a key mediator of fibroblast activation, surpassing the activation levels seen with HCFs activated with TGF{beta} on protein-coated tissue culture plates. Furthermore, combining stiffer hydrogels with TGF{beta} recapitulates fibroblast activation similar to what is observed in native cardiac tissue. Lastly, by indirectly coculturing HCFs seeded and activated on these stiff hydrogels with hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, we demonstrate that the activated HCFs in our cardiac fibrosis model can impair cardiomyocyte function, mimicking the deleterious effects of cardiac fibrosis.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Droplet-based targeted single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) has been used to genotype targeted loci across thousands of cells enabling high-throughput assessment of gene editing efficiency. Here, we constructed a ground truth gene editing single-cell DNAseq atlas, along with an artifact-aware computational workflow called GUMM (Genotyping Using Mixture Models) to systematically infer single-cell allelism from these data. This resource was created by expanding CRISPR-Cas9-edited HL-60 clones that harbored distinct insertion-deletion (indel) profiles in CLEC12A and mixing them at pre-defined ratios to create artificial cocktails that mimic the potential editing diversity of a CRISPR-Cas9 experiment. This enabled assessment of technical artifacts that confound interpretation of allelism in the readouts of gene edited cells.

While these collections can improve the sensitivity and specificity of classification methods, this requires highly efficient compressed indexes. K-mer-based approaches like Kraken 2 are efficient but limit the analysis to a fixed k-mer length. This is hard for the user to set ahead of time, and suboptimal settings can harm sensitivity and specificity. Methods that use compressed full-text indexes like SPUMONI2 and Cliffy lift this constraint, but are less efficient than k-mer-based tools. Further, these methods either cannot report a full listing of genomes where a match occurs, or cannot scale to large reference databases. We propose new methods and algorithms that use compressed full-text indexes to enable multi class and taxonomic classification. Unlike past compressed-indexing methods for classification, ours uses the move structure, which is extremely fast thanks to its locality of reference. Our method, called Movi Color, augments the main table of the Movi index. Specifically, Movi Color assigns a \"color\" to each run of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform according to the subset of genomes from which the run suffixes originated. When the reference is highly repetitive, as is typical when indexing pangenomes or reference databases, only certain colors occur, creating opportunities to compress the index. For species-level classification, Movi Color achieves over 1.6x higher precision and 2x higher recall than Kraken 2 and Metabuli. At the genus level, it achieves 70% higher precision and 80% higher recall. Movi Color's read processing time is 7-20x faster than Metabuli and is comparable to Kraken 2. Although Movi Color uses more memory than both Kraken 2 and Metabuli,its speed-accuracy trade-off makes it well-suited for real-time or high-throughput scenarios.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Numerous antibody-drug conjugates have received FDA approval; however, clinical resistance arises commonly in tumors. Resistance mechanisms include decreased expression or mutation of the antibody target, failure to release the payload from the ADC, or increased expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters associated with multidrug resistance. We therefore sought to characterize the interactions of ABC multidrug transporters with ADC payloads. Methods: We performed a high-throughput screen with 27 common ADC payloads using cells lines expressing ABC transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by ABCB1) or ABCG2 (encoded by ABCG2). Confirmatory assays were also performed using cells transfected to express P-gp, ABCG2, or MRP1 (encoded by ABCC1). Results: Several commonly used ADC payloads were found to be avid substrates of P-gp, including calicheamicin gamma1, monomethyl auristatin E, DM1, and DM4. All the pyrrolobenzodiazepines tested - SJG136, SGD-1882, SG2057, and SG3199 - were substrates of P-gp, ABCG2, and MRP1. The modified anthracyclines nemorubicin and its metabolite PNU-159682 were poorly transported by both ABCB1 and ABCG2 and displayed nanomolar to picomolar toxicity. Further, we found that the efficacy of the recently FDA-approved ADC mirvetuximab soravtansine, which has DM4 as the toxic payload, was decreased in cell lines with overexpression of P-gp. Conclusion: Several commonly used ADC payloads can be effluxed from cells by ABC transporters which may lead to transporter-mediated drug resistance in patients. Future ADCs should be developed using payloads that are not substrates of ABC transporters.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Using a novel Cdh5cre-ERT2;cIAP1-/-;cIAP2fl/fl animal model, this study investigated the contribution of endothelial c-IAP2 in this process, revealing P2X7R overexpression as a putative target in the onset of Sch-PH. Pharmacologically, inhibition of P2X7R function confirmed its role in promoting lung endothelial death and disease progression. Moreover, data suggest that microbiome-associated metabolic alterations in Sch-PH seem linked to microvascular endothelial apoptosis driven by ATP/P2X7R overactivation and suppressed c-IAP2 expression. Indeed, genetic ablation of endothelial c-IAP2 expression was sufficient to induce PH-like features in mice, with echocardiography indicating a higher pulmonary acceleration time (PAT), PAT/pulmonary ejection time (PET), and right ventricular free wall thickness after IP/IV-Egg challenge compared to controls. These findings suggest a significant contribution of lung endothelial P2X7R activation and c-IAP2 suppression to Sch-PH pathology, highlighting them as promising novel therapeutic targets for this life-threatening illness.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Glycol ethers consist in a widely used class of organic solvents leading to workers and consumers exposure via many different applications. Ethylene glycol ethers are gradually being replaced by propylene glycol ethers thought to be less toxic. However, their neurotoxicity is not systematically assessed prior to placing them on the market. Therefore, this study investigated the potential neurotoxicity of propylene glycol butyl ether (PGBE) for which no official occupational limit has been established. To this aim, new approach methodologies have been used. Human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived BrainSpheres model was exposed to PGBE and to its main metabolite, 2-butoxypropanoic acid (2BPA). An integrative multiomic approach (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics) was adopted to assess molecular alterations, derive benchmark concentrations and define potential mechanisms of action. PGBE was neurotoxic at occupationally relevant exposure concentrations. This was shown for the first time in human cells. And, although PGBE was more cytotoxic than 2BPA, both compounds showed very similar neurotoxicity. PGBE and 2BPA strongly affected the cell cycle, induced oxidative stress and perturbed energy and lipid metabolism. They also targeted specific nervous system processes, such as axon guidance and synapse organization. Finally, 2BPA may trigger ferroptosis by increased iron uptake.

Mature (3 months), adult (6 months), middle-aged (12 months), and old-age (24 months) mice were exposed to mercury (HgCl2) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 4-5 weeks. While spontaneous anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) increased with age in PBS-treated mice (34% in middle-aged, 57% in old-age mice), HgIA incidence declined in old age mice, with only 59% (26/44) developing significant ANoA titers compared to 91-100% in younger cohorts. Notably, 56% (10/18) of initially ANoA-negative old mice had detectable ANoA at a lower dilution, indicating a reduced but not absent response. ANoA negativity in old age mice was associated with lower immunoglobulin levels, reduced anti-chromatin antibodies, and diminished germinal center formation, suggestive of immunosenescence. Flow cytometry revealed age-related declines in CD4+ T cells, with mercury exposure augmenting T-cell differentiation in younger but not old mice.

Natal and breeding dispersal are key parameters of such models but can be challenging to estimate and may vary by sex. Along the Northumberland coast, Arctic Terns Sterna paradisaea nest across sites separated by distances up to 32 km. From ringing and recapture of nestling and nesting adult Arctic Terns over two decades, natal philopatry in component sites of this metapopulation was high and recruitment to a colony with managed public access was similar to nearby colonies with no public access. Mean head length of nesting birds recruited from non-natal sites was significantly smaller than those nesting on their natal site. Sexual-size dimorphism was used to estimate the proportions of each sex in capture samples and indicated that males were generally faithful to their natal site but up to nearly a third of females may have dispersed to non-natal sites. Arctic Terns breed from two years of age; head length data indicated that breeding birds of two to four years old were mainly female, and suggested that the first-breeding age of males was up to three years older.

C.; Reichert, M.", "abstract": "Mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining generates large volumes of waste rock. Weathering of this waste rock releases selenium, which can bioaccumulate to levels that can harm, and even extirpate, downstream fish communities. This is well demonstrated in ecosystems impacted by active MTR operations; however, less is known about the long-term impacts after coal mines close. Here we show that MTR coal mines still present an acute threat to downstream fish populations, decades after mining ends. Crowsnest Lake (Alberta, Canada) receives runoff from the Tent Mountain Coal Mine, which closed in the 1980s and part of which was certified reclaimed. Fish in Crowsnest Lake contain tissue selenium concentrations (5-26 g/g dry weight) that exceed guidelines and rival fish selenium levels downstream of active MTR operations. This is despite lake water selenium concentrations ([&le;]2 g/L) that are below water quality guidelines intended to protect fish. The clinical signs of selenium poisoning in fish are similar to the symptoms of Whirling Disease, which was first detected in the Crowsnest basin in 2016 making this the first aquatic system to be impacted by both stressors. This finding demonstrates that the biological impacts of MTR coal mining can persist long after mining operations end, and it suggests that any further coal mine development may well push the Crowsnest fishery beyond sustainability.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

The present study was carried out to assess the extent of genetic variability among groundnut genotypes for agro-morphological and quality traits. Thirty-six groundnut genotypes were evaluated in a 6 x 6 simple lattice design during 2021 post-rainy season under irrigation at Dire Dawa, the research station of Haramaya university, Ethiopia. Data were collected on kernel yield and other morphological traits, oil content and oil yield. The data on traits were subjected for principal component (PC) values, clustering and Euclidean distance. In this study, the first six Principal Components Analysis (PCA) found to be significant and accounted for 74.51% of the total variation in which the first principal component (PC1) and the second principal component (PC2) contributed more to the variation. Those 36 genotypes were grouped into six major clusters and the dendrogram showed that cluster I, II, III, IV, V and VI included 6, 9, 8, 5, 7 and 1 numbers of genotypes in that order. Euclidean distance ranged from 2.45 to 8.54 with the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of 5.44, 1.17 and 21.56%, respectively. Based on the result of the current study, there were variations of genetic distances among genotypes, Gv17 and Gv28, Gv3 and Gv23, Gv3 and Gv30, Gv15 and Gv17, Gv22 and Gv28, and Gv3 and Gv34 which could be exploited through hybridization for cultivar development in groundnut breeding programs in Ethiopia.

V.", "abstract": "The three-dimensional (3D) organization of interphase chromatin in eukaryotes is complex; details of the corresponding genome structures vary stochastically from cell to cell. Here, we propose a metric to quantify the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of the 3D chromatin conformations in ensembles of single cells: Conformational Heterogeneity (C.H.) is defined as the standard deviation of the ensemble distribution of the per cell average Euclidean inter-loci distances [&lt;]Rs[&gt;], for a given genomic separation s between the loci. We have used the metric to examine and quantify in detail the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of conformations of the interphase X chromosome in fruit fly generated via three distinctly different modeling approaches, which take experimental Hi-C data as input. Two of the approaches use bulk Hi-C and lamina-DamID data, while the third relies on single-cell Hi-C maps. An algorithm is proposed to facilitate comparison of C.H. of models constructed at different resolutions, and to examine the behavior of conformational heterogeneity with increasing model resolution. Higher resolution models show a greater C.H., in general. The impact of the model resolution is strongest near the genomic distance s corresponding to the resolution limit of the model, and diminishes for larger genomic distances: extrapolating the resolution from approximately 14 kb to 2 kb has little effect on the C.H. beyond [~]100 kb. All chromatin models examined in this work show a very similar trend of monotonically increasing structural heterogeneity with s, up to the genomic TAD size; beyond that, significant differences arise, with the model based on single-cell Hi-C showing nearly opposite trend compared to the two models that use bulk Hi-C data. We attribute these major differences to relatively subtle differences in the modeling approaches, which we discuss. Based on the analysis, we propose to explore the possibility of inclusion of bulk Hi-C data into training of chromatin models that are based on necessarily limited single-cell Hi-C data. Within our computational approach, depletion of nuclear lamins leads to increased structural heterogeneity at nearly all genomic separations, with the potential implication that cell functions that depend on chromatin structure might be more variable within lamins depleted nuclei compared to the wild type.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

These oligosaccharides subsequently engage inhibitory Siglec receptors on immune cells, allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. The genetic mechanisms by which this glycome remodeling occurs remain poorly defined. Understanding the ways that cancer cells change their cell surface glycosylation is critical for identification of biomarkers and targets for glycan-directed immunotherapy. In this study, we performed multiple gain-of-function CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens to broadly define genetic pathways that regulate expression of Siglec-binding glycans. We show that Siglec ligand expression is largely controlled through genetic competition between genes that catalyze 2,3-sialylation and GlcNAcylation of galactose residues. Perturbation of enzyme expression at this key biosynthetic node provides multiple paths by which cancers can acquire elevated expression of Siglec ligands. We further show that cancer glycome remodeling is aided by overexpression of novel professional ligands that facilitate Siglec-glycan binding. Notably, we also find that expression of the CD24 gene is genetically dispensable for cell-surface binding of the inhibitory receptor Siglec-10. Finally, by integrating our functional genetic model with clinical tumor genomic data, we identify the sulfotransferase enzyme GAL3ST4 as a potential novel driver of immune evasion in glioma cells. Taken together, this study provides a first-in-class genomic atlas to aid understanding of cancer-associated glycosylation and identifies immediately actionable targets for cancer immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Bacteriophages (phages) interact dynamically with their prokaryotic hosts and play a crucial role in shaping the structure and function of microbial communities. Previous approaches for inferring phage-host interactions from metagenomic data (e.g., assembly-based methods) are constrained by high computational demands, limited sensitivity, and the inability to accurately capture ecological relationships. To address these issues, we developed phiNODE (phage-host interaction predictor using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations), a deep learning method for predicting phage-host interactions directly from metagenomic profiles. We first validated phiNODE using synthetic datasets generated by ecological models and found that it outperformed both alternative deep-learning and co-abundance-based methods in inferring phage-host interactions. We then applied phiNODE to a large-scale metagenomic dataset comprising 7,016 stool samples from healthy individuals and identified 90% more genus-level phage-host interactions than traditional assembly-based methods. Finally, we demonstrated that the latent representations learned by phiNODE served as more powerful features than taxonomic abundance-based features for disease classifications. In summary, phiNODE offers a novel framework for inferring phage-host interactions from shotgun metagenomic data, representing an innovative approach for advancing microbiome research and clinical applications.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

All ligands are prepared by considering unspecified isomeric elements and combining semi-empirical calculations with MD simulations to explore their conformational space. The so-collected molecules allowed extended analyses of both ligands and targets, and the study presents some preliminary results. The performed analyses revealed that on average active ligands are larger than inactive molecules, while possessing a similar polarity. The scaffold analysis emphasized the expected and crucial role of aromatic systems, even though with some relevant differences between active and inactive molecules. Moreover, similar targets often show conserved binding sites and there is a limited but not negligible relationship between the similarity of binding sites and ligands suggesting that similar pockets tend to bind rather similar ligands. Finally, the collected biological data also allowed the analysis of the polypharmacological profile of the ligands endowed with more than one biological value.

We show that IDRs facilitate initial non-specific association with DNA and promote one-dimensional diffusion toward target motifs, supported by charge-mediated interactions. Remarkably, the IDR-dependent search mechanism displays sequence sensitivity, with promoter-derived sequences enhancing both initial binding and sliding rates, demonstrating that Msn2-DNA interactions alone are sufficient to confer promoter selectivity in the absence of chromatin or cofactors.

L.; Kopec, W.", "abstract": "BK channels are a class of K+ channels that possess an unusually high conductance and are synergistically gated by intracellular Ca2+ and voltage. Despite the significant array of experimental and computational data, many aspects of their function and dynamics remain unclear - such as how ion permeation is halted in the closed state of the channel. Available CryoEM structures obtained in deactivating conditions capture the channel with a wide, unobstructed pore, in contrast to e.g. a helix bundle crossing observed in some K+ channels. Several hypotheses of BK closure were proposed, including selectivity filter and hydrophobic gating. In this work, we expand on the model of hydrophobic gating and focus on the role of lipids. Based on our atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we propose lipid entrance into the pore - either with lipid tails or entire lipid molecules - through the membrane-facing fenestrations to be a critical determinant of BK conductivity. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism of BK activation by negatively charged lipids, and suggest that they act by a multi-modal mechanism, which encompasses lipid entry reduction, increase of the K+ occupancy of the pore, and stabilization of the channel open-state structure - in broad agreement with experimental data. This presents an example of the crucial role of lipids in regulating BK channel activity, and paves the way to further understanding of BK function in such complex environments as cellular membranes.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Detailed analysis of the model's components reveals that, for LFY, the density and quality of binding sites constitute the most important features but were not sufficient on their own to predict regulatory activity. The presence of binding sites for other transcription factors and the overall richness in TFBS were also essential.

In this study, we used high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the cortico-peripheral dynamics of beta bursts in forearm extensor muscles during isometric contractions at the motor unit (MU) level. We show that MU activity in the upper limb exhibits discrete beta bursts that are temporally aligned with cortical beta activity. Notably, beta bursts in the periphery were time-locked to cortical bursts, suggesting strong coordination and synchronisation of bursting across the corticospinal tract. We also found stronger beta synchronisation in the extensor carpi ulnaris compared to the extensor carpi radialis, indicating muscle-specific differences in shared neural drive. These findings provide the first demonstration of beta burst propagation from cortex to upper-limb MUs and show that HDsEMG can reliability detect such events in the upper limb.

H.; Uttekar, B.; Wafer, R.; Cendanawati, S.", "abstract": "When enteropathogenic bacteria breach the intestinal epithelium, they are recognized by epithelial and immune cells that elicit an intestinal regenerative response. However, less is known about whether and how intestinal progenitors directly detect invading pathogenic bacteria and couple this to their proliferation. Here we show that adult Drosophila midgut progenitors recognise peptidoglycan from pathogenic bacteria through the peptidoglycan recognition proteins, PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, and translate this to ISC proliferation by stimulating MKK3-p38 signalling. Moreover, we find that PGRP-LC/LE-MKK3-p38 signalling in progenitors regulates p38 activation throughout the midgut epithelium after infection, indicating that progenitors can influence the regenerative niche in a non-cell autonomous manner. Whilst it was previously thought that ISC proliferation in both mammals and flies is driven solely by damage-induced signals after infection, our work reveals that progenitors can directly recognise pathogenic bacteria and mount a strong parallel regenerative response that spreads throughout the midgut epithelium. Increased ISC proliferation after bacterial recognition may also serve as a strategy to repopulate the epithelium with uninfected cells.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

R.; Chamorro-Garcia, R.", "abstract": "Over the past several decades, there has been a resurgence in the field of multigenerational research, which focuses on the transmission of environmental effects across generations and their correlation with the prevalence of chronic diseases. Traditionally, it has been hypothesized that the propagation of such effects is mediated by alterations in gene regulatory elements sensitive to environmental cues. These alterations can be perpetuated throughout development and across generations in the absence of any genetic changes, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications or non-coding RNAs. Evidence suggesting that the compartmentalization of eukaryotic genomes into heterochromatin and euchromatin plays a crucial role in mediating multigenerational metabolism-disrupting effects elicited by the exposure to different metabolism disruptors has been observed in mice and fruit flies. This suggests that eukaryotic nuclear genomes may generally possess the capacity to integrate the impact of environmental cues in a metastable manner that is phenotypically relevant. In this study, we present the initial results of a murine model to determine whether preconception exposure to metabolism disruptors leads to metabolic alterations in the offspring of exposed individuals. We specifically focused on investigating the effects of three metabolism disruptors of distinct nature, designed to model the complexity of human exposures. Our findings are not only consistent with our central hypothesis but also open an unexpected avenue to explore whether preconception exposure to metabolism disruptors can predispose the offspring of exposed individuals to not only typical metabolic diseases such as obesity, but also to complex metabolic-psychiatric conditions such as anorexia.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Here we used the qFit algorithm to model \"hidden\" alternate conformations from electron density maps for an entire protein family, the Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPs), spanning 26 enzymes and 221 structures. To interrogate these multiconformer models, we developed a new algorithm, Residue Interaction Networks From Alternate conformations In RElated structures (RINFAIRE), that calculates networks of interactions between flexible residues and quantitatively compares them. We show that PTPs share a common allosteric network which rewires dynamically in response to catalytic loop motions or active-site vs. allosteric ligand binding, but also that individual PTPs have unique allosteric signatures. As experimental validation, we show that targeted mutations at residues with varying sequence conservation but high network connectivity modulate enzyme catalysis, including a surprising enhancement of activity.

These cycles require conformational transitions of Hsp70 driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis. The ATPase activity of Hsp70 is controlled by J-domain protein (JDP) cochaperones, which allosterically stimulate ATP hydrolysis via interactions between their J-domains and Hsp70. The J-domain binds at the interface between the nucleotide (NBD) and substrate (SBD) binding domains of ATP bound Hsp70. Although, it was established that the JD interaction involves residues of helices II and III, and the interhelical loop critical for ATPase stimulation, the mechanism by which the allosteric signal induced by J-domain binding is transmitted to the distal nucleotide-binding pocket of Hsp70 remains unclear, as do the conformational changes leading to the ATP hydrolysis. Here, we addressed these questions by means of all-atom free energy simulations and dynamic network analysis, starting from the crystal structures of ATP-bound Hsp70 DnaK alone and in complex with the J-domain of DnaJ. We demonstrated that the presence of the J-domain results in the rearrangement of the nucleotide-binding pocket into a hydrolysis competent state, characterized by close contact between universally conserved T199 of NBD and {gamma}-phosphate of ATP. With network analysis we revealed that the allosteric signal for this rearrangement is transmitted along the {beta}-strand containing T199. Finally, we provide rationale for the signal transmission, where steric repulsion between the J-domain's helix III and SBD induces a push of the T199 containing {beta}-strand. Overall, our study provides mechanistic insights into allosteric signal transmission within Hsp70, bridging the gap between J-domain binding and ATPase stimulation.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

While there is clear evidence for age-related changes in the quantity of muscle spindles and in their sensitivity, behavioral assessment of age-related changes in position sense have produced mixed findings. Yet, study results are difficult to compare since there is no golden standard for assessment of proprioception. Therefore, we measured upper limb proprioception across several standard proprioceptive tasks together with key factors that could influence behavioral results such as touch, motor function, and cognition in 37 young (19-32 years old) and 35 older (53-71 years old) adults. We tested age-related differences in behavioral outcomes and their associations across tasks. Our results showed that age-related effects were very variable across position sense tasks, ranging from tasks where older participants performed better to tasks where they exhibit large age-related differences in position sense. These results were confirmed by meta-analysis based on data from hundreds of participants tested in our laboratory on the exact same tasks. Even within a task, different outcomes exhibit opposite age-related effects. Associations between outcome variables across or within proprioceptive tasks were overall negligible to weak. In conclusion, age-related changes in proprioception are limited, task- and outcome- dependent, and current tasks used to assess proprioception do not provide consistent evidence of age- related impairment in upper limb proprioception.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

We used inhibitors for G9A/GLP that catalyzes methylation of H3K9, for EZH2 that catalyzes trimethylation of H3K27, and compared them to the actions of inhibitors of LSD1 and HDAC. All the inhibitors decondense chromatin and all preserve, to different extents, retinas from degeneration in rd10 mice, but they act through different metabolic pathways. One group of inhibitors, modifiers for LSD1 and EZH2, demonstrate a high level of maintenance of rod-specific transcripts, activation of Ca+2 and Wnt signaling pathways with inhibition of antigen processing and presentation, immune response and microglia phagocytosis. Another group of inhibitors, modifiers for HDAC and G9A/GLP work through upregulation of NGF-stimulated transcription, while down-regulating genes belong to immune response, extracellular matrix, cholesterol signaling and programmed cell death.

Male and female mice, 1.5-5.5 month (young) and 9-13.5 month (adult), homozygous for human APOE4 or APOE3, were scanned using an 11.1 Tesla MRI scanner. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed, and images were processed and analyzed, followed by a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) protocol to test contextual memory. Functional imaging revealed decreases in various functional network measures and decreased network development for APOE4 adults as well as significant differences between groups in brain activity in motor, sensory, memory, and emotional processing related regions. APOE3 adult mice showed increasing network complexity with aging. DTI-based fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with age independent of genotype. Behaviorally APOE4 adult mice experienced contextual memory dysfunction relative to other groups. No sex differences were observed. The results suggest that in APOE4 adult mice there may be a link of network connectivity changes with increases in fear behavior and a decreased ability to recognize contextual changes. Furthermore, the lack of network development in aging APOE4 mice is indicative of a loss of functional network resilience in the brains of AD-susceptible individuals.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

However, CreER activation under the control of vascular endothelial promoters is now recognized to cause off-target effects that impair angiogenesis in the widely used perinatal mouse retina model. Although ubiquitously expressed CreER is also used to study retinal angiogenesis, it remains unknown whether it causes similar or more severe off-target effects compared to endothelial-selective CreER activation. Moreover, the cellular processes disrupted by CreER-induced endothelial toxicity remain to be identified. Here, we demonstrate that ubiquitous CreER activation in postnatal mice decreases body growth throughout the period of retinal angiogenesis and impairs retinal angiogenesis in a tamoxifen dose-dependent manner. We further show that CreER activation from both endothelial and ubiquitously expressed CreER transgenes suppresses endothelial cell proliferation downstream of p21/CDKNA1 upregulation. By contrast, we find that p21/CDKNA1 is not upregulated in quiescent adult retinal endothelium, and that CreER-induced postnatal angiogenesis defects recover two weeks after tamoxifen discontinuation. Altogether, our findings indicate that ubiquitous promoters should be avoided for CreER expression when studying endothelial genes, and that short-term retinal angiogenesis studies require endothelial CreER toxicity controls that may be less critical for adult vascular studies.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

To further investigate this, we used in situ hybridization (ISH) to examine the expression of a selected set of markers in normal and left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) mouse models. In developing mouse ventricles, the expression of key marker genes was largely restricted to two wide myocardial domains, compact and trabecular myocardium, suggesting a less complex regional organization than human fetal heart. Other markers labelled endocardial and coronary endothelial cells rather than cardiomyocytes, differing from patterns observed in the human heart. In the LVNC model, various markers exhibited altered spatial expression, indicating that precise regional organization of gene expression is critical for normal ventricular wall maturation.

However, the molecular factors that maintain cellular plasticity through the regulation of a hybrid cell state (epithelial/mesenchymal) are not fully defined. As LMO2 has been previously shown to regulate metastasis, here we determined the role of LMO2 in the normal mammary epithelial cells. Using lineage tracing and knockout mouse models we find that Lmo2 lineage-traced cells persist long-term in the mammary gland, both in the luminal and basal layer but have limited proliferative potential. Lmo2 loss does not impact mammary gland development, but acute deletion decreases in vivo reconstitution. Moreover, LMO2 knockdown in mouse and human mammary epithelial cells (MECs) reduces organoid formation. We find that LMO2 maintains a hybrid cell state in MECs and LMO2 knockdown promotes mesenchymal differentiation. Transcriptional profiling of LMO2 knockdown cells reveals significant enrichment in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and upregulation of MCAM, a negative regulator of regenerative capacity in the mammary gland.

We investigated a hybrid zone between the white-collared manakin (Manacus candei) and the golden-collared manakin (M. vitellinus), two lek-breeding species characteristic of lowland forest habitat in Central America. Despite evidence of asymmetrical introgression and selection on male secondary sexual traits, ongoing sampling indicates that this hybrid zone is spatially stable with narrow clines, thus implying selection against hybrids. To evaluate hybrid viability, we estimated two components of hybrid fitness: survival of adults and egg hatching rates, and a possible selective pressure: prevalence of parasitism by vector-borne haemosporidian parasites. Estimated survival was similar between parental and hybrid populations and the prevalence of infections by Plasmodium spp. or Haemoproteus spp. parasites was uniformly low. Estimated rates of hatching success, however, were lower in nests from our hybrid population (one or two eggs failed to hatch in 70% of nests) compared to nests at the parental species (M. candei 28.6% and M. vitellinus 19.0%). Thus, despite extensive admixture and clear evidence of introgression of male plumage traits under sexual selection, partial infertility or elevated rates of developmental mortality in hybrid offspring may underlie long-term stability in this hybrid zone.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

By varying the level of genetic specificity required for infection while controlling for the average infection rate, we induce coevolutionary cycles and examine their effects on virulence evolution.

Using 285 recently published genomes from drosophilid species, we investigated the evolutionary origins of the ~130 TE families present in D. melanogaster and found that 79 were exchanged via horizontal transposon transfer (HTT) with other drosophilids. Most HTT events involved closely related species such as D. sechellia, D. mauritiana, and D. teissieri, although transfers from more distantly related taxa were also observed. Notably, D. melanogaster appears to be a net recipient of HTTs, acquiring about three times as many TEs as it donated. Geographic patterns reveal that most HTTs involved Afrotropical species, reflecting D. melanogaster's ancestral range, with fewer involving species from the Neotropics, a region which D. melanogaster invaded only ~200 years ago. Despite colonizing the Nearctic, Australasian, and Palearctic regions between 200-2000 years ago, we found no evidence of HTT with species from those areas. Nonetheless, an analysis of drosophilids from each biogeographic realm shows that HTT is widespread in each realm, with 3-55% of the genome in each species derived from HTT. Strikingly, a considerable portion of the genome is shared among all species inhabiting the same realm --regardless of phylogenetic distance-- indicating that geographic overlap, rather than shared ancestry, is a primary driver of TE composition.

Our analysis of the individual and collective breathing patterns supported by stochastic individual-based simulations of inherently non-periodic coupled oscillators revealed that this degree of collective synchronization could be achieved by having some kind of assortative interaction rules where individuals respond towards one cluster/subgroup members stronger than to other cluster/subgroup members.

Throughput can be increased by multiplexing samples in the mass domain with plexDIA, yet multiplexing along one dimension will only linearly scale throughput with plex. To enable combinatorial-scaling of proteomics throughput we developed a complementary multiplexing strategy in the time domain, termed `timePlex'. timePlex staggers and overlaps the separation periods of individual samples. This strategy is orthogonal to isotopic multiplexing, which enables combinatorial multiplexing in mass and time domains when paired together and thus multiplicatively increased throughput. We demonstrate this with 3-timePlex and 3-plexDIA, enabling the multiplexing of 9 samples per LC-MS run, and 3-timePlex and 9-plexDIA exceeding 500 samples / day with a combinatorial 27-plex. Crucially, timePlex supports sensitive analyses, including of single cells.

To enhance sequence identification and quantification from such spectra, we developed an open source software for Joint Modeling of mass spectra: JMod. It uses the intrinsic structure in the spectra and explicitly models overlapping peaks as linear superpositions of their components. This modeling enabled performing 9-plexDIA using 2 Da offset PSMtags by deconvolving the resulting overlapping isotopic envelopes in both MS1 and MS2 space. The results demonstrate 9-fold higher throughput with preserved quantitative accuracy and coverage depth. This support for smaller mass offsets increases multiplexing capacity and thus proteomic throughput for a given plexDIA tag, and we demonstrate this generalizability with diethyl labeling.

F.; wang, z.", "abstract": "BackgroundSteroid 5-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) is a key enzyme in androgen metabolism and a pharmacologic target in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). While SRD5A2 is known to mediate stromal-epithelial interactions that influence prostate growth, the relationship between baseline SRD5A2 expression and prostate volume remains unclear.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed SRD5A2 expression in human prostate tissues from two independent cohorts: the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) trial and an institutional biorepository. Quantitative assessments were performed using immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, ELISA, and western blotting. Correlations were evaluated between SRD5A2 expression, WNT5A expression, prostate volume, and tissue signaling profiles. Functional validation was performed in a Srd5a2-null mouse model and through mechanistic studies using stromal cell SRD5A2-overexpression systems.\n\nResultsSRD5A2 expression was significantly associated with total prostate and transition zone volume in both human cohorts. Stromal-specific WNT5A expression showed a strong positive correlation with SRD5A2, while neither serum nor tissue dihydrotestosterone levels correlated with SRD5A2 expression. In Srd5a2-null mice, Wnt5a expression in the prostate stroma was dependent on Srd5a2 and showed region-specific regulation. Mechanistically, SRD5A2 overexpression in stromal cells upregulated WNT5A and Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1 (LEF1), activated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling, increased proliferation, and reduced apoptosis. Conditioned media from these cells enhanced epithelial proliferation through paracrine IGF1 activity, independent of epithelial WNT signaling.\n\nConclusionThis study provides the first evidence that SRD5A2 promotes prostate growth through a stromal WNT5A-LEF1-IGF1 paracrine signaling axis, functioning independently of androgen levels. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic mechanism relevant for BPH patients with resistance to conventional 5-reductase inhibitor therapy.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

H.; Guilak, F.", "abstract": "Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating joint disease characterized by cartilage degeneration, synovial inflammation, and bone remodeling, with limited therapeutic options targeting the underlying pathophysiology. Mechanosensitive ion channels Piezo1 and Piezo2 play crucial roles in chondrocyte responses to mechanical stress, mediating mechanotransduction pathways that influence chondrocyte survival, matrix production, and inflammatory signaling, but their distinct contributions to OA pathogenesis remain unclear. Methods: Using inducible, chondrocyte-specific Aggrecan-Cre (Acan) mice, we investigated Piezo1, Piezo2, and combined Piezo1/2 conditional knockouts (cKOs) using the destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model of post-traumatic OA in male and female mice. Pain and behavioral assessments were conducted at four time points to evaluate OA progression, while cartilage damage, bone remodeling, and synovial inflammation were assessed at the final endpoint of 28 weeks. Statistical analyses included one-way and two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Results: Piezo1 cKO delayed pain onset but ultimately exacerbated cartilage degradation and synovitis, emphasizing its dual role in protective and pathogenic mechanotransduction. While the Piezo2 cKO reduced pain and preserved activity, it failed to protect cartilage. Notably, Piezo1/2 cKO provided the greatest protection against cartilage degeneration, synovitis, and pain. Micro-computed tomography analyses revealed that Piezo2 is critical for maintaining trabecular bone integrity, with a Piezo2 cKO leading to decreased bone volume, thickness, and density, independent of injury. Piezo2 cKO also reduced normal meniscal ossification that occurs with age in mice. In contrast, a Piezo1/2 cKO normalized most bone remodeling parameters observed in Piezo2 cKO mice but did not restore medial tibial plateau thickness, highlighting Piezo2's essential role in bone structure. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the overlapping and compensatory roles of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in OA pathogenesis. Dual inhibition of Piezo1 and Piezo2 may offer a novel, effective therapeutic strategy targeting both structural and symptomatic aspects of the disease.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

F.; Turner, J. A.; van Erp, T.; Ford, J.; Calhoun, V.", "abstract": "The human brain operates as a complex system where functional networks evolve and interact across spatially distributed regions. In traditional neuroimaging analyses, functional connectivity (FC), based on pairwise correlations or statistical dependencies of temporal fluctuations in the BOLD signal, has been a primary method for exploring interactions between brain regions and decoding brain function. However, traditional FC methods often overlook the intricate, multi-way interplay among brain elements that emerge from the brain's densely interconnected nature. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel voxel-centric framework that captures the multi-way interactions between voxels and networks identified via high-model order independent component analysis. This framework posits that individual voxels serve as critical mediators of multi-network communication, reflecting the brain's complex functional architecture. By encoding voxel contributions from brain networks into binary representations and quantifying the population count at each voxel via Hamming weights, the proposed method prioritizes high-contribution voxels that facilitate inter-network interactions. This approach provides new insights into the brain's functional organization, revealing previously unrecognized patterns of voxel-to-network entanglement. Specifically, in the context of schizophrenia, our method enables the identification of spatial patterns that may underpin the cognitive and perceptual disturbances characteristic of the disorder. This enhanced understanding could improve diagnostic precision and help tailor interventions that target specific dysfunctional networks, offering a pathway to more effective treatments and better patient outcomes in schizophrenia.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

M.; Budak, M.; Fausto, B. A.; Elahi, F.; Gluck, M. A.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins years before symptoms appear, making early detection essential. The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is one of the earliest regions affected, and its network flexibility, a dynamic measure of brain connectivity, may serve as a sensitive biomarker of early decline. Cognitive (acquisition, generalization), genetic (APOE, ABCA7), and biochemical (P-tau217) markers may predict MTL dynamic flexibility. Given the high rate of missing data in AD research, this study uses machine learning with advanced imputation methods to predict MTL dynamic flexibility from multimodal predictors in an aging cohort. METHODS: In an ongoing study at Rutgers's Aging and Brain Health Alliance, data from 656 participants are utilized, including cognitive assessments, genetic and blood-derived biomarkers, and demographics. Due to MRI-related constraints, only 34.15% of participants had measurable MTL dynamic flexibility from resting-state fMRI. To estimate MTL dynamic flexibility from available data, we evaluated four missing data handling methods (case deletion, MICE, MissForest, and GAIN), and trained five regression models: Ridge, k-NN, SVR, regression trees (bagging, random forest, boosting), and ANN. Hyperparameters were optimized via grid search with 3-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and runtime through 5-fold cross-validation repeated 25 times to ensure robustness in clinical data settings. RESULTS: A total of 1,866 missing values (25.86%) were identified in the dataset, with only 42 complete cases (6.40%) remaining after listwise deletion, highlighting the need for effective imputation. In the initial analysis using only complete cases, support vector regression (SVR) achieved the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 0.184), though overall performance was limited due to small sample size. In the second phase, three imputation techniques were applied, significantly improving model accuracy. MissForest combined with Random Forest produced the best results (MAE = 0.083), representing a 54.7% improvement over case deletion. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in performance across imputation methods (p < 0.001), with MissForest outperforming GAIN and MICE. GAIN was the fastest imputation method. DISCUSSION: The findings underscore the importance of using robust imputation strategies to maximize data utility and model reliability in studies with high missingness. Further research is needed, particularly incorporating additional neuroimaging measures, to localize the brain regions most affected by biomarker-driven changes and to refine predictive models for clinical applications.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

P.; Shetler, C.; Penrose, K. J.; Jaiswal, D. S.; Chu, X.; Li, W.; Kearney, M. F.; Mellors, J. W.; Halvas, E. K.", "abstract": "Despite adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), low levels of plasma virus persist in most individuals with HIV-1. In a small subset of these individuals, this non-suppressible viremia is detected by routine clinical testing (plasma HIV-1 RNA >20 copies/ml) and has been shown to be of clonal cellular origin. The mechanisms by which these virions escape immune clearance is not defined, but reduced binding and neutralization of their surface envelope protein (Env) by antibodies (Abs) may contribute. To assess this possibility, we measured the monoclonal antibody (mAb) sensitivity of HIV-1 Env in plasma virus from 4 well-characterized individuals on ART with non-suppressible viremia. Thirty-two env plasma sequences were used to produce pseudovirus for neutralization assays with both autologous plasma and a panel of 15 recombinant antibodies that targeted different regions of HIV-1 Env protein. We found that autologous plasma had no neutralizing activity against the pseudoviruses consistent with persistence of viremia. In general, the Envs from the non-suppressible plasma virus were also less sensitive to mAb neutralization compared controls: tier 1 (6535), tier 2 (TRO11) or tier 3 (PVO) subtype B envs, although variability across Envs was evident. Two Env protein variants from one donor, R-09_A8 and R-09_C2, were less sensitive to VRC01 likely due to an additional N-glycan site at a VRC01 contact site and longer V5 regions. Most of the donor Envs were sensitive to at least two of three V3-glycan mAbs except for variant C-03_A6, which showed reduced sensitivity to all three. The CD4 binding site mAb 3BNC117 and the Gp41-specific mAb 10E8 neutralized pseudoviruses from all donors, indicating the potential for clearance of persistent viremia in these individuals studied.\n\nAuthor summaryIn a fraction of individuals on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), episodes of persistent low-level viremia can be observed that is not attributed to ineffective ART and/or non-adherence. Previously in three individuals, we have shown that this viremia results from large HIV-1 infected T cell clones harboring replication-competent proviruses. The factor(s) that allow these infectious virions to be detected and not cleared by the immune system is unknown, suggesting that these virions can evade humoral responses. Using single genome sequencing, we amplified the env from plasma derived virions from these individuals, cloned env -containing amplicons into an expression vector to produce pseudo viruses, which we tested against either their autologous contemporaneous autologous immunoglobulins (Ig) or a panel of 15 recombinant monoclonal antibodies. The results revealed that these pseudovirus were not neutralized by their autologous Igs and exhibited complex pseudovirus-specific susceptibility profiles for the monoclonal antibodies they were tested against. Collectively, our findings suggest that despite resistance to autologous Ig, likely combinations of monoclonal antibodies will be needed to clear this persistent viremia.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

A. A.", "abstract": "Background Renewable energy production is being developed worldwide to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and thereby moderate the rate of anthropogenic climate change. Harnessing wind energy, using wind turbines, is a prominent form of renewable energy production. There are, however, biodiversity impacts, including collisions by birds and bats with rotating blades. High levels of mortalities can cause localised and species-level population declines, which is especially significant for threatened species. The height at which species fly is a key collision risk factor. In this study we investigated the flight height patterns of a critically endangered bat to inform mitigations to reduce impacts. Methods We captured and GPS tagged 244 Southern Bent-wing Bats (Miniopterus orianae bassanii) (14 to 19 g) in south-eastern Australia, in spring and late summer/early autumn. We retrieved 93 units, yielding 4,289 bat observations from an 18 to 21 day period in each season. The vertical measurement error of the GPS units at different heights and sampling intervals was investigated with drone test flights. A Bayesian state-space modelling approach was then developed to estimate flight height distributions while accounting for measurement error. Results Our results suggest that the majority of bat activity occurs between ground level and 30 m altitude, at least in early spring and late summer/early autumn. However, the bats were recorded taking short flights above 60 m and at times even flew above 80 m (maximum model estimate was 92.7 m with a maximum 95% CI of 144.1 m) and demonstrated that they are capable of quick and frequent altitudinal changes from ground level to almost 40 m. Flight heights were on average higher when associated with trees in summer. Mean flight heights appear to be higher when associated with treed habitats in summer. Conclusions This study shows that the flight height distribution of small bats can be investigated using store-on-board GPS devices and illustrates a statistical approach that incorporates vertical measurement error. It provides the first insights into the flight heights of this small bat species, which can help inform a more complete flight height profile across different seasons and conditions with future improvements in GPS technology. Results suggest that, although the Southern Bent-wing Bat primarily flies at lower heights, it exceeds 30 m altitude at times, increasing the risk of mortalities due to wind turbine collision. Accurately determining the proportion of time that threatened species such as the Southern Bent-wing Bats spend within high-risk flight zones will provide the evidence base for implementing effective mitigation measures to reduce population-level impacts.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

The single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome encodes for one large polyprotein which is processed by viral and cell-derived proteases into 12 mature proteins. Besides its protein-coding function, the RNA genome also contains RNA secondary structures with critical importance for various stages of the viral life cycle. Some of those RNA secondary structures, like the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and a 3' stem-loop essential for genome replication, had already been studied for a few individual pestiviruses. In this study, we provide the first genome-wide multiple sequence alignment (MSA) including all known pestivirus species (accepted and tentative). Moreover, we performed a comprehensive analysis of RNA secondary structures phylogenetically conserved across the complete genus. While showing well-described structures, like a 5' stem-loop structure, the IRES element, and the 3' stem loop SLI to be conserved between all pestiviruses, other RNA secondary structures in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) were only conserved in subsets of the species. We identified 29 novel phylogenetically conserved RNA secondary structures in the protein-coding region, with so far unresolved functional importance. The microRNA binding site for miR-17 was previously known in species A, B, and C; in this study, we identified it in ten additional species, but not in species K, S, Q, and R.

Importantly, we observed increases in Stat1, Irf1 and interferon-stimulated genes such as Igtp in Th1 cells, leading to upregulation of interferon related gene expression for antiviral response by BCG immunization. Activated transcription factors like Irf1 in CD4+ T cells promotes Il12rb1 expression to facilitate IL-12 signaling and drive naive CD4+ T cells differentiation into Th1 cells.

V.; Vasudevan, K.", "abstract": "Conventional cancer treatments tend to have serious side effects, leading to the quest for safer and more specific treatment modalities. Immunotherapy with vaccines has appeared as a promising option, with B-cell epitopes being crucial for the generation of humoral immunity. But identification of the correct B-cell epitopes of cancer is a severe challenge since current tools are not pre-trained with cancer-generated datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEpitope, a command-line tool based on deep learning designed exclusively for the prediction of linear B-cell epitopes from cancer antigens. We compiled a high-quality dataset from the Cancer Epitope Database and used Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) embeddings to represent epitope and non-epitope sequences as vectors of 1280 dimensions. These embeddings were employed to train five machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Naive Bayes) and three deep learning models (Multilayer Perceptron [MLP], Convolutional Neural Network, and Bidirectional LSTM). Of these, the MLP model performed best with an AUC of 0.85 and a benchmark AUC of 94%. In comparison with other tools like BepiPred (60%) and LBtope (54%), DeepEpitope demonstrated much higher predictive accuracy.

R.; Ghimire, S.; Fletcher, T.; Stern, J.

While insulin resistance is a key driver of metabolic disease in aging, glucagon signaling is equally critical in maintaining both glucose and lipid homeostasis, particularly during exercise. Previous studies have established the glucagon sensitizing effects of exercise training in younger animals. Most studies in rodents employ rigorous and carefully dosed forced exercise protocols. This forced exercise is a stressful paradigm. We implemented a voluntary wheel running (VWR) intervention to assess the effects of aging and exercise training on glucagon sensitivity. We initiated 12-weeks of VWR in young adult (6-month-old) and middle-aged (12-month-old) C57BL/6NCrl male mice. Glucagon sensitivity, as assessed by glucagon stimulated hyperglycemia, was decreased in middle-aged compared to young adult sedentary mice (P=0.046). While VWR did not affect glucose clearance, circulating insulin, glucagon, or insulin sensitivity, regardless of age, VWR improved glucagon responsivity only in middle-aged mice (P=0.031). VWR increased hepatic glycogen content and increased glucagon-stimulated glycogen depletion, regardless of age (P<0.01). Results from these studies suggest that exercise training can enhance liver glucagon action in aging mice without otherwise altering glucose homeostasis.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Mutations in the myosin binding protein C3 (MYBPC3) gene account for a significant proportion of HCM cases. However, many of these variants are classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS), complicating clinical decision-making. Scalable methods for variant interpretation in disease-specific cell types are crucial for understanding variant impact and uncovering disease mechanisms.\n\nMethodsWe developed a scaled multidimensional mapping strategy to evaluate the functional impact of variants across a critical domain of MYBPC3. We incorporate saturation base editing at the native MYBPC3 locus, a long-read RNA sequencing-enabled assay of variant splice effects, and measurements of HCM-relevant phenotypes, including MYBPC3 abundance, hypertrophic signaling, and ubiquitin-proteasome function in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs).\n\nResultsOur multidimensional mapping strategy enabled high-resolution functional analysis of MYBPC3 variants in iPSC-CMs. Targeted transient base editing generated a comprehensive variant library at the native locus, capturing diverse variant effects on cellular HCM-relevant phenotypes. Our massively parallel splicing assay identified novel splice-disrupting variants. Integration of functional assays revealed that decreased MYBPC3 abundance is a key driver of HCM-related phenotypes. In parallel, downregulation of protein degradation was observed as a compensatory response to MYBPC3 loss of function, and novel disease mechanisms were identified for missense variants near a critical binding domain, underscoring their contribution to pathogenesis. Bayesian estimates of variant effects enable the reclassification of clinical variants.\n\nConclusionsThis work provides a platform for extending genome engineering in iPSCs to multiplexed assays of variant effects across diverse disease-relevant cellular phenotypes, enhancing the understanding of variant pathogenicity and uncovering novel biological mechanisms that could inform therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

K. pneumoniae is largely transmitted in healthcare settings, where inpatients and outpatients are often anesthetized with the ubiquitously-used anesthetic induction agent propofol. Recent evidence indicates that propofol exposure can dramatically increase host susceptibility to microbial infections. Given that intubated patients are often given propofol and are at risk for K. pneumoniae lung infections, we investigated the outcome of K. pneumoniae infections in mice briefly sedated with either propofol or ketamine/xylazine as control. Propofol-sedated mice experienced more rapid dissemination from the lungs to secondary sites of infection and developed more severe lung pathology. Based on these observations, we investigated bacterial factors involved in infection and dissemination in mice with and without propofol sedation using a high throughput insertion sequencing (INSeq) approach. We identified numerous novel potential virulence factors together with previously identified gene products, confirming the validity of our screen. We further identified insertion mutants with differing degrees of attenuation dependent upon sedation method.

Notably, the intra-erythrocytic parasite development is highly dependent on a sustained supply of glucose as their fundamental energy source. Therefore, exploiting a \"selective starvation\" strategy, by targeting the parasite's reliance on glucose metabolism, particularly through the Plasmodium falciparum hexose transporter (PfHT1), which is critical for parasite survival can serve as a promising therapeutic approach to combat multidrug-resistant Plasmodium parasites. Through molecular docking and structure-based drug design approach, we identified a natural compound, Ginsenoside Rg1 (G-Rg1) from drug bank database library, as a potential PfHT1 inhibitor. The PfHT1 specificity of G-Rg1 was validated using yeast complementation model. Subsequently, to investigate the role of PfHT1 in drug resistant Pf parasites we investigated the stage-specific expression of PfHT1 in both artemisinin (ART)-sensitive and resistant Pf parasites and reported its elevated expression in resistant parasites, predicting its role in their survival. Notably, in vitro growth inhibition studies demonstrated that G-Rg1 effectively suppressed the growth of both ART-sensitive and resistant Pf parasites. Additionally, G-Rg1 potentiated the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin in combination and ring survival assays, indicating its potential to circumvent resistance mechanisms.

Using multimodal stressors, including mechanical (ultrasonication/agitation), physical (hyperthermia), and biological (oxidative damage), we demonstrate that stress-modified sEVs exhibit high-affinity binding to small A {beta} ; aggregates (SA) through scaffold reorganization, as validated by super-resolution microscopy and quantitative colocalization assays. Crucially, these remodelled sEVs act as potent carriers, enhancing SA internalization by neuronal cells in vitro. Strikingly, in post-mortem Alzheimer' s disease (AD) brains and APP-PS1 transgenic mice, sEVs were spatially enriched at amyloid plaque margins, suggesting a direct role in A {beta} ; sequestration and plaque expansion. Consistent with clinical relevance, sEVs isolated from AD patients exhibited an intrinsic SA-binding capacity, recapitulating stress-induced interactions observed experimentally.

Our previous work revealed increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion and mitochondrial damages in the lungs of asthmatic mice, implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in disease pathogenesis. Given that mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is essential for mtDNA maintenance and integrity, we hypothesized that TFAM has a fundamental role in regulating mtDNA stress and downstream inflammtroy response in asthma. Using myeloid-specific TFAM knockout (TFAMfl/flLysMcre, TFAM KO) mice subjected to allergens sensitization and challenge, we observed pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction and accentuated asthmatic inflammation. This was accompanied by elevated expression of asthma-associated mediators, including il-13, muc5a/c, muc5b, and ccl17. In addition, TFAM deficiency was associated with increased eosinophilia and and cytosolic mtDNA release, contributing to exacerbated airway pathology.

While there is substantial knowledge about the diversity and activity of viruses infecting photoautotrophic primary producers, little is known about viruses infecting chemoautotrophs, representing a gap in our understanding of key microbial processes driving global carbon cycles. Here, we combine metagenomics with 12/13C stable isotopic probing mesocosm experiments in a marine-derived meromictic pond to quantify lineage-specific carbon cycling activity to identify key microbial populations driving carbon cycling. We then tracked the flow of carbon from active chemoautotrophs to their viruses and found evidence supporting virus-mediated recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass through the production of viral particles. In particular, active populations of hydrogen/sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophs (Thiomicrorhabdus, Hydrogenovibrio, Sulfurimonas, Sulfurovum) were targeted by viruses.

The spectrum of antiviral activity of IFITMs is largely determined by their subcellular localization. IFITM1 localizes to and primarily blocks viral fusion at the plasma membrane, while IFITM3 prevents viral fusion in late endosomes by accumulating in these compartments. We have previously reported that cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment relieves the fusion block for the Influenza A virus, likely by relocating IFITM1 and IFITM3 from the plasma membrane and endosomes, respectively, to the Golgi area. Here, we report the existence of at least two distinct pools of IFITMs in CsA treated cells. While immunostaining of CsA treated cells using mild permeabilization agents, such as digitonin, suggests preferential IFITM localization at the Golgi apparatus, a harsher permeabilization protocol reveals a large, previously unidentified pool of IFITMs in late endosomes. Notably, IFITM redistribution was not associated with its degradation. A disproportionate loss of antibody access to the cytoplasmic N-terminus compared to the extracellular C-terminus of IFITMs after CsA treatment is consistent with sequestration of the N-terminal domain inside intraluminal vesicles of late endosomes. Accordingly, super-resolution microscopy reveals that CsA induces IFITM3 redistribution from the periphery to the interior of late endosomes. Together, our results imply that IFITMs relocate to intraluminal vesicles of late endosomes in the presence of CsA, thereby enabling viral fusion with the limiting membrane of these compartments.

Efforts to mitigate climate change have had limited success, emphasizing the need to address local stressors to prevent biodiversity collapse. However, measuring biodiversity remains complex due to its multifaceted nature, including taxonomic, functional, and interaction dimensions. This study introduces the Biodiversity State Indicator (BSI), an integrated metric designed to assess biodiversity by combining classic taxonomic biodiversity with functional biodiversity and community interactions. The BSI calculates the state of biodiversity at a target site, compared to reference ecosystems, enabling the indicator to assess net-positive or net-negative biodiversity change. The indicator is validated through simulations and applied to North Sea data, demonstrating its sensitivity to species richness and its capacity to track biodiversity changes over time. The BSI was shown to perform accordingly to expectation, showing no preference for a specific metric included in the calculations. Additionally, the BSI showed that while giving a clear and simple number to communicate and relate state of biodiversity and biodiversity changes, resolving the calculations into its constituent components can assist in resolving some of the internal ecosystem dynamics by levering changes in taxonomic, functional and interaction diversity with each other. In conclusion, the Biodiversity State Indicator can be a solid tool to assist in the net-positive strategy of marine stakeholders, developers and decision makers", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Investigating how bat species' diets vary across landscapes is crucial for understanding bat ecology and their role in ecosystem health. Here, we characterised the predator-prey interactions of two common bat species with different foraging strategies, the Brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and Soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus), across the unique pastureland dominated landscape of Ireland. Over three years (2021-2023), faecal samples (n=4,627 in total) were collected annually at three time points (gestation, lactation, post-lactation) from twelve maternity roosts and analysed using metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing. Both bat species showed broad diet diversity, with 392 and 350 arthropod species identified for Brown long-eared bat and Soprano pipistrelle, respectively, primarily Lepidoptera and Diptera. The Brown long-eared bat exhibited a generalist diet demonstrating dietary flexibility. Lepidoptera interactions were more frequent overall (62%) compared to Diptera (31%), but interactions with Diptera species increased markedly at one specific roost, highlighting its capacity to adjust its diet to local prey availability. In contrast, the Soprano pipistrelle exhibited a more specialised diet, with 83% consisting of Diptera species. Both spatial and temporal factors significantly influenced dietary richness and composition in both species. Surrounding land cover, in particular, played an important role in shaping diet composition. Our findings suggest that the Brown long-eared bat exhibits a broad foraging strategy, acting as a generalist with a preference for Lepidoptera, while the Soprano pipistrelle shows a consistent reliance on Diptera. This study underscores the reliance of two widespread bat species, which play an important role in ecosystem well-being, on diverse insect taxa, highlighting the urgent need to conserve these insect populations.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Humans (Homo sapiens) have adapted to cope with a wide range of climatic conditions, however the role of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in mediating this process remains poorly understood. Here we curated a dataset of 23,790 publicly available full human mitochondrial genomes, an approximate 40-fold increase on earlier studies, paired with modern climate and reconstructed paleoclimate variables. Using a Generalised Linear Model approach, we identify 18 independent candidate variants significantly associated with climatic conditions, suggesting local adaptation in human mitochondrial genomes. Candidate variants are distributed across multiple loci in regulatory, tRNA, rRNA and protein-coding regions - including prominently in ND2 and ND4 complex I subunits. Specific variants are predicted to impact mtDNA transcription, ribosome or protein structure, and multiple have been associated with disease pathologies. We further show that candidate variant genotype distributions are each best modelled by different paleo-bioclimatic variables, consistent with environmental stressors linked to our measured variables exerting subtly distinct selective effects. These stressors may reflect dietary changes or different thermogenic demands at lower temperatures. Our results provide genetic evidence to support the accumulating body of work from functional studies that mitochondria can modulate adaptation to diverse environments.

Hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) production remains inefficient, precluded by knowledge gaps related to specification and morphogenesis of specialized hemogenic endothelial cells, which undergo an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) to form HPCs. We elected to define changes in gene expression and chromatin organization during HPC formation to reveal regulatory mechanisms. Using paired single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing together with Hi-C, we profiled cells before and after EHT. Pathway analysis and pseudotime inferences confirmed a continuum of stromal and endothelial cells undergoing development into HE cells and lineage-based HPCs in vitro. In these cell types, we characterize cis-regulatory elements and transcriptional regulatory activities that facilitate EHT and HPC homeostasis, including for SNAI1, SOX17, TGFb, STAT4, as well as for GFI1b and KLF1 in megakaryocyte- and erythroid-biased progenitors, respectively. We then leveraged our insights into chromatin organization among in vitro-derived cells to assess enrichments corresponding to human trait variation reported in human genome wide association studies. HPCs revealed locus enrichment for quantitative blood traits and autoimmune disease predisposition, which were particularly enriched in myeloid- and lymphoid-biased populations.

DWV is known to replicate in the honey bee brain and has been documented as both improving and impairing olfactory learning and memory. We examined the transcriptomic response of the honey bee mushroom bodies--an area of the insect brain associated with higher cognitive functions--in bees with naturally occurring DWV infections who varied in their ability to perform an associative learning task. RNA-seq analysis detected increased expression of genes involved in the immune response, including important antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as hymenoptaecin, apidaecin, and abaecin, and the down-regulation of lysozyme, PPO, and other genes associated with responses to a range of stressors. Additionally, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed overrepresentation of key bio-logical processes which form part of the immune response. We also noted significant differential expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) presumed to be acting in a regulatory manner, and used these lncRNAs to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Strikingly, in contrast to previous studies on bees with artificially-induced infections that have examined viral loads in the abdomen and non-specific areas of the brain, no correlation between DWV load in the mushroom bodies and cognitive function was noted.

We developed a fully integrated, automated sample preparation platform that covers the entire process from biological sample input to mass spectrometry-ready peptide output and can be applied on a multitude of biological samples. With this end-to-end solution, we achieved high intra- and inter-plate reproducibility, as well as longitudinal consistency, resulting in precise and reproducible workflows.

Consequently, experimental structures of precatalytic states often require chemical modifications of the 2'-OH, such as its removal or methylation. However, the impact of these chemical modifications on the active site structure remains largely unexplored, which raises important questions since methylated structures are often taken as being representative of pre-catalytic states. Here, we employ extensive atomistic simulations critically compared to and fine-tuned on experimental data, and we revisit experimental results to show that 2'-O-methylation critically affects reactant geometries and, therefore, the possible reaction mechanisms inferred from the structures. Our results also challenge the common assumption that 2'-O-methylation stabilizes the C3'-endo puckering conformation. Our findings, consistent with recent experimental data on ribosome structure, reveal that this effect is highly sensitive to the local secondary structure and is often overstated. For three investigated small-cleaving ribozymes, the C2'-endo conformation observed for chemically-modified active site residues through 2'-O-methylation is not stable upon methyl group removal to obtain the catalytically-relevant hydroxylated state. This suggests that these geometries arise primarily from a combinaison of steric hindrances and electrostatic interactions with the surrounding environment rather than intrinsic conformational preferences of the ribose upon methylation.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Several copper-dependent proteins and enzymes produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis have been characterized. However, many questions remain about how copper is recognized and trafficked to metalate cuproproteins. The ycnKJI operon in B. subtilis encodes a suite of proteins implicated in copper uptake and regulation, including the copper-binding protein YcnI and the putative copper importer YcnJ. Here, we demonstrate that one of the extracellular domains within YcnJ (YcnJCopC) binds Cu(II) in 1:1 stoichiometry with high affinity using a histidine brace motif. Biochemical results reveal that YcnJCopC and YcnI can exchange Cu(II). Genetic studies reveal that loss of either YcnI or YcnJ, or mutation of the key residues required for Cu(II)-binding, leads to a growth defect under conditions of copper limitation. Together, these data suggest that the Cu(II)-binding sites in both YcnI and YcnJ contribute to efficient import under Cu limited conditions. Our results support a model in which YcnI may sequester Cu(II) from YcnJ, serving a regulatory role to limit the amount of copper that enters the cytoplasm and allowing Cu(II) to be stored for later import in the outer face of the membrane. This transfer of Cu(II) between extracellular domains of membrane-bound proteins represents a potential new paradigm in bacterial copper usage.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

In a murine model of urosepsis, we observed a substantial drop (40%) in circulating thrombocytes already 30 minutes after the introduction of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) and a concomitant transient increase in both platelet factor 4 release and thrombin-antithrombin complexes. This reduction in thrombocytes was timely associated with a reduction in circulating UPEC. By imaging flow cytometry, we visualized that eGFP-expressing UPEC was instantly bound to circulating thrombocytes, leading to the immediate removal of thrombocyte-UPEC complexes and a 95% reduction in bacterial load within 10 minutes. We demonstrate that thrombocyte-UPEC complexes are cleared primarily through the liver, engaging the sinusoidal endothelial cells. The majority of the UPEC are recovered in the liver, with minimal contribution from intravascular bacterial damage or lysis. The thrombocyte-dependent clearance system has a maximal capacity, and overload markedly challenges the intravascular UPEC-clearance. The data strongly suggest that circulating thrombocytes constitute the most important cell type for fast scavenging and clearance of invading bacteria during urosepsis and demonstrate that thrombocytopenia can be a direct function of bacteremia with UPEC.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

With respect to the bottom-up connections, however, these theories differ in the neural processing strategies suggested for updating the internal model. Some theories suggest a coding strategy where unpredictable inputs, i.e., those not captured by the internal model, are passed on through the cortical hierarchy, whereas others claim that the predictable part of the inputs is passed on. Here, we addressed which neural coding strategy is employed in cortico-cortical connections using an information-theoretic approach. Our framework allows for quantifying two core aspects of both strategies, namely, predictability of inputs and information transfer, through local active information storage and local transfer entropy, respectively. A previous study on the neural processing of retinal ganglion cells connected to the lateral geniculate nucleus showed a coding for predictable information, captured by an increase in the information transfer with the predictability of inputs. Here, we further investigate predictive coding strategies at the cortical level. In particular, we analyzed LFP activity obtained from intracranial EEG recordings in humans and spike recordings from mouse cortex. We detected cortico-cortical connections with increasing information transfer with the predictability of inputs in recorded channels from frontal, parietal and temporal areas in human cortex. In the mouse visual system, we detected connections exhibiting both an increase and decrease in the information transfer with input predictability, although the former was predominant. Our evidence supports the presence of both predictive coding strategies at the cortical level, with a potential predominance of encoding for predictable information.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

In this study, we employed urban runoff sediment as complex and environmentally realistic model stressor to investigate how multigenerational exposure affects fitness and potentially drives genomic adaptation in the freshwater midge Chironomus riparius. We combined an evolutionary life-cycle test with the Evolve and Resequence (E&R) approach, exposing replicate populations over seven generations to three treatments: an uncontaminated control and two concentrations of urban runoff sediment (0.5% and 10%). Key fitness traits, including mortality, mean emergence time (EmT50), fertility, and population growth rate (PGR), were measured, while allele frequency changes (AFC) were tracked to identify genomic signatures of selection. The results revealed distinct and non-linear fitness responses across treatments, including transgenerational effects, recovery of performance, and evidence of life-history trade-offs. Candidate haplotypes were enriched for genes involved in membrane transport, metabolism, and gene regulation, suggesting selection on general stress-response pathways consistent with polygenic adaptation.

We evaluated models through fine-tuning on downstream tasks and probing the structure of their latent spaces using simple classifiers and dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite similar performance on downstream tasks across model configurations, we observed substantial differences in the structure and interpretability of their internal representations.

Telomere erosion eventually activates the DNA damage response (DDR), inducing cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence or apoptosis. We previously reported that telomere dysfunction induces the transcription of telomeric non-coding RNAs (tncRNAs) which are critical mediators of DDR activation. Blocking tncRNAs with telomeric antisense oligonucleotides (tASOs) suppresses in vivo DDR signaling and its downstream effects. Here, we show that tASO-mediated inhibition of telomeric DDR in second-generation tert-/- zebrafish embryos with critically short telomeres leads to improved developmental outcomes and rescues premature aging phenotypes, including enhanced survival. Notably, a single tASO treatment administered at the one-cell stage of first-generation tert-/- embryos leads to enhanced fertility observed in 6-month-old adults. Overall, these findings demonstrate that tASO-based inhibition of telomeric DDR is sufficient to effectively rescue premature aging phenotypes in zebrafish.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

However, automated CBMA tools face challenges such as inconsistent terminology, limited ability to analyze long texts, and difficulty capturing semantic meaning, as they still rely on bag-of-words approaches. In addition, sparse coordinate reporting distorts the activation distribution due to incomplete data. This paper introduces NeuroConText, an automated CBMA tool that bridges neuroscience text, brain location coordinates, and brain images by creating a shared latent space for encoding text and brain maps. Our method relies on a multi-objective loss combining contrastive and reconstruction terms. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract neuroscientific information from full-text articles and employs an LLM-based text augmentation strategy to improve generalization to short-text inputs. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate NeuroConText's ability to enhance text-to-brain retrieval performance and reconstruct brain maps from neuroscience texts. We also show that CBMA tools can infer brain activations in regions discussed in articles but absent from reported coordinates, potentially addressing the challenge of sparse coordinate reporting.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

While the structure and function of eukaryotic histones are well-characterized, archaeal histones and their complexes with DNA require further scrutiny. Distinct from their eukaryotic counterparts, previously characterized canonical archaeal histones assemble on DNA into an \"endless\" superhelical nucleoprotein complex called a hypernucleosome. In this study, we explored whether hypernucleosome formation is a conserved feature of canonical archaeal histones. Moreover, to further elucidate how hypernucleosomes are regulated, we also explored how changes in the physico-chemical conditions, particularly the presence of Mg2+, influence the hypernucleosome. Using a combination of Tethered Particle Motion (TPM) and single-molecule force spectroscopy, we established that T. kodakarensis histones assemble into hypernucleosomes on DNA, similar to the M. fervidus histones HMfA and HMfB, the only canonical histones structurally characterized in previous studies. However, the effects of Mg2+ ions are distinct despite the histones' high sequence- and structural similarity. We propose a model in which Mg2+ ions exert a generic effect on hypernucleosome compactness and stability due to electrostatic DNA shielding, with additional differential effects depending on histone identity.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

Though Histoplasma is haploid, a second copy of this chromosome is present in natural isolates of multiple Histoplasma species and is gained and lost at a high rate. Cells carrying two copies of this chromosome exhibit aspects of the environmental transcriptome even under host-like conditions and have a competitive advantage in the transition to the environmental form. Conversely, these cells are considerably less virulent than euploid cells and have a competitive disadvantage in the mouse model of infection. Chromosome seven contains a previously unstudied transcription factor that, when overexpressed in euploid Histoplasma, is sufficient to promote some of the key phenotypes of aneuploidy.

One therapy in clinical trials for OI is an antibody that neutralizes sclerostin (a Wnt signaling inhibitor) that is already FDA approved for patients with osteoporosis. In addition to increasing bone mass and lowering incident fractures in patients with osteoporosis, anti-sclerostin antibody increased bone mass and skeletal strength (measured ex vivo) in several preclinical models of OI. Because in vivo fracture incidence is the primary outcome measure in human OI trials, we examined the effect of enhancing Wnt signaling in a preclinical mouse model of moderate-severe, autosomal dominant OI (the Col1a1Aga2/+ mouse). We genetically enhanced Wnt signaling using the Lrp5A214V allele, which makes the Wnt co-receptor LRP5 resistant to inhibition by sclerostin. By crossing Col1a1Aga2/+ sires with Lrp5A214V/+ dams, we generated pups with OI alone and OI with enhanced Wnt signaling. We radiographically examined these animals for fracture at 5, 9, and 13 weeks of age. We observed that enhanced Wnt signaling significantly reduced the number of fractures in this model by 30% at all 3 ages (e.g., 5.4 +/- 1.7 fractures compared to 7.8 +/- 1.8 fractures at 5-weeks-old, p < 0.001). These data indicate enhancing Wnt signaling lowers incident fractures in a pre-clinical model of OI and suggest lower fracture incidence should achieved by giving anti-sclerostin antibody to patients with OI. These data also suggest that bone mass could be used as a surrogate marker for lowering fracture risk in patients with OI.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Over the past three decades, theoretical population genetic models and empirical analyses have elaborated on how the elimination of deleterious variants reduces variation at linked neutral sites. This process is known as background selection. However, the impact of background selection has been studied almost exclusively without reference to its effect on phenotypic variation. Here, we use population genetic theory and simulation to investigate the consequences of background selection for linked variation impacting complex traits. We find the impact of background selection on a complex trait depends on the type of selection acting on the trait, the effect size distribution, and the background selection intensity. For instance, background selection impacts a much broader range of effect sizes for traits under directional selection via a liability threshold mechanism (i.e. when selection acts on individuals with phenotypes exceeding a threshold) than when fitness decays exponentially with trait value. We also find that background selection can increase the population prevalence of a liability threshold trait (e.g. a complex binary disease trait). Furthermore, while background selection can only reduce the genetic variance of a trait under directional selection (as might be expected from the classical population genetic theory for linked neutral variants) we find that background selection can increase the genetic variance of a trait under stabilizing selection. The results presented here use a synthesis of population genetic and quantitative genetic modeling, and overall, have relevance for understand the genetic architecture and evolution of complex traits, including complex diseases.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

However, genes originating from different duplication mechanisms undergo different outcomes, especially at the expression level. Previous studies have demonstrated that segmental or whole-genome duplications generate duplicates with similar and somewhat redundant expression profiles across multiple tissues, while other duplicates display increased divergence, ultimately leading to functional innovations. However, little is known about how duplicates diverge in expression across cell types in a single tissue. Here, we used high-resolution spatial transcriptomic data from five species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Phalaenopsis aphrodite, Zea mays, and Hordeum vulgare) to investigate the evolution of gene expression following gene duplications. We found that genes originating from segmental or whole-genome duplications display increased expression levels, expression breadths, spatial variability, and number of coexpression partners. Duplication mechanisms that preserve cis-regulatory landscapes typically generate paralogs with more preserved expression profiles, but such differences by duplication mode disappear over time. Expression divergence also depends on gene functions, with dosage-sensitive gene families displaying highly preserved expression profiles, while families involved in more specialized processes (e.g., flowering and phytohormone biosynthesis) display increased divergence. Paralogs originating from large-scale (including whole-genome) duplications display redundant and/or overlapping expression profiles, indicating functional redundancy and/or subfunctionalization, while small-scale duplicates diverge asymmetrically, indicating neofunctionalization. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the tempo and mode of gene expression evolution, helping understand how gene and genome duplications shape cell identities.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": ""}

L.; Pellerin, D.; Van De Vondel, L.; Danzi, M. C.; Zuchner, S.", "abstract": "Tandem repeats are a class of genetic variation characterized by repetitions of DNA motifs of diverse sequences and lengths. Pentameric motifs, in particular, do not align with the protein-coding reading frames, often confining them to the less extensively studied non-coding portion of the genome. Intronic pentanucleotide tandem repeats are associated with 11 neurological disorders. Their pathogenic genotypes are primarily characterized by large length expansion and, unlike most repeat expansion disorders, have required a deviation from the reference motif. The population-level variability of pentameric repeats remains poorly understood due to technical limitations of short-read sequencing technologies. To address this knowledge gap, we genotyped 28,446 pentanucleotide repeat loci in 1,027 long-read PacBio HiFi samples from self-identified Black and African American participants in the All of Us Research Program. We developed new algorithms for tandem repeat decomposition, characterization, and visualization to facilitate this analysis. Our findings reveal extensive genome-wide heterogeneity in repeat length and sequence composition. Alleles with DNA sequences containing segments of distinct motifs were observed in 15% of loci. Additionally, 8% of loci exhibited multimodal repeat length distributions, in which distinct sequence compositions were often associated with distinct length ranges. Repeat loci were highly enriched in proximity to transposable elements, including 68% mapping to Alu elements, a retrotransposon specific to primates. Comparative analysis of the reference sequences from 30 species, including 27 primates, suggests that most pentanucleotide repeats fully emerged in a common ancestor of humans and other ape species, or even within more closely related hominin lineages. As an example, we describe a highly polymorphic and recently evolved repeat locus in the ABCA1 gene, a major regulator of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid homeostasis.

Pooled, high-content perturbation screening methods like Perturb-seq allow us to assess the impact of each of a large number of genetic interventions on a rich cellular profile of RNA or other features, facilitating such discoveries. However, the overall scale of perturbations, especially when considering combinations of genes for perturbation, cannot be tackled exhaustively in the lab. An alternative is to use an iterative design: By leveraging the modularity and sparsity of gene cir- cuits along with prior biological knowledge, we can predict the impact of unseen genetic perturbations on these profiles and group genes with similar effects into co-functional modules, followed by a new round of Perturb-Seq to test these pre- dictions and improve the overall performance of the model. These iterative cycles of experiment and prediction allow prioritizing genes for testing, maximizing the knowledge gleaned from fixed experimental resources, and opening the way to learn general predictive models. Designing these experiments requires a system that can analyze a cellular system, incorporate new and existing knowledge, use statistical tools, predict the effects of unseen perturbations, and prioritize the set of perturbations for the next iteration. These can be time-consuming tasks for scientists and require multiple different skills. Here, we developed PerTurboAgent, an LLM-based agent that excels in predicting candidate gene panels for iterative Perturb-Seq experiments through self-directed data analysis and knowledge retrieval.

We found that while reward-related dopamine signals were broadly distributed, responses to aversive events were region-specific, enabling classification of projection targets from these dopamine dynamics. By examining the main axis of covariance of dopamine release across the brain, we found that reward prediction error signals are encoded by parallel manifolds, whereas aversive stimulus signals are encoded by orthogonal manifolds.

First, we provide neural evidence that attention was allocated simultaneously to both foveal target and parafoveal post-target words. Second, we found an early parafoveal lexical effect, whereby lower frequency targets demanded more attention prior to fixation, and, additionally, a foveal load effect whereby lower frequency targets reduced the amount of attention allocated to post-targets.
