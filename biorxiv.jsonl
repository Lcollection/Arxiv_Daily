Previous research has predominantly focused on attention in the visual periphery, leaving the role of foveal processing in naturalistic tasks largely unexplored. Here, we recorded neural activity from both foveal and peripheral RFs in areas V4 and IT of monkeys during free-gaze visual search among complex stimuli. We found robust feature-based attentional enhancements in foveal units, challenging the prevailing view that such modulation is predominantly peripheral. By integrating data from foveal and peripheral recordings, we revealed a non-uniform, dynamically distributed pattern of feature attention across the visual field. Behaviorally, foveal attentional enhancements promoted sustained or repeated fixations on targets, while peripheral attentional signals facilitated target detection and guidance of future saccades. These findings suggest that foveal and peripheral attention operate in a complementary fashion, and highlight the critical role of foveal feature attention in shaping global attention allocation and fixation behavior during active vision. This work advances our understanding of the neural computations that support complex visual search and underscores the need to account for foveal processing in models of attention.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

However, a comprehensive mapping of cortical structure in relation to empathy and psychopathy is lacking. Methods: In 804 incarcerated adult men, we administered the Perspective Taking (IRI-PT) and Empathic Concern (IRI-EC) subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Interpersonal/Affective [F1] and Lifestyle/Antisocial [F2] factors), and T1-weighted MRI to quantify cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA). We also included the male sample from the Human Connectome Project (HCP; N = 501) to probe the replicability of structural-covariance gradients. Results: PCL-R F1 was uniquely negatively related to IRI-EC, while PCL-R F2 was uniquely negatively related to IRI-PT. Cortical structure was not related to either IRI subscale, although there was effect-size differentiation by cytoarchitectonic class and/or functional network. CT was related to PCL-R F1 (mostly positively), SA was related to both PCL-R factors (only positively), and both cortical indices demonstrated out-of-sample predictive utility for PCL-R F1. The high-psychopathy group (N = 178) scored uniquely lower on IRI-EC while having increased SA (but not CT); across the cortex, effect sizes were largest in the paralimbic class and somatomotor network, and meta-analytic task-based activations corroborated affective/sensory importance. Finally, the total sample revealed anterior-posterior gradients of covariance, which were replicated in the HCP sample. In the high-psychopathy group, the gradient of CT (but not SA) was globally compressed. Conclusions: Most notably, high-psychopathy men had reduced empathic concern, increased SA, and compressed macroscale organization of CT.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

In this study, we employed two computational approaches to model and estimate the parameters governing the diffusion-controlled drug release of bovine serum albumin and bevacizumab (an agent that slows neovascularization due to retinal disorders) from bi-layered core-shell microspheres composed of chitosan and polycaprolactone (PCL).

Cell proliferation arrest usually precedes terminal differentiation, suggesting that these two processes may be coordinated. Here we took advantage of the very stereotyped development of the C. elegans intestine to address whether the control of the proliferation and differentiation programs are systematically coupled. We show that delaying cell cycle arrest does not affect most aspects of intestinal differentiation but leads to a specific delay in the accumulation of late microvilli components. Reciprocally, we find that the differentiation factors ELT-2 and ELT-7 control cell cycle arrest specifically in posterior enterocytes. The occurrence of supernumerary divisions in the absence of ELT-2 and ELT-7 is associated with changes in the expression pattern of the cell cycle regulators cyclin B1 and CKI-1 and depends on the presence of the posterior Hox protein PHP-3. Our work thus demonstrates the existence of reciprocal interactions between cell proliferation and cell differentiation. It nevertheless also shows that these two processes are only partially coupled, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms ensuring their temporal control.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Earlier work suggested that shared architectural constraints were a major factor, but the success of widely varied architectures after pre-training raises critical questions about the importance of architectural constraints. Here we show that in wide networks with minimal training, architectural inductive biases have a prominent role. We examined networks with varied architectures but no pre-training and quantified their ability to predict image representations in the visual cortices of monkeys and humans. We found that cortex-aligned representations emerge in convolutional architectures that combine two key manipulations of dimensionality: compression in the spatial domain, through pooling, and expansion in the feature domain by increasing the number of channels. We further show that the inductive biases of convolutional architectures are critical for obtaining performance gains from feature expansion--dimensionality manipulations were relatively ineffective in other architectures and in convolutional models with targeted lesions. Our findings suggest that the architectural constraints of convolutional networks are sufficiently close to the constraints of biological vision to allow many aspects of cortical visual representation to emerge even before synaptic connections have been tuned through experience.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Objective: Here, we evaluated the effects of A{beta} on fear memory and functional connectome measures in mice. Methods: Middle-aged (9-11mo) double transgenic APP-PS1 mice and age and sex-matched controls were tested on a fear conditioning protocol and then imaged at 11.1 Tesla. Brains were harvested and processed for analysis of A{beta} plaques and Iba1 immunolabeling in cortex, hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala. Additional RNA sequencing data from separate age, strain, and sex matched mice were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and weighted gene co-expression networks. Results: In both male and female mice, we observed increased functional connectivity in a dorsal striatal/amygdala network due to A{beta}. Increased functional connectivity within this network was matched by increases in A{beta}PP gene expression, A{beta} and Iba1 immunolabeling, and an upregulated cluster of DEGs involved in the immune response. Conversely, the network measure representing node hubness, eigenvector centrality, was increased in prefrontal cortical brain regions, but only in female APP-PS1 mice. This female specific-effect of amyloid was associated with downregulation of a cluster of DEGs involved in cortical and striatal GABA transmission, anxiogenic responses, and motor activity, in female APP-PS1 mice, but not males.

Identifying key regulators is critical for developing targeted therapies. Here, we demonstrate the impact of the loss of apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor (AATF) on hepatic lipid metabolism and MASH progression. Methods: A preclinical mouse model recapitulating human MASH was established by feeding C57Bl/6 mice either a chow diet (CD) or a western diet with sugar water (WD). Hepatic AATF silencing was achieved by tail vein injection of siAATF delivered by adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) with the liver-specific thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) promoter. In addition to histological, biochemical, and molecular biology evaluations, the mechanistic insights were derived from whole transcriptomics and untargeted metabolomics analyses. Results: AAV8-mediated specific knockdown of AATF in hepatocytes significantly reduced body weight, liver weight, and insulin resistance in mice fed with western diet (WD). However, no such effects were observed in mice fed with a chow diet (CD). Further analyses showed reduced liver injury, steatosis, and steatohepatitis in WDsiAATF mice. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that loss of AATF alleviated cellular stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in WD-fed mice. Moreover, AATF silencing led to alterations in lipid metabolism, notably by decreasing hepatic lipogenesis in the WD mice. Interestingly, untargeted metabolomics revealed an increase in the biosynthesis of glycerophospholipids and beta-oxidation of fatty acids in WDsiAATF mice. Conclusion: Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of AATF as a central regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism in MASH, acting through the AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway, and establish its inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for metabolic liver disease.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Pooled hypothalami from aged male Norway brown rats treated with 17-estradiol (O.T), aged male controls (O), and young male controls (Y) underwent single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (snRNA-seq). To evaluate the effects of 17-estradiol on aging neurons, supervised clustering of neurons based on neuropeptides and their receptors were used to evaluate the responses of each neuron subtype during aging and after 17-estradiol treatment. The elevated cellular metabolism, stress and decreased expression levels of pathways involved in synapse formation in neurons initiated by aging were significantly attenuated by 17-estradiol. Assessment of changes in neuron populations showed that neurons related to food intake, reproduction, blood pressure, stress response, and electrolyte balance were sensitive to 17-estradiol treatment. 17-estradiol treatment not only increased serum Oxytocin (Oxt), but also heightened the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, as evidenced by significantly elevated levels of plasma Gnrh, total testosterone, and decreased estradiol. Elevated Gnrh1 was confirmed to be one of the causal effects mediating the role of 17-estradiol in energy homeostasis, neural synapse, and stress response. Notably, Crh neurons exhibited prominent stressed phenotype in O.T, distinct to appetite-stimulating neurons Agrp and Ghrl. Therefore, the HPG axis and energy metabolism may be key targets of 17-estradiol in male hypothalamus. Additionally, supervised clustering of neurons was shown to be a useful method for assessing treatment responses and cellular perturbation among different neuron subtypes in the hypothalamus.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

However, it is difficult to evaluate such physical actions genetically, simply because they are nonspecific and can be caused by any molecule. Therefore, we investigated a method to compare this nonspecific action among cells with diverse membrane protein profiles. We found that a wide range of glycoproteins individually had a strong inhibitory effect on infection, while on the other hand, the total amount of glycans was negatively correlated with the infection level in each cell. Thus, the infection-inhibitory effect of glycoproteins was molecularly nonspecific, but was additively enhanced according to the amount of glycans on the cell surface. In this correlation, glycans function as a fundamental factor. Further investigating the mechanism by which glycans function as a factor in infection control, we conclude that the repulsion between proteins created by branched glycans forms a kinetic energy barrier against packing the virus into the region of protein interstitial space. As a result, the formation of the adhesive interface between the virus and the cell membrane, which is necessary for infection, is inhibited. This study attempted to link the cell's nonspecific physical properties with intracellular biochemicals.

This is a powerful approach since it is a multi-region measurement, but because the imaging is done post-mortem, each animal only provides one set of counts. Experiments are expensive and since cells are counted by imaging and aligning a large number of brain sections, they are time-intensive. The resulting datasets tend to be under-sampled with fewer animals than brain regions. As a consequence, these data are a challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We present a 'standard' partially-pooled Bayesian model for multi-region cell-count data and apply it to two example datasets. These examples demonstrate that hierarchical Bayesian methods are well suited to these data. In both cases the Bayesian model outperformed standard parallel t-tests.

We used local Hebbian plasticity rules and continuous random mechanical activations of a mass-spring-damper model of skin tissue, thereby mimicking the process of early brain development observed in humans and animals alike. The recurrent network, emulating a generic, primitive cortical-like subnetwork, was composed of fully connected excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with independent learning in both types of synapses. Continual random external activations of the skin, without resetting the network state, led to rapid acquisition of remarkably robust and generalizable representations of the skin inputs. The trained network could separate various dynamic skin inputs and solve a kinematics task it had never encountered, even when substantial parts of the sensor population or internal network connections were removed post-training.

However, whether and how ER-phagy is regulated during Gram-negative bacteria infection to influence host responses remains unclear. Here, we show that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium releases lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that colocalizes with FAM134B, a reticulon-like ER-resident receptor for ER-phagy. Cytosolic delivery of LPS, either during infection or via transfection, markedly increases FAM134B- and LC3B-decorated ER fragments. Mechanistically, pulldown assays demonstrate that LPS directly binds FAM134B through interactions between lipid A and positively charged residues within its amphipathic helices and C-terminal region. This interaction promotes FAM134B oligomerization and drives ER membrane fragmentation, a process further amplified by the O-antigen moiety of LPS. The resulting ER fragments accumulate around LC3-positive Salmonella-containing vacuoles, facilitating bacterial clearance. Importantly, both intracellular and extracellular Salmonella exploit outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to deliver LPS into the host cytosol, triggering FAM134B activation and ER remodeling. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized host response by which LPS of Gram-negative bacteria are sensed by the host ER-phagy machinery to promote xenophagy and enhance antibacterial defense.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

While mechanisms allowing tumors to circumvent these systemic growth restrictions have been established, the physiological processes that overcome inflammation-induced growth restrictions during regeneration remain largely unexplored. In our study, we use a model of tissue inflammation and regeneration in developing Drosophila imaginal discs to dissect key metabolic and signaling adaptations that, in physiological settings, both induce and overcome systemic growth restrictions. We find that expression of eiger, the Drosophila TNF- homolog, induces systemic insulin restriction, as evidenced by reduced expression of dILP2 and dILP5, as well as elevated nuclear dFOXO, and reduced protein translation and proliferation in peripheral tissues. Proliferating cells overcome systemic insulin restriction by upregulating Pdk1, which is both necessary and sufficient to promote phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and protein translation via an Insulin/Akt-independent mechanism. We further demonstrate that JAK/STAT signaling acts upstream to increase Pdk1 levels, delineating a novel JAK/STAT-Pdk1-S6K axis essential for regenerative proliferation. The upregulation of amino acid transporters in the proliferative domain further suggests that regenerating cells preferentially import amino acids, fueling mTORC1 activation. Similar metabolic signatures are observed in a Drosophila RasV12, scrib tumor model, suggesting that tumors may co-opt these metabolic pathways to sustain growth in an insulin-restricted environment.

One hypothesis for the benefit of transformation is that it enables \"chromosomal curing\": the deletion of integrative mobile genetic elements (MGEs). However, many such MGEs are sensitive RecA-DNA filaments, triggering activation of a lifecycle that may enable them to evade HR-mediated deletion. Despite >40% of isolates containing prophage integrated at a site that inhibits transformation, three representative prophage were identified in naturally-competent pneumococci to test this hypothesis. These encompassed representatives with C1-type and ImmAR-type regulatory systems, found in almost all pneumococcal prophage. All three prophage were deleted by HR with an efficiency similar to the transfer of base substitutions. Mutations that impaired a C1-regulated prophage increased this deletion rate, reflecting this element being activated by RecA-DNA filaments imported during transformation, likely preferentially killing cells that induce the competence machinery. ImmAR-regulated prophage instead responded to transient stimuli by excising as deletion-resistant pseudolysogens, only driving cell lysis in response to sustained stimuli. This was likely a consequence of these prophage reacting to multiple signals, as they differed in their response to both RecA and the DNA-binding protein and competence repressor DprA. One prophage constitutively elevated host DprA levels, thereby reducing transformation by preventing induction of the competence machinery. Hence these data are consistent with an evolutionary arms race between prophage and the competence machinery, resulting in bacterial diversification though HR being impeded by MGEs preventing their own elimination from the chromosome.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in neuronal recording techniques aim to progress towards this milestone, yet the resulting high-dimensional responses are challenging to interpret and link to relevant variables.

In this work, we introduce SPARKS, a biologically inspired model capable of high decoding accuracy and interpretable discovery within a single framework. SPARKS adapts the self-attention mechanism of large language models to extract information from the timing of single spikes and the sequence in which neurons fire using Hebbian learning. Trained with a criterion inspired by predictive coding to enforce temporal coherence, our model produces low-dimensional latent embeddings that are robust across sessions and animals. By directly capturing the underlying data distribution through a generative encoding-decoding framework, SPARKS exhibits state-of-the-art predictive capabilities across diverse electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets from the motor, visual and entorhinal cortices. Crucially, the Hebbian coefficients learned by the model are interpretable, allowing us to infer the effective connectivity and recover the known functional hierarchy of the mouse visual cortex. Overall, SPARKS unifies representation learning, high-performance decoding and model interpretability in a single framework by bridging neuroscience and AI, providing a powerful and versatile tool for dissecting neural computations and marking a step towards the next generation of biologically inspired intelligent systems.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

We collected eye movement data from healthy young adults as they watched commercial films (N=104), or online Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) educational courses (N=44). We analyzed changes in pupil size and eye movement speed near event boundaries and employed inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) and hidden Markov models (HMM) to identify patterns indicative of event segmentation. We observed that both the speed of eye movements and pupil size dynamically responded to event boundaries, exhibiting heightened sensitivity to high-strength boundaries. Our analyses further revealed that event boundaries synchronized eye movements across participants. These boundaries, can be effectively identified by HMM, yielded higher within-event similarity values and aligned with human-annotated boundaries. Importantly, HMM-based event segmentation metrics responded to experimental manipulations and predicted learning outcomes.

M.; Coers, J.", "abstract": "A central signal that marshals host defense against many infections is the lymphocyte-derived cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}). The IFN{gamma} receptor is expressed on most human cells, and its activation leads to the expression of antimicrobial proteins that execute diverse cell-autonomous immune programs. One such immune program consists of the sequential detection, ubiquitylation, and destruction of intracellular pathogens. Recently, the IFN{gamma}-inducible ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 was identified as a pivotal mediator of such a defense axis. RNF213 provides host protection against viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens. To establish infections, potentially susceptible intracellular pathogens must have evolved mechanisms that subdue RNF213-controlled cell-autonomous immunity. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that a causative agent of bacillary dysentery, Shigella flexneri, uses the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector IpaH1.4 to induce the degradation of RNF213. S. flexneri mutants lacking IpaH1.4 expression are bound and ubiquitylated by RNF213 in the cytosol of IFN{gamma}-primed host cells. Linear (M1-) and lysine-linked ubiquitylation of S. flexneri requires RNF213 but is independent of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). We find that ubiquitylation of S. flexneri is insufficient to kill intracellular bacteria, suggesting that S. flexneri employs additional virulence factors to escape from host defenses that operate downstream from RNF213-driven ubiquitylation. In brief, this study identified the bacterial IpaH1.4 protein as an inhibitor of mammalian RNF213 and highlights evasion of RNF213-driven immunity as a characteristic of the human-tropic pathogen Shigella.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

However, evidence on how these attentional templates is represented during preparation remains controversial. Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an orientation cueing task to isolate preparatory activity from stimulus-evoked responses. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found decodable information of the to-be-attended orientation during preparation; yet preparatory activity patterns were different from those evoked when actual orientations were perceived. When perturbing the neural activity by means of a visual impulse ('pinging' technique), the preparatory activity patterns in visual cortex resembled those associated with perceiving these orientations. The observed differential patterns with and without the impulse perturbation suggest a predominantly non-sensory format and a latent, sensory-like format of representation during preparation. Furthermore, the emergence of the sensory-like template coincided with enhanced information connectivity between V1 and frontoparietal areas and was associated with improved behavioral performance. By engaging this dual-format mechanism during preparation, the brain is able to encode both abstract, non-sensory information and more detailed, sensory information, potentially providing advantages for adaptive attentional control. For example, consistent with recent theories of visual search, a predominantly non-sensory template can support the initial guidance and a latent sensory-like format can support prospective stimulus processing.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Current theories propose that the long-term maintenance of synaptic efficacies and memory is accomplished via a positive-feedback loop at the level of production of a protein species or a protein state. Here we propose a qualitatively different theoretical framework based on negative feedback at the level of protein elimination. This theory is motivated by recent experimental findings regarding the binding of PKM[&zeta] ~ and KIBRA, two synaptic proteins involved in maintenance of memory, and on how this binding downregulates the proteins' degradation. We demonstrate this theoretical framework with two different models. First, a simple abstract model to explore generic features of the negative-feedback process. Second, a biophysical model based on PKM[&zeta]-KIBRA dimers that cooperatively form larger complexes at active synapses. These larger complexes have slower degradation and diffusion, allowing for bistability of potentiated and unpotentiated synaptic states. The results of these models are qualitatively consistent with existing experiments showing reversal of long-term potentiation and erasure of long-term memory by inhibition of KIBRA-PKM[&zeta] interactions.

However, capturing this replay in humans has been challenging because unlike wakefulness, sleep EEG is dominated by slow, rhythmic background activity. Moreover, each sleep stage (e.g., NREM, REM) has distinct rhythms, hindering generalisation of models trained on wake-state data. To overcome these challenges, we developed the Sleep Interpreter (SI), a neural network model that decodes memory replay from sleep EEG. In a large dataset comprising 135 participants (~1,000 h of overnight sleep; ~400 h of wake), we employed a TMR-like paradigm with 15 semantically congruent cue-image pairs to tag specific memories. SI was trained separately for NREM and REM using contrastive learning to align neural patterns across wake and sleep, filtering out stage-specific background rhythms. We also examined how slow oscillations and spindle coupling influence decoding in NREM sleep. In a 15-way classification, SI achieved up to 40.02% Top-1 accuracy on unseen subjects. To test generalisability, we followed up with two independent nap experiments in separate samples and applied the trained SI model off-the-shelf. The first probed spontaneous reactivation without auditory cues, while the second used semantic-free sounds with new images. In both, SI successfully decoded reactivation during sleep that correlated with post-nap memory performance. By openly sharing our dataset and SI system, we provide a unique resource for advancing research on memory and learning during sleep, and related disorders.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Microglia-like cells of either genotype did not induce neurodegeneration of healthy dopamine neurons in co-culture experiments. However, LRRK2-mutant microglia became hyperreactive upon LPS stimulation when compared with controls, as judged by cytokine expression profile, production of reactive oxygen species. We then tested a-synuclein and neuromelanin as potential endogenous stimuli for activating mutant microglia. Upon exposure to neuromelanin-containing particles, but not to preformed a-synuclein fibrils, LRRK2-mutant microglia induced the degeneration of healthy dopamine neurons, in a process that could be prevented by pre-treatment with the immunomodulatory drug ivermectin. Finally, the analysis of post-mortem midbrain tissue of LRRK2-PD patients found increased numbers of activated microglia cells in close contact with neuromelanin-containing neurons.

Here, we present the ensemble of ECM proteins and associated factors for the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis based on in silico prediction and quantitative proteomic analysis of decellularized mesoglea from different life stages. The integration of the matrisome with single cell transcriptome atlases shows that gastrodermal cells are the primary producers of Nematostella's complex ECM, confirming the homology of the cnidarian inner cell layer with bilaterian mesoderm. The transition from larva to polyp is marked by an upregulation of metalloproteases and basement membrane components including all members of an unusually diversified SVEP1/Polydom family, suggesting massive epithelial remodeling. The enrichment of Wnt/PCP pathway factors during this process further indicates directed cell rearrangements as a key contributor to the polyp's morphogenesis.

This understanding is more comprehensive when we perform an integrative analysis of multiple measurements (or modalities) across various developmental stages.

We introduce scMultiNODE, an unsupervised integration model that combines gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements in developing single cells, while preserving cell type variations and cellular dynamics. First, scMultiNODE uses a scalable, Quantized Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align a large number of cells across different measurements. Next, it utilizes neural ordinary differential equations to explicitly model cell development with a regularization term to learn a dynamic latent space. Experiments on six real-world developmental single-cell datasets demonstrate that scMultiNODE can integrate temporally profiled multi-modal single-cell measurements more effectively than existing methods that focus on cell type variations and often overlook cellular dynamics. We also demonstrate that scMultiNODE's joint latent space facilitates several insightful downstream analyses of single-cell development, including the investigation of complex cell trajectories and the enabling of cross-modal label transfer.

This study performed urinary proteomics analysis on individuals with a family history of FTD but without known mutations and healthy controls to investigate whether there are differential urinary proteins and biological pathways in FTD family members who remain undiagnosed with FTD or common mutations under existing diagnostic methods.

No evidence is found for protonophoric or ionophoric uncoupling. Rather, by directly inhibiting ATP synthase, bedaquiline slows the respiratory supercomplex (Qcr:Cta; bcc:aa3) by increasing the proton-motive force, causing sub-second redirection of electron flux through the cytochrome bd oxidase (Cyd) to O2. Electron flux redirection explains the idiosyncratic bedaquiline-induced increase in O2 consumption rates previously observed. Redirection occurs as Cyd is present even in cells grown in plentiful O2. Applying the same approach to human cells did not detect bedaquiline-induced inhibition of mitochondrial function despite such inhibition being seen in isolated systems.

In the first experiment, participants stood and stabilized their arm against a colliding virtual object. This occurred while subjects either visually pursued the moving object or fixated a central location. The robot occasionally applied a mechanical perturbation to the arm either 200ms or 60ms before the anticipated collision. As in previous studies, LLRs were observed in leg muscles to a perturbation of the upper limb. Moreover, leg LLRs were modulated by gaze, being larger during pursuit than fixation but only during the late perturbations. This timing-specific modulation aligns with previous reports of policy transitions in feedback control roughly 60ms before impact. Upper limb LLRs were not significantly impacted by gaze. This lack of modulation could reflect the context of upright stance, so we conducted a second experiment which was the same in all ways except that the subjects remained seated.

However, if such a symbiosis were introduced, it would have to be economically viable in the context of existing nutrient acquisition strategies, including the existing symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that the vast majority of plants already engage in. This raises the question of how the metabolic costs and benefits from these separate symbioses that have partially overlapping functions might impact nutrient status and subsequent plant growth. To address this, we developed metabolic models describing how the relative growth rate of Zea mays is impacted by the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis and a hypothetical N2-fixing symbiosis with Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens both in isolation and in tandem. To validate the AMF component of our model, we conducted field evaluation of mutant AMF-incompatible maize hybrids and found that the empirically measured AMF-mediated growth benefit agreed well with our model's predictions. Our model of the rhizobium symbiosis predicted that the lower N content of cereal crops makes the relative growth rate cost associated with acquiring nitrogen from N2-fixing rhizobia smaller than in legumes. Finally, our model also predicted positive synergies between rhizobia and AMF under nutrient-limited conditions but negative synergies under nutrient, particularly phosphorus, replete conditions. These findings indicate that these bioengineering strategies could improve cereal crop yields and may achieve greater gains in tandem, but soil nutrient status of target sites as well as the nitrogen requirements of specific varieties should be considered.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

We studied CBP in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), a species in which conspecific brood parasitism has been reported. We conducted parentage analysis on 1945 barn swallow broods involving 7816 offspring. Samples were collected over 12 breeding seasons at 5 colonies/populations. Contrary to expectations, we identified only six cases of CBP (0.3 % of broods). By identifying all individuals involved, i.e. the parasitic females, the female hosts and the males that fathered the parasitic eggs, we determined these cases of CBP resulted most likely from either a failed nest take-over (three times), the disappearance of a female partner or a disruption caused by researchers while only one case could be interpreted as a result of females mixed reproductive tactic. Based on a review of the literature on CBP in seven other Hirundinidae, we conclude that the only reliable evidence for CBP comes from cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonata). Studies on other species either failed to identify the parasitic females or do not present sufficient evidence supporting the occurrence of CBP. Several studies relied on the appearance of two eggs in a nest within 24 hours to conclude that CBP occurred. However, based on the parentage analysis, we show that CBP only occurred in one out of 11 such cases in our barn swallow data. Our findings highlight that CBP is rare in our barn swallow populations, and have been likely overestimated in other studies. We emphasize the importance of frequent nest checks and rigorous genetic validation in CBP research.

Excessive liver fibrosis is caused by persistent activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which is defined by myofibroblast activation (MFA) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Strategies to prevent or reverse this HSC phenotype will be critical for successful treatment of liver fibrosis. We have previously shown that full-term, cell-free human amniotic fluid (cfAF) inhibits MFA and EMT in fibroblasts in vitro. We hypothesize that cfAF treatment can attenuate HSC activation and limit liver fibrosis. We tested if cfAF could prevent liver fibrosis or HSC activation in murine models of liver damage, three-dimensional hepatic spheroids, and HSC cultures. Administering cfAF prevented weight loss and the extent of fibrosis in mice with chronic liver damage without stimulating deleterious immune responses. Gene expression profiling and immunostaining indicated that cfAF administration in carbon tetrachloride-treated mice reduced EMT- and MFA-related biomarker abundance and modulated transcript levels associated with liver metabolism, immune regulatory pathways, and cell signaling. cfAF treatment lowered MFA biomarker levels in a dose-dependent manner in hepatic spheroids exposed to ethanol. Treating HSCs with cfAF in vitro strongly repressed EMT. Multi-omics analyses revealed that it also attenuates TGF{beta}-induced MFA and inflammation-associated processes. Thus, cfAF treatment prevents liver fibrosis by safeguarding against persistent HSC activation. These findings suggest that cfAF may be a safe and effective therapy for reducing liver fibrosis and preventing the development of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

DELi features a simple configuration setup to provide an accessible and straightforward user interface. To showcase its capabilities, we used DELi to design an in-house custom, benzimidazole-based DEL (UNC DEL006), and performed proof-of-concept selection experiments against Bromodomain-containing Protein 4 (BRD4). The DELi decoding and analysis modules identified top-performing compounds, leading to the off-DNA synthesis of UNC11951, which was confirmed as a nanomolar BRD4 binder via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). These results demonstrate DELi as an effective tool for DEL design and analysis. Furthermore, its open-source nature will promote ongoing development and contributions from the DEL community to expand its applications and capabilities, making DEL technology more widely accessible.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Here we quantify the causal response of adult skill level to point influences earlier in development in a mechanistic in-silico replica of major aspects of human development and evolution. We find that adult skill level is more reactive to changes in developmental history than to genetic, environmental, or social changes in the genus Homo. We also find that adverse genetic and environmental conditions that would developmentally yield low adult skill level in humans can be compensated by time-specific environmental changes or by slight changes in developmental history, potentially yielding outstanding adult skill level. Our analyses identify a major capability of developmental history to influence adult human skill level.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

In Drosophila, the amnioserosa, a highly dynamic extra-embryonic tissue, undergoes extensive remodeling, culminating in its complete elimination at the end of dorsal closure. While apoptotic cell delaminations in the amnioserosa have been proposed to contribute to dorsal closure, the cellular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated actomyosin dynamics during cell delaminations and analyzed the consequences of perturbing non-muscle Myosin activity globally in the entire tissue as well as locally in groups of cells. We found that Myosin plays an essential role in both triggering and executing cell delaminations, with high Myosin contractility promoting cell delamination via caspase activation. Additionally, our results suggest that cell delaminations are governed by both cell-autonomous Myosin dynamics and mechanical cues from the tissue environment. Together, these findings provide new insights into the regulation of epithelial cell removal and the complex interplay between apoptotic and mechanical signals during tissue remodeling.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

S.; Mukherjee, S.; Varshney, U.; Chakravortty, D.", "abstract": "The intestinal milieu is largely characterized by the complex array of chemical compounds produced through the metabolic activity of resident microbiota. Enteric pathogens like Salmonella, which have evolved refined mechanisms to persist within this environment, utilize these microbial metabolites and self-produce quorum molecules as molecular cues to identify ecological niches and modulate their survival and virulence strategies. Salmonella quorum sensing involves producing and detecting Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signaling molecules. Our research reveals that Salmonella Typhimurium enhances AI-2 biosynthesis and transport under acidic conditions, aiding environmental adaptation and facilitating pathogenesis in macrophages. AI-2 signaling regulates the pH-sensing two-component system genes, phoP/phoQ, ensuring cytosolic pH homeostasis, survival, and acid tolerance. It also involves regulating the lysine/cadaverine-mediated acid tolerance response and maintaining bacterial cytosolic pH. Furthermore, we show that the repressor LsrR protein, apart from the lsr promoter, binds to only one strand of the phoP promoter via its Y25 and R43 amino acids to negatively modulate phoP expression. Additionally, this signaling ameliorates the intracellular survival by modulating Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-2 (SPI-2) regulators (ssrA/ssrB) and SPI-2 effector expression via PhoP. Mouse models demonstrate that AI-2 signaling is essential for colonizing the primary and secondary infection sites, showcasing its critical role in pathogenesis and low pH survival mechanisms in Salmonella.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Their antlers, one of their most recognizable features, are used for dominance displays, mate attraction, and defense, with size and morphology being key determinants of success. Antler characteristics are influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including habitat quality and resource availability. In this study, we explored how diverse environmental factors, including climate and land cover composition, impact antler size, morphology, and the distribution of record-scoring white-tailed deer across Ontario, Canada, using hunter-submitted data from long-term antler scoring records. We used conditional autoregressive (CAR) models to examine these relationships and found that warmer temperatures the year of harvest were positively associated with larger antlers and more record deer in a given county, while winter precipitation the year of harvest was negatively associated with these characteristics, likely due to reduced forage availability or increased energy expenditure during more severe winters. Rangeland and forest land cover types were positively associated with increased antler size and tine number. We observed no temporal changes in antler size in Ontario, contrasting with broader trends observed in North America. These results show how local environmental conditions and land cover composition influence antler traits and the distribution of record white-tailed deer, highlighting the complexity of environmental influences on trait variation.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Early age-related neuropathological changes are the breeding ground for the development of these disorders. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. They play crucial roles in maintaining brain homeostasis, yet their age-related changes remain not fully understood. While age-related microglia changes have been strongly characterized in rodents, studies in non-human primates are scarce. The microcebe primate (mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus)) is widely used as a model for cerebral aging and to investigate age-related neurodegenerative processes. HLA-DR is a major histocompatibility class II cell surface receptor which presents antigens to cells of the immune response. It is a major marker of microglia reaction. In this study, we explored microglia in the whole brains of middle-aged and old microcebes using HLA-DR immunolabeling. We analyzed microglial morphology and quantified HLA-DR+ cell density and protein expression. A wide range of microglial morphologies was observed in the white matter, including thin processes microglia, rod-like elongated and polarized shape, hypertrophic, and amoeboid microglia. Aging was associated with increased HLA-DR+ microglial expression in the white matter while very few HLA-DR+ microglia were observed in the parenchyma of cortical gray matter regions. A second finding was the higher number of HLA-DR+ perivascular macrophages in old animals. This study in a primate outlines that, in the absence of neurodegenerative processes, the most prominent signs of age-related microglia/macrophage changes are region-specific and concern white matter and perivascular regions. This emphasizes the need to target these regions to prevent cerebral aging.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Identifying genes involved in specialized metabolism remains difficult. While coexpression analysis is a widely used approach to identify genes acting in the same pathway or process, it has limitations, particularly in distinguishing genes coexpressed due to shared regulatory triggers from those directly involved in the same pathway. To enhance functional predictions, integrating phylogenetic analysis provides an additional layer of confidence by considering evolutionary conservation. Here, we introduce CoExpPhylo, a computational pipeline that systematically combines coexpression analysis and phylogenetics to identify candidate genes involved in specialized biosynthetic pathways across multiple species based on one to multiple bait gene candidates. Results: CoExpPhylo systematically integrates coexpression information and phylogenetic signals to identify candidate genes involved in specialized biosynthetic pathways. The pipeline consists of multiple computational steps: (1) species-specific coexpression analysis, (2) local sequence alignment to identify orthologs, (3) clustering of candidate genes into Orthologous Coexpressed Groups (OCGs), (4) functional annotation, (5) global sequence alignment, (6) phylogenetic tree generation, and optionally (7) visualization. The workflow is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust correlation thresholds, filtering parameters, and annotation sources. Benchmarking CoExpPhylo on multiple pathways, including the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and flavonols, as well as lutein and zeaxanthin, confirmed its ability to recover known genes while also suggesting novel candidates. Conclusion: CoExpPhylo provides a systematic framework for identifying candidate genes involved in the specialized metabolism. By integrating coexpression data with phylogenetic clustering, it facilitates the discovery of both conserved and lineage-specific genes. The resulting OCGs offer a strong foundation for further experimental validation, bridging the gap between computational predictions and functional characterization. Future improvements, such as incorporating multi-species reference databases and refining clustering for large gene families, could further enhance its resolution. Overall, CoExpPhylo represents a valuable tool for accelerating pathway elucidation and advancing our understanding of specialized metabolism in plants.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

These metals can be transported into cells by an evolutionary-conserved family of metal transporters; however, how the ubiquitous mammalian parasite Toxoplasma gondii acquires essential metals has been unknown. Here, we have identified and characterised the first iron and zinc importer in T. gondii. This transporter, named ZFT, localised to the parasite plasma membrane and is essential for the parasites life cycle. We find ZFT is regulated by iron availability and overexpression sensitises cells to excess iron and zinc. Using a conditional knockdown system, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to reduction in mitochondrial respiration and a switch to a more quiescent lifecycle stage. To confirm transport activity, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to a reduction is parasite-associated zinc and iron, and ZFT expression complements loss of zinc transporter activity in a yeast model. Overall, we have identified the first metal uptake transporter in T. gondii and demonstrated the importance of iron and zinc to the parasite.

We investigate the potential for predation to shape AM evolution across different combinations of three species comprising a multi-trophic food web. Together in a three-species community, the fruiting bacterium Myxococcus xanthus is a mesopredator, while the bacterivorous nematode Pristionchus pacificus is apex predator and the bacterium Escherichia coli is a shared basal prey for both predators. The number and morphology of M. xanthus fruiting bodies is found to respond evolutionarily to nematodes, regardless of whether E. coli is present. E. coli alone with M. xanthus tends to reduce both fruiting body formation and spore production, but adding nematodes eliminates those negative effects. M. xanthus lineages with an ancestral antibiotic-resistance mutation evolved less overall, revealing strong historical contingency and suggesting potential tradeoffs between antibiotic-resistance and responsiveness to biotic selection. Our results suggest that predation both of and by mesopredators has played important roles in the evolution of aggregative multicellularity and reveal complex inter-trophic evolutionary interactions in a relatively simple three-species food web.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Here we show that IAV infection at temperatures that simulate fever leads to increased antiviral signaling in H1N1 and H3N2 infections. Mathematical modeling and experimental analyses reveal that differential IAV nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase production increase mvRNA and interferon production. Moreover, at the higher infection temperature, mvRNAs with dysregulating t-loops contribute most to the innate immune activation. We propose that fever during IAV infection can establish a positive feedback loop in which elevated aberrant RNA synthesis and innate immune activation can contribute to the dysregulation of cytokine production.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

The release of AlphaFold3 (AF3) during CASP16, and its effective integration by many groups, demonstrated its superiority over AlphaFold2 (AF2), particularly in confidence estimation and model selection. Additional improvements in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and fragment-based prediction, i.e., selecting the optimal fragment of the full sequence for modeling, also contributed to enhanced prediction accuracy. The top three groups--all from the Yang lab--consistently outperformed others across CASP16 monomer targets, reflecting their robust modeling pipelines and successful adoption of AF3.

While we evaluated group performance in these additional challenges, the insights gained were limited due to low participation and caveats in the design of experiments. We suggest improvements for the organization of these challenges and encourage broader engagement from the prediction community. The progress in monomer modeling from CASP15 to CASP16 was subtle, but more groups in CASP16 were able to outperform ColabFold, reflecting the communitys improved ability in optimizing AF2 and the growing adoption of AF3.

The primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) receives contralateral sensory input due to a complete crossover of axonal projections ascending from the brainstem to the thalamus, resulting in a somatotopic map that exclusively represents the contralateral side of the face. This axonal crossover is disrupted in mice with a conditional knockout of the Robo3 gene, leading to abnormal bilateral representations of the whiskers in wS1. We explored the brain's ability to adapt to a profound alteration of its somatotopic maps by using these Robo3 mutant mice. Performance on a discrimination task, in which mice reported whether a left-side or a right-side whisker was deflected, was on par with that of wild-type littermates. Unilateral optogenetic inhibition of wS1 showed that activity in the wS1 contralateral to a stimulated whisker was required for mice to report its side correctly, despite the representation of that whisker in the uninhibited hemisphere. Single-unit recordings in wS1 and the whisker primary motor cortex (wM1), a major downstream target of wS1, showed abnormal bilateral whisker responses in wS1 but largely normal responses in wM1, suggesting that the bilateral responses in wS1 were filtered out along the sensorimotor processing stream.

To search for host factors or processes essential for PM pathogenesis, a tailored genetic screen was conducted with the immuno-compromised eds1-2/pad4-1/sid2-2 (eps) triple Arabidopsis mutant. This led to the identification of five allelic disruptive mutations in Mildew Locus O 2 (MLO2) to be responsible for the compromised-immunity-yet-poor infection (cipi) mutant phenotype upon challenge from an adapted PM isolate. Moreover, the eds1/pad4/sid2/mlo2/mlo6/mlo12 (eps3m) sextuple mutant display near complete immunity to the adapted PM fungus without sign of defense activation, demonstrating that these three clade V MLOs in Arabidopsis are bona fide host susceptibility factors of PM fungi. Confocal imaging revealed focal accumulation of MLO2-GFP in the peri-penetration peg membranous space, implicating MLO2 in repairing and stabilizing the damaged host plasma membrane, which may be co-opted by PM fungi for haustorium differentiation. Results from domain-swapping analysis between MLO1 and MLO2 suggest a bipartite functional configuration for MLO2: its C-terminus determines where and when MLO2 functions, while its N-terminal seven transmembrane domain region executes the cellular function that is critical for PM pathogenesis. Genetic studies further demonstrate that, unlike MLO7 in synergids, focal accumulation of MLO2 does not depend on FERONIA (FER) and its five other family members, nor does it require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate produced from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase 1 (PIP5K1) and PIP5K2. Together, these findings define clade V MLOs as host factors co-opted by obligate biotrophic PM fungi for successful host colonization.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Understanding how some lineages evolved into major pathogens remains a central challenge and may be advanced by comparisons with their nonpathogenic counterparts. Integrative approaches have become essential for delimiting species and reconstructing evolutionary relationships, particularly in lineages with cryptic diversity or extensive chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we formally characterize six Cryptococcus species representing distinct evolutionary lineages, comprising both newly discovered and previously recognized but unnamed taxa, through a combination of phylogenomic analyses, divergence metrics, chromosomal comparisons, mating assays, and phenotypic profiling. Among pathogenic taxa, we formally name Cryptococcus hyracis sp. nov., corresponding to the previously characterized VGV lineage within the C. gattii complex. In parallel, we describe five saprobic, nonpathogenic species isolated from fruit, soil, and bark beetle galleries, spanning four phylogenetic clades. We identify a strong ecological association with bark beetles for Cryptococcus porticicola sp. nov., the only newly described nonpathogenic species with multiple sequenced strains from diverse sites. In this species, we detect strain-level chromosomal variation and evidence of sexual reproduction, along with population-level signatures of recombination consistent with ongoing genetic exchange. Across the genus, chromosome-level comparisons reveal extensive structural variation, including species- and strain-specific rearrangements that may restrict gene flow. We also identify multiple instances of chromosome number reduction, often associated with centromere inactivation following interchromosomal rearrangements. Comparative metabolic profiling with Biolog phenotype microarrays reveals clade-level differentiation and distinct substrate preferences, which may reflect metabolic divergence and habitat-specific diversification. Notably, we confirm that thermotolerance is restricted to clinically relevant taxa. These findings refine the species-level taxonomy of Cryptococcus, broaden its known genomic and ecological diversity, and strengthen the framework for investigating speciation, adaptation, and the emergence of pathogenicity within the genus.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Using a high-density proprioceptive localization task, we measured somatosensory representations of both the biological and artificial fingers at four time points: before, during (pre- and post-use), and after wear. We found three distinct phases of plasticity: wearing the device led to a contraction in perceived finger length; active use caused both biological and artificial finger representations to expand; and a lasting change in biological finger representation remained after device removal. These results show that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into somatosensory body maps, with dynamic adjustments shaped by both the structure and use of the device.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

A key difficulty lies in reconstructing the codon landscape of the target expression system within a foreign host with a native-like codon preference. To address this, we present TransCodon, a Transformer-based deep learning model that leverages both 5` untranslated regions (5`UTRs) and coding sequences (CDS), along with explicit species identifiers and RNA secondary structure information, to learn nuanced codon usage patterns across diverse organisms. By incorporating multisource genomic data and modeling sequence dependencies in a masked language modeling paradigm, TransCodon effectively captures both local and global determinants of codon preference. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating species-level information during training significantly improves the model`s ability to predict optimal synonymous codons when considering different evaluation metrics. More importantly it identifies native-like codons with less divergence from natural sequences compared to other methods. Besides, TransCodon could capture more low-frequency codons which are often omitted by other deep learning-based methods. The results thus indicate that TransCodon as a robust codon language model has the potential for generating native-like CDS with high translational efficiency in target hosts.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

This observation was independently validated using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Probabilistic modeling revealed that the elevated quantity and unique spectrum of mutations induced by POLE exonuclease deficiency increase the likelihood of inactivating essential genes on chromosome arms harboring losses, leading to a synthetic lethal phenotype in highly aneuploid cells.

Using a virtual reality-based reaching task, we investigated how vibration-biased proprioceptive feedback influences voluntary movement control. Our results suggest that muscle vibration biases perceived movement velocity, with downstream effects on perceived limb position and reflexive corrections of movement speed. We found that (i) antagonist vibration during active movement caused participants to both overestimate their movement speed while also slowing down, (ii) movement speed and endpoint errors were correlated, with muscle vibration affecting both, and (iii) adjustments in movement speed to muscle vibration are sufficiently fast to be reflexive.

Mouse studies have established a causal role of CH in atherosclerosis progression and have defined macrophage inflammatory responses as a key underlying mechanism. We undertook the present study to assess the hypothesis that ongoing inflammation would impede atherosclerosis regression in Jak2V617F(Jak2VF) CH mice.\n\nMethods and ResultsChimeric Jak2VF/WT or control WT/WT bone marrow was transplanted into Ldlr-/- mice and, following 13-16 weeks of Western diet-induced atherosclerosis progression, cholesterol was lowered either moderately (to 200-300 mg/dl) or markedly (to 100 mg/dl). With moderate cholesterol lowering there was impaired regression in Jak2VF CH mice compared to controls. However, with marked cholesterol lowering, regression was similar in Jak2VF CH and control mice.\n\nTwo mechanisms of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering-induced suppression of inflammation in plaques were implicated: 1) reversal of increased proliferation, DNA damage and Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome activation specifically in Jak2VF macrophages and 2) markedly increased macrophage triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), c-myc expressing macrophages in both Jak2VF and control mice.\n\nConclusionsAggressive LDL lowering reverses inflammasome activation and induces pro-resolving changes in macrophages in Jak2VFCH, halting atherosclerosis progression and promoting features of plaque stabilization.

However, organized into highly repetitive -satellite higher-order repeats (HORs), human centromere sequences have long resisted detailed genomic analysis. Although the development of long-read sequencing platforms has enabled the analysis of complete centromere sequences, their application to a large set of samples is still largely limited, preventing our understanding of centromere variation and haplotype structures across large human populations and the structural basis of centromere-involving translocations in cancer. Here we show that rare k-mers present in centromeric regions can serve as effective markers for dissecting the complexity of centromere structure, particularly that of active -satellite HOR arrays (aHOR arrays), across human populations and for understanding centromere-involving abnormalities in cancer. Based on rare k-mer-based clustering, centromere aHOR arrays are clustered into discrete haplogroups (aHOR-HGs) with distinct structural features. These k-mers were also used to develop a framework that enables the inference of haplogroups in a given sample based on short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data (ascairn). By applying ascairn to large-scale human population datasets (n > 3,300), we revealed the diversity of aHOR-HGs and their geographic histories across populations. The rare k-mer-based approach was also applied to investigate the structure of 1p/19q co-deletion, a highly recurrent centromere-involving translocation in IDH-mutated oligodendrogliomas. Analyzing short-read WGS data from 142 cases with 1p/19q co-deletion using rare k-mers, we showed that breakpoints of 1p/19q co-deletion were mapped to aHOR arrays in chromosomes 1 (D1Z7) and 19 (D19Z3), which was validated by long-read sequencing of two 1p/19q co-deletion-positive cases. Notably, the translocation preferentially involved haplogroups composed of haplotypes containing larger regions susceptible to rearrangement.

While various strategies have been explored to enhance the mobility of drug molecules and nanomedicines (drugs encapsulated in nanoparticles) in the vitreous, no method has demonstrated guided transport of drugs and particles through the vitreous. In this study we explore photothermal transport of nanoparticles in the vitreous, using a pulsed-laser and indocyanine green added to the vitreous, both being clinically approved modalities. We found that photothermal transport allows to guide nanoparticles from one place in the vitreous towards the laser illuminated area in the vitreous, at a distance of the injection spot of the nanoparticles. Using multiple-particle tracking and numerical simulations, we found that both thermal convection and thermophoresis contribute to photothermal transport of nanoparticles in the vitreous. We identified parameters for optimizing this effect, including dye concentration, particle size, distance from the laser focus, and laser fluence.

Semaglutide-induced weight loss and post-treatment weight regain were similar at RT and TN.

Initial weight loss was marked by reduced food intake, smaller and less frequent meals, and increased lipid oxidation. Food intake gradually returned to pre-treatment levels through increased meal frequency, while meal size remained suppressed.

Mice rapidly regained weight after treatment cessation, and this was associated with increased food intake, meal size and frequency, carbohydrate oxidation, EE, and activity.

A substantial body of research has shown that numerical magnitudes are mentally represented along a spatial continuum, akin to a ''mental number line''. Some suggested that its directionality is determined by culture and context. Nevertheless, evidence from preverbal infants and non-human animals indicates a consistent left-to-right directional mapping of numerosities, suggesting a biologically predisposed Spatial-Numerical Association (SNA) that may precede cultural factors. A recent study has shown that an implicit association between ''left'' and ''small''emerges not only in literate adults, but also in unschooled indigenous populations and preschool Western children. This finding suggests that SNAs may originate from universal innate mechanisms rather than being solely a by-product of cultural learning. However, while the study reported a strong association between ''left'' and ''decreasing'' numerosity, there was only a very weak association between ''right'' and ''increasing'' numerosity. This asymmetry was not predicted and needs further investigations to be understood. Here we further investigated the number/space association in implicit tasks in educated Western adults by using more variable and better controlled stimuli compared to the ones used in the previous study, and also manipulating stimulus format, using both dot patterns and symbolic numbers. Fifty-one adult participants performed a numerical comparison task within a Go-No-Go paradigm on subsequent pairs of visual stimuli (with ratios spanning from 0.75 to 0.94) that could appear on the left or on the right of a fixation point and completed two different tasks: ''press when more'' and ''press when less''. Results revealed distinct response patterns depending on the symbolic/non-symbolic nature of the stimuli. When non-symbolic stimuli were used, a consistent association between small numerosities and the left side and large numerosities and the right side was observed. When symbolic stimuli were used, only an association between large numerosities and the right side was observed. These findings support the hypothesis that SNAs may reflect a biological predisposition associated with brain asymmetry, and that task demands may interact with the underlying hemispheric specializations", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Although similar processes are suggested to be at work in the formation of spinal motor circuits, the molecular mechanisms involved remain mostly elusive. Here, we provide evidence that the Onecut transcription factors regulate a non-cell autonomous mechanism that modulate pre-motor interneuron development.

However, how hippocampal outputs are routed to specific cortical targets and dynamically regulated across brain states remains incompletely understood. Here, we performed simultaneous multisite recordings from the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and frontal and parietal cortex in rats alternating between wakefulness and sleep. Frontal slow oscillations operated as a global clock, resetting thalamic circuits and initiating spindle volleys that propagated from anterior to posterior cortex, while parietal slow oscillations more effectively recruited hippocampal ripples. Hippocampal ripples reflected anatomical connectivity, as dorsal ripples preferentially enhanced parietal spindles, whereas ventral ripples engaged mainly frontal spindling. Notably, when ripples synchronized in dorsal and ventral hippocampus, local excitatory drive sharply decreased and neuronal spiking redistributed, associated cortical slow oscillations and spindle responses diminished, and cortical neuronal reactivation was suppressed, indicating that dorso-ventral ripple synchrony gates, rather than amplifies, hippocampo-cortical communication. This gating effect was most evident through interactions with brain state, as dorsal-driven reactivation persisted across vigilance states, while ventral pathways were more pronounced during sleep. Collectively, our results outline a multilayer architecture in which slow oscillations provide a global temporal scaffold, spindles implement anatomically specific reactivation channels, and ripple coordination gates hippocampo-cortical communication, likely shaping the precision and specificity of memory consolidation within a highly variable neural substrate.\n\nSignificanceSharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus are critical for memory consolidation, in part due to their precise temporal coordination with cortico-thalamic sleep rhythms. However, whether ripple synchronization along the hippocampal septo-temporal axis modulates cortical memory processing has remained unresolved. Here, we show that coordinated ripples, occurring simultaneously in dorsal and ventral CA1, are observed more frequently than predicted by independent occurrence and are associated with significant suppression of cortical reactivation compared to isolated episodes. This suppression does not reflect simple changes in ripple structure or increased inhibition, but instead is linked to a redistribution of excitatory drive across the hippocampal septo-temporal axis. Importantly, this gating effect is present across both sleep and wakefulness. These findings suggest that hippocampal synchrony dynamically gates, rather than amplifies, cortical engagement, thus refining systems consolidation models by highlighting the significance of network organization and precise temporal dynamics in shaping memory replay.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

We uncover a systematic relationship between long-range temporal correlations, quantified via the Hurst exponent, and glucose metabolism. Our findings reveal that persistent temporal dependencies impose a measurable metabolic cost, with brains exhibiting higher long-range temporal correlations incurring greater energetic demands.

The classic model of cortico-basal ganglia interactions posits that within each loop, the direct pathway of the basal ganglia activates the cortex and the indirect pathway inhibits it. While this model has found support in the motor domain, whether opponent control by the two pathways extends to the cognitive domain remains unknown. Here, we record from anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) while inhibiting direct or indirect pathway neurons in DMS, as mice perform an accumulation-of-evidence task. Inconsistent with the classic model, the manipulations do not produce opponent changes in overall ACC activity. Instead, the pathways exert opponent influence over a subpopulation of ACC neurons that encode accumulated sensory evidence, the task-relevant decision variable. The direction of the modulation depends on a neurons tuning to ipsilateral versus contralateral evidence, such that the two pathways generate opponent shifts in coding specifically along the decision axis. Thus, our results uncover unexpected specificity in the effects of basal ganglia pathways on the cortex, with the two pathways of the DMS exerting opponent control not on overall activity but on coding of the relevant task variable. This functional specificity may extend to other basal ganglia loops to support different aspects of adaptive behavior, with the pathways serving a general role in selecting and shifting cortical representations to subserve circuit-specific functions.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Although self-touch attenuation is a well-documented effect, it remains unclear how prediction-related neural mechanisms drive the attenuation prior to the actual self-touch input. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the neural correlates of self-touch prediction. Participants performed a self-touch task with two control conditions. In one control, the touch was externally generated without any movement. In the other, the moving and the touched hands were spatially misaligned, thereby disrupting the sensorimotor alignment of self-touch. Self-touch evoked weaker early somatosensory activity (M50 component) than both control conditions. A psychophysics task also mirrored the pattern of neural attenuation, as the perception of self-touch was attenuated compared to the two control conditions. To isolate predictive neural mechanisms from general movement-related activity, we subtracted activity from corresponding stimulus-absent trials. To further refine the signal specific to predictive processing in self-touch, we compared self-touch with misaligned touch, the two conditions that both involved voluntary movement but differed in their prediction of self-touch. This revealed greater pre-stimulus beta-band desynchronization and increased cerebellar-to-somatosensory connectivity prior to self-touch compared to misaligned touch. Our results provide the first evidence of predictive neural activity that shapes the sensory consequences of self-touch, offering insight into the mechanisms through which predictive models modulate somatosensory processing.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Super-resolution imaging with CRISPR-engineered UBR-1 and genetic results demonstrated that UBR-1 is expressed and functions in the nervous system including in pre-motor interneurons. To decipher mechanisms of UBR-1 function, we deployed CRISPR-based proteomics using C. elegans which identified a cadre of glutamate metabolic enzymes physically associated with UBR-1 including GLN-3, GOT-2.2, GFAT-1 and GDH-1. Similar to UBR-1, all four glutamate enzymes are genetically linked to human developmental and neurological deficits.

We found empirical data for 738 species across 1,478 populations: 354 populations were primarily solitary, 241 populations pair-living and 878 populations group-living. Notably, 383 species (52%) and 580 populations (39%) exhibited intra-specific variation in social organization. Using a Bayesian phylogenetic framework that incorporates intra-specific variation, we show that the ancestral placental mammal - living approximately 160 to 100 million years ago - was not exclusively solitary, but likely displayed intraspecific variation. Pair-living was predicted to account for approximately 26% of ancestral social organisation. Our analysis found that ecology and life history of extant solitary and pair-living mammals was very similar and different from those of group-living mammals.

The NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and its adaptor protein ASC play a critical role in initiating and maintaining inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. Although its acute activation is beneficial for host defense and homeostasis, chronic activation of the inflammasome has been associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Another key contributor to neuroinflammation is the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), particularly the G2019S mutation associated with PD, which has been shown to exacerbate inflammatory signaling in microglia and peripheral immune cells. However, the interaction between LRRK2 and the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of LRRK2-G2019S in the priming and activation dynamics of the NLRP3 inflammasome using mouse primary microglia and human monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (hMDMi). We observed that LRRK2-G2019S microglia exhibit increased expression of NLRP3 under basal conditions and spontaneous formation of ASC specks within the nucleus, an unexpected subcellular location not previously reported in microglia. Interestingly, nuclear ASC specks also formed in wild-type microglia and hMDMi after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming but only progressed to cytosolic ASC specks and interleukin-1{beta} release after subsequent exposure to canonical NLRP3 activators. These findings suggest that nuclear ASC specks may represent a primed state of inflammasome activation and propose a novel cellular phenotype associated with LRRK2-G2019S.

This condition produces multiple symptoms, including tumors, behavioral alterations, and metabolic changes. Molecularly, neurofibromin mutations affect Ras activity, influencing multiple downstream signaling pathways, including MAPK (Raf/MEK/ERK) and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. This pleiotropy raises the question of which pathways could be targeted to treat the disease symptoms, and whether different phenotypes driven by neurofibromin mutations exhibit similar or diverging dependence on the signaling pathways downstream of Ras. To test this, we examined metabolic and behavioral alterations in the genetically tractable Drosophila neurofibromatosis type 1 model. In vivo genetic analysis revealed that behavioral effects of neurofibromin were mediated by MEK signaling, with no necessity for Akt. In contrast, metabolic effects of neurofibromin were mediated by coordinated actions of MEK/ERK and Akt/mTOR/S6K/4E-BP signaling. At the systemic level, neurofibromin dysregulated metabolism via molecular effects of Nf1 in interneurons and muscle. These changes were accompanied by altered muscle mitochondria morphology, with no concomitant changes in neuronal ultrastructure or neuronal mitochondria.

Several studies have evaluated the reliability of these different methods and performance in comparison to one another. Typically, technical reliability, as measured by Pearsons correlation of two measurements of the same sample, is usually well above 90%, and is statistically significant even for small sample sizes (e.g., 8 samples measured twice). We performed an experiment where we aimed to compare hippocampal gene expression between 3 groups (n=5 per group) of young adult male C57BL/6J mice.

Our findings demonstrate that MeCP2 contributes to synaptic and circuit-level regulation in a cell type-specific manner within the NAc and ultimately mitigates CRS-induced depression-like behaviors.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Unlike actin and microtubules, purified intermediate filament proteins assemble into non-physiological structures, making it difficult to connect lamin functions to their assembly and regulation. To overcome this challenge, we reconstituted lamin assembly without nuclear assembly using interphase Xenopus laevis egg extracts that recapitulate physiological context. Mimicking nucleoplasm conditions triggers dispersed lamin assembly in egg extracts. Such ectopic lamin assembly occurs on nuclear pore complex-containing membranes, but does not recruit known nuclear lamina components, demonstrating that lamin assembly is separable from the rest of the nuclear lamina and nucleus. This assembly assay in the physiological context of cellular components opens the door to mechanistically dissecting nuclear lamina function in nuclear organization.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

These multifunctional organelles are also essential mechanosensors mediating the cell response to mechanical stress. We investigated the role of caveolae mechanics in regulating various signaling pathways. Single molecule imaging and super resolution microscopy revealed that mechanical stress rapidly triggers caveolae disassembly and the release of caveolin-1 scaffolds, which exhibit enhanced diffusion at the plasma membrane. This promoted direct interaction between the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain and the tyrosine kinase JAK1, leading to the inhibition of its catalytic activity. A similar interaction was observed for e-NOS, PTEN, and PTP1B. Remote control of signaling by caveolae was validated by a theoretical model based on caveolae thermodynamics.

Here, we developed in vitro and cellular CS biogenesis assays to spatiotemporally quantify the homeostatic properties of CS granules during assembly and maintenance. These assays revealed that CS assemble via a hierarchical pathway initiated by PCM1 scaffold formation followed by sequential recruitment of CS proteins. We discovered that PCM1 inherently forms granules through multimerization and phase separation, processes regulated by cytoskeleton and ciliopathy proteins. Additionally, PCM1 scaffold and clients are organized into subdomains within CS granules with distinct composition and dynamics. Selectively disrupting CS granule properties impaired the ciliary signaling functions of CS. Collectively, our results provide comprehensive insight into CS biogenesis and establish a conceptual framework and new tools to investigate context-dependent CS functions and their deregulation in disease.

In these cases, reaction-diffusion equations provide a valuable tool to learn how new dynamics could emerge from quantitative tuning of parameters. Bringing these models into quantitative correspondence with biological data remains an outstanding challenge, especially when the biology manifests heterogeneities that are difficult to account for mathematically. One particular example occurs in cell biology, where the membrane-bound regulatory protein RhoA interacts with the filamentous actin cortex in an activator-inhibitor loop. Though this core biochemical circuit is conserved across multiple cell types in different organisms, it produces different patterns of RhoA activity in different contexts, from traveling waves in starfish to transient pulses in C. elegans. To understand how this variation emerges, we develop an activator-inhibitor model that accounts explicitly for actin assembly and heterogeneity. We use the model to infer the parameters of actin dynamics responsible for each experimental phenotype, and find them to agree with independent measurements in most cases. To interpret parameter groupings, we use a simplified model to demonstrate how spatial and orientational randomness separately induce variation in spatiotemporal dynamics of RhoA activity. This work sheds light on how phenotypic diversity arises from heterogeneity and anisotropy, with important implications for the next generation of activator-inhibitor models.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Despite its well-characterized molecular framework, the biological relevance of this regulatory pathway remains unknown. Here, using human 3D cellular models, advanced optics, and genetic perturbation of tubulin biosynthesis, we reveal that loss of TTC5-dependent tubulin autoregulation elevates soluble tubulin levels, inducing microtubule hyperstability, and disrupting cytoskeletal organization.

These changes can be visualized by pan-Expansion Microscopy (pan-ExM), a 3D microscopy technique requiring only standard fluorescence microscopes, at a throughput exceeding that of the current gold standard, 3D electron microscopy, by orders of magnitude. However, a lack of tools that enable the characterization and quantification of the observed ultrastructural features in the acquired 3D datasets at a comparable throughput has hindered the widespread adoption of pan-ExM for quantitative imaging. Here, we present an automated deep-learning based segmentation approach that utilizes pan-ExM's power to acquire multi-channel images and uses specific labeling as the annotation for the training of the segmentation network. This 'molecular annotation' reduces the required manual annotation effort for mitochondria substructures to just a few hours when setting up the experiment and thereby provides access to 3D suborganellar morphology of mitochondria at an unprecedented throughput. Our approach, which we term 'MAPS' (Mitochondrial Automated Pan-ExM Segmentation), enables for the first time to quantify mitochondrial ultrastructural morphology at scale. We demonstrate this power by characterizing the 3D mitochondrial morphology at the organelle and sub-organelle level in tens of HeLa cells under different treatments and localizing mitochondrial proteins in the sub-organellar context. To demonstrate our technology in tissue, we compare the ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria in proximal tubules of kidneys of mice exhibiting acute kidney injury (AKI) with those of untreated mice, revealing striking differences in their cristae structure. MAPS can easily be adapted to different cell and tissue types, allowing the analysis of tens of samples per day, and therefore provides a versatile tool for a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial ultrastructural changes in many disease contexts.

This mutation is not found in hereditary VM, suggesting incompatibility with life when expressed during early vascular development. Therefore, we utilized a novel genetic mouse model that expresses TIE2 p.L914F to determine the phenotypical effects of this mutation during development. Results: B6-Tg(Rosa26-TIE2L914F)EBos (TIE2L914F) mice were generated and then validated for the presence of the transgene. The constitutive endothelial-specific Tie2-Cre line was used to activate expression of the mutant gene during early embryonic development. Tie2-Cre;TIE2L914F embryos experienced lethality at approximately embryonic day (E)9.5. 3-dimensional imaging of embryos and yolk sacs revealed impaired vascular remodeling in mutant animals, resulting in malformed vasculature with disorganized, dilated, and non-functional blood vessels. The abnormal vascular phenotype was not associated with total loss of erythroid cells or increased cell proliferation. Conclusions: The TIE2L914F mice used in this study represent a novel genetic model of TIE2 p.L914F-driven vascular disease. This study provides the first experimental evidence that this mutation is incompatible with early prenatal development due to its deleterious effects on the vasculature, illustrating the vital role of TIE2 signaling during vessel development and remodeling.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Most of the genes (80%) are expressed in the adult brain, including 24 neuron- and 13 glia-specific expression patterns. Overall, we identify 50 candidate AD risk gene homologs with requirements for CNS structure or function, including 18 whose loss of function causes neurodegeneration (e.g., Snx6/SNX32 and ClC-a/CLCN1), 35 required for neurophysiology (e.g., Arr1/ARRB2, stai/STMN4), and 8 with diminished CNS resilience following a thermal or mechanical stress (e.g., cindr/CD2AP, Amph/BIN1).

Here, a high-entropy atom nanozyme (HEAzyme), PtNiBiSnSb-anti-CD36, is designed for efficient anti-tumor immunotherapy. The PtNiBiSnSb HEAzyme, incorporating five SAzyme, demonstrates enhanced peroxidase (POD)-like activity due to its abundant active sites, showing a 7.2-fold increase in catalytic efficiency compared to the structurally analogous PtBi nanozyme. Further integrating of density functional theory calculations and machine learning analysis reveals that the main reason is due to the addition of Ni, Sn, and Sb, which reduced the reaction energy barrier and changed the adsorption energy of surface hydroxyl groups. Moreover, PtNiBiSnSb-anti-CD36 not only inhibits normal metabolic processes by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) through its enhanced NADH-POD-like activity, but also suppresses lipid metabolism by blocking CD36-mediated uptake. The dual metabolic inhibition facilitates the mild photothermal therapy induced by PtNiBiSnSb. In this process, the anti-tumor immune response is amplified by inducing immunogenic cell death and inhibiting the growth of immunosuppressive cells through blocking fatty acid uptake.

The mRNA expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in tumor mass were estimated by real time-RT-qPCR. In addition, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation analyses were conducted on the reported compounds. In the in vivo chemopreventive activity assessment, the peel extract at 500 mg/kg was found effective in reducing total tumor number, yield, burden, incidence, and weight. Total proteins and endogenous antioxidants (GSH, SOD, CAT) levels in liver and skin tissues from mice were significantly (P<0.05) elevated. In addition, the HPPE at 500 mg/kg dose significantly reduced (P<0.05) the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-18, and inflammatory mediators like TGF-{beta}1, COX-2, and NF{kappa}B. In the molecular docking studies, reported compounds including Quercimeritrin, Rutin, and Kaempferol 3-O-{beta}-D-glucopyranoside were identified as the top-performing compounds, with a docking score of -7.4, -7.1 and -7.0 kcal/mol against TGF-{beta}1 protein.

It is shown how evolutionary selection under resource scarcity optimises the MM towards (a) light-weight design and (b) resource efficiency. Thus, Darwin's evolution by natural selection is simulated by model-based optimisation. The final model presented is complete (for the entire mass range of the organism of different taxonomic classes), concise (it uses only five scale-invariant physicochemical constants), clear (it predicts all metabolic rates within the uncertainty range of a scale model observed in measurements) and consistent with Murray's law of capillary blood flow and cell metabolism.

Surprisingly, to date there is still no metabolic scaling theory that links cellular respiration to the organismal metabolism and predicts the 'mouse-to-elephant curve', also known as Kleiber's law, in an approach that is consistent with physicochemical principles. This paper shows that for a consistent model, the novel concept of the optimised Metabolic Module (MM) is the missing link between cell and organism. It is shown how evolutionary selection under resource scarcity optimises the MM towards (a) light-weight design and (b) resource efficiency. Thus, Darwin's evolution by natural selection is simulated by model-based optimisation. The final model presented is complete (for the entire mass range of the organism of different taxonomic classes), concise (it uses only five scale-invariant physicochemical constants), clear (it predicts all metabolic rates within the uncertainty range of a scale model observed in measurements) and consistent with Murray's law of capillary blood flow and cell metabolism. The model features observed asymptotes for both 'small' protists and 'large' endotherms. It predicts the mass-dependent metabolic rate of protists, planarians, ectotherms and endotherms with the usual uncertainty of any scaling theory.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Emerging techniques that couple single-cell genomics with Cas9-based genome editing open the way for in-depth analysis of cell phylogenies that underlie processes of clonal expansion, selection and diversification, from embryogenesis to cancer. A key distinguishing feature of cell lineage analysis with these techniques is the non-modifiability of Cas9-induced mutations, which motivates revisiting questions in phylogenetics. In this work, we ask one such fundamental question: is it possible to assess the reliability of an inferred lineage tree, even though we do not know its underlying ground truth? We present a homoplasy-based approach for this question that leverages the non-modifiability property. We show via simulations that under a broad range of settings, our method can effectively distinguish accurate reconstructions out of a pool of candidate solutions. Importantly, our homoplasy-based score is substantially more powerful than the commonly used parsimony score - a result that we back by both empirical and theoretical analysis. The computation of the homoplasy score is simple and scalable, thus opening the way for more rigorous analysis of cell lineages.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a novel model pathosystem to explore the interaction between the globally distributed eukaryotic microparasite, Pirsonia, and its host, the bloom-forming diatom, Coscinodiscus. Culture conditions recapitulated Pirsonia's rapid life cycle in vitro and live-cell imaging enabled quantitative assessments of infection dynamics and host mortality. To investigate the genetic basis of this interaction, we assembled the Pirsonia genome and identified unique genetic innovations relative to their oomycete relatives. Time-resolved dual RNA-Seq enabled tracking of parasite gene expression through the infection cycle and revealed an upregulation of an expanded multi-gene family of integrin-like proteins in Pirsonia zoospores, analogous to the variable surface proteins in other parasitic lineages. Genes upregulated during infection were associated with cytoskeletal dynamics and drug inhibition assays confirmed that actin is required for host infection, consistent with the presence of parasitic pseudopodia on infected hosts. The dependence on both actin-based phagocytic mechanisms and parasitic-like surface proteins highlights Pirsonia's intermediate state between predator and parasite, providing new insights into the evolution of parasite strategies and the complex cellular interactions controlling parasitic shunts in marine trophic networks.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "The search for fundamental relationships between energetic and biosynthetic parameters of catabolism and anabolism is a major goal in microbiology. This is complicated by the fact that ATP synthesis is required for some anabolic precursors, all building blocks, and their polymerization into macromolecules, while the synthesis of other anabolic precursors and catabolic products yields ATP. Yield parameters were classically predicted from approximate phenomenological relations between catabolic and anabolic stoichiometry. Here we compare the catabolisms of a diverse set of microbial species across conditions using genome-scale stoichiometric models. We focus on states of maximal energetic efficiency (maximal yield of biomass of the energy source) and present an unbiased method for calculating stoichiometric relations between catabolism and anabolism. We find that synthesis of charged energy-carriers and anabolic precursors by catabolism is strongly intertwined. Catabolic intermediates and reactions vary greatly, due to variation in the energy and carbon source for growth. We find that the ATP requirement for 1 gram biomass varies between 72.8 and 246.1 moles, precursor sets vary between 4 and 14 in size, and acetyl-CoA is the only common precursor across species. We conclude that the complex interplay between precursor synthesis and energy conservation of heterotrophic catabolism results from an optimal compromise between conflicting objectives. The state of maximal energetic efficiency is reached by minimizing the carbon source lost during energy catabolism due to catabolic-product formation. This choice is influenced by the need for an optimal precursor set that compromises between maximal ATP production during its formation from the carbon source and minimal ATP consumption when it is converted into building blocks. We find that the associated optimal catabolic pathways are diverse across species and conditions.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Loss of SORLA function is known to disrupt endosomal trafficking and enhance amyloidogenic APP processing, two key aspects of the onset and progression of AD. However, the pathogenic consequences of disrupted endolysosomal pathways, deregulated protein sorting, as well as the effects of specific SORL1 missense variants on human neuronal function, still remain understudied. Methods: Our investigations were performed using two complementary human iPSC-derived models: 2D NGN2-induced neurons and 3D cerebral organoids established from isogenic wild-type (WT), SORL1 p.Y1816C (KI) missense variant, and SORL1 knock-out (KO) cells. We analyzed SORLA maturation and ectodomain shedding, APP localization, and amyloid-{beta} secretion. Endosomal morphology and neuritic swellings were assessed via electron microscopy, while axonal transport of APP and Rab5+ endosomes was evaluated through live-cell imaging. Neuronal network activity was measured using multielectrode array recordings. Results: Our results demonstrate that the p.Y1816C variant leads to impaired SORLA maturation and reduced shedding, without affecting neuronal or organoid differentiation. Notably, we show an ultrastructure of endosomes, including their content, and demonstrate that both KO and KI models exhibit early endosome enlargement, increased APP retention in endosomes, elevated A{beta}40/42 secretion, and amyloid-{beta} deposition in 3D organoids. Importantly, we identified previously uncharacterized functional consequences of abolished SORLA activity, including axonal swellings and significantly impaired transport of Rab5+ endosomes and APP, characterized by deregulated velocities, directionality of transport, and increased stalling. Additionally, we discovered that both KO and p.Y1816C KI neurons exhibit abnormal electrophysiological activity, including increased spontaneous firing, burst frequency, and network synchrony. Conclusions: Our study defines the mechanistic consequences of the SORL1 p.Y1816C variant and demonstrates its pathogenicity in human neurons. Importantly, we also identify novel roles for SORLA in maintaining axonal transport homeostasis and regulating neuronal excitability, expanding its functional relevance beyond endosomal APP processing. These findings reinforce the central role of endosomal trafficking disruption in AD and support the use of isogenic human models for evaluating AD risk variants.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Using a custom-made computational method involving a Support Vector Machine, we dissected the different regulatory modes through which chromatin states affect transcription. We found that regulation of the Polycomb-mediated histone modification H3K27me3 at specific gene loci exhibited the most consistent differences among iPSC lines, frequently displaying a digital pattern (i.e., binary ON/OFF). We developed a mathematical model based on the read-write feedback of the Polycomb complex, which explained this behaviour. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the heterogeneity in digital Polycomb regulation mirrors the transcriptomic variability across the iPSC lines studied here. Notably, Polycomb heterogeneity was also correlated with the differentiation potentials of the iPSC lines, suggesting that chromatin variability could be one important factor influencing iPSC differentiation potential.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

One of these cues, carbon dioxide (CO2), gates odorant and heat pathways and activates host-seeking behavior. The neuronal circuits underlying processing of CO2 information remain unclear. We used automated serial-section transmission electron microscopy (EM) to image and reconstruct the circuitry of the glomeruli that are innervated by the Ae. aegypti maxillary palp, including the glomerulus that responds to CO2. Notably, CO2-sensitive olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) make high levels of recurrent synaptic connections with one another, while making a low density of feedforward synapses. At some of these contacts between CO2 OSNs, we observe ribbon-like presynaptic structures, which may further enhance recurrent signaling. We compared both feedforward and recurrent connectivity with all olfactory glomeruli in Drosophila melanogaster, and we found more recurrent connections between the Ae. aegypti CO2-responsive OSNs than in any D. melanogaster glomeruli. We developed a computational circuit model that demonstrates recurrent synapses are necessary for robust CO2 detection under normal physiological conditions. Together, elevated levels of recurrent connectivity and ribbon-like structures may amplify sensory information detected by CO2-sensitive OSNs to support mosquito activation and sensitization by CO2, even in the presence of high levels of other odorants in the environment. We propose that this circuit organization supports the salience of CO2 as a mosquito host cue.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

A total of 151 S. enterica sequences were assembled using SPAdes and subsequently quality-filtered with Abyss and BUSCO. Prophage sequences were detected using Phigaro and CheckV, followed by quality assessment with PHASTEST. The identification was performed using a custom database comprising 60 S. enterica prophages from previous studies. Comparative genomics, including gene annotation and recombination detection, were performed on representative prophages. Virulence genes were identified using VFDB and VirulenceFinder databases. Lastly, phylogenetic analysis of the prophages was carried out based on terminase and integrase sequences. We obtained 142 S. enterica genomes to analyze their prophage content. Peduovirus pro483 was highly prevalent among S. Infantis isolates and carried two cargo proteins: an Imma/Irre metalloendopeptidase and a fimbrial protein. In contrast, a related S.

Instead of invaginating as a continuous sheet, the separated membranes extend independently to partition the cytoplasm. This separation creates membrane discontinuities, widely observed in electron microscopy (EM) sections, both between the sister membranes and within individual sister cells. The exposed cytoplasmic regions are shielded by extracellular matrix components, likely preventing massive leakage.

However, considering the wide distribution of G. brevipalpis in Southeast Africa and the major epidemiological implications of the aforementioned observations, this study was designed to re-assess the vectorial competence of G. brevipalpis in the transmission of T. congolense-savannah type. The research involved 915 G. brevipalpis flies, fed six times on two cattle infected with T. congolense. After 48 hours, the flies were later fed on a non-infected animal to clean the proboscis, followed by extended feeding on four susceptible cattle for 22 days. These five clean animals were monitored for 60 days based on body temperature, packed cell volume, buffy coat technique and polymerase chain reaction. In the meantime, flies were dissected weekly to observe the development of trypanosomes in the midgut and proboscis. To discard any possible mechanical transmission by G. brevipalpis 48 hours after an infected blood meal, 97 flies from a colony were fed once on two infected cattle and once on a susceptible bovine. The Spearman correlation and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyse the data. Results showed that the four susceptible cattle became infected with T. congolense, while the animal used for proboscis cleaning and discard any mechanical transmission remained uninfected. Dissections revealed that 89% of flies were positive for trypanosome through microscopy and 100% through PCR.

We assess temporal trends in mammal species descriptions (1990-2022) using four proxies of comprehensiveness-counts of examined specimens and compared taxa, number of pages (only from the Methods/Results sections), and number of evidence lines (i.e., analytical tools and techniques). Using generalised linear models, we assessed how these proxies are explained by factors associated with species' biology, geography, and taxonomic practice. Most new species derive from tropical regions, particularly rodents and bats, reflecting global discovery hotspots. Descriptions have grown more rigorous over time, with expanded specimen sampling, broader taxonomic comparisons, and integrative methods. However, disparities emerge along geographic and biological axes: temperate-region descriptions incorporate more evidence lines, while small-bodied and tropical species (especially bats) remain understudied due to sampling biases and resource limitations. Body size inversely correlates with description length, as smaller species often require advanced diagnostics. Species-rich genera show greater comprehensiveness, likely due to heightened diagnostic scrutiny, though bats exhibit the opposite trend, possibly due to taxon-specific sampling challenges.

Previous work has shown that visual impairment can disrupt the implicit, automatic adjustments made by the sensorimotor system. But how visual impairment influences the explicit motor adaptation, a cornerstone of rehabilitation, remains unknown. To address this gap, we recruited individuals with low vision - defined as uncorrectable visual impairment resulting in functional vision loss - and age-matched controls to complete a visuomotor task designed to isolate two components of explicit motor adaptation: discovering a new deliberate sensorimotor strategy and recalling a previously learned one.

To evaluate this theory, we examined grasp behavior in human participants as they caught balls of four diameters (2.5 to 9 cm) thrown toward them. Hand shaping during catching was compared with that observed during the pickup of stationary balls and the interception of rolling balls. Kinematic measures included digit opposition distance (thumb pad to index finger pad) and prehension span (digit pad to palm distance), obtained using electromagnetic sensors, 3D video capture, and frame-by-frame video analysis. Participants displayed significantly greater hand opening when catching thrown balls than when interacting with static or rolling balls. Nonetheless, the maximum pregrasp aperture (MPA), contact grasp aperture (CGA), and terminal grasp aperture (TGA) scaled proportionally with ball size across all conditions. Ball size further influenced grasp type: small thrown balls were caught with power grips, while larger balls were caught with precision grips. In contrast, precision grips were used consistently when picking up stationary balls or grasping intercepting rolling ones. In the catching condition, grasp type and the trajectory of digit closure were also affected by the location of ball to hand contact. These findings support the dual visuomotor channel theory by demonstrating that anticipatory hand opening reflects target location, whereas grip selection reflects target size. Moreover, the modulation of grasp type and digit closure by tactile contact suggests that somatosensory input may operate within a dual-channel framework analogous to that of vision.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

While its ligand, 4-1BBL, is typically expressed by professional antigen-presenting cells, several carcinomas also express 4-1BBL; however, its function in the tumor microenvironment remains poorly defined. Methods: We analyzed 4-1BBL expression across human tumors and found that papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) expresses the highest levels of the ligand. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found high 4-1BBL expression correlated with poor overall survival in pRCC. To study its role in vivo, we established an orthotopic humanized mouse model of pRCC by grafting ACHN cells into the renal capsule of mice reconstituted with human CD34-hematopoietic stem cells. We then performed CRISPR-mediated deletion of 4-1BBL in tumor cells, followed by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Results: Loss of tumor-derived 4-1BBL resulted in accelerated tumor growth and decreased immune cell clustering. In the absence of 4-1BBL, CD8+ T cells displayed elevated expression of PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, granzyme B, perforin, and NKG7, indicating a cytotoxic yet exhausted phenotype. Tregs were only modestly impacted. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells expressed high levels of 4-1BBL and showed transcriptional signatures of altered AP-1 factors and enhanced PI3K pathway signaling.

Drawing from diverse inputs, we present a curated list of 101 research questions spanning across the various disciplines in ornithology: Natural History, Physiology and Disease Ecology, Behaviour, Population and Community Ecology, Habitat Ecology, Macroecology and Biogeography, Population Genetics and Evolution, Applied/Economic Ornithology and Conservation. The list was compiled through a multi-stage process, starting with a public open call for questions, followed by review and curation by a smaller panel of subject specialists. Each question was independently scored by a panel of experts based on three criteria: generality, novelty, and relevance. To account for variation in scoring styles, scores were normalised using Z-scores. The top 101 research questions were then selected based on these standardised scores. Each question is accompanied by an annotation that describes the significance of the question, and highlights opportunities to address it. While our list of research questions highlights significant research priorities, it is not intended to be exhaustive. Rather, it reflects the perspectives of those involved in its curation, who deemed these questions particularly relevant and impactful towards advancing Indian ornithology. We expect these questions to spark new project ideas among students, researchers, and citizen scientists, while guiding funders, managers, and policymakers toward priority research areas.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Pollinators are crucial for terrestrial ecosystems and global food security, but their populations are declining from multiple stressors including pollution and climate change. The effects of plastic pollution alone or in interaction with climate change on pollinators remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate sublethal microplastic exposure effects on pollinators at individual, colony and network level in combination with heating to simulate climate warming. We conducted a one-generation trial on 30 bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies in a customized beekeeping structure with a nesting and a foraging room, where colonies were maintained under optimal temperature (25 degrees Celsius) or heated condition (30 degrees Celsius), and fed with oil-seed rape pollens and 50% w/w sucrose solution containing 0, 10, or 100 mg/L 30 microgram polyethylene beads. Real-time tracking with object detection (F1 = 83%) and matrix code scanning showed that microplastic exposure and heat significantly stimulated individual activity and altered labor division. Workers shifted to nursing behaviors and foraged more frequently for sucrose solution and less for pollen. Brood development was impaired by up to 48%, and colony population growth was restrained by 12 to 15%. Microplastic exposure and heating also significantly intensified social interactions and increased the dominance of the queen in her colony. These findings suggest that plastic pollution has complex, cross-level impacts on bumblebee colonies and their pollination potential, which may be exacerbated under climate change.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Using genome-wide pleiotropy analysis in ~480,000 UK Biobank participants, we show that the G risk allele (Pro107) increases morningness, BMI, and fat mass in European (N=451,324) and African (N=8,738) ancestry groups, with behavioral amplification by morning difficulty awakening observed in Europeans, power limited interaction modeling in other populations. Structural modeling and transcriptomic analysis suggest this allele destabilizes ADCY3 and alters adipose-specific splicing and expression. In mice, Adcy3 is rhythmically expressed in adipose tissue, with the conserved Pro107 site showing BMAL1 binding and cold-inducible activation. Human adipose ADCY3 expression also increases after weight loss. Together, these findings reveal a genotype-dependent, behaviorally modifiable axis linking difficulty awakening to adipose thermogenesis and obesity risk.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

To address the gap in research on the leaf biomass partitioning coefficient model in the crop growth model, we developed the leaf biomass partitioning coefficient model for the main-stem at different leaf ranks in rapeseed. The outdoor experiment with cultivars, Ningyou 18 (V1, conventional), Ningyou 16 (V2, conventional), and Ningza 19 (V3, hybrid), and designed treatment of cultivars x fertilizer x transplanting density in the 2012-2015 growth season. The model was fitted by calculating the ratio of leaf biomass at different leaf ranks on the main-stem to the total leaf biomass on the main-stem, and normalizing the leaf ranks into (0-1] interval. We parameterized the model variables to elucidate how cultivar and environmental conditions influence the leaf biomass partitioning coefficients for different leaf ranks. The descriptive models were validated with independent experimental data, the correlation (r) of simulation and observation values all greater than 0.9 with significant levels at p < 0.001. The absolute values of the average absolute difference (da) are all less than 0.011 g g-1. The ratio of da to the average observation (dap) for the normalized leaf rank, and leaf biomass partitioning coefficient at seedling stage, and budding and bolting stage, and blooming stage, and mature stage are 13.599%, 11.236%, 11.312%, 3.077%, and 8.661%, respectively.

We integrated bulk whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from patient-derived organoid lines generated from drug resistant gastric tumors of three patients before and after chemotherapy with FLOT (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel), investigating both in vivo and ex vivo treatment effects. We found that inter-patient variability of gene expression exceeds intra-patient differences and predominantly shapes the expression profiles. Integration of WGS-inferred cancer phylogenies with scRNA-seq data allowed us to associate genetic clones with the individual cells' transcriptional program and to track the genetic and transcriptomic history of dominant genetic clones in post-treatment samples relative to the corresponding primary tumor. Notably, in vivo treated samples appeared to be transcriptionally distinct from the untreated counterparts, marked by sustained NF-kB down-regulation, which suggests that they retain an immune-mediated imprint of the prior therapy. Changes in the clonal composition of a tumor alone cannot explain the post-chemotherapy NF-kB-associated transcriptional reprogramming. Instead, non-genetic mechanisms shape the altered transcriptomic landscape, particularly a distinct subpopulation of epithelial cells that specifically express pro-inflammatory cytokines, key components of the NF-kB regulatory network. These observations support a model of transcriptional reprogramming after FLOT treatment, which is most likely independent of genetic evolution and consequently potentially reversible. Downregulated NF-kB signaling may thus represent a candidate pathway change for predictive response assessment and/or NF-kB-stimulating co-therapeutic strategies to overcome FLOT resistance.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

This investigation was undertaken to determine the effect of shifting sowing date on a cohort of six high yielding spring wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.), by delaying sowing date 15 and 30 days in a two-year field trial, aiming to highlight agronomic traits contributing to sustained yield potential under heat stress induced by late sowing, with a focus on identifying tolerant cultivars. Our findings showed that heat stress during grain filling was less detrimental compared to its occurrence during anthesis. Late sowing shifted the timing of heat stress, resulting in floral abortion and significantly reduced number of grains/spike, consequently imposing 42% yield penalty, underscoring number of grains/spike stability as key factor to sustain yield under heat stress during anthesis. On the contrary, harvest index of sowing delayed by 30 days was significantly higher compared to both 15 days late sowing and the optimum sowing date, suggesting that decline in biological yield exceeded that of grain yield. Upon shifting sowing date, the strength of traits association is altered, grain yield associations strongest positive correlation in the 30 day late sowing was plant height (r=0.86), in the 15 days late sowing was number of total tillers/m2 (r=0.63) and in optimum sowing date was biological yield (r= 0.62), suggesting that grain yield enhancement through selected traits with direct or indirect contributions should be evaluated independently across different growing conditions.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Successful memory formation is typically associated with reduced alpha/beta power (i.e., the alpha/beta subsequent memory effect) and an increased number of eye movements. However, the functional relevance of these two memory correlates has primarily been investigated in isolation, leaving their coupling and combined contribution to memory formation largely unknown. Here, we address this gap through four experiments involving simultaneous eye-tracking and scalp or intracranial electroencephalography recordings while participants viewed scenes either freely or under varying levels of visual constraint. Across experiments and cohorts, we identified the degree of visual exploration, rather than subsequent memory performance, as the consistent and robust modulator of alpha/beta power reductions. Moreover, we show that saccade parameters predicted the dynamics of alpha/beta activity, and that the accumulation of saccades over time accounted for the reduced alpha/beta power. Our work demonstrates that neglecting eye movements results in an incomplete understanding of the alpha/beta subsequent memory effect. Together, the evidence points at alpha/beta activity directly reflecting eye movements, and only indirectly, memory formation. The current study thus bridges two lines of previous research and advocates for new perspectives on the specific interpretation of the alpha/beta subsequent memory effect and on the function of alpha/beta activity in general.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

An attenuated pharyngeal colonizing variant (S126) possessing a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CovS (Y39H) was recovered in France from a member of a family in which another individual developed NF and STSS caused by the M1T1 WT strain (S119). We employed transcriptome analyses (RNA-seq), quantitative determinations of CovR phosphorylation, measurements of virulence factor activity, and a murine model of human NF to demonstrate that CovS of strain S126 almost lost its entire phosphatase activity but retained its kinase and phosphotransfer activities. Moreover, we reversed its attenuated phenotype by ectopically expressing the cytosolic domain of wild-type CovS. Culturing the corresponding strain S126covS-3' in a chemically defined medium (CDM) supplemented with asparagine (Asn), conditions that produce an excess of cytosolic ADP over ATP, stimulated the ectopically expressed phosphatase activity. Consequently, this led to dephosphorylation of CovR~P and increased the expression of virulence factors. Most importantly, S126covS-3' reverted to the wild-type phenotype of S119 in the mouse model of human GAS NF.

Objectives To investigate the role of drug tolerance in delayed culture conversion and resistance amplification in TB patients. Methods We collected serial Mtb isolates from i) patients with drug-susceptible TB who remained culture positive for up to 6 years (i.e. recalcitrant TB), and ii) patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) where resistance amplified during treatment. We measured tolerance to rifampicin (RIF) in drug-susceptible TB strains and tolerance to moxifloxacin (MFX) in MDR-TB strains using a real-time time-kill assay. Results RIF tolerance evolved within-host, increasing up to and ~1.5-fold, however, there was no apparent contribution of RIF tolerance to delayed culture conversion. Tolerance to Mfx in MDR-TB patients appeared negatively associated with resistance amplification and consistently decreased over time in patients.

Retinal ganglion cells (RGC), the only output neurons of the retina, show a steady increase in numbers during development except for two waves of cell death that are highly conserved in vertebrates. However, the mechanisms responsible for these phenomena and their conservation in the human retina are incompletely understood. In this work we took advantage of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal organoids to explore these questions. Using different markers and quantitative techniques in three different hiPSC lines, we found a consistent decrease in RGC numbers at week 8 of differentiation, a developmental stage that is equivalent to that of the first wave of RGC death in other species. This decrease coincided with a peak in caspase 3 activation and TUNEL(+) staining, suggesting an apoptotic mechanism. Notably, this was accompanied by a decrease in the BAX/BCL2 ratio and a lack of caspase 9 activation. However, we observed a marked increase in caspase 8 activation at this stage, suggesting the involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Together, these results show for the first time the intrinsic ability of the human retina to regulate RGC numbers through programmed cell death mechanisms, which could lead to new insights regarding congenital retinal abnormalities.

In this work, we study one of the most important examples of this, namely, a coastal ecosystem interacting with a tropical cyclone, one of the strongest extreme weather events. We show, that the ecosystem, while perfectly self-sustainable when unperturbed, nevertheless undergoes a reduction in habitat quality when impacted by the extreme event. We show that a certain degree of dispersal between the affected patch and a less affected patch leads to non-zero population density, whereas the population of an uncoupled but affected patch suffers extinction. We also demonstrate that dispersal between two equally affected coastal ecosystems, eventually leads to the extinction of their populations. We show that the critical degree of dispersal for the persistence of the ecosystems under the onslaught of extreme events increases with both damage-proneness of the ecosystem and ferocity of the extreme event. We analyze the response of an affected coastal ecosystem under increasing dispersal and check for synchronization between the affected and the safer inland ecosystem. We also investigate the impact of extreme events on the ecosystems situated in extremely fragmented habitats. We find that even though a dispersally connected ecosystem still has more chance of survival in a fragmented habitat, the required degree of dispersal is significantly larger than that of an ecosystem in an unfragmented habitat.

Materials and methods Patients were selected from those receiving standard colonoscopy based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, to minimize potential confounding factors such as previous colorectal surgeries, inflammatory bowel diseases, and the use of antibiotics or probiotics. Fecal samples were collected before bowel preparation for the colonoscopy procedure, and metagenomic shotgun sequencing was used to analyze the composition and functions of the gut microbiome. Results Overall, 136 participants were recruited, and 56 of them had colorectal adenomas. Although no distinction was observed in alpha diversity, beta diversity analysis indicated significant differences between the adenoma-positive and adenoma-negative groups. Signs of dysbiosis were found in patients with adenomas: increased abundance of the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella and decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium and Anaerostipes species. Beta diversity analysis showed statistically significant differences in the structure of the microbiota. Significant differences in the relative abundance of UBA7597 sp003448195 were observed between groups.

Here we show a universal selection principle for karyotypes composed entirely of disomies and trisomies that is conserved across many different cancer types and even in yeast. This finding is surprising enough on its own, as cancers do not typically have generalized trends, but we also see that these karyotypes exhibit a 3 times lower mutation rate of the cancer suppressor gene TP53 compared to other aneuploid karyotypes. We find that, in general, karyotypes composed of combinations of any two chromosome copy numbers, termed binary karyotypes, make up over three-quarters of the Mitelman database, which we explain by a 15% increased fitness relative to other aneuploid karyotypes.

In order to understand these impacts and minimize their effects, scientists use molecular xenomonitoring techniques to understand their distribution and track elimination efforts.

Next-generation sequencing offers the ability to detect multiple species of coinfecting filarial nematodes and thus improve are ability to monitor, treat, and eliminate these pathogens. In this paper, we have developed a deep amplicon sequencing approach using filarial nematode primers targeting the cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (coxI) gene. To replicate molecular xenomonitoring conditions, third stage larvae (L3) of three species of filarioid nematodes (Brugia malayi, Brugia pahangi, Dirofilaria immitis) were spiked in different proportions to pools comprising various amounts of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (0, 10, 50, 100).

Two sets of demultiplexing pipelines were utilized to optimize this novel approach, each reaching, 92.71% and 97.92% accuracy in identification of species composition across mock pools. However, in heterogenous pools, filarial species D. immitis exhibited an overrepresentation of reads and B. pahangi an underrepresentation of reads.

The mechanistic details underlying functional ODA assembly and the specific roles of DNAAFs in orchestrating subunit translation, folding, and assembly are still poorly defined. Using Trypanosoma brucei as a model, we showed that ODA preassembly is coupled to HC translation, during which ICs posttranslationally associate with translating HCs to form co-translational assembly sites. PIH1D1, a DNAAF and a PIH family protein, concentrates at these cotranslational assembly sites. Without PIH1D1, HC protein levels are reduced, leaving the IC-LC complex stranded in the cytoplasm. We propose that PIH1D1 generates specialised compartments to assist the co-translational folding of HCs and enable their assembly with the other ODA subunits. Our study highlights spatial compartmentalization as a conserved strategy that interweaves translation, folding, and assembly to ensure ordered and timely ODA formation during ciliogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "In Drosophila, germline cysts arise through synchronous mitotic divisions and acquire a polarized architecture organized by the fusome, which guides oocyte specification and supports meiotic progression. Similar cyst structures exist in non-mammalian vertebrate ovaries, but their polarity and function have remained uncertain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution imaging, we reconstructed the germ cell differentiation trajectory in Xenopus laevis and uncovered striking parallels with invertebrate and mouse cyst development. We identified a distinct germline stem cell (GSC) population marked by piwil4, low translational activity, and expression of neuronal-specific and transposon-silencing genes. Downstream from GSCs, during cyst development, an asymmetric fusome-like structure (FLS) composed of stable microtubules forms a rosette-like connection between cystocytes and co-localizes with Golgi vesicles and ER, suggesting polarized trafficking. In contrast to previous claims, ~90% of EdU-prelabeled cyst cells turned over rather than forming oocytes, consistent with a nurse cell fate. The striking parallels described here between cyst and fusome formation, polarization, cyst breakdown, and nurse cell turn over to produce relatively few oocytes, argue that amphibian cysts have important functions in female gametogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Using quantitative imaging and tissue-specific perturbations, we analyzed the dynamic remodeling of skin cells allowing the expansion of the orifice edge. We identified the sensory cavity located in the center of the placodal rosette as a crucial player that sets the size of the growing epithelial hole in the skin. We further showed that fine-tuning of actomyosin contractility within each tissue (skin and sensory cavity) exerts non-autonomous effects on the neighboring tissue, thereby shaping the nostril structure.

YAP and its paralog TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) play essential roles in the Hippo pathway to control tissue and organ size. In addition, YAP is critically involved in numerous cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, cell migration and cancer metastasis as well as mechanotransduction and cytoskeletal dynamics. The actin cytoskeleton controls YAP activity in multiple ways via tensile forces, cell density and cell-cell adhesion as well as shear stress or other biomechanical cues. Here we discover YAP as a novel G-actin binding protein. We identify three high affinity YAP actin binding sites involving critical residues within the N-terminus of YAP. Moreover, actin binding to YAP is necessary for its transcriptional activity and function such as during cell density control. Mutation of the three actin binding residues results in a loss of nuclear YAP co-activator function towards TEAD while actin binding to YAP is required for TEAD target gene regulation. Our data point towards the formation of a dynamic TEAD/YAP/actin ternary complex necessary for transcription.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Addressing this, we developed a novel proteomic strategy combining lipid droplet (LD) enrichment with mass spectrometry against the database of sORF-derived proteins. This approach yielded the first reported LD-resident microprotein, LDANP1, and subsequently revealed other candidates from the same screen, such as MNP33, were localized to mitochondria. Here, we provide the first in-depth functional characterization of MNP33, a novel 28-amino acid protein encoded by an sORF within the Cdhr4 gene locus. We confirm MNP33 localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane and demonstrate its interaction with the adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2). Functionally, MNP33 expression remodels mitochondrial bioenergetics, increasing basal respiration and proton leak while paradoxically elevating membrane potential, partly through modulating ANT2 activity linked to enhanced glycolysis. Furthermore, MNP33 shifts cellular lipid metabolism, favoring cholesteryl ester storage over triacylglycerols via stabilization of ACAT1, and is associated with closer ER-mitochondria contacts. MNP33 also induces ROS production and autophagy while inhibiting cell proliferation without increasing apoptosis. This study establishes MNP33 as a novel mitochondrial regulator emerging from the dark proteome, providing a mechanistic link between non-coding genetic elements, ANT2 function, mitochondrial bioenergetics, cellular metabolism, and stress responses. Our work highlights functional importances of the dark proteins and validates organelle-focused proteomics for discovering key cellular regulators.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

J.; Bassler, B.", "abstract": "Temperate phages oscillate between lysogeny, a genomic maintenance state within a bacterial host, and lytic replication, in which the host is killed, and newly made phage particles are released. Successful transmission to new hosts requires that temperate phages appropriately time their transitions from lysogeny to lysis. It is well understood that temperate phages trigger lysis upon detection of host cell stress. Understanding of the breadth of cues that induce lysis expanded with the discovery of phages carrying quorum-sensing receptor genes that promote lytic induction exclusively at high host cell density. Bacteria engage in a cell-cell communication process called quorum sensing, which relies on the production, release, accumulation, and group-wide detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. Bacteria use quorum sensing to monitor changes in population density and synchronize collective behaviors. The temperate phage VP882 (jVP882) encodes VqmAj - a homolog of its hosts quorum-sensing receptor/transcription factor VqmA. VqmAj allows jVP882 to detect the accumulation of the host autoinducer called DPO. Presumably, launching the lytic induction program at high host cell density maximizes jVP882 transmission to new hosts. Here, by mining sequence databases for linear plasmid phages, we identify VP882-like phages in multiple DPO-producing bacterial species isolated at diverse times and geographic locations. We show that the VqmAj homologs can indeed detect DPO and, in response, activate the lytic pathway. Our observation indicates that jVP882 is a member of a large family of globally-dispersed quorum-sensing-responsive temperate phages.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

A particular pathogen of concern is multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is implicated in over 1 million deaths worldwide yearly. One potential class of novel antimicrobials is extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have been found to have intrinsic antimicrobial and anti-virulence properties. Here, the antimicrobial activity of EVs on P. aeruginosa was explored in the context of biofilms of hyper-virulent strain PA14. We identified the human monocyte cell line THP-1 as a promising source of EVs for this application, inducing reduced PA14 biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. THP-1 EVs were not found to affect P. aeruginosa growth planktonically within the biofilm assay or in shaken culture. Additionally, we demonstrate that anti-biofilm effects were conserved with similar efficacy across THP-1 monocyte and differentiated THP-1 macrophage-derived EVs. Further, EVs from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (iMSCs) also reduced PA14 biofilm formation to a similar extent as THP-1 EVs, while EVs from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) had a similar effect to its media control.

Our study reveals that sub-lethal pyrethroid exposure triggers systemic increases in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species reducing transmission efficacy of Plasmodium falciparum. Production of reactive nitrogen species in granulocytes induces their proliferation and primes mosquito immunity through activation of a non-canonical immune deficiency (IMD) pathway, leading to increased nitration around the midgut epithelium and subsequent ookinete destruction.

Extant angiosperms use these three TFs and their heterodimer partners to regulate stomatal cell identities. Grasses exhibit a particularly interesting set of duplications and losses of SPCH. Using phylogenetic methods, we tracked the duplication of SPCH to the Poaceae-specific rho whole genome duplication and demonstrated that both paralogs remain under selection. By following responses to environmental change in B. distachyon plants bearing mutations in either BdSPCH1 or BdSPCH2, we reveal paralog-specific divergence in response to light or temperature shifts, and further show this behavior is conserved O. sativa SPCH paralogs. Plausible molecular mechanisms underpinning paralog divergence, and cellular mechanisms driving the stomatal phenotypes are supported by analyses of RNA and protein expression in B. distachyon and sequence variation among grasses.

While factors like visual short-term memory and chronic stress levels can predict responses to stable cognitive effort demands, we do not yet know whether they constrain one's choices of higher effort trials for larger rewards when task demands and potential outcomes shift over time. Here, we examined whether these factors predicted the choice to deploy cognitive effort given increasing effort demands and the tendency to deploy effort given shifting reward availability. Undergraduate participants first performed an online visual short-term memory task to assess capacity for visuospatial short-term memory. They then completed a series of choice trials where they could choose between high-effort, high-reward or low-effort, low-reward trials. In two blocks, we varied either the effort required on high-effort trials or the reward offered on both trial types. We found that visual short-term memory predicted the likelihood of choosing high-effort trials given shifting rewards, while chronic stress and everyday preferences for cognitively effortful strategies predicted the tendency to deploy increasing amounts of effort for a stable reward. Furthermore, participants' subjective reports show a strong focus on attentional processes, and balancing rewards and losses, when making decisions about how much effort to deploy. These findings shed light on distinct trait-level factors associated with cognitive effort choices given shifting demands and outcomes.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

However, its neural basis, and the basis for inter-individual differences in accuracy, remain poorly understood, partly due to limitations in existing assessment tools. Methods: We developed Somatomap 3D, an interactive fMRI-compatible task allowing participants to manipulate a rotatable 3D avatar by adjusting the size and shape of 26 individual body parts to match their perceived body. Twenty-eight healthy male and female adults completed the task during fMRI. Brain activity in a priori regions of interest from previous studies of body processing was modeled using a general linear model incorporating event-specific parameters and parametric modulators related to task performance. Inter-individual differences in body size estimation accuracy were calculated using multidimensional scaling of body part estimation errors, and scores were correlated with BOLD signal eigenvariates from regions of interest. Results: Task engagement was associated with significant activation in hypothesized body-selective and multisensory regions, including bilateral extrastriate body area, right fusiform body area, right superior parietal lobule, and bilateral premotor cortex. Multidimensional scaling identified a primary subdimension reflecting distortions in body part girths, which was significantly associated with neural responses in the superior parietal lobule. No other brain regions showed significant associations with inter-individual differences in estimation accuracy. Conclusions: These results suggest that body size estimation engages a distributed network of visual, motor, and parietal regions. Among these, only the superior parietal lobule showed a significant association with inter-individual variation in body size estimation accuracy for body part girths, supporting its role as a candidate neural substrate for altered body representation in psychiatric conditions such as eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

We mapped individual-specific LPFC networks using resting-state fMRI and tested network-level functional preferences using task fMRI. We found that individual LPFC organization differed markedly from group-average estimates. Individual maps showed more fragmented and interdigitated networks - especially in anterior LPFC - including novel conserved motifs present across individuals.

Detecting subtle annual, seasonal, and spatial variations in tropical forests is challenging, due to their complex structure and dynamic environmental conditions. Traditional processing of hemispherical photographs involves time-consuming pixel classification prone to subjective systematic errors, impeding comparison across months, years, and sites. While automated methods are available, they require coding expertise, which limits their adoption among non-specialists. We present a streamlined protocol that enables automatic, coding-free calculation of LAI by integrating two free software packages: ilastik, for AI-based pixel classification, and CAN-EYE, for LAI estimation. To evaluate its performance, we compared the seasonal and spatial variations in LAI derived from our protocol with those from traditional pixel classification. Four sub-types of tropical forests were used to test the protocols, including moist evergreen forest, semi-deciduous forest, dry forests, and woody savanna. We found that traditional pixel classification (which requires manual threshold adjustments by operators) was influenced by subjective bias, with results varying depending on the time invested in pixel classification. In contrast, the fully automated workflow (our protocol: ilastik pixel classification + CAN-EYE calculation) eliminates subjective bias, enabling consistent cross-years and cross-operator comparisons. Validation using field photos and local forest phenology showed that the automated approach captured seasonal LAI variations more accurately than traditional processing, aligning with observed phenological patterns. However, analyses of spatial variation found no significant difference between protocols, as both captured site-to-site differences with comparable accuracy. Additionally, ilastik can classify pixels into non-binary categories (sky, leaves, and twigs), providing additional detail that is useful for delineating savanna tree phenology.

Engineered deaminases are typically derived from eukaryotic deaminases, which are larger and exhibit high levels of Cas-independent DNA editing, or from evolved variants of the E. coli TadA protein (ecTadA), which are smaller but frequently cause off-base editing. To overcome the limitations inherent to using a single protein sequence as the basis for engineering, we diversified 95 newly identified TadA orthologs by introducing literature-derived mutations and DNA shuffling to yield millions of training sequences for measuring base editor efficiency. Rather than pursuing multiple rounds of random mutagenesis and selection, we trained generative models on the performance data from the diversified pools of variants and drew on information-theoretic insights to efficiently explore the deaminase sequence space to generate diverse and high-performing deaminases. From a single round of diversification, we created a small set of novel and specific cytosine and adenosine deaminases that were markedly distinct in sequence from published base editor deaminases.

Nearly all anaerobic ciliates, ecologically important protists found in diverse oxygen-depleted environments, host methanogenic endosymbionts, sometimes alongside bacterial partners, that facilitate their anaerobic metabolism. Although vertical symbiont transmission necessarily occurs during ciliate cell division, symbionts might occasionally be acquired horizontally.

Here, we present the first intra-specific genomic analysis of both host and symbionts in such partnerships, providing key insights into the fidelity of eukaryotic-prokaryotic liaisons in anoxia. We assessed the symbiont-host co-diversification and genetic variation across eleven populations of a single undescribed Metopus species hosting Methanocorpusculum cultured from intertidal sediment locations separated by meters to 1000s of kilometers. Our results show incongruency in host mitochondrial and symbiont phylogenies, indicating a mixed transmission mode.

RBC invasion is a multi-step process involving several host-parasite interactions, yet the host factors acting during invasion remain underexplored, largely due to the intractability of mature enucleated RBCs. The transmembrane protein CD44 was identified as a host factor for P. falciparum invasion through a forward genetic screen using genetically modified RBCs derived from primary human hematopoietic stem cells. Here, we identify an anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody, BRIC 222, that significantly promotes P. falciparum invasion, and demonstrate that its effect is mediated through CD44 cross-linking. CD44 cross-linking induced changes in the phosphorylation of RBC cytoskeletal proteins, consistent with a proposed role for CD44 as a co-receptor during invasion. CD44 cross-linking also altered the RBC membrane, increasing the accessibility of several surface proteins, including the essential invasion receptor Basigin. The parasite ligand Erythrocyte Binding Antigen-175 (EBA-175), which interacts with CD44, enhanced P. falciparum invasion and induced RBC membrane changes similarly to BRIC 222. Moreover, both BRIC 222 and EBA-175 increased binding of the PfRH5/PCRCR invasion complex to Basigin, an interaction known to be essential for invasion. We propose that CD44 cross-linking, potentially by EBA-175, serves to coordinate and enhance downstream ligand-receptor interactions and to promote signaling to the host cell cytoskeleton, making RBCs more permissive to P. falciparum invasion.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Yet, cifB's rarity can hamper precise quantification, necessitating tissue pooling for reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to achieve reliable measurements, obscuring variation at the level of individual insect tissues. Here, we present four RT digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR) assays to count rare cifA and cifB mRNA from wMel Wolbachia in Drosophila melanogaster. These assays count cif transcripts alongside a synthetic spike-in RNA or a D. melanogaster housekeeping gene to normalize for technical or biological variation. These assays have a limit of detection of about 1 cifA and 3 cifB copies per reaction. We expect these methods to be useful for mosquito-control programs that use wMel to block the spread of pathogens from Aedes aegypti to humans. Moreover, the oligos were designed with homology to cifA and cifB sequences from at least 33 Wolbachia strains, suggesting utility beyond wMel. These methods will allow researchers to measure cif mRNA levels from individual insect tissues, enabling efforts to pair molecular and phenotypic data at unprecedented resolutions.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

In this regarding, it is promising to improve offspring production traits through direct selection on parental individuals with the desirable gut microbiota, and this is termed microbiome breeding. However, the extent of nongenetic maternal transmission of gut microbiota and its post-weaning persistence remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we cross-fostered 120 newborn rabbits that are offspring of 20 does in this study, and compared gut microbiota of all kits at the weaning (35 days of age) and two weeks post-weaning, respectively. Based on variance component analysis, we found that the large proportions of phenotypic variation of four alpha diversity metrics for kits at weaning can be explained by the nursing does, ranging from 0.218 {+/-} 0.106 for Evenness index to 0.464 {+/-} 0.125 for the number of observed features. The significant effect of nursing does was supported further by comparing three beta diversity metrics among different relationships, using Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-hoc comparisons. In contrast, the biological does showed no significant effect on gut microbiota composition of pre-weaning kits. In post-weaning kits, the influence of nursing does on gut microbiota was not obviously decreased, despite there was increasing contributions of additive genetic effects. In conclusion, this study provides direct evidence in rabbits that offspring gut microbiota is predominantly shaped by the nongenetic maternal transmission, with these maternal influences persisting post-weaning. These results indicate the possibility that the direct selection on parental gut microbiota will alter offspring gut microbiota.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Using genome-resolved metagenomics on protozoa enriched rumen fractions; we reveal diverse bacterial genomes exhibiting hallmarks of an obligate intracellular lifestyle. These candidate symbionts span several bacterial phyla and include close relatives of known endosymbionts and parasites of protists as well as previously unclassified or presumed free-living bacterial lineages that likely represent overlooked symbiont specialists.

While certain viral families are common sources of outbreaks, predicting the specific virus within a family that will cause the next outbreak or pandemic is not possible, creating an urgent need for broad spectrum antiviral drugs that are effective against an array of related viral pathogens. However, broad spectrum drug development is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of compound binding sites that are structurally and functionally conserved between viral family members and are essential for virus replication. To overcome this limitation, we developed an in silico approach that combines AI-driven protein structure prediction, computational fragment soaking, multiple sequence alignment, and protein stability calculations to identify highly conserved target sites that are both solvent-accessible and conserved. We applied this approach to the Togaviridae family, which includes emerging pandemic disease threats such as chikungunya and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus for which there are currently no approved antiviral therapies. Our analysis identified multiple solvent accessible and structurally conserved pockets in the alphavirus non-structural protein 2 (nsP2) protease domain, which is essential for processing of the viral replicase proteins. Mutagenesis of key solvent accessible and conserved residues identified novel pockets that are essential for protease activity and the replication of multiple alphaviruses, validating these pockets as potential antiviral target sites for nsP2 inhibitors.

A potential control on bacterioplankton dynamics in these systems is the availability of the essential metabolic cofactor thiamin (vitamin B1) and presence of the allelopathic thiamin antagonist, bacimethrin, that competitively inhibits thiamin-requiring enzymes. We examined dissolved concentrations of thiamin chemical congeners and bacimethrin, 16S-amplicon based microbiome compositions, prokaryotic mRNA-based metatranscriptomes, and reference genomes in hypereutrophic Upper Klamath Basin before and during seasonal cyanoHABs. Our objective was to connect bacterioplankton community compositions and gene expression patterns with thiamin congener and bacimethrin availability under different cyanoHAB conditions. Bacimethrin was present in all samples at nearly equimolar concentrations to the thiamin precursor, HMP, suggesting that similar mechanisms influence the availability of both compounds. Additionally, bacimethrin concentrations were positively correlated with cyanoHAB species abundance (cells mL-1) and the expression of microbial thiamin biosynthesis genes. Samples with high cyanoHAB abundances displayed elevated transcription of genes for thiamin biosynthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and photosynthesis. Bacterioplankton unable to synthesize thiamin and thus vulnerable to bacimethrin allelopathy, such as Limnohabitans spp., showed reduced gene expression when cyanoHAB abundances were high. Reference genomes of cyanoHAB and many picocyanobacteria strains contained complete thiamin biosynthesis gene pathways, implicating these taxa as major thiamin sources. These results suggest that bacimethrin provides a competitive advantage to bacterioplankton that do not require exogenous vitamin B1 by eliminating the risk of bacimethrin uptake with vitamin B1 transporters, potentially facilitating cyanoHAB dominance in Upper Klamath Basin and broader eutrophic watersheds.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

In this study we have split this target duplex to create PAM-proximal and PAM-distal duplex regions, which has allowed us to regulate trans-cleavage activity when these regions are included in combination or separately. These observations on Cas12a activity led to hypotheses into the related functional mechanisms, which we have tested and that have highlighted DNA/protein interactions during Cas12a complex assembly that were not otherwise apparent. Selective destabilization of the nucleic acid complexes appears to drive greater reliance on the Cas12a protein for complex stability.

Therefore, in populations of genetically identical individuals grown in the lab, you would predict that phenotypic heterogeneity would be small. However, we isolated two subpopulations of genetically identical individuals from an exponentially growing batch culture of the microalga Chlamydomonasreinhardtii using Percoll step-gradients. The culture fractionated into a low-density, Top fraction and a high-density, Bottom fraction. These subpopulations displayed several phenotypic differences, including size, protein content, the amount of chlorophyll per cell, and photosynthetic performance. Because of the variation in pigment content and photosynthetic performance, we tested the hypothesis that there are differences in their tolerance to light stress. Following high-light stress, the Bottom subpopulation was more resistant to photodamage, had a greater capacity for light dissipation, and had a minimal photoacclimation response to high light, compared to the Top subpopulation. The Bottom population also had a greater resistance to exogenously induced singlet oxygen stress mediated by rose bengal. We hypothesize that these subpopulations are derived from stochastic mechanism where the Bottom subpopulation has activated a general high-light stress response pathway as part of a \"bet-hedging\" strategy that could give it a fitness advantage with a shift towards a light-stress environment.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Although shikonin biosynthesis has been studied for over 40 years, the steps of naphthalene ring formation are still unknown, as is the reason for the effect of copper. In this study, we explored candidate genes associated with shikonin production using a PCR-select subtraction experiment. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO), a dicopper-dependent oxidoreductase, was highlighted because it showed synchronous expression with shikonin production. Transcriptome analysis of hairy roots and cultured cells of this plant revealed that, of the five PPO genes expressed in L. erythrorhizon, only PPO1 showed a strong correlation with shikonin production. Next, we generated genome-edited hairy roots of LePPO1 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to analyze its impact on shikonin derivative and other specialized metabolite production. The results showed that shikonin content was markedly reduced in all LePPO1-ge lines. Interestingly, the content of deoxyshikonofuran, a hydroquinone derivative and shunt product that branches after GHQ-3''-OH in the shikonin biosynthetic pathway, remained unaffected in the LePPO1-ge lines.

Under chronic stress, however, these adaptive responses become dysfunctional leading to pathological changes in behavior and health. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles essential for cellular energy production and for initiating glucocorticoid synthesis and release from adrenal glands during stress. Thus, mitochondria may represent a first line of response to environmental challenges. However, the effects of chronic stress on mitochondrial function within the HPA axis, particularly regarding sex differences, are unexplored. We exposed adult male and female C57BL6/J mice to four weeks of chronic unpredictable stress and examined behavioral and mitochondrial responses in the hypothalamus and adrenal glands -- two key HPA axis regions. As previous reports indicated sex differences in stress responsivity, we hypothesized that chronic stress would differentially impact mitochondrial respiration within HPA axis regions in a sex-specific manner. Chronic stress increased avoidance behavior in males and passive coping behavior in females, indicating sex-specific behavioral responses. In females, stress significantly decreased mitochondrial respiration in both the hypothalamus and adrenal glands, while males were not significantly affected. In males, stress increased adrenal expression of mitochondrial complex II protein, which may have served a compensatory role to preserve mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial respiration significantly correlated with behavioral measures in stressed animals, highlighting a relationship between metabolism and stress-induced impairments. These findings reveal sex-specific metabolic adaptations to chronic stress and suggest that females may be more vulnerable to stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction within the HPA axis.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping has revolutionized crop improvement by enabling high-resolution genomic analyses and accelerating breeding programs. In soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), a globally important legume crop, existing genotyping data for 180,961 SNP markers from the Korean soybean core collection were generated using the outdated Williams 82 reference genome version 1 (Wm82.v1), which contains numerous assembly gaps and misassemblies that limit genomic resolution. While high-quality reference genomes including Wm82.v4 and Wm82.v6 (telomere-to-telomere assembly) are now available, the valuable existing SNP array data have not been integrated with these improved genomic resources. Here we show successful remapping of the 180K SNP array data to both Wm82.v4 and Wm82.v6 reference genomes through sequence-based alignment of flanking regions. We extracted flanking sequences from SNP marker positions in Wm82.v1 and mapped them to the newer reference versions based on sequence similarity, excluding markers with mapping failures, allele mismatches, low-identity alignments, or multiple mappings, which resulted in successful mapping of 175,202 and 175,763 markers to Wm82.v4 and Wm82.v6, respectively. We also remapped genotype data from 927 soybean accessions (497 USDA-GRIN accessions and 430 Korean core collection accessions) to both reference versions. This updated SNP dataset provides the soybean research community with a comprehensive genomic resource that leverages both existing genotyping investments and state-of-the-art reference genome assemblies for enhanced crop improvement and genomic studies.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Advances in technology have decreased the cost of generating genetic variation data from ancient people, resulting in exponentially increasing numbers of individuals with whole genome data. However, each technology comes with platform-specific biases, limiting co-analyzability of individuals sequenced with different technologies as well as joint analysis of modern and ancient individuals. We present a method to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minimal technology-specific bias. Leveraging data from over 17,000 ancient individuals, we apply this method to identify a set of more than a million SNPs that we call the \"Compatibility\" panel, and which has been effectively assayed in a large fraction of ancient human DNA experiments published to date. We also identify a subset of these SNPs, the \"Compatibility-HO\" panel, which further restricts to positions that have been assayed in more than ten thousand modern individuals from more than a thousand diverse populations using the Affymetrix Human Origins (HO) genotyping array. The Compatibility panel reduces spurious Z-scores due to different sequencing platforms by nearly an order of magnitude, while retaining around 70-90% of statistical power for f-statistic analysis.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "The rapid emergence of viruses with pandemic potential continues to pose a threat to public health worldwide. With the typical drug discovery pipeline taking an average of 5-10 years to reach clinical readiness, there is an urgent need for strategies to develop broad-spectrum antivirals that can target multiple viral family members and variants of concern. We present a structure-based computational pipeline designed to identify and evaluate broad-spectrum inhibitors across viral family members for a given target in order to support spectrum breadth assessment and prioritization in lead optimization programs. This pipeline comprises three key steps: (1) an automated search to identify viral sequences related to a specified target construct, (2) pose prediction leveraging any available structural data, and (3) scoring of protein-ligand complexes to estimate antiviral activity breadth. The pipeline is implemented using the <code>drugforge</code> package: an open-source toolkit for structure-based antiviral discovery. To validate this framework, we retrospectively evaluated two overlapping datasets of ligands bound to the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV main protease (Mpro), observing useful predictive power with respect to experimental binding affinities. Additionally, we screened known SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors against a panel of human and non-human coronaviruses, demonstrating the potential of this approach to assess broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Our computational strategy aims to accelerate the identification of antiviral therapies for current and emerging viruses with pandemic potential, contributing to global preparedness for future outbreaks.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Gene signatures characterizing driver mutations in lung squamous carcinoma are predictive of the progression of pre-cancer lesions", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.29.664792", "authors": "Lin, Y.; Mekala, V.; Li, J.-r.; Wang, X.; Wu, J.; Aminu, M.; Zhang, J.; Ripley, R. T.; Amos, C. I.; Cheng, C.", "abstract": "Patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are often diagnosed at advanced stages, limiting opportunities for early intervention. LUSC develops through a multistep progression from low-grade lesions to high-grade lesions, including carcinoma in situ (CIS), of which approximately half progress to invasive cancer while the other half regress. Although frequent mutations and copy number alterations have been documented in LUSC and observed in precursor lesions, their prognostic significance in precancerous stages remains largely unexplored. In this study, we leveraged gene expression data from LUSC tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to derive transcriptional signatures corresponding to 34 key driver genomic aberrations, including mutations, amplifications, and deletions. These tumor-derived gene signatures were then applied to precancerous lesion datasets to assess their ability to characterize developmental stages and predict progression risk. We found that many of these signatures increased progressively across lesion stages, reflecting their roles in early tumorigenesis. In particular, several signatures accurately predicted which CIS lesions would progress to invasive cancer. Furthermore, these signature scores were more strongly associated with patient prognosis in LUSC than the presence of genomic aberrations alone. We also examined the relationship between driver-associated signatures and the tumor immune microenvironment. Signature scores were significantly correlated with immune features such as immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, including CD274 (PD-L1). Interestingly, these associations varied across lesion stages, indicating dynamic immune interactions during cancer evolution. Together, our findings demonstrate that tumor-derived driver gene expression signatures provide valuable insight into the biology and progression risk of precancerous lesions, offering potential utility for early detection and intervention strategies in LUSC.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

H.; Sando, R.", "abstract": "Neural circuits contain a diverse array of inhibitory interneurons that control information processing. The cell surface receptors and signaling pathways that modulate cell type specific inhibitory synaptic function are unclear. Here, we identify the atypical adhesion GPCR ADGRA1 as essential for hippocampal PV and SST inhibitory synaptic function. ADGRA1 is selectively enriched in hippocampal PV and SST interneurons and localizes to a subset of synapses. ADGRA1 deletion in PV and SST interneurons impairs inhibitory synaptic inputs onto Dentate Gyrus granule cells and generates deficits in learning and memory. ADGRA1 engages several downstream G proteins, notably G13, a pathway important for the establishment of hippocampal PV interneuron synaptic networks. These results identify an orphan receptor pathway selective for specific inhibitory synapse subtypes and expand our understanding of the signaling mechanisms that establish hippocampal inhibitory circuits.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

L.; Shin, J. H.; Shahid, F.; Malone, T.; Ma, Y.; Vasu, S. O.; Tien, N.-W.; Cekada, K.; Anderson, L.; Chandra, S.; Fiete, I.; Alvarez, V. A.; Gu, Y.", "abstract": "Animals construct internal \"cognitive maps\" of the world during navigation in spatial and non-spatial domains, with grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) playing a key role. This requires associating internal position estimates with external cues to reduce spatial uncertainty over time. However, how grid cell representations evolve in novel spaces to support map formation is unclear. To address this question, we longitudinally record grid cells with two-photon calcium imaging over 10 days as mice learn operant tasks in novel virtual linear tracks. We observe that spatial tuning of grid cells is present immediately in novel tracks but evolves as a significant fraction of spatial fields shift backward on a run-by-run basis, within and across days. Backward shifts are more prevalent and persistent in successful learners. The fields gradually stabilize across days, anchored by landmarks, suggesting a slow plasticity mechanism that results in an increasingly fragmented and stable map. The backward shifts partially reset daily, reflecting a slower consolidation timescale. We show that though individual fields of a cell shift differentially, co-active fields of co-modular grid cells shift together, indicating their coupled dynamics keep them on the same two-dimensional torus during this plastic period. Next, we build a simple entorhinal-hippocampal model that explains the diverse phenomena-grid field shifts, fragmentation, and increasing fidelity of the spatial map-and predicts slow Hebbian plasticity in the return hippocampal-to-entorhinal pathway. Finally, using ex vivo slice electrophysiology, we show that plasticity in an indirect hippocampus-to-MEC pathway correlates with spatial learning performance and could account for the hypothesized slow plasticity of the model. Together, our study provides multifaceted evidence of slow plasticity in synapses from the hippocampus to the MEC, elucidating the formation of stable and fragmented maps that combine internal and cue-driven positional estimates in rich environments, elucidating cognitive map formation during spatial learning.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}

Australian native possums are a major wildlife reservoir and infected possums shed M. ulcerans in their excreta, with mosquitoes being the major transmitting vector in this region. BU is geographically restricted and this feature, combined with an average 4.8-month incubation period, makes tracking M. ulcerans environmental spread and timely identification of new BU endemic areas challenging. While human movement complicates transmission tracing, we used the highly territorial behaviour of native possums and high-resolution pathogen genomics to confidently identify new BU endemic areas in Melbourne's inner northwest and southern suburbs of Geelong. Using pathogen genomic phylodynamic modelling, we estimated that M. ulcerans was introduced to these areas 2-6 years before the emergence of human BU cases. This study shows how possum excreta surveys combined with pathogen genome data can pinpoint new BU endemic areas, thus providing critical local knowledge for targeted public health interventions to reduce exposure risk and ensure early diagnosis.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": ""}
