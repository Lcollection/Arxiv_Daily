Supplementing INAM into growth media promotes the replicative lifespan (RLS) of this single cell organism by maintaining intracellular NAD+ homeostasis. INAM also extends yeast chronological lifespan (CLS), but the underlying mechanisms remain largely uncharacterized. To identify interacting genes, a chemical genomics screen of the yeast knockout (YKO) collection was performed for mutants sensitized to growth inhibition by INAM. Significant Gene Ontology (GO) terms included transcription elongation factors, metabolic pathways converging on one-carbon metabolism, and de novo purine biosynthesis, collectively suggesting that INAM may perturb nucleotide metabolism. Indeed, INAM caused dose-dependent depletion of intracellular cytidine, uridine and guanosine, ribonucleosides derived from the breakdown of nucleotide monophosphates by a set of nucleotidases (Phm8, Sdt1, Isn1) or the alkaline phosphatase Pho8. Direct inhibition of recombinant Sdt1 and Phm8 nucleotidase activity by INAM was confirmed in vitro, as was inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity. Each of these enzymes can also convert nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) to nicotinamide riboside (NR), consistent with an accumulation of NMN and NAD+ upon inhibition by INAM. Taken together, the findings suggest a model whereby partial impairment of nucleotide salvage pathways can trigger a hormetic stress response that supports enhanced quiescence during chronological aging.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We profiled inducible genetic CRC mouse models that recapitulate key features of human CRC, assigned cell types and epithelial expression programs to spatial tissue locations in tumors, and computationally used them to identify the regional features spanning different cells in the same spatial niche. We find that tumors were organized in cellular neighborhoods, each with a distinct composition of cell subtypes, expression programs, and local cellular interactions.

Effective conservation strategies require appropriate monitoring approaches, including efficient and scalable survey methods. In this study, we developed a large-scale monitoring method for herons and egrets (Ardeidae) using vehicle-mounted video cameras and distance sampling models that incorporate location uncertainty. The survey was conducted in and around the evacuation zone of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. A total of 7,031 km of roadside video footage was recorded, covering 24.41 km{superscript 2} of farmland. Ardeidae were observed only outside the evacuation zone and were entirely absent within it. Predicted abundance differed greatly between areas inside (0.0279 {+/-} 0.0307/km{superscript 2}) and outside (4.57 {+/-} 5.36/km{superscript 2}) the evacuation zone. Incorporating location uncertainty into the distance sampling model had little effect on the estimates (4.57 {+/-} 5.36 vs. 4.51 {+/-} 5.29/km{superscript 2} with and without integrating location uncertainty, respectively). This suggests that our video-based roadside survey method is robust to location uncertainty in structured landscapes such as Japanese rice paddies.

Spectral phenotypes were collected under standardized illumination and observation conditions from the same top-of-canopy leaves used for nuclear DNA extraction. We found that spectral and environmental information accounted for 77% of the variance along the first two principal coordinates representing genetic structure among sampled individuals, where spectral phenotypes contributed 12% to the prediction of genetic structure.

L.; Tang, J.; Xie, Y.", "abstract": "Motivation: Fluorescent microscopy imaging is vital to capturing single-cell spatial data, characterizing tissue organization and facilitating comprehensive analysis of cellular state. Advancements in fluorescent microscopy imaging technologies have enabled precise downstream cellular analysis, particularly in cell segmentation. Accurate segmentation of individual cells allows better profiling and understanding of cell properties and behaviors. The majority of existing segmentation methods predominantly concentrate on enhancing segmentation algorithms, and their effectiveness strongly relies on the input stained image quality. Factors such as high cellular density, indistinct cell boundaries, and staining artifacts can result in uneven and low-quality staining, particularly causing missing or unclear membrane staining. These artifacts adversely impact the efficacy of the subsequent cell segmentation methods.Results: To tackle this insufficient membrane staining, we propose a novel approach, MEM-GAN, to generate high-quality membranes for cells with missing or weak membranes. Inspired by advanced style transfer techniques in computer vision, MEM-GAN styles the content of the cells with missing or weak membranes into cells with integrated membrane staining. Considering the differences in membrane morphology between epithelial/tumor cells and immune cells, MEM-GAN deals with tumor and immune cells separately, not only enhancing membrane staining for cells with partially weak membrane signals but also generating membranes for cells with only nuclear channels. The proposed MEM-GAN is evaluated using the publicly available CosMx dataset. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in image staining quality, more accurate representation of membrane morphology characteristics, and better performance in downstream segmentation tasks. MEM-GAN is flexibly adapted and applied to other spatially resolved transcriptomics datasets, such as MERFISH and FISHseq. Our work provides a new perspective on tackling the challenges in cell segmentation from fluorescent microscopy image restoration.

I.", "abstract": "Rates of molecular, phenotypic, and lineage diversification typically scale negatively with time interval of measurement, raising longstanding questions about time-dependency of evolutionary processes. These patterns and their potential meaning have recently re-entered evolutionary discussions. In this Perspective we revisit the general challenges in interpreting rate-time relationships. Much apparent temporal scaling of evolutionary rate is an inescapable outcome of plotting a ratio against its denominator, either directly or indirectly. Highly unlikely relationships between timescale and accumulated evolutionary change are required to produce anything other than negative rate-time relationships. Simulations reveal that constant rate evolutionary processes readily generate negative rate-time scaling relationships under many conditions, and that a range of rate-time scaling exponents can be generated by similar evolutionary processes. Reanalysis of six empirical datasets reveals unscaled magnitudes of evolution that are either unrelated to time and/or vary in their relationship with time, with over 99% of variation in rate-time relationships across six datasets explained by time variation alone. We further evaluated a recent hypothesis that evolutionary rate-time scaling reflects three modes of change, from micro- to macroevolutionary time scales using break-point regression, but we found no strong support for this hypothesis. Taken together, negative rate-time relationships are largely inevitable and difficult to interpret. In contrast, it is more straightforward to assess how evolutionary change accumulates with time.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

G.; Fletcher, D.", "abstract": "Spatially explicit capture-recapture models are used widely to estimate the density of animal populations. The population is represented by an inhomogeneous Poisson point process, where each point is the activity centre of an individual and density corresponds to the intensity surface. Estimates of density that assume a homogeneous model ( average density) are robust to unmodelled inhomogeneity, and the coverage of confidence intervals is good when the intensity surface does not change, even if it is quite uneven. However, coverage is poor when the intensity surface differs among realisations. Practical examples include populations with dynamic social aggregation, and the population in a region sampled using small detector arrays. Poor coverage results from overdispersion of the number of detected individuals; the number is Poisson when the intensity surface is static, but stochasticity leads to extra-Poisson variation.\n\nWe investigated overdispersion from three point processes with a stochastic intensity surface (Thomas cluster process, random habitat mosaic and log-Gaussian Cox process). A previously proposed correction for overdispersion performed poorly. The problem is lessened by assuming population size to be fixed, but this assumption cannot be justified for common study designs. Rigorous correction for spatial overdispersion requires either prior knowledge of the generating process or replicated and representative sampling. When the generating process is known, variation in a new scalar measure of local density predicts overdispersion. Otherwise, overdispersion may be estimated empirically from the numbers detected on independent detector arrays.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether and how a localised deformation of the cell surface gives rise to transient intracellular flows spanning several microns and lasting seconds. Next, we show that pressure gradients induced in the cytoplasm can be sustained over several minutes. We found that stable pressure gradients can arise from the combination of cytoplasmic poroelasticity and water flows across the membrane.

This self- knowledge about ones own perceptual capacities provides a quasi-objective ground truth as to whether two stimuli  should be judged as similar. To test this idea, we measured perceptual discrimination capacity between face pairs, and asked subjects to rank the similarity between them.

O.", "abstract": "Models of forest dynamics are an important tool to understand and predict forest responses to global change. Despite recent model development, predictions of forest dynamics under global change remain highly variable reflecting uncertainty in future conditions, forest demographic processes, and the data used to parameterize and validate models. Quantifying this uncertainty and accounting for it when making adaptive management decisions is critical to our ability to conserve forest ecosystems in the face of rapidly changing conditions. Dynamical spatio-temporal models (DSTMs) are a particularly powerful tool in this setting given they quantify uncertainty associated with process-based models of forest demography, the parameters upon which those models depend, and the forest data used to inform them. Further, DSTMs propa-gate this uncertainty to predictions of forest dynamics allowing for its formal integration within adaptive management decision frameworks. A major challenge to the application of DSTMs in applied forest ecology has been the lack of a scalable, theoretical model of forest dynamics that generates predictions at the stand level--the scale at which management decisions are made. We address this challenge by integrating a matrix projection model motivated by the McKendrick-von Foerster partial differential equation for size-structured population dynamics within a Bayesian hierarchical DSTM informed by forest inventory data. The model provides probabilistic predictions of species-specific demographic rates and changes in the size-species distribution over time. The model is applied to predict long-term dynamics (60+ years) within the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Maine, USA, accounting for uncertainty in inventory observations, process-based predictions, and model parameters for nine Acadian Forest species. We find that variability in inventory observations associated with heterogeneous stand conditions drives uncertainty in predictions of forest dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of how the initial DSTM can be refined and extended to better represent forest dynamics under global change and inform adaptive management.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

PCM nucleates microtubules that help position and segregate chromosomes during mitosis, yet how PCM resists microtubule-mediated forces is poorly understood at the material level. Here, we show that PLK-1 phosphorylation of SPD-5 tunes the dynamics and material properties of the PCM scaffold in C. elegans embryos. Microrheology of reconstituted PCM condensates reveals that PLK-1 phosphorylation decreases SPD-5 dynamics and increases condensate viscoelasticity. Similarly, in embryos, phospho-mimetic SPD-5 is less dynamic than wild-type SPD-5, which itself is less dynamic than phospho-null SPD-5. PCM built with phospho-null SPD-5 is smaller than normal, but its assembly can be partially rescued by reducing microtubule-dependent forces. The same is true for PCM built with phospho-mimetic SPD-5, yet the underlying causes are distinct: under force, phospho-null SPD-5 fails to assemble, while phospho-mimetic SPD-5 forms hyper-stable foci that fail to cohere into a uniform, spherical mass. Both mutants have defects with chromosome segregation and viability. Thus, tuning of SPD-5 phosphorylation optimizes PCM material properties to achieve correct PCM size, integrity, and function.

The optical extinction of residual floating AuNPs is digitized using a customized circuitry incorporating inexpensive optoelectronic elements and feedback mechanisms for stabilized readout. Uniquely, NasRED introduces active fluidic forces through engineered centrifugation and vortex agitation, effectively promoting protein detection at low concentrations and accelerating signal generation.

To characterize this process, six porcine tissues/tissue layers (artery, breast, dermis, epidermis, muscle and nerve) were independently decellularized via chemical, mechanical and enzymatic processes and the resulting dECMs formulated into biocompatible inks, to serve as source biomaterials for 3D printing.

We describe and evaluate a new iterative method of statistical inference about model parameters, which revisits the idea of inferring a likelihood surface using simulation when the likelihood function cannot be evaluated. In addition to the traditional assessment of precision in terms of bias and mean square error, we also evaluate the coverage of confidence intervals. It is based on combining the random forest machine learning method, and multivariate Gaussian mixture (MGM) models, in an effective inference workflow, here used to fit models with up to 15 variable parameters. Masked autoregressive flows, a deep learning technique, is also tested as an alternative to MGM models. The method is compared to that of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) with random forests, with which it shares some technical features, on scenarios of inference of historical demography from population genetic data. These comparisons highlight the importance of an iterative workflow for exploring the parameter space efficiently. For equivalent simulation effort of the data-generating process, the new summary-likelihood method provides intervals whose coverage is better controlled than the marginal coverage of intervals provided by ABC with random forests, and than generally reported for ABC methods. The iterative workflow can also yield greater improvements in estimator precision when larger datasets are used.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We then demonstrate that--in both social and nonsocial contexts--in vivo PVNOT calcium dynamics align with transitions from rest to thermogenesis and behavioral arousal. Using a computer vision model to track thermoeffector pathways, we demonstrate that precisely timed stimulation of PVNOT during low-Tb resting states increases thermogenesis and behavioral arousal.

M.; Florentin, A.", "abstract": "The apicoplast of Plasmodium parasites serves as a metabolic hub that synthesize essential biomolecules. Like other endosymbiotic organelles, 90% of the apicoplast proteome is encoded by the cell nucleus and transported to the organelle. Evidence suggests that the apicoplast has minimal control over the synthesis of its proteome and therefore it is unclear how organelle proteostasis is regulated. Here, we identified and investigated a large and conserved chaperonin (CPN) complex with a previously unknown function. Using genetic tools, we demonstrated that ablation of the apicoplast CPN60 subunit leads to parasite death due to organellar damage, immediately within its first replication cycle, deviating from the delayed death phenotype commonly observed for apicoplast translation inhibitors. Unlike its close orthologues in other prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, CPN60 is not upregulated during heat shock (HS) and does not affect HS response in the parasite. Instead, we found that it is directly involved in proteostasis through interaction with the Clp (caseinolytic protease) proteolytic complex. We showed that CPN60 physically binds both the active and inactive forms of the Clp complex, and manipulates its stability. A computational structural model of a possible interaction between these two large complexes suggests a stable interface. Finally, we screened a panel of inhibitors for the bacterial CPN60 orthologue GroEL, to test the potential of chaperonin inhibition as antimalarial. These inhibitors demonstrated an anti-Plasmodium activity that was not restricted to apicoplast function, with additional targets outsides of this organelle. Taken together, this work reveals how balanced activities of proteolysis and refolding safeguard the apicoplast proteome, and is essential for organelle biogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe cell of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has a unique organelle called the apicoplast that produces essential metabolites, but it is unclear how it maintains a stable proteome. Here, we address the question of organelle proteostasis by investigating the function of a large chaperonin complex and its main subunit CPN60. We show that CPN60 mutants die due to organellar damage immediately within the first replication cycle, avoiding the typical apicoplast-delayed cell death. We demonstrate that it binds and stabilizes another large proteolytic complex and use computational predicting tools to demonstrate how a stable interface is attained. We use bacterial inhibitors to explore their potential as an antimalarial drug target. This study reveals how balanced refolding and proteolysis safeguard the apicoplast proteome and opens a new avenue for antimalarial drug discovery.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

S.; Grazul, J. L.; Baird, B.", "abstract": "Similar to T cells and B cells, mast cell surfaces are dominated by microvilli, and like these other immune cells we showed with microvillar cartography (MVC) that key signaling proteins for RBL mast cells localize to these topographical features. Although stabilization of ordered lipid nanodomains around antigen-crosslinked IgE-Fc{varepsilon}RI is known to facilitate necessary coupling with Lyn tyrosine kinase to initiate transmembrane signaling in these mast cells, the relationship of ordered-lipid nanodomains to membrane topography had not been determined. With nanoscale resolution provided by MVC, SEM and co-localization probability (CP) analysis, we found that Fc{varepsilon}RI and Lyn kinase are positioned primarily on the microvilli of resting mast cells in separate nano-assemblies. Upon antigen-activation, Fc{varepsilon}RI and Lyn merge into overlapping populations together with the LAT scaffold protein, accompanied by merger of microvilli into ridge-like ruffles. With selective lipid probes, we further found that ordered-lipid nanodomains preferentially occupy microvillar membranes, contrasting with localization of disordered lipids to flatter regions. With this proximity of signaling proteins and ordered lipid nanodomains in microvilli, the mast cells are poised to respond sensitively and efficiently to antigen but only in the presence of this stimulus. Use of a short chain ceramide to disrupt ordered-lipid regions of the plasma membrane and evaluation with MVC, CP, and flow cytometry provided strong evidence that the microvillar selective localization of signaling proteins and membrane environments is facilitated by the interplay between ordered-lipid nanodomains and actin attachment proteins, ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) and cofilin.\n\nSignificance StatementParticipation of ordered-lipid nanodomains (aka \"rafts\") to target immune signaling in the plasma membrane has been established. Separately, membrane topography, specifically microvilli, has also emerged as a participant. Here, we show how these features are coordinated in mast cells that serve as gatekeepers for antigen-triggered, receptor-mediated immune responses, including allergies and inflammation. We found that these specific antigen receptors and a key kinase, together with ordered-lipid nanodomains, localize to microvilli in resting cells, forming separated nano-assemblies. Antigen causes the merger of microvilli into ruffles where receptors and kinases couple to initiate transmembrane signaling. Selective pre-organization of signaling proteins and targeting lipid domains in microvilli and their coordinated redistribution upon antigen stimulation facilitates sensitive and efficient immune responses.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Using acoustic sampling and field observation, we studied bird species found in MSF in the Eastern Himalayas. Our results show differential vocal activity patterns among MSF-forming bird species and suggest a positive correlation between calling rates and closeness centrality in understory MSFs.

J.; Fowler, A.", "abstract": "Insights gained through interpretation of models trained on the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire contribute to advances in understanding of immune-mediated disease. This has the potential to improve diagnostic tests and treatments, particularly for autoimmune diseases. However, TCR repertoire datasets with samples from donors of known autoimmune disease status generally include orders of magnitude fewer samples than TCR sequences. Promising TCR repertoire classification approaches consider relationships between non-identical TCR sequences. In particular, kmer methods demonstrate strong and stable performance for small datasets. We propose a TCR repertoire representation that considers the relationships between amino acids within kmers flexibly and efficiently, which makes exploration of a wide range of TCR sequence features feasible. XGBoost models are trained and tested on kmer representations of TCR repertoire datasets including samples from patients with coeliac disease as well as donors with previous cytomegalovirus infection. We show that kmers that use small representative alphabets of amino acids are capable of training models that perform similarly or better than kmers based on all 20 amino acids. We find that, for cytomegalovirus infection status classification, defining amino acid relationships using BLOSUM62 can lead to a model with stronger performance as compared to an Atchley factor definition. Finally, we detail kmers or motifs which are important in each classification model and highlight the challenge of training truly interpretable TCR repertoire classification models which, if overcome, could lead to biomarker discovery for autoimmune diseases.\n\nAuthor summaryTCR repertoire classification models can provide valuable understanding of autoimmune diseases if they can accurately infer autoimmune disease status and are biologically interpretable. Based on a kmer representation of the TCR repertoire, which has been shown to be most appropriate to train classification models on smaller datasets, we develop a computationally efficient method of grouping amino acid sequences to add knowledge to immune status classification model inputs, and consider its effect on interpretability. We find that most of the 4mer-based feature types we tested perform well in combination with an XGBoost model, where some benefit may be gained by applying a greatly-reduced alphabet of amino acids based on BLOSUM62 for cytomegalovirus serostatus classification. Our proposed reduced alphabet methodology is an alternative to kmer clustering which allows more efficient exploration of amino acid relationships and results in a more interpretable feature space.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We measured how sites in these 3 cortical areas responded to variation in both dimensions. Contrast modulated responses in all areas. In V2 and V4, the presence of naturalistic structure both modulated responses and increased contrast sensitivity.

These events are associated with trained immunity and have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

The persistence of a chronic yet sub-threshold inflammation across the periphery and the brain is well documented in the patients and animal models of these disorders and can be investigated for augmenting pharmacotherapy. IL1{beta}, a pleiotropic cytokine and a key regulator of neuroinflammation has been of particular interest in this regard. Previous studies on rodent models of anxiogenic stress show activation of a large multiprotein complex - the NLRP3 inflammasome, which increases IL1{beta} production facilitated by caspase 1, through what is considered a canonical inflammasome activation pathway. However, there exists a second non canonical inflammasome activation pathway whose impact on IL1{beta} release, inflammation and behavioral consequences remain unclear. Using rat models of physical and psychosocial stress, we observed stress-induced sex-specific upregulation of activated caspase 11 and gasdermin D N-terminal fragments, the mediators of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway that facilitates IL1{beta} release through pore formations in the plasma membrane. This is the first report of non-canonical inflammasome pathway being activated in the brain and peripheral immune cells in response to psychosocial stress. Inhibition of caspase 11 with wedelolactone, or Gasdermin D cleavage with Disulfiram reduced stress-induced elevation of IL1{beta} levels, anxiety and fear acquisition, facilitated fear extinction and recall, and improved working memory. Combination treatments targeting both canonical (ibrutinib for pBTK/NLRP3 or MCC950 for NLRP3 inhibition) and non-canonical (wedelolactone for caspase 11 or disulfiram for gasdermin D) pathways proved more efficacious in reducing stress-mediated neuroinflammation, dendritic spine elimination in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and behavioral dysfunction. Furthermore, psychosocial stress drove peripheral inflammation, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which was mitigated by the combination treatment. Taken together, this study reveals a novel mechanism underlying psychosocial stress involving both canonical and non-canonical inflammasome signaling to facilitate IL1{beta} induction and behavioral changes.

This study charts evolutionary rescue -- where rapid adaptation prevents extinction -- in flour beetles, across 70 generations. Using >10,000 census points and measuring fitness in ancestors, their first-generation offspring and in the evolved lines, we show that larval development rate is the strongest correlate of long-term population success across diverse wild-collected populations.

Here, we introduce PERADIGM (Phenotype Embedding similarity-based RAre DIsease Gene Mapping), a novel framework that leverages natural language processing techniques to integrate comprehensive phenotype information from electronic health records for rare disease gene discovery. PERADIGM employs an embedding model to capture relationships between ICD-10 codes, providing a nuanced representation of individual phenotypes. By utilizing patient similarity scores, it enhances the identification of candidate genes associated with disease-specific phenotypes, surpassing conventional methods that rely on binary disease status. We applied PERADIGM to the UK Biobank dataset for three rare diseases: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). PERADIGM identified additional candidate genes associated with ADPKD-related and Marfan syndrome-related phenotypes, some of which are supported by existing literature, and demonstrated enhanced signal detection for NF1-specific phenotypes beyond traditional methods. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PERADIGM to identify genes associated with rare diseases and related phenotypes by incorporating phenotype embeddings and patient similarity, providing a powerful tool for precision medicine and a deeper understanding of rare disease genetics and clinical manifestations.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Atypical brain activation patterns have been linked to working memory difficulties in individuals with NF1. The present work investigates if NF1 has increased inhibitory activity in the frontoparietal network during working memory tasks compared to neurotypical controls. Forty-three adolescents with NF1 and twenty-six age-matched neurotypical controls completed functional magnetic resonance imaging scans during a verbal working memory task. Dynamic causal models (DCMs) were estimated for bilateral frontoparietal network (dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC and vlPFC), superior and inferior parietal gyri (SPG and IPG)). The parametric empirical Bayes approach with Bayesian model reduction was used to test the hypothesis that NF1 diagnosis would be characterised by greater inhibitory self-connections (intrinsic connectivity). Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was performed to test the generalisability of group differences. NF1 participants demonstrated greater average intrinsic connectivity of left dlPFC, IPG, SPG and bilateral vlPFC. The DCM that best explained effects of working memory showed that NF1 group has increased intrinsic connectivity of left vlPFC, but weaker intrinsic connectivity of right vlPFC and left dlPFC. The parameters of these connections showed a modest but positive predictive correlation of r = 0.19 (p = 0.055) with diagnosis status, suggesting a trend toward predictive value. Overall, increased average intrinsic connectivity of left dlPFC, IPG, SPG and bilateral vlPFC in NF1, suggests reduced overall sensitivity of these regions to inputs. Working memory evoked different patterns of input processing in NF1, that cannot be characterised by increased inhibition alone. Instead, modulatory connectivity related to working memory showed less inhibitory self-connectivity of left dlPFC and left vlPFC, and more inhibitory intrinsic connectivity of right vlPFC in NF1. This discrepancy between average and modulatory connectivity suggests that overall NF1 participants are responsive to cognitive task-related inputs but may show atypical adaptation to the task demands of working memory.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

The population activity of grid cells serves as an allocentric representation of the current location of the animal. Recent studies have identified a class of grid cells that represent locations ahead of the animal. How do these predictive representations emerge from the wetware of the MEC? To address this question, we developed a detailed conductance-based model of the MEC network, constrained by existing data on the biophysical properties of stellate cells and the topology of the MEC network. Our model revealed two mechanisms underlying the emergence of a predictive code in the MEC. The first relied on a time scale associated with the HCN conductance. The other depended on the degree of asymmetry in the topology of the MEC network. The former mechanism was sufficient to explain predictive coding in layer II grid cells that represented locations shifted ahead of the current location. The shift was equivalent to [~]5% of the diameter of a grid field. The latter mechanism was required to model predictive representations in layer III grid cells that were shifted forward by a distance of [~]25% of the diameter of a grid field. A corollary of our model, that the extent of the predictive code changes monotonically along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC following observed changes in the properties of the HCN conductance, is borne out by recent experiments.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "High levels of L- and D-2-hydroxyglutarate, the reduced forms of -ketoglutarate (KG), are implicated in human neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Both enantiomers exert effects on epigenetics by modulating a family of KG-dependent dioxygenases involved in histone, DNA and RNA demethylation. L-2HG dehydrogenase (L2HGDH) converts L-2HG to KG. Its deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism (IEM) characterized by systemic elevations of L-2HG, progressive neurological disability and a high risk of malignancy in the brain. The mechanisms behind these aberrations are unknown. Here we used an isogenic, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) system to study the impact of L2HGDH deficiency on neural progenitor cell (NPC) function and neuronal differentiation. We demonstrate that L2HGDH deficiency causes accumulation of L-2HG, NPC hyperproliferation, increased clonogenicity, excessive growth, and defective neuronal differentiation in 2D cultures and cortical spheroids. Editing the L2HGDH locus to wild-type reverses these effects. Blocking L-2HG accumulation in NPCs with a glutaminase inhibitor also induces neuronal differentiation. L-2HG-dependent inhibition of KDM5 histone demethylases leads to widespread retention of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, markers of active gene expression. These marks are prominently elevated at the MYC locus in L2HGDH-deficient cells, and consequently cells express high MYC both in 2D culture and in many distinct cell types within cortical spheroids. Although thousands of loci display altered histone methylation, genetically or pharmacologically normalizing MYC is sufficient to completely reverse defective neuronal differentiation. These data indicate that the primary metabolic disturbance in an iPSC IEM model activates the MYC oncogene, favoring stem cell self-renewal and suppressing lineage commitment to neurons.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

H1 loss is essential to establish pluripotency in animal PGCs but its role is not known in plants. Here, we identified two regulatory pathways involving a citrullinase and an E3-ubiquitin ligase that contribute H1.1 loss in female SMC in Arabidopsis. We also identified roles for two specific residues: an arginine, whose positive charge contributes to H1.1 destabilization from chromatin, and a lysine in the globular domain that is essential for H1.1 degradation. Ovules with impaired H1.1 loss in the SMC proceed through sporogenesis but fail to complete gametogenesis.

The prevalence and abundance of known B-vitamin producers and B-vitamin biosynthesis pathways have already been reported in gut microbiome cohorts of a few countries including India. Objective: To test whether the presence of B-vitamin producers/biosynthetic pathways translates into serum B-vitamin levels, taking B12 as a case example. Methods: Fecal samples were collected from non-deficient (serum B12 level > 210 pg/mL, n=29) and B12 deficient (serum B12 level < 210 pg/mL, n=30) children from a tribal region of central India. Whole metagenomic DNA was extracted, sequenced, and analyzed for taxonomic profiling and diversity comparisons. Differentially abundant taxa between two groups were identified. The prevalence and abundance of potential B12 producers were compared, and their association with serum B12 level was established. Results: A comparison of within-sample diversity between the two groups did not show any difference; however, between-sample diversity was significantly less in the B12 deficient group. Differential abundance testing also showed different microbiome structure in the B12 deficient group, where an increased abundance of B12 transporter-carrying Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a few pathogenic species, and ten known B12 producers was observed. Potential B12 producers were also significantly prevalent and abundant in the deficient group. Their cumulative abundance was also significantly higher in the deficient group and showed a negative association with serum B12 levels. Conclusion: A higher abundance of potential B12 producers in the deficient group suggested an adaptive mechanism by the gut microbiome to meet the B12 requirements of the community, by selectively promoting the growth of B12 producers.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

In contrast, Septin7-deficient hematopoietic stem cells failed to engraft and establish donor chimerism following transplantation, indicating that Septin7 is essential for hematopoietic stem cell function under stress conditions. To reconcile these contradictory findings, we analyzed the effects of Septin7 deletion in hematopoietic cells from mice with either pan-hematopoietic or lymphoid lineage-specific Septin7 deletion. Our results demonstrate that Cre-induced deletion of the floxed Septin7 allele is inefficient during the early stages of hematopoiesis, suggesting strong selection pressure against Septin7 deficiency at this stage. In contrast, deletion of Septin7 at the common lymphoid progenitor stage, as well as in Hoxb8-immortalized hematopoietic progenitors, is efficient and does not result in any noticeable defects in cell division.

E.; von Zastrow, M.", "abstract": "Many GPCRs trigger a second phase of G protein-coupled signaling from endosomes after initiating signaling from the plasma membrane. This inherently requires receptors to increase the concentration of active-state G proteins on the endosome membrane, but how this is achieved remains incompletely understood. We addressed this question by dissecting the regulation of G protein abundance and activity on endosomes following activation of several Gs-coupled GPCRs-the {beta}2-adrenergic receptor, the VIP-1 receptor, and the adenosine 2b receptor-that are natively co-expressed and differ in their ability to internalize after activation. We first verify GPCR-triggered redistribution of Gs from the plasma membrane to a mixed population of intracellular membranes, including endosomes, that is both reversible after receptor inactivation and triggered irrespective of the ability of the GPCR to internalize. We next show that GPCRs trigger this redistribution process at native expression levels and describe a method, using conformational biosensors, to detect endosomal activation of endogenous Gs. Applying this method, we show that GPCR-mediated production of active-state Gs on endosomes depends on receptor endocytosis, whereas increasing the net amount of Gs on endosomes does not. Our results support a model for Gs regulation on endosomes mediated by two spatially separated receptor coupling events-one at the plasma membrane controlling endosomal Gs abundance and another at endosomes controlling Gs activity. Additionally, our results reveal location-bias in the selectivity of G protein activation on endosomes that is differentially programmed by GPCRs in a receptor-specific manner.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

This approach yielded sinonasal malignancies with diverse histologies, including sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated sinonasal carcinoma, and sinonasal neuroendocrine tumors characteristic of olfactory neuroblastoma. Surprisingly, rather than observing distinct sgRNA profiles across sinonasal tumor subtypes, common recurrent mutations were identified in Nf1 (79%), Rasa1 (74%), and Trp53 (68%) across malignancies with distinct histologies. Utilizing an orthogonal approach, we confirmed that Nf1/Trp53 were required for sinonasal tumorigenesis.

Indeed, both tumor cell lines derived from our loss-of-function approach as well as from human sinonasal malignancies displayed significant sensitivity to MEK inhibition in standard in vitro culture and organoid models.

M.; Wibral, M.", "abstract": "Predictive-coding like theories agree in describing top-down communication through the cortical hierarchy as a transmission of predictions generated by internal models of the inputs. With respect to the bottom-up connections, however, these theories differ in the neural processing strategies suggested for updating the internal model. Some theories suggest a coding strategy where unpredictable inputs, i.e., those not captured by the internal model, are passed on through the cortical hierarchy, whereas others claim that the predictable part of the inputs is passed on. Here, we addressed which neural coding strategy is employed in cortico-cortical connections using an information-theoretic approach. Our framework allows for quantifying two core aspects of both strategies, namely, predictability of inputs and information transfer, through local active information storage and local transfer entropy, respectively. A previous study on the neural processing of retinal ganglion cells connected to the lateral geniculate nucleus showed a coding for predictable information, captured by an increase in the information transfer with the predictability of inputs. Here, we further investigate predictive coding strategies at the cortical level. In particular, we analyzed LFP activity obtained from intracranial EEG recordings in humans and spike recordings from mouse cortex. We detected cortico-cortical connections with increasing information transfer with the predictability of inputs in recorded channels from frontal, parietal and temporal areas in human cortex. In the mouse visual system, we detected connections exhibiting both an increase and decrease in the information transfer with input predictability, although the former was predominant. Our evidence supports the presence of both predictive coding strategies at the cortical level, with a potential predominance of encoding for predictable information.\n\nSummaryThe ability of the brain to infer the hidden causes of sensory experiences has been conceptualized within the computational framework of predictive coding. This framework explains perceptual inference and learning as a process of constantly updating an internal model of the world. Predictive coding describes cortical activity as a communication of sensory evidence and predictions generated from prior expectations. While different views of predictive coding agree on the communication of prior expectations throughout cortex, they differ in how internal expectations are updated. One view states that, to update the internal model, the cortex propagates the mismatch between the expected neural activity and the actual neural response to sensory stimuli. In contrast, another view suggests that the cortex propagates the match between the expected neural activity and the actual neural response. In this work, we were able to tease apart these two views, both in human cortex and the mouse visual system, using information theory. We observed that the brain predominantly propagates expected information, i.e., the match between prior expectations and incoming sensory inputs.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Across organoid conditions that varied by relative starting lineage ratios, we observed the spontaneous emergence of disease- relevant transitional cell states, including Sox9+ stressed progenitors, RAS-like intermediates, and hillock-like cells, alongside distinct macrophage activation profiles. In mesenchyme-rich contexts, epithelial-immune-mesenchymal crosstalk appeared to reinforce inflammatory signaling and stabilize transitional persistence, while immune- dominant inputs favored ATI-like repair and squamous remodeling. Hillock-like cells displayed context-specific polarization and expressed immune-regulatory genes, suggesting a role as epithelial orchestrators that help calibrate inflammatory response during regeneration. Connectomic analysis via NICHES revealed that regenerative outcomes were associated with dynamic multicellular signaling networks that integrate stress sensing, immune coordination, and epithelial resilience.

Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding.

We developed two shuttle plasmids--pGBSedit for genome editing and pGBScrispri for inducible CRISPR interference--derived from an Enterococcus faecium system and optimized for GBS. Using these tools, we achieved targeted gene insertions, markerless deletions, and efficient, template-free mutagenesis via alternative end-joining repair. Furthermore, a catalytically inactive dCas12a variant enabled inducible gene silencing, with strand-specific targeting effects. The system demonstrated broad applicability across multiple GBS strains and minimal off-target activity, as confirmed by whole-genome sequencing.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of solvents such as ethanol and methanol for extracting bioactive compounds and to analyse the phytochemical contents of Aloe vera extracts using various biochemical assays. The dinitro salicylic acid test (DNSA) quantified reducing sugars with ethanol extracts yielding 870 mg/ml compared to 450 mg/ml for methanol extracts. The Biuret test for proteins revealed concentrations of 13.8 mg/ml in ethanol extracts and 13.03 mg/ml in methanol extracts. The Barfoeds test indicated carbohydrate concentrations of 960 mg/ml in ethanol extracts. A qualitative test for steroids confirmed their presence in both solvents, with ethanol showing a more intense reaction, suggesting a higher concentration of steroidal compounds. The results establish ethanol as a more efficient solvent for extracting phytochemicals from Aloe vera. Antimicrobial activity test against E. coli demonstrated superior inhibition zones for ethanol extract, highlighting their potential as natural antibacterial agents. The research indicates the significance of solvent selection in optimizing the therapeutic utility of Aloe vera.

Here, we investigated the pathogenicity and transmission efficiency of three recent clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses isolated from a bovine, mountain lion, and a human case using Syrian hamsters. Intranasal inoculation with 104 TCID50 resulted in productive virus replication in the respiratory tract and shedding for all three isolates. Transmission studies showed limited efficiency via direct contact and airborne routes for all three isolates. Although overall transmission was inefficient, the human H5N1 isolate demonstrated relatively greater contact transmissibility than the bovine and mountain lion isolates. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the Syrian hamster model complements existing animal models for influenza A virus research and expands the resources available for investigating the pathogenicity, transmissibility, and efficacy of countermeasures against HPAIV H5N1.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Primary cutaneous melanomas at early stage offer a unique opportunity to uncover fundamental mechanisms of tumor initiation, progression, and immune surveillance, but detailed spatial profiling of early disease remains limited. Here we integrate high-plex cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) imaging, spatial transcriptomics, and conventional histology to identify factors associated with de-differentiation and dermal invasion in early-stage melanomas. We demonstrate a high level of variability from one primary cancer to the next, from one 100-300 cell microregion to the next within a single cancer, and from one cell to the next within a microregion. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity is influenced by local features of the microenvironment including proximity to T and myeloid cells and to perivascular environments. Thus, tumor plasticity and spatial heterogeneity arise early in melanoma development, potentially allowing for competition among multiple tumor states during the emergence of invasive disease.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThis study shows that tumor cell dedifferentiation and plasticity are locally patterned in primary human melanomas under the influence of microenvironment components such as myeloid cells and vasculature.

The experiment was repeated in eight year-by-site environments, allowing to evaluate the stability of baking quality in mixtures and pure stands.\n\nThe results showed that the effects of the mixtures were negative for most flour quality parameters. Furthermore, these effects were not due to changes in cultivar proportions within the mixtures, but rather to cultivar-specific alterations in response to the mixture environment. Finally, mixtures significantly increased the stability of flour quality, by buffering the effects of fluctuating weather conditions.\n\nThis study is the first to extensively investigate flour quality in eight contrasting environments.

Here we tested whether functional connectivity in SeLECTS during language tasks predicts language performance. We recorded high-density EEG from right-handed children with SeLECTS (n=31) and age-matched controls (n=32) during verb generation, repetition, and resting tasks. Phonological awareness was assessed using the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing-2. Connectivity between bilateral motor cortices and language regions (the left inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices and their right hemisphere homologues) was measured using weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI). Children with SeLECTS demonstrated significantly elevated connectivity between motor and language regions during language processing. Motor-to-frontal connectivity was higher in SeLECTS during both verb generation and repetition tasks. Frontal-to-temporal connectivity was elevated specifically during verb generation. Higher interhemispheric connectivity (between the left and right hemispheres) during language tasks strongly predicted worse phonological awareness in children with SeLECTS ({beta}= -40 to -61, all p<0.005), but not controls. Together, we found that children with SeLECTS exhibited pathologically elevated connectivity between motor and language networks that was strongly associated with impaired phonological awareness. These findings identify aberrant interhemispheric connectivity as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying language dysfunction and establish EEG-based connectivity measures as a potential biomarker for guiding targeted neuromodulation therapies to treat cognitive impairments in pediatric epilepsy.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We examined a clinical cohort of adolescents and young adults at risk for psychosis (n= 21) --meeting DSM-5 criteria for Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome (APS)or Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SCZT)-- and age-/sex-matched healthy controls (n =13), as well as an independent non-clinical sample of adolescents (n = 61). We first aimed at assessing the reproducibility of MRSI measures across datasets and scanning sites, then validate the feasibility of a whole-brain voxel-based analyses on 3D-MRSI data and eventually test the sensitivity of this approach. Metabolite distributions showed reproducible regional variation in standard space between the two independent samples and scanning sites (r ranging from 0.82 to 0.99). Relative to controls, at-risk participants exhibited higher tNAA in frontal grey matter; the SCZT subgroup additionally displayed widespread cortical and subcortical Ins elevations compared with both APS and controls. Voxel-based analyses of structural (i.e., gray and white matter volumes or densities) and dijusion (i.e., generalized fractional anisotropy) parameters yielded no significant dijerences between risk participants and controls.

Current lie detection methods such as the polygraph test have been found to be unreliable (Meijer et al. 2017). New lie detection technology is currently arising that is based on fMRI; however, single subject tests have only been successful in detecting lies 88% of the time (Langleben et al., 2005; Wild, 2005). One of the main problems with most fMRI-based approaches is that they assume that various acts of deception involve common brain regions, (Ganis et al., 2003). In this work I propose a much more accurate fMRI lie detection method that does not make this assumption and is domain based. In my investigation, rather than trying to localize brain regions that are indicative of lying in general, I localize brain regions that indicate lying specifically about face recognition. In criminal investigations one frequently needs to establish familiar relations between a suspect, victim and/or witness. This type of information can be used as circumstantial evidence in a crime. In this work I propose to use fMRI to detect whether a suspect has any familiarity with an individual face.

Our study revealed that patients with flares of lupus nephritis (LN) and intestinal expansions of the anaerobic commensal, Ruminococcus gnavus (RG), displayed whole blood transcriptome profiles indicative of platelet, neutrophil, and myeloid cell activation, a profile reminiscent of sepsis. Serum analysis confirmed elevated serum levels of Platelet Factor 4 and neutrophil extracellular traps, which significantly correlated with levels of IgG-antibody to a novel lipoglycan (LG) produced by pathogenic RG strains, which was also documented in an independent LN cohort. To test for causality, in vivo mouse models further demonstrated that gut colonization with LG-producing RG strains, as well as a single intraperitoneal challenge with an LG preparation, caused platelet activation and megakaryocytosis in bone marrow and spleen. Mice colonized with RG strains that produce LG developed cellular infiltration of the kidneys by neutrophils and monocytes. Hence, RG expansions during renal flares may identify a specific LN flare endotype driven by thromboinflammatory mechanisms. Antibodies that arise from immune exposure to the RG lipoglycan may serve as a surrogate biomarker, helping to elucidate the impact of the relationship between gut microbiota communities and clinical outcomes in patients afflicted by LN.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia are two multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogens that significantly influence host health and alter their antibiotic response when in coinfection. To characterize host-pathogen dynamics, we examined infection progression, immune responses, bacterial virulence gene expression, and antibiotic susceptibility in single and coinfections involving acute and chronic P. aeruginosa strains combined with B. cenocepacia. This work was entirely performed in vivo using G. mellonella larvae as a model. Larval survival and bacterial dissemination were monitored, revealing tissue-specific patterns of infection. Our findings indicated that coinfections increased larval lethality and worsened overall health. Notably, B. cenocepacia suppressed host melanization and immune responses, while P. aeruginosa triggered a strong immune activation. Coinfection also induced upregulation of virulence genes in both pathogens. Surprisingly, increased antibiotic susceptibility was observed in coinfected groups compared to single infections. This study advances understanding of host-pathogen interactions in polymicrobial infections and highlights the need for improved therapeutic strategies.\n\nAuthor summaryBacterial coinfections, such as the ones with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia are especially critical in chronic lung diseases like cystic fibrosis, where persistent polymicrobial infections drive lung damage and health decline. Coinfection can enhance pathogen survival, increase drug tolerance, and disrupt host immunity, leading to worse clinical outcomes. Understanding coinfection dynamics can help improve treatment strategies, optimize antibiotic use and improve infection monitorization. Therefore, by studying and understanding microbial interactions, researchers can develop more effective therapies, ultimately improving patient care and combating the growing challenge of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Its ability to evade antiviral treatments and vaccine-induced immunity underscores the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Our study identifies cis-aconitate (cis-aco), a mitochondria-derived metabolite, as a potent dual-action agent against influenza, independently of its metabolic derivative, itaconate. Cis-aco impairs viral polymerase activity, suppressing viral mRNA expression and protein synthesis to inhibit replication across a range of influenza subtypes. This antiviral efficacy is confirmed in ex vivo human airway and lung organotypic models. Beyond its antiviral properties, cis-aco exhibits potent anti-inflammatory effects, disrupting key inflammatory cascades and reducing the secretion of inflammatory mediators. In a mouse model of influenza pneumonia, cis-aco mitigates viral replication, inflammation, and immune cell activation, significantly improving survival. Notably, its efficacy persists even when administered at later stages of infection, when oseltamivir/Tamiflu(R) is no longer effective. These findings position cis-aco as a promising influenza treatment, combining antiviral and anti-inflammatory benefits within a clinically relevant timeframe.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

J.; Smith, I. T.; Olson, B. S.; Alessi, A. F.; Galagali, H.; Lalk, K.; Schmidt, M. N.; Ranke, K. J.; Kim, J. K.; Karp, X.", "abstract": "The mechanisms by which developmental pathways are modulated to accommodate developmental arrest are poorly understood. In adverse environments, dauer diapause can interrupt developmental progression after the second larval molt. During continuous (non-dauer) development, a heterochronic molecular timer consisting primarily of microRNAs and their targets controls the progression of stage-specific cell fates in lateral hypodermal seam cells. In unfavorable conditions, the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor and the DAF-12 nuclear hormone receptor in its ligand-free state promote dauer formation and oppose the expression of let-7 family microRNAs, thus pausing developmental progression during dauer. Surprisingly, we found that daf-16(0) post-dauer adults showed reiterative heterochronic defects including missing or gapped adult alae, lack of seam-cell fusion, and reduced expression of the adult-specific col-19p::gfp marker. Consistent with these adult cell fate defects, let-7-family microRNA expression was reduced in daf-16(0) post-dauer larvae. Addition of the DAF-12 ligand, dafachronic acid, suppressed the reiterative phenotypes in daf-16(0) post-dauer animals. Notably, addition of dafachronic acid to daf-16 mutants rescued levels of let-7 family transcriptional reporters but did not affect levels of these reporters in daf-16(+) control strains. Dafachronic acid is synthesized from cholesterol which is normally sequestered in the intestinal lumen during dauer. We found that a fluorescent cholesterol analog was not maintained in daf-16 mutant larvae during dauer recovery. Consistent with this finding, timed auxin-mediated depletion of DAF-16 indicated that daf-16 is required before dauer formation, rather than after dauer, to prevent reiterative seam cell fates in post-dauer larvae and adults. Furthermore, depletion of DAF-16 from the intestine recapitulated defects in adult cell fate. Taken together, we propose a model whereby daf-16 acts prior to dauer formation to enable dafachronic acid synthesis by retaining cholesterol during dauer recovery. Ligand-bound DAF-12 then promotes dauer recovery and expression of let-7 family microRNAs, thereby promoting adult cell fate. Thus, daf-16 and daf-12 coordinate dauer exit with the resumption of a developmental pathway.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

In this study, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening in patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) to identify genetic dependencies of cell survival and therapy resistance. Our screening identified flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) as a key driver of GSC survival, with enhanced dependency under temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. Genetic perturbation of FEN1 reduced GSC self-renewal and proliferation in vitro, and prolonged survival in a patient-derived xenograft model of GBM. FEN1 inhibition (FEN1i) preferentially affected highly aggressive or recurrent GBM models compared with less aggressive GBMs and healthy neural stem cells. Moreover, FEN1 inhibition synergized with TMZ only in these aggressive FEN1i-sensitive GSCs, providing cancer-selective killing and TMZ sensitization in the most untreatable of GBMs. Mechanistically, FEN1i-sensitive GSCs exhibited greater proliferation and sphere formation, while stalling their proliferation conferred resistance to FEN1 inhibition. Single-cell transcriptomics further linked FEN1 expression to stemness and the DNA damage response, elucidating broader determinants of FEN1 dependency. These findings establish FEN1 as a promising therapeutic target in GBM, offering a strategy for both selective targeting and enhancement of TMZ efficacy in aggressive cancers.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThis study identifies FEN1 as a key vulnerability of glioblastoma stem cells, revealing its role in therapy resistance and stemness, and proposes FEN1 inhibition as a strategy to enhance temozolomide efficacy.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we use tethered, flying Drosophila melanogaster and a multisensory behavioral apparatus simulating forward flight to determine how visual and mechanosensory information are integrated and control active movements of an important multimodal sensory organ, the antennae. We found that flies perform active antennal movements in response to varying airflow, and that the direction of these movements changes depending on the visual environment. Next, we found that antennal movements are amplified in the presence of visual motion, but only when the fly was flying. Through mechanical and optogenetic manipulation of mechanosensory input, we found that mechanosensory feedback is vital to antennal positioning at flight onset. Additionally, we observed unexpected changes in wingbeat frequency when the antenna was mechanically stabilized, suggesting that multiple antennal mechanosensors contribute to flight regulation. Finally, we show that integration of mechanosensory and visual cues for controlling antennal motion follows in a \"winner-takes-all\" paradigm dependent on the stimulus frequency, mirroring visuo-mechanosensory guided behaviors in other species. Together, these results reveal novel behavioral gating of sensory information and expand our understanding of the efferent control of active sensing.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

At the synapse, most antigen-engaged receptor microclusters move inward toward the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) via retrograde F-actin flow, eventually clearing from the cell surface. This retrograde movement and receptor downregulation maintain antigen receptor homeostasis, critical for adaptive immunity, though its regulation remains unclear. Using live T cells, we identified a significant pool of antigen-engaged microclusters moving anterogradely toward the cell periphery, rather than the cSMAC. This movement was driven by actin waves propagating outward and coupling to microclusters through the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mode of actin dynamics, anterograde actin waves, that co-exist with retrograde flow and direct microclusters away from the downregulation zone. This dual actin behavior underscores the complex cytoskeletal mechanisms T cells employ to regulate receptor distribution and maintain signaling homeostasis during immune activation.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

However, these 3D kidney tissues lack biophysical cues from luminal flow and a drainage outlet. To address these limitations, we have created perfusable 3D models of UB and CD tubules. UB organoids are first generated from hiPSCs followed by their dissociation into individual UB cells. Individual UB cells are then seeded onto a 3D perfusable channel embedded within an extracellular matrix composed of fragmented basement membrane matrix and collagen I, where they self-assemble into a confluent monolayer. During in vitro perfusion, these cells exhibit UB-like marker expression over several weeks, during which they undergo budding akin to early branching morphogenesis in developing kidneys. To further promote network formation, UB cells are bioprinted adjacent to a perfusable UB tubule, which form interconnections through luminal fusion. Finally, these 3D perfusable UB tubules are differentiated into collecting duct tubules under luminal flow.

However, the circuitry that supports this integration remain unclear. Here, we combined 2-photon calcium imaging in navigating mice with brain-wide retrograde tracing to investigate how visual and positional information are represented and distributed across RSC subregions. We found a clear anterior-posterior gradient: anterior RSC neurons exhibited sharper, more reliable position tuning and preferred fast-moving visual stimuli, while posterior RSC neurons showed broader tuning and preferential responses to slower motion. These functional differences were paralleled by distinct patterns of long-range input: anterior RSC received denser projections from motor, parietal, and hippocampal-associated areas--regions implicated in position encoding--whereas posterior RSC was more strongly innervated by visual cortices.

In insects, the first visual processing stage of the brain, the lamina, plays an important role in parallel processing of this complex information. Its main relay neurons, lamina monopolar cells (LMCs), receive information directly from the photoreceptors and shape the contrast, luminance, spatial and temporal tuning of the insect visual system in a cell-type specific manner. One of their best-investigated downstream targets is the motion vision pathway. However, how LMC types that feed into motion processing delineate contrast and luminance is only known from fruit flies, while the contribution of LMCs to spatial processing has only been described in hawkmoths. Here, we provide a novel characterization of hawkmoths lamina monopolar cells, to integrate the contrast, luminance and spatial processing properties of LMCs in the motion pathway. We used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the anatomical fine structure of LMCs in a focal lamina cartridge, including their pre- and post- synaptic connections. Combining our novel LMC classification with intracellular recordings, we further investigated the functional role of hawkmoth L1 and L2 in terms of contrast and spatial processing. We show that unlike in flies, L1 and L2, the main relay neurons to the motion pathway, process contrast and luminance information in a similar manner. We further demonstrated that the spatial processing properties of these cells are highly similar as well, and can be explained by the density and the distribution of their synapses across different lamina layers. Based on these findings, we propose that the different lamina layers support distinct connectivity and functional roles in spatial processing.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

How such reproductive plasticity occurs in hermaphroditic organisms - allocating resources to both oocytes and sperm - are central questions of sex allocation research. Self-fertilizing hermaphrodites of the androdioecious nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibit a sequential transition from spermatogenesis to oogenesis, so the extent of self-sperm production determines both fertilization onset and lifetime reproductive potential under selfing. Despite this key role, it remains largely unclear whether such sequential hermaphrodites flexibly adjust sperm production to optimize self-fertilization across different environments. Here we directly quantified plasticity in C. elegans hermaphrodite self-sperm production in diverse experimental environments. We found that: (a) Sperm production was developmentally plastic, but such changes did not consistently translate into changes in self-progeny number, suggesting C. elegans self-fecundity is often oocyte-limited rather than sperm-limited; (b) Contrary to expectations, plastically increased sperm production did not delay the onset of fertilization across various environments; (c) Subtle environmental challenges, such as mild dietary restriction, did not affect sperm production but had a significant impact on developmental time, age at reproductive maturity, and germline proliferation. This emphasizes the relative environmental insensitivity of sperm production compared to other reproductive traits in hermaphrodites. (d) Plasticity in sperm and germline traits varied by genetic background, with notable differences between the laboratory strain N2 and wild strains.

We and others have previously demonstrated that hiPSC-derived endothelial progenitor cells (hiPSC-EPs) self-assemble into lumenized microvascular networks when cultured in 3D norbornene-functionalized hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels. Herein we investigated the early period of culturing to characterize contractility of hiPSC-EPs. We hypothesized that multi-cell cooperativity would increase over time and would be dependent on the original hydrogel storage modulus. To quantify cellular contractility either 4 or 7 days after encapsulation, 3D kinematic analysis was performed on single and small multi-cell clusters of hiPSC-EPs embedded in NorHA-based hydrogels. Contractile responses were significantly and non-linearly influenced by multicellularity, culture duration, and hydrogel stiffness. Novel to this study was the observation that NorHA hydrogels exhibited compressible behaviors, with greater compressibility occurring in NorHA hydrogels with lower stiffness. Hence, the kinematic analysis was modified to incorporate separate deviatoric and volumetric strain indices. At day 7, multicellularity synergistically increased both strain components.

K-mer based classifiers such as Kraken2 provide high speed and sensitivity, and are commonly used for low microbial biomass samples. However, their performance can be compromised by specific sources of error without proper parameter settings and incorporation of controls. Methods In this study, we analyzed six sequencing datasets of human tumor biopsies with Kraken2 and investigated how shared compact hash codes (i.e., identical hash codes across different k-mers), hash collision and the structure of reference databases can contribute to false positive taxonomic assignments in low biomass samples. Results We demonstrated that in samples with high non-microbial DNA noise, the classified taxa of Kraken2 in sequencing reads are significantly correlated with that of shuffled sequences using the default setting. These taxa showed a similar distribution as those overrepresented in the hash table construction of the reference database. Incorporation of controls using shuffled reads can separate significant taxa with more robust differences from those more affected by background noise. Although the confidence thresholds needed to minimize noise varied with taxa, a minimum value of 0.2 can also help reduce misclassifications.

Despite its severity, treatment options remain limited. RBC transfusion is a highly effective therapeutic option in SCD, particularly due to its capacity to improve oxygen delivery and reduce sickling by introducing healthy red blood cells, but it is associated with a significant risk of transfusion-related complications. Our study investigates the treatment potential of M101, a novel hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier derived from the marine worm Arenicola marina, in a mouse model of SCD. M101's unique properties, including its high oxygen-carrying capacity and indirect antioxidant outcome, make it a promising candidate for ameliorating SCD pathophysiology. The study demonstrates that M101 administration significantly reduces RBC sickling and hemolysis in SCD mice. Furthermore, M101 infusion significantly prevents microvascular occlusion in liver and lung and attenuates the inflammatory response after vaso-occlusion induction. These findings highlight M101 strong potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for managing or preventing painful vaso-occlusive crises in SCD. Further research is warranted to determine the optimal dosing regimen and to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of M101 in humans.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Food security and nutrition are increasingly slipping the grasp of those most vulnerable to market shocks, regional conflict and the effects of climate change. For smallholder farmers of sub-Saharan Africa, crop biodiversity can mitigate nutritional and livelihood risks, provide a varied diet and reinforce systemic resilience through redundancy of functions. However, ongoing and accelerating processes of cultural and genetic erosion have profoundly diminished varietal diversity, risking the loss of locally valued food plants from future harvests. Presented here is new data on the compositional profile of Hyptis spicigera Lam. syn. Cantinoa americana (Aubl.) Harley & J.F.B.Pastore (Lamiaceae), an underutilized and profoundly neglected precolonial food crop domesticated in historical times and once widely cultivated across equatorial Africa for its protein-rich oilseed. The amino acids profile of hyptis seed has not previously been determined, nor has its protein quality been assessed. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to investigate the nutritional value of hyptis seed including its proximate composition, amino acids profile and protein quality. A secondary objective was to construct a comprehensive review of historical literature and secondary data on the species, for which the published record is sparse and antiquated. Methods: A blended sample of hyptis seed was obtained from Apur market at Adwari subcounty in the Otuke District of northern Uganda. Proximate nutritional composition was assessed in three replicates, and amino acid analysis was performed in four replicates for 19 amino acids. A protein quality test was conducted using the WHO/FAO Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) method. All relevant historical literature was consulted, and a comparative review undertaken of flower morphology in 138 digitized herbarium specimens. Findings: Proximate composition of the seed was found to comprise 28.8% lipids and 19.7% protein, a lipid to protein ratio of 3:2 comparable to some Sesamum species. The nutritionally limiting amino acid was found to be lysine, although the deficiency is not statistically significant based on an amino acid score of 99% and a standard error (SD) of 0.18. Protein quality was found to be relatively high, with a PDCAAS of 84% comparing favorably both to pulses (pea) and pseudocereals (quinoa). An historical review of the species valorizes hyptis as a valued and productive resource within smallholder farming systems, a precolonial African food crop meriting further attention.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

In a metagenomic survey of natural infections on the susceptible traditional landrace 'Rheintaler Ribelmais' in the Swiss Rhine Valley during 2016 and 2017, we found that one of these clonal lineages ('Small clonal' cluster) was dominant in the region. We repeated the surveys in subsequent years and applied a novel pooling strategy to facilitate large-scale sampling by combining ten infected leaves per sampling location. This approach increased sample throughput while reducing sequencing and laboratory costs. The new survey revealed in 2021 and 2022 a significant temporal shift in population structure of exotic genetic lineages from the tropical 'Kenyan' cluster, which have become predominant. It indicates recent introduction and establishment of genetically diverse, tropical <it>E. turcicum</it> lineages into a temperate agricultural system, possibly facilitated by climate change and global seed exchange. Phyllobiome analyses of infected leaves showed that microbial community composition varied across years but remained largely consistent between maize variety types (landrace vs. hybrid).

It is exchanged between the intracellular and extracellular compartments through the proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters and between the cytosol and mitochondria through the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, where it serves as a primary carbon source for respiration. Aim: Our goal is to present a detailed protocol for quantifying cytosolic pyruvate concentration in neurons at single-cell resolution using a minimally invasive, two-point calibration approach with the FRET-based genetically-encoded fluorescent indicator Pyronic. Approach: This protocol is based on a non-invasive pharmacological two-point calibration approach, where Pyronic s dynamic range ({Delta}RMAX) is established by using trans-acceleration exchange to deplete intracellular pyruvate (RMIN), and by inducing Pyronic saturation (RMAX) through the combination of inhibition of pyruvate export, stimulation of its production, and blockade of its mitochondrial consumption. The protocol also incorporates the previously published KD values for Pyronic obtained from in vitro experiments. This procedure does not require the use of detergents to permeabilize the cells. Results: Implementing this protocol enables the measurement of absolute cytosolic pyruvate concentrations. This quantitative parameter facilitates comparisons of pyruvate metabolism across different cells, samples and experimental batches, thereby enabling the comparison between a plethora of experimental conditions. Conclusions: The FRET-based fluorescent indicator Pyronic can be reliably calibrated using a minimally invasive, pharmacology-based two-point calibration protocol in neurons, thus providing a robust and quantitative method to study pyruvate metabolism under various physiological and pathological scenarios.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We focused on the host-specific leaf pathogens Zymoseptoria tritici and Zymoseptoria passerinii. By using microbiome metabarcoding and coculture interactions, we evaluated the influence of virulent (wild host-infecting pathogen) and avirulent (domesticated host-infecting pathogen) Zymoseptoria lineages on the leaf microbiome of the wild grasses Aegilops cylindrica and Hordeum murinum which are hosts to virulent lineages of Z. tritici and Z. passerinii, respectively. Our microbiome analysis showed that the fungal communities were affected by virulent lineages, while the avirulent lineages had the most negative correlations with bacteria. Both virulent and avirulent pathogens had the same spectrum of interactions when experimentally cocultured with bacteria. The intensity of pathogen-induced growth enhancement differed between Zymoseptoria lineages.

D.; Dall'Acqua, M. N.; Sanchez-Ramirez, S.; Cutter, A.

The pace of \"speciation clocks\" quantified with pre-zygotic and post-zygotic reproductive isolation, however, differs among taxa, with pre-zygotic isolation tending to evolve sooner in some but not all taxa. To address this issue in nematodes for the first time, here we infer the species tree and divergence times across the phylogeny of 51 species of Caenorhabditis. We incorporate several molecular evolutionary strategies in phylogenomic dating to account for complications in this group due to lack of fossil calibration, deep molecular divergence with synonymous-site saturation, and codon usage bias. By integrating divergence times with experimental data on pre- and post-zygotic reproductive isolation, we infer that post-zygotic isolation accumulates faster than pre-zygotic isolation in Caenorhabditis and that hybrid sterility evolves sooner than hybrid inviability. These findings are consistent with speciation being driven principally by intrinsic isolating barriers and the disproportionate fragility of germline developmental programs to disruption. We estimate that it takes approximately 50 million generations for intrinsic post-zygotic reproductive compatibility to be reduced by half, on average, between diverging pairs of Caenorhabditis. The protracted reproductive isolation clocks in Caenorhabditis may, in part, reflect the capacity to retain population genetic hyperdiversity, the incomplete sampling of global biodiversity, and as-yet uncharacterized incipient or cryptic species.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We performed a positive selection analysis based on the dN/dS ratio and examined the correlation between amino acid variants and two social phenotypes. We also analysed gene expression data to explore associations between brain receptor expression and social phenotype variation. Our findings reveal that, while most sites in nonapeptide receptors are under strong purifying selection, a few sites - primarily in the extended intracellular loop 3 (IL3) of VTR2A receptors - show signatures of positive selection.

We also show that somatic mutations can exacerbate these patterns, although evidence for substantive rates in empirical systems high enough to impact phylogenetic patterns is scarce.

Genetic monitoring has become essential for detecting fragmentation and tracking its progress. However, the coherent interpretation of genetic monitoring data and understanding the genetic consequences of fragmentation require frameworks that accurately represent real-world complexity. Existing theoretical frameworks typically rely on simplified spatial structures and do not adequately capture the heterogeneous migration patterns of natural populations. Here, we integrate network theory and mathematical population genetics to develop a framework for studying the genetic consequences of fragmentation processes, explicitly accounting for heterogeneous connectivity and temporal dynamics. We apply this framework to examine how different fragmentation processes affect genetic measures commonly used in genetic monitoring. We find that different fragmentation scenarios produce substantially distinct trajectories in key genetic measures, sometimes exhibiting rapid transitional dynamics, suggesting that the interpretation of genetic monitoring data must be tailored to ecological contexts. Furthermore, fragmentation can cause deviations from classical theoretical expectations, such as the expected correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation-by-distance) or between genetic diversity and connectivity. Finally, we propose and demonstrate detectable early warning signals in genetic monitoring data that precede rapid transitional phases. Our framework thus provides a practical interpretation of genetic monitoring data, bridging the gap between idealized theoretical models and real-world connectivity dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Traditional Sanger sequencing lacks sensitivity and reproducibility, whereas advanced next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches, such as rRNA-depleted RNA-seq or targeted amplicon-seq, involve high costs, complex workflows, and limited accessibility. To address these limitations, we developed a rapid and cost-effective long-read sequencing approach, termed premium PCR sequencing, for digital quantification of RNA-editing and intron retention events in targeted chloroplast transcripts. This method combines multiplexed high-fidelity PCR amplification with Oxford Nanopore sequencing and custom in-house Perl and Python scripts for streamlined data processing, including barcode-based demultiplexing, strand reorientation, alignment to a pseudo-genome, manual editing-site inspection, and splicing variant identification and comparison. Using this platform, we analyzed the ndhB and ndhD transcripts, two chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase genes with the highest number of known editing sites, in an inducible CRISPR interference (iCRISPRi) system targeting MORF2, a key RNA-editing factor. Our results revealed MORF2 dosage-dependent reductions in C-to-U editing efficiency, with significant defects observed in the strongly repressed P1-12 line. Moreover, we identified an accumulation of intron-retaining ndhB transcripts, specifically in Dex-treated iCRISPRi lines, indicating impaired chloroplast splicing functions upon MORF2 suppression.

Temporal prediction mechanisms emerge well before birth and evolve from early sensory-driven responses to complex top-down processing within the first year, shaped by both innate and experience-dependent factors, with influences like wakefulness and musical exposure that modulate neural integration across sensory and higher-order brain regions.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Y.", "abstract": "In natural language, word meanings are contextualized, that is, modified by meanings of nearby words. Inspired by self-attention mechanisms in transformer-based large language models (LLMs), we hypothesized that contextualization in the brain results from a weighted summation of canonical neural population responses to words with those of the words that contextualize them. We examined single unit responses in the human hippocampus while participants listened to podcasts. We first find that neurons encode the position of words within a clause, that they do so at multiple scales, and that they make use of both ordinal and frequency-domain positional encoding (which are used in some transformer models). Critically, neural responses to specific words correspond to a weighted sum of that words non-contextual embedding and the embedding of the words that contextualize it. Moreover, the relative weighting of the contextualizing words is correlated with the magnitude of the LLM-derived estimates of self-attention weighting. Finally, we show that contextualization is aligned with next-word prediction, which includes prediction of multiple possible words simultaneously. Together these results support the idea that the principles of self-attention used in LLMs overlap with the mechanisms of language processing within the human hippocampus, possibly due to similar prediction-oriented computational goals.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we generated high-resolution cellular and spatial maps of healthy skin, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and paradoxical reactions using single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and in vitro assays. In paradoxical reactions, we identified a distinct transcriptional landscape characterized by myeloid and T-cell expansion and an altered keratinocyte phenotype shaped by TWEAK signaling.

It is a tightly regulated process involving an intricate network of signaling pathways and control mechanisms at the level of transcription, alternative mRNA splicing, translation and mRNA stability. However, regulation through alternative mRNA polyadenylation (APA), remains poorly understood. This study explores the function of CFIm25, a key APA regulator, in macrophage polarization. Our findings show that CFIm25 overexpression drives M1 polarization, as evident from increased nitric oxide synthase activity, CD80 expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, but dampens the M2 phenotype. Conversely, CFIm25 knockdown suppresses M1 traits and promotes M2 characteristics. Functionally, CFIm25 enhances phagocytosis, migration, and cancer cell inhibition. Mechanistically, CFIm25 favors proximal polyadenylation site usage of AKT2 mRNA, increasing Akt2 protein levels to support M1 polarization. Blocking this site with an antisense oligonucleotide reduces Akt2 expression and M1 traits. These findings establish CFIm25 as a crucial regulator of macrophage identity, offering insights into RNA-based immune regulation and potential therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

In vegetative cell division, irregularly spaced cross-walls form within vegetative hyphae, whereas in sporogenic hyphae, regularly spaced sporulation septa form synchronously, leading to spore formation. However, the mechanisms controlling these processes largely remain unknown. The bacterial dynamin-like protein pair DynAB was previously reported to be a component of sporulation septa. Here, we reveal that DynA and DynB have critical roles in both cell division modes, regulating the formation of sporulation septa and cross-walls, with the Streptomyces cell division protein SsgB modulating their activities. dynAB deletion and overexpression, respectively, increased and abrogated cross-wall formation in vegetative hyphae, and Streptomyces DynAB also inhibited cell division in Escherichia coli, resulting in formation of unicellular filamentous cells and suggesting an ancient and conserved function for these proteins. Notably, SsgB could relieve the inhibition of cell division by DynAB in both Streptomyces and E. coli. In contrast to DynAB, SsgB overexpression generated spore-like compartments in vegetative hyphae, a phenomenon that required disruption of the DynAB complex. Fluorescent tags revealed dynamic localization of DynAB during development, and further analyses indicated that, in sporogenic hyphae, the timing of DynAB expression, their GTP-binding activity, and interaction with SsgB were associated with the synchronous initiation of sporulation septation. Our findings establish DynAB as an integrator of spatiotemporal cues in bacterial multicellularity and provide insights into the evolution of complex cell cycle regulation in prokaryotes.\n\nSignificanceThe evolution of multicellularity in bacteria involved the development of complex mechanisms to spatially and temporally coordinate cell division. Streptomyces, renowned for their production of bioactive secondary metabolites, exemplify bacterial complexity. This study reveals how Streptomyces employ the dynamin-like proteins DynAB as a bifunctional molecular switch, enabling transition between vegetative and reproductive growth through integrated interactions with developmentally regulated proteins and the availability of the energy supplier GTP. Importantly, DynAB could repress cell division in both Streptomyces and Escherichia coli, suggesting an evolutionary origin of these proteins prior to bacterial multicellularity.

While the mechanical forces and signaling pathways governing NTC have been characterized in vertebrates, the transcriptional programs coordinating cell behaviors during closure remain less understood. Here, we identify a transcriptional circuit involving Lmx1, Cdkn1b, and Msx that regulates dorsal midline dynamics during NTC in the tunicate Ciona. High-resolution HCR \\in situ hybridization reveals that Lmx1 is dynamically enriched at the zippering point and advances in a posterior-to-anterior transcription wave, while Msx is downregulated in the same region, marking a transition from early neural patterning to morphogenetic execution. As closure progresses, Lmx1 and Cdkn1b exhibit complementary, alternating expression at the dorsal midline, resembling a pair-rule-like pattern. Misexpression studies show that Lmx1 promotes proliferation and activates its own expression, whereas Cdkn1b limits proliferation and impedes closure. Single-cell RNA-seq reveals transcriptionally distinct dorsal neural populations enriched for Lmx1 or Cdkn1b, supporting spatially organized cell-cycle states. These findings suggest that a transcriptional switch from Msx to Lmx1, followed by spatially alternating Lmx1 and Cdkn1b activity, coordinates proliferation and neural fold fusion during NTC.

In the Appalachian region of the United States, natural gas development often occurs in forested areas, which can cause high levels of forest disturbance and loss. Here, we use nationwide forest inventory and remotely sensed data in a Bayesian model to quantify the impacts of natural gas development at fine spatial resolutions between 2008-2021. Based on well permit locations in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, the analysis quantifies disturbance area, forest carbon loss, and opportunity cost with associated levels of uncertainty at the pixel-level. Overall, we estimate 10,854 ha of forest land were disturbed, resulting in 542,675 Mg ({+/-} 4,275) of forest carbon loss. The opportunity cost associated with these disturbances is estimated to be 575,246 Mg ({+/-} 30,774). Pixel-level estimates are generated for individual well sites, which can be aggregated to the county-level to highlight regional patterns. Specifically, we observe greater levels of disturbance in Northern West Virginia, while opportunity costs are greatest for large forested counties in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

This process profoundly influences genome evolution by introducing novel genetic material and driving genetic variation. However, the precise mechanisms facilitating these transfers remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we report a recent TE burst in the insect-pathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. Our analysis reveals that the actively transposing TEs were introduced via hitchhiking on a so-called Starship--a class of large, themselves horizontally transferable transposons found within the fungal subphylum Pezizomycotina. This particular Starship carried 73 TEs, 43 of which exhibited increased copy numbers in the recipient genome, including 508 perfect copies. This expansion triggered extensive structural reshuffling across all chromosomes and led to the formation of a novel chromosome. Remarkably, this structural reorganization was associated with a dramatic phenotypic shift: the loss of pathogenicity. Expanding our analysis to other fungi, we found that Starship-mediated horizontal transfer of TEs is a general phenomenon. A majority (74%) of 618 published Starships also harbor TEs, which can constitute up to 72% of their content. Moreover, Starships serve as sources of actively transposing TEs: 16% of Starships carried at least one TE with a perfect copy found elsewhere in the genome, and identical TEs were observed on Starships from different species. Collectively, our results establish Starships as major vectors of horizontal TE transfer within Pezizomycotina and further highlight their profound impact on recipient fungal genomes through TE piggybacking.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Yeast, fungi and plants make their own folates and it has not been clear if plasma membrane folate transporters exist in these organisms. Using a synthetic lethal screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae we observed that deletions in a gene encoding the previously identified glutathione transporter, OPT1, was synthetically sick with a disruption in folate biosynthesis. Uptake experiments confirmed that Opt1p/Hgt1p can transport folinic acid and the naturally abundant methyl tetrahydrofolate. As S. cerevisiae Opt1p was able to transport both folate and glutathione, we used alanine-scanning mutants of the residues in the transmembrane domains of the channel to identify the residues required specifically for the uptake of folates and distinct from those required for glutathione. We further examined the oligopeptide transporter family of other organisms for the presence of folate transporters. In C. albicans, CaOPT1, the orthologue of S. cerevisiae OPT1 efficiently transported folate but not glutathione, while the previously characterized glutathione transporter, CaOPT7 could not transport folate. Aspergillus fumigatus has eight homologues of the oligopeptide transporter family, of which OptB and OptH could transport folates. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the Opt1 homologs AtOpt2, AtOpt4, and AtOpt6 could transport folates. This discovery of folate transporters across fungi and plants fills a critical gap in our understanding of folate metabolism, and can benefit the exploitation of these pathways in pathogenic fungi, and in plants.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Understanding how some lineages evolved into major pathogens remains a central challenge and may be advanced by comparisons with their nonpathogenic counterparts. Integrative approaches have become essential for delimiting species and reconstructing evolutionary relationships, particularly in lineages with cryptic diversity or extensive chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we formally characterize six Cryptococcus species representing distinct evolutionary lineages, comprising both newly discovered and previously recognized but unnamed taxa, through a combination of phylogenomic analyses, divergence metrics, chromosomal comparisons, mating assays, and phenotypic profiling. Among pathogenic taxa, we formally name Cryptococcus hyracis sp. nov., corresponding to the previously characterized VGV lineage within the C. gattii complex. In parallel, we describe five saprobic, nonpathogenic species isolated from fruit, soil, and bark beetle galleries, spanning four phylogenetic clades. We identify a strong ecological association with bark beetles for Cryptococcus porticicola sp. nov., the only newly described nonpathogenic species with multiple sequenced strains from diverse sites. In this species, we detect strain-level chromosomal variation and evidence of sexual reproduction, along with population-level signatures of recombination consistent with ongoing genetic exchange. Across the genus, chromosome-level comparisons reveal extensive structural variation, including species- and strain-specific rearrangements that may restrict gene flow. We also identify multiple instances of chromosome number reduction, often associated with centromere inactivation following interchromosomal rearrangements. Comparative metabolic profiling with Biolog phenotype microarrays reveals clade-level differentiation and distinct substrate preferences, which may reflect metabolic divergence and habitat-specific diversification. Notably, we confirm that thermotolerance is restricted to clinically relevant taxa.

In tubers of Solanum tuberosum, it is controlled by a heteromultimeric isoamylase complex composed of ISA1 and ISA2. Moreover, two non-catalytic starch binding proteins (i.e., ESV1 and LESV) regulate leaf starch metabolism in Arabidopsis. Both proteins interact with starch glucans through a C-terminal antiparallel {beta}-sheet domain and differ by the presence of a 115 amino acid N-terminal overhang in LESV. Here we report the CRIPSR/Cas9 inactivation of LESV or ESV1 in potato and the characterization of the respective tuber starches. Starch from esv1 mutants was unaffected whereas granule diameter was severely reduced in tubers of lesv plants. This was negatively correlated to the number of granules, coherent with an altered starch initiation phenotype. Strikingly, scanning electron microscopy of purified starches revealed that lesv plants phenocopy isa1 and isa2 antisense lines described 20 years ago. A physical interaction between LESV and ISA1 was previously demonstrated in rice. Here, we confirmed this interaction in potato using yeast two-hybrid assays, providing molecular evidence for their functional association in potato.

SA187 inoculation led to marked increases in biomass, primary root length, and lateral root density, with growth-promoting effects becoming more important with the severity of nitrate limitation. Analyses suggested enhanced nitrate uptake and improved nitrogen partitioning as indicated by reduced shoot carbon:nitrogen ratios.

Dormancy encompasses two primary phases: endodormancy, where internal signals, particularly elevated abscisic acid (ABA), block growth and necessitate chilling for release; and ecodormancy, where buds regain growth competence but remain quiescent until external conditions are favourable. In apple (Malus domestica), we demonstrated that BRANCHED1 (MdBRC1) serves as a central inhibitor of bud growth specifically during ecodormancy. In many plant species, BRC1-like transcription factors integrate environmental and hormonal signals, activating gene networks linked to growth repression, notably those involved in ABA biosynthesis and signalling. Gain-of-function studies in poplar confirmed that MdBRC1 robustly suppresses shoot growth in trees. Our comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed that MdBRC1 directly regulates a suite of dormancy-associated genes, reinforcing its role as a molecular brake on bud break. Importantly, we show that the apple gene FLOWERING LOCUS T2 (MdFT2) is transcriptionally upregulated after dormancy and might act as a key inducer of bud break. Our data reveal that MdFT2 physically interacts with MdBRC1, reducing MdBRC1 activity during ecodormancy. This antagonistic interaction acts as a molecular switch, facilitating the transition from ecodormancy to active bud growth as spring approaches. Together, these findings uncover a regulatory module that finely tunes bud break timing in apple trees and provide a foundation for breeding strategies to enhance fruit tree resilience and adaptability in the context of climate change.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We identified three distinct phases of bud quiescence: (i) para-dormancy (early summer), characterized by active metabolism and high levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, shikimate, and myo-inositol; (ii) endo-dormancy (late summer to autumn), where dormancy depth peaked in late summer and was marked by reduced respiration and bud water content, and a sharp decline in hexose levels with a concomitant increase in raffinose; and (iii) eco-dormancy (winter to spring), featuring increased respiration, sugar mobilization (notably sucrose, glucose, and trehalose), and reactivation of cell division, with a shift of cells into the G2 phase. Just prior to bud burst, we observed a significant accumulation of sugar-phosphates, providing evidence that supports their role in promoting bud burst also in grapevine. Our findings provide new insights into the biochemical and physiological regulation of bud dormancy and bud burst, contributing to a deeper understanding of dormancy transitions in perennial crops.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

E.; Dela Pena, R. A.; Pangilinan, C. R.; Hussain, M. A. S.; Mohamed, M.; Danaphal, A.; Reyes, A.; Banares, A.; Malison, M.; Cayanan, M. M.; Bagunu, J. V.; Totaan, E. V.; Totaan, D.", "abstract": "Background: Cycas spp. are widely distributed tropical plants growing predominantly in mountains and forest habitats. In the Philippines, Cycas spp. are found in Luzon Island particularly in Pampanga, Batangas, Bataan and Isabela provinces. Some Cycas species were found to be toxic while others have carcinogenic property as in the case of Cycas revoluta. Other Cycas species are used as remedies against ulcer and bowel movement problems. In this study, the bioactive potentials of the crude methanolic, ethanolic, ethyl acetate and chloroform leaf extracts of Arayat Pitogo (Cycas riuminiana Porte ex Regel) were investigated. The crude extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents and bioactivity, namely, radical scavenging, antibacterial and anti-fungal activities. Objective: The study sought to demonstrate variability in the phytochemical constituents, radical scavenging, antifungal and antibacterial activities of the four crude leaf extracts of Arayat Pitogo (Cycas riuminiana Porte ex Regel) obtained using four different extraction solvents, namely, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate and chloroform. Materials and Methods: Arayat Pitogo (C. riuminiana Porte ex Regel) leaves collected from Mt. Arayat in Magalang, Pampanga, Philippines were air dried and subsequently pulverized. The finely ground material was divided into four parts and separately soaked in four different AR grade solvents, namely, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate and chloroform for 48 hours. The filtrates were subjected to rotary evaporation at 40C to remove the solvents. Phytochemical analysis was performed using test tube method. The radical scavenging activity of the four crude extracts was carried out using DDPH free radical scavenging assay. For evaluation of the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts, the agar well antibiotic sensitivity method was used. Conclusion: Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that, of the four solvents used, the best extraction solvent for the phytochemicals in the leaves of Arayat Pitogo (C. riuminiana Porte ex Regel) is ethanol, followed by methanol, ethyl acetate and chloroform. The ethanolic and methanolic leaf extracts showed comparable antioxidant activity. The chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts also have comparable antioxidant activity but significantly lower than both methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The greatest antimicrobial activity was exhibited by the ethyl acetate extract, followed by chloroform, methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The variation and similarity in the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the different extracts can be attributed to different mechanisms of interactions, namely, independent joint action, additive, synergistic, competitive or antagonistic interactions, among the bioactive compounds present in the crude extracts. Further studies are needed to elucidate the structure of the different phytochemicals present in the leaf extracts of Arayat Pitogo (C. riuminiana Porte ex Regel) and the specific mechanisms of interaction among these phytochemicals.

How these cells coordinate organelle architecture and biosynthetic pathways to support such demands remains poorly understood. Here, we show at single-cell resolution that HECs rely on gene regulatory networks driven by IRE1-XBP1 and CREB3L1/2 transcription factors. These networks upregulate enzymes and transporters that control inter-organelle metabolic fluxes for the step-wise assembly of sulfated O-glycan synthesis, while scaling the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, reinforcing cargo trafficking and organizing sequential glycosyltransferase deployment. Genetic and pharmacological perturbations show that these transcriptional circuits sustain lymph node HEC morphology and function in lymphocyte homing, and drive ectopic induction of HEV during inflammation. Parallel transcriptional networks operate in GCs. Together, our findings define a conserved regulatory logic that integrates metabolic pathways and organelle architecture to enable committed sulfo-mucin cell specialization across distinct tissue contexts.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Remarkably, recent research has demonstrated that the skin can function as a natural vaccination site, producing specific antibodies against commensal microbes without inducing inflammation. However, S. epidermidis can transition into an opportunistic pathogen in clinical settings, forming resilient biofilms on medical implants and exhibiting increasing resistance to antibiotics (MRSE), posing a significant healthcare challenge. To address this challenge, advanced immunoinformatics strategies were leveraged to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine targeting the SdrG protein, a key mediator of S. epidermidis biofilm formation. The vaccines binding dynamics with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were evaluated through computational analyses, including molecular docking and 500-nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Stability assessments via Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), and Radius of Gyration (Rg) confirmed that the vaccine-TLR4 complex achieved structural equilibrium, with TLR4 maintaining rigidity while the vaccine exhibited adaptive flexibility for optimal binding. The Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) method revealed a strong binding affinity, with a peak free energy of -52.73 kcal/mol and an average of -24.72 {+/-} 9.5989 kcal/mol over the last 50 ns, indicating a thermodynamically favorable interaction. Furthermore, in silico cloning validated the vaccines expressibility, with successful integration into the pET-Sangamo-His vector (8560 bp) for optimal E. coli production. These findings underscore the vaccines potential to elicit a robust immune response by stably engaging TLR4, a critical step in innate immune activation. By combining computational precision with immunological insights, this study lays a foundation for developing an effective prophylactic strategy against S. epidermidis biofilm-associated infections.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Using multiple cell types including the human SupT1 T cell line and purified CD4-positive T cells, we demonstrate that PLSCR1 inhibits the replication of HIV-1 with diverse tropisms and subtypes, as well as HIV-2 and SIV. Mechanistically, we find that PLSCR1 blocks viral entry and cell-to-cell transmission by restricting HIV-1 virion-cell and cell-cell fusion without affecting CD4 or CXCR4 expression or virus binding to the cell surface. Notably, PLSCR1-mediated restriction of viral entry is independent of type I interferon signaling.

Radical cure of P. vivax malaria requires administration of a hypnozoitocidal drug, such as primaquine or tafenoquine. However, these drugs can cause severe haemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD deficiency is caused by more than 230 different variants at the gene level that confer different degrees of deficiency phenotypically. Understanding the distribution of different G6PD variants in affected populations is essential to inform safer antimalarial treatment strategies. This study aimed to develop a cost-effective sequencing assay targeting key regions of the G6PD gene, suitable for field deployment. A novel assay based on Nanopore technology was designed to amplify two amplicons covering exon 3 to exon 13, focusing on known variants associated with enzyme deficiency. A total of 79 samples from individuals in Cambodia, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and China were sequenced, and a bioinformatics pipeline was created for the targeted variant calling of 192 G6PD SNP mutations. The assay demonstrated reliable detection of known variants, with high concordance between runs, within runs, and with Sanger sequencing.

However, how two distinct organisms merged into one remains currently only partially understood. Protein-mediated metabolite exchange across the double-membrane chloroplast envelope is essential for plant cell function. Here, we investigate the evolutionary origins of outer envelope proteins (OEPs) involved in these transport processes. The mosaic nature of the nuclear genome and the deep evolutionary distance since plastid acquisition are major challenges. To address them, we combine sequence-based analyses with emerging structure-based tools, which together enable more sensitive evolutionary comparisons than traditional methods alone. To uncover distinct evolutionary trajectories, we focused on five OEP families: four {beta}-barrel proteins involved in metabolite transport and JASSY, the first published OPDA transporter. We found that the {beta}-barrel proteins were recruited in a stepwise manner and structural homologs of some OEPs point to early recruitment via endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT). Notably, OEP40 shows a recent structural rearrangement, lacking clear structural homologs in plants other than Arabidopsis, yet retaining sequence conservation across all major land-plant lineages. The JASSY-like family is found across plastid-bearing species, while true JASSY orthologs emerged in embryophytes likely via a stable recruitment of the characteristic lipid-binding domain. Overall, our findings highlight the dynamic nature of the chloroplast outer envelope and show how new functions evolved through structural reshaping and novel domain recruitment. Structure-based approaches thus powerfully complement sequence data, offering more in-depth insight into the evolution of plastid transport systems.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

In addition, while reasoning large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on mathematics, coding and general-reasoning benchmarks, their potential in scRNAseq analyses remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the advantages and limitations of employing DeepSeek-R1-0528, a recently developed open-source 671B-parameter reasoning LLM, for zero-shot scRNAseq cell type annotation. We find that DeepSeek-R1 prompted with a ranked list of 10 differentially expressed marker genes per cluster of single cells outperforms both its reasoning-enhanced, non-reasoning equivalent (DeepSeek-V3-0324) and GPT-4o in cluster-level annotations. At the level of single cells, DeepSeek-R1 prompted with the top 500 expressed genes in a cell outperforms its non-reasoning counterpart DeepSeek-V3, illustrating test-time scaling for bioinformatics tasks through natural language. Running DeepSeek-R1 in zero-shot classifier mode, with a prompt that presents a broad catalogue of cell type labels to choose from, improves its performance and generalizability across different datasets.

Here, we examined the spatial organization and interdependence of ESCRT-III subunits during mammalian cytokinetic abscission by depleting CHMP2A, a core ESCRT-III component. Using live cell imaging, structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM), we show that CHMP2A knockout cells display a significant delay--but not failure--in abscission, accompanied by distinct mislocalization phenotypes across ESCRT-III subunits.

UNC-116 is substantially degraded within 1 hour of auxin treatment, by which time bidirectional dense core vesicle (DCV) motility is affected. After 4 hours, dynein-driven DCV movement is lost and only limited plus-end-directed DCV motility remains, likely driven by kinesin-3 (UNC-104).

JWJ-01-378 induced TPM3-TRKA degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system and proteomics analysis confirmed the acute selectivity of JWJ-01-378 for achieving TPM3-TRKA degradation with minimal off-target effects. While JWJ-01-378 was also able to degrade wild-type TRK, it was unable to degrade TRK inhibitor resistant mutants and ALK fusions. Importantly, TPM3-TRKA degradation by JWJ-01-378 suppressed downstream signaling and reduced cancer cell viability, with improved responses compared to heterobifunctional control compounds that cannot degrade TPM3-TRKA. Together, our study expands the toolbox of compounds for evaluating targeted degradation of TRK fusions in cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=97 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/660465v1_ufig13.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 13\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17fac15org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@faad02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17484c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b82622_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG JWJ-01-378 recruits cereblon (CRBN) to induce potent and selective degradation of oncogenic TRK fusions, leading to a collapse in downstream signaling and loss of cancer cell viability.

Despite its therapeutic potential, targeting Arp2/3 remains challenging due to the lack of precise molecular insights into endogenous inhibitors. Arpin, a lamellipodia-localized Arp2/3 inhibitor, has emerged as a critical modulator of cancer migration; however, the structural and mechanistic basis of its inhibitory function remains unresolved. Here, we report the 1.65-Angstrom crystal structure of N-terminal globular domain of Arpin, revealing a unique structural fold distinct from all known Arp2/3-binding factors. Structural and biophysical analyses demonstrate that Arpin forms homodimers via a conserved interface, which is essential for cooperative inhibition of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. Functional studies in cancer models reveal that Arpin homodimerization potently suppresses lamellipodia-driven migration and invasion, effects further enhanced by engineered dimeric constructs or artificially designed dual-tailed peptides. These findings elucidate a structural basis for Arpin-mediated suppression of cancer cell motility and identify homodimeric cooperativity as a druggable mechanism for targeting metastatic progression. Our work provides a molecular framework for designing Arpin-inspired inhibitors to counteract therapeutic resistance and metastasis in cancers reliant on Arp2/3-driven actin dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

The ALDH2*2 allele (E487K) is one of the most common gene polymorphisms in humans, resulting in dysfunction of its enzyme activity. This study investigated in vivo mechanism of acute liver injury caused by exposure to allyl alcohol (AA) using Aldh2*2 knock-in (KI) mice with the same amino acid replacement as human ALDH2*2. A rapid burst of plasma acrolein as an active metabolite of AA, as well as plasma endogenous reactive aldehydes malondialdehyde (MDA) and formaldehyde, was observed at 10 min after exposure to 75 mg/kg of AA in the Aldh2*2 KI homozygous mice, which was not evident in the wild-type mice. Hepatocellular necrosis was more extensive in the Aldh2*2 KI homozygous mice than in the wild-type mice, which was preceded by hepatic glutathione depletion and was coincident with an accumulation of acrolein, MDA, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal adducts and iron deposition, suggesting an involvement of ferroptosis in the exacerbation of hepatic necrosis. Recovery from hepatic glutathione depletion was delayed in the homozygous mice compared with the wild-type mice, with a decreasing tendency of hepatic expression of cystine transporter xCT. These results suggest that increased hepatic glutathione consumption, due to decreased aldehyde detoxification capacity, can sensitize the Aldh2*2 KI homozygous mice to hepatic ferroptosis after the rapid \"aldehyde storm\". Our study revealed a crosstalk between aldehyde metabolism and ferroptosis pathways and potential health impacts of endogenous reactive aldehydes on ALDH2*2 carriers.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

In our method using DAF-FM, known as a NO detection probe, premature collagen fibers can be visualized via covalent binding to the allysine residues serving as precursors of cross-linking structures of collagen. In addition, we showed that the labeling method using two fluorescent probes with different colors, DAF-FM and DAR-4M, allows for pulse-chase observation of newly synthesized collagen fibers.

As sample numbers grow rapidly, it is often challenging to interpret the proteins with missing values that are often presented as \"NA\" (not available). It could be the evidence of no expression, low expression below the detection threshold, or false negative detection due to technical issues. Existing methods for missing values imputation, while generally useful, rarely consider the non-random NA values that inform biological significance. In the current study, we developed Biologically Informative NA Deconvolution (BIND) that applies an adaptive neighborhood-based modeling to deconvolve the nature of NAs as \"biological\" (low/no expression) or technical (experimental errors). Applying to multiple cell line datasets and human tissue extracellular vesicle datasets, BIND excavated the NAs that indicated \"hallmark absence\" of unique proteins. This led to improvements in protein-protein interaction analysis and the identification of novel disease biomarkers. To facilitate its public accessibility, we compiled BIND into a web server that features functional online operations and interactive visualizations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the BIND server could deconvolve the NAs and improve the analyses of single-cell proteomics datasets. Overall, BIND delineates the biological significance of missing values rather than treating them as a burden, providing a critical perspective for understanding the complex proteome in various biological contexts.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=144 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/660508v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b7da8forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6df72borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e4812org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ada8f9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

D1-D2 also interacts with the terminal RGG domain in a manner that correlates with phase separation. In contrast, the internal IDR is neither necessary nor sufficient for phase separation.

Reduced Cl- and HCO- secretion due to dysfunctional CFTR results in a decrease in lung function and is the leading cause of morbidity in individuals with CF. Recent therapies, known as highly effective CFTR modulator therapy (HEMT), help improve the lung function in individuals with specific CF-causing mutations by enhancing the folding, trafficking, and gating of CFTR. However, variability in HEMT responsiveness leads to sub-optimal clinical outcomes in some people with CF undergoing modulator therapy. A potential strategy is to complement their function with a CFTR-independent mechanism. One possibility is the use of ion channel-forming small molecules such as amphotericin B, which has shown promise in restoring function and host defenses in CF airway disease models. Amphotericin B functions as a molecular prosthetic for CFTR and may thus complement CFTR modulators. Here we show that co-treatment of CF airway epithelia with HEMT and amphotericin B results in greater increases in both HCO- secretory flux and ASL pH compared to treatment with either agent alone. These findings suggest that co-administration of CFTR modulators and molecular prosthetics may provide additive therapeutic benefits for individuals with CF.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

This innate immune response drives actin cytoskeleton remodeling and the formation of TNT-like structures, promoting intercellular transfer of -Syn from neurons to microglia. Additionally, neuronal cells transfer damaged mitochondria to microglia, where they undergo lysosome-mediated degradation.

In the studies described herein, we evaluated their role in influencing chemotherapy as well as in immunotherapy using colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line-derived 3D tumor constructs. Our initial efforts centered on common chemotherapeutic agents utilized in CRC. However, while the presence of fibroblasts often did influence chemotherapy efficacy, a clear and consistent increase or decrease in efficacy was not obvious.

There are numerous components and pathways involved in tumorigenesis and tumor-immune cell interactions, and the crosstalk between fibroblasts and immune cells like NK cells is still not well-defined. Fibroblasts have been documented to be a major player with respect to immune modulation and understanding this in greater detail can elucidate more options for anti-tumor immunity. Specifically, we used an extracellular matrix-based hydrogel platform to generate 3D CRC constructs to evaluate how fibroblasts affect tumor cell viability in presence and absence of NK cells. In general, fibroblasts aid the tumor cells in our models.

However, the mechanisms that govern the spatial coordination and substrate specificity of this pathway remain incompletely understood. This study determines the role of the scaffolding protein RACK1 (Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1) in orchestrating glucagon signaling to regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis. Methods: RACK1 was acutely deleted in mouse liver and primary hepatocytes. Metabolic phenotypes were assessed by glucose, pyruvate, and insulin tolerance tests, and hepatocyte glucose production assays. Protein interactions were analyzed with co-immunoprecipitation, GST pulldown, and proximity ligation assays. Subcellular localization and signaling events were studied by Western blot, confocal microscopy, and fractionation. Functional rescue was performed by hepatic expression of a constitutively active PKA catalytic subunit (PKAcW196R). Results: Acute hepatic RACK1 deficiency caused fasting hypoglycemia, impaired gluconeogenesis, and improved glucose and pyruvate tolerance without affecting insulin signaling. RACK1 directly bound GCGR, PKA regulatory (RII) and catalytic (PKAc) subunits, and CREB, functioning as a dual-compartment scaffold assembling GCGR/PKA complexes at the plasma membrane and PKAc/CREB complexes in the nucleus. Loss of RACK1 impaired PKAc translocation, CREB phosphorylation, and gluconeogenic gene expression. These defects were rescued by PKAcW196R expression. Overexpression of RACK1 WD1-2 and WD3-4 domains, which mediate PKA and GCGR interactions, similarly disrupted PKA signaling and gluconeogenesis.

Sequence alignment with human TG revealed strong conservation of hormonogenic tyrosines and cysteine residues, underscoring their structural significance in both species. We generated a PDB model for TGPM using the Swiss Model program for homology modeling. The full-length sea lamprey TG was subsequently aligned with full-length human TG through the Matchmaker command in UCSF ChimeraX, revealing a consistent structural overlap across all four regions (I, II, III, IV), highlighting their evolutionary conservation. Additionally, we identified a second sea lamprey TG transcript, TGPM1746, which begins with the TG type 1-10 module and extends to the carboxyl terminus, exhibiting high homology with TGPM except in region III.\n\nWe also present an evolutionary model proposing that nidogen, a protein containing TG type 1 modules, may have been the precursor to TG. Through genetic rearrangements and duplication events, a proto-TG likely emerged, influenced by environmental factors such as ionizing radiation. Structural modifications led to the loss of nidogens globular regions, resulting in a secretory proto-TG containing three TG type 1 modules. Successive duplications expanded the TG structure, ultimately forming TG 11 type 1 modules, closely resembling the ancestral TG in Petromyzon marinus.

Adaptive hypotheses posit that DR extends lifespan because organisms reallocate resources from reproduction to survival (\"disposable soma\") or recycle cellular waste to maximize either their immediate reproduction (\"nutrient recycling\") or survival (\"clean cupboards\"). We developed an experimental paradigm that tricks Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes into increasing their reproductive effort under DR via food odour, thus allowing us to test these hypotheses. We found that experimentally increased reproduction under DR does not affect immediate or long-term survival benefits compared to DR animals that did not reproduce, thus refuting all three adaptive hypotheses. Our data suggest that a large part of suppressed fertility under DR is a result of organisms refraining from producing offspring in a poor environment. We developed a model based on Hamiltonian forces of selection to show that lifespan extension under DR evolves because DR suppresses fertility, directly increasing selection against mortality in DR environment.

S.; Lange, B.; Aldamak, B.; Reuel, N.

However, while high iterations boost performance, current workflows are slow and costly due to their reliance on cell-based cloning and expression limiting the number of iterations they can practically implement. To address this problem and enable rapid, high-iteration, active learning-guided protein engineering, we present a novel combinatorial mutagenesis workflow that uses small (~20-40 bp) mutagenic annealed-oligo fragments and cell-free expression to rapidly and conveniently screen protein variants in <9 hours. The annealed-oligo's small size is >80% reduction from current shuffling strategies, minimizing the likelihood of needing to include nearby mutation sites on the same fragment and having the combinatorial increase of unique oligos needed to cover the design space. The oligos are also simple to prepare in bulk for the whole engineering campaign, eliminating the need for PCR mutagenesis or ordering of costly commercial genes each screening round. Our workflow was validated by screening superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) and uricase mutants assembled using three, five, and ten fragments. We observed high sequence fidelity, predictable mutant activities, and compatibility with automation demonstrating our workflows generality, reliability, and utility for protein engineering.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

A comprehensive understanding of the mechanical interactions between the IPP and penile tissues is crucial for improving surgical outcomes and device performance. This study aims to develop and validate preclinical testbeds, including a polymer-based benchtop model and a finite element (FE) model, to replicate the biomechanical behaviour of penile tissues during IPP inflation. Methods: A polymer-based benchtop model was developed using porous and non-porous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels, with the porous PVA mimicking the spongy corpus cavernosum (CC) and the non-porous PVA representing the tunica albuginea (TA) and fascial layers. IPP inflation tests were conducted on three benchtop models and three human penile tissue segments. Additionally, 3D FE simulations of IPP inflation were performed on both the benchtop and human tissue models for comparative analysis. Results: The experimental results demonstrated strong agreement between the human penile tissues, the benchtop model, and the FE simulations, validating the preclinical testbeds. Parametric studies using the FE model revealed that CC layer size and stiffness significantly influence IPP inflation mechanics, highlighting the importance of these factors in device performance. These validated preclinical testbeds provide a robust platform for optimising IPP design, guiding surgical procedures, and mitigating post-implantation complications associated. Conclusion: The developed benchtop and FE models effectively replicate human penile tissue responses to IPP inflation and can serve as valuable preclinical tools for device manufacturers and clinicians. Their use may enhance surgical decision-making and improve long-term IPP outcomes.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

R.; Bal, R.; Cattagni, T.; Nordez, A.", "abstract": "This study investigates the neuromechanical characteristics associated with expert drummers ability to achieve unilateral ankle oscillation frequencies of up to 10 Hz, surpassing known limits for lower-body movements. Eighteen experienced drummers performed trials at various frequencies, using a protocol combining H-reflex measurement, motion analysis, and electromyography. Our findings closely parallel neuromechanical signatures observed in ankle tremors, with an average movement frequency of 6.3 Hz (SD: 0.5 Hz), and a modulation range of 5.5-7.3 Hz. Oscillatory behavior may result from the interplay between muscle-tendon mechanics and stretch reflex loops. At 6.3 Hz, soleus activation lasts 56.2 ms, shortening by 2.5 ms/Hz (p < 0.001), while tibialis anterior activation lasts 52.7 ms, decreasing by 5.3 ms/Hz (p < 0.001). The latency between ankle dorsiflexion and soleus activation is 48.5 ms at 6.3 Hz, matching the short-latency stretch reflex, and decreases by 11 ms/Hz (p<0.001). Limiting factors for the drummers maximal frequency are soleus and tibialis anterior co-activation, reducing ankle movement, and high levels of activation in hip and back muscles, associated with discomfort and pain. Drummers with higher maximal frequencies (above 7.5 Hz, n = 6) show shorter tibialis anterior activation durations (34.3 ms vs. 53.2 ms, p = 0.0013) and reduced tensor fascia latae activation (6.2% vs. 21.0%, p = 0.0135). These findings highlight phenomenological similarities between the ankle technique and physiological tremors, in terms of neuromechanical timing and oscillatory patterns. Precise tibialis anterior timing and relaxed proximal muscle activation are critical for performance, while injury prevention strategies remain essential.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study provides a neuromechanical analysis of expert metal drummers producing exceptionally high-frequency ankle movements--up to 10 Hz--that surpass known limits for lower-body movements, and draws parallels with physiological action tremors. By comparing their motor patterns to those reported in tremor literature, this work highlights the role of neuromuscular timing and mechanical adaptations, such as stretch reflex dynamics and muscle-tendon interactions. The findings demonstrate that precise tibialis anterior timing and relaxed proximal muscles are critical for performance, while stabilization demands increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in the lower back and hips. These insights bridge performance science, biomechanics, and injury prevention, offering valuable perspectives for optimizing high-frequency movements in music, sports, and rehabilitation.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify chronic tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) signalling as a key driver of neurogenic dysregulation via a previously unrecognized type I interferon (IFN) autocrine/paracrine loop in human hippocampal progenitor cells (HPCs). Using a human in vitro neurogenesis model, single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional T cell migration assays, we show that TNF- induces a robust type I IFN response in HPCs, promoting chemokine and CXCR3-dependent T cell recruitment and suppressing neurogenesis. This inflammatory signalling cascade drives a fate switch in HPCs from a neurogenic trajectory towards an immune-defensive phenotype, with critical implications for infectious and inflammatory disease pathogenesis. These findings uncover a key inflammatory checkpoint regulating human AHN and highlight potential therapeutic targets to restore neurogenesis in chronic inflammatory states.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We investigated 50 healthy participants to determine how fluctuations in pre-stimulus brain activity influence single-trial TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). We developed a novel automated source-level TEP extraction method using individualized spatiotemporal priors that is robust against poor single trial signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and ongoing oscillations. TEP and MEP amplitudes were predicted with linear mixed-effects models based on pre-stimulation EEG band-powers (theta to gamma), while accounting for temporal drifts (within-session trends), coil control, and inter-subject differences. We found that higher pre-stimulus sensorimotor alpha, beta, and gamma power were each associated with larger TEPs, indicating a more excitable cortical state. Increases in alpha and gamma power immediately before stimulation specifically predicted larger MEPs, reflecting increased corticospinal excitability. These results reveal relationships between ongoing oscillatory brain states and TMS response amplitudes, identifying EEG biomarkers of high- and low-excitability states. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the feasibility of single-trial source-level TMS-EEG analysis and shows that spontaneous alpha-, beta-, and gamma-band oscillations modulate motor cortical and corticospinal responsiveness.

Hyperscanning analysis based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which measures inter-brain synchrony (IBS) during dyadic interaction, offers a novel avenue to address these challenges. However, prior studies on ASD have reported inconsistent findings, primarily focusing on intra-regional synchronization while overlooking cross-regional network dynamics. To bridge this gap, we proposed an interpretable graph neural network (GNN) model to systematically identify ASD-specific IBS modular network between child-caregiver dyads during naturalistic cooperative puzzle-solving and free-talking tasks. We identified distinctive key IBS sub-networks for the cooperative puzzle-solving task and free-talking task, with the frontal eye field (FEF) of caregivers, the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the motor region of children highlighted. Furthermore, the key IBS sub-networks were found to be able to predict multiple domains of the core ASD symptoms. By integrating hyperscanning with GNN-driven analysis, this work uncovers task-dependent inter-brain neural mechanisms underlying social difficulties in ASD. These findings advance the field by proposing a data-driven framework to identify IBS biomarkers tied to clinical profiles, paving the way for personalized interventions that integrate computational neuroscience with clinical practice.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Perceptual illusions are widely used to study brain processing, and are essential for elucidating underlying function. Successful brain models should then also be able to reproduce these illusions. Some of the most successful models for vision are several variants of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). These models can classify images with human-level accuracy, and many behavioral and activation measurements correlate well with humans and animals. For several networks it was also shown that they can reproduce some human illusions. However, this was typically done for a limited number of networks. In addition, it remains unclear whether the presence of illusions is linked to either how accurate or brain-like the DNNs are. Here, we consider the scintillating grid illusion, to which two DNNs have been shown to respond as if they are impacted by the illusion. We develop a measure for measuring Illusion Strength based on model activation correlations, which takes into account the difference in Illusion Strength between illusion and control images. We then compare the Illusion Strength to both model performance (top-1 ImageNet), and how well the model explains brain activity (Brain-score). We show that the illusion was measurable in a wide variety of networks (41 out of 51). However, we do not find a strong correlation between Illusion Strength and Brain-Score, nor performance. Some models have strong illusion scores but not Brain-Score, or vice-versa, but no model does both well. Finally, this differs strongly between model types, particularly between convolutional and transformer-based architectures, with transformers having low illusion scores. Overall, our work shows that Illusion Strength measures an important metric to consider for assessing brain models, and that some models could still be missing out on some processing important for brain functioning.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We found that DNA metabarcoding outperformed mechanical sorting in detecting higher overall prey and rare prey species occurrences, uncovering higher prey diversity. The study revealed that tigers were subsisting mainly on wild prey such as sambar and chital. However, domestic cattle contributed the highest relative prey biomass to their diet. Our findings demonstrate that DNA metabarcoding is an efficient, effective and powerful approach that overcomes several of the previously identified biases of the mechanical sorting approach and provides an accessible and particularly useful tool for carnivore dietary studies based on non-invasive samples.

One of the main problems plaguing tomato production is infection by populations of root-knot nematodes (RKNs; Meloidogyne spp.) that can evade or suppress (break) resistance mediated by the Mi-1 gene, which has been introgressed into most processing tomato cultivars. In this study, we evaluate fourteen Meloidogyne spp. populations collected from fields across the state of California that can complete their life cycle on Mi-1 tomato cultivars. One of these populations was identified as M. javanica and the others as M. incognita. All RKN populations developed and reproduced on Mi-1 tomato cultivar Celebrity. Although we did not observe differences in gall index among populations when studied together in greenhouse conditions, significant quantitative variation in reproduction factor values was apparent among them. Several pathogens and parasites display geographical gradients in aggressiveness and we identified a negative correlation between populations' latitudes-of-origin and reproduction factors. This suggests that populations of these thermophilic RKN species from lower latitudes tended to have evolved higher levels of aggressiveness on Mi-1 tomato, which may be linked to warmer temperatures throughout the year. Finally, populations with relatively low reproduction factor values still showed significant differences in the phenotypes of the galls they induced. Our results showed that Meloidogyne populations evolved genetic variation in aggressiveness along a latitudinal gradient in Californian processing tomato agroecosystems, which may have implications for managing these important crop pests.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Computed from the joint site frequency spectrum for two populations, {psi} uses shared genetic variants to measure the difference in the amount of genetic drift experienced by the populations, associating excess drift with greater distance from the origin of the range expansion. Although {psi} has been successfully applied in natural populations, its statistical properties have not been well understood. In this paper, we define {Psi} as a random variable originating from a coalescent process in a two-population demography. For samples consisting of a pair of diploid genomes, one from each of two populations, we derive expressions for moments E[{Psi}k] for standard parameterizations of bottlenecks during a founder event. For the expectation E[{Psi}], we identify parameter combinations that represent distinct demographic scenarios yet yield the same value of E[{Psi}]. We also show that the variance V[{Psi}] increases with the time since the bottleneck, bottleneck severity, and size of the ancestral population. For a sample containing many SNPs, the central limit theorem allows us to approximate the distribution of the observed value of the {psi} index conditional on the demographic history. Finally, we analyze the values of E[{Psi}] computed from existing demographic models of Drosophila melanogaster and compare them with empirically computed {psi}.

They have been extensively studied in clinical bacteria, but their evolutionary role in phytopathogens remains underexplored. Here, we analysed complete genomes of Xanthomonas species to investigate the origin, distribution, and functional dynamics of integrons in this genus. We found that 93% of genomes harboured integrons. The integron-integrase gene intI was predominantly located downstream of ilvD, indicating an ancestral acquisition of integrons, predating diversification within the genus. Phylogenetic analyses support vertical inheritance of intI, with the exception of rare horizontal gene transfer events, notably in X. arboricola. Despite their widespread presence, full-length intI genes and active integron platforms are only retained in some species, especially X. campestris, which shows high integron gene cassette variability and functional integron activity. In contrast, species such as X. cissicola and X. phaseoli exhibit widespread inI inactivation, likely occurring early in their divergence, leading to more stable cassette arrays and conserved integron-associated phenotypes. The number and diversity of genes within cassette arrays varied significantly by species and, to a lesser extent, by the ecological context of plant host cultivation. While most cassettes encoded proteins without a known function, those with annotated roles were associated with stress response mechanism, competitive exclusion, and plant-associated functions. Together, our findings demonstrate that integrons in Xanthomonas likely originated from a single ancient acquisition event, preceding genus-wide speciation, and have co-evolved with Xanthomonas pathovars as they adapted to distinct plant hosts.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Our study investigated these questions using a cross-cultural gating paradigm, in which Chinese and Arab listeners (n=25/group) judged the emotion communicated by acoustic events that varied in duration (200 milliseconds to the full expression) and form (vocalizations or prosody expressed in listeners native, second or foreign language). Accuracy was higher for vocalizations overall, but listeners were markedly more efficient to form stable categorical representations of the speakers emotion from vocalizations (M = 417ms) than native prosody (M = 765ms). Language experience enhanced recognition of emotional prosody expressed by native/ingroup speakers for some listeners (Chinese) but not all (Arab), emphasizing the dynamic interplay of socio-cultural factors and stimulus quality on prosody recognition which occurs over a more sustained time window.

Improved colour learning has been demonstrated using differential conditioning with reward-aversion paradigms in insects like wasps, bumblebees, and honeybees, where substances that induce strong aversion, such as quinine, enable more accurate discrimination. Although learning outcomes of differential conditioning are closely tied to the perceived reward and aversion, few studies have compared the role of negative reinforcements in shaping associations, and their relevance across insect groups. In our study, we compare the role of aversive substances for differential in the hummingbird hawkmoth, Macroglossum stellatarum, a diurnal moth that relies on vision for foraging. Tying to previous learning studies in insects, we paired a sugar-rewarded target with a distractor that was paired with either quinine, salt, citric acid, water, or was presented with no aversive substance. Learning outcomes were compared by inverting a strong colour preference between perceptually close or distant colour pairs, to provide tasks with disparate challenges. Contrary to results from other insect species, we found that moths trained with quinine were worse at switching preferences between similar colours compared to training with citric acid and appetitive-only differential conditioning. We also show that quinine interferes with sucrose perception, potentially impairing target acquisition during training. Additionally, we link differences in learning arising from the negative reinforcements to their impact on exploration during foraging.

In comparing two populations of tea tortrix moth, Adoxophyes honmai, we found the absence of a cost of resistance but also noted differences in digestive enzyme gene expression. This raised the possibility that insecticide resistance coevolved with enhanced digestive capabilities, potentially offsetting putative costs of resistance. This study explored gene transcript patterns that may influence how traits manifest spatially and temporally, evaluating potential connections between digestion and the costs of resistance. We found that our resistant larvae had constitutively greater transcript levels of multiple putative digestive genes as well as a marker of resistance, CYP9A170. The putative digestive genes were expressed mostly in the digestive tract, whereas the tissue-specific pattern of CYP9A170 expression was strain-dependent. For most genes, the difference in expression between susceptible and resistant larvae remained consistent throughout development. Interestingly, the expression of an ABC transporter was upregulated in response to tebufenozide exposure, but only in the resistant larvae. A comparison of A. honmai transcriptomes suggests that the majority of differentially expressed genes between populations may not be directly contributing to resistance, but rather microevolutionary variations specific to individual populations. Future studies on fitness costs of resistance should consider other physiological systems and their interactions with direct mechanisms of resistance.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Using an ANOVA-based modeling strategy, we precisely quantified the relative contributions of stimulus, task, and their interaction in explaining representational variance across the cortical hierarchy. Our results show that stimulus effects account for the overwhelming majority of explainable representational variance across the ventral visual system: > 95 percent in V1 and V2, and > 90 percent in higher-level visual cortex. In prefrontal cortex, the relative contributions reverse: task effects dominate stimulus effects, accounting for 80 percent of explainable representational variance.

The objective of this study was to understand the mechanism of action of BoNT/A1 in cultured human sensory neurons and assess, using RNA sequencing, the transcriptomic consequences of BoNT/A1 treatment. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors the expression of key targets, including SNAP25, SV2C, & CALCA, was validated by mining existing transcriptomic datasets as well as immunohistochemistry. Cultured dissociated human DRG neurons treated with BoNT/A1 were used to examine cleavage of SNAP25, release of CGRP and transcriptomic changes after BoNT/A1 treatment. SV2C was found to be widely expressed in human DRG neurons in a pattern that completely overlapped with CGRP expression. Consistent with this finding, BoNT/A1 disrupted SNARE protein complexes in human DRG neurons as demonstrated by SNAP-25 cleavage in most somatosensory neurons and a reduction in capsaicin-evoked CGRP release, indicating impaired vesicle fusion. Moreover, Bulk RNA sequencing experiments revealed downregulated expression of a large subset of genes responsible for neurotransmitter and neuropeptide release from neurons suggesting a novel mechanism through which BoNT/A regulates neurotransmission.

Individual differences in sensitivity to social threats may leave certain people more vulnerable to stress and its harmful sequelae than others, and a growing body of research has found that stress sensitivity is reflected in neural activity throughout the threat network. However, few studies have investigated whether heightened neural sensitivity to social threats is related to acute changes in immune and neuroendocrine pathways relevant to health, particularly among those for whom the effects of stress may be especially impactful.\n\nMethodIn the current research, 52 adolescent females (MAge = 14.90, SD = 1.35) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study to examine brain activity and functional connectivity during a social evaluation task. Nearly half of the sample (n = 22) were identified as having a maternal history of depression. Blood samples were collected prior to the task, as well as 35 and 65 min. after the task began, and were used for transcriptional profiling.\n\nResultsThe primary analyses tested whether threat network activity and connectivity predicted the magnitude of change in gene expression from baseline to the follow-up time points. Results revealed robust shifts in expression of genes in innate immune pathways in response to the task (e.g., hypoxia inducible factor-1, interferon signaling). Although activity across the entire threat network was related to individual differences in gene expression, anterior cingulate cortex-insula and insula-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity were most consistently related to up- and down-regulation of immune pathways, respectively. These patterns were further moderated by differences in maternal depression history.\n\nConclusionResults demonstrate that individual differences in threat network activity may have important implications for biological responses to social threat among adolescent females. In turn, these findings both provide insights into neural signatures of social stress vulnerability and the biological pathways that may contribute to poorer health outcome among those most vulnerable to stress.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Although there is evidence that dividing attention across tasks impairs performance in various domains, the impact of attention on sensorimotor adaptation remains inconclusive, with some studies reporting deficits and others showing no effects. Because sensorimotor adaptation arises from the interaction of explicit and implicit processes, this discrepancy may reflect differential effects of attention on each process. Here, we investigate how divided attention influences implicit sensorimotor adaptation using an error-clamp paradigm, coupled with a random dot kinematogram (RDK) motion coherence discrimination task. We also assessed whether the timing of the secondary task affects error processing during sensorimotor adaptation by presenting the RDK either during the outward movement (coinciding with error feedback), or the inward movement (following error feedback). We observed that attentional manipulation influenced implicit sensorimotor adaptation only when the RDK was presented on the outward movement, not the inward movement. Remarkably, implicit sensorimotor adaptation was enhanced when attention was divided, compared to when attention was focused entirely on the adaptation task. This suggests that implicit sensorimotor adaptation is sensitive to attentional demand, particularly during the time window where error feedback is received.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

M.; Hahn, R.; Dempsey, M.; Hohmann, A.

Xylazine adulteration of fentanyl is associated with increased risk of lethal overdose and decreased efficacy of reversal by the MOR antagonist naloxone. Here we use whole body plethysmography in mice to show that xylazine produces profound respiratory depression at subanesthetic doses. Xylazine rapidly and dose-dependently suppressed minute ventilation, tidal volume, and respiratory frequency. These effects were dependent on -2 adrenergic receptors and were fully blocked by coadministration of the -2 adrenergic antagonist atipamezole. Atipamezole, administered alone, produced only modest reversal of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression. Xylazine, when combined with a dose of fentanyl with modest respiratory effects, suppressed breathing with greater efficacy than when administered alone. Strikingly, doses of naloxone sufficient to completely reverse fentanyl-induced respiratory depression were ineffective in reversing the respiratory suppression induced by xylazine-adulterated fentanyl. By contrast, combinations of naloxone with atipamezole rapidly and fully reversed the suppression of breathing induced by xylazine-adulterated fentanyl. Our results show that xylazine suppresses breathing via activation of -2 receptors, an effect enhanced by coadministration with the MOR agonist fentanyl. Respiratory suppression inflicted by the mixture of xylazine and fentanyl resisted reversal by naloxone but was fully reversible by subsequent coadministration of both naloxone and atipamezole. These observations have profound implications for the current opioid epidemic.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

These habitats exhibited extreme environmental conditions, including hypoxic waters, elevated temperature fluctuations and very acidic waters. Throughout the year, we recorded 17 fish species, including endangered and exotic taxa, across 36 ditches sampled in the Preto River microbasin. Species richness was higher during the Wet Period, likely due to increased hydrological connectivity with nearby streams. Although species richness was higher during the Wet Period, species composition did not differ between periods. Redundancy analysis revealed low explanation of environmental variables on community structure, while a significant positive correlation between spatial distance and community dissimilarity suggested dispersal limitation as a major structuring force. These findings highlight both the ecological relevance of artificial temporary habitats in fragmented landscapes and the requirement to integrate such environments into regional species inventories, especially as natural wetlands continue to decline.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

This topical amoxicillin paste is highly effective in halting lesions and has been used on tens of thousands of wild corals since 2019, but long-term survival rates of treated corals as well as the frequency of potential reinfections remained speculative. We fate-tracked thousands of corals treated for SCTLD in the Florida Keys across numerous species and two habitats (inshore patch reefs and offshore spur and groove) every two months, assessing health condition and providing additional treatments if necessary. After three years, 84% of corals remained alive. Inshore corals had higher survival rates than offshore corals, and there were species-specific differences in survival, with the boulder corals Montastraea cavernosa and Orbicella faveolata having higher survivorship than brain coral species. Across all treated corals, 36% remained disease-free for at least one year after the initial treatment, and an additional 18% remained disease-free if any new lesions were treated within three months after the initial treatment. Reinfection rates were influenced by both habitat and species, with inshore corals more likely to remain disease-free than offshore corals. Among the species assessed, Montastraea cavernosa was the most likely to remain disease free, while the brain corals Diploria labyrinthiformis and Colpophyllia natans were the most prone to reinfection.

D.; Adali, T.; Calhoun, V.", "abstract": "Understanding the dynamic intrinsic interactions between brain regions has been advanced by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), particularly through the connectivity analysis used to characterize reoccurring patterns in the brain known as brain states. However, previous studies have primarily focused on unimodal models, which can hinder optimal dynamic state estimation, especially in cognitive disorders, cases where there may be both structure and function disruption. To better estimate intrinsic brain interactions, it is important to account for the factors shaping this estimation not only in terms of time resolved variability of the connectivity but also regarding the underlying physical pathways between brain regions. However current approaches mostly use deterministic weighting of structural connectivity. To address this, we propose a flexible multimodal connectivity constrained independent component analysis (ICA) model, termed structural connectivity-informed dynamic state estimation (STRiDE), that enhances stability and sensitivity by leveraging white matter structural connectivity and dynamic functional connectivity information. Using this model, we decompose brain interactions into independent, reoccurring multimodal patterns or structural-functional states, guided by maximally independent structural connectivity priors derived from the group level data. We first evaluate our proposed model using a simulation pipeline, showing the approach works as design and improves sensitivity to group differences and enhances robustness to noise. Next, we applied the proposed multimodal model to real dataset including a cohort of subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC). Results demonstrated its potential to enhance group-differences in both connectivity domain and temporal dynamics parameters. Specifically results highlighted disruption within and between sensory and trans-modal domains, through a SZ vs HC comparison. Symptoms severity and cognitive scores statistical analysis specifies their significant association with default mode domain, offering insights into the disrupted functional and neural mechanisms underlying schizophrenia. In addition, temporal interplay of the estimated STRiDEs reveals that visual-related STRiDE is significantly impacted in SZ, regarding the speed of processing score, underscoring the link between visual system and speed of processing. In sum, the STRiDE approach provides a flexible way to link structural and functional connectivity at the network level and represents a general approach for studying multimodal dynamic patterns and leveraging these to study the typical and disordered brain.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Most approaches in the field use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for inference. Inferring timed phylogenetic trees using MCMC relies on a set of proposal distributions -- operators -- to explore different phylogenetic tree topologies, node ranks, and heights. However, inefficiencies in these proposal distributions limit the speed and scale with which phylodynamic analyses can be performed. Here, we introduce two classes of operators that allow scaling of phylodynamic analyses by reducing the time needed to reach convergence. We propose an improved proposal distribution to scale trees based on the intervals between consecutive nodes in the tree, and a set of operators informed by a pseudo parsimony score to explore different tree topologies. Contrary to already existing operators that make large changes to areas of the tree with no mutations at all, our new parsimony-focused operators target areas of the tree with many mutations. We first demonstrate the correctness of these proposal distributions using a well-calibrated simulation study. We then demonstrate the improvements of using the updated proposal distributions using a number of large real-world datasets, showing a substantial increase in effective sample size per hour across viral datasets as well as a reduction in the number of samples required for the MCMC chain to reach stationarity. Finally, we apply the operators to a 10,000-sequence H3N2 dataset including phylogeography and finish the analysis within two weeks. The operators are implemented in the TargetedBeast package, which is available as an open-source package for BEAST2 and a user-friendly graphical user interface.

What is the energy consumption of non-equilibrium brain computation, i.e., what is the cost of cognition? Previous literature has estimated the metabolic cost using neuroimaging measures of glucose consumption but complementary to these findings, here we directly estimate the computational costs by combining the new field of stochastic thermodynamics with whole-brain modelling. We developed the COCO (COst of COgnition) framework using an analytical expression quantifying the links between energy cost, non-equilibrium and information processing for any given brain state measured with neuroimaging. Importantly, this key relationship also holds at the level of individual brain regions. We used this to quantify the benefits of information processing on the highly anatomically, interconnected hierarchical systems of the brain. Crucially, in empirical neuroimaging data we demonstrate that the human brain uses significantly less energy overall than other mammals (including non-human primates and mice), suggestive of an evolutionary optimisation of the effectiveness of computation. Focusing on the cost of cognition, using large-scale human neuroimaging data of 970 healthy human participants, we show that the resting state uses significantly less energy that seven different cognitive tasks. Furthermore, different kinds of tasks require different amounts of non-equilibrium, information processing and energy consumption. We found that tasks requiring more distributed computation also use more energy. Overall, these results directly quantify the cost of cognition, i.e., the non-equilibrium and energetic demands of information processing, allowing a deeper understanding of how the brain compute in a way that is far more energy efficient than current generations of digital computers and artificial intelligence.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

R.; Fenton, A.; Brookes, L.; Rosa, G.; Sergeant, C.; Garner, T.", "abstract": "Novel parasite emergences are posing uncertain threats to wildlife communities worldwide. Because parasites typically infect multiple host species and interact with other parasites, the degree of threat posed by these emergences is known to depend both on host species composition and history of exposure to other parasites. What is not known is how these two factors, multi-host effects and multi-parasite effects, interact to shape the outcomes of parasite emergences. We experimentally investigated the outcomes of sequential emergences by two amphibian parasites of major concern to global biodiversity, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Ranavirus (Rv). Mimicking sequential Bd and Rv emergence in communities comprising either larval common toads (Bufo bufo), larval common frogs (Rana temporaria), or both host species, showed that host community composition influenced subsequent patterns of Bd and Rv infection much more than the presence of the other parasite. Bd prevalence varied predictably with host community composition; toads exhibited consistently higher Bd infection probabilities than frogs across all scenarios. Variation in community-level prevalence therefore was explained by differences in the relative abundance of toads. In contrast, community-level Rv prevalence was not consistently driven by a single host species. Going from single-host to two-host communities reversed relative Rv infection probabilities in frogs versus toads; when kept separately, frogs had a higher Rv infection probability than toads, but toads had a higher infection probability than frogs when the two species were co-housed. Host species composition can therefore alter multi-parasite infection dynamics not only through changes in the abundance of primary host species, but also through changes in which species appear to act as the primary hosts. These insights suggest that Bd-Rv dynamics in single-host scenarios may not reflect those occurring in natural multihost communities, and the observed context-dependency in the apparent primary host species for Rv highlights an overlooked factor potentially shaping biodiversity-disease relationships.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

The systematic comparison of the perceptual sensitivity to spatial vs temporal visuomotor mismatches is notoriously difficult. In this preregistered experiment, we addressed this question by using a continuous elliptical drawing task with a new, matched spatial (offset) vs temporal (delay) vs congruent manipulation of visual movement feedback along identical movement trajectories; and comparing detection performances during execution vs observation. The detection of deviations in visual movement feedback was significantly improved by action; especially at critical (near- threshold) mismatch levels.

This study compares host immune responses to the Delta and Omicron variants using RNA-seq data from infected primary human airway epithelial cells.

Structure prediction modelling in conjunction with functional genetic analysis indicates that it uses a periplasmic coiled-coil tube to transport molecules across the cell wall. Structure-guided genetic approaches identify MmpL5 mutations that alter bedaquiline transport; these mutations converge on a region in MmpL5 located in the lower portion of the periplasmic cavity, proximal to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane, suggesting a route for bedaquiline entry into the pump.

Our GWA study uncovered significant association between polymorphisms in genes involved in heparan sulfate synthesis and L. plantarum load. RNAi mediated knockdown of some of these genes resulted in reduced heparan sulfate synthesis and L. plantarum abundance. Mechanistically, heparan sulfate facilitates adhesion of L. plantarum to host epithelium and promotes biofilm formation.

This fitness advantage was accompanied by an increase in cell size, faster glucose depletion rates, and increased amylopectin degradation in the presence of glucose. In conclusion, rapid adaptive genetic diversification in B. thetaiotaomicron is induced and maintained in part by a complex nutritional environment.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

However, while the influence of sporulation temperature on spore behaviour has been widely studied, the data concerning the influence of other factors such as water activity (aw) is scarce. We reported that reducing the aw of the sporulation medium from the optimum (aw 0.99; Scontrol spores) to 0.98, using sodium chloride (Ssalt spores) increased their wet heat resistance, yet by unknown means. The present work aimed to examine the mechanism behind the increased wet heat resistance observed in the spores produced in the presence of high salinity. Crust morphogenetic protein CotY was required for the increased wet heat resistance observed in spores of Bacillus subtilis formed in the presence of salt. Interestingly, this protein was also related to increased H2O2 resistance. Proteomic analysis of coat extracts from Ssalt and Scontrol spores revealed markedly different protein profiles. Specifically, Ssalt spores displayed significant increase in abundance of proteins involved in redox homeostasis, structure of the coat and also, others involved in favouring or establish cross-linking. Increased cross-linking, such as disulfide bond formation in the coat and the cysteine-rich crust is known to influence resistance to both agents. Furthermore, deletion of CotY increased DPH lipid probe mobility regardless of sporulation condition, indicating that it plays an active role in stabilizing the IM. Therefore, all the presented data suggested that increased coat cross-link directly or indirectly related to CotY in Ssalt grants enhanced wet heat resistance by protecting the IM, which was supported by DPA release data under lethal heat stress. This work advances our understanding of how the coat modulates resistance in bacterial spores, helping develop effective control strategies against problematic spore populations due to soil salinization.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

W.; Bernhardt, T. G.", "abstract": "Most bacteriophages lyse their host cell to release progeny virions. Double-stranded DNA phages typically promote host lysis using a holin-endolysin system. Holins form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane allowing endolysins access to the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, which they degrade to weaken the cell envelope and promote osmotic lysis. Phages that infect Proteobacteria also encode a spanin in their lysis cassette that functions to disrupt the host outer membrane. The spanin-requirement for cell lysis provided the first clue that the proteobacterial outer membrane confers mechanical rigidity to the cell envelope. Corynebacteria and mycobacteria also build an outer membrane, but it is made of mycolic acids instead of lipopolysaccharides. Here, we investigated whether the mycomembrane presents a mechanical barrier to phage-induced lysis of corynebacteria. In addition to annotated holin and endolysin genes, mycobacteriophages and corynephages were found to encode a membrane protein we call LysZ in their lysis cassettes. Deletion of lysZ in the corynephage Cog blocked lysis of its host Corynebacterium glutamicum. Surprisingly, disruption of the host mycomembrane did not correct this phenotype. Instead, a genetic analysis revealed that blocking synthesis of membrane-anchored glycopolymers called lipomannans/lipoarabinomannans (LM/LAMs) can restore plaque formation when LysZ is inactivated. This genetic system also identified the likely flippase that transports decaprenyl-linked mannose units to the extracellular side of the membrane for polymerization into LM/LAM. Overall, our results indicate that lipoglycans like LM/LAMs play roles in mechanically stabilizing bacterial envelopes and that phages use LysZ-like factors to overcome this barrier to promote lysis.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

The prognosis of peri-implantitis treatment is compromised by the resistance of well-organized and mature bacterial biofilms. Thus, early diagnosis of a pathogenic biofilm would enable treatment at a prognostically favourable stage. However, relatively little is known about how the microbial constitution of the biofilm changes during disease development. The aim of this cross-sectional study was therefore to identify peri-implant taxonomic and functional biomarkers that reliably indicate peri-implantitis using paired data from full length 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (full-16S) and metatranscriptomics (RNAseq). Disease signatures were identified using 24 healthy and 24 peri-implantitis-associated biofilm samples from 32 patients. The taxonomic measurements were validated with 68 additional full-16S samples from another 40 patients. Both full-16S and RNAseq revealed significant differences between healthy and peri-implantitis samples, with respect to both the microbiome and functional profiles. A shift from aerotolerant Gram-positive bacteria to anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria was observed in peri-implantitis. Distinct metabolic pathways were expressed in healthy and peri-implantitis samples. Our results, based on paired taxonomic and functional profiles, provide for the first time important insights into the complex peri-implant biofilm ecology related to amino acid metabolism. Integrating taxonomic and functional information improved the predictive ability (AUC = 0.85) of the machine learning models and revealed diagnostic biomarkers with large effect sizes (Cohens d > 0.8). Primary biomarkers included health-associated Streptococcus, Rothia species and enzymes associated with peri-implantitis (urocanate hydratase, tripeptide aminopeptidase, NADH:ubiquinone reductase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase - mostly expressed by Fusobacteriia and Bacteroidia). Thus, biofilm profiling at these two molecular levels reveals highly predictive disease biomarkers and provide the basis for developing early diagnostics and individualized therapy approaches for peri-implant diseases.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

MmpE utilizes two nuclear localization signals, RRR20-22 and RRK460-462, to enter the host cell nucleus, where it binds to the promoter region of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, thereby inhibiting host inflammatory gene expression. Additionally, MmpE represses the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which arrests phagosome maturation. These actions collectively facilitate immune suppression and promote mycobacterial survival in macrophages and in mice.

C. difficile has been classified into five classical phylogenetic clades (C1 to C5) and five cryptic clades (C-I to C-V), reflecting its extensive genome plasticity. In addition, C. difficile spores are considered essential for the onset, persistence and transmission of the disease, and their exosporium layer has hair-like projections formed by the BclA-family of proteins (BclA1, BclA2 and BclA3). Previous work in C1 and C2 strains has demonstrated that the absence of these proteins affects spore germination, pathogenesis, persistence, and recurrence of CDI. Nevertheless, the conservation of BclAs across different C. difficile clades remains unclear. In this work, genomics analysis in more than 25,000 C. difficile genomes revealed that the prevalence and variability of the BclAs was not conserved across classical and cryptic clades. The most represented clade on the dataset was C1, where roughly 50% of the genomes possessed all three bclA genes. Pseudogenization of bclA1 or all bclAs was observed in C2 and C3, respectively. Additionally, the absence of bclA1 in C4 and of both bclA1 & bclA3 in C5, further demonstrates the divergence of BclAs among C. difficile clades. Subsequent analysis revealed high variability in the central collagen-like region (CLR) of all three BclAs, and a highly conserved bclA1 pseudogenization event in most members of C2. Overall, the extensive variability of bclA, attributed to the CLR, prevalence of a bclA1 pseudogenization and complete absence of bclAs in certain clades, is likely to impact spore morphogenesis and pathogenesis across different C. difficile clades.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

They bind Pumilio Response Elements (PREs) on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to modulate mRNA stability and translation. PUMs have been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including stem cell maintenance, neurogenesis, and cell cycle regulation. They have also been reported to negatively regulate innate immunity genes and to participate in viral RNA sensing. Previous high-throughput interactome studies revealed that PUMs bind SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We found that SARS-CoV-2 transcripts contain multiple conserved PREs, some of which are preferentially bound by PUM2. Surprisingly, altering PUM levels does not affect the production of progeny virions. However, depletion of PUM1 slightly increases intracellular viral RNA levels, suggesting that PUM1 either plays a mild antiviral role against SARS-CoV-2 or regulates a host factor that promotes viral replication. Notably, PUM1 also negatively regulates innate immunity gene expression both at steady state and during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings support a complex immunomodulatory role for PUM1, acting both as a negative regulator of innate immunity genes and a mild inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA accumulation. However, in cell culture, these roles appear negligible based on viral progeny output. Whether the multiple PREs found in the SARS-CoV-2 genome contribute to evasion of PUM1 activity remains an open question.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

We report that RSV IBs protect viral RNA from the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway, a critical antiviral defense mechanism that cleaves viral and cellular RNAs. RSV infection did not activate the OAS-RNase L pathway, and ectopically activated RNase L did not suppress viral replication. In RSV-infected cells, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was efficiently sequestered within liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)-mediated IBs, rendering its detection challenging. LLPS perturbation caused dsRNA release from IBs into the cytosol. dsRNA extracted from infected cells, which lacked LLPS shielding, triggered OAS-RNase L pathway activation. Thus, LLPS-driven IBs structurally sequester viral RNA, facilitating RSV to evade RNase-dependent genomic RNA degradation mediated by the OAS-RNase L antiviral pathway.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

The reasons why recombination suppression evolves around these loci remain poorly understood. Here, we propose that one reason may be that loci under balancing selection facilitate the emergence of pseudo-overdominance--a phenomenon under which linked recessive deleterious mutations in repulsion mimic overdominance. Pseudo-overdominance arises when linkage disequilibrium gradually builds up between recessive deleterious mutations, often due to strong genetic linkage and genetic drift. Once complementary haplotypes form, homozygous and recombinant offspring are selected against because they carry homozygous recessive deleterious mutations. Using individual-based simulations, we demonstrate here that the presence of loci under balancing selection eases the establishment of pseudo-overdominance, by facilitating the maintenance of recessive deleterious mutations and linkage disequilibrium in their flanking regions. We further show that, under some conditions, such resulting pseudo-overdominant zones can ultimately lead to selection for crossing-over suppression around permanently heterozygous loci, preventing the creation of unfit homozygous recombinant offspring.

Here we present the Proximity Network Assay (PNA), a DNA-based method for constructing three-dimensional nanoscale maps of 155 proteins in single cells without the use of optics. PNA employs barcoded antibodies and in situ rolling circle amplification to generate >40,000 spatial nodes per cell, which are linked through proximity-dependent gap-fill ligation and decoded by DNA sequencing, forming single cell Proximity Networks. At an estimated spatial resolution of ~50 nm, PNA captures single-cell protein abundance, self-clustering, and colocalization, validating established cell membrane protein interactions.

However, the eukaryotic species in genome databases are not sufficient as there exist numerous unculturable eukaryotes inside metagenomes. These limitations hinder functional and evolutionary analyses of eukaryotes across distinct environmental samples. To overcome these limitations, we created Euktect, a deep-learning-based toolbox for reliable, alignment-free classification of eukaryotic DNA sequences across different phylogenetic levels from metagenome datasets. Euktect achieves high accuracy in extraction of eukaryotic sequences longer than 500bp from the assembled contigs of metagenomes, significantly outperforming existing methods. Furthermore, we developed an algorithm that integrates Euktects predictions with existing tools to refine metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), substantially increasing the yield of high-quality eukaryotic MAGs for the downstream analysis. Beyond eukaryotic detection, Euktect incorporates two specialized models: a high-precision classifier for fungal phyla, and a hierarchical classifier that accurately identifies sequences from specific fungal genera (e.g., Candida) in diverse metagenomic samples. Significantly, this framework enables prediction of host disease status (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) by linking eukaryotic sequence identification to clinical phenotypes through machine learning models. Collectively, Euktect enables accurate reconstruction and functional annotation of eukaryotic genomes from metagenomes at large scale, thereby empowering the comprehensive utilization of sequenced eukaryotic species for downstream evolutionary and clinical research.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

K.; Snipas, M.", "abstract": "Connexin (Cx) hemichannels represent a growing facet of Cx research. Hemichannels are hexamers of Cx subunits that are historically thought of as substrates of intercellular gap junction channels formed when two hemichannels from neighboring cells dock. Hemichannels, however, can function in the absence of docking and have been shown to play important roles in transmembrane signaling. There are 21 different Cx isoforms in humans and a host of disease-causing mutations have been identified. Although Cxs constitute large-pore channels, they can differ substantially in their conductance and permeability characteristics, thereby affecting the nature of signals that are transmitted. In this study, we present a methodology for quantifying and comparing the permeabilities of hemichannels formed by different Cx isoforms using a combination of fluorescence imaging, electrophysiological recordings and mathematical modeling. Fluorescence imaging, coupled with mathematical modeling based on Fick's law and/or the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation, enables estimation of tracer diffusion rates. These data are integrated with independently obtained electrophysiological measurements of hemichannel activity into a unified statistical model based on the likelihood ratio test. Simulation-based analyses demonstrate that our approach can reliably detect ~2-fold differences in hemichannel permeability using datasets of moderate size. Crucially, this approach requires only a minimal amount of time-intensive electrophysiological recording, leveraging higher-throughout fluorescence measurements, which can be further streamlined using AI-based tools for automated cell detection and data extraction. We apply this method to compare the permeability of hemichannels formed by wild-type Cx26 and a pore-lining variant, Cx26*A49E. Our results show a significant increase in DAPI permeability in Cx26*A49E hemichannels, consistent with previous findings. This methodology can be extended to assess the permeabilities of other large-pore channels.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Single-cell RNA-seq analyses have identified two distinct stromal cell populations in the mouse uterus: superficial and deep stromal cells. However, their functional specialization remains unresolved. Here, we show that mice lacking methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14), a core enzyme of the m6A methyltransferase complex, exhibit a selective depletion of superficial stromal cells while preserving deep stromal cells. This genetic model allowed us to investigate the physiological role of superficial stromal cells in uterine function. Paralleled by the aberrant development and loss of superficial stromal cells, Mettl14 deletion impaired embryo implantation and decidualization. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that Mettl14 deficiency disrupts hormonal signaling by upregulating estrogen (E2)-responsive genes and downregulating progesterone (P4)-responsive genes, resulting in aberrant development and loss of superficial stromal cells. Mechanistically, Mettl14 ablation reduces m6A methylation in the 3'-UTR of Esr1 mRNA, thereby impairing m6A-dependent mRNA degradation and elevating ESR1 expression, which amplifies E2 signaling. This study underscores the essential role of METTL14 in maintaining the superficial stromal cell population required for embryo implantation by regulating Esr1 mRNA stability through m6A modification.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

To uncover its roles in human haematopoiesis, we developed high-resolution ex vivo tools that track both division and fate commitment of individual primary human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We show that human HSPCs display a clonal memory of division, as cells descending from the same ancestor cell divide synchronously over multiple generations. In parallel, HSPCs inherit a clonal memory of fate commitment, independently of lineage identity. Both forms of clonal memory persist over at least two divisions, across different HSPC commitment stages and cell culture conditions. In contrast, malignant haematopoiesis exhibits lower synchronicity, revealing a disruption of clonal memory in leukemic cells. Epigenetic remodelling using a bromodomain inhibitor partially restores the clonal memory in division in leukemic HSPCs, highlighting the plasticity of this trait and its potential for therapeutic modulation. Our findings position clonal memory as a key regulator of human haematopoietic stem cell behaviour. Demonstrating that clonal memory can be modulated opens new avenues for tuning cell heterogeneity in healthy and pathological tissues.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Cancer cell metabolism is commonly reprogrammed to favour glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, even under aerobic conditions, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. A key enzyme implicated in this shift is phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), which catalyses the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate. The human enzyme is dependent on cofactor 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate which can phosphorylate and thereby activate the enzyme at histidine 11 (H11). A recently characterised moonlighting activity of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), in its monomeric or dimeric forms, leads to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphorylation of PGAM1 at the same position. Crucially, this phosphorylation is dependent on prior tyrosine 119 (Y119) phosphorylation of PGAM1 by Src kinase, itself activated by oncogenic growth factors. Using AlphaFold 3 (AF3), this study models the conformational changes induced by PGAM1 Y119 phosphorylation and investigates the molecular basis for its role in facilitating PEP-dependent phosphorylation at H11. Structural comparisons suggest that Y119 phosphorylation induces rearrangement of the C-terminal tail of PGAM1, opening the catalytic site around H11 to enable binding of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Use of molecular docking (Webina, SwissDock, and DiffDock) found that AF3 generated models of PGAM1 with Y119 phosphorylation showed enhanced binding of PEP in comparison to non-phosphorylated PGAM1. However, extensive protein-protein docking (ClusPro, AF3 multimer generation) failed to identify configurations of PGAM1 and PKM2 where catalytic sites were proximal. Overall, this study supports a model in which phosphorylation of PGAM1 at Y119 enables access to the active site for PEP, thus enhancing its enzymatic activation. These findings underscore the critical role of post-translational modifications in modulating protein function and exemplify the utility of AF3 in predicting PTM-induced structural changes relevant to cancer metabolism.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Two commonly used preclinical models, intermittent hypoxia (IH) and hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are widely employed to investigate the effects of WMI. The internal capsule (IC) and corpus callosum (CC) are major white matter tracts undergoing active myelination during the neonatal period, making them particularly vulnerable to hypoxic insults. This study aims to compare the effects of IH and HI models on myelination as well as the involvement of inflammatory cells in the IC and CC. We evaluated five oligodendrocyte (OL) subtypes, along with astrocytes, microglia, and activated microglia in IC and CC at postnatal day 12 (P12) and day 20 (P20) using spatial transcriptomics (CosMx, Novogene). For the HI model, C57BL/6 mice at P10 underwent permanent ligation of the left carotid artery followed by 45 minutes of hypoxia (8% O2 / 92% N2). For the IH model, P3 mice were exposed to 5% O2 / 95% N2, twice daily for five consecutive days. Animals were euthanized at P12 and P20, perfused transcardially, and brains were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in an ethanol series, embedded in paraffin, and coronally sectioned at 7 m. Slides were submitted for CosMx spatial transcriptomic analysis (NanoString Technologies), and data analysis was performed using the Seurat package in RStudio. Our results demonstrate that IH and HI models affect OL populations differently, and these effects vary by brain region. In the IC, the IH model caused earlier and more pronounced changes in OL differentiation-related gene expression compared to HI. In contrast, the CC was more affected by HI. Moreover, in the HI group, mature OL s in both regions showed reduced expression of myelination-associated genes. This was accompanied by greater activation of inflammatory cells and increased intercellular communication between these cells and mature OLs, potentially contributing to the observed hypomyelination. Overall, our study provides critical insights into how each model of neonatal hypoxia differentially impacts white matter development. This knowledge can help refine preclinical strategies and guide therapeutic research tailored to the underlying pathology of each model.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that early sensory immaturity plays a critical role in shaping bias-resistant, abstract visual representations that conventional models struggle to develop. Using neural network simulations and human psychophysics experiments, we demonstrate that gradual sensory development supports the emergence of robust and generalizable internal representations, reduces reliance on superficial cues, and promotes disentangled representations that enable compositional reconstruction and visual imagination. Comparative analyses of human and model behavior reveal shared patterns of bias resistance and adaptive generalization, including resilience to misleading information. Our findings suggest that gradual sensory maturation is not merely a developmental constraint, but rather a key mechanism that enables abstract representation learning.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Children born preterm have impaired brain development, and their perception of maternal speech is known to be affected by the atypical hospital auditory environment. Understanding how preterm infants perceive maternal singing is of critical importance, yet it remains largely unexplored. Using high-density EEG, we examined neural responses to the same melody presented through maternal singing, stranger singing, and instrument, and compared the responses in 12 preterm infants. Moreover, to examine their processing of spatialisation, auditory stimuli were presented under monaural and binaural conditions. Preterm newborns are able to discriminate the same melody when sung by their mother, a stranger, or played by an instrument. When presented monaurally, the mother's singing voice enhances widespread brain synchrony across the entire scalp. In contrast, this synchrony diminishes with binaural spatialization. These findings suggest that maternal singing constitutes a highly salient auditory stimulus for preterm newborns, eliciting a distinct neural signature. Given that brain synchrony is a critical component of healthy brain function and development, harnessing maternal singing may offer a promising, natural intervention to support neurodevelopment-particularly in vulnerable populations such as preterm infants.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

However, growing evidence suggests that this dichotomy oversimplifies the complex roles hippocampal neurons play in integrating spatial and non-spatial information. Through computational modeling and in-vivo electrophysiology in macaques, we show that neurons classified as spatially tuned primarily encode linear combinations of immediate behaviorally relevant factors, while those labeled as non-spatially tuned rely on nonlinear mechanisms to integrate temporally distant experiences. Furthermore, our findings reveal a temporal gradient in the primate CA3 region, where spatial selectivity diminishes as neurons encode increasingly distant past events. Finally, using artificial neural networks, we demonstrate that nonlinear recurrent connections are crucial for capturing the response dynamics of non-spatially tuned neurons, particularly those encoding memory-related information. These findings challenge the traditional dichotomy of spatial versus non-spatial representations and instead suggest a continuum of linear and nonlinear computations that underpin hippocampal function.

Although mRNA levels have historically been used as proxies for protein expression, growing evidence, especially from studies of the human cerebral cortex, has revealed widespread discordance between transcript and protein abundance. To directly address this limitation, we developed a rigorously optimized workflow that combines single-cell mass spectrometry with precise sample preparation to resolve, for the first time, quantitative proteomes of individual cells from the developing human brain. Our platform achieved deep proteomic coverage (~800 proteins per cell) even in immature prenatal human neurons (5-10um diameter, ~100pg of protein per cell), capturing major brain cell types and enabling proteome-wide characterization at single-cell resolution. This approach revealed extensive transcriptome-proteome discordance across cell types, with particularly strong discrepancies in genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, a finding validated through orthogonal experiments. Proteins exhibited markedly higher cell-type specificity than their mRNA counterparts, underscoring the importance of proteomic-level analysis for resolving cellular identity and function. By reconstructing developmental trajectories from radial glia to excitatory neurons at the proteomic level, we identified dynamic stage-specific protein co-expression modules and pinpointed the intermediate progenitor-to-neuron transition as a molecularly vulnerable phase linked to autism. Altogether, by enabling single cell proteomics, this study establishes a foundational resource and technological advance for developmental neuroscience. It demonstrates that single-cell proteomics can capture critical developmental events and disease mechanisms that are undetectable at the transcript level. As this technology continues to improve in sensitivity and scalability, single-cell proteomics will become an indispensable tool for uncovering the molecular logic of brain development and for illuminating pathophysiological processes underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

To overcome this problem, we fused diploid iPSCs to establish tetraploid iPSCs and differentiated them into cardiomyocytes (4N-iPS-CMs). We found that 4N-iPS-CMs had more similar gene expression profiles, mitochondrial amounts, contractile impedance, and resistance to a potassium blocker in post-mitotic cardiomyocytes than conventional iPS-CMs. In addition, we successfully generated 4N-iPS-CMs from two individuals to mix two different genetic backgrounds.

This metabolic strategy is tightly regulated by glucose signaling pathways, particularly the glucose repression pathway, which prevents the expression of genes required for the utilization of alternative carbon source. Central to this regulatory network is the yeast ortholog of the heterotrimeric 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which adjusts gene expression in response to glucose availability.\n\nThe activity of the yeast AMPK complex is primarily regulated by the phosphorylation state of its catalytic subunit Snf1, a process orchestrated by a balance between upstream kinases and phosphatases. Among the latter, the Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex Reg1/Glc7 plays a critical role in repressing Snf1 activity under glucose-rich conditions. Despite its importance, the precise mechanism by which glucose availability leads to Snf1 inhibition remains incompletely understood. Evidence suggests that hexokinase 2 (Hxk2) participates in this pathway, potentially coupling the early steps of glucose metabolism to Snf1 signaling. Notably, the toxic glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2DG)- which is phosphorylated by Hxk2 but not further metabolized-mimics glucose in its ability to repress Snf1, implicating glucose or 2DG phosphorylation as a key regulatory signal.\n\nIn this study, we explore the molecular basis of 2DG resistance in yeast through a large-scale genetic screen. The identified mutations confer resistance either by reducing 2DG phosphorylation (e.g., mutations in HXK2) or by enhancing constitutive Snf1 activity, via gain-of-function alleles in AMPK subunits or loss-of-function mutations in REG1 and GLC7. We describe a novel class of REG1 missense mutations, including reg1-W165G, that maintain normal basal Snf1 activity but fail to mediate 2DG-induced Snf1 inhibition, rendering cells effectively immune to 2DG toxicity. These findings position Reg1 as a central mediator in glucose sensing and further suggest that 2DG toxicity primarily results from aberrant Snf1 inactivation rather than a direct metabolic disturbance.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

Y.", "abstract": "Background: Fibrillins are essential components of the extracellular matrix. Marfan syndrome (MFS), the most common fibrillinopathy, is characterized by severe cardiovascular complications, including cardiac valve abnormalities, myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmias, and, most commonly, thoracic aortic disease. Unfortunately, no definitive medical cure is available. Objectives: To establish a zebrafish model of MFS, to enhance understanding of the cardiovascular consequences of fibrillin impairment and identify novel therapeutic targets. Methods: CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to systematically target all zebrafish fibrillin genes. The cardiovascular phenotype was investigated by fluorescent microscopy in embryonic stages, and cardiac ultrasound, histology, and synchrotron X-ray imaging in adults. RNA sequencing and drug testing were performed during early development. Results: Fibrillin-2b mutant (fbn2b-/-) zebrafish had a reproducible phenotype, with a subset of embryos showing endocardial detachment leading to early mortality. Interestingly, the remaining fbn2b-/- zebrafish developed dilation of the bulbus arteriosus, a structure analogous to the aortic root in humans, and survived normally to adulthood. Adult fbn2b-/- zebrafish displayed cardiac valve abnormalities. Transcriptomic analysis of fbn2b-/- embryos suggested the involvement of extracellular matrix remodeling and immune-related pathways. Administration of nebivolol and losartan did not improve the phenotype of fbn2b-/- larvae. Zebrafish lacking fibrillin-1 and/or fibrillin-2a did not show any reproducible phenotype. Conclusion: Our fbn2b-/- zebrafish model recapitulates key aspects of human cardiovascular manifestations of MFS, and can therefore be considered a novel relevant animal model for MFS. Studying this model allows us to broaden the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of the disease and discover much-needed disease-specific treatment options.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

H.; Rubinacci, S.; Zoellner, S.", "abstract": "The advent of efficient and accurate imputation for low coverage sequencing offers an unbiased alternative to SNP array imputation, increasing the accuracy of rare variant imputation across all populations. Since imputation accuracy generally increases with larger reference panel size and closer ancestry match between target and reference samples, leveraging imputation from multiple reference panels would facilitate better imputation accuracy; however, individual reference panel genotypes are often privacy protected. We present a novel meta-imputation method, MetaGLIMPSE, that combines estimates from multiple reference panels for low coverage sequencing imputation. We directly combine single panel imputation results using weights estimated for each individual and imputed marker. Across all our scenarios, MetaGLIMPSE outperforms the best single panel imputation for coverages 0.5x - 8x and across all minor allele frequencies, and for certain coverages and scenarios, performs equally to the combined panel imputation.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Humans spend time contemplating the minds of others. But this ability is not limited to external agents - we also turn the lens for reading minds inward, reflecting on our own thoughts, emotions, and sense of self. Some processes involved in reasoning about minds may rely on shared mechanisms, while others may be specific to the agent under consideration. We developed a paradigm where participants performed either a mental state inference task or a control task targeting either another person presented onscreen or their own mind. Using fMRI and multi-voxel pattern analysis, we replicate a well-established self-other axis along the medial wall of prefrontal cortex: ventral regions selectively decoded mental state inference patterns for self, but not other, whereas more dorsal regions decoded mental state inference for both self and other, compared to control conditions. Posterior cingulate cortex, on the other hand, differentiated the target of mental state inference. Using a cross-classification analysis, we also found patterns in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and right temporoparietal junction were sensitive to mental state reasoning in general, regardless of the target agent. These findings highlight one process reflecting reasoning specific to the agent and another reflecting the reasoning process itself.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Repetition-related gamma plasticity in macaque V1 and V2 is highly stimulus specific and robust to stimulus set size", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.20.660699", "authors": "Psarou, E.; Parto-Dezfouli, M.; Grothe, I.; Peter, A.; Roese, R.; Fries, P.", "abstract": "When a visual stimulus is repeated, the cortex has the opportunity to adjust its processing. Indeed, repeated stimuli induce reduced neuronal spike rates and increased neuronal gamma-band synchronization. Previous studies found the repetition-related gamma increase to occur both in human and non-human primates, for artificial and natural stimuli, to persist for minutes and to not transfer between strongly differing stimuli. Here, we further investigated the repetition-related effects using laminar recordings of multi-unit activity and local field potentials from awake macaque areas V1 and V2. We find that the effects on spike rate and gamma occur in all laminar compartments of V1 and V2. We quantify the degree of stimulus specificity with oriented gratings and find that the repetition-related gamma increase does not transfer to gratings differing by merely 10 degrees, the smallest difference tested. Furthermore, we find that the repetition-related effects are robust to stimulus set size, occurring both when one stimulus was repeated and when eighteen different interleaved stimuli were repeated. Finally, we show that alpha-beta activity increases and remains elevated when a stimulus is repeated, and decreases sharply when an unexpected stimulus is presented. These results suggest that repetition-related plasticity leads to changes in spike rates and rhythmic neuronal synchronization in different frequency bands that adjust the cortical processing of repeated stimuli.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}

M.; Uribe-Irusta, A.; Iriarte-Sarria, A.; Skupio, U.; Matute, C.; Tepavcevic, V.; Fernandez-Moncada, I.; Chapouly, C.; Marsicano, G.; Mato, S.", "abstract": "Reactive astrocytes shape central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and participate in myelin damage and repair mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS). Through the activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1R) expressed by neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells, endocannabinoid signaling restricts neurodegeneration and promote remyelination in preclinical MS models. However, despite accumulating evidence that supports a crucial role for these receptor populations in brain physiology and pathology, the implications of astrocyte CB1R signaling in MS initiation and progression remain uncertain. Using complementary in vivo disease models, here we investigated the effects of targeted genetic deletion of astrocytes CB1R on the expression of MS-like pathology in mice. Interestingly, astrocyte-specific deletion of CB1R reduced demyelinating neuropathology, attenuated astrocyte reactivity and improved clinical deficits during the time-course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice with astrocyte CB1R inactivation displayed unaltered oligodendrocyte populations both in EAE lesions and in lysolecithin-induced remyelinating spinal cord lesions, likely excluding that astrocyte CB1R modulate myelin repair processes. Conversely, inactivation of CB1R in astroglial cells restricted humoral and leukocyte parenchymal infiltration and reduced the expression of vascular effectors in EAE lesions. Finally, loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function induced by cortical microinjection of VEGF-A was less severe in GFAP-CB1R-KO mice. These results show that astrocyte CB1R signaling constitutes a significant pro-inflammatory mechanism in MS and bring to light a deleterious role for endocannabinoid-mediated modulation of astroglial cells with potential implications in the etiopathology and therapy of neuroinflammatory disorders.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": ""}
