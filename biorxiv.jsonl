Epigenomic profiling assays have identified millions of putative regulatory elements, but systematically determining the function of those regulatory elements remains a substantial challenge. Here we adapt CRISPR screening by epigenetic repression to screen all 111,619 putative non-coding regulatory elements defined by open chromatin sites in human K562 leukemia cells for their role in regulating essential cellular processes and proliferation. In an initial screen containing 1,084,704 gRNAs, we implemented an analysis framework to quantify perturbation effects, and nominate 1,108 regulatory elements that strongly impact cell fitness. We tested 8,845 of the primary screen elements in a secondary screen, evaluated their cell-type specificity in a second cancer cell line, and then used a single-cell RNA-seq CRISPR screen to discover 63 connections between distal regulatory elements and target genes. This comprehensive and quantitative genome-wide map of essential gene regulatory elements presents a framework for extensive characterization of noncoding regulatory elements that drive complex cell phenotypes and for prioritizing non-coding genetic variants that may contribute to common traits and disease risk.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

Deep learning models are emerging to predict gene expression or classify cell types using images as the sole input. Such models hold significant potential for clinical applications, but require improvements in interpretability and robustness. We developed STimage as a comprehensive suite of models for both regression (predicting gene expression) and classification (mapping tissue regions and cell types) tasks. STimage is the first to thoroughly address robustness (uncertainty) and interpretability. For robustness, STimage predicts gene expression based on parameter distributions rather than fixed data points, allowing for generalisation at a population scale. STimage estimates uncertainty from the data (aleatoric) and from the model (epistemic) for each of thousands of imaging tiles. STimage achieves interpretability by analysing model attribution at a single-cell level, and in the context of histopathological annotation. While existing models focus on predicting highly variable genes, STimage predicts functional genes and identifies highly predictable genes. Using diverse datasets from three cancers and one chronic disease, we assessed the model performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. STimage is robust to technical variations across platforms, data types, sample preservation methods, and disease types. Further, we implemented an ensemble approach, incorporating pre-trained foundation models, to improve performance and reliability, especially in cases with small training datasets. With single-cell resolution Xenium data, STimage could classify cell types for millions of individual cells. Applying STimage to proteomics data such as CODEX, we found that STimage can predict gene expression consistent with protein expression patterns. Finally, we showed that using STimage-predicted values based solely on imaging input, we could stratify patient survival groups. Overall, STimage advances spatial transcriptomics by improving the prediction of gene expression from traditional histopathological images, making it more accessible for tissue biology research and digital pathology applications.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

In this work, we report a critical IL-4/IL-13 dependency for the pathogenic IgE fate of type 2-polarized MBCs. Initiating a recall response in the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling diminished the type 2 MBC phenotype in mice and humans and, in mice, permitted the emergence of long-lived Ag-specific IgG2c+ MBCs. The divergence to a type 1-like response was dependent on IFN-g signaling and arose from both unswitched and class-switched Ag-specific B cells in vivo. This reprogrammed fate was sustained even beyond therapeutic intervention, revealing fundamental insight into the plasticity of the allergen-specific MBC response.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Artemisinin-based therapies have been central to malaria control, but partial resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, driven by mutations in the Kelch13 (K13) gene, threatens these gains. To investigate the molecular basis of this resistance, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to coisogenic parasite lines, K13 wild-type (K13-C580) and the artemisinin-resistant mutant (K13-580Y), following a 6 hour pulse of dihydroartemisinin (DHA). This approach enabled high-resolution profiling across all intraerythrocytic stages. Both lines exhibited stage-specific transcriptional responses, with the most pronounced changes in ring and trophozoite stages. These included downregulation of metabolic genes and upregulation of stress response pathways, including the unfolded protein response and protein trafficking. Transcriptional signatures consistent with a dormancy-like state were observed, particularly in the downregulation of SERA family genes. Notably, K13-580Y parasites showed a more consistent and robust transcriptional adaptation across stages, suggesting enhanced survival under drug-induced stress. Using MELD, a computational framework for quantifying transcriptional perturbation, we found that K13-580Y parasites exhibited higher DHA likelihood scores across the asexual cycle, indicating broad and sustained transcriptional shifts in response to treatment. Additionally, increased expression of surface proteins such as PfEMP1 and GARP was observed in K13-580Y parasites at baseline and following DHA exposure. Functional assays confirmed that anti-GARP antibodies retained efficacy against both lines, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target. These findings provide a comprehensive view of the cellular responses that may facilitate artemisinin resistance, identify molecular features of dormancy and pathogenesis, and highlight surface proteins like GARP and PfEMP1 as promising intervention targets.

To address this, 35 participants practiced an aiming task involving three distances over nine sessions across three weeks. They were divided into two groups: one trained with distances in a random order (HCI group) and the other in a blocked order (LCI group). Electrophysiological activity was recorded for all participants in the random condition before and after the training program using a high density EEG multiscale approach, including topographical, source estimation, and source connectivity analyses.

Rats, like humans, show individual differences in their tendency to engage in and maintain control over coping behaviours. While most rats exposed to a schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) procedure develop controlled, moderate, polydipsic coping, some vulnerable individuals engage in excessive, compulsive drinking, or hyperdipsia. The development of hyperdipsia depends in part on noradrenergic mechanisms, as it is prevented by the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, atomoxetine in highly impulsive vulnerable rats. However, whether noradrenergic mechanisms also underlie the expression of well-established hyperdipsia, or if other traits, such as the ICSD-relevant sign-tracking, confer vulnerability to its development, are unknown. Methods: In two longitudinal studies in male Sprague-Dawley rats, we investigated whether well-established hyperdipsia is influenced by atomoxetine and whether its development is predicted by sign-tracking. Results: Sign-tracking was associated with faster acquisition of SIP and the development of high or compulsive levels of SIP. Chronic atomoxetine both exacerbated hyperdipsia and increased the mRNA levels of the markers of cellular activity and plasticity c-fos and zif268, across the dorsal striatum, as revealed by qPCR assays. Atomoxetine also altered the transcriptomic landscape of the nucleus accumbens shell and the pattern of cFos and zif268 expression in the amygdalo-striatal system. Conclusions: These results provide new insight into the biobehavioural basis of compulsive behaviours, revealing a differential noradrenergic control of the development and expression of compulsive coping, the latter involving recruitment of distinct striatal processes.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

Plant ecotypes typically differ significantly in morphology, physiology, and development, yet our understanding of their underlying genetic basis remains limited. Despite their importance, studies of the molecular underpinnings of ecotypic divergence through developmental stages are rare. Here, we compared gene expression at different developmental time points between ecologically reproductively isolated coastal perennial and inland annual ecotypes of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus. We took two major approaches to understand differences in gene regulation between the ecotypes at the level of gene networks. First, we evaluated expression variation between the ecotypes in candidate molecular pathways. Next, we conducted gene co-expression network analyses to identify new candidate mechanisms driving ecotypic divergence. Overall, we found significant differences in global expression between the ecotypes and across developmental stages. Among the candidate pathways we evaluated, genes in the jasmonic acid pathway were the most significantly enriched for divergent gene expression. This includes the most differentially expressed gene in our analyses, which is a key gene (cytochrome P450 CYP94B1) involved in the degradation of bioactive jasmonic acid. Our gene co-expression network analysis revealed different but complementary insights into the differential regulation of genes between the ecotypes, especially at a more microscopic level of these organisms.

Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage benefit1-5.

Under nutrient deprivation the cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome9-11, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks11, serving as a survival mechanism12.

Currently, the combined effects of climate change and urbanisation remain underexplored, despite being among the greatest challenges faced by biodiversity. Here, we use a decade-long, individual-based study of urban and forest great tits (Parus major) to analyse urbanisation, climate and their interactive effects on yellow breast colouration, a carotenoid-based trait. We find that urban birds exhibit duller colourations than forest counterparts, being 10-20% less chromatic, with first-year birds and males being more negatively impacted in cities. Additionally, birds in the city are more sexually dichromatic than in the forest. Over the decade, colouration differences between habitats remain stable, following a similar quadratic temporal pattern. Finally, while climate has a weak effect on colouration, urban birds appear more sensitive to its influence than forest birds. Our results indicate urbanisation has a stronger impact than climate on great tit colouration, though both factors may interact. The heightened sensitivity of first-year birds and increased sexual dichromatism in cities may alter the strength of natural and sexual selection on this trait in urban environments.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a unique mechanism of binding HMPV employed by 4F11, which distinguishes it from previously characterized RSV and HMPV mAbs. 4F11 targets an epitope located at the apex of the prefusion F protein (site O) with a 1:1 stoichiometry, distinct from the 3:1 stoichiometry observed with other HMPV site O antibodies. Unlike other site O antibodies, which penetrate the glycan shield between Asn57 and Asn172, 4F11 binds vertically and directly interacts with the Asn172 glycan, representing a unique glycan-dependent mode of recognition. In vitro, 4F11 displayed high potency and broad neutralization across diverse HMPV strains. It also showed a low propensity for resistance development, with only a single escape mutation (K179E) identified, a mutation not found in any published HMPV sequence to date. Viruses rescued with the K179E escape mutation had significantly decreased fitness in vitro compared to wild-type virus.

Despite advances in proteomic workflows, CSP analysis from cryopreserved or low-input clinical samples remains limited by technical constraints, including reduced membrane integrity, inefficient labeling, and high background. To address these challenges, we optimized and benchmarked two complementary surface enrichment strategies compatible with low-input applications (fewer than 1 million cells) and real-world sample types, including fresh, viably cryopreserved, and dissociated solid tissues. We systematically compared oxidation-based N-glycoprotein capture and WGA-HRP-mediated proximity labeling across a range of input amounts using both solid tumor (A549) and hematologic cancer (KMS-12-BM) cell lines. The N-glycopeptide method yielded superior specificity in low-input contexts, while WGA-HRP captured complementary CSP subsets. Together, the methods identified more than 700 CSPs, with approximately 175 unique identifications per protocol. Both workflows detected dynamic EGFR internalization following EGF stimulation and maintained high reproducibility (Pearson correlation greater than 0.9) between fresh and cryopreserved preparations. To extend these findings to tissue-derived samples, we optimized dissociation protocols for healthy endometrium and applied the N-glycopeptide method to cryopreserved dissociated endometrium from three healthy donors. Enzymatic dissociation enabled accurate CSP profiling from fewer than 1 to 2 million cells. This study provides a systematic comparison of two leading surface proteomics approaches, validates their performance on cryopreserved and low-input specimens, and demonstrates applicability to clinically relevant tissues.

In vertebrates, neurotrophin ligands promote cell survival during periods of naturally occurring cell death, by signalling through p75 and Trk receptors. In the Drosophila optic lobe, a wave of apoptosis occurs during neural circuit development; however, whether this also involves neurotrophism remains unresolved. Drosophila neurotrophins (DNTs) are encoded by spatzle (spz) paralogue genes and bind Toll receptors instead. Here, we focused on DNT-3 (previously known as spz-3) and DNT-2 (also known as spz-5) to ask whether they underlie neurotrophism in visual system development. We show that DNT-3 (spz-3) and DNT-2 (spz-5) are both expressed in the retina and in medulla neurons, and multiple Tolls are expressed across lamina and medulla neurons. Over-expression of DNT-3 (spz-3) and DNT-2 (spz-5) could rescue natural occurring cell death, whereas their loss of function caused cell death, showing that DNT-3 and DNT-2 can, and are required to, promote cell survival during optic lobe development. Importantly, DNT-2 is expressed in Mi1 neurons and Toll-2 in connecting L1 neurons. We show that DNT-2 functions in concert with Toll-2, as Toll-2 RNAi knock-down prevented the rescue of apoptosis by DNT-2 over-expression and all Toll-2+ neurons were lost in DNT-2 mutants. Furthermore, alterations in DNT-2 or Toll-2 expression levels impaired connectivity of L1 neurons at the M1 medulla layer and altered dendritic morphology of L1 neurons. These data suggest that L1 neurons could take up DNT-2 secreted from medulla neurons during the establishment of connectivity patterns. As DNT-3 (spz-3) and DNT-2 (spz-5) are expressed in the medulla and they could influence both lamina and medulla neurons, this suggests that their function maintaining cell survival could enable the stabilisation or alignment of connected neurons across medulla columns.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

In the present study, we take advantage of the drosophila cell line Schneider 2 (S2) to further investigate miPEP8 function at the molecular level. Overexpressing miPEP8 in S2 cells induced a reduction of cell size as well as an increase of the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and an increase of the autophagic flux. A proteomics analysis revealed that miPEP8 overexpression in S2 cells induces the upregulation of several proteins including the autophagosome cargo protein ref(2)P (the orthologue of the human p62/Sequestosome 1 protein). The interactome of miPEP8 was generated and revealed interactions between this miPEP8 and the mTORC1/autophagy pathway. Bioinformatics analysis identified a short linear motif (SLiM) on miPEP8 sequence. Mutation of this SLiM prevented the interaction between ref(2)P/p62 and miPEP8. Mutation of the SLiM also reverted the smaller cell size phenotype observed when overexpressing miPEP8 in S2 cells. Finally, the cell size phenotype was reversed when cells were treated with RNA interference targeting ref(2)P/p62, suggesting that this protein plays a role in regulating the cell size in Drosophila.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Sensory circuits undergo experience-dependent plasticity during early-life critical periods, attuning the nervous system to levels of key environmental stimuli. During a critical period in the Drosophila olfactory system, we found that exposure to ethyl butyrate (EB) induces glial phagocytosis of odorant receptor Or42a-positive olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axon terminals which terminate in the VM7 glomerulus (Leier and Foden et al., 2025). Here, we extend these findings by establishing functional significance and circuit selectivity in this critical period paradigm. First, using a combination of two-photon Ca2+ imaging and the genetically-encoded voltage indicator ASAP5, we find that Or42a OSN odor-evoked responses are permanently suppressed in animals with critical period odor exposure. Thus, critical period odor exposure results in long-term changes to odor sensitivity in Or42a OSNs. Second, to establish the selectivity of glial pruning for Or42a axon terminals, we examined projection neurons (PNs) postsynaptic to Or42a OSNs as well as a second population of highly EB-responsive OSNs, called Or43b OSNs. We find that (1) within VM7, glial pruning is selective for Or42a terminals, and (2) while Or43b OSNs appear modestly pruned, they maintain their sensitivity to EB. To elucidate this difference, we turned to the Drosophila connectome. We identify striking differences in the scale of inhibitory connectivity to Or42a and Or43b OSNs, suggesting that Or42a OSNs may play a particularly central role in EB odor processing. This study expands our understanding of this critical period plasticity paradigm by demonstrating life-long suppression of pruned Or42a OSNs and establishing its specificity within and between sensory circuits.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

L.; Ackley, B. D.; Wolfe, M. S.", "abstract": "The membrane-embedded {gamma}-secretase complex is involved in the intramembrane cleavage of ~ 150 substrates. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)-derived substrate C99 generates 38-43-residue secreted amyloid {beta}-peptides (A{beta}), with the aggregation-prone 42-residue form (A{beta}42) particularly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, whether A{beta}42 is the primary driver of neurodegeneration in AD remains unclear. Dominant mutations in APP or presenilin--the catalytic component of {gamma}-secretase--cause early-onset familial AD (FAD) and reduce one or more steps in the multi-step processive proteolysis of C99 to A{beta} peptides, apparently through stabilization of {gamma}-secretase enzyme-substrate (E-S) complexes. To investigate mechanisms of neurodegeneration in FAD, we developed new C. elegans models co-expressing wild-type or FAD-mutant C99 substrate and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) variants in neurons, allowing intramembrane processing of C99 to A{beta} in vivo. We demonstrate that while FAD-mutation of either C99 or PSEN1 leads to age-dependent synaptic loss, proteolytically inactive PSEN1 did not. Designed mutations that allow stable E-S complex formation without A{beta}42 or A{beta} production likewise result in synaptic degeneration. Moreover, replacement of C99 with variants of a Notch1-based substrate revealed that disrupted processing of another {gamma}-secretase substrate can similarly lead to synaptic degeneration. These results support a model in which synaptic loss can be triggered by toxic, stalled {gamma}-secretase E-S complexes in the absence of A{beta} production and not by simple loss of proteolytic function. This new C. elegans system provides a powerful platform to study the role of dysfunctional {gamma}-secretase substrate processing in FAD pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

M.; Kar, U.; Kooiker, C. L.; Bolton, J. L.", "abstract": "Background: Early-life adversity (ELA) is a significant risk factor for emotional disorders like depression, likely by provoking changes in stress-related circuit development. We have previously shown that ELA increases the number of excitatory synapses onto corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) by decreasing microglial synapse engulfment. Here, we hypothesize that ELA induces microglial dysfunction via inhibition of the microglial phagocytic receptor, MerTK, thus resulting in the observed changes in synapses and stress-related behavior. Methods: To determine whether deleting MerTK in microglia phenocopies the effects of ELA, microglia-specific (m)MerTK-KO (CX3CR1-Cre+::MerTKfl/fl) mice were crossed with \"wild-type\" (CX3CR1-Cre-::MerTKfl/fl) mice and their litters were reared in either a control or ELA (induced by limited bedding and nesting paradigm) environment, from postnatal days (P)2-10. Excitatory synapses in the PVN were assessed at P10, and adult offspring were tested in a behavioral battery to measure threat-response (known to be dependent on PVN-CRH+neurons) and anxiety-like behavior, followed by acute restraint stress to measure the neuroendocrine stress response. Results: Following ELA at P10, excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses in the PVN were increased in males, which was mimicked by mMerTK-KO in control males, but caused no further increase in ELA males. However, females already had higher numbers of excitatory synapses at baseline, and showed no further increase with ELA or mMerTK-KO. Remarkably, the pattern of threat-response behavior in males closely matched the excitatory synapses, with mMerTK-KO control males escaping more from the simulated predator threat in the looming-shadow threat task, similar to ELA males. Again, females did not show any significant changes due to ELA or mMerTK-KO in the threat-response, although they did show ELA-induced changes in anxiety-like behavior. ELA provoked a greater corticosterone response to acute stress in males, but not females, although females were again higher at baseline. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that ELA provokes increased excitatory synapses in the PVN, leading to an increased active response to threat in the looming-shadow test in males only. Deleting MerTK specifically from microglia recapitulates both the synaptic and behavioral effects in control males, but does not have an effect in ELA males or control females, suggesting that the MerTK pathway is already inhibited by ELA in males and less active in females at baseline. Our work is the first to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the male-biased microglial dysfunction caused by ELA, with promise for the development of better preventative and therapeutic strategies for at-risk children.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

Here, to investigate how postsynaptic signals modulate the RNA granule, we employed a spatially-restricted biotinylation approach to quantify protein accessibility and proximity in the postsynaptic and RNA granule subproteomes. Upon chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP), we observed a sharp increase in the accessibility of ribosomes, translation factors and RNA binding proteins belonging to the RNA granule. Similarly, strong alterations were observed in proteins of the postsynaptic density, but mostly in those involved in signalling. Specific proximity to DBN1 and IGF2BP1 as postsynaptic and RNA granule reporters unveiled a shift of the translation machinery towards the postsynaptic compartment, whereas specific translation initiation factors and RNA helicases displayed marked changes in their proximity to DBN1 and/or IGF2BP1. Finally, alteration of synapse development and signalling by DBN1 downregulation caused a highly significant decrease in the proximity of RNA granule proteins to IGF2BP1 after synaptic stimulation, establishing a causal link between postsynaptic events and RNA granule dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

This heightened responsiveness is accompanied by a sustained increase in activity within nociceptive sensory neurons, suggesting that plasticity arises, at least in part, within the sensory compartment. We identified the neuromodulator octopamine as a critical regulator of the sensitization: signalling through the octopamine receptor OAMB is required to sustain elevated nociceptive gain, and feedback from one of octopaminergic neurons class, the ventral unpaired median (VUM) neurons, amplifies sensory neuron output.

Here, we develop Barcoded Rabies In Situ Connectomics (BRISC) for high-throughput connectivity mapping in the mouse brain. To ensure that the majority of post-synaptic \"starter\" neurons are uniquely labeled with distinct barcode sequences, we first generated libraries of rabies viruses with sufficient diversity to label >1000 neurons uniquely. To minimize the probability of barcode transmission between starter neurons, we developed a strategy to tightly control their density.

We then matched barcode sequences between starter and presynaptic neurons, mapping the inputs of 385 neurons and identifying 7,814 putative synaptic connections.

Non-invasive tools such as water-borne corticosterone (WB CORT) sampling offer a promising means to monitor stress responses in free-living amphibians. However, a central concern in conservation physiology is whether methods validated in laboratory settings provide ecologically relevant estimates when applied to wild individuals exposed to complex environments. Here, we tested the utility and ecological relevance of WB CORT sampling in larvae of the European common frog (Rana temporaria) by comparing wild-caught and lab-reared larvae. First, we examined whether environmental origin influenced baseline physiological traits by modeling changes in WB CORT and body mass across ontogeny. Wild larvae exhibited significantly higher baseline WB CORT levels and lower body mass than their lab-reared counterparts, suggesting increased allostatic load under field conditions and divergent growth trajectories. We evaluated the sensitivity of these traits to acute (48 h) exposure to nitrate, a widespread agricultural pollutant commonly found in amphibian breeding ponds. While CORT responses were not significantly altered, nitrate exposure led to a significant reduction in body mass in wild but not lab-reared larvae, indicating origin-specific sensitivity. Finally, we evaluated the validity of WB CORT as a proxy for tissue CORT. WB CORT and tissue CORT levels were positively correlated in both origin groups, with no significant difference in slope or strength of correlation, supporting the reliability of WB CORT as a non-invasive measure of physiological state in both wild and lab-reared larvae. Our findings demonstrate that WB CORT sampling captures biologically meaningful variation in amphibian stress physiology and is a valid tool for monitoring across environmental contexts.

While it is known that microbiome composition differs between tissues within an individual host, less is known about the ecological processes that underline these differences. To address this, we investigated whether the contribution of neutral ecological processes to microbiome assembly differs between external (skin and scale) and internal (gut) host tissues for a diverse panel of animal hosts. To do this, we fit a neutral ecological model to microbial communities from external and internal tissues across a variety of animal hosts. Strikingly, we discovered that the neutral model was equally or better fit to skin or scale microbial communities across all hosts, suggesting that neutral processes play a larger role in the assembly of skin or scale microbiomes compared to gut microbiomes. Furthermore, we observed that this trend is robust to different definitions of the metacommunity (i.e. the microbial taxa available to colonize a host).

C.; Schwarz, T.; Ku\u0308hne, N.; John, U.; Tollrian, R.", "abstract": "As a reaction to the presence of predators, many Daphnia species develop morphological defenses. These defenses are phenotypically plastic traits as their production is switched off in the absence of the predator. Previous studies identified some neurohumoral factors and candidate genes that are involved in the development of the defenses. However, there is still significant uncertainty regarding the involvement of certain genes and factors, and minimal information is available about the timing of gene expression changes throughout this development. In the current study, we thus performed a candidate-independent gene expression analysis of defense development over juvenile developmental stages in D. pulex. We analyzed transcriptome responses of the microcrustaceans to the natural mix of predator-emitted compounds and also to the pure kairomone which had been identified recently and which we synthesized. With the data obtained we show that the main factor correlating with the global gene expression patterns in Daphnia is molt cycle. Influence of kairomone treatment on the level of global gene expression is evident only in certain stages. The stages generally show unique patterns of kairomone-induced gene expression. However, expression profiles are highly similar for the naturally released and the chemically synthesized kairomone in each one of the stages. A number of genes with regulatory, structural and detoxification roles are differentially expressed as a reaction to the kairomone treatment. The most consistent response was found in the expression levels of ilp-3 coding for an insulin-like peptide. Gene knockdown experiments suggest that this hormone plays a role in the production of the defense. Many of the genes responding to the kairomone treatment have no predicted function stressing the need to investigate gene functions in Daphnia.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

The atypical hairpin structure at the telomere of linear replicons and the highly paralogous plasmids make the genome assembly challenging. We developed a genome assembly pipeline using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long read and Illumina short read to overcome these challenges. Using ONT reads enabled us to completely assemble the hairpin telomeres of the linear replicons along with a novel lp28 subtype plasmid and the complete circular plasmids of nine B. burgdorferi strains from five geographical regions in Canada. Although these strains are highly similar across the conserved genomic regions, variability was observed predominantly at the right telomeric ends. Comparative analyses revealed that all nine strains carry a ~2-10 kb right telomeric end identical to the linear plasmid lp28-1, which leads to variability in the telomere length and the gene content. Additionally, we observed diversity at the hairpin telomeric sequences of the linear chromosomes. Further analysis showed that the nine strains belong to seven ospC types and have diverse plasmid profile, highlighting the genomic diversity among the strains from the same geographical locations. Overall, these findings suggest that even the B. burgdorferi strains from close geographical locations can carry substantial genomic variation, especially at the telomeres and with respect to their plasmid content, emphasizing it to be a possible mechanism of rapid evolution within these Canadian strains.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

Reactivation of these fetal programs has compensatory effects during heart failure, depending on the type and stage of the underlying cardiomyopathy. Thousands of putative cardiac gene regulatory elements have been identified that may control these programs, but their functions are largely unknown. We profile genome-wide changes to gene expression and chromatin structure in cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells. We identify and characterize a gene regulatory element essential for the regulation of MYH6, which encodes human fetal myosin. Using chromatin conformation assays in combination with epigenome editing, we find that gene regulation is mediated by direct interaction between MYH6 and the enhancer. We also find that enhancer activation alters cardiomyocyte response to the hypertrophy-inducing peptide endothelin-1. Enhancer activation prevents polyploidization and changes in calcium dynamics following stress with endothelin-1. Collectively, these results identify regulatory mechanisms of cardiac gene expression programs that modulate cardiomyocyte maturation, cellular stress response, and could serve as potential therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

While it was shown that medin can promote A{beta} aggregation, it remains unclear whether this amyloid-amyloid interaction affects the structure of the resulting fibrils. Here, we investigate how medin modulates A{beta}40 fibril assembly in vitro using cryo-electron microscopy, aggregation kinetics, and immunogold electron microscopy. We show that medin accelerates A{beta}40 aggregation, co-assembles into hybrid fibrils, and modulates fibril morphology. Cryo-EM analysis reveals two fibril populations: one corresponding to a previously described in vitro A{beta}40 morphology, and a second, previously unobserved polymorph with A{beta}42-like features, including a structured N-terminus and a compact hydrophobic C-terminal core. The presence of a peripheral, unresolved cryo-EM density near the fibril surface suggests that the new polymorph is stabilised through heterotypic interactions, yet the atomic details remain unresolved, likely due to substantial structural heterogeneity. Rather than representing a limitation, this highlights how not all determinants critical for fibril assembly are necessarily ordered or resolvable in the final fibril structure, reflecting the inherent dynamic and heterogeneous nature of amyloid interactions. Our findings provide structural evidence that heterotypic co-aggregation can redirect A{beta}40 into distinct conformational states and suggest that dynamic or transient interactions contribute to fibril polymorphism beyond what can be fully captured in static structural models.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

Using ancient Yersinia pestis and Hepatitis B virus data, we show that mapping to divergent reference genomes significantly reduces the detectability and intensity of characteristic damage patterns, particularly at low read counts. Simulations further revealed that reference genome identity is the strongest predictor of damage intensity, while read count primarily influences damage stochasticity. We introduce a correction matrix that adjusts C-to-T damage profiles for reference divergence, improving damage signal recovery.

Predicting the cell-specific regulatory impact of 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) on mRNA expression and translation remains a key challenge for rational mRNA design. Existing studies such as UTR-LM, RNABERT, and RNA-FM train transformer-based models solely on 5' UTR sequences with fixed nucleotide tokenization schemes and auxiliary structural features. These models pay less attention to the integration of broader genomic context and thermodynamic objectives, which limits their ability to generalize across diverse cell types and accurately predict both mRNA expression level (EL) and translation efficiency (TE). In this paper, we propose RNALens, a foundation model pre-trained in two stages on multispecies genomic sequences and curated 5' UTR data using masked language modeling augmented with secondary structure prediction and minimum free energy regression. RNALens employs byte-pair encoding to capture variable-length nucleotide motifs. It is then fine-tuned on high-throughput reporter assay datasets from HEK293T, PC3, and muscle tissues to yield specialized predictors for EL and TE in each cellular context. Experiment results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RNALens achieves superior performance than existing machine learning methods for both expression and translation predictions across cell-specific and cross-context tests, offering an efficient in silico platform for guiding the design of mRNA therapeutics with precise cellular targeting.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

This necessitates the development of multimodal sensors capable of simultaneous measurements without interference between measurement modalities. Guided mode resonance (GMR) biosensors are highly sensitive to refractive index changes and well suited to out-of-plane optical coupling, but have not previously been implemented in a multimodal configuration. Here, we present the electrochemical guided mode resonance (EC-GMR) sensor, a SiN GMR photonic grating integrated with an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode that enables concurrent optical and electrochemical sensing. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations show that the resonance wavelength of the GMR shifts as a function of ITO thickness and applied bias. These findings are validated experimentally using EC-GMR devices fabricated with a range of ITO thicknesses. We demonstrate that the EC-GMR achieves a refractive index sensitivity of 84.4 nm/RIU while simultaneously measuring the double-layer capacitance. To highlight its multimodal capability, we characterise the optical and electrochemical responses of methylene blue, a widely used redox reporter in biosensing. By integrating photonic and electrochemical modalities in a compact format, the EC-GMR platform provides critical analytical information beyond that which could be obtained from a traditional single-modality sensor.

Actin filaments often appear as branches, nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex. Within the Arp2/3 complex, Arp2 and Arp3 are ATPases, which, similar to actin, may adopt slightly different conformations depending on their bound nucleotide. We investigate the impact of the nucleotide state of Arp2/3 complexes on branch stability, by mechanically pulling on them. Remarkably, we find that branches with mammalian ADP-Pi and ADP-Arp2/3 complexes detach with the same exponential increase as a function of force, but ADP-Pi-Arp2/3 complex branch junctions are 20 times more stable at all forces. We observe that inorganic phosphate (Pi) is in rapid equilibrium with ADP-Arp2/3 at the branch junction, and is released at a rate greater than 1 s-1. Upon branch dissociation, the surviving Arp2/3 complex, remaining attached to the mother filament, is a thousand times more stable in the ADP-Pi than in the ADP state. Surprisingly, branch regrowth from surviving ADP-Pi-Arp2/3 complex does not require reloading ATP, indicating that the Arp2/3 complex remained in an active state upon debranching. We reveal that GMF destabilizes ADP-Arp2/3 complex branch junctions by accelerating first the dissociation of the daughter filament, and then the dissociation of the surviving Arp2/3 complex from the mother filament. We also report that cortactin stabilizes branches in a force dependent manner, and enhances branch renucleation. GMF and cortactin do not bind to Arp2/3 in the ADP-Pi state.

We primed melon (Cucumis melo) seeds with two phylogenetically similar Bacillus strains (B. subtilis NCIB3610 and B. velezensis FZB42) and combined transcriptomic, metabolomic and physiological analyses across development. Despite comparable colonization, the strains provoked contrasting host programs and distinct dose responses. B. subtilis promoted radicle elongation, chloroplastic starch storage and drought tolerance irrespective of inoculum level, together with L-tryptophan and palatinose accumulation. By contrast, B. velezensis displayed a clear dose effect: low inoculum sustained normal radicle growth, whereas high inoculum transiently repressed it, coinciding with retrotransposon activation, suppression of AOS and proteasome genes, and enrichment of flavonoids and glutathione in leaves. Chemical assays showed that radicle inhibition requires the combination of surfactin, produced by both strains, with bacillomycin D, an iturin-type lipopeptide unique to FZB42; neither molecule alone reproduced the effect. This synergy links the strain-specific lipopeptide repertoire to the dose-dependent growth response. Although their early trajectories diverged, both primings converged on improved above-ground performance. 3610-primed plants restricted Botrytis cinerea via caffeic- and rosmarinic-acid accumulation, whereas FZB42-primed plants curtailed jasmonate-sensitive Tetranychus urticae mites through early JA-pathway activation.

Among several environmentally relevant antioxidants, we found that nanomolar concentrations of the trace metal selenium, in the form of H2SeO, completely prevented algal death in co-cultures with P. inhibens. Measurements over time showed that selenium significantly lowered ROS levels in algal cells, reducing oxidative stress.

Gain-of-function somatic mutations in the endothelial-specific tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2 have been identified as leading driver of VM pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether the aberrant venous lumen expansion is caused by recruitment of wild-type endothelial cells (EC) to the lesion or by TIE2-mutant EC clonal expansion. Methods: To investigate the contribution of TIE2-mutant EC and wild-type EC to the aberrant venous lumen expansion, we used a xenograft murine model of VM generated with a combination of TIE2-mutant EC and wild-type EC. To perform longitudinal studies, we employed a three-dimensional (3D) fibrin gel lumen formation assay and a migration assay, both using wild-type EC in competition or confrontation with TIE2-mutant EC. To investigate the mechanisms implicated in VM lumen expansion we used RNA-sequencing and short interference (sh)RNA in the TIE2-mutant EC. Results: We demonstrate here that in the VM xenograft model, the aberrant blood vessels were lined almost exclusively by TIE2-mutant EC, and wild-type EC were rarely found. Functionally, the TIE2-mutant EC exerted a competitive advantage over wild-type EC by inhibiting wild-type EC sprouting. In line with these findings, TIE2-mutant EC promoted repulsion of wild-type EC. ShRNA-mediated silencing of Sema3A or Sema3F in TIE2-mutant EC rescued this chemorepellent phenotype and restored the ability of wild-type EC to migrate, sprout and form lumens. Furthermore, knock-down of Sema3A or 3F in TIE2-mutant EC normalized the blood vessel size in vivo. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that wild-type EC are not recruited to the aberrant veins suggesting VM pathogenesis is fueled by clonal expansion of TIE2-mutant EC. Mechanistically, we show that Sema3A and 3F are overexpressed in TIE2-mutant EC and play a crucial role in the pathological vascular lumen expansion in VM.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

Bimax peptides impede nuclear import and reduce viability in yeast and human cells, highlighting the potential of NLS peptides as inhibitors of nuclear transport. In this study, we investigated the potential of the SV40-NLS to target Toxoplasma gondii importin  (TgImp).

Over-expression of TgImp rescued parasites from the SV40-NLS-induced cytotoxicity, confirming that the mechanism of action involves disruption of nuclear import. Importantly, the same construct did not affect cell viability in mammalian cells, suggesting a selective vulnerability in importin -mediated nuclear transport in the parasite.

In this study, we developed a F. excelsior pangenome reference using a new chromosomal-level phased linear reference genome, and de novo assemblies and long-read data from a geographically diverse set of fifty F. excelsior samples. We identified 362,965 structural variants (SVs), including 174Mb of sequence absent from the linear reference genome (22% of the linear reference size). We demonstrated that failing to explicitly link SVs with gene sequences can lead to substantial overestimation of dispensable genes (those that vary in their presence/absence between individuals) due to variability in the annotation process. Controlling for this, we identified 3,065 dispensable genes including 133 with gene ontologies associated with low disease susceptibility. We used the pangenome to analyse existing genomic data from over 1,200 individuals to identify loci associated with reduced susceptibility to ADB.

We observe pervasive usage of low-fidelity splice sites, likely due to stochasticity in recruitment or binding of the spliceosome. These sites are most likely degraded in the nucleus rather than targeted by translation-dependent degradation processes, suggesting widespread surveillance and rapid quality control of non-productive RNA transcripts. Our findings provide unprecedented insights into the propensity for error in RNA processing mechanisms and the regulation of alternative splice sites across a gene.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

J.; Tejero, J.", "abstract": "Cytoglobin and Neuroglobin are heme-containing proteins expressed in most vertebrates, including mammals, with still not completely defined physiological roles. Most of the putative functions of cytoglobin/neuroglobin, such as oxygen binding or nitric oxide dioxygenation, rely on the heme iron being in the ferrous (Fe2+) oxidation state. Therefore, it is very possible that reducing systems are active in the cell to maintain both proteins in the ferrous state. We have previously shown that the cytochrome b5 reductase isoform 3/ cytochrome b5 system, the canonical reductase of hemoglobin and myoglobin, can reduce cytoglobin at very fast rates, consistent with a possible physiological role. However this reducing system is unable to reduce neuroglobin, which to date lacks a validated, physiologically feasible reducing system. Here we have studied the interaction of cytochrome b5 reductase isoform 4 with cytoglobin and neuroglobin and found that cytochrome b5 reductase 4 can reduce cytoglobin at rates comparable to those observed with cytochrome b5 reductase 3/ cytochrome b5. Remarkably, it can also reduce neuroglobin efficiently. Studying different surface mutations of cytoglobin and neuroglobin we note that some cytoglobin mutations, in particular R84E and K116E decrease reduction rates by more than 10-fold, whereas surface mutations in neuroglobin that were shown to impair the interaction of neuroglobin with cytochrome c (E60K/D73K/E87K) show little effect on the reduction rates. We conclude that cytochrome b5 reductase 4 can supplement cytochrome b5 reductase 3/ cytochrome b5 roles for cytoglobin reduction in vivo and is a strong candidate for a physiological role as neuroglobin reductase.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

While microbial riboflavin precursors are well documented MR1 ligands, it is unclear whether host-generated riboflavin catabolites influence MR1-mediated immunity. Here, we report that riboflavin catabolites, including 10-formylmethylflavin (FMF), lumichrome, lumiflavin and alloxazine bind to MR1 with moderate affinity, while riboflavin itself binds weakly. In contrast to the microbial riboflavin antigens which increase MR1 cell surface expression, the riboflavin catabolites moderately reduced cell surface levels of MR1 by stabilizing and retaining MR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The riboflavin catabolites appeared to bind to the intracellular MR1 and inhibit MR1 exit from the ER. These riboflavin catabolites also weakly competed with Vit B based Ags for MR1 binding, thereby inhibiting MAIT cell activation. The crystal structures of MR1 complexed with riboflavin, FMF, lumichrome and lumiflavin, show binding of these three-ringed ligands in the A'-pocket of MR1. The crystal structure of MR1-lumichrome revealed that lumichrome formed a covalent flavin bond with MR1-Lys43 differing from the typical Schiff-base bond of MR1-Lys43-Ag complexes. Collectively, we identified three ring isoalloxazines that can bind MR1 and downregulate cell surface expression levels, suggesting a potential role in dampening MAIT cell immunity.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

We evaluated multiple annotation strategies, including sequence-based (Pharokka), and structure-based (FoldSeek, Phold) methods. Our results show that up to 43 % of truly unannotated proteins can be functionally annotated when combining structure-informed approaches with UniProt-derived annotations.

C4TUNE was trained on a biologically-relevant synthetic dataset comprising matched samples of parameters and response curves obtained using a C4 photosynthesis kinetic model. To speed up the training of C4TUNE, we devised a surrogate neural network to predict photosynthesis response curves directly from the model parameters and environmental inputs. Given response curves as input, we showed that over 99% of the parameter vectors predicted by C4TUNE could be used directly in simulation of the kinetic model and resulted in excellent fits. Finally, we applied C4TUNE to predict parameters for a population of 68 maize genotypes across two seasons. The predicted genotype-specific parameters allowed pinpointing factors that limit photosynthetic efficiency, validated using simulations. Therefore, the use of C4TUNE presents a fast and precise approach for parameter prediction based on minimal datasets.", "date": "2025-07-20", "journal": ""}

Computational psychiatry aims to reveal distortions in these processes through behavior modeling, providing a deeper understanding of psychiatric disorders. Previous studies, using Daws two-stage task, had linked the imbalance between habitual/model-free and goal-directed/model-based behaviors to disorders with compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts. The model-based component relies on the estimation of environmental probabilities. Therefore, we added a well-known deformation in subjective probability estimation to the model and this improved the model fitting. More importantly, the fitted deformation explains some variance of the anxious-depression dimension of psychiatric symptoms. The deformation parameter is aligned with the description-experience gap in decision-making literature. Our results point to subjective possibly distortion as the probable underlying cognitive process of anxiety, apathy, and depression.

Despite advances in molecular classification, reliable prognostic biomarkers for these tumors remain limited, particularly for recurrent disease. This study aims to identify gene expression signatures associated with survival outcomes in recurrent IDH wild-type gliomas, with the goal of improving patient stratification and potential therapeutic targeting. Methods: We analyzed gene expression data from 180 recurrent IDH wild-type glioma samples from the Glioma Longitudinal AnalySiS (GLASS) Consortium. Using multiple computational approaches including a novel network-based method (netSurvival) and various survival analysis techniques, we identified genes associated with patient survival outcomes. Results: Our comprehensive analysis identify several gene expression markers that are significantly associated with survival outcomes in recurrent IDH wild-type gliomas. The AFT log normal model revealed that FN1, HIF3A, and EIF4B are associated with poorer survival (hazard ratios of 1.40, 1.49, and 1.54, respectively; p < 0.05), while PTK2, CCND2, RAD51L3 RFFL, and MAX demonstrated protective effects (hazard ratios of 0.76, 0.78, 0.79, and 0.79, respectively; p < 0.05).

Analysis of contributing factors to the underlying heterogeneity in patient responsiveness is needed to comprehend these mixed results and to advance clinical translation. Methods: We provide the basis for a novel algorithm that correlates with responder (defined by stringent international consensus criteria) vs. non-responder classifications using i) the immunomodulatory baseline features of bone marrow-derived MSCs (MSC(M)) batches, and ii) differential KOA baseline clinical features, local and systemic biomarkers. We use our previous clinical trial with twelve batches of MSC(M) as a test dataset and demonstrate correlations with new longitudinal medium-and long-term clinical data. Results: We report that KOA clinical responsiveness to MSC treatment is dictated by a combination of the immunomodulatory fitness of the donor MSC(M) batches, clinical phenotype, baseline immune cell profile, and biomarker profile. Specifically, MSC(M) in KOA clinical responders have reduced expression of angiogenic genes, THBS1, CXCL8, and ANGPT1 and higher expression of growth factor CCN2 and distinct microRNA signatures, as well as higher in vitro ability to modulate monocytes that significantly distinguish them from MSC(M) from non-responders. Clinical responders had greater OA baseline severity, reduced physical activity; lower local baseline levels of CCL2, VEGFA, HGF; higher local baseline of resistin; and putatively lower frequencies of joint-specific intermediate monocytes/macrophages and activated CD4 T cells.
