Such an evolving world would likely have transferred heritable information during replication using RNA polymerase ribozymes. Though substantial effort has been put forth towards evolving RNA polymerases, many variants suffer from premature termination and low fidelity, resulting in low yields of full-length or active sequences. Replication of longer sequences requires a sufficiently high fidelity to lend an evolutionary advantage to an evolvable system. Here we demonstrate ribozyme-mediated repair of mismatched and damaged RNA sequences. Under conditions of saturating pyrophosphate concentrations, we show that a polymerase ribozyme can repair RNA sequences terminated in a mismatch, a non-extendable 2'-3' cyclic phosphate, or both, to generate a triphosphorylated nucleotide. This repair step increases the fidelity and allows polymerization along an extended template. This increase of copying fidelity advances the longstanding goal of developing a self-replicating polymerase ribozyme.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Y.; Borkotoky, S.; Bhawna,  ; Arora, S.; Suhag, K.; Basak, S.; Banerjee, M.", "abstract": "Viral manipulation of host cell morphology and behaviour represents an adaptive strategy that increases pathogen survival and replication efficiency. We establish a critical role for the downregulation of human Scribble, part of a cell polarity complex controlling morphology, apoptosis, and migration, for the potentiation of Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) infection. A structural protein component (TF) of CHIKV targets Scribble, resulting in its punctation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation, probably through the proteasome pathway. The interaction between TF and Scribble is mediated in vivo by the PDZ domains of Scribble and a PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM) of TF, as shown by a combination of co-localization, co-immunoprecipitation, and proteomics analysis. Disruption of the Scribble polarity protein by shRNA mediated knockdown of Scribble potentiates CHIKV propagation. A mutated version of CHIKV generated through reverse genetics, which produces all structural proteins except TF, cannot affect Scribble to the same extent; and consequently displays reduced infectivity. Our work thus establishes a novel function for the TF component of alphaviruses in the modulation of host response potentiating virus transmission.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Using simulated and empirical data, we show that signal fluctuations based purely on retinotopic stimulus position can produce identifiable frequency components in response to position-modulated stimuli. These components likely reflect structural rather than functional cortical factors influencing signal strength across different retinotopic areas.

We describe here a CRISPRi platform directed toward identifying hypomorphic mutations that preferentially changed resistance levels to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin in RND pump overproducers. An sgRNA library including single and double nucleotide mutations directed against essential genes of A. baumannii was constructed and introduced into multiple strain backgrounds, allowing strain-specific, titratable knockdown efficiencies to be analyzed. Other than NusG depletions, there were few candidates in the absence of drug treatment that showed lowered fitness specifically in strains overexpressing the RND efflux pumps AdeAB, AdeIJK, or AdeFGH. In the presence of ciprofloxacin, the hypomorphs causing hypersensitivity were predicted to result in outer membrane dysfunction, with the AdeFGH overproducer appearing particularly sensitive to disruptions. Increased ciprofloxacin susceptibility in two pump hyper-expressers was observed after depletions of a monovalent cation-proton antiporter protein and a nucleoid-associated protein, the latter of which was shown to promote pump hyper-activation. On the other hand, depletions of translation-associated proteins as well as components of the proton-pumping ATP synthase resulted in fitness benefits in the presence of the drug for at least two pump-overproducing strains. Therefore, pump overproduction exacerbated stress caused by defective outer membrane integrity, while the efficacy of drug resistance in efflux pump overproducers was enhanced by slowed translation or defects in the proton-pumping ATP synthase.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

We develop a suite of eight gut microbial functional pathway scores, each of which represents the activity of a set of interacting microbial functional features (based on KEGG orthology) relevant to known gut biochemical activities. We use a normative approach within a subpopulation (n = 9,350) to define \"Good\" and \"Not Optimal\" activities for these transcriptome-based gut pathway scores. We hypothesize that Not Optimal scores are associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its subtypes (i.e., IBS-Constipation, IBS-Diarrhea, IBS-Mixed Type). We show that Not Optimal functional pathway scores are associated with higher odds of IBS or its subtypes within an independent cohort (n = 71,220) using both the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire as well as self-reported phenotypes. Rather than waiting to diagnose IBS after symptoms appear, these functional pathway scores can help to provide early health insights into molecular pathways that may contribute to IBS.

This altruistic seed tissue supports the growth and development of the embryo by mediating the relationship of the mother plant as a nutrient source to the compatriot embryo as a nutrient sink. The endosperm is the primary site of gene imprinting in plants (where expression of an allele in offspring depends on which parent it was inherited from) and of parent-specific epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation, which are differentially patterned during male and female gamete development. Experimental results from a phylogenetically-wide array of monocot and eudicot plants suggest these parent-of-origin effects are a common feature across angiosperms. However, information about genetic imprinting and epigenetic modifications in seeds of angiosperm lineages whose origins predate the monocot-eudicot divergence (such as Nymphaeales, water lilies) is extremely limited. Additionally, Nymphaeales are an intriguing lineage in which to investigate seed genetic and epigenetic phenomena, as they are characterized by diploid endosperm and a maternal storage tissue (perisperm), both of which are unusual across angiosperm diversity. Here, we examined DNA methylation and genetic imprinting using two reproductively compatible water lily sister-species, Nymphaea thermarum and N. dimorpha. Our results suggest that maternally-expressed imprinted genes and differential DNA methylation of maternally and paternally inherited endosperm genomes are an ancestral condition for endosperm, while other seed characters like seed provisioning strategies, endosperm ploidy, and paternally-expressed imprinted genes might have evolved as coinciding, opposing strategies in the evolutionary dialogue over parental control of offspring development.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Glycylation, the addition of glycines, singly (monoglycylation) or in chains (polyglycylation), is primarily found on axonemal microtubules where it functions in cilia maintenance and motility. It is catalyzed by three enzymes in the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family, TTLL3, 8 and 10. We show that TTLL8 monoglycylates both alpha- and beta-tubulin, unlike TTLL3 which prefers beta-tubulin. Microscopy and mass spectrometry show that TTLL10 requires monoglycylation for high affinity microtubule binding and elongates polyglycine chains only from pre-existing glycine branches. Surprisingly, tubulin polyglycylation inhibits TTLL10 recruitment to microtubules proportional with the number of posttranslationally added glycines, suggesting an autonomous mechanism for polyglycine chain length control. In contrast, tubulin glutamylation, which developmentally precedes polyglycylation in cilia, increases TTLL10 recruitment to microtubules, suggesting a mechanism for sequential deposition of tubulin modifications on axonemes. Our work sheds light on how the tubulin code is written by establishing the substrate preference and regulation of TTLL glycylases and provides a minimal system for generating differentially glycylated microtubules for in vitro analyses of the tubulin code.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Pathogenic fungi occupy a wide range of environments across the world, and their ranges have been slowly expanding in recent decades due, in part, to climate change. Despite these links between increasing temperature and higher prevalence of fungal disease, the direct effects of rising environmental temperatures on the evolution of pathogenic fungi remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how increasing temperatures drive adaptive evolution in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. First, we performed serial passages of a C. neoformans environmental isolate with gradual changes in temperature over the course of 38 days. Through this approach we identified several distinct thermally adapted isolates with competitive growth advantages over the parental strain at high temperatures. We then characterized the phenotypic and genetic changes acquired in these evolved isolates, which include alteration of cell size, colony morphology, and, notably, antifungal resistance. Our genetic analyses further revealed distinct genes that facilitate thermoadaptation in different populations -- identifying new molecular players in the regulation of this trait and revealing that there are multiple independent routes to gaining thermotolerance. These results highlight the remarkable flexibility of fungi to adapt rapidly to new environments and raise pressing questions about the impacts of rising environmental temperatures on the future of infectious diseases and human health.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Recent research suggests that zebra finch embryos, despite being altricial, have functional hearing already in the egg to engage in parent-embryo acoustic communication and in anthropogenic noise detection. However, their auditory sensitivity during early development remains unknown. Here, we measure auditory brainstem responses over early postnatal development and show that zebra finch hatchlings are deaf even to loud, broadband sounds with hearing responses emerging between 4-8 days after hatching. Auditory sensitivity develops progressively and reaches adult levels by day 20, contradicting the notion of early parent-to-embryo communication in zebra finches. Additionally, egg vibrations induced by sound remain far below detection thresholds of vibrotactile senses. The striking timing coincidence between maturation of the peripheral auditory system and the onset of song learning suggests that hearing functionality may gate the onset of vocal learning in zebra finches.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

This suggests a rebound excitation mechanism underlying the ability of HVCx neurons to integrate over long periods of time throughout the song and represent sequence information. To explore this, we constructed a network model of realistic neurons showing how in-vivo HVC bursting properties link rebound excitation to network structure and behavior.

Formation and maturation of these junctions is important in development, e.g. for the generation of epithelial tissues, and loss of adherens junctions is linked to metastasis in cancer. It is well established that AJ formation is a mechano-sensitive process involving cis and trans clustering of E-cadherin and the mechanotransducive activation of -catenin that connects E-cadherin with the actin cytoskeleton. However, how mobility of E-cadherin in the cell membrane and their local density influences actin polymerisation is less well understood, due to limitations in controlling physical properties of cell membranes and performing high-resolution microscopy in model organisms or cell-monolayers. Here we place MCF7 cells labelled with fluorescent actin, E-cadherin and -catenin, on fluid supported lipid bilayers (SLB) containing the extracellular domain of E-cadherin, as a biomimetic system enabling super-resolution microscopy of AJs. We found that MCF7 cells were able to attach and spread on these substrates, recruiting E-cadherin and -catenin to form AJs that can mature and are mobile. Interestingly, we found that depending on E-cadherin mobility within the SLB, distinct types of actin architecture emerge. Low mobility substrates support formin-based linear actin polymerisation while high mobility substrates support Arp2/3-based branched actin network polymerisation. These polymerising actin structures are spatially confined to regions of low E-cadherin density suggesting they play a role in AJ repair. Following how these actin structures at the cell-SLB interface evolve over time indicates regions of both linear and branched actin being present at mature cell-cell contacts.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Analysis of multiple isogenic arterial segments from healthy donors revealed a significant stereotyped pattern of cell type-specific segmental heterogeneity in healthy arteries. Combining single cell with spatial transcriptomic revealed cellular heterogeneity not captured by commonly used cell-type marker genes. Determinants of arterial transcriptomic identity are predominantly encoded in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMC), and their differentially expressed genes are particularly enriched for different vascular disease-associated genetic risk-loci and risk-genes. Adventitial fibroblast-specific heterogeneity in gene expression coincides with a disproportionally large number of vascular disease genetic signals, suggesting a previously unrecognized role for this cell type in disease risk. Adult arterial cells from different segments cluster not by anatomical proximity but by embryonic origin. Global regulon analysis of disease related segment-specific gene expression program in fibroblast and SMC enriches for binding sites of transcription factors that are developmental master regulators whose expression persists into adulthood, suggesting an important functional role of the same developmental master regulators in adult gene expression and disease. Lastly, non-coding transcriptomes across arterial cells contain extensive variation in lncRNAs expressed in cell type- and segment-specific patterns, rivaling heterogeneity in protein coding transcriptomes.

Interaction niches are intimately related to the notion of trait matching, which posits that a species interacts preferentially with partners whose traits are complementary to their own. Multivariate methods are commonly used to quantify species environmental niches (or Grinnellian niches). More recently, some of these methods have also been used to study the interaction niche, but they consider only the niche optimum and require trait data. In this article, we use the correspondence analysis (CA) framework to study interaction networks and investigate trait matching without requiring trait data, using the notion of latent traits. We use reciprocal scaling, a method related to CA, to estimate niche optima and breadths, defined respectively as the mean and standard deviation of the latent traits of species' interacting partners. We present the method, test its performance using a simulation model we designed, and analyze a real frugivory network between birds and plants. The simulation study shows that the method is able to recover niche breadths and optima for data generated with parameters typical of ecological networks. The birds-plants network analysis shows strong relationships between species latent traits and niche breadths: a posteriori correlation with measured traits suggests that birds and plants of intermediate size tend to have the broadest niches. Additionally, birds preferentially foraging in the understory have broader niches than birds preferentially foraging in the canopy.

Despite their ecologic importance, cell-cell communication in fungi is underexplored, partly due to the lack of high-throughput techniques. Here we developed a Yeast Mating Platform (YeMaP) to investigate the interaction between fungal G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and pheromone peptides. We used YeMaP for high-throughput screening of 8,000 pheromone sequences and identified new peptides with improved agonism or antagonism action. We found that these peptides can be applied in a native fungal system such as the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum, to control hyphal chemotropism and reduce plant root penetration. Additionally, we utilized YeMaP in a one-pot assay to investigate how abiotic factors influence the communication of multiple pheromone-GPCR combinations and found that the cell-cell communication mediated by the GPCR Ste2 from F. oxysporum signalled robustly across different abiotic factors, while other fungal GPCR-pheromone interactions were more sensitive to changes. Taken together, YeMaP accelerates the identification of fungal GPCR-peptide interactions by enabling one-pot assays, and serves as model system for studying fungal cell-cell communication.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

In mice, signaling through estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) alters energy intake and multiple aspects of energy expenditure, effects that may be mediated by specific regions or neuronal sub-populations of the hypothalamus. This study investigates the function of ERa in neurons from the lineage that expresses Rprm (Reprimo), a gene we previously linked to thermoregulation in females. Here, we engineered a novel ReprimoCre mouse to selectively knock out ERa in Rprm lineage cells (Reprimo-specific estrogen receptor alpha KO; RERKO) and report changes in core temperature in female mice, with no changes in movement or food intake. RERKO females have elevated brown adipose tissue (BAT) temperature and lower tail temperature relative to controls, suggesting increased heat production and reduced heat dissipation, respectively. Developmental expression of Rprm was detected in the brain, but not in BAT or white adipose tissue suggesting temperature changes may be mediated by the nervous system. To confirm centrally mediated effects on temperature, we ablated Rprm expressing cells in the mediobasal hypothalamus and observed a reduction in core temperature relative to controls. Taken together, these results indicate that estrogen signaling in the Rprm lineage is critical for thermoregulation, mainly through the modulation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in female, but not male, mice.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

In the cortex, while peaking in the ACC, activity associated with time on task was extensive, also including activity decrements outside the default mode network, primarily involving motor and somatosensory regions. Information about reward levels was carried in the ventral striatum, consistent with its motivational role, but did not reflect trade-offs with increasing efforts during time on task. Instead, the ventral tegmental area and parts of the basal forebrain (BF) corresponding to the cholinergic Ch4 nuclei increased in activity with time on task and were sensitive to reward levels. This BF activity is consistent with a cholinergic role in driving compensatory efforts modulated by reward levels.

Studies found that replacing tyrosines (Y) with phenylalanines (F) in the motif of {beta}1 integrin displayed little developmental or behavioral defects. However, the tyrosine-to-alanine (A) caused embryonic lethality. Results: Here we report novel functions of the NPxY motifs in C. elegans pat-3 {beta} integrin. The membrane-proximal non-phosphorylation pat-3(Y792F) mutation caused hypersensitive egg laying in serotonin, which is more prominent than the membrane-distal NPxY804. The double non-phosphorylatable pat-3(YYFF) mutant exhibited serotonin hypersensitivity and defective egg retention. The phosphomimetic NPxY, pat-3(Y804E), mutant displayed a reduced egg laying in response to serotonin and fluoxetine, suggesting that the NPxY phosphorylation is associated with vulval contraction and serotonin sensitivity. Additionally, pat-3(Y792A), pat-3(Y792F), pat-3(Y804E), and pat-3(YYFF) mutants exhibited mechanosensation defects, demonstrating that NPxY phosphorylation regulates sensory neuron activity. Further revealed that exogenous serotonin reduced mechanosensation, while blocking serotonin secretion rescued the mechanosensation of pat-3 NPxY mutants, suggesting that integrin NPxY modulates serotonin levels in C. elegans.

Delayed continuous-report precision and 128 channel resting EEG were collected before and after the intervention. Absolute recall error fell in the Experiment group (p < .001) but rose in Controls (p = .005); the groups did not differ at baseline (p = .164) yet the Experiment group outperformed Control at post-test (p < .001).

Repeated founder events and strong genetic drift are expected to erode genetic variation at the range front, reducing adaptive potential and slowing or even halting the expansion. However, the severity of these consequences for the more common and highly mobile species undergoing environment-driven range shifts (c.f. invasions) is less clear. Here we combined historical observations and contemporary movement data of the common reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) with genomic evidence from across its European breeding range to (1) infer the origin and (2) quantify the genetic consequences of a recent and rapid northward range expansion. While there were no reductions in levels of nucleotide diversity or allelic richness, nor a signal of founder effect in the directionality index ({psi}), our combined dataset approach was able to infer an expansion origin from the southwest. Furthermore, we found that private allelic richness retained a slight but significant linear decline along the colonisation route. These results suggest that high dispersal capabilities can allow even philopatric species to avoid the loss of genetic diversity during rapid range expansions. Nevertheless, if multiple lines of evidence enable identification of an expansion pathway, we may still detect genetic signals of expansion.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Cell-APP uses two inputs--paired TL and nuclear fluorescence images--and operates in two main steps. First, it extracts each cell's location from the nuclear fluorescence channel and provides these locations to promptable deep learning models to generate cell masks. Then, it classifies each cell as mitotic or non-mitotic based on nuclear features. Together, these masks and classifications form the basis for cell segmentation training data. By training vision-transformer-based models on Cell-APP-generated datasets, we demonstrate how Cell-APP enables the creation of both cell line-specific and multi-cell line segmentation models.

G.; Sano, T.; Kanematsu, T.; oh, S. B.; Kang, Y.", "abstract": "Impairments of locus coeruleus (LC) are implicated in anxiety/depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increases in cytosolic noradrenaline (NA) concentration and MAO-A activity initiate the LC impairment through production of NA metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-glycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), by MAO-A. However, how NA accumulates in soma/dendritic cytosol of LC neurons has never been addressed despite the fact that NA is virtually absent in cytosol while NA is produced exclusively in cytoplasmic vesicles from dopamine by dopamine-{beta}-hydroxylase. Since re-uptake of autocrine-released NA following spike activity is the major source of NA accumulation, we investigated whether and how chronic stress can increase the spike activity accompanied by NA autocrine. Overexcitation of LC neurons is normally prevented by the autoinhibition mediated by activation of 2A-adrenergic receptor (AR)-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium-current (GIRK-I) with autocrine-released NA. Patch-clamp study revealed that NA-induced GIRK-I in LC neurons was decreased in chronic restraint stress (RS) mice while a similar decrease was gradually caused by repeated excitation. Chronic RS caused internalization of 2A-ARs expressed in cell membrane in LC neurons and decreased protein/mRNA levels of 2A-ARs/GIRKs in membrane fraction. Subsequently, chronic RS increased the protein levels of MAO-A, DOPEGAL-induced asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) and tau N368. These results suggest that chronic RS-induced overexcitation due to the internalization of 2A-ARs/GIRK is accompanied by [Ca2+]i increases, subsequently increasing Ca2+-dependent MAO-A activity and NA-autocrine. Thus, it is likely that internalization of 2A-AR increased cytosolic NA, as reflected in AEP increases, by facilitating re-uptake of autocrine-released NA. The suppression of 2A-AR internalization has a strong translational potential for AD.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Individual microbiota were generally stable, but beta diversity was higher during the follicular phase (p=0.007). Only 11 women exhibited compositional shifts, mostly occurring between follicular and ovulatory phases. Finally, using linear mixed models we assessed the association between taxa relative abundance and five sex-hormones along the menstrual cycle. Among these, 17-beta estradiol showed the largest number of significant associations, linking its increase to a decrease in relative abundance of taxa that are more common after menopause.

Rather, syntrophic methanogens increased in relative abundance and became central to microbial co-occurrence networks, particularly in association with hydrogen-producing bacteria. Network analysis also demonstrated that these syntrophic relationships were tightly coordinated in pretreated digestate but absent in the untreated CSTRs.

We found that elephant groups with calves comprised females -- mother and 'escort', who provided active care, and females who did not provide overt, active care -- 'other females'. Escorts, apart from coordinating their movement with the calf, provided allomaternal care by initiating positive and helpful interactions with the calf. Other females rarely initiated interactions, which were usually negative, towards calves. Primarily calves, rather than conspecific females, initiated and terminated proximity contacts and behavioural interactions. Calves were near and interacted similarly with their mothers and escorts, under feeding, resting, and social contexts, and almost never interacted with other females. Similarly, we found remarkable similarities between mothers and escorts in their behaviours towards calves, with the primary difference being that escorts did not provide milk. Our results suggest that calves begin to form differentiated social relationships from a young age. The presence of calves and their interactions with escorts might result from existing close social relationship between mothers and escorts or may establish new relationships. Allomaternal care may also reinforce relationship differentiation in such social species. As calf-escort interactions involved behaviours that may potentially be helpful in protection and feeding skill acquisition, the development and survival of calves may be affected by the presence of, and interactions, with allomothers.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

However, the role of individual arms of the UPR in the regulation of muscle mass remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the IRE1/XBP1 arm of the UPR stimulates the activation of ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, JAK-STAT3 signaling, and fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle of the KPC mouse model of pancreatic cancer cachexia. Furthermore, our results show that IRE1/XBP1 pathway is a key contributor to cachexia as targeted ablation of XBP1 transcription factor in mouse skeletal muscle inhibits KPC tumor-induced muscle wasting. Transcriptionally active XBP1 protein binds to the promoter region of multiple genes, such as Map1lc3b, Fbxo32, and Il6, whose products are involved in skeletal muscle wasting. Treatment of KPC tumor-bearing mice with 48C, a small molecule IRE1 inhibitor, reverses cachexia-induced molecular changes and improves skeletal muscle mass and strength.

However, precise association between the main coronary branches and the myocardial mass they perfuse is crucial to achieve a correct description of haemodynamics from the large arteries to the cardiac tissue. In this work, we use ex-vivo detailed morphometric data of human coronary microcirculation to build and validate a tool for a personalized coronary-myocardium association, and we use it in a multiscale computational model of cardiac perfusion. Methods: from the digitalized dataset of an entire human coronary microcirculation, vascular beds associated to single branches are extracted and analysed to infer patterns in epicardial branching. 3D segmentations of the coronaries with and without this information are used to generate two different myocardial subdivisions, which are compared to the one obtained from the microcirculation data. The impact on haemodynamics is assessed through computational simulations. Results: epicardial arteries exhibit characteristic patterns of transverse branching, with branching angles {approx} 90{degrees} and rate of branching, with respect to the distance along the vessel, depending on the core diameter. The addition of transverse outflows to the segmentations greatly increases accuracy in the myocardial subdivision, allowing discrimination between mass perfused by the proximal and distal arterial segments. Perfusion simulations including transverse outflows show more homogeneous blood flow across the myocardium, consistently with experimental findings.

Our hypothesis is that cardiotoxicity is exacerbated by underlying co-morbidities such as hypertension, and this causes cardiac dysfunction detectable on echocardiograms. The objective was to determine how trametinib/dabrafenib affect cardiac function in a mouse model of hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Male mice were treated with vehicle, trametinib or dabrafenib/trametinib without/with angiotensin II (AngII) to increase blood pressure. Echocardiography was used to assess changes in cardiac function and dimensions, applying statistical analysis combined with machine-learning to dissect the effects on different segments of the left ventricle (LV). The inhibitors alone had a limited effect on mouse hearts. Trametinib or trametinib/dabrafenib inhibited cardiac hypertrophy induced by AngII over 7 d, reducing LV wall thickness and mass. AngII did not significantly affect cardiac function, but the inhibitors caused significant functional deterioration. Segmental analysis revealed variation of contraction around the LV, with selective effects of AngII and trametinib or dabrafenib/trametinib in basal/mid-regional segments. Frame-by-frame analysis of radial (not longitudinal) displacement of the LV endocardial wall demonstrated variation between consecutive cardiac cycles that enabled a high degree of classification according to treatment. In conclusion, trametinib inhibits AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice but is detrimental to cardiac function, effects that are not moderated by dabrafenib. AngII and MEK/RAF inhibition have regional effects around the LV with greater effects on radial displacement in basal/mid-regional segments.

Although originally formulated in the context of operant choice, matching also applies to time allocation in foraging and to Pavlovian responses, indicating its generality across behavioral domains. However, empirical evidence has thus far been largely limited to vertebrates and arthropods. Addressing the broader applicability of this principle requires extending investigations beyond these taxonomic groups, across a wider phylogenetic spectrum. Here, we examined phototactic behavior in the acoel flatworm Praesagittifera naikaiensis, a species that acquires nutrients through photosynthesis by symbiotic algae and exhibits positive phototaxis. Using a custom-built T-maze in which the number of illuminated LEDs varied across arms, we found that the animals distributed themselves in proportion to relative brightness, consistent with matching behavior. Moreover, prior exposure to light for 24 hours attenuated this pattern. This manipulation was intended to induce a state of nutritional sufficiency, and the resulting decline in phototactic responses suggests that internal physiological states can modulate even seemingly reflexive locomotor behaviors.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Genetic defects in mitochondrial DNA cause rare mitochondrial diseases (MitoD) that offer a unique window into the energetic foundations of cognition, shedding light on the neural processes that are most energetically constrained. In this study, we assessed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on 29 participants with MitoD and 62 matched controls during resting state and tasks probing cognitive (N-back task), affective (cold pain), and sensory (multisensory visual and auditory perception) functions. MitoD individuals exhibited significant cognitive deficits across a range of functions, including executive function and working memory, mental and physical fatigability, low exercise tolerance, and low mood. These deficits were accompanied by markedly elevated blood levels of metabolic stress markers, including GDF15 and FGF21. Surprisingly, overall BOLD fMRI activity and connectivity were largely intact across all tasks in MitoD individuals. However, those with more severe cognitive impairment and higher GDF15 levels showed reduced working memory-related activity, which in turn mediated poorer task performance. Conversely, individuals with relatively preserved cognitive function exhibited hyperactivation in working memory regions and working memory performance compared to controls, suggesting compensatory engagement of cortical systems in high-functioning MitoD individuals. These effects were weaker in the sensory domain and absent during affective (cold pain) processing, suggesting an energy hierarchy in the brain that prioritizes essential functions such as affective responses while downregulating more energy-demanding, complex cognitive processes when resources are limited.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

The computational mechanisms underlying crossmodal backward processing, which we refer to as crossmodal postdiction, are not well understood. We examined crossmodal postdiction in the audiovisual (AV) rabbit illusion, in which postdiction occurs when flash-beep pairs are presented shortly before and shortly after a single flash or a single beep. We collected behavioral data from 32 participants and fitted four competing models: a Bayesian causal inference (BCI), a forced-fusion, a forced-segregation, and a non-postdictive BCI model. The BCI model fit the data well and outperformed all other models. Building on findings demonstrating causal inference during non-postdictive multisensory integration, our study shows that the BCI framework is also effective in explaining crossmodal postdiction. Observers accumulate causal evidence that influences their perception of preceding stimuli following a causal decision.

Yet, we lack systematic understanding of the microbial taxa that drive decomposition of chemically distinct carbon pools and of the metabolic pathways they employ across environmental gradients. Here, we address this critical gap using the first continental-scale soil dataset pairing shotgun metagenomes with high-resolution molecular characterization of SOM chemistry. We use data from 109 standardized soil cores across the United States to assemble 0.76 terabases (Tbs) of prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes (344 MAGs) and identify 66,727 distinct SOM molecules, integrating these datasets to reveal widespread microbial potential for depolymerizing recalcitrant carbon compounds previously considered stable. Notably, we uncover complementary metabolic specialization between two abundant bacterial orders, Rhizobiales and Chthoniobacterales. This metabolic partitioning is consistent across soil depths and activity levels, suggesting coordinated decomposition of chemically complex carbon through distinct but complementary biochemical strategies. The metabolic potential for depolymerization of recalcitrant compounds is supported by the abundance of these molecules across the soils, as indicated by Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS), and by flux balance analysis of metabolic models. Our continental-scale integration of microbial genotypes with their chemical substrates reveals that a substantial fraction of SOM previously considered recalcitrant harbors decomposition potential that current Earth system models fail to capture. These findings provide mechanistic insight for incorporating microbial metabolic pathways into carbon cycle predictions and highlight an underappreciated vulnerability of soil carbon to environmental variability.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

However, their specific contributions to motor and non-motor functions remain elusive. Using Calbindin 1 (Calb1) and Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1) as molecular markers, we investigated the functions of these nigrostriatal DAN subtypes in mice. Through intersectional genetics and chemogenetic manipulation, we selectively inhibited Calb1+ or Aldh1a1+ DANs by stereotactically delivering an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV-CreOn-FlpOn-hM4Di-P2A-mCherry) into the SNc of ThFlp; Calb1IRESCre or ThFlp; Aldh1a1CreERT2 double knock-in (KI) mice. This approach enabled subtype-specific neuronal inhibition via designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD). Following DREADD ligand administration, both Calb1+ and Aldh1a1+ DAN-inhibited mice exhibited significant reduction in voluntary movement and impaired motor skill learning, demonstrating their essential roles in motor function. However, only Calb1+ DAN inhibition affected early associative-learning behavior, suggesting a unique role in reinforcement learning. These findings establish Calb1+ and Aldh1a1+ nigrostriatal DANs as key regulators of movement and motor learning, with Calb1+ neurons additionally modulating reward-based associative learning.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms regulating gamete release in the ascidian Ciona robusta, part of the sister group of vertebrates. Ciona is a hermaphrodite, releasing sperm first from orange-pigmented organ (OPO) at the end of the spermiduct, followed by eggs from the oviduct beneath the spermiduct knob-like structure. In this study, behavioral and morphological analyses revealed that this sequential release occurs because the knob-like structure compresses the oviduct opening at the onset of gamete release. Observations of transgenic Ciona expressing Kaede under the gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 (Gnrh2) promoter showed that Gnrh2-expressing neurons and fibers accumulate in the epithelium around the spermiduct openings. In contrast, Gnrh1-expressing neurons are localized in the cerebral ganglion and project toward the ovary, suggesting distinct roles of GnRH1 and GnRH2 in reproductive regulation. RNA-seq and real-time PCR analyses revealed that Opsin2, Opsin3, beta-carotene-15,15'-monooxygenase (Bco), and several ion channel genes are specifically expressed in the OPO, along with Gnrh2. In situ hybridization showed that these genes are localized in the innermost OPO layer, suggesting that the OPO functions as a photoreceptive organ. Although, Gnrh2 expression has been considered low in adult Ciona, our study revealed strong OPO-specific expression with photoreceptive genes. Collectively, these findings suggest that GnRH2 plays a central role in gamete release regulation, potentially in coordination with the photoreceptive system, while GnRH1 may regulate ovarian functions. These results indicate that C. robusta employs distinct GnRH systems in a tissue-specific manner to regulate reproduction.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

In animal cells, they function in secretion, endocytosis and autophagy. Knowledge on their role in plants is restricted to heterologous localization and trafficking experiments as well as to genetic perturbation experiments in lily and poplar. Here, we analysed the five members of the Arabidopsis SCAMP family. Using SCAMP5, the most prominently expressed member of the family as hallmark, we identified three conserved tyrosine motifs that assist in anterograde transport from the Trans Golgi Network to the plasma membrane, while N-terminally located NPF motifs are crucial for endocytosis. SCAMPs dimerize both at the plasma membrane and endosomes, and dimerization is required for internalization. Functionally, SCAMP5 interacts with several plasma membrane associated aquaporins (PIPs), and is required for their intracellular trafficking as mCherry-PIP2;1 accumulated differentially and specifically in the root meristematic vacuoles independent of the endocytic or secretory trafficking capacity of SCAMP5. Triple and quintuple scamp mutants show only mild developmental delay under standard growth conditions, but are more tolerant to drought. In conclusion, our research links SCAMP proteins to PIPs and we propose that the drought tolerance phenotype of the scamp135 mutants is at least partially caused by altered PIP trafficking.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Our account of harm-mitigating, neurobehavioural responses furnishes a mechanistic understanding of maladaptive behaviour and impaired belief-updating, which are often underspecified in conceptual analyses. Grounded in neurobiological evidence, we specify PTSD-related impairment in terms of Bayesian belief-updating and establish an adaptive/maladaptive boundary using active inference and simulation studies.

These two indicators are combined into an E-A functional index, which we demonstrate as an effective screening strategy for identifying antibodies with strict antigen sensitivity and specificity. Using this E-A functional screening method, we successfully discovered antibodies or nanobodies targeting cell-surface tumor antigens and neoantigens presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA). These antibodies exhibited potent anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, converting these antibodies into chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and bispecific antibodies also induced T cell activation and tumor killing.

Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) enables direct observation of these dynamics in individual diffusing receptors, either freely diffusing in solution, using confocal microscopy, or immobilized on surfaces, using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) camera-based microscopy. However, these modalities are limited to distinct timescales - faster than milliseconds or slower than hundreds of milliseconds, respectively - due to constraints of observation time and camera frame rate, while the slow dynamics observed in immobilized receptors may be perturbed by tethering. To overcome these limitations, we employed smFRET in combination with Anti-Brownian Electrokinetic (ABEL) trapping to extend the observation window of untethered A2A adenosine receptors (A2AAR) embedded in lipid nanodiscs from milliseconds to seconds. This approach enabled us to characterize the conformational heterogeneity in both apo and ligand-bound A2AAR, effectively bridging the gap between fast dynamics measured in freely diffusing receptors and slow dynamics observed in immobilized receptors. Our results, taken together with previous studies, demonstrate that both inactive-like and active-like conformations are populated in apo and ligand-bound A2AAR and dynamically interconvert. Apo and antagonist-bound receptors are predominantly locked in inactive-like or active-like states, exhibiting only slow exchange dynamics on timescales longer than hundreds of milliseconds. In contrast, agonist-binding not only shifts the receptor population toward the active-like state but also accelerates the conformational exchange by nearly three orders of magnitude: from hundreds of milliseconds to sub-millisecond timescales. These results underscore the dual role of agonists in modulating both the equilibrium and dynamics of receptor conformations. Our study highlights the power of ABEL-FRET to probe structural dynamics of GPCRs, offering valuable insights into GPCR conformational landscapes and aiding the development of more effective GPCR- targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

MRI data allow optimizing positioning on the skull. The chamber is implanted into a precisely matched craniotomy, improving mechanical stability. For maximal biocompatibility, chamber and headpost are made out of titanium. It consists of an outer cylinder into which screws adjustably an inner one, called ''well'', with a glass window on its bottom. This allows easy opening and closing whenever access to the cortex is needed, while preserving a sterile seal when closed. Moreover, simply rotating the well allows fine adjustment of the window's distance with respect to the underlying cortex. Together with using a curved - rather than flat - glass window, this allows achieving gentle but continuous contact with the underlying cortex, which helps to delay tissue regrowth, notably of a neomembrane that must otherwise be surgically removed. The chamber's sealing system combines a silicone elastomer and O-ring, minimizing infection risk and CSF leakage. Data from longitudinal two-photon imaging using genetically encoded fluorescent calcium sensors reveal high optical quality over months, with excellent resolution of neurons and their activity. We also demonstrate the feasibility of two-photon imaging of genetically encoded voltage sensors in the marmoset cortex in-vivo.

While most papionins form discrete social groups (single-level societies), a few others form small social units nested within larger aggregations (multi-level societies). To understand the social processes that shape this variation, a more systematic, comparative analysis of social structure is needed. Here, we constructed a database of behavioral and demographic records spanning 135 group-years across 13 long-term papionin field studies to (i) quantify variation in grooming network structure, and (ii) identify the factors (e.g., the effects of sex, kinship, and social status) that underlie these differences. We detected considerable variation in grooming network structure across the papionins, even within the classic single-level societies. The papionins could be best divided into three broad categories: single-level cohesive, single-level cliquish, and multi-level. The cohesive single-level societies formed networks that were dense, moderately kin-biased, and weakly rank-structured, while the cliquish single-level societies formed networks that were relatively modular, highly kin-biased, and more strongly rank-structured. As expected, multi-level networks were highly modular and shaped by females ties to specific dominant males but varied in their kin biases. Taken together, these data suggest that: (i) discrete typologies obscure variation in social structure; and (ii) similarities in social structure are sometimes, but not always, shaped by similar social processes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDo all primate groups fit the same social mold? While factors like kinship and dominance shape the social lives of many of our close relatives, it remains unclear how their effects differ across species. Using a new database representing decades of field research, we found that baboons and their close relatives fell into one of three general patterns: one in which groups were cohesive and only somewhat nepotistic (i.e., kin- and rank-biased), another in which groups were more cliquish and nepotistic, and a final pattern in which groups were divided into clusters centered on dominant males. Distinct primate societies may thus reflect differences in the strength of females social biases towards kin and the degree of males social influence.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Although metabolic pathway databases are growing, many metabolic reactions, termed orphan enzymes, have not been annotated to gene sequences, which hinders functional annotation in genomic analysis. Moreover, protein databases contain many proteins of unknown function. Owing to this gap between known proteins and enzymatic reactions, various proteins of unknown function may be orphan enzymes; however, available tools cannot adequately predict these links.\n\nResultsIn this study, we developed DeepRES, an AI-based framework for comprehensive enzyme screening, to explore novel enzyme candidates from proteins of unknown function for reactions of interest. DeepRES implements enzyme screening via two steps: classification of enzymes and non-enzymes and prediction of catalytic capabilities for enzyme-reaction pairs. The two deep learning models comprising DeepRES showed comparable or superior performance to that of existing software. We performed screening of 1,255 orphan enzymes involved in the microbiome using DeepRES and successfully identified candidate proteins for 897 orphan enzymes.

Monitoring their community composition and population structure is essential for understanding ecological responses to environmental change. However, conventional approaches rely on manual processing and classification, which are time-consuming, prone to error, and unsuitable for high-throughput applications. Here, we present a deep learning framework based on the YOLOv12n-seg architecture for the automated identification, instance segmentation, and quantification of zooplankton from high-resolution images. Trained on mesocosm data containing multiple species zooplankton taxa, our model achieved a mean average precision (mAP@50) of 0.899 and demonstrated a 230-fold speed increase over manual annotation, even on standard non-GPU hardware. Unlike previous approaches that focus solely on classification, our model produces pixel-precise segmentation masks, enabling accurate estimation of individual size metrics. This expands the scope of automated zooplankton monitoring from presence/absence data to demographic assessments, including shifts in size distributions and the possibility to be used for unraveling morphological adaptations. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can overcome longstanding limitations in ecological monitoring by enabling scalable, reproducible, and high-resolution quantification of community composition. This approach opens the door to large-scale, long-term studies of freshwater ecosystems.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

To improve prognostic accuracy, we integrated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and clinical features from 802 breast cancer patients to develop BANDOL (Breast cancer Analysis with Neoplastic Data and Omics Learning), a Random Survival Forest model. BANDOL correctly predicted survival ranking in 75% of patient pairs and outperformed mutation-based models (time-dependent AUC: 0.9-1 vs. 0.4-0.9). Immune activation signatures correlated with a longer OS after therapy, while a shorter OS was linked to TREM2 myeloid cells, B cells, and leptin signaling. Model robustness was confirmed in two independent The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts (uterine, glioma cancers). Epigenetic features were the strongest OS predictors for BANDOL. Current therapies may be combined with strategies to target the methylations of ME3, PPARG, OLIG3 and SLC25A22 genes.

J.; Heung, L. J.", "abstract": "Cryptococcus gattii is an emerging fungal pathogen that is acquired through the respiratory tract and causes invasive infections in both immunocompromised and otherwise healthy people. Many of these apparently immunocompetent patients are subsequently found to have autoantibodies against the pleiotropic cytokine GM-CSF. In this study, we investigated the potential role of GM-CSF (or CSF2) in the host response to C. gattii using a murine model of infection. Interestingly, infected Csf2-/- mice were found to have significantly improved survival and decreased lung fungal burden compared to wild type (WT) mice. We determined that during C. gattii infection, GM-CSF promotes the differentiation of monocytes into alveolar and interstitial macrophages. When these macrophages are ablated in CCR2-DTR+ mice, there is a corresponding improvement in survival with decreased lung fungal burden, thus phenocopying Csf2-/- mice. WT bone marrow-derived macrophages challenged with C. gattii have poor antifungal activity, suggesting that monocyte-derived macrophages (moMacs) are rendered permissive for fungal proliferation. Therefore, GM-CSF and moMacs mediate immune responses that are harmful to the host. We further found that GM-CSF and moMacs preferentially promote the influx of eosinophils over neutrophils into the infected lung. This eosinophilia is associated with substantial inflammatory lung pathology. Ablation of neutrophils using Mrp8cretg iDTR+ mice significantly increased C. gattii burden in the lungs, indicating that GM-CSF and moMacs block the entry of these beneficial, fungal-clearing granulocytes during infection. Altogether, our results show that GM-CSF plays a key role in impeding host anti-fungal responses to C. gattii by coordinating monocyte-derived macrophages and granulocyte activity and crosstalk.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Recent evidence suggests that these diverse effects are mediated by distinct oxytocin receptor-expressing neuron. An outstanding question is whether these behavioral effects are also driven by distinct or overlapping populations of oxytocin-producing neurons. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is a major source of oxytocin and sends projections to the mesolimbic dopamine system and the extended amygdala. Previous work found that social defeat increased oxytocin neuron activity in the anterior PVN (aPVN) but not posterior PVN (pPVN). We reduced oxytocin synthesis with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in either anterior or posterior PVN in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), a strong model system for studying effects of social stress on brain function and behavior. Antisense morpholinos in aPVN had no effect on behavior in unstressed females but increased social approach and reduced social vigilance in females exposed to social defeat stress. In pPVN, antisense morpholinos reduced social approach in unstressed male and female California mice. We then used OxtCre mice to compare electrophysiological profiles of oxytocin in aPVN and pPVN with a population of oxytocin neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Oxytocin neurons in aPVN and BNST oxytocin neurons had higher post-synaptic potentials and responded more strongly to current injections versus oxytocin neurons in pPVN. These findings shed light onto functional and physiological heterogeneity of PVN oxytocin neurons. Our results suggest that context dependent effects of oxytocin are mediated by different populations of oxytocin neurons.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Although visual input is initially recorded in two dimensions on our retinas, we perceive and interact with the world in three dimensions. Achieving 3D perception requires the brain to integrate 2D spatial representations with multiple depth cues, such as binocular disparity. However, most studies typically examine 2D and depth information in isolation, leaving the integrated nature of 3D spatial encoding largely underexplored. In this study, we collected a large-scale, multimodal neuroimaging dataset consisting of multiple EEG and fMRI sessions while participants viewed stereoscopic 3D stimuli through red-green anaglyph glasses. Participants first completed a behavioral session including depth judgement tasks and a novel cube adjustment task to quantify and calibrate individual depth perception in units of binocular disparity. Then during two EEG and two fMRI sessions, participants passively viewed stimuli presented at 64 systematically sampled 3D locations, yielding over 66,000 trials in total across ten participants. Combining this large-scale EEG-fMRI dataset with computational methods via representational similarity analysis, we not only systematically characterized the spatiotemporal representation of multiple spatial features in 3D perception but also explored how different coordinate systems (e.g., Cartesian or Polar) might be employed across brain regions and time. Our results reveal that human brains employ multiple types of spatial feature representations and coordinate systems to encode spatial locations at different temporal stages and across distinct cortical regions. In addition to strong representations of 2D space throughout visual cortex, we find unique representations for depth and 3D features in later timepoints and visual areas, including some evidence for 3D processing in parahippocampus. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal organization of neural representations that support 3D perception.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, elevated levels of labile copper impair cell viability by inhibiting Sec61-mediated protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. We investigated how metabolic pathways, specifically mitochondrial respiration and autophagy, contribute to copper homeostasis and the translocation of secretory proteins. We show that copper selectively inhibits protein translocation in yeast cells grown in minimal medium but not in rich medium, highlighting a critical role of nutrients in modulating copper toxicity. Supplementation of specific amino acids suppresses the copper-induced defects in protein translocation and cell death, identifying amino acids suppressors of the copper toxicity. Using a panel of gene deletion mutants affecting mitochondrial functions, autophagy, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets, we demonstrate that metabolic pathways regulate sub-cellular distribution of copper and translocation of secretory proteins. Further, disruption of redox and pH homeostasis, and pharmacological inhibition of respiration, reveals that correct subcellular trafficking of copper is essential to prevent inhibitory effects on protein translocation process.

Common and rare variations in SYNPO2L have been implicated in risk for heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF); however, little is known about the function or pathophysiological mechanism upon disease risk. Methods: The role of SYNPO2L was explored with human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) models of a rare splicing mutation rs766868752 differentiated into both atrial and ventricular lineages. Electrophysiology was assessed via multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and contractility was assessed using engineered heart tissues (EHTs). Genetic survival analyses were performed to explore the potential therapeutic role of the SYNPO2L_A isoform in AF risk after myocardial infarction. Results: hiPSC-CMs carrying the splice mutation rs766868752 resulted in preferential expression of the SYNPO2L_B isoform and absence of SYNPO2L_A isoform, and atrial hiPSC-CMs displayed significant differences in action potential durations when unpaced, and spontaneous extra-systolic beats when paced. Contractility of atrial hiPSC-CMs carrying the splice mutation was severely compromised. Electrophysiological differences were normalized and contractility was partially restored by overexpression with AAV:SYNPO2L_A. Absence of SYNPO2L_A in the mutant led to an observed decreased phosphorylation of YAP along with significant downstream transcriptional effects. A direct interaction between SYNPO2L_A and LATS2, a known regulator of YAP phosphorylation was found to occur in hiPSC-CMs. Additionally, a common variant time-to-event analysis may suggest a beneficial effect of the SYNPO2L_A isoform to lower the risk of atrial fibrillation after myocardial infarction. Conclusions: A rare splice mutation conferring isoform predominance of SYNPO2L_B appears to disturb the electrophysiology and contractility of atrial hiPSC-CMs via LATS2 phospho-regulatory effects upon YAP signaling. Supplementation of the SYNPO2L_A isoform can restore many functional deficits and supports a specific gene regulatory role for SYNPO2L in modulating the risk of AF and heart failure.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Using an adapted proprioceptive drift paradigm from rubber hand illusion research, we investigated the embodiment of a robotic Soft Sixth Finger (SSF). Participants performed grasp-to-lift actions versus mere lift actions without object interaction, wearing the SSF on two different configurations: the palm and back of the hand. The Palm condition involved achievable actions without the SSF, while the Dorsal condition enabled otherwise anatomically impossible actions, extending beyond the physiological motor repertoire. Hand proprioceptive drift was measured before and after each task. Results showed that the SSF impacted body representation only when dorsally mounted. Proprioceptive drift was significantly higher for grasp-to-lift actions in Dorsal versus Palm conditions and higher for grasp-to-lift versus mere lift in the Dorsal condition only.

J. M.; Sadzot, C.; Michiels, T.", "abstract": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2), know as PKR, is a key antiviral kinase activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) typically produced during viral replication. Upon activation, PKR phosphorylates eIF2, leading to the inhibition of translation and viral replication. However, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract PKR activity. In Cardioviruses, the Leader protein (L), a short peptide cleaved from the N-terminus of the viral polyprotein, not only inhibits PKR but also blocks interferon production and disrupts nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (NCT). L disrupts NCT by recruiting host RSK kinases to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), where RSK phosphorylates FG-nucleoporins, thereby impairing NCT. L mutations that affect NCT disruption also impact its ability to inhibit PKR, suggesting a mechanistic link. Recombinant TMEV and EMCV viruses designed to disrupt NCT through different mechanisms exhibited some extent of PKR inhibition, supporting the link between NCT disruption and PKR inhibition. Immunostaining and live-cell imaging revealed that L-induced NCT disruption redistributes a fraction of PKR to the nucleoli, where PKR remains inactive. This suggests that nucleolar sequestration contributes to PKR inhibition. Additionally, L-mediated NCT disruption leads to the release of nuclear RNA-binding proteins (nRBPs) into the cytosol, which may bind or modify viral dsRNA, further preventing PKR activation. Collectively, these results highlight nucleocytoplasmic trafficking as a critical regulatory mechanism governing PKR activation. Thus, beyond the specific action of cardiovirus L protein, our study reveals that interference with host nucleocytoplasmic transport can significantly impact the subcellular localization and functional regulation of immune effectors such as PKR.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Complete genome sequencing revealed a conserved, plasmid-encoded biosynthetic gene cluster for the thiopeptide bacteriocin micrococcin P1 (MP1). All genes necessary for MP1 biosynthesis, modification, export, and immunity were identified, and compound production was confirmed by HPLC and LC-MS. Comparative analysis with publicly available S. chromogenes genomes revealed that the MP1 cluster appears unique to these isolates. Both strains showed full phenotypic susceptibility to tested antibiotics, despite 4S90 carrying the lnuA gene, which did not confer detectable resistance under standard conditions. Classical staphylococcal toxin genes were also absent. Virulence gene profiling revealed a conserved repertoire of colonization- and persistence-associated genes, including factors involved in adhesion, capsule formation, and iron acquisition, but no markers of aggressive pathogenicity. Mobile genetic elements, including prophages and genomic islands, were common but did not carry antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes, suggesting a low risk of transmission of new pathogenic traits to the endogenous microbiome, including opportunistic bacteria. These findings suggest that MP1-producing S. chromogenes strains combine antimicrobial functionality with low virulence potential, highlighting their potential ecological role as protective commensals on the teat skin and in the broader mammary ecosystem of dairy ruminants.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

An example is Bacillus subtilis, which can switch motility, biofilm or antagonistic interaction patterns either as a result of spontaneous mutations or due to changes in prophage elements. Prophages can integrate into conserved and functional loci, disrupting host genes and modulating their phenotypic traits. In B. subtilis, the SP{beta} prophage integrates into the sporulation-associated gene spsM, whose reversible inactivation during lysogeny has also been implicated in modulating biofilm formation and host development. Here, we investigated the evolutionary and phenotypic consequences of spsM disruption through both SP{beta} integration and artificial mutagenesis (spsM::kan) in B. subtilis natural isolates. We observed that spsM::kan mutants frequently developed spontaneous mutations, particularly in swrA and comP, key regulators of swarming motility and biofilm development. These mutations reproducibly gave rise to altered colony morphotypes and impaired surface motility, suggesting strong selection for loss-of-function mutations in regulatory genes under laboratory conditions. In contrast, SP{beta} lysogens exhibited minimal mutational diversification, indicating that dynamic prophage excision may preserve genomic stability. In this work spsM inactivation alone did not significantly impair biofilm formation or motility. However, we reveal a novel role of prophage integration sites as possible evolutionary hotspots that influence genome integrity and adaptive potential. This work highlights the interplay between prophage integration, host genome architecture, and the selective pressures shaping bacterial multicellular communities.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Yet, our understanding of how heatwaves and cold snaps influence disease dynamics remains underexplored. Using the host Daphnia magna infected with its microsporidian microparasite Ordospora colligata, pathogen fitness and host population size were measured in experimental populations using a factorial design at four baseline temperatures (14, 17, 20 and 23{degrees}C). A heatwave or cold snap treatment with an amplitude of {+/-}6{o}C was administered four weeks after measurements began and lasted for ten days. The effect of heatwaves is dependent on baseline temperature but can induce long-lasting increases in burden (>4 weeks). The impact of cold snaps were also temperature-dependent, leading to short-term increases in parasite fitness at higher temperatures. Host population size also varied in response to temperature and treatment. Importantly, burden and host density were interdependent, jointly shaping infection patterns. At lower temperatures, parasite burden and host population size were positively correlated, whereas at higher temperatures, increased host population size corresponded with reduced burden. These patterns were consistent at both individual and population levels, underscoring how individual physiological responses can scale up to impact disease dynamics across populations. Thus, extreme temperature variation can have complex, context-specific outcomes on disease dynamics. As climate extremes become more frequent, understanding these nuanced responses is critical for predicting and managing disease risk in natural populations.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Compared to traditional static end-point assays, live-cell longitudinal imaging captures the temporal trajectories of individual cells, including transient morphological adaptations, motility shifts, and divergent subpopulation behaviors, enabling high content features and more robust early prediction of treatment outcomes. Fluorescence-based screening, while highly specific, is constrained in live-cell contexts by broad spectral overlaps (limiting multiplexing to fewer than six channels), bulky fluorophores that may perturb small-molecule interactions, and photobleaching or phototoxicity under repeated excitation. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy overcomes these barriers by delivering label-free, quantitative chemical contrasts alongside morphological information. Here, we present a low-cost, 3D printed cell culture platform compatible with the stringent optical requirements of SRS microscopy. This set up enables real-time drug delivery and continuous monitoring of biochemical and morphological changes in living cells during 24-hour time-lapse imaging with minimal photodamage. We outline a processing pipeline for longitudinal SRS images to extract chemical and morphological features of single live cells. Using this system, we showcase time-lapse SRS microscopy as a tool to map heterogenous drug-induced single-cell response over time, enabling the identification of varying trajectories within complex cell populations.

Embedded within the contractile sarcomere and flanked by extensible regulatory tails, TK is thought to sense mechanical signals arising from muscle function. Studies on TK to date have focused narrowly on the human representative. To investigate if a pseudokinase character is a hallmark of TK, we have studied sequences of distantly evolved fish representatives and rationalized conservation patterns by resolving the crystal structure of TK from medaka isoform b. We find that sequence alterations in catalytic motifs involved in ATP and magnesium binding, respectively {theta}xK ({theta}: bulky hydrophobic residue) and EFG, are evolutionarily conserved in TK. Beyond the kinase domain, N- and C-terminal flanking tails show remarkable structural similarity across human and medaka orthologues, even though sequence conservation is limited to individual residues and short motifs: a YD-motif in the N-terminal tail; a [R/K]H[R/K]RYY sequence, a R-7x-R motif and position -2 of the latter in the C-terminal tail. We observe that motifs in the C-terminal tail consistently covary with the divergent functional motifs of TK, being part of its pseudokinase signature. In contrast, the proposed inhibition of the catalytic aspartate by a tyrosine residue from the P+1 loop is not significantly conserved outside mammals. Finally, based on these features and sequence clustering analysis, we propose a classification of titin gene duplicates from fish into a and b isoforms (ttna and ttnb) that can assist future comparative studies.

Using coherence and manifold analyses along with deep learning, we identified strong nonlinear interactions in mixed music that impacted the fidelity and geometry of the neural code. We found that increasing musical complexity resulted in the creation of new neural modes, but this increased dimensionality was associated with decreased reliability. This tradeoff persisted even after hearing loss, the effects of which were largely corrected with suitable amplification.

Through chemical inhibition and genetics, we determined that the class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) RPD3 is required for normal Histoplasma yeast morphology at 37 {o}C. Rpd3 regulated the expression of key morphology-specific genes, including critical virulence factors and transcription factors (TFs), was required for normal DNA-binding activity of yeast-promoting TFs, and influenced histone acetylation levels at the loci of putative pro-filamentation TFs. Furthermore, Rpd3 was required for virulence in a macrophage model of infection.

Here, we investigate how cells initiate and execute endomitosis in the C. elegans intestine and find that endomitotic cells fail to assemble a central spindle or initiate cytokinetic furrowing. We find that endomitotic cells transcriptionally repress multiple cytokinesis regulators, especially the central spindle factors ZEN-4Mklp1, CYK-4RacGap1 and SPD-1Prc1. Intestinal cells lose the capacity to perform cytokinesis in late embryogenesis, and we find that the conserved DREAM (DP, RB-related, E2F and MuvB) complex is involved in the repression of central spindle genes.

My re-analysis translating this effect to percentage change finds no robust statistical support for consistent decline, with overall changes near zero: from -1% to +1% diversity change depending on the averaging method. When testing each species individually, roughly half increased and half decreased in diversity. While genetic diversity is expected to decline following population losses, evolutionary theory predicts such declines substantially lag behind population reductions, and thus should not be measurable on average at the timescales in Shaw's data, except in dramatically collapsing species.

A bulk segregant analysis of F3 hybrids revealed a strong genomic signal on chromosome VI, overlapping the hoxdb cluster, echoing previous findings in another spine-reduced stickleback population. Developmental series of the Scottish freshwater and marine populations using skeletal stainings and transcriptomic analyses of dorsal tissue showed delayed and incomplete cartilage formation and altered gene expression during critical stages of dorsal skeletal development in spineless fish, notably of several hoxdb genes.

All animals learned the task and showed high accuracy for short (3 tone) patterns. Performance remained above chance for longer patterns (5 or 7 tones), though accuracy declined with increased pattern length. In a control condition where both random and regular segments contained the same five frequencies, ferrets continued to detect regularity, indicating they relied on temporal patterning rather than spectral content. To further rule out spectral cues, we included transitions from random 20 tone sequences to random 3, 5 or 7 tone sequences without repetition. Although these stimuli elicited performance above the false alarm rate seen in fully random trials, detection accuracy remained substantially lower than that observed for regular sequences. This suggests ferrets were not solely detecting changes in spectral statistics, but true regularity.

Dissociation of NTF reveals a peptide tethered agonist (TA) which is responsible for the activation of the ADGRs. The NTF-bound ADGRs contain the encrypted TA that assumes a {beta}-strand configuration within the GAIN domain, which is markedly different from a U-shaped -helical configuration of TA in the active cryo-EM structures of ADGRs. However, how the TA dramatically changes its configuration and binds to the ADGR CTF remains unknown. In this study, we have performed all-atom enhanced sampling simulations using a novel Peptide-Gaussian accelerated Molecular Dynamics (Pep-GaMD) method on TA binding to the ADGRD1. The Pep-GaMD simulations captured spontaneous binding of the TA into orthosteric pocket of the ADGRD1 and its large conformational transition from the extended {beta} strand to the U-shaped  helical configuration. We were able to identify important low-energy conformations of the TA in the binding pathway, as well as different active and inactive states of ADGRD1, in the presence and absence of the Gs protein.

Detailed surveys of plant parasitic nematodes in Nepal have not been conducted. Therefore, there is no information on which RKN species occur in key tomato-growing areas. We conducted an initial survey to assess the occurrence and importance of RKN. Nine different districts of Nepal were included: Bhaktapur, Chitwan, Dhading, Dolakha, Kaski, Kathmandu, Kavrepalanchok, Lalitpur, and Lamjung. In the first approach, 70 farmers were interviewed about their awareness and knowledge of RKN. More than 60% of the farmers surveyed knew of RKN and the main signs and symptoms. 40% had limited or no knowledge about it. In a second approach, we conducted a survey of RKN occurrence in tomato fields in the same nine districts. Soil sampling and subsequent analysis in the Kathmandu district revealed RKN infestation at very high levels. Except for Kaski and Chitwan, RKN prevalence was found to be 100% in the districts sampled. The overall prevalence of Meloidogyne species was also 100% in most districts. To identify the species, samples with RKN-infected galls were collected and determined morphologically using perineal patterns and molecularly using specific PCR analyses.

D.; Bak, S.", "abstract": "Plant-insect coevolution drives the diversification of specialized metabolites, yet the genetic basis of ecotypic variation in defensive chemistry remains poorly understood. The wild crucifer Barbarea vulgaris comprises two ecotypes-an insect-resistant G-type and a susceptible P-type-characterized by distinct triterpenoid saponin profiles. To investigate the causal role of saponin composition in insect resistance, we developed a stable transformation system for B. vulgaris. We expressed the G-type {beta}-amyrin synthase gene (LUP5) in both ecotypes and silenced the cytochrome P450 gene CYP72A552 in the G-type. We combined metabolic profiling with insect feeding assays to assess functional outcomes. Ectopic expression of G-type LUP5 in the susceptible P-type conferred up to 95% reduction in Plutella xylostella feeding, accompanied by increased accumulation of three hederagenin-derived monodesmosidic saponins. In contrast, silencing of CYP72A552 reduced hederagenin derived saponin levels but did not affect herbivory, suggesting threshold-dependent resistance. We provide direct in planta evidence that LUP5 is a key determinant of ecotypic insect resistance in B. vulgaris. Our findings establish a functional link between oxidosqualene cyclase activity, saponin structural diversification, and ecological defense, highlighting the roles of both sapogenin backbone and glycosylation pattern in saponin-mediated herbivore deterrence.

While paired associative stimulation (PAS) can induce M1 plasticity, people with PD (PwPD) demonstrate variability that cannot be accounted for by disease progression or medication status. Distinct M1 interneuron populations and attention-related brain structures may influence the reduced PAS-induced neuroplasticity. We aimed to characterize M1 interneuron plasticity in PwPD using attention-modulated PAS and identify neurostructural correlates. PwPD underwent MRI, then a PAS protocol with task-relevant attention. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) assessments of corticospinal excitability using posterior-to-anterior (PA) and anterior-to-posterior (AP) current directions were employed before and three post-PAS time-points. PAS induced distinct time-dependent M1 interneuron excitability changes. PA TMS showed increased corticospinal excitability at all post-PAS time-points; AP TMS increased only at 30 minutes. Rostral middle frontal gyrus volume uniquely explained variance in PA-sensitive M1 interneuron plasticity. In contrast, AP-sensitive plasticity was associated with baseline AP TMS excitability and age. These findings highlight that M1 interneuron circuits show unique neuroplasticity patterns in PwPD and relate to prefrontal brain volume.

This study aimed to fill this gap by examining how people coordinate in a strategic game when observing partial kinematic information from their partner's actions. Participants played a HI-LO game with a virtual partner, choosing payoffs based on grasping movements toward invisible large and small targets. Hand movements were presented as schematic animations, with partners grasping targets linked to higher or lower payoffs across two configurations. Participants relied exclusively on kinematic cues from hand shape changes in maximum grip aperture to infer their partner's choices. There were two main findings. While participants preferred higher payoffs consistent with rational game-theoretic expectations, reliable kinematic cues overrode these expectations. When early grip aperture changes indicated the partner was reaching for a large target associated with a lower payoff, participants abandoned their default preference for higher payoffs. They chose the lower option instead, achieving a high coordination success rate. These findings demonstrate that people prioritize kinematic cues about others' choices over theoretical assumptions about rational behavior when coordinating. This suggests that movement-based inferences about others' actions in natural social interactions may be weighted more heavily than strategic reasoning when the two sources of information conflict.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Their ability to have a compatible existence with their host has led to research into the potential therapeutic effects of helminth-derived molecules for suppression of overactive immune and inflammatory responses in a wide variety of diseases. This systematic review aims to synthesize the published data on helminth-derived peptides/polypeptides (HDPs) with a focus on determining the extent to which they modulate the inflammatory response in in vitro cellular models of inflammation. In accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a predefined systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science and Medline databases identified relevant studies published up to August 2025, and 79 articles were included after screening. We found that most published studies used LPS or Concanavalin A stimulated macrophages, peripheral blood mononuclear cells or dendritic cells as the cellular model of inflammation. Twenty helminth species from which >60 isolated HDPs were derived were tested in these models, with the nematodes, Haemonchus contortus and Acanthocheilonema viteae, and the trematode, Fasciola hepatica, the most explored species. A common property of these molecules was to ability to significantly reduce the expression or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, IL-1{beta}, IL-6 and TNF, and significantly increase the expression or production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, TGF{beta} and IL-4. The effects on other cytokines, including IFN{gamma} which is known to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, were less consistent, with HDPs either decreasing or increasing the levels of this cytokine. This systematic review synthesizes the existing literature in this field and shows that the HDPs secreted by several helminth species have consistently demonstrated effects though modification of cytokine levels and, as such, have therapeutic potential in conditions in which overactive immune and inflammatory responses play a pathogenic role.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

To investigate the expression and clinical relevance of non-traditional biomarkers of renal injury and endothelial activation in acute and chronic CD in the Brazilian Amazon. A cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2021 and July 2023 at the Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD), Manaus, Amazonas. Seventy-eight native Amazonian patients diagnosed with CD were evaluated and grouped by disease clinical phase: G1a (acute pre-treatment), G1b (acute post-treatment), G2a (chronic indeterminate), and G2b (chronic cardiac). Blood and urine levels of SYN-1, ANG-2, MCP-1, and NGAL were quantified using ELISA and correlated with traditional markers; including creatinine, urea, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Biomarkers were elevated across CD phases, despite traditional renal function parameters remaining within normal ranges. Urinary MCP-1 was significantly increased in the acute pre-treatment phase, reflecting early renal inflammation. SYN-1 was elevated in the acute and chronic indeterminate phases, indicating early endothelial activation. NGAL was increased in the chronic indeterminate group and ANG-2 in the chronic phase, suggesting progressive endothelial dysfunction. Traditional markers did not correlate with the biomarkers, suggesting their sensitivity in detecting early subclinical injury. This study highlights the importance of using these biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring of CD in the Amazon region. The elevated levels of SYN-1, ANG-2, MCP-1, and NGAL reveal early renal and endothelial dysfunction in CD patients undetectable by conventional tests.

Treatment of E. faecium infections is complicated by antibiotic resistance, making it important to understand resistance mechanisms and their broader consequences in this pathogen. Here we explored the collateral effects of rifampin resistance-associated mutations in the E. faecium RNA polymerase {beta}-subunit (RpoB). Of 14,384 publicly available E. faecium genomes, nearly one-third carried a mutation in the rifampin resistance-determining region (RRDR) of RpoB. In a local population of 710 E. faecium clinical isolates collected from patients at a single hospital, we found significant associations between the presence of RRDR mutations and prior exposure to rifamycin antibiotics, as well as associations between RRDR mutations and altered daptomycin susceptibility. To investigate the phenotypic impacts of RRDR mutations, we generated and studied four isogenic strains with distinct RRDR mutations (Q473K, G482D, H486Y, S491L) that overlapped with clinical isolate variants. Transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses revealed allele-specific effects on E. faecium gene expression, growth dynamics, antibiotic susceptibility, isopropanol tolerance, and cell wall physiology. One frequently observed mutation, H486Y, caused minimal transcriptional changes and enhanced bacterial fitness under antibiotic stress. In contrast, the S491L mutation induced extensive transcriptional changes and slowed bacterial growth, but also conferred increased isopropanol tolerance, potentially enhancing bacterial survival in the hospital. Overall, our findings highlight the multifaceted impacts of RRDR mutations in shaping E. faecium physiology and antibiotic resistance, two important features of this hospital-associated pathogen.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

One major group, the Bacilladnaviridae family of single-stranded DNA viruses, infects diatoms in marine environments. Here, we present the capsid structure of Chaetoceros lorenzianus DNA virus (ClorDNAV, Protobacilladnavirus chaelor) determined at 2.2 [A] resolution, thereby expanding the known structural diversity within the Cressdnaviricota phylum. The ClorDNAV capsid protein (CP) contains a conserved jelly-roll fold and a surface-exposed projection domain, with both N- and C-termini oriented toward the capsid interior. A low-resolution reconstruction of the genome revealed a spooled arrangement of the outer DNA layer, similar to that observed in Chaetoceros tenuissimus DNA virus type II (CtenDNAV-II). Structural comparison with CtenDNAV-II revealed five key CP differences: the absence of surface-exposed C-terminal tails in ClorDNAV, the presence of a helical domain, differences in the projection domain conformation, variation in the number of {beta}-strands in the jelly-roll fold, and the lack of ion-attributed densities at subunit interfaces. Together with the genome reconstruction, these findings underscore the importance of experimentally determined structures for understanding viral architecture and evolution. To complement these results, we analyzed AlphaFold3-predicted CPs from all classified Bacilladnaviridae genera. These models confirmed the conservation of the jelly-roll fold across the family while revealing variability in the surface-exposed and terminal regions, likely reflecting host-specific adaptations and genome packaging strategies. Together, the experimental and predicted structures provide a comprehensive view of structural conservation and divergence in Bacilladnaviridae. Furthermore, the results provide additional structural evidence for the evolution of ssDNA Bacilladnaviridae from a noda-like ssRNA virus ancestor and suggest a shared genome organization within Bacilladnaviridae that resembles those observed in viruses with double-stranded genomes.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Genotype imputation is commonly applied to study genotype-phenotype correlations in medical and population genetics, and has a great - yet unexplored - potential in a forensic context. Forensic DNA phenotyping, i.e., the prediction of phenotypic traits based on SNPs, can greatly benefit from imputing missing DNA markers necessary for utilising available prediction models and implementing novel prediction models. Currently however, most imputation studies investigate the performance of random SNPs with limited focus on SNPs involved in phenotypic expression or association. In the current study, individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project with high predicted trait diversity were used to explore the imputation accuracy of SNPs leveraged in phenotype prediction models and SNPs associated with facial traits compared to all SNPs. Further, the performance of the HIrisPlex-S prediction model for phenotypic traits was investigated using different imputed datasets. Firstly, we were able to corroborate that the number and selection of SNPs in the genotype dataset and the mino allele frequency (MAF) are major drivers of imputation call and error rates. Secondly, we explored increased imputation errors for phenotypic SNPs compared to randomly selected SNPs due to MAF differences. Further, we corroborated findings on lower imputation error rates for SNPs in coding regions due to increased linkage compared to non-coding regions. When investigating the impact of imputation on the performance of trait prediction using the HIrisPlex-S prediction model, we observed that datasets with more genotyped SNPs and phenotypes with more observations in the reference panel improved the prediction of these phenotypes. Finally, we showed novel insights into the improved trait prediction when applying more lenient calling thresholds for SNP imputation due to the detrimental impact of missing genotypes on trait prediction accuracy compared to imputation errors. Our findings, which show different imputation performances for general compared to phenotype-associated and prediction-model SNPs, highlight the importance of investigating imputation performances for the SNPs of interest. Further, we reported optimal trait predictions using lenient calling threshold of imputed SNP genotypes paired with a SNP panel with high linkage, which shows the high applicability of SNP imputation for phenotypic trait predictions.

Interestingly, the m54.5 ORF is expressed from its own transcript (m54.5 RNA) with early gene expression kinetics, and at much higher levels than M54. In this study, we show that m54.5 encodes a nuclear viral protein (m54.5p) that contributes to cell cycle regulation during lytic MCMV infection. We show that m54.5p interacts with components of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and the phosphatase-6 (PP6) complex. Nocodazole mitotic arrest assays confirmed G1 cell cycle arrest and dysregulation by m54.5. Serum starvation revealed impaired cell cycle progression to S-phase. Notably, m54.5p is not conserved in other cytomegaloviruses but functionally mimics the UL21a protein of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which similarly targets the master cell cycle regulator APC/C to disrupt cell cycle progression. m54.5 thus represents convergent evolution to HCMV UL21a in MCMV within the highly conserved viral DNA polymerase gene. Nevertheless, we found that m54.5p is dispensable for viral replication in cultured mouse fibroblasts, indicative of redundant cell cycle regulation in lytic MCMV infection.

We demonstrate that light-saturated photosynthetic rates (Asat) in middle and bottom layers at key growth stages can be strong predictors of grain yield. Despite variability in architecture across layers, light interception remained similar and key associations between biomass accumulation and yield with Asat emerged. Yield showed positive associations with photosynthesis in all canopy layers but was stronger at the top layer during grain filling and at the bottom layer during booting. Whole canopy photosynthetic rates were influenced by top layer architecture, N availability in the middle and bottom layers and leaf angles at the bottom of the canopy.

Combined with RenSeq-based association genetics, this approach allowed us to reconstruct the entire H1 locus, including recombination points at both the 5' and 3' ends of the interval.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

In seed plants, strigolactone perception begins with the enzyme-receptor DWARF14 (D14), an /{beta}-hydrolase that is believed to have evolved via gene duplication from the karrikin receptor, KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2). D14 and KAI2 are highly homologous at the sequence and structural levels, and both proteins bind and cleave similar butenolide compounds. Nevertheless, the two signalling pathways are distinct, as the activity of one receptor cannot compensate for the loss of the other. Here, we apply ancestral sequence reconstruction to generate a D14 protein representative of seed plants to study the evolution of substrate specificity, and to explore desirable traits for protein engineering. We describe the structure, as well as the in vitro and in planta activity of ancestral D14, showing that substrate specificity does not meaningfully differ from that of Arabidopsis thaliana D14. We also demonstrate that ancestral D14 shows higher recombinant yields, greatly increased thermostability, and enhanced catalytic activity relative to D14 from A. thaliana. This work provides insight into the evolution of phytohormone signalling and presents a robust scaffold for the application of D14-type proteins in synthetic biology.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Methods: Plasma from 32 ART-naive PWH, 53 ART-treated PWH, and 32 HIV-negative controls was analyzed for IgG autoantibodies and markers of S. aureus translocation. Causality was examined in EcoHIV-infected mice administered PGN from S. aureus or Bacillus subtilis. PGN structure was analyzed via mass spectrometry. Results: Among 87 autoantibodies, 40% were elevated in ART-naive PWH and largely normalized by ART; however, anti-CD4 IgGs remained elevated in PWH on ART. Anti-CD4 IgG levels inversely correlated with CD4+ T cell counts in ART-treated PWH and positively with S. aureus translocation. In mice, S. aureus PGN induced anti-CD4 IgGs, reduced gut CD4+ T cells, and promoted surface IgG binding and apoptosis in CD4+ T cells.

Mathematical modelling is well-placed to capture the dynamics of MS and provide insight into disease aetiology. In this work, we present a minimal model for MS disease onset and progression driven by inflammation and demyelination. The model dynamics are capable of describing a typical evolution of the illness, with changes from a healthy state to a diseased scenario captured by certain ranges of parameter values. Our model also describes the non-uniform oscillatory nature of the disease, born from a Hopf bifurcation due to the strength of the inflammatory response. In particular, using experimental data for Contrast Enhancing Lesions obtained from MS patients, we are able to reproduce some of the typical relapsing-remitting behaviours of this disease.

The biotic (weed, disease, and insect-pests) and abiotic stresses have significantly reduced the production and productivity of pigeonpea. Helicoverpa armigera, also known as pod borer, is a major pest in pigeonpea. A substantial investigations needed for comprehending the genetic and genomic underpinnings of resistance to H. armigera. Genetic improvement by genomics-assisted breeding (GAB) is an effective approach for developing high yielding H. armigera resistance cultivars. Still yet, no genetic markers and genes linked to this key trait have been detected in pigeonpea. In this context, a set of 146 pigeonpea minicore accessions were evaluated for four H. armigera resistance component traits namely pod borer resistance (PBR), days to 50% flowering (DF), days to maturity (DM), and grain yield (GY) for three consecutive seasons under field conditions. Results: Phenotypic data of pod borer resistance and component traits, along with the whole-genome resequencing (WGRS) data for 4,99,980 SNPs, were utilized to perform multi-locus genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis. Two models (SUPER, and FarmCPU) detected 14 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for PBR and three component traits. The MTAs with significant effect were mainly identified on chromosomes CcLG02, CcLG04, CcLG05, CcLG07 and CcLG11. These MTAs subsequently delineated with key candidate genes associated with pod borer resistance (Probable carboxylesterase 15, microtubule-associated protein 5, FAR1-RELATED SEQUENCE, and Omega-hydroxypalmitate O-feruloyl transferase 4), days to maturity (RING-H2 finger protein ATL7 and Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase), and grain yield (Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein, and Glutaredoxin-C5 chloroplastic). Conclusion: These research findings reported significant MTAs and candidate genes associated with pod borer resistance and component traits. Further lab-based pod bioassay screening identified four minicore accessions, namely ICP 10503, ICP 655, ICP 9691 and ICP 9655 (moderately resistance genotypes), showing least damage rating and larval weight gain %, compared to the susceptible checks. After validating the significant MTAs, the associated SNP markers can be effectively utilised in indirect selection, which offers potential gains for such quantitative traits with low heritability and can improve insect management more sustainably. The significant MTAs, candidate genes and resistant accessions, reported in this study may be utilized for the development of pod borer-resistant pigeonpea varieties.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Understanding and forecasting species adaptive responses to these environmental changes is therefore crucial for enhancing conservation efforts. In the Mediterranean Basin (MB), the average temperature is rising at a rate 20% faster than the global average, placing regional biodiversity at heightened risk. The study of local adaptation is thus particularly relevant. In the western MB, spontaneously occurring olive populations consist of both wild olives and admixed resulting of crop-to-wild gene flow. The wild is likely harbouring adaptive genetic variation shaped by local environmental pressures. In this study, we analysed target genomic sequencing data from spontaneously occurring populations (comprising both wild and admixed trees) as well as cultivated olive trees. We performed selective sweep and GEA analyses in wild olives to identify genomic regions associated with environmental variables. Our findings identified signatures of adaptation particularly associated with precipitation and temperature. Notably, admixed individuals retained many wild candidate SNPs in their genomes suggesting that they might retain a certain level of adaptation to their local environment.

Such metrics are even more important in megadiverse countries of the Global South, where conservation spending is limited despite high conservation value. Here, we reassess global avian threatened evolutionary history with an updated phylogeny, using the EDGE metric. The EDGE metric or score combines evolutionary distinctiveness of a species with its extinction risk. We focus on India to identify species and regions that represent high avian EDGE scores. We find that the Bengal Florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis) had the highest median EDGE score of 18.83 MY (millions of years). To identify spatial conservation priorities, we mapped avian EDGE scores at a 10 km x 10 km scale. Northeastern India is exceptional in its richness of evolutionary unique and threatened species. We also scored IBAs and PAs, finding that IBA, as well as PA, with the maximum EDGE score, was Intaki or Ntangki National Park in Nagaland, accumulating ~250 MY of threatened evolutionary history in India.

While recent T2T assemblies of humans and other primates have made substantial progress, most still contain thousands of base-level errors, particularly within highly repetitive regions. Here, we present T2T-MMU8v2.0, a near-perfect T2T assembly of the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), representing the highest base-level accuracy reported in a primate genome to date. By employing an optimized ONT-only assembly strategy, we identify subtelomeric satellite-rich regions as the principal bottleneck to improving assembly quality, owing to technological biases in long-read platforms and limitations in current hybrid assembly frameworks. We discover 268 previously unannotated repeat families and resolve ~8 Mbp of SATR satellite arrays, with over 99-fold enrichment in historically misassembled subtelomeric regions. These satellites form four distinct genomic architectures, each with unique SATR satellite composition, segmental duplication organization, and epigenetic signatures, distinct from the subtelomeric architectures observed in hominid genomes. Notably, in contrast to the largely gene-poor subtelomeric regions in African hominids, the SATR architectures in macaques harbor 58 actively transcribed genes, supported by open chromatin and expression data, suggesting gene innovation within these repetitive regions. Functionally, T2T-MMU8v2.0 improves read mappability and accuracy across sequencing platforms, and results in a 19% improvement of transcription start site enrichment scores and 5,821 additional chromatin accessibility peaks on average, thereby enhancing variant detection, regulatory annotation, and transcriptomic resolution in population genetics or single-nucleus studies.

Robustness analysis demonstrates that both the universal graph and time-resolved results are highly consistent across multiple sampling replicates.

Using comprehensive arteriovenous metabolomics in a highly relevant porcine I/R model, we report the metabolic landscape of cardiac metabolic changes after ischemia and during the reperfusion time course.

In addition to these findings, we identified several previously unrecognized changes in cardiac metabolic inputs and outputs during I/R, including nucleotides, TCA cycle intermediates and creatine/creatinine.

We demonstrate that E3 ligase dependency can be tuned both chemically and genetically.

Experimental validation of 12 AlphaVacc-generated variants of the BING-4 peptide confirmed that 11 showed increased HLA-A*02:01 binding and 7 elicited significant T cell responses. Further testing of 16 single-mutation peptides confirmed computational predictions for 15 candidates, exhibiting a remarkable success rate. AlphaVacc thus provides a powerful tool for designing neoantigen-based cancer vaccines and may accelerate personalized immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Currently, only two FDA-approved therapies exist: selumetinib, approved for pediatric patients with inoperable tumors, and mirdametinib, approved for patients aged two and older with symptomatic peripheral neuropathy where surgical resection is not possible. These limited options highlight the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies, including combination therapies and therapies applicable to adult populations. In this study, we introduce the Composite Matrix Reduction Score (CMRS), a novel algorithm designed to evaluate the in vitro efficacy of drug combinations for NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas. Using a high-throughput 6x6 combinatorial matrix, we screened three cell lines: ipnNF95.11c (NF1+/-, non-tumor reference), and two NF1-/- tumor lines: ipNF05.5mc and ipNF95.6. Cell viability responses to drug combinations were normalized to vehicle controls, and combination effects were compared to single-agent responses. Tumor-to-non-tumor response ratios were aggregated to generate a composite ranking for each drug pair. Our results show that certain drug combinations outperformed single agents in reducing tumor cell viability, consistent with findings in other cancers. A focused analysis on selumetinib combinations supported the CMRS algorithm and identified potential synergistic partners that may surpass a single-agent therapy, highlighting candidates for continued investigation. CMRS provides a scalable, standardized framework for prioritizing drug combinations in NF1 and potentially other cancers. By integrating multi-cell line analysis, this approach enhances the identification of promising therapeutic candidates and mechanisms of action for further preclinical development.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

In this study, we followed a cohort of close contacts of pulmonary TB patients with serial QFT testing at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months, and stratified them into six subgroups: QFT-increasing (low/high), QFT converters (QFT- to QFT+), QFT+ stable, and QFT- individuals. Despite these distinct QFT trajectories, we observed minimal differences in immune cell frequencies, activation profiles, and T helper subset distributions among the QFT subgroups, suggesting limited immunological stratification based on QFT dynamics alone. Ex vivo immune phenotyping, including analysis of CD4, CD8, and NKT cell frequencies, memory T cell subsets, and activated T cells (HLA-DR+CD38+), failed to distinguish between QFT subgroups. Antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses assessed by the activation-induced marker (AIM) assay were elevated in QFT+ compared to QFT- individuals. These findings suggest that blood-based immune profiling may not capture subtle immunological transitions among QFT converters or individuals with increasing QFT responses. In contrast, individuals with active TB (ATB) showed clear immune perturbations. ATB patients at diagnosis exhibited significantly elevated frequencies of antigen-specific CD4 T cells, increased activated T cells, and higher frequencies of intermediate monocytes and NK cells compared to QFT+/QFT- contacts. Many of these immune features declined with treatment, indicating therapy-associated immune resolution. Additionally, shifts in T helper subsets and effector memory populations were observed over the course of treatment. These results suggest that while ex vivo immune profiling can robustly distinguish active TB from non-diseased states, it lacks the resolution to differentiate QFT subgroups based on QFT dynamics alone. This could reflect either immunological similarity among close contacts regardless of QFT status or limitations of blood-based phenotyping in detecting early or subclinical immune shifts. Our study highlights the challenge of immunologically distinguishing QFT-defined subgroups within close contacts using conventional ex vivo profiling approaches", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Currently, no reliable vaccine against pulmonary tuberculosis, the primary adult disease caused by Mtb infection, exists. CD4 T cells are essential in protection against Mtb infection and inducing a protective CD4 T cell response remains the goal of most Mtb vaccines currently in testing. However, most Mtb T cell antigens do not exhibit antigenic variation, suggesting that T cell recognition does not drive selection of escape mutants. We utilized a set of antigens that do exhibit sequence diversity within human T cell epitopes and tested the impact of vaccination with these rare variable antigens (RVMA) using a DNA vaccine platform. We found vaccination with RVMA significantly alters the immune response to Mtb infection in both C57BL/6 and hypersusceptible SP140-/- mice without reducing bacterial burdens. RVMA vaccination of hypersusceptible SP140-/- animals prevented necrosis and altered the lesion composition reducing tissue damage and increasing CD4 T cell distribution. Reductions in pathology were associated with increases in ROR{gamma}t-expressing CD4 T cells and decreases in monocyte-derived cells in the lungs prior to the development of necrotic lesions. These results suggest T cell responses to certain antigens may be involved in preventing pathology without significantly changing bacterial burdens.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Although these blooms collapse synchronously, only 10-30% of algal cells show active viral infection, suggesting additional mortality agents. Using microbial communities from natural coccolithophore blooms, we discovered that bacteria significantly enhanced virus-mediated algal mortality. We quantified this interaction using two novel metrics: the Synergy Index (SI) measuring viral-bacterial interaction strength, and the Benefit Index (BI) assessing changes in bacterial fitness. We identified Alteromonas bacteria as drivers of viral-bacterial coinfection, with consistently high SI and BI. In natural communities, Alteromonas exhibited chemoattraction towards infected algal cells, leading to their enrichment in bloom demise particles. This viral-bacterial synergy represents a previously unrecognized mortality agent controlling bloom termination, modulating the balance between the carbon-recycling viral shunt and the carbon-exporting viral shuttle pathways, likely influencing global carbon cycling.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have described two seemingly contradictory phenomena--increasing prevalence of capsule-overproducing clinical isolates and frequent isolation of capsule-deficient variants. The biological significance of these phenomena remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed a clinical isolate, OCU_Ac16b, which spontaneously gives rise to two phenotypically distinct variants: the L type forming large colonies with an extremely thick capsule, and the S type forming small colonies with a substantially reduced or absent capsule. When L-type cells were cultured in test tubes under low-shaking conditions, S-type variants reproducibly emerged, constituting 45-80% of the population within 24 hours. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that this conversion is driven by distinct mutations in the capsular polysaccharide synthesis cluster, including insertion sequence (IS) insertions and a single-nucleotide deletion. PCR analysis confirmed that IS insertions in wzy (polysaccharide polymerase) occur within individual L-type colonies prior to liquid culture, providing a likely explanation for the rapid and reproducible emergence of S-type variants. Phenotypic characterization demonstrated a biological trade-off, with L-type cells exhibiting enhanced resistance to serum killing, desiccation, and certain {beta}-lactam antibiotics, whereas S-type cells showed superior surface attachment, increased biofilm formation, and a growth advantage under oxygen-limited conditions. Our findings uncover a highly reproducible, mutation-driven capsule switching mechanism that enables rapid phenotypic adaptation to changing environments.

B.", "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg2+) is vital for bacterial survival, and its homeostasis is tightly regulated. Intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) often face host-mediated magnesium limitation, which can be counteracted by upregulating the expression of Mg2+-transporters. This upregulation may be via Mg2+-sensing regulatory RNA such as the Bacillus subtilis ykoK Mbox riboswitch, which acts as a transcriptional OFF-switch under high Mg2+ conditions. Mtb encodes two Mbox elements with strong similarity to the ykoK Mbox. In the current study, we characterize the Mbox encoded upstream of the Mtb pe20 operon, which is required for growth in low Mg2+ combined with low pH. We show that this switch operates via a translational expression platform and Rho-dependent transcription termination, which is the first such case reported for an Mbox. Moreover, we show that the switch directly controls a small ORF (uORF2) encoded upstream of pe20. We have annotated this highly expressed and highly conserved uORF as rv1805A, but its role remains unclear. Interestingly, a homologous gene exists outside the Mbox-regulated context, suggesting functional importance beyond magnesium stress. Overall, this study uncovers another dual mechanism of riboswitch regulation in Mtb, combining translational control with Rho-mediated transcription termination, similar to the Mtb B12-switches.

MNPs provide a more efficient, faster, cost-effective, and sustainable method compared to traditional chromatography. In this work, we report the development and validation of a magnetic nanoparticle-based platform for the efficient, selective, and scalable purification of His6 recombinant proteins. The synthesized Ni2+-functionalized MNPs demonstrated high specificity for histidine-tagged proteins, as shown by the selective retention and imidazole-mediated elution of target proteins both from pre-purified samples and complex E. coli lysates. Comparative assays with bovine serum albumin and His6 protein A confirmed the selective affinity of the MNPs for His6. Furthermore, a scaled-up protocol using 4 mL of lysate yielded approximately 0.6 mg/mL of purified protein, doubling the output obtained via conventional immobilized metal affinity chromatography, while preserving purity.

Whole-genome sequencing of the evolved strain identified SNPs in ZWF1, a component of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and in the G1 cyclin gene CLN3, both of which were functionally validated through CRISPR and reverse engineering. The zwf1E191D mutation reduced xylitol accumulation, alleviating inhibition of xylose isomerase and enhancing flux through the non-oxidative branch of the PPP, while the frameshift cln3T556fs mutation unexpectedly improved acetic acid tolerance and xylose consumption in the evolved strain, also affecting cell size and growth. Genome sequencing of AceY.14 also revealed a significant reduction in the xylA gene copy number, likely decreasing the metabolic burden associated with high xylose isomerase expression. A synergistic effect was observed in the double mutant lacking both ISU1 and ZWF1, further boosting xylose consumption rates.

Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins induce endothelial hyperpermeability, contributing to severe complications. Here we explored the potential of a panel of 18 CDs in mitigating endothelial dysfunction caused by these viral proteins and evaluated the CDs' antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. The effect of CDs on endothelial hyperpermeability was assessed using a trans-endothelial electrical resistance assay with human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS1 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins. Antiviral efficacy of CDs was evaluated in Vero cells infected with DENV2 and Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, and in vivo protection was assessed in a lethal DENV2 mouse model. CDs effectively inhibited DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability in vitro, demonstrating their potential to counteract NS1-mediated barrier disruption. In the murine model, CD1 treatment provided partial protection against DENV-induced morbidity and mortality. Further, CDs significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and inhibited Spike-induced endothelial dysfunction. These findings indicate that CDs can prevent endothelial hyperpermeability induced by DENV NS1 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins and exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, positioning them as promising candidates for mitigating endothelial complications associated with viral infections.

In this study, we collected data from 84 individuals engaged in live conversations. Participants' prefrontal brain activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning, and functional connectivity was quantified via wavelet transform coherence. Dialogues were manually transcribed, and computational methods were applied to extract emotional and semantic/syntactic features from the speech data. Using linear mixed-effects models, we found that emotional content significantly predicted prefrontal functional connectivity (R^2 marginal = 0.04). Among all emotional predictors, expressed anger was the most robust: higher anger levels were associated with reduced connectivity between the left middle frontal gyrus and the right inferior frontal gyrus (q = .032, R^2 marginal = 0.07). While other semantic and syntactic features did not predict overall connectivity, degree assortativity - an index of linguistic structure - was negatively associated with connectivity between the superior frontal gyri and the left inferior frontal gyrus (q = .026, R^2 marginal = 0.08).

A minimum of 60 minutes of fMRI BOLD data with an auditory oddball paradigm were collected in ten infants with a mean postmenstrual age of 48 weeks. Results demonstrate the feasibility of performing a precision functional imaging study to investigate individual specific responses to salient stimuli in infants. While responses to the auditory oddball were consistent between individuals in auditory processing areas, responses across the rest of the brain differed across individuals in their magnitude and shape. Individual specific response patterns appeared to be relatively stable and differed from other participant's response patterns, despite fluctuations across runs. Commonalities and differences between individuals demonstrated in this sample contribute to our understanding of how the developing brain instantiates processing of salient stimuli.

Here, we explored endo-lysosomal dynamics that are associated with the generation of the apicosome, the earliest stage of lumen formation in a model of human epiblast development based on human pluripotent stem cells. We uncovered a hybrid early/late endosome compartment as well as a previously unrecognized dynamics of late endosome and lysosome compartments in trafficking podocalyxin (PODXL), a sialomucin glycoprotein that helps to establish and maintain the open lumen, during apicosome formation. To gain molecular insight into these unique hybrid endosome and late endosome/lysosome machineries in PODXL traffic, we used APEX2-based spatial proteomics to identify PODXL-proximity partners during apicosome formation, and identified RAB35, a Rab small GTPase known to control PODXL traffic as well as early and late endosome dynamics, as a key player in controlling apicosome formation. Our results suggest that RAB35 limits excess apicosome formation by promoting the early to late endosome transition as well as lysosome formation, which help to reduce PODXL to a level necessary for single apicosome formation.

E.; Leng, Y.; Goldbach, H. C.; Averbeck, B. B.; Alvarez, V. A.; Penzo, M. A.", "abstract": "Motivated behavior is often framed in terms of biologically grounded outcomes, such as food or threat. Yet many motivated actions, like the pursuit of safety or agency, depend on outcomes that lack explicit sensory value and must instead be inferred from experience. Here, we identify a thalamostriatal circuit mechanism by which such internally constructed outcomes acquire motivational value. In mice performing an active avoidance task, neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) develop a safety-encoding signal that emerges following successful avoidance. This signal is experience-dependent and value-sensitive, diminishing upon devaluation of the instrumental contingency. Selective silencing of the PVT[-&gt;]NAc projection at safety onset disrupts avoidance persistence without impairing action-outcome learning, as confirmed by computational modeling of value updating based on prediction error. Mechanistically, PVT input recruits cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to modulate dopamine release and this influence depends on synaptic potentiation mediated by GluA2-lacking AMPA receptor insertion at PVT-CIN synapses. Disrupting this plasticity selectively impairs the avoidance response by blunting the motivational value of safety without affecting acquisition. These findings reveal how thalamic circuits assign value to abstract, internal outcomes, providing a framework for understanding how goals like safety are inferred, stabilized, and rendered behaviorally effective.", "date": "2025-08-04", "journal": ""}
