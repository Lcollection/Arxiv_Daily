A central question across neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning, is whether learning relies on generative or discriminative strategies. Generative learners build internal models the sensory world itself, capturing its statistical structure; discriminative learners map stimuli directly onto choices, ignoring input statistics. These strategies rely on fundamentally different internal representations and entail distinct computational trade-offs: generative learning supports flexible generalisation and transfer, whereas discriminative learning is efficient but task-specific. We compared humans, rats, and mice performing the same auditory categorisation task, where category boundaries and rewards were fixed but sensory statistics varied. All species adapted their behaviour near-optimally, consistent with a normative observer constrained by sensory and decision noise. Yet their underlying algorithms diverged: humans predominantly relied on generative representations, mice on discriminative boundary-tracking, and rats spanned both regimes. Crucially, end-point performance concealed these differences, only learning trajectories and trial-to-trial updates revealed the divergence. These results show that similar near-optimal behaviour can mask fundamentally different internal representations, establishing a comparative framework for uncovering the hidden strategies that support statistical learning.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

In the last decades, clinical trials aiming to counteract the overexpression of AURKA turned out to be largely unsuccessful. Meanwhile, recent discoveries pointed at new functions of AURKA at the subcellular level, including at mitochondria. At this location, AURKA induces organelle clearance by mitophagy by acting in complex with the mitophagy mediator LC3, and its inner mitochondrial membrane receptor PHB2. The natural polyphenol xanthohumol was shown to act as a PHB2 ligand, altering the interaction between AURKA and PHB2 and restoring mitochondrial functions in cancer cells. However, its chemical nature prevents its broader use as an anti-cancer agent. Using Forster's Resonance Energy Transfer/Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FRET/FLIM) in live breast cancer cells, we here explore the effects of alternative PHB ligands in altering the proximity between AURKA and PHB2. Among the already-available compounds, we found that the pungent natural product capsaicin partially alters the AURKA/PHB2 protein-protein proximity. We then synthesized 16 novel capsaicin analogues to enhance the effects of capsaicin. We found that replacing the long hydrophobic acyl moiety by a butyryl one increases the AURKA/PHB2 interaction. Among the capsaicin derivatives carrying this modification, we uncover that compounds 12 and 13 enhance the AURKA/PHB2 proximity. Molecular docking approaches corroborate FRET/FLIM data, and we visualize compounds 12 and 13 in complex with AURKA, PHB2 and LC3. We show that compounds 12 and 13 stabilize the AURKA/PHB2 interaction, and that they can bind to the inhibitory pocket of PHB2 and to the AURKA active site. Finally, we report that compound 13 specifically inhibits AURKA-dependent mitophagy, while leaving the activation of AURKA unaltered at centrosomes. Together, our data demonstrate that compound 13 is a promising PHB ligand acting on the AURKA/PHB2 interaction. Thanks to its specificity toward the mitochondrial roles of AURKA, it may provide the basis for the development of new anticancer drugs targeting the mitochondrial functions of AURKA.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Background: The outer mitochondrial Rho GTPase 1, MIRO1, mediates mitochondrial motility within cells, but implications for vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) physiology and its roles in vascular diseases, such as neointima formation following vascular injury are widely unknown. Methods: Carotid ligation was performed in an in vivo model of selective Miro1 deletion in smooth muscle cells. VSMC proliferation during the cell cycle and molecular mechanisms of smooth muscle cell proliferation were explored in cultured aortic VSMCs by imaging mitochondrial positioning and cristae structure and assessing the effects on ATP production, metabolic function, and interactions with components of the electron transport chain (ETC). MIRO1 expression was also analyzed in human coronary arteries, and its function was assessed via knockdown in human coronary artery VSMCs. Results: MIRO1 was highly expressed in VSMCs within human atherosclerotic plaques. MIRO1 facilitated VSMC proliferation and neointima formation by regulating mitochondrial positioning and PDGF-stimulated ATP production and respiration, critical for cell-cycle progression at G1/S. Deletion of Miro1 disrupted mitochondrial cristae structure, diminished ETC complex I activity, and impaired supercomplex formation. Notably, restoring MIRO1 function with expression of wild type MIRO1 recovered proliferation and ATP production and respiration, whereas a mutant lacking EF hands, which are essential for mitochondrial motility, only partially rescued these effects. MIRO1 knockdown in human coronary artery VSMCs confirmed its pivotal role in mitochondrial function and VSMC proliferation. Conclusions: This study highlights two key mechanisms by which MIRO1 regulates VSMC proliferation. First, it maintains ATP synthesis by preserving mitochondrial cristae integrity. Second, its Ca2+-dependent EF hands enable ATP-dependent mitochondrial positioning. By linking mitochondrial motility and energy production to VSMC physiology, these findings position MIRO1 as a critical regulator of vascular remodeling and a potential target for therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Using high-temporal-resolution imaging, polymer modelling, and in vitro approaches with a separation-of-function mutant smc5-2KE, we demonstrate that microtubules binding by Smc5/6 constrains chromatin dynamics and promotes pericentromeric folding. The smc5-2KE mutant, combined with a hypomorphic kinetochore mutant (Mtw1-3xGFP), leads to spindle and cytokinesis defects and triggers the spindle checkpoint.

One major obstacle is that distinct pathologies may currently be diagnosed as the same disease and prescribed the same treatments. The key to developing antidepressants with ubiquitous efficacy is to first identify a strategy to differentiate between heterogeneous conditions. Major depression is characterized by hallmark features such as anhedonia and a loss of motivation, and it has been recognized that even among inbred mice raised under identical housing conditions, we observe heterogeneity in their susceptibility and resilience to stress. Anhedonia, a condition identified in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, is described as the inability to experience pleasure and is linked to anomalous medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity. The mPFC is responsible for higher order functions, such as valence encoding; however, it remains unknown how mPFC valence-specific neuronal population activity is affected during anhedonic conditions. To test this, we implemented the unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol in mice and examined hedonic behaviors following stress and ketamine treatment. We used unsupervised clustering to delineate individual variability in hedonic behavior in response to stress. We then performed in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to longitudinally track mPFC valence-specific neuronal population dynamics during a Pavlovian discrimination task. Chronic mild stress mice exhibited a blunted effect in the ratio of mPFC neural population responses to rewards relative to punishments after stress that rebounds following ketamine treatment. Also, a linear classifier revealed that we can decode susceptibility to chronic mild stress based on mPFC valence-encoding properties prior to stress-exposure and behavioral expression of susceptibility. Lastly, we used a markerless pose tracking computer vision tool, SLEAP, to predict whether a mouse would become resilient or susceptible based on facial expressions during a Pavlovian discrimination task. These results indicate that mPFC valence encoding properties and behavior are predictive of anhedonic states. Altogether, these experiments point to the need for increased granularity in the measurement of both behavior and neural activity, as these factors can predict the predisposition to stress-induced anhedonia.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

I.; Kozin, V. V.", "abstract": "Segmentation is one of the most striking features of bilaterians, and understanding its mechanisms provides insights into the evolution of body plans. In annelids, segmentation occurs at different developmental stages through a variety of processes, yet the molecular pathways remain underexplored. Aiming to compare segmentation patterns in ontogeny and phylogeny, we analysed the expression of Avi-en (homologous to engrailed) and Avi-wnt1 in the nereidid polychaete Alitta virens. Using in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and cell proliferation assays, we mapped the spatiotemporal expression of these genes across embryonic, larval, and postlarval stages. We found that Avi-en was expressed in solid lateral domains early in the unsegmented protrochophore stage and progressed through a metameric pattern, while Avi-wnt1 expression appeared later, also aligning with segmental boundaries. At the nectochaete stage, the posterior domain of Avi-en expression in the growth zone expanded and split into two due to increased cell proliferation. The postlarval segment primordium then developed progressively, culminating in the activation of Avi-wnt1 at the posterior border. According to available published data, the revealed pattern of gradual segment formation is unique to nereidids. The observed divergence in gene expression and cell proliferation across annelids suggests that segmentation in bilaterians did not arise from a common ancestral mechanism.

This work introduces a Thermodynamically Explicit (TDE) kinetic framework to bridge this gap by constructing dynamic metabolic models grounded in fundamental thermodynamic principles. Our approach uses standard chemical potentials to derive simplified rate laws for metabolic reactions, reducing the kinetic complexity of each reaction to a single, biochemically determined prefactor ({lambda}), which we will name kinetic capacity factor. The number of parameters in the suggested TDE kinetics is indeed minimal in the sense that it uses the lowest possible number of free parameters required to define a reaction rate that is both dynamic and thermodynamically consistent. We demonstrate the validity and practical application of this framework by re-parameterizing a well-established kinetic model of glycolysis. The resulting TDE model successfully reproduces the dynamic behavior of the original, more complex model in simulations. By streamlining the parameterization process, the TDE kinetic framework offers a powerful and scalable tool for building genome-wide dynamic metabolic models. This approach paves the way for more accurate and predictive simulations of metabolic behavior, with significant potential for applications in systems biology, medicine, and biotechnology.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Yet, microbiome-mediated impacts of global change on metabolic health have received little attention. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease with rapidly increasing global prevalence, uncertain pathogenesis and influences from gut microbiome-host interactions and environmental factors. Soil microbiomes shift in composition and functional capacity with ecosystem condition and are important for supplementing the human gut microbiome and contributing to food quality, both of which are critical in metabolism. Here, we sought to examine overlapping functional capacities in model case study microbiome datasets from (1) soils from a gradient of ecosystem quality (from highly disturbed to mature/natural sites under forest ecosystem restoration) and (2) gut microbiomes in T2D versus normal health to investigate plausible links between ecosystem degradation and metabolic anomalies encoded in T2D gut microbiomes. We developed a novel method to translate microbiome functional capacities (i.e., functional gene-associated biochemical pathway relative abundances) to 'compound processing potential' (CPP, %), reflecting the potential metabolism of individual compounds. Examining selected compounds relevant to soil and gut health, and via exhaustive compound-wide trend analyses, we identified compounds that shared potential metabolism trends. We found increased potential metabolism for sugars and decreased potential metabolism for lignin and monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids, in both T2D and degraded ecosystems. These trends were confirmed in separate T2D case study cohorts from Sweden and China, and degraded versus more natural biodiverse soil-plant systems in the United States and Australia, suggesting a generalizable pattern. Our findings support a consequential new hypothesis that excessive exposures to degraded ecosystem soil microbiomes, and/or nutrient-depleted food derived from such systems, may distort gut microbiome functional capacities and metabolism and thereby contribute to type 2 diabetes.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Mechanistically, BIRC5 deletion in AML restored caspase-9 and -3/7 activity and downregulated other IAPs, implicating BIRC5 as the central post-mitochondrial regulator for blocking apoptosis. p53 stabilization suppressed BIRC5 selectively in TP53 wild-type AML, explaining BIRC5 upregulation in TP53 mutant lines and AML primary tumors (n > 700). Longitudinal single-cell RNAseq (n = 22 pairs) revealed expansion of BIRC5high stem and progenitor leukemia clones in TP53 mutant AML patients post-VenAza therapy. Survivin and IAP inhibitors emerged as top combination partners with VenAza in TP53 mutant AML cells and showed potent in vivo leukemic blast inhibition in xenograft models and primary tumors. Beyond AML, BIRC5 was upregulated broadly across 17 of 25 TP53 mutant cancers in the TCGA cohort, and combination with survivin inhibitors overcame chemotherapy resistance in TP53 deficient triple negative breast and colorectal cancers.

C.; Hawkes, K.; Kim, P.", "abstract": "Humans are distinguished from our closest living relatives, other great apes, by our extended postmenopausal longevity, later first births, and shorter birth intervals. Those features likely evolved as ancestral grandmothers' foraging subsidised dependents in habitats lacking foods that youngsters could manage for themselves. If so, as female post-fertile years increased, older years increased in males too. Those still-fertile old males in the paternity competition pushed average male reproductive success below the female average. According to R. A. Fisher, Mendelian inheritance requires equal contributions from both sexes to descendant gene pools. Higher average reproductive success in one sex makes tendencies to overproduce it pass to more grandchildren, equalizing averages in descendant generations. Yet, men's lower average reproductive success persists, their fertility lasting decades longer than women's. Here, we present a simple mathematical model to investigate this phenomenon. We show that a male-biased adult sex ratio is consistent with an offspring sex ratio of 1:1. Assuming a stable age distribution, we show that if male fertile careers are twice as long as those of females, the corresponding reproductive value of males is larger than that of females, which acts to balance the effect of higher female reproductive success. We propose that extended male fertility balances the sex difference in average reproductive success, maintaining Fisher's equilibrium under human life history conditions.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

We show that symbionts are rapidly internalized across the epithelial boundary and elicit a swift and pronounced activation of innate immune transcription factors (TFs), including NFkB, IRF, and STAT, as well as associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and signaling pathways. Both IRF and NFkB quickly translocate to the nuclei of amoebocytes that are engulfing symbionts, consistent with conserved roles in host symbiont recognition. In contrast, non-symbiotic bacteria are internalized more slowly and fail to induce comparable immune activation or TF nuclear translocation. These results indicate that the last common ancestor of sponges and other animals already possessed a complex innate immune system capable of distinguishing among bacterial partners, suggesting that immune regulation of symbiosis is an ancient feature of animal evolution.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

In many experiments, infected plants are placed in direct contact with healthy ones assuming that CMV cannot be transmitted in this way. However, this has not been formally demonstrated.

The Drosophila melanogaster Cyclin G gene (CycG) encodes a transcriptional cyclin that regulates growth and the cell cycle. Over-expression of a potentially more stable isoform of the protein (deleted of a PEST-rich domain, hereafter called CycGP) induces extreme wing size and shape FA (i.e. high developmental noise), indicating a major disruption of developmental stability. Previous attempts to identify the genetic bases of FA have been impeded by the constitutively low level of developmental noise, strongly limiting the power to detect any effect. Here, we leverage the extreme developmental instability induced by overexpression of CycGP to explore the genetic bases of FA: we perform a genome-wide screen for deficiencies that enhance or reduce CycGP-induced wing FA. 499 deficiencies uncovering 90% of the euchromatic genome were combined with a recombinant chromosome expressing CycGP. We identified 13 and 16 deficiencies that enhance and decrease FA, respectively. Analysis of mutants for some genes located in these deficiencies shows that Cyclin G ensures homogeneous growth of organs in synergy with the major morphogens of the wing, Dpp and Wg, as well as the Hippo and InR/TOR pathways. They also reveal that CycGP-induced FA involves Larp, a potential direct interactor of Cyclin G, that regulates translation at the mitochondrial membrane.

These findings provide the first genomic insights into the U.S. Csp population, suggest the recent introduction of a single genetic lineage with a broad host range, and establish a framework for improved detection, monitoring, and management of VSD in woody ornamentals.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Its highly organized vascular system plays a crucial role in maintaining functional zonation and tissue homeostasis. Within the liver, the hepatic artery, portal vein, hepatic vein, bile duct, and nerve networks intertwine to form an intricate three-dimensional architecture; however, traditional two-dimensional imaging fails to reveal their true spatial relationships, and current three-dimensional imaging methods remain insufficient to capture fine structural details. To achieve comprehensive visualization of these multi-ductal systems, we established a high-resolution three-dimensional imaging platform that combines multicolor perfusion of metallic compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) with an optimized tissue-clearing protocol (Liver-CUBIC), enabling simultaneous 3D reconstruction of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile duct, and hepatic vein in mouse livers. Based on these data, we identified and defined a previously unrecognized structure located in the outer layer of the portal vein, termed the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC). The PLC encircles the portal vein between the vascular endothelium and the perisinusoidal region, exhibits low-permeability barrier characteristics, and contains a distinctive population of CD34;Sca-1; endothelial cells. During liver fibrosis, the PLC extends from the portal vein toward the hepatic lobule, forming a structural scaffold that guides bile duct and nerve migration.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

In bacterial populations, dN/dS often declines with the sequence divergence between strains, but the mechanisms responsible for this broad empirical trend are still debated. Existing models have primarily focused on de novo mutations, overlooking the older genetic variants that are continually introduced through horizontal gene transfer and recombination. Here we introduce a phenomenological model of dN/dS in recombining populations of bacteria, which allows us to disentangle the effects of recombination among pairs of closely related strains. We find that clonally inherited regions of the genome exhibit consistently higher dN/dS ratios, and that the accumulation of recombined segments can quantitatively explain the majority of the decline in dN/dS. We use these observations to re-examine models of purifying selection and adaptive reversion in human gut bacteria, and uncover evidence for widespread weak selection at a large fraction of protein coding sites. Our findings show that horizontal gene transfer can be an important factor in shaping genome-wide patterns of selective constraint, and raise new questions about the effectiveness of natural selection in complex bacterial populations.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Disorders such as Parkinson's disease disrupt these modes differently, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. Such differences could arise from specialized circuits dedicated to each action mode or from shared neuronal populations that shift their dynamics across contexts. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed two-photon calcium imaging in the dorsolateral striatum as mice executed the same lever press either spontaneously or in response to a cue, enabling direct comparison of internally and externally triggered actions. Unsupervised clustering revealed subpopulations of neurons modulated during cue, movement, or post-action periods. Critically, the same neurons were tuned to movement across initiation contexts. However, the dynamics of this shared population evolved within distinct \"context\" and \"action\" subspaces, even before movement initiation. Both dopamine D1- and D2-receptor-expressing spiny projection neurons contributed to both subspaces, with D1-SPNs more active at the time of the sensory stimulus. These results show that context shapes neural dynamics within a shared movement-encoding population, revealing a context-generalizable striatal code that supports flexible movement initiation across internal and external drives.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

The metabolomic capabilities of this phylum remain poorly characterised, with few experimentally confirmed metabolites described. To address these gaps, we combined metabolomic profiling with comparative genomic analysis to explore the functional potential of novel strains within the Acidobacteriaceae family. Genome mining across the phylum for PGPTs revealed the presence and taxon-specific enrichment of genes related to phytohormone production, as well as other genes associated with plant-growth-promoting effects. When tryptophan (Trp) was added to the cultivation medium, it triggered a strong metabolic response in the strains, resulting in measurable changes in the production levels of phytohormones such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-pyruvate (iP). Building on these findings, we examined the metabolic reprogramming caused by Trp supplementation, which suppressed the growth of phytopathogenic fungi, leading to the identification of malassezindoles and pityriacitrins as active agents. This was confirmed by isolating and elucidating the structure of pityriacitrin B and a methyl ester through NMR studies.

Current sequence-based models, such as Enformer and Borzoi, trained exclusively on the reference genome, cannot capture the effects of individual-specific regulatory variants. Moreover, the acquisition of paired whole-genome and transcriptome data required for personalized modeling is hindered by privacy and data-sharing constraints. To address this limitation, we integrate genomic data synthesis with established statistical frameworks. Our approach generates thousands of virtual training samples by simulating genetic variation from the 1000 Genomes Project and assigning pseudo-expression labels using PrediXcan, a validated eQTL-based predictor. Because simulated and real expression values differ in scale and distribution, we introduce a preference-based objective that models relative rather than absolute expression patterns. Fine-tuning Enformer through alternating cycles of real-data regression and virtual-data preference optimization enables efficient learning from both real and synthesized data. Using the GEUVADIS dataset, our framework outperforms AlphaGenome, PrediXcan, and Enformer fine-tuned without synthesized data, demonstrating that simulation-based integration of population-level regulatory knowledge can effectively mitigate data scarcity and improve cross-individual generalization in sequence-based gene expression prediction.

Rhythmic 10 Hz visual stimulation entrained the alpha phase at 0 degree or 180 degree relative to audiovisual target onset. Entrainment effects on multisensory integration only emerged when individual NBLFs, which were related to alpha phase coupling between early audio-visual cortices, were included in the analysis.

To determine whether this common organization reflects a shared genetic program or tissue-specific regulation, we assembled a comprehensive single-cell atlas of 14 murine Multilayered epithelia. We identified a conserved p63-Notch axis that universally governs basal cell identity maintenance and suprabasal commitment. The p63-centered transcriptional program is shared, while Notch signaling recruits context-specific transcriptional modules to generate functional diversity. The layered architecture of epithelia spatially and temporally decouples conserved basal from context-specific suprabasal networks, compartmentalizing functional innovation across multilayered epithelia. Comparative genomics traces the p63-Notch axis to the root of vertebrates over 500 million years ago, showing that it was repeatedly co-opted through the incorporation of newly evolved genes in the suprabasal domain to generate novel epithelial functions. Our work establishes that evolution of multilayered epithelia operates through modular, compartmentalized diversification of a conserved scaffold of a conserved architectural scaffold, providing a unifying principle for how complex tissues achieve functional innovation while preserving structural integrity.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Using a deep spatiotemporal sequence model trained on Long stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) trials, we identify Encoding, Central, and Response operations and show that these same operations occur in the Short SOA condition, demonstrating shared cognitive processes across interference conditions. Additionally, trial-level decoding reveals multiple distinct sequences of cognitive operations across both tasks during interference, varying both within and across individuals. These sequences predict behavioral differences in reaction time and accuracy, revealing how interference timing within the cognitive operation sequence influences performance.

However, the relationship between retinal degeneration and structural alterations along central visual pathways remains poorly understood. We investigated possible structural links across the retinocortical pathway in 15 genetically characterized RP patients (RHO, PDE6A, PDE6B mutations) compared with 22 healthy controls, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) combined with diffusion-weighted MRI and fixel-based analysis (FBA). Retinal segmentation revealed marked outer layer thinning (outer nuclear layer: -55% foveal, -77% parafoveal) with significant inner layer thickening at the fovea (inner plexiform layer +29%, inner nuclear layer +40%). Parafoveal regions showed near-complete photoreceptor loss but inner retinal thickness approaching normal values. FBA demonstrated significant fiber density reductions in optic tracts and optic radiations, without corresponding macrostructural changes in tract cross-section, suggesting early microstructural disruption preceding atrophy. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between parafoveal inner plexiform layer thickness and fiber density in both optic tracts (r=0.856) and radiations (r=0.768), with no correlations observed at the foveal level. These findings demonstrate complex, region-specific retinal remodeling in RP, likely reflecting Muller cell gliosis rather than mechanical compensation. The fiber density reduction without tract atrophy suggests trans-synaptic degeneration along visual pathways.

To understand how the nervous system negotiates these challenges, we derived a new learning principle, Hetlearn (Heterologous Learners), based on the physiology and multi-compartmental architecture of the Drosophila mushroom body, a key associative learning circuit. Hetlearn circumvents learning full causal models of the environment, making it less fragile to nonstationarity.

In addition to reducing ROS production and/or scavenging, boosting cellular anti-oxidant capacity is a potential strategy, with FB an interesting target. Methods: We interrogated single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from human failing and non-failing hearts to identify OS modulating genes. Differential gene expression analysis in FB and comparison with other cell types was used for identification of candidate genes. The functional role of the identified candidate was studied in primary isolated human FB in culture, using knock-down strategies and phenotype manipulation using TGF-{beta}1. Results: Across the different cardiac cell types, FB showed the greatest enrichment for OS-modulating genes downregulated in HF. Of these genes, the microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1), was exclusively expressed and downregulated in FB, inversely correlating with elevated ROS levels in HF tissue. TGF-{beta}1 treatment of non-HF FB reduced MGST1 expression. MGST1 knockdown in non-HF FB raised expression of periostin, but not of collagen. ROS production and susceptibility to oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation were also increased. Downregulation of ferroptosis-suppressing and iron-handling genes inversely correlated with MGST1 expression. Conclusion: Loss of MGST1 in HF is unique to FB, linked to FB activation. It impairs FB antioxidant capacity, exacerbating oxidative stress, and reduces resistance to ferroptosis. Through these mechanisms, loss of FB MGST1 induces a deleterious positive feedback on cardiac remodelling in human HF.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

How nuclear-import receptors (NIRs) antagonize this pathological transition has remained unresolved. Here, we establish that NIRs regulate the phase behavior of prion-like cargos by remodeling the dilute phase. Quantitative analyses across length scales reveal that Karyopherin-{beta}2 (Kap{beta}2) preferentially binds cargo in the dilute phase to lower the effective concentration of free RBPs thereby elevating the saturation concentration for phase separation and suppressing mesoscale clustering. ALS-linked FUSP525L, which binds Kap{beta}2 weakly, evades this regulation to form pathogenic assemblies. Thus, NIRs harness polyphasic linkage, the thermodynamic relationship between ligand binding and phase equilibria, to reshape the landscape of prion-like RBP assembly states, establishing a paradigm for how ATP-independent chaperones regulate phase behavior to prevent disease-linked aggregation.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Engineered with surface-displayed nanobodies, SimCells and mini-SimCells selectively bind bacteria expressing specific antigens (e.g., OmpA in E. coli).

Here, we introduce a biosensing approach using the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum as a living phenotypic sensor for hvKp virulence. Through a suite of quantitative assays integrating predation resistance, social development, and real-time single-cell motility tracking, we show that D. discoideum can discriminate avirulent, virulent, and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains.

Multivariate data integration revealed a clear segregation of virulence phenotypes, validating D. discoideum as a sensitive, scalable, and genetically tractable biosensor for functional virulence detection. This work establishes a conceptual and methodological framework for developing cell-based biosensors that report virulence levels through measurable host behavioral responses and outlines a calibration path to vertebrate endpoints.

Furthermore, the evolution of fungal MAT loci shares features with the evolution of sex chromosomes in plants and animals. Pathogenic Cryptococcus species harbor a bipolar system with a large contiguous MAT locus, whereas closely related species, such as the non-pathogen C. amylolentus possess a tetrapolar system with unlinked P/R and HD loci. The HD locus encodes homeobox domain containing proteins that play an important and evolutionarily conserved role in sexual reproduction.

With a CRISPR/Cas9 system we developed for C. amylolentus, we generated gene deletion mutants and demonstrated that a single compatible Sxi1/Sxi2 pair is necessary and sufficient for mating. By relocating the HD genes to the P/R locus, we found that the artificially generated bipolar configuration led to defective sexual development, which could be partially restored through additional rounds of sexual reproduction. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that a Sxi1/Sxi2 heterodimeric complex drives expression of genes required for DNA replication and ergosterol biosynthesis during sexual reproduction.

We highlight new information derived from this screen, including the identification of novel functions for previously uncharacterised conserved and essential genes (in mycolic acid and arabinogalactan synthesis), the discovery of a new drug scaffold/protein target pair, and insights into the mechanism of action of two commonly used antibiotics. These data are also a valuable resource for the mycobacterial research community, as they provide thousands of novel phenotypes for uncharacterized genes and meaningful phenotypic correlations between annotated and uncharacterized genes.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Inspired by the autoinhibitory state of GSDM proteins and clinical success of mRNA vaccines, herein we propose the concept of viral protease-initiated pyroptosis (VIP) mRNA therapy as a universal antiviral strategy. Using Hepatitis A virus (HAV) as a model, we rationally engineered an HAV-specific VIP activator (VIPA) by replacing the native gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage motif with that of HAV 3C protease. Expression of this VIPA selectively triggered pyroptosis in HAV-infected cells, thereby terminating viral replication. Remarkably, in vivo delivery of VIPA mRNA via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) significantly suppressed viral replication and shedding, alleviated liver injury, and elicited a pyroptosis-driven antiviral immune response in uninfected cells. Similarly, VIPA against Zika virus (ZIKV) also exhibited potent antiviral efficacy in both cell culture and mouse models. Furthermore, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) platform was deployed to design de novo cleavage motifs for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease NSP5, together with experimental screening, yielding optimized VIPAs with enhanced antiviral potency. Our work establishes the concept of VIPA mRNA therapy as a versatile platform for the treatment of diverse viral infections via \" kill-and-alert\" mechanism.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

G.; Howard, J. A.; Mast, J. F.; Kattamuri, C.; Goebel, E. J.; Thompson, T. B.", "abstract": "Members of the TGF-b family regulate diverse biological processes, and their activity is tightly controlled by extracellular antagonists such as follistatin 288 (Fst288). Fst288 potently inhibits activins A and B, GDF8, and GDF11. Among these, ActB is the least structurally and functionally characterized, which limits a full understanding of Fst288 broad activity and its specificity for this TGF-b subgroup. To address this, we solved the crystal structure of the ActB:Fst288 complex. As in other complexes, two Fst288 molecules surround ActB, occluding both receptor-binding sites. However, ActB engages Fst288 differently: its fingers bind most strongly the ND domain, while its acidic fingertips uniquely contact FSD3 disrupting interactions between the two Fst288 molecules and reducing the cooperativity seen in other complexes. Computational analysis revealed that, although ActB exhibits higher interaction enthalpy, entropic penalty lowers its overall affinity compared to ActA, consistent with experimentally measured Kd values. We therefore propose that broad ligand inhibition by Fst288 arises from variations in binding interactions and the utilization of cooperativity when direct contacts are insufficient for high affinity. In cellular contexts, antagonistic effectiveness is further impacted by interactions between complexes and the extracellular matrix, resulting in comparable in vitro IC50 values. Finally, sequence comparisons with non-binding TGF-b indicate that Fst288 specificity originates from ionic contacts with acidic ligand fingertips which likely initiate recognition, while interactions at the type I and II interfaces stabilize the complex. This study provides deeper insight into Fst288 regulation of activin signaling and paves the way for designing inhibitors with desired selectivity.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

A non-invasive, easy to use targeted prophylaxis in such cases of acute elevated CDI risk, especially in those with a history of recurrent CDI, would prevent much suffering. In this study, we envisioned a simple prophylactic intervention for CDI enabled by the oral administration of yeast-secreted dried food-formulated C. difficile toxin A (TcdA)-and B (TcdB)-neutralizing VHH-based antibodies. We engineered two antibody versions: a previously reported tetravalent VHH (VHH4) comprising dual specificities for TcdA and TcdB, and its murine IgA Fc fusion counterpart (VHH4-mIgA Fc). We explored Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) Komagataella phaffii yeast as a low-cost, highly scalable production platform. In a first experiment, we produced the antibodies at small scale in shake flask yeast cultivations and formulated the secreted antibody-containing growth medium into standard-composition dried mouse feed pellets. The antibody food pellet-administration intervention was tested in a C. difficile spore challenged mouse model in which CDI leads to 50% mortality of untreated animals. We started the antibody-feed prophylaxis dosed at 10 nmol/g pellet one day prior to C. difficile challenge and continued until the infection was cleared with ad libitum feeding. We found that the VHH4 feed almost completely prevented mortality and reduced disease-related weight loss. Despite its higher in vitro potency against TcdA and equipotent potency against TcdB, the VHH4-mIgA Fc fusion did not confer additional in vivo benefit, and further work focused on the simpler VHH4 format. Scalable high-cell-density bioreactor production of VHH4 yielded equally effective prophylactic formulations at the same dose of 10 nmol/g pellet, achieving complete survival and reduced disease burden. Our findings suggest that, with further antibody- and process development, oral prophylaxis with scalable, cost-effective, yeast-produced, dried food-formulated anti-toxin VHHs could offer a simple non-invasive, non-antibiotic prophylaxis option for the high-risk (r)CDI patient population.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its ligands (primarily 1,25(OH)2D3) have a recognized role in calcium homeostasis; however, their broader impact on female reproduction remains underexplored. We demonstrate that the VDR and its ligands are involved in the hormonal induction of uterine decidualization. Mice fed a vitamin D-deficient diet displayed an impaired hormonally induced decidual response. In a human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized human endometrial stromal cell line (T-HESC), VDR decreased during in vitro decidualization. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of VDR in T-HESC enhanced in vitro decidualization, while overexpression of VDR inhibited it. Chromatin accessibility and histone modification analyses revealed that VDR functions as a chromatin regulator, restricting accessibility and repressing transcription in specific genomic regions. Transcriptomic analyses confirmed that VDR broadly modulates gene expression, with most ligand-mediated effects occurring through the VDR. These findings identify VDR as a key regulator of transcriptional and chromatin landscapes in human endometrial stromal cells, offering novel insights into vitamin D signaling in reproduction. This study highlights the potential of targeting vitamin D pathways to treat uterine disorders associated with impaired decidualization and reduced fertility.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Over time, barrier islands may become eroded and experience land loss, which can require management actions to restore island integrity. Barrier island restoration can create or modify habitats, which can impact the organisms depending on them. Our objective was to understand how the abundance and behaviors of a suite of shorebird species responded to restoration and habitat factors at two restored sites in coastal Louisiana (USA). For five focal species, we used abundance from the breeding and non-breeding seasons as well as breeding, foraging, and maintenance behaviors as response variables in boosted regression tree models to determine the importance of various geospatial and remotely sensed predictor variables related to restoration. Across sites and species, remotely sensed variables, particularly a brightness index, tended to be more important than restoration phases as predictors of bird abundance and behavior. Our results suggest that sediment composition, moisture, and vegetative cover are related to shorebird coastal habitat selection, although the direction and strength of relationships differ among these variables and our focal species. Tying these remote sensing metrics to restoration design and management actions can help land managers better understand factors that attract and benefit birds. Additional research can advance understanding in how remote sensing can be used to monitor the availability of functional habitats for shorebirds.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Seasonal color molts, from summer-brown to winter-white, evolved in at least 21 mammals and birds to maintain camouflage in environments with seasonal snow, but the occurrence of winter-brown morphs reflects seemingly convergent local adaptation to distinct snow conditions. In the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), alternative winter morphs map to the pigmentation gene MC1R, but the evolutionary history and functional basis of this variation remain unknown. Using in vitro cellular assays, we show that winter-brown coats are caused by a derived protein-coding amino acid substitution that reduces MC1R affinity to its ligands, ASIP and -MSH. Using targeted enrichment and sequencing, we find that this mutation arose de novo within the species, around one million years ago, and was maintained across the geographically structured populations generated during its evolution in Europe. Using simulations, we show that genetic drift cannot explain the long-term maintenance of this variant, which is likely driven by spatially varying selection acting on the phenotypic polymorphism, anchoring local adaptive responses. Our results underscore how long-standing adaptive variation can fuel recurrent adaptation to heterogeneous environments through time.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Here we provide evidence that the essential stem cell transcription factor SALL4 modulates gene expression according to DNA base composition by reading the frequency of its AT-rich target motifs. Using an acute depletion strategy, we establish that SALL4-repressed genes localise to AT-rich genomic domains with high levels of dispersed SALL4 occupancy. While SALL4 is localised within peaks and distributed broadly across the genome, explainable machine learning revealed that its occupancy across the gene body is a strong predictor of transcriptional output. We observed rapid increases in chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation independent of transcriptional activity, suggesting that SALL4 primarily acts upon chromatin, while transcriptional changes are secondary. Accordingly, preventing SALL4 from recruiting the histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodelling corepressor NuRD mimicked a Sall4-null phenotype in stem cells and animal models.

MeCP2 recognizes tri-methylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) through an aromatic cage within its methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD), and this interaction contributes to the regulation of MeCP2 target genes. However, whether MeCP2 can bind methylated non-histone proteins remains unknown. In this study, we sought to identify novel, aromatic cage-dependent non-histone interacting partners of MeCP2 using an unnatural amino acid-based photocrosslinking chemoproteomic strategy. We engineered the aromatic cage of MeCP2-MBD by incorporating the photocrosslinkable amino acid 4-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF). The AzF-incorporated MeCP2-MBD variants efficiently crosslinked with histone H3 and with methylated histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. MeCP2-MBD-F142AzF was subsequently used to crosslink proteins from HEK293T cell lysates, and the enriched complexes were analyzed by mass spectrometry. This approach identified numerous previously unrecognized interacting partners of MeCP2, many of which are involved in key cellular processes including chromatin regulation, RNA processing, translation, and metabolism.

Existing solutions are limited to specific scenarios, require considerable computational resources, or are otherwise unscalable. Consequently, many large, disease-relevant protein complexes in the human proteome, as well as nearly all viruses and numerous other classes, are impractical to model with high fidelity for drug development. To modulate these protein complexes and viruses, structural information is eminently valuable, and often essential. In the last two years, machine learning based-tools that can generate binders to a given target structure with high hit rates have emerged. Combined with high-throughput screening, these technologies can far outpace traditional drug discovery. However, they cannot function well without accurate models of their target structures. Thus, to unlock the full power of AI-driven drug discovery, a scalable method must be developed to predict large protein complex structures. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Cosmohedra, a physics-based method to rapidly and accurately predict the structure of arbitrarily large, symmetric protein complexes. Validated across 4 major symmetry classes (icosahedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, and cyclic), the method consistently achieves near-experimental levels of accuracy, i.e., RMSD < 5 [A]. In test cases, the method runs in <5 minutes on consumer hardware, 10^3-10^5 times faster than the closest comparable software. The largest structure currently built, at ~40,000 amino acids, is >4 times the limits of existing machine learning and molecular dynamics-based methods.

Access of Mtb to host-derived lipids required the ESX-1 secretion system and was inversely correlated with host triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. Inhibition of TAG formation in human macrophages partially restored Mtb ILI formation, revealing a metabolic gate that governs lipid flow between host lipid droplets and intracellular Mtb.

In this study, we identified that all genes that comprise the canonical Hippo signaling pathway [hippo (hpo), salvador (sav), mats, warts (wts), yorkie (yki) and scalloped (sd)] are involved in cuticle pigmentation in the fly notum based on tissue-specific gene knock-down/out experiments and epistatic analysis. Despite the notable divergence of pigmentation mechanisms between invertebrates and vertebrates, these phenotypes can often be rescued by the human orthologs of corresponding fly genes. While we find that manipulation of Hippo signaling in dopaminergic neurons does not affect global dopamine levels in the fly brain, developmental inhibition of this pathway can increase dopamine levels in the fly head, indicating that the mechanism by which dopamine levels are regulated in the nervous system is distinct from that in epithelial cells. Through single nuclei RNA sequencing of the developing fly nota and subsequent functional studies of differentially expressed genes that are altered upon inhibition of Hippo signaling, we found four genes [ciboulot (cib), transaldolase (taldo), yellow (y) and Insulin-like receptor (InR)] that contribute to cuticle pigmentation downstream of wts. Finally, we provide multiple pieces of evidence that indicate that the function of Hippo signaling in cuticle pigmentation and tissue growth can be genetically uncoupled and also identify beaten path Vc (beat-Vc) as a novel tissue growth regulator that acts downstream of wts but is not required for cuticle pigmentation. We conclude that regulation of cuticle pigmentation by canonical Hippo signaling acts through multiple downstream genes rather than directly through TH and Ddc. We also propose that the Drosophila melanogaster cuticle may serve as a useful platform to identify previously uncharacterized mediators of Hippo signaling as well as an in vivo experimental system to test the functionality of rare genetic variants found in human Hippo signaling orthologs associated with a variety of diseases.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

T.; Hillman, S. L.; Sanchez Corrales, Y.

We focus on the placenta, a challenging tissue to transcriptomically interrogate due to senescence, intermittent hypoxia, high levels of RNase activity and tissue trauma at delivery. We performed single cell and nuclei transcriptomics on two samples with probe-based and native molecule transcript capture, droplet based and in situ plate based cell isolation. We explored sample and storage variations, including freshly dissociated tissues, fixed cells, snap frozen and FFPE processing. We find that variations in sample processing and storage have much larger effect on cell type proportions than differences in chemistry, impacting the biology that can be learned or the identification of disease markers. Further, the transcriptomic output of in situ combinatorial indexing consistently overlaps, with single nucleus transcriptomics, sharing little with other modalities. This may limit combinatorial indexing for sampling cytoplasmstic mRNAs. Our comprehensive analysis of the varying effect of single cell transcriptomic modalities, including their sample management strategies, provides novel and essential considerations for the experimental design and analysis of single cell transcriptomics applicable to challenging tissues, offering actionable guidance for future experiments.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

However, accurate signal recovery remains challenging due to pervasive background variants, sequencing artifacts, technical noise, and platform-specific biases that obscure true mutagenic patterns, hampering biomarker discovery and mechanistic interpretation. Here we introduce SigRescueR, a rigorous, pan-system, computational framework designed for noise correction and mutational signature identification. SigRescueR applies statistically robust baseline correction to effectively disentangle true mutational signals from confounding noise and artifacts. When applied to extensive datasets spanning experimental models and human cancers, SigRescueR reliably identified canonical mutational signatures associated with environmental mutagens such as colibactin, benzo[a]pyrene, and UV radiation, and chemotherapeutic agents, namely 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. SigRescueR effectively operated across diverse mutation classes, including single base substitutions, insertions and deletions, and doublet base substitutions, while also integrating strand bias and duplex sequencing data for toxicology applications. SigRescueR offers a unified, high-precision platform that seamlessly integrates cancer genomics, molecular toxicology, and mechanistic studies. It enables precise mapping of mutagenic processes and identification of robust genomic biomarkers of environmental and therapeutic exposures, providing a transformative framework for translational cancer research.

V.", "abstract": "Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) in plant mitochondria is frequent, yet acquired genes are rarely functional due to expression barriers. The holoparasitic plant Lophophytum mirabile (Balanophoraceae) is an exceptional case, having functionally replaced numerous native mitochondrial genes with host-derived xenologs. This system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of functional HGT assimilation. Here, we assembled mitochondrial genomes of the sister species L. pyramidale and their mimosoid hosts and analyzed expression data from both holoparasites. We show that this extensive functional integration occurred without the co-transfer of nuclear regulatory factors; Lophophytum relies entirely on its pre-existing, native machinery. Our results demonstrate that the primary mechanism enabling Lophophytum to overcome the transcription barrier is structural: most functional xenologs are chimeric and retain native 5' regions that likely place foreign coding sequences under the control of a recognizable native promoter. This structural solution is complemented by post-transcriptional flexibility, as the RNA editing machinery efficiently processes novel host-specific sites. However, functional replacement appears biased towards genes with inherently low editing requirements and no introns, highlighting a strong selective filter. Taken together, our results show that functional integration is driven by a combination of structural integration and the flexibility of the native regulatory system.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

Despite its significance, the mechanistic details of the PAF15-PCNA interaction remain insufficiently understood. Here, we reveal how PAF15 influences the sliding dynamics and function of PCNA. Using single-molecule diffusion analysis on a DNA skybridge platform, we show that PAF15 binding stabilizes PCNA in its DNA-bound state, reduces its diffusion rate along the duplex, restricts accessibility to PCNA PIP-box binding sites, and regulates PCNA loading and unloading on DNA via replication factor C (RFC). Our results are consistent with its coordinating role in both high-fidelity replication and lesion bypass. These findings establish PAF15 as a key regulator of PCNA function, serving as a mobile platform for DNA-editing enzymes and thereby influencing genome maintenance.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

These developments emphasize the need for computational approaches capable of describing biologically relevant conformational changes over extended timescales. G[o]Martini 3 is a coarse-grained approach that demonstrates computational efficiency and versatility across several systems, from protein-binding membranes and soluble proteins to intrinsically disordered proteins, while preserving key physicochemical features. In this work, we introduce an optimized approach that integrates dynamic contact information from AA-MD simulations to refine the contact map in G[o]Martini simulations. Specifically, we define high-frequency contacts (HFC), which reduce the number of original G[o] contacts set by ~20-30%, thereby improving the representation of conformational states beyond the original approach. Benchmarking different contact-selection criteria revealed that including intra- and interchain HFC captures structural flexibility and domain dynamics. The method was tested on three small soluble proteins and on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Overall, the optimized contact map improves sampling efficiency and expands the accessible conformational landscape relative to the original G[o]Martini 3 implementation.

Various biomarkers reflect alcohol intake over different timeframes. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) are commonly used for short-term detection, particularly in forensic contexts such as driving under the influence of alcohol (DUIA) cases. Moreover, the rapid kinetics of BAC and BrAC limit their utility in determining the precise timing of intake - an essential factor in legal cases involving defenses like the 'hipflask' argument. To address this, secondary metabolites including ethyl glucuronide (EtG), ethyl sulphate (EtS), and urine alcohol concentration (UAC) offer slower, more time-sensitive profiles. Combining these markers could enable a more accurate reconstruction of past alcohol consumption events. Traditionally, mathematical models have been used to help extract information from the dynamics of alcohol-related markers. Existing mathematical models typically focus on primary markers or single secondary markers in isolation. In this study, we present an extended mathematical model that integrates all markers; BAC, EtG, EtS, and UAC into a unified framework, expanding our previous physiological twin model. Our updated model enables personalized simulations of alcohol metabolism and intake timing, which in turn creates the fundament for enhancing forensic assessments and supporting applications where accurate temporal analysis of alcohol consumption is critical.

Selecting suitable phages requires either one-to-one experimental assays or strain-level predictions of phage-host interactions. Existing computational approaches either predict host taxonomy at broad ranks unsuitable for strain-level targeting, or require species-specific mechanistic knowledge limiting generalizability. Here, we present a phylogeny-agnostic machine learning framework predicting strain-level phage-host interactions across diverse bacterial genera from genome sequences alone. Systematically optimizing the workflow over 13.2 million training runs across five datasets (128,357 interactions, 1,058 strains, 560 phages), we achieved performance matching species-specific methods (AUROC 0.67-0.94) while eliminating phylogenetic constraints. Comprehensive feature engineering identifies biologically interpretable genetic determinants while minimizing overfitting in sparse, imbalanced datasets. Experimental validation through 1,328 novel interactions confirmed generalizability (AUROC 0.84), while genome-wide RB-TnSeq screens verified that 68.8% of experimentally identified infection mediators were captured computationally, including receptors and cell wall biosynthesis pathways. Model-guided cocktail design achieved 80.7-97.0% strain coverage with five phages, and up to a 6.2-fold improvement in one-shot phage selection over promiscuity-based selection.

T.", "abstract": "Nitrogen is an essential nutrient limiting forest productivity. Plants cannot access atmospheric N2 directly and rely on diazotrophic bacteria to fix nitrogen into bioavailable forms such as ammonium. Within forests, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) occurs primarily in soils and root nodules. However it is unclear whether the extensive microbial communities recently discovered in tree bark can also fix nitrogen. Here we combine field measurements, metagenomic profiling, and biogeochemical assays to show that bark-dwelling diazotroph communities are abundant and active across diverse tree species. Bark from eight Australian tree species showed exceptionally high C:N ratios and depleted nitrogen stable isotope signatures ({delta}15N) consistent with locally fixed nitrogen, suggesting strong selection for diazotrophs. Consistently, bark microbial communities harbour phylogenetically and physiologically diverse diazotrophs, averaging ~1012 cells m-2 and in higher relative abundance than underlying soils. Canonical and alternative nitrogenases were detected across eight bacterial phyla, primarily bark-adapted Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteriota, and Verrucomicrobiota, with strong signatures of purifying selection. Stable isotope labelling experiments demonstrated that bark-dwelling diazotrophs fix nitrogen at rates varying with tree species and habitat. In line with the presence of methane-oxidising diazotrophs, BNF was strongly stimulated by methane addition and suppressed by methanotroph inhibitors. Initial upscaling suggests bark-associated nitrogen fixation contributes up to 3.8 Tg N yr-1 globally (~6% of natural terrestrial BNF), with further studies required to constrain this budget and its contribution to tree nitrogen demands. Altogether, this discovery of substantial above-ground nitrogen inputs revises our understanding of forest nutrient cycles and redefines the functional scope of the caulosphere.", "date": "2025-11-15", "journal": ""}

We applied bryophyte-specific primers targeting p6 loop in plastid DNA and compared their performance with bryophyte bycatch from vascular plant-specific primers. Using data from bryophyte-specific primers, we analyzed richness patterns across environmental gradients and assessed their potential for environmental reconstruction. The primers resolved nearly 60% of taxa to species level and over 80% to genus level, recovering 2.63 times more taxa with 1.48 times higher species-level resolution than vascular plant-specific primers. Taxonomic richness increased nonlinearly over time and along precipitation gradients, while exhibiting unimodal relationship with temperature and glacial activity. High-resolution data also enabled trait assignments for most bryophyte taxa, allowing temporal analyses of community development and functional dynamics.
