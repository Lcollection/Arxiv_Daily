Here, we report that mice lacking the bile acid regulators, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), recapitulate the sex difference in liver cancer risk. Since few therapeutic options are available, we focused on understanding the intrinsic protection afforded to female livers. Transcriptomic analysis in control and FXR and SHP double knockout livers identified female-specific changes in metabolism, including amino acids, lipids, and steroids. We examined if the obtained transcriptomic signatures correlate with the survival outcomes for HCC patients to assess the translational potential of this murine HCC model. Gene signatures that are unique to the knockout females correspond with low-grade tumors and better survival. Ovariectomy blunts the metabolic changes in female livers and promotes tumorigenesis that, intriguingly, coincides with increases in serum bile acid (BA) levels. Despite similar genetics, we found higher serum BA concentrations in males, whereas female knockout mice excreted more BAs. Decreasing enterohepatic BA recirculation using cholestyramine, an FDA-approved resin, dramatically reduced the liver cancer burden in male mice. Overall, we reveal that sex-specific BA metabolism leading to lower circulating BA concentration protects female livers from developing cancer. Thus, targeting BA excretion may be a promising therapeutic strategy against HCC.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

To discover alternative paradigms and metrics, we systematically explore brain stimulation and resting-state activity in a whole-brain model. We find that perturbational complexity only occurs when the brain model operates within a specific dynamical regime, in which spontaneous activity produces a large degree of functional network reorganizations referred to as being fluid. The regime of high brain fluidity is characterized by a small battery of metrics drawn from dynamical systems theory and predicts the impact of consciousness-altering drugs (Xenon, Propofol, and Ketamine). We validate the predictions in a cohort of 15 subjects at various stages of consciousness and demonstrate their agreement with previously reported perturbational complexity, but in a more accessible paradigm. Beyond the facilitation in clinical use, the metrics highlight complexity properties of brain dynamics in support of the emergence of consciousness.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Myeloid cells are abundant in IPF lung and in murine lung fibrosis, but their functional effects are incompletely understood. Using mouse and human lung models, we show that ornithine produced by myeloid cells expressing Arg1 serves as a substrate for proline and collagen synthesis by lung fibroblasts. The predominant Arg1-expressing myeloid cells in mouse lung were macrophages, but in IPF lung, high-dimensional imaging revealed ARG1 to be expressed mainly in neutrophils. Arg1 inhibition suppressed both ornithine levels and collagen expression in cultured, precision-cut IPF lung slices and in murine lung fibrosis. These results were confirmed in macrophage-specific Arg1 KO mice. Furthermore, we find that this pathway is regulated by cell-to-cell crosstalk, starting with purinergic signaling: Fibroblast eATP receptor P2rx4 was necessary for fibroblast IL-6 expression, which in turn was necessary for Arg1 expression by myeloid cells.

While endothelialisation of biohybrid implants has been shown to improve device hemocompatibility, its feasibility under the influence of patients' inflammatory status remains largely unexplored. To investigate this, we developed a controlled in vitro model which allows to study endothelial dysfunction under inflammatory stress. Endothelial cells were cultured on polydimethylsiloxane under physiological shear stress and exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), simulating inflammatory conditions. Endothelial morphology and confluence was assessed using immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. Leukocyte adhesion was evaluated directly as well as indirectly, using flow cytometry to analyse cell adhesion molecules. Quantitative PCR was used for gene expression analysis of inflammatory mediators. Notably, neither LPS nor PBMCs alone induced endothelial disruption, whereas their combination significantly impaired endothelial confluence: Inflammatory activation led to substantial loss of endothelial confluence, increased leukocyte adhesion, and elevated expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. Gene expression analysis highlights the upregulation of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MCP-1. This study underscores the challenges of implementing endothelialisation in biohybrid devices, particularly in patients with systemic inflammation.

RIG-I and RNF135, a ubiquitin ligase regulator, are missing in domestic chickens but conserved in mallard ducks. The chickens' RIG-I loss was long believed to be linked to increased avian influenza susceptibility. We reinstated both genes in chickens and examined their susceptibility to infection with an H7N1 avian influenza virus. Uninfected RIG-I-expressing chickens exhibited shifts in T and B cells. At the same time, the H7N1 infection led to severe disease, persistent weight loss, and increased viral replication compared to wild-type chickens. The simultaneous expression of RIG-I and RNF135 potentiated the RIG-I activity and was associated with exacerbated inflammatory response and increased mortality without influencing virus replication. Additional animal infection experiments with two other avian influenza viruses validated these findings. They confirmed that the harmful effects triggered by RIG-I or RIG-I-RNF135-expression require a minimum degree of viral virulence. Our data indicate that the loss of RIG-I in chickens has likely evolved to counteract deleterious inflammation caused by viral infection and highlight an outcome of restoring evolutionary lost genes in birds.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Since genetic diversity represents adaptive potential, such losses of diversity are thought to limit the opportunity for viral populations to undergo antigenic change and other adaptive processes. Thus, a detailed picture of evolutionary dynamics during transmission is critical to understanding the forces driving viral evolution at an epidemiologic scale. To advance this understanding, we used a barcoded virus library and a guinea pig model of transmission to decipher where in the transmission process influenza A virus populations lose diversity. In inoculated guinea pigs, we show that a high level of viral barcode diversity is maintained. Within-host continuity in the barcodes detected across time furthermore indicates that stochastic effects are not pronounced within the inoculated hosts. Importantly, in both aerosol-exposed and direct contact animals, we observed many barcodes at the earliest time point(s) positive for infectious virus, indicating robust transfer of diversity through the environment. This high viral diversity is short-lived, however, with a sharp decline seen 1-2 days after initiation of infection. Although major losses of diversity at transmission are well described for influenza A virus, our data indicate that events that occur following viral transfer and during the earliest stages of natural infection have a central role in this process. This finding suggests that host factors, such as immune effectors, may have greater opportunity to impose selection during influenza A virus transmission than previously recognized.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Using long-read sequencing, we sequenced and assembled the centromeres from eight families that include a child with free T21 (1 trio, 6 child-mother duos, and 1 singleton) all resulting from maternal meiosis I errors. Two of these families carry the smallest chr21 centromeres (143 and 181 kbp) observed in female individuals to date, exhibiting a ~10.7- and ~19.4-fold centromeric -satellite higher-order repeat array size difference between the maternally inherited homologs, respectively. In both cases, the longer centromere harbors a poorly defined centromere dip region, marked by DNA hypomethylation, in the proband but not in the mother. A comparison of all proband chr21 centromeres (n=24) to those of controls (n=261) shows that small centromeres are not enriched in families with T21 (p-value=0.73); contrarily, chr21 extreme centromere size asymmetry (>10-fold) is unique of T21 (p-value=0.003), suggesting that this feature may represent a genetic risk factor for a subset of families with free T21.

However, the fidelity of hPSC-derived cell types remains a major concern, particularly when these cells are intended to replicate complex or region-specific subtypes, such as those required to explore and treat neurological diseases. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the principal projection neurons of the striatum, are one such target cell type relevant to disorders such as Huntington's disease. While protocols for generating hPSC-derived MSNs (hPSC-MSNs) exist, the extent to which these cells faithfully recapitulate their genuine counterparts is unclear. Here, we generated isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from striatal (LGE) and non-neural (fibroblast) fetal tissues, and differentiated them into MSN-like cells alongside a naive human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line. Using DNA methylation profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing, we systematically compared the epigenetic and transcriptional features of these hPSC-MSNs to authentic fetal MSNs. Our findings reveal persistent epigenetic signatures inherited from the tissue of origin, which influence differentiation outcomes. While LGE-derived hiPSCs retained elements of a striatal-biased methylome and yielded MSN-like cells with enhanced similarity to authentic MSNs, all hPSC-MSNs remained epigenetically and transcriptionally distinct from genuine MSNs and we identified clusters of hPSC-derived cells with aberrant or incomplete phenotypes. These results demonstrate that even isogenic hiPSC lines exhibit variable differentiation potential due to residual epigenetic memory and protocol compatibility. We highlight the need for refined protocols and rigorous benchmarking of hPSC-derived models, particularly for regionally specified neuronal subtypes.

It is debated whether this synchronization and the resulting beat percept reflect phase alignment of endogenous neural oscillations to the external regularity (entrainment), or evoked responses to the rhythmic stimulus (tracking). Here, we use the tempo-dependent properties of beat processing to differentiate between the two accounts. Participants listened to a repeating rhythmic pattern at different speeds. Behaviorally, they consistently tapped at the preferred beat rate (around 2 Hz) across tempi, shifting to higher metrical levels as tempo increased. We found a similar shift in EEG data, where the metrical level at which neural synchronization was strongest depended on tempo. This selective enhancement is consistent with entrainment accounts and could indeed be mimicked by an oscillator model. However, importantly, the results were also captured by a model simulating evoked responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that while neural responses to rhythm are selectively enhanced at the beat rate, this enhancement need not be taken as evidence for entrainment, but can also be explained by successive evoked responses.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Points of convergence vary between the cell types of the brain and are greatest in mature glutamatergic neurons, where they broadly target not just synaptic and epigenetic, but unexpectedly, mitochondrial biology. The strongest convergent networks occur between NDD genes with common co-expression patterns in the post-mortem brain, biological annotations, and clinical associations, suggesting that convergence may one-day inform patient stratification and treatment.

This raises a crucial question: how does the brain integrate information between these seemingly opposed systems? Here, using precision neuroimaging methods, we show that these internal/external networks are not as dissociated as traditionally thought. Using densely-sampled 7T fMRI data, we defined individualized whole-brain networks from participants at rest and calculated the retinotopic preferences of individual voxels within these networks during an visual mapping task. We show that while the overall network activity between the DN and dATN is independent at rest, considering a latent retinotopic code reveals a complex, voxel-scale interaction stratified by visual responsiveness. Specifically, the interaction between the DN and dATN at rest is structured at the voxel-level by each voxel's retinotopic preferences, such that the spontaneous activity of voxels preferring similar visual field locations is more anti-correlated than that of voxels preferring different visual field locations. Further, this retinotopic scaffold integrates with the domain-specific preferences of subregions within these networks, enabling efficient, parallel processing of retinotopic and domain-specific information. Thus, DN and dATN are not independent at rest: voxel-scale interaction between these networks preserves and encodes information in both positive and negative BOLD responses, even in the absence of visual input or task demands.

Fe-male retired breeder Wistar rats underwent bilateral ovariectomy and received monthly low-dose Scl-Ab injections (2 mg/kg/month) from 3 to 14 weeks post-OVX, while a control group remained untreated. We report that early intermittent low-dose Scl-Ab treatment increased bone formation (calcein labelling) and reduced bone resorption, as evidenced by a decrease in TRAP+ osteoclasts and reduced expression of catabolic genes (Sost, Ctsk, Mmp9) compared to untreated rats. Treatment also decreased the percentage of empty lacunae and the number of MMP14+ osteocytes, indicating improved osteocyte survival and reduced perilacunar remodel-ling.

Our aim was to determine whether (1) ROA species richness patterns scale as a function of key geo-environmental factors including island area, geological age, environmental heterogeneity (elevation and topographic complexity) and inter-island isolation, and (2) whether the magnitude of the effects of these factors varies across archipelagos and taxa.

Two subtypes of ISCs exist, and both a- and b-ISCs regulate pH- and ion-homeostasis in epithelia. Gain and loss of FOXI1 function are associated with human diseases, including Pendred syndrome, male infertility, renal acidosis and cancers. Foxi1 was predominantly studied in the context of ISC specification, however, reports indicate additional functions in early and ectodermal development. Here, we re-investigated the functions of Foxi1 in Xenopus laevis embryonic mucociliary epidermis development and found a novel function for Foxi1 in the generation of Notch-ligand expressing mucociliary multipotent progenitors (MPPs). We demonstrate that Foxi1 has multiple concentration-dependent functions: At low levels, Foxi1 maintains ectodermal competence in MPPs through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, while at high levels, Foxi1 induces a multi-step process of ISC specification and differentiation in cooperation with Ubp1 and Dmrt2. We further describe how foxi1 expression is affected through auto- and Notch-regulation, and how this developmental program affects mucociliary patterning. Together, we reveal novel functions for Foxi1 in Xenopus mucociliary epidermis formation, relevant to our understanding of vertebrate development and human disease.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Coral larvae offer significant potential for reef recovery, as a single coral colony can release millions of offspring, with almost all larvae dying before finding a suitable habitat. Building upon an iterative design process, incorporating a gradient of sizes and angles based on larval settlement preferences observed in nature, we developed and tested seven 3D-printed settlement module designs, proposed to enhance coral larvae habitat. We studied the settlement and survival of coral larvae on the settlement modules integrating these designs and adjacent reef structures in K[a]neohe Bay over one year. Helix recesses dramatically outperformed other structural features, increasing settlement by ~80-fold and post-settlement survival over a year by 20-50-fold compared to control modules. In contrast to natural reef substrates, settlement on modules with helix recesses increased by ~70-fold. We identified the recess dimensions and light levels preferred as settlement habitat. In a parallel tank experiment, we explored the impacts of hydrodynamics on the settlement and survival of Montipora capitata larvae on modules with helix recesses. We found that settlement was more pronounced under high-flow conditions, suggesting a crucial role of micro-scale hydrodynamics in entraining settling corals. These findings highlight the potential of helix recesses to significantly improve early coral recruitment, a critical bottleneck in reef restoration. By integrating these structures into artificial reefs and coastal infrastructure, our approach offers an innovative, scalable, and cost-effective solution to enhance reef resilience and accelerate ecosystem recovery in a changing ocean.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Computational methods have been developed to predict EPIs in silico from DNA sequences and chromatin information; however, there are major challenges with the generalizability and accuracy of predictions by existing methods across cell types and conditions unseen during model training. We developed and validated UniversalEPI, an attention-based deep ensemble model that predicts EPIs up to 2 Mb apart using only DNA sequence and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) data. Unlike models that reconstruct full Hi-C contact maps, UniversalEPI focuses on biologically relevant, sparse chromatin interactions between accessible regulatory elements. It generalizes across both bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq-derived pseudo-bulk datasets, delivering state-of-the-art performance while using fewer input modalities than existing approaches. By modeling predictive uncertainty, UniversalEPI enables statistically robust differential analysis of chromatin interactions across conditions. We demonstrate its utility by tracking dynamic EPIs during human macrophage activation and identifying regulatory differences between cancer cell states in esophageal adenocarcinoma.

During learning, multimodal information converges onto the hippocampus, activating sparse neuronal assemblies which are thought to form a memory representation through concerted activity and synaptic interconnectivity. In this work, we use a novel tool for fast fluorescent labeling of engram neurons (FLEN). FLEN is based on c-Fos activity-dependent transient expression of a destabilized fluorescent marker ZsGreen1 rapidly after one-trial learning. With FLEN, we explore the electrophysiological properties of c-Fos activated CA3 pyramidal neurons a few hours following one-trial learning of an episodic-like memory. In parallel, we employ the Robust Activity Marker (RAM) system, which provides activity-dependent labelling 24 hours following a novel experience. Comparing FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons allows to characterize how the properties of neuronal assemblies evolve during an initial phase of consolidation. Whereas no difference was observed in the excitability of FLEN+ vs. FLEN- neurons, RAM+ neurons were more excitable than RAM- neurons. This suggests that CA3 pyramidal neurons recruited in an engram progressively acquire increased excitability as compared to neurons which were not activated by the one-trial contextual memory task. On the other hand, like RAM+ neurons, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs. Overall, with the FLEN strategy, we can show that both the intrinsic excitability and the synaptic properties of CA3 pyramidal neurons undergo progressive plastic changes over the first day following a one-trial memory task.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

However, movies are complex cultural artifacts that differ in content, structure, and style, raising concerns about the generalizability of ISC findings across movies. Using fMRI data from 112 subjects watching eight animated movies, we quantified between-movie variability in ISC and examined its implications for trait- or state-like effects. ISC varied substantially across movies and brain regions, with the strongest ISC observed in regions showing the greatest variability. Consequently, associations between behavior and ISC differed markedly across movies.

ATM leverages the superior quality and minimal distortion of anatomical MRI and learns from multi-subject datasets to deliver robust, subject-specific streamline bundles with accurate preservation of structural connectivity. Trained on paired T1w and tractogram data, ATM learns to synthesize anatomically plausible streamlines conditioned on subject anatomy. This paradigm-shifting approach overcomes challenges associated with complex configurations, such as crossing, kissing, bending, and bottlenecks, providing anatomically guided bundle reconstructions. Using the TractoInferno dataset with 30 white matter bundles, we compared the performance of ATM against methods based on diffusion MRI, including MRtrix, RecoBundlesX, and TractSeg. ATM consistently showed strong performance across several metrics, including bundle similarity, volume coverage, angular correlation, streamline validity, geometric fidelity, and connection topology.

H.", "abstract": "UBB+1, a ubiquitin variant protein resulting from a frameshift in the ubiquitin-B gene, is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). At the cellular level, UBB+1 disrupts the ubiquitin-proteasome system while inducing autophagy. Notably, UBB+1 itself is secreted via autophagosome-like vesicles. Here, we demonstrate that UBB+1 can be removed from the cell by degradative and secretory autophagy. SQSTM1/p62 functions as a pivotal ubiquitin receptor for UBB+1, recognizing its ubiquitin domain and facilitating loading into autophagosomes. Oligomerization of SQSTM1/p62 was critical to isolate UBB+1 in bodies preventing its aggregation. Intriguingly, both gain- and loss-of-function SQSTM1/p62 suppressed UBB+1 secretion, causing intracellular retention. SQSTM1/p62 knockout led to UBB+1 accumulation in insoluble aggregates, while its overexpression promoted the formation of p62-UBB+1 bodies. We further identified distinct roles for SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in secretory autophagy of UBB+1/Specifically, the R-SNARE SEC22B and the Q-SNAREs Syntaxin-4 (STX4) and SNAP23 participated in UBB+1 exocytosis. Disruption of SEC22B impaired the fusion of UBB+1-containing autophagosomes with the plasma membrane, reducing UBB+1secretion without affecting its intracellular turnover. Inhibition of lysosomes partially stabilized UBB+1 indicating that degradation and secretion are complementary processes that determine the fate of UBB+1. This study elucidates the dual roles of autophagy in managing neurotoxic proteins, highlighting SQSTM1/p62 as a key mediator of UBB+1 trafficking and secretion. Although ubiquitin typically acts as a degradation signal, our findings reveal a rare instance of a ubiquitin-related protein driving secretory autophagy.

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) use the ubiquitin-proteasome system to selectively degrade target proteins. Here, we developed CASPROTAC 6, a reversible and cell-permeable PROTAC degrader that directly targets SpCas9 proteins for degradation. The CASPROTAC 6 molecule was derived by linking a known SpCas9 binder BRD7087 with an S-substituted Lenalidomide cereblon (CRBN) ligand via a six-carbon alkyl linker. Our data show that CASPROTAC 6 is a broad-spectrum degrader of SpCas9 and variants such as dCas9 and Cas9 nickases. CASPROTAC 6 degrades SpCas9 and the SpCas9-guide RNA complex via the proteasome system by approximately 50%. As a result, CASPROTAC 6 effectively enhanced the precision of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing by increasing target specificity.

Region-specific ablation produced changes in both neural activity and vascular dynamics, decreased power in the delta-band of the local field potential, reduced sustained vascular responses to prolonged sensory stimulation, and abolished the post-stimulus undershoot in cerebral blood volume. Coherence between the left and right somatosensory cortex gamma-band power envelope and blood volume at ultra-low frequencies was decreased, suggesting type-1 nNOS neurons integrate long-range coordination of brain signals.

The functional boundary of a tumor (FTB) can be characterized by the size and activity of the intermediate zone: a battlefield driven by the interplay of cellular heterogeneity and environmental factors. The pioneering technology of functional imaging Skin Electrodynamic Introscopy (SEI) has a unique combination of spatial and temporal resolution on a fairly large scanning area, which allowed dynamic visualization of the spectral impedance landscape (SEL), and thus to overlap and monitor the intermediate zone in our melanoma studies. A new class of SEL phenomena was discovered for the first time: the test-induced manifestation of coherent dynamic macroscopic structuring at the tissue level, thus reflecting the collective processes of intercellular interactions in parameters of the intra- and intercellular level. It turned out that these effects are highly sensitive to short weak stimuli like ischemia, non-thermal EMF and MF. Our primary objective was to identify general indicators of the FTB manifestation within spectral electrical impedance parameters. Utilizing five datasets acquired through our innovative SEI technology, we aimed to evaluate the static and dynamic characteristics of the FTB in relation to its visible boundary, contrasting them against the surrounding tissue. This study interprets observed effects through the lens of the theory of self-organization and dissipative structures. The findings provide the first empirical evidence of dissipative structuring at the tissue level, observed across the majority of the investigated phenomena- as transition from initially chaotic SEL to the tumor specific patterns and back upon cessation of the stimulus: * Initial impedance boundaries are significantly wider than visible ones, approximately repeating their shape. The stimulation leads to activation of intermediate zone and expansion of impedance boundaries, especially noticeable at the invasive fronts. \" Relaxation of intermediate zone in the form of mobile clusters; * Emergence of antiphase structures/clusters as markers of the tumor invasive fronts, * Emergence of the tumor resistance zone to the influence as a post effect; * Significant spatial and temporal differences of FTB at the intra- and intercellular level, which is especially noticeable at the level of mitochondrial membranes; * Manifestation of stroma of pre-existing nevus at the mitochondrial fluctuation field; * Weakening or loss of the most phenomena in a case of X-rays exposure.

Therefore, identifying key regulators of active forgetting is crucial to advance our understanding of neuroplasticity. In this study, we utilised the compact and tractable Caenorhabditis elegans model to investigate the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in forgetting. We conducted butanone associative learning assays based on an established protocol and used mutant strains deficient in dopamine synthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase CAT-2 and dopamine transporter DAT-1) and signalling (G protein-coupled receptors DOP-1, DOP-2, and DOP-3) to assess the impact on learning and memory retention. Learning was measured immediately post-training, and memory retention was evaluated every 0.5 hours up to 2 hours. Our results show that animals lacking dopamine display a modest enhancement in learning relative to wild-type, with the learned association persisting for at least 2 hours after training. We also found that D2-like receptors DOP-2 and DOP-3 act together to modulate the forgetting process, with D1-like receptor DOP-1 functioning redundantly. Furthermore, re-expression of CAT-2 tyrosine hydroxylase in ADE and/or CEP neurons was unable to rescue the memory retention phenotype observed in cat-2 mutants, suggesting that dopamine release from all dopaminergic neurons is required to modulate forgetting. These findings highlight the critical role of dopamine in forgetting, consistent with findings in Drosophila, and suggest potential relevance for understanding memory retention during healthy ageing and in conditions with dopamine imbalances such as Parkinson's disease.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Once incorporated into the nuclear genome, some NUMTs can be conserved for extended periods and may potentially acquire novel cellular roles. However, current mainstream methods for detecting NUMTs are inefficient at identifying ancient and highly degraded NUMTs, leading to their prevalence and impact being underestimated. These ancient NUMTs likely play a far greater role in genetic functions than previously recognized, including contributing to the acquisition of functional exons. This study focuses on identifying ancient NUMTs in mammalian genomes using enhanced high-sensitivity sequence comparison methods. A sensitive and accurate NUMT-searching pipeline was established, predicting 1,013 NUMTs in the human reference genome, 364 (36%) of which are newly detected compared to the UCSC reference human NUMTs database. Notably, 90 pre-eutherian human NUMTs were identified, representing significantly older NUMTs than previously reported, with origins dating back at least 100 million years. The most ancient mammalian NUMTs could even date back over 160 million years, inserted into the nuclear genome of the common ancestor of therian mammals. This study provides a comprehensive exploration of the quantity and evolutionary history of mammalian NUMTs, paving the way for future research on endosymbiotic impact on the evolution of nuclear genomes.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

However, the methods to produce fine grained insights from spatially scattered information do not exist. Here, we introduce Delta-Marches, a framework for mechanistic interpretability that leverages generative models to produce high fidelity images from semantic latent representations. By identifying directions in this space corresponding to class transitions, we simulate controlled morphological changes between classes. Comparing each image to its class-shifted counterpart enables a secondary model to nominate features most affected by the shift. This approach overcomes sample to sample variability and yields idealized, interpretable transformations at subcellular resolution. We prototype the approach in the context of histopathological grading of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Delta-Marches generate synthetic grade transitions indistinguishable from real images and autonomously pinpoints nuclear enlargement and increased nucleolar count in tumor cells as key properties of higher grades features identifiable only through the method's subcellular precision. In addition to these features mirroring clinical criteria, it also reveals reduced vasculature, a pattern reported in multiple studies but absent from standard grading rubrics.

Modulation of voltage-dependent calcium and potassium channels by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) plays a key role in dampening nociceptive transmission. Baclofen and the analgesic peptide -conotoxin Vc1.1 both activate GABAB receptors (GABABR), resulting in the inhibition of CaV2.2 and CaV2.3 calcium channels to reduce colonic nociception. Recent studies have also shown that GABABR activation potentiates GIRK1/2 potassium channels in mammalian sensory afferent neurons. In this study, we investigated the expression of these ion channel targets in rodent and human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, including those innervating the colon. We also examined how CaV2.2 and GIRK channel antagonists, as well as a GIRK channel activator, affect the passive and active electrical properties of adult mouse DRG neurons. Additionally, we assessed the effects of -conotoxin Vc1.1 on neuronal excitability in the presence of the selective CaV2.2 antagonist {omega}-conotoxin CVIE and the GIRK channel activator ML297. We further evaluated the impact of the GIRK channel antagonist Tertiapin-Q on excitability in mouse colonic DRGs and colonic afferents and explored the role of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in regulating membrane excitability of colonic DRGs. Our findings demonstrate that both CaV2.2 inhibition and GIRK channel potentiation reduce excitability in mouse DRGs, likely mediating the analgesic effects of Vc1.1 and baclofen observed in vivo. However, our findings indicate that GIRK channel potentiation appears to play a limited role in modulating excitability in colon-innervating DRGs and colonic afferents. These findings suggest that neurons innervating different regions of the body employ distinct mechanisms to regulate neuronal excitability and nociceptive signaling.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate methods that satisfy these requirements and show strong potential for characterizing diverse terrestrial eDNA samples collected from flower and leaf surfaces. We used novel methods to collect and process 236 flower eDNA samples and 21 leaf surface eDNA samples, obtaining 2,228 Arthropoda eDNA detections spanning 175 families using amplicon sequencing of two genetic markers. Detected taxa were diverse and included numerous groups of conservation concern, such as bees (Hymenoptera; Anthophila, 32 genera spanning 5 families) and Lepidoptera (209 genera from 21 families). Data reveal strong associations between insect community richness and remotely sensed measures of forest habitat, providing a quantitative perspective of relevance to insect conservation. It is increasingly clear that a variety of organisms readily disperse eDNA throughout the environment, supporting the notion that eDNA will be a powerful tool for characterizing species distributions and monitoring at-risk species.

The koji-fungus Aspergillus oryzae, traditionally used in Japanese brewing and fermentation for over a thousand years, is now widely utilized in modern biotechnology as a host for enzyme production. We discovered that, over time in culture, hyphae become thicker, resulting in a tenfold increase in cell volume, and the number of nuclei in hyphal cells also increases tenfold, exceeding 200. The increase in cell volume and nuclear number is unique among the investigated Aspergillus species and correlates with its high enzyme production capabilities. Since nuclear number and cell volume are correlated, both must increase simultaneously for either to expand. Our analyses identified genetic factors and nutritional environmental signals involved in each of these increases. Increases in nuclear number and cell volume were also observed in other fungi bred for industrial use. This study not only deepens our understanding of the evolutionary processes that promote high enzyme productivity through fungal breeding, but also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating cell volume and nuclear number in multinucleate organisms.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

While PLX3397 increased synaptic density, it reduced the percentage of neurons phase-locked to gamma oscillations. This neural decoupling was closely associated with gene expression changes related to synapse organization. We investigated whether Gamma ENtrainment Using Sensory (GENUS) stimulation could counterbalance the neural circuit alterations induced by PLX3397. GENUS + PLX3397 restored gamma phase-locking, reshaped gene expression signatures, and improved learning and memory better than either treatment alone in 5xFAD mice.

Existing methods for detecting HTRs include time-consuming visual scoring, magnetometer-based approaches, and analysis of videos using semi-automated commercial software. Here, we present a new automated approach for quantifying HTRs from experimental videos using the open-source machine learning-based toolkits, DeepLabCut (DLC) and Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA). Pose estimation DLC models were trained to predict X,Y coordinates of 13 body parts of C57BL/6J mice using historical experimental videos of HTRs induced by various psychedelic drugs. Next, a non-overlapping set of historical experimental videos was analyzed and used to train SimBA random forest behavioral classifiers to predict the presence of the HTR. The DLC+SimBA approach was then validated using a separate subset of visually scored videos. DLC+SimBA model performance was assessed at different video resolutions (50%, 25%, 12.5%) and frame rates (120, 60, 30 frames per second or fps). Our results indicate that HTRs can be quantified accurately at 50% resolution and 120 fps (precision = 95.45, recall = 95.56, F1 = 95.51) or at lower frame rates and resolutions (i.e., 50% resolution and 60 fps ). The best performing DLC+SimBA model combination was deployed to evaluate the effects of bufotenine, a tryptamine derivative with uncharacterized potency and efficacy in the HTR paradigm. Interestingly, bufotenine only induced elevated HTRs (ED50 = 0.99 mg/kg, max counts = 24) when serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT1A) were pharmacologically blocked and activity at other sites of action may also impact its pharmacological effects (e.g., serotonin transporter). HTR counts for a subset of 21 videos from bufotenine experiments were strongly correlated for DLC+SimBA vs. visual scoring and semi-automated software detection methods (r = 0.98 and 0.99). Finally, the DLC+SimBA approach displayed high accuracy when compared to visual scoring of HTRs for three serotonergic psychedelic drugs with variable HTR frequencies (r = 0.99 vs. mean visual scores from 3 blinded raters). In summary, the DLC+SimBA approach represents a modular, noninvasive, and open-source method of HTR detection from experimental videos with accuracy comparable to magnetometer-based approaches and greater speed than visual scoring.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a structure that is critical for forming Pavlovian and instrumental emotional associations. Previous studies have established that Pavlovian fear conditioning increases the intrinsic excitability of BLA projection neurons. Learning-associated increases in excitability are hypothesised to facilitate the induction of synaptic plasticity and integration of neurons into functional learning circuits. Here, we examined whether instrumental learning produces similar changes in intrinsic excitability. Male and Female Long Evans rats were trained to lever press for a food reward and subsequently split into 3 behavioural groups; punished, yoked, and reward. Punished rats received response-contingent footshocks, yoked rats received response-independent footshocks, and reward rats received no shock. Intrinsic excitability was measured as the number of action potentials (APs) evoked by a series of depolarising current injections during whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Reward learning increased the intrinsic excitability of BLA projection neurons compared to naive controls. Punishment training maintained excitability and excitability was correlated with performance on the punishment task. Response-independent footshocks arrested reward-associated increases in excitability, reverting the BLA neurons to a naive state. Group differences were observed in AP half-width and the current underlying the post-burst AHP. Together, these findings show that instrumental reward learning enhances the intrinsic excitability of BLA projection neurons, potentially supporting action-outcome encoding by promoting synaptic plasticity and circuit integration. The results also suggest that different forms of learning engage distinct biophysical adaptations. A mechanistic understanding of the neurobiology underlying instrumental association learning may help inform the development of treatments for psychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in this process, such as major depressive disorder and conduct disorder.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

New treatment options for brain cancers are, therefore, desperately needed. Active research that is being conducted in immunotherapy for glioblastoma and other primary brain cancers may be hampered by the lack of detailed studies that characterize the different immune compartments of orthotopic murine brain tumor models. Methods: We used glioma neural stem cell lines derived from glioblastoma patients and murine glioma cell lines to produce intracranial xenograft and syngraft brain tumors in immunodeficient (NSG) or immunocompetent (C57BL/6) mice, respectively. High-parameter flow cytometry was used to characterize the immune cell compartment in each brain tumor model. We investigated the tissues of brain, spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow for the frequencies of monocytes, macrophages, B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and where possible, their subsets. Results: In a study first of non-tumor-bearing mice, we show dramatic differences between NSG and C57BL/6 mice in numbers not only of T and B cells but also of other immune cells. Then we show in mice bearing brain tumors significant differences in numbers of immune cells in brain, draining lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow. Also, we investigated the effects on immune cell numbers of luciferase-expressing murine glioma cell lines compared to the parental lines. Finally, we show the effects of whole-body irradiation on immune cell numbers.

However, even under carefully controlled conditions, stem cell-derived models exhibit substantial \"inter-individual\" heterogeneity. Focusing on gastruloids, a powerful model of the early posterior embryo, we sought to investigate the origins of this heterogeneity. To this end, we developed a scalable protocol for generating gastruloids that are monoclonal, i.e. derived from a single mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). Single cell transcriptional profiling of monoclonal gastruloids revealed extensive inter-individual heterogeneity, with some hardly progressing, others resembling conventional gastruloids but biased towards mesodermal or neural lineages, and yet others bearing cell types rare or absent from conventional polyclonal gastruloids. To investigate this further, we leveraged DNA Typewriter to record the cell lineage relationships among the mESCs from which monoclonal gastruloids originate. Early in the expansion of \"founder\" mESCsprior to induction of the resulting aggregates to form gastruloidswe observe clear examples of fate bias or fate restriction, i.e. sister clades that exhibit markedly different cell type compositions. In a separate experiment with DNA Typewriter, we reconstructed a monophyletic \"tree of trees\", composed of ~50,000 cells derived from ~100 gastruloids, all descended from a single \"founder of founders\" stem cell. From these data, we find that founder mESCs that are more closely related are more likely to give rise to monoclonal gastruloids with similar cell type compositions. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the intrinsic states of mESCs are heritable, and shape their descendants' fates across many cell divisions.

To shed light on this conundrum, we examined the PIWI pathway in colon cancer through combining bioinformatic analyses and cell-based assays. Shifted Weighted Annotation Network (SWAN) analysis revealed that the pathway experiences significant allelic losses in colon cancer and that PIWIL2, the main catalytic component of the pathway responsible for TE silencing, experiences the highest percent deletions. PIWIL2 is downregulated in colon tumors of advanced stage, nodal metastasis, and in certain subtypes, correlating with poor survival, while it is also downregulated in ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that predisposes to colon cancer.

Embryoid bodies (EBs) are self-organizing multicellular structures that recapitulate aspects of early mammalian embryogenesis. We set out to perform a CRISPR screen perturbing all transcription factors (TFs) in murine EBs. Specifically, a library of TF-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) was used to generate mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) bearing single TF knockouts. Aggregates of these mESCs were induced to form mouse EBs, such that each resulting EB was 'mosaic' with respect to the TF perturbations represented among its constituent cells. Upon performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on cells derived from mosaic EBs, we found many TF perturbations exhibiting large and seemingly significant effects on the likelihood that individual cells would adopt certain fates, suggesting roles for these TFs in lineage specification. However, to our surprise, these results were not reproducible across biological replicates. Upon further investigation, we discovered cellular bottlenecks during EB differentiation that dramatically reduce clonal complexity, curtailing statistical power and confounding interpretation of mosaic screens. Towards addressing this challenge, we developed a scalable protocol in which each individual EB is monoclonally derived from a single mESC and genetically barcoded. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we show how these monoclonal EBs enable us to better quantify the consequences of TF perturbations as well as 'inter-individual' heterogeneity across EBs harboring the same genetic perturbation. Looking forward, monoclonal EBs and EB-derived organoids may be powerful tools not only for genetic screens, but also for modeling Mendelian disorders, as their underlying genetic lesions are overwhelmingly constitutional (i.e. present in all somatic cells), yet give rise to phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

We captured ~30,000 nuclei across seven circadian time points, recovering all major leaf cell types. We identified over 7,400 genes with cluster-resolved circadian regulation, and used coexpression analysis to define five major temporal expression clades shared across all cell types. We leveraged these assignments to identify genes with cell type-specific temporal shifts in expression. Single cell gene regulatory networks (scGRNs) were generated for each cluster through GENIE3, identifying many shared and unique transcription factor (TF) target interactions across clusters. A close examination of CCA1 targets identified Photosystem II repair components in a subset of mesophyll cells and a large number of auxin-associated genes in only a handful of clusters despite robust expression in other clusters, suggestive of cell type-specific CCA1 target regulation.

The European flat oyster, Ostrea edulis, is no exception. In this study we performed both k-mer based and reference-based analyses on short-read data with high coverage ([~]70-160X) from five individuals. Up to one-third of heterozygous SNPs showed allelic coverage fractions that deviated from expectation. Despite no evidence of recent whole-genome duplication, we detected significant signals for genomic regions of increased ploidy, and 15% and 25% of k-mer pairs distant by a single nucleotide displayed triploid-like and tetraploid-like profiles respectively. In a diploid species, this indicates the presence of heterozygote and homozygote duplications. These results were confirmed by coverage-based genotype inference, which showed that deviant SNPs are located in polymorphic duplications. While duplications affected genic and non-genic regions similarly, their genomic distribution varied across chromosomes, with a notable enrichment in non-metacentric chromosomes. The latter being prone to somatic aneuploidy, we suggest that aneuploidy could act as an indirect driver, with duplications potentially buffering the expression of recessive deleterious mutations in aneuploid cells.

Cleavage occurs in human serum regardless of whether plasmin becomes activated by host tissue-plasminogen activator or by the activity of the S. aureus enzyme staphylokinase. Expressing a plasmin-resistant form of ClfA, and a truncated form that mimics the plasmin-cleaved product on the bacterial cell surface, revealed that following cleavage, ClfA cannot mediate aggregation of S. aureus in fibrinogen. Truncated ClfA on the cell surface cannot bind to fibrinogen and promotes the establishment of renal abscesses in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggest that activation of plasmin during infection leads to site-specific processing of ClfA, and this not only abrogates fibrinogen binding but also facilitates enhanced S. aureus persistence in the host. Thus, we demonstrate that proteolytic processing by plasmin is a mechanism for modulating the host-pathogen interaction during infection.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

While neutrophil heterogeneity is a topic of increasing research interest, few efforts have been made to model the dynamics of neutrophil population subsets. We develop a mathematical model to describe the dynamics that characterizes the states and transitions involved in the maturation of human neutrophils. We use single-cell gene expression data to identify five clusters of healthy human neutrophils, and pseudo-time analysis to inform model structure. We find that precursor neutrophils transition into immature neutrophils, which then either transition to an interferon-responsive state or continue to mature through two further states. The key model parameters are the transition rates (the inverse of a transition rate is the mean waiting time in one state before transitioning to another). In this framework, the transition from the precursor to immature state (mean time less than an hour) is more rapid than subsequent transitions (mean times more than 12 hours). Approximately a quarter of neutrophils are estimated to follow the interferon responsive path; the remainder continue along the standard maturation pathway. We use Bayesian inference to describe the variation, between individuals, in the fraction of cells within each cluster.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

The etiologic agent of HAT is a trypanosome belonging to the species Trypanosoma brucei (Tb) s.l., a unicellular parasite transmitted by tsetse flies. Tb s.l. consists of three subspecies: T. b. brucei (Tbb), T. b. gambiense (Tbg) and T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr). These subspecies are morphologically indistinguishable and classified according to host in which they are found, type of disease and geographical distribution. During the last few decades, there has been considerable effort to genetically characterize Tb s.l. isolated from domestic and wild animals in order to better evaluate the impact of animal reservoirs on the epidemiology of HAT. To assess genetic diversity of Tb s.l. strains circulating in three endemic or historical HAT foci in Cote dIvoire, we conducted a population genetics study of these parasites. Biological and isolated stock samples collected from pigs and reference stocks were tested with the primers of the Trypanosoma gambiense-specific-glycoprotein gene (TgsGP) and were genetically characterized with eighteen microsatellite primers. TgsGP positive samples did not fit into Tbg as regard to their microsatellite profile. We also found that in Ivoirian foci, Tbb populations (animal trypanosomes) were structured as several strongly isolated units that propagate clonally. This is in variance with other published data on that subspecies. This study confirms the need to develop better tools to explore the relationships between Tbb and Tbg and to study the epidemiological role of potential animal reservoir for Tbg.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

In the current study, we demonstrated that ovarian cancer cells treated with photothermolysis mediated by near-infrared-absorbing CuS nanoparticles and 15-ns laser pulses were ingested by human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) more efficiently than were ovarian cancer cells treated with ionizing radiation. Moreover, ingestion of ovarian cancer cells treated with CuS NP-mediated photothermolysis promoted MoDC activation. Immature MoDCs that had been exposed to photothermolysis-treated cancer cells caused greater clonal expansion of co-cultured human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells than did immature MoDCs that had been exposed to ionizing radiation-treated tumor cells.

Despite the promise of machine learning, traditional methods often fall short in providing both high classification accuracy and interpretable, statistically validated feature importance scores for high-dimensional imaging data. This gap is particularly evident when conventional techniques such as random forests, LIME, and SHAP are applied, as they struggle with complex feature interactions and managing noise in large datasets. We address this challenge by developing an integrated framework that combines Oblique Random Forests (ORFs) with a novel, permutation-based feature importance testing algorithm. ORFs extend traditional random forests by employing oblique decision boundaries through linear combinations of features, thereby capturing intricate interactions inherent in neuroimaging data. Our feature importance testing method, NEOFIT, rigorously quantifies the significance of each feature by generating null distributions and corrected p-values. We first validate our approach using simulated datasets, establishing its robustness and scalability under controlled conditions. We then apply our method to classify sex from both voxel-wise structural MRI and cortical thickness data in humans and macaques, facilitating direct cross-species comparisons. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only enhances classification performance but also provides clear, interpretable insights into the neuroanatomical features that distinguish sexes. These methodological advancements pave the way for improved diagnostic tools and contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary basis of sex differences in brain structure.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

When subjected to multi-day exposures to either, chrna5 mutants exhibited greater behavioural change, but reduced transcriptomic changes compared to WT siblings, suggesting an impaired homeostatic regulation following drug exposure. Further, chrna5 mutants exhibited drug-independent changes in appetite and circadian rhythms, suggesting a genetic predisposition to disorders often comorbid with substance dependence.

L.; Schultz, P.; Bever, J.", "abstract": "Symbioses exert strong influences on host phenotypes; however, benefits from symbioses can increase or degrade over time. Understanding the context-dependence of reinforcing or degrading dynamics is pivotal to predicting stability of symbiotic benefits. Host phylogenetic relationships and host life history traits are two candidate axes that have been proposed to structure symbioses. However, the relative influence of host evolutionary history and life history on symbiont composition, and whether changes in symbiont composition translate into stronger mutualistic benefits is unknown. We tested the influence of plant phylogenetic relationships and plant life history on the composition of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, perhaps the most ancestral and influential of plant symbionts, and then tested whether AM fungal differentiation resulted in improved mutualism. We constructed mycobiomes composed of seven AM fungal isolates derived from tallgrass prairie and grew them for two growing seasons with 38 grassland plant species. We found that host phylogenetic structure was a significant predictor of the composition of AM fungal communities and the genetic composition of AM fungal species, patterns consistent with phylosymbiosis. However, the phylogenetic structure of AM fungi failed to translate to improved benefit to their host. While AM fungi generally improved plant growth and mycorrhizal feedback was generally positive, the strength of feedback was not predicted by plant phylogenetic distance. The composition of the AM fungal community and genetic composition within AM fungal species were also significantly influenced by plant life history. In addition, feedbacks between early and late successional species were generally positive. Interestingly, changes in species composition did not predict feedback, while changes in genetic composition of the two most abundant AM fungal species predicted positive mycorrhizal feedback. These reinforcing mycorrhizal feedbacks across life history can mediate plant species turnover during succession and suggests that consideration of mycorrhizal dynamics could improve restoration.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in revisiting and evaluating historical infection remedies for their antimicrobial activity. The Agave plant held significant social, religious, and medicinal value to the Mexica (commonly referred to as the Aztecs), as well as other Indigenous Mesoamerican communities. The use of Agave syrup mixed with salt was traditionally used in wound care as documented in the Florentine Codex, a sixteenth-century text authored by Spanish Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun. The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined through the microbroth dilution method, whilst anti-biofilm activity was measured using crystal violet staining. In this current study, we demonstrated that commercially available Agave syrups primarily derived from the Agave tequilana species significantly inhibit the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative wound-associated pathogens in planktonic culture. The traditional practice of adding salt enhanced the efficacy against Escherichia coli. Furthermore, Agave syrups significantly inhibited biofilm formation across all six organisms tested, although their capacity to disrupt pre-formed biofilms appears to be species specific. Preliminary investigations into the underlying antibacterial mechanisms of Agave syrups suggest that it is likely due to a combination of factors, including their acidic pH, along with the presence of saponins, methylglyoxal, and the generation of hydrogen peroxide. This study contributes to the growing evidence that historical remedies like Agave syrup may be effective as new antimicrobial treatments.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

This rise is primarily present in adult cancer, while in-silico investigation of genetic interactions remains challenging in pediatric cancer especially in tumors of low incidence. Consequently, this underscores the need for specialized approaches to advance our understanding of genetic interactions in pediatric oncology. Methods Here, we present the pathway-informed genetic interaction framework (PIGI) that employs mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence testing and leverages biological pathways to infer candidate genetic interactions. Pathways facilitate the detection of hidden biology by grouping genes in functional units, as well as alleviate key confounders of these analyses: pathway epistasis and cancer subtypes - thereby highlighting genes of greater interest. Results PIGI detected candidate genetic interactions by assessing pathway mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence in two primary pediatric cancer datasets, DKFZ and TARGET. PIGI detected, from high significance pathway relationships, 35 mutually exclusive and 2 co-occurring mutated gene pairs. The already known ME gene pair of TP53-DROSHA is detected in the much smaller collection of the DKFZ Wilms tumors.

In this pilot study, we analyzed the gut microbiome of dogs enrolled in a clinical trial of anti-EGFR/HER2 immunotherapy to identify microbial biomarkers associated with survival outcomes. Methods Rectal swab samples of 51 dogs were collected at the time of first vaccine administration (baseline microbiota) and underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing according to standard protocols. Results Microbiome composition showed no significant differences by cancer type, sex, or breed, suggesting no inherent microbiome bias in the cohort. However, Cox regression analysis revealed 11 bacterial taxa whose abundances were significantly associated with overall survival (FDR < 0.1), independently of cancer type. Seven taxa were linked to increased mortality risk, while four were associated with prolonged survival. These associations remained significant after adjusting for confounders such as hemangiosarcoma diagnosis and advanced age.

These approaches offer promising tools to enhance early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD), a prevalent and globally significant neuropsychiatric condition. Methodology Here we applied an integrated miRNomic and lipidomic approach to analyze plasma EVs from AUD patients and controls of both sexes to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Results We identified an AUD signature with predictive potential for diagnostic and prognostic applications. Individual features (e.g., hsa-miR-99b-3p, hsa-miR-556-5p, Cer_NDS d39:1, and PI 18:0_18:2) represented important components; however, the strength of this signature lay in the combined profile rather than isolated markers. We also revealed an AUD-sex signature that provided insight into how biological responses to alcohol differ between females and males (including features such as hsa-miR-1301-3p and PC 39:4), which also underscored the power of multi-omic integration. The individual miRNome approach also revealed an opposite functional alteration by sex in various alcohol related systems, such as pathways associated with immunity, oxidative stress, and autophagy. Conclusions While addressing the long-standing underrepresentation of females in alcohol-related research, this collective work also represents the first study to integrate EV-derived miRNA and lipid data to uncover sex-related pathophysiological pathways in AUD. Together, our findings underscore the added value of multi-omics integration in identifying clinically relevant molecular signatures of disease; this sex-informed approach offers a promising path toward more personalized diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies in AUD.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

F.; ASANO, E.", "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Since the era of Penfield, invasive neurophysiology has laid a lasting foundation for functional neuroscience by elucidating brain regions necessary for speech. However, whole-brain investigations have yet to distinguish the millisecond-scale dynamics and specific white matter pathways that support rapid naming in the auditory and visual domains. Methods: In this observational study, we constructed a whole-brain Dynamic Causal Tractography atlas using intracranial neurophysiological data from 125 neurosurgical patients. The resulting video atlas captured local cortical high-gamma activity and cortico-cortical coactivation via white matter tracts during rapid and delayed auditory and picture naming. Direct electrical stimulation was employed to assess the causal significance of the observed neural dynamics. Results: The atlas revealed white matter coactivation intensity patterns at specific 5-millisecond time windows that best aligned with sensorimotor and language symptoms elicited by electrical stimulation (Spearman's {rho} = 0.58-0.91; p = 4.8x10-7 to 1.6x10-25). Rapid auditory naming was associated with deactivation of the right rostral middle frontal gyrus and increased coactivation along the left arcuate fasciculus, linked to stimulation-induced receptive and expressive aphasia. In contrast, delayed auditory naming correlated with a late surge in bifrontal coactivation. Rapid picture naming involved early coactivation between cortices connected via the bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculi--associated with stimulation-induced visual distortions--coinciding with transient co-inactivation of Broca's area. Discussion: These findings delineate dissociable white matter-mediated mechanisms supporting rapid naming in the auditory and visual domains. Reduced inhibitory monitoring by the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may facilitate efficient lexical retrieval via left perisylvian pathways during auditory naming. In contrast, excessive bifrontal interaction may underlie delayed auditory naming. Rapid visual object recognition appears to rely on early occipitotemporal coactivation with minimal involvement of Broca's area. The resulting atlas--accompanied by a publicly available dataset (61.2 GB) and analysis code--serves as a valuable resource for students and trainees studying the network dynamics underlying speech, as well as for presurgical language mapping in patients undergoing cortical or subcortical intervention.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

However, the vast space of chemical and genetic perturbations makes it infeasible to fully explore all the potential perturbations with image-profiling technologies. Consequently, developing a powerful in-silico method to simulate high-fidelity cell morphological response under perturbations can reduce the experiment costs and accelerate drug discovery. Motivated by this, we proposed MorphDiff, a transcriptome-guided latent diffusion model for accurately predicting the cell morphology response to perturbations. We applied MorphDiff to two large-scale datasets, including one drug perturbation and one genetic perturbation cell morphology dataset covering thousands of diverse perturbations. Extensive benchmarking and comparison with baseline methods show the remarkable accuracy and fidelity of MorphDiff in predicting cell morphological changes under unseen perturbations. Furthermore, we explored the utilities of MorphDiff in identifying and retrieving the MOAs of drugs, which is a crucial application in phenotypic drug discovery. With the designed pipeline for MOA retrieval, we demonstrated MorphDiff's capability to boost the retrieval of the drug' MOAs (Mechanism Of Actions) by generating realistic cell morphology profiles. The average MOA retrieval accuracy of MorphDiff-generated morphology is comparable with that of the ground truth cell morphology, and consistently outperforms the baseline method and gene expression based retrieval by 29.1% and 9.7% respectively. We also validated that complementary information provided by cell morphology generated by MorphDiff can help discover drugs with dissimilar structures but the same MOAs. In summary, with its strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity cell morphology on unseen perturbations, we envision MorphDiff as a powerful tool in phenotypic drug discovery by accelerating the phenotypic screening of vast perturbation space and improving MOA identification.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Yet, the precise mechanism remains unclear. While carbonic anhydrases are well-established in cytoplasmic buffering, their function alone is incomplete without an associated bicarbonate transporter. To date, no such transporter has been identified in Leishmania or other protozoans. Using pharmacological inhibition and 13C-bicarbonate uptake assay, we demonstrate active bicarbonate uptake in Leishmania, implicating transmembrane transport. We report the identification of SLC26A homolog in the parasite, namely LmSLC26A, as the first bicarbonate transporter in Leishmania. Its localization to the plasma membrane is confirmed via immunofluorescence. Reduced Bicarbonate uptake and intracellular acidosis were observed in heterozygous knockout (LmSLC26A/-) parasites, leading to reduced growth and cell viability, which are rescued by exogenous bicarbonate. Furthermore, LmSLC26A/- parasites showed reduced infectivity in both the macrophage and murine models. Together with its role in pH homeostasis and survival in host environments, LmLSC26A is revealed to be a critical regulator of Leishmania pH homeostasis, essential for survival and virulence.

Fungal growth also requires the tight coordination of exocytosis (secretion) with endocytosis and recycling of proteins and lipids, which occurs in a defined region behind the growing tip known as the endocytic collar. Here, we genetically characterized proteins tentatively implicated in the formation of endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites, including Scs2/VAP, tricalbins and Ist2 homologues, in Aspergillus nidulans. We showed that among these proteins, only the single Scs2/VapA homologue is essential for normal fungal growth, and this requirement is due to the critical role of VapA in maintaining the polarized localization of apical cargoes, such as the lipid flippases DnfA and DnfB or the SNARE protein SynA. In {Delta}vapA mutants, these cargoes lose their polarized localization, a phenotype that correlates with the mislocalization of the AP-2 cargo adaptor complex, which is essential for the endocytosis and recycling of apical membrane components. Further analysis provides evidence linking the defect in apical cargo endocytosis observed in {Delta}vapA mutants to altered membrane lipid partitioning, suggesting that VapA contributes to lipid domain organization critical for cargo recycling. Strikingly, deletion of VapA does not impair the localization or endocytosis of non-polarized (subapical) plasma membrane transporters, indicating that the trafficking and biogenesis of polarized (apical) versus non-polarized (subapical) cargoes are differentially dependent on membrane lipid composition and domain-specific organization", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content negatively associates with insulin sensitivity, while endurance athletes exhibit IMCL levels were positively correlated to insulin sensitivity, which is known as the athlete's paradox. To solve this paradox, LDs were isolated from skeletal muscle samples of seven athletes and nine T2DM patients, and the first proteome dataset of human skeletal muscle LD was established. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed 733 upregulated proteins in athlete LDs, primarily enriched in mitochondria, and 755 downregulated proteins, mainly associated with cytoskeletal components, relative to T2DM patients. Integrated analysis with tissue proteomics further indicated enhanced energy metabolism activity of LD-anchored mitochondria (LDAM) in athletes. Notably, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was specifically upregulated by 2.97-fold on LDs in athletes, while its overall tissue expression remained unchanged. Moreover, deletion of ATGL in myoblasts significantly reduced insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation. Additionally, skeletal muscle LDs from db/db and ob/ob mice exhibited reduced levels of mitochondrial proteins and ATGL. Together, our findings reveal a LD-based solution for the athlete's paradox, and identify ATGL as a key regulator of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. The results also suggest that the \"bad LDs\" in the skeletal muscle of T2DM patients are characterized by higher levels of cytoskeletal proteins, reduced LDAM, and lower ATGL compared to the \"good LDs\" observed in athletes.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

A key mechanism modulating signal transduction relies on the formation of multimolecular complexes optimized for specificity, modularity and signal amplification. The scavenger receptor CD36, which binds diverse ligands in different cellular contexts, illustrates this principle. To uncover the nature of CD36 multimolecular complexes, we employed a proximity biotinylation labeling approach on human endothelial cells, where CD36 binds to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) to initiate a signaling cascade promoting programmed cell death. Using biotin capture and mass spectrometry protein identification, we uncovered a list of proteins in the vicinity of CD36. This list of candidates was refined by proximity ligation assays. The relationship between key CD36 interacting molecules, in particular active integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) and CD9, was further decoded by conditional colocalization analysis, providing support for their association within a tri-molecular complex. The implication of selected candidates in the signaling function of CD36 was further evaluated using shRNA knockdown, revealing that active ITGB1 is essential for Fyn activation downstream of CD36, with the tetraspanin playing a connecting role between CD36 and active ITGB1. Our approach to investigating CD36 complexes emphasizes the complexity and fundamental role of protein-protein interactions and coordination in the context of transmembrane signal transduction.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Changes in lipid homeostasis did not suppress this defect. Ryh1RAB6 is a Rab GTPase that resides in the Golgi and endosomes and facilitates or stabilizes the interaction between TORC2 and its substrate, the AGC kinase Gad8. We have found genetic and functional interactions between exomer and Ryh1RAB6. The recovery of TORC2 activity in response to KCl requires Ryh1RAB6 and exomer, and the localization of Ryh1RAB6 is aberrant in exomer mutants.

Here, we examined NBR1 regulation under proteotoxic stress in mATG8s deficient HeLa cells. NBR1 levels were elevated in mATG8s knockout (KO) cells under basal conditions but decreased significantly after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This reduction was not prevented by lysosomal inhibition with BafA1, indicating a non-lysosomal mechanism. Silencing of RAB27A reduced basal NBR1 levels, and the effects of MG132 were no longer observed, likely due to already diminished NBR1. Remaining NBR1 localized to puncta positive for ubiquitin and the ESCRT-0 component HRS, suggesting involvement of a ubiquitin-dependent endosomal pathway.

R.; Lomiyev, S.; Botelho, R. J.", "abstract": "Lysosomes are essential to clear unwanted cellular material delivered by constant membrane fusion. Membrane fission is thus required to balance lysosome size, number, and composition. PIKfyve is a lipid kinase that converts phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] to phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P2] and promotes lysosome fission since lysosomes coalesce into larger, but fewer organelles in PIKfyve defective cells. Here, we reveal a role for PIKfyve in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dynamics. We show the ER is less reticulated and motile in cells acutely inhibited for PIKfyve. Partly, this arises because lysosomes cluster perinuclearly and are less motile, which appears to arrest ER hitchhiking, a process in which lysosomes pull and form ER tubules via microtubule-based movement. Secondly, the ER morphology is distorted because of hyper-tethering of protrudin, an ER transmembrane protein, to lysosomes via excess PtdIns(3)P and FYVE domain of protrudin. Thus, our findings reveal that PIKfyve activity balances phosphoinositides at ER-lysosome contact sites to govern ER properties and has significant implications to our understanding of disease linked to PIKfyve dysfunction such as neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a multivariate computational approach to model paradoxical heat sensation (PHS), a thermosensory illusion in which skin cooling evokes sensations of warmth, as an individual-specific process. We tested 75 healthy adults (aged 21 to 80) using a perceptual decision-making task with stimuli designed to elicit PHS. Binary perceptual choices, response times and confidence ratings were jointly analysed using hierarchical multivariate Bayesian modelling to characterise PHS at both the population and individual levels across the lifespan. We tested two distinct perceptual profiles: ''true perceivers'', who experience PHS similarly to a veridical warm percept; and ''unsure perceivers'', who perceive PHS as an ambiguous experience. At the group level, behaviour was best explained by the unsure perceiver model, suggesting that PHS is often an uncertain experience, rather than a categorical misperception. At the individual level, however, both profiles were represented, with considerable inter-individual variability in model fit. Older participants were more likely to report PHS and did so at lower levels of thermal contrast, but we observed no correlation between age and perceptual profile. This suggests that while ageing increases the likelihood of experiencing PHS, it does not alter the qualitative nature of its perception. These findings also show how multivariate modelling of perceptual, decisional and metacognitive responses can reveal distinct subjective profiles and their variation across individuals and age.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

The statistician knows the sample and also has partial knowledge of the distribution from which the sample was drawn. We examine how observers carry out parametric estimation tasks that are also visual organization tasks. In our experiment the collections were one-dimensional statistical samples plotted along a horizontal line. They were drawn from one of three location families: the Gaussian, the Laplacian, and the Uniform. Observers saw only the sample and had to estimate the location of the generating probability density function. We compared human performance to unbiased minimum variance estimators (UMVUEs) for each family. We tested whether observers used the same or different estimators for all three distributional families and whether their estimators were UMVUEs. Observers used different estimators for different distributional families. The estimators chosen for samples from the Gaussian and Uniform distributions were significantly different from the corresponding UMVUEs while that for the Laplacian was not. We developed a model of human performance based on clusters in samples. Clusters convey information about the distributions from which they are drawn. We propose a Two-Stage Visual Cluster Model (VCM) of location estimation. The observer first partitions the sample into non-overlapping clusters assigning a location to each cluster and then computes a weighted average of the cluster locations with weights reflecting how well each cluster fit the entire sample. The VCM captured human performance across all three distributions.

We found that ciliary membranes are enriched in cholesterol and desmosterol while excluding precursors like 7-lathosterol and limiting others, suggesting a selective sterol barrier. Inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis at distinct enzymatic steps led to sterol accumulation, altered ciliary membrane fluidity, and impaired Hedgehog signaling, including defective Smoothened (Smo) retention-even in the presence of a constitutively active form of Smo. These findings link sterol homeostasis to ciliary membrane properties and signaling fidelity.

However, direct measurement of recombination rate remains challenging, as standard methods such as chiasma counts or genetic linkage mapsare labor-intensive and often infeasible for non-model species. In this study, we identify chromosome number and mean chromosome size as practical proxies for genome-wide recombination rate by analyzing genetic map data from 69 insect species and supplementary analyses of 157 monocentric flowering plants. Using both ordinary and phylogenetically informed Bayesian regression models, we show that recombination rate increases with chromosome number and decreases with mean chromosome size. Crucially, mean chromosome size is a significantly better predictor, particularly in holocentric species. This insight enables recombination rate estimation in thousands of species with known genome and chromosome sizes, thereby allowing hypothesis testing at scales previously unattainable. We also confirm the long-standing hypothesis that monocentric species have nearly twice as many crossovers per chromosome as holocentric species, reflecting structural constraints imposed by diffuse centromeres. Building on these results, we present predictive models applicable to poorly studied holocentric plants. Overall, our study highlights the pivotal role of chromosome architecture in recombination evolution and provides an accessible framework for evolutionary genomic research across diverse lineages.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

This is particularly problematic for the lower two-thirds of the formation, which generally lacks reliable biostratigraphic or magnetostratigraphic zonation and has no dated ash beds. To address these enduring issues for one of the most significant Upper Cretaceous terrestrial fossil-bearing units in North America, detailed stratigraphic sections were established on the Murray Ranch and on McGinnis Butte in central Montana and correlated with other published Hell Creek Formation localities via magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and radioisotopic dating of ash beds. Results indicate that the K-Pg boundary is not exposed in the study area, however high-precision U-Pb CA-TIMS zircon ages for two newly discovered ash beds (66.929 {+/-} 0.020 Ma and 66.850 {+/-} 0.026 Ma, respectively) bracketing the  Dueling Dinosaurs locality provide the first absolute ages for the lower portion of the Hell Creek Formation, anywhere. Bayesian age-stratigraphic modelling places the  Dueling Dinosaurs locality at 66.897 +0.023/-0.028 Ma and suggest that the age of the base of the formation is ~67.102 +0.710/-0.173 Ma (or older) in the study area.

This protocol integrates 3 key stages: (1) Extraction and purification of viable primary cells from ultra-small tissue specimens using the small-Tissue Extraction Device (sTED); (2) High-throughput fabrication of uniform cell-laden microspheres using an integrated microfluidic bioprinter (OrgFab), capable of generating over 100 organoids from just 10L of bioink; and (3) Rapid organoid characterization using lamination-based processing for single-cell analysis while preserving spatial context. The automated workflow minimizes manual intervention, reducing variability and enhancing reproducibility, making it suitable for high-throughput applications such as drug screening and disease modeling. Our method allows for the generation of patient-derived organoids that closely mimic the native tissue microenvironment, including diverse cell types and structural features, within a significantly reduced timeframe. This 3 stage protocol enhances the use of organoids in personalized medicine by enabling the rapid assessment of drug efficacy in patient-specific models.

In this study, we investigated the cfDNA fragmentomics in transposon elements (TEs), a special category of sequences accounting for around half of human genome. We discovered dynamics in fragmentomic features across various types of TEs in human cfDNA, including size, ending patterns and coverage, which were validated in mice and dogs. These dynamics highly correlate with epigenomic features associated with chromatin states, including DNA methylation and histone modification signals, demonstrating fundamental regulatory roles of chromatin state in cfDNA production. Furthermore, fragmentomic features within TEs were significantly altered in cancer samples, offering improved diagnostic performance compared to genome-wide fragmentomic measurements. Additionally, cfDNA coverage in TEs showed frequent imbalances between cancer and control samples in a TE- and cancer type-dependent manner, presenting a promising biomarker for cancer diagnosis. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) on cfDNA fragmentomic features within TEs, we developed high-performance models, named TEANA (TE Analysis in cell-free DNA), for cancer diagnosis and tumor-origin prediction.

Inspired by ecological principles, this multi-strike approach aims to eradicate tumors not through a singular \"magic bullet\" but through a series of therapies after standard frontline treatment when the tumor is still, and perhaps most, vulnerable. We present a framework leveraging mathematical modeling (MM) to develop personalized multi-strike protocols for HGSOC. Key contributions include: 1) An \"IMOme\" score using liquid biopsy data to assess patient-specific hematopoietic toxicity risk, guiding the timing and selection of subsequent therapies, 2) MM strategies to design effective low-dose combinations of targeted agents to achieve synthetic lethality while managing toxicity, and 3) A MM framework to analyze the interplay between chemotherapy, gut microbiome toxicity, and immunotherapy, demonstrating how mitigating microbiome damage could enhance immune response.

Infiltration and oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the arterial wall and chronic inflammation comprise central pathogenetic mechanisms in ASCVD. Scavenger receptors, particularly Stabilin-1 (Stab1) and Stabilin-2 (Stab2), are pivotal in the clearance of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) cholesterol and pro-atherogenic ligands from circulation. However, their role in atherosclerosis development in the spectrum of T2DM remains poorly characterized. We assessed circulating levels of Stab1, Stab2, and their ligands (TGFbI, Periostin and Reelin) in a cohort of 33 T2DM and 21 non-diabetic individuals, stratified by their atherosclerotic plaque burden as assessed by high-resolution vascular ultrasound. Associations between stabilins, their ligands and conventional cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated. Stab1 levels were significantly elevated in individuals with higher atherosclerotic plaque burden (p<0.05), while Reelin levels were marginally elevated, both in the total study cohort and among T2DM patients. Stab1 levels positively correlated with body mass index and inversely correlated with total cholesterol, LDL, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Our findings indicate that Stab1 may serve as a marker of dysregulated lipid metabolism and increased atherosclerotic plaque burden in individuals with T2DM. Larger prospective studies are warranted to establish the prognostic and potentially therapeutic value of Stab1 and to clarify its mechanistic role in diabetic atherosclerosis.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

E.; Kriegeskorte, N.", "abstract": "Representational similarity analysis (RSA) characterizes the geometry of neural activity patterns elicited by different stimuli while discarding information about neural response preferences, regional population-mean activity and the absolute location and orientation of the patterns in the multivariate response space. Analyses of the tuning of individual neurons or voxels and of the population-mean activation are often performed separately from RSA and thought of as serving complementary purposes. When evaluating alternative representational models, invariance to certain aspects of the neural code is desirable because systems might use superficially different encodings to implement the same computations. However, neural preferences and regional-mean activation are arguably physiologically and mechanistically important, and so we may want for our models to predict them correctly. Here we introduce a novel analysis technique, framed RSA, which honors both the geometry and the population-mean preferences in evaluating model-predicted representations. To achieve this, we augment the set of patterns that define the geometry by two reference patterns: the zero-point (origin) and a uniform constant pattern in the multivariate response space, enabling RSA to incorporate information about the global location, orientation, and mean activation of neural population codes. First we present the mathematical and methodological underpinnings of framed RSA, including how it interacts with different RSA analysis choices, such as the use of cross-validated dissimilarity estimates and whitened RDM comparators. Second, we show empirically that framed RSA generally improves accuracy for both brain-region identification (using fMRI data from the Natural Scenes Dataset and the Things Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset) and deep-neural-network-layer identification relative to existing RSA approaches. By incorporating neural population preferences into model evaluation, framed RSA enables more mechanistically meaningful model comparisons and benefits from improved power for model-comparative inference.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The mechanism by which prions composed of PrPSc cause the neuropathological aberrations characteristic of prion diseases remains elusive. Previous studies have defined a synaptotoxic signaling pathway in which extracellular PrPSc stimulates NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx, activation of p38 MAPK, and collapse of the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines, resulting in functional decrements in synaptic transmission. However, these studies did not distinguish the source of the PrPSc that activates the signaling pathway: extracellular PrPSc bound to PrPC on the neuronal surface, or membrane-anchored PrPSc generated by the PrPC-PrPSc conversion process. To address this question, we employed two different experimental strategies, both of which interfere with PrPC-PrPSc conversion: (1) neuronal expression of PrPC mutants that are locked in the PrPC conformation (G126V and V208M); and (2) application of extracellular PrPSc from a species (mouse or hamster) that is unable to convert neuronal PrPC of the other species. We first confirmed that both of these strategies resulted in impaired PrPC-PrPSc conversion in cultured N2a and CAD5 cell lines. To assay synaptotoxicity, we then used lentiviral transduction to express the PrPC variants in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from PrP-null mice, and quantitated dendritic spine density after exposure to purified prions. Expression of G126V PrP completely prevented spine retraction in response to three different murine prion strains (RML, 22L, and ME7), while the effect of V208M PrP was strain-dependent, consistent with partial stabilization of PrP structure by this mutation. Expression of hamster PrPC or mouse PrPC greatly attenuated spine retraction in response to murine 22L and hamster 263K prions, respectively. These findings support a model in which newly formed PrPSc at the neuronal surface is required to initiate prion-mediated synaptotoxic signaling. This work also suggests use of the G126V mutation as part of a therapeutic strategy to reduce PrPSc conversion in prion diseases.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

In real-world vision, voluntary attention can be directed by a wide range of influences such as reward, priming, meaning, experience, selection history, and volition. Laboratory studies of voluntary attention have commonly used attention-directing cues to induce or instruct human subjects to attend one class of stimuli while ignoring others. In recent years, free choice conditions of attention have been introduced, where self-generated volitional shifts of attention (willed attention) are possible (for a review, see Nadra & Mangun, 2023). Prior willed attention studies have focused on mechanisms of covert spatial attention, investigating the neurophysiological correlates of willed attention related to both post-decision processing, and the pre-decision brain activity patterns that predict participants' free choices about where to attend. Much less work, however, has been done on willed non-spatial attention. In this study, in a fashion similar to prior willed spatial attention studies, we investigated willed attention to stimulus color. In a trial-by-trial cueing design, subjects were either cued what color to attend or were allowed to freely choose what color to attend, in order to subsequently discriminate visual features of the cued or willfully chosen target. Behavioral measures showed that the subjects were selectively attending the cued or willed color. Using support vector machine decoding on EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) signals, we found significant post-decision differences in alpha-band power and broadband EEG voltage when participants chose to attend to orange versus purple.

Here, we discovered that Pdk1 localizes to eisosomes, which create invaginations in the plasma membrane, in addition to the spindle pole body (SPB). Pdk1 promotes phosphorylation of the core eisosome protein Pil1 and regulates the length of eisosomes. Dysregulated eisosomes are not responsible for cytokinesis defects previously observed in pdk1{triangleup} cells. Instead, we found that Pdk1 regulates localization of the anillin-like protein Mid1 and the protein kinase Sid2, which promotes cytokinesis as part of the septation initiation network (SIN). Our combined results provide insights into the role of Pdk1 in eisosomes and cytokinesis, which extend the functions of this conserved protein kinase family beyond canonical growth control pathways.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we report OptoChaperone, a light-activatable molecular system designed to manipulate protein condensates both in vitro and in living cells. This biohybrid system leverages photoresponsive switching to control chaperone activity: blue light triggers the suppressive function, leading to the dissolution of protein condensates, whereas UV light deactivates the system, allowing condensate formation. We demonstrate the efficacy of OptoChaperone in regulating several disease-related protein condensates, such as fused in sarcoma, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, and heat shock factor 1. Importantly, the system exhibits reversible and robust control over droplet dynamics without requiring chemical additives or genetic modifications of the client proteins. Given the reversibility and efficiency of OptoChaperone in the manipulation of protein condensates, this tool offers a powerful platform for dissecting the roles of protein condensation in cellular physiology and pathology.

Human triple-negative breast cancer cells cultured in 2D under media conditions mimicking five different dietary states show no observable differences in proliferation or morphology. Nonetheless, those exposed to high-fat conditions exhibit increased metabolic activity and upregulate genes associated with motility and extracellular matrix remodeling. In the 3D microfluidic model, high-fat conditions accelerate tumor growth and invasion and induce the formation of hollow cavities.

The aim of this study is to molecularly characterize endometrium and endometriosis using marker-independent Raman microspectroscopy to identify potential biomarkers and validate its diagnostic potential. After histopathological characterization of tissue sections of human endometrium and endometriosis, Raman microspectroscopy was performed on the gland region. Multivariate analysis of the hyperspectral maps was used to localize major subcellular structures and further decipher their molecular composition. Samples from different anatomical regions and throughout all menstrual cycle phases were analyzed. Raman imaging enabled label-free visualization of tissue morphology and submolecular tissue characterization. Distinct differences between endometrium and endometriosis were found for collagen type I and nuclear signatures. Spectral deconvolution allowed identification of a Raman biomarker indicative of fibrotic changes in endometriosis samples. Additionally, a significant increase in epigenetic 5mC foci and an increased signal intensity relevant for methylations was detected in nuclei of endometriosis. Furthermore, a neural network-based classification of Raman data resulted in high accuracies in discriminating endometrial and peritoneal tissue from endometriosis.

Here, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to map single-cell stiffness of Xenopus laevis embryos, a model of regulative development, from early cleavage (stage 6) to the onset of gastrulation (stage 11). To ensure stable AFM mapping, vitelline membrane-removed embryos were immobilized in custom grooved agarose wells and gently held using a dulled glass pipette. AFM observations revealed marked mechanical heterogeneity within the animal hemisphere: stiffness in apical cytoplasmic regions, which are defined as the central apical surface excluding cell-cell boundaries, varied among cells, regardless of size, indicating intrinsic variability. Cell-cell boundaries consistently showed high stiffness, suggesting strong adhesion, as commonly observed in epithelial monolayers in vitro. In contrast, in the vegetal hemisphere during gastrulation, cell-cell boundaries exhibited low stiffness, indicative of weaker adhesion. Additionally, micron-scale stiff inclusions were detected in the apical vegetal cytoplasm, with sizes comparable to those of yolk platelets. These findings demonstrate the capability of AFM to probe the microscale mechanical architecture of developing regulative embryos and to uncover regional mechanical asymmetries between the animal and vegetal hemispheres. Such asymmetries may contribute to key morphogenetic processes during early vertebrate development.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Here we leverage Locomotor Inactivity During Sleep (LIDS), previously established in adults as an accessible means to track sleep cycles, to chart ultradian sleep cycle dynamics within the first year of life at scale. Specifically, we analyzed > 35, 000 hours of sleep from a longitudinal dataset of 152 infants with 10 days of actigraphy at 3, 6, and 12 months of age.

Cycles were not only shorter in infants than parents (-11.8 min, 95% C.I.

However, this paper demonstrates that the application of Kalman filters in the BMI field violates the model's own assumptions and numerous neuroscience principles, resulting in six critical limitations: (1) the observation matrix mapping from kinematics to neural activity causes individual neurons to be modeled independently, ignoring neural population activity; (2) aligned kinematic and neural activity sequences fail to capture preparatory information; (3) the presence of behaviorally irrelevant neural activity causes observation weights to be excessively underestimated; (4) noise in the observation matrix renders posterior covariance estimates biased; (5) Kalman gain computation in observation space leads to repeated noise accumulation and (6) computational inefficiency. All these problems can be resolved through a simple perspective shift: separating the decoder from the Kalman filter and treating its predicted kinematics as the Kalman filter's observation rather than neural activity. Experiments conducted on CRCNS-recorded monkey dorsal premotor area and primary motor signals performing computer cursor control tasks validate the existence of the six limitations and their violations of neuroscience principles, while demonstrating the superiority of the improved Kalman filter across all evaluated metrics.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we revisited pioneering observations that trial-by-trial variability in either the SC or V1 may predict variability in eye movement timing. We found that V1 covariation with behavioral variability was virtually non-existent in comparison to the SC, whether with respect to visual response onset latency, visual response strength, or pre-stimulus state. By far, the largest predictor of behavioral variability was visual response strength in SC visual-motor neurons.

The present study explored the expansion by examining types of diversity in sub-Saharan Africans: cranial shape (13 populations), autosomal (20 populations), X-chromosomal (17 populations), and, adjusting for minimum temperature, mitochondrial (20 populations). A ranking procedure indicated, across diversities, where the expansion originated. Each diversity declined with increasing distance from some location in Africa. Findings with autosomal diversity appeared to be driven by the datapoint for Somalis. A southern origin was specified by cranial and X-chromosomal diversities. No singular region was identified by autosomal or mitochondrial diversities. Simultaneous examination of diversities suggested a southern origin. Therefore, within Africa, diversities indicate an expansion from southern Africa. Admixture is a known obstacle for studying expansion.

The establishment of polyploid populations is often reported to be associated with harsh environmental conditions, and stress tolerance in particular, which have led to the widespread view that polyploidy-specific niche requirements are key to their persistence at ecological and evolutionary timescales. Here, we reevaluate this perspective through a classical mathematical model of polyploid establishment, for which we provide new analytical and numerical results, along with an empirical case study. We show that simple eco-evolutionary processes at the margins of diploid range-expansion waves, more specifically ecological drift and dispersal limitation, can be sufficient to allow polyploid populations to carve out their own space, without any a priori adaptive advantage over their diploid ancestors. Our modelling effort reveals three key insights. First, polyploids most readily gain a foothold at the low-density front of a diploid range expansion wave, where ecological drift is strongest. Second, limited dispersal accelerates spatial clustering of polyploid organisms through assortative mating. Third, once spatially segregated, diploid and polyploid populations experience different environments, so natural selection can drive niche divergence. We illustrate these interconnected principles by simulating the phylogeographic history of a well-documented autopolyploid complex of Neobatrachus Australian burrowing frogs. Altogether, our results provide a neutral baseline against which the ecological consequences of polyploidization can be readily detected and inferred within natural populations.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate RQC-mediated quality control of CFTR, a large transmembrane protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. Reporter assays show that although a sizeable fraction of nascent CFTR expressed in HEK293 cells arrests during translation and activates the RQC, multiple interventions compromising CFTR folding and membrane insertion do not exacerbate this response. CFTR translation abortion was also largely unaffected by regulators of translation kinetics such as codon usage, the ribosome collision sensor GCN1, and the SRP ER targeting complex.

We applied this approach to profile three high-throughput sequencing platforms - NovaSeq6000, NovaSeqX, and Salus Pro - using Escherichia coli datasets. By analyzing mismatches within fully overlapping 150 bp read regions, ErrorProfiler effectively distinguished sequencing-specific errors from PCR or library preparation artifacts. NovaSeqX exhibited the lowest median sequencing error rate (0.0089%), with minimal cycle-dependent drift. Salus PRO followed (0.0124%), outperforming NovaSeq6000 (0.0185%). Base quality score calibration analysis revealed systematic underestimation of base-call accuracy across all platforms. Illumina binned Q-score models (Q11/Q25/Q37; Q12/Q24/Q40) masked substantial intra-bin variability, while Salus Pro continuous Q-score system offered finer granularity but still overestimated error probabilities in key bins. A previously unreported \"upstream effect\" was observed, where the empirical accuracy of a base-call was significantly influenced by the Q-score of its preceding base. This effect was most pronounced in high-Q bins and consistent across all platforms. Substitution error spectra revealed distinct platform-specific and sequence-context-dependent biases, driven by optical systems and detection chemistry.

While the static flexibility of DNA is well-characterised by the bending elasticity or persistence length, no equivalent quantity related to how quickly it responds to external mechanical or thermal forces has to date been characterised. Here, by analysing the single molecule fluctuations of DNA several kilobases long, and by developing new theory for bending dissipation in semiflexible polymers, we show that DNA bending dynamics cannot be explained by friction between DNA and the solvent alone and requires significant contribution of intramolecular DNA friction. This defines a new material constant of DNA - the bending friction constant - which we determined to be {zeta}B = 241{+/-}17g nm3/ms. This magnitude corresponds to bending friction dominating dynamics of short DNA - up to {approx}420nm or 1.24kbp - and a characteristic persistence time of DNA shapes of {approx}1.2ms. Using these values, our theory accurately predicts measured spontaneous looping times without any fitting parameters in stark contrast to the prevailing theory based only on solvent friction with DNA, which underestimates these times by 1,000-fold. Our measurement of DNA bending friction is also insensitive to changes in electrostatic screening suggesting that it is related to the local and complex energy barriers due to Watson-Crick base-pairs, base-stacking and their interaction with water molecules as DNA bends; this localised nature suggests an opportunity for biology to use specific sequence motifs to tailor the friction response of DNA. These findings change our understanding of DNA bending dynamics and highlight the nature of the fundamental trade-off between the speed limit for DNA bending by spontaneous fluctuations, versus the energy cost of manipulating DNA by enzymes, as necessitated by biological function and ultimately, natural selection.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Interestingly, the immune system often produces cross-reactive antibodies, with anticipated role in neutralizing point mutations in HIV surface proteins by cross-reacting with mutants and tolerating them. In light of this paradox, we explored the mystery of immune evasion and antibody promiscuity by screening single chain variable fragment (scFvs) antibodies against several crucial HIV-1 gp41 epitopes using a phage display library. These findings underscore the broader significance of cross-reactive antibodies. Here, high-affinity cross-reactive scFvs showed physiologically relevant affinities with peptide epitopes, their analogs, and the native HIV-1 gp41 protein. We determined the crystal structure of a high-affinity cross-reactive scFv, DE94, and obtained insights into the molecular interactions of scFv antibodies with peptide epitopes and its natural mutants using molecular docking studies. This analysis of cross-reactive antibodies could contribute to the therapeutic development against immune-evading pathogens and paves the way for innovative strategies for combating viral infections, including emerging global threats.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

J.; Roberts, L.; Roberts, J. A.; Fulton, D.; Hill, L.; Kitchen, P.; Bill, R. M.; Botfield, H.", "abstract": "Haemorrhagic stroke is a devastating condition characterised by vessel rupture and free blood within the brain parenchyma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filled spaces. Across the major subtypes of haemorrhagic stroke (subarachnoid, intracerebral, and intraventricular haemorrhages), the presence of blood in the CSF generates significant tissue damage in the first 72 hours after the event, known as early brain injury (EBI). EBI includes neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier breakdown and dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics. ECM dysfunction has been shown to trigger fibrosis of the cortical blood vessels, limiting normal CSF circulation and resulting in the buildup of metabolic waste or the development of post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Limiting or preventing this fibrosis may therefore reduce the rate of morbidity experienced by survivors, providing a potential avenue for non-surgical treatment to reduce secondary brain injury post-stroke. Despite this, current in vivo approaches fail to differentiate between the effect of blood products and secondary consequences including intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation and mass effect. Here, we describe an adult rat organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC) model of haemorrhagic stroke which enables the identification of the effect of blood products on ECM dysregulation. We demonstrate the distribution of key cell types across a time course of 0, 3 and 7 days in culture, indicating that such cultures are viable for a minimum of 7 days. Using immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting and RNA sequencing, we show that exposure of OBSCs to lysed blood markedly increases ECM deposition around cortical blood vessels. This is accompanied by dysregulation of ECM regulatory genes and upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress-related genes, successfully recapitulating the changes seen in human stroke survivors. This versatile ex vivo model provides a translational platform to further understanding of haemorrhagic stroke pathophysiology and develop or trial novel therapeutics prior to progression to in vivo stroke studies.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we used occupancy models to estimate what proportion of spatial units (both non-natural and forest) a given species occupied annually in the plantation. Models with different covariates were tested for species for which most data were available: 13 birds, 7 mammals, among which the iconic Orangutan Pongo pygmaeus, and 3 reptiles. For each species, the model which best fitted the data was selected. Two shortcomings in our data complicated the analyses. First, occupancy models require detection and non-detection records, but because no fixed species lists were used, there is no unique way to generate non-detections. We generated non-detection records in several ways and ran the models again to evaluate the consequences for occupancy estimates. Second, imbalances in sampling may occur because of a lack of sampling design to select study sites. Most concerning are sites were surveyed only once in 2020-2024. We ran the models without those sites to examine whether results were different. Although the shortcomings mentioned turned out not to distort our results, the occupancy estimates were imprecise for many study species because of low detection rates, and extra efforts are needed to improve that.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to investigate the effects of dehydration on diabetic nephropathy(DN) and the underlying mechanisms of injury. Methods We analyzed clinical outcomes in 81 dehydration-induced acute kidney injury patients (35 with diabetes) and validated findings in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice subjected to intermittent water deprivation (WD). Renal function, histopathology, and molecular markers (FXR, TonEBP, AQP2, gp91, apoptosis regulators) were assessed. Results Kidney injury was aggravated after water deprivation in patients with diabetics and it is difficult to recover after water supplementation, with poor prognosis. Animal experiments have shown that compared with mice in a normal state, dehydration challenge aggravated renal damage in diabetic mice with increased serum creatinine, pathological damage, and renal interstitial cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, in a normal state FXR-TonEBP axis was enhanced to protect the kidney after water deprivation challenge, but this compensatory protective response was blunted in the diabetic state.

U.", "abstract": "Humans typically respond faster to multisensory signals than to their unisensory components, a phenomenon known as the redundant signal effect (RSE). One of the earliest and most influential accounts, the race model, attributes the RSE to statistical facilitation, which arises from parallel, independent processing across sensory modalities. While this model captures some key features of the RSE, it frequently underestimates the observed speed-up leading to violations of the race model inequality (RMI), a benchmark used to test the models validity. To reconcile this discrepancy, we introduce the relay model, a minimal extension of the race architecture that incorporates cross-modal initiation. In this model, responses result from two sequential race processes, allowing a signal in one modality to trigger the onset of perceptual decision processing in another. This structure retains statistical facilitation as a core principle while introducing a single free model parameter that divides unisensory processing into gating and decision stages. Through simulations and fits to foundational empirical datasets, we show that the relay model captures both the magnitude and distributional shape of the RSE, including RMI violations. It also accounts for changes in the RSE under asynchronous stimulus onsets, a critical test in multisensory integration research. By extending the classical race model with minimal added complexity, the relay model offers a mechanistically explicit and biologically plausible framework for explaining the dynamics of multisensory decision-making.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

How does the brain use such error signals for learning? While global error signals can be useful, their ability to learn complex computation at the scale observed in the brain is lacking. In comparison, more local, neuron-specific error signals enable superior performance, but their computation and propagation remain unclear. Motivated by the breakthrough of deep learning, this has inspired the \"backpropagation and the brain\" hypothesis, i.e. that the brain implements a form of the error backpropagation algorithm. In this work, we introduce a biologically motivated, multi-area cortical microcircuit model, implementing error backpropagation under consideration of recent physiological evidence. We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation. We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas.

Predictive coding models fall into the latter category and propose that repetitions are expected and therefore elicit smaller prediction error responses. While studies in the visual and auditory domain provide some support for such models, in nociception evidence remains inconclusive, despite the substantial influence expectations exert on pain perception. To assess expectation effects on repetition suppression in nociception, we developed a paradigm in which healthy volunteers received brief CO2 laser stimuli, while we acquired electroencephalographic (EEG) and peripheral physiological data. Importantly, laser stimuli could be either repeated after one second or not be repeated, with the probability of repetitions manipulated in a block-wise fashion, such that repetitions were either expected or unexpected. We observed repetition suppression in laser-evoked potentials as well as laser-induced gamma band oscillations, but not in laser-induced desynchronisations in the alpha and beta band. Critically, neither these EEG responses, nor the peripheral physiological data showed significant differences between the expectation conditions, with Bayesian analyses mostly providing evidence for an absence of effects. This indicates that repetition suppression to brief nociceptive laser stimuli is not driven by top-down factors, but rather mediated by other adaptation processes. While this does not preclude an influence of predictive coding models in nociception, it suggests that when the nervous system receives highly precise input, its responses are less susceptible to influence from expectations.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Among its many negative impacts, heightened noise can impair communication in vocal animals through acoustic masking. Conceptually, noise reduces the animal's communication space -- the area in which an individual animal can effectively convey information to a conspecific listener. Previous studies have estimated the communication space using sound propagation models and/or behavioral studies. However, studies frequently equate signal recognition with signal detection -- a necessary but not sufficient precondition -- thereby persistently overestimating spatial coverage and underestimating anthropogenic impacts. Measuring communication is inherently difficult, and varies with taxa, call type, and context, leading to significant data gaps in key parameters. We propose that deep learning creates an opportunity to estimate biologically-relevant communication, even for data-limited species. In particular, we present a case study with the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis; hereafter NARW). Prior research has demonstrated that the upcall -- a low-frequency contact call produced across ages and sexes -- encodes individual identity. We therefore consider a dataset of NARW vocalizations recorded with on-animal archival tags, spanning 234 samples across 11 individuals from 3 sites. First, we demonstrate that audio embeddings from the BirdNET model can robustly distinguish individual right whales. Then, we simulate the effect of varying ambient noise levels to estimate signal excess for both signal detection and individual identification. Altogether, we hope this work provides both a methodological advance for individual identification and a framework for better understanding anthropogenic impacts on vocal wildlife.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Therefore, effective inhibition of MMP-2 is a desirable target for treatment. In some reports, the chlorotoxin (Ctx) polypeptide produced by the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus, interacts with human MMP-2 to inhibit tumor invasion without affecting surrounding tissue. We employed three molecular docking methodologies followed by molecular dynamics simulations to find consensus binding and calculate the binding energy of these peptide ligands to MMP-2. In addition to the Ctx itself, four C-terminal fragments were chosen to study their binding to MMP-2. The molecular docking platforms HPEPDOCK, HADDOCK, and AlphaFold2 created peptide - protein poses for each candidate binding to MMP-2. These poses underwent 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations. Peptide binding on MMP-2 and final binding energies were calculated using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area method. Configurational entropy and root-mean square deviation analyses showed stable peptide - protein complexes. Ctx and its peptide fragments frequently bound to regions on MMP-2 other than the catalytic site. All docking methods shared consensus on large negative binding energies, indicating favorable interaction between Ctx and its analogs with MMP-2. While Ctx and its fragments bind to MMP-2, there is no consensus on which region of MMP-2 they are bound to or which peptide binds strongest. Neither Ctx nor its fragments inhibited MMP-2 enzymatic activity, however, glioblastoma cellular migration was inhibited.

Targeting this interaction represents a potential therapeutic strategy. In this study, we determined the X-ray structure of the E PBM peptide in complex with the ZO-1 PDZ2 domain at 1.7 A resolution. The structure revealed a domain-swapped dimer conformation of ZO-1 PDZ2, with the E PBM peptide conventionally bound within the PDZ domain's canonical binding groove exhibiting key interactions characteristic of type II PBM-PDZ interactions. To identify potential inhibitors of the E PBM/ZO-1 PDZ2 interaction, we performed a HTRF screening using a protein-protein interaction-focused library of 1,000 compounds. This led to the identification of 36 hits that disrupted this interaction. Subsequent cytotoxicity and dose-response assays narrowed the selection to 14 promising compounds. Docking simulations showed that some compounds bind within or near the PBM-binding pocket, supporting a competitive mechanism of interaction inhibition, while others bind at a central interface between the two PDZ monomers, suggesting an inhibition of dimerization, which in turn prevents PBM binding. Thus, the ZO-1 PDZ2/E PBM interaction can be inhibited through both direct and indirect mechanisms.

Despite well-established iron accumulation in the AD brain, its role in exacerbating A{beta} toxicity is often overlooked in therapeutic research. We developed a 3D ex vivo organotypic brain slice cultures (OBSC) with A{beta} monomers and ferric citrate to mimic A{beta} deposits and iron overload to investigate the impact of excess iron on A{beta} toxicity in pig and human brains. Light and electron microscopy, biochemical assays, and multiple regression modeling were employed to assess iron-mediated A{beta} toxicity in neurons and glial cells. We show that OBSC offer a close approximation of in vivo morphological and physiological properties and can retain both neurons and glial cells for extended periods, and respond to experimental manipulations. We show that iron promotes A{beta} fibrillization into long fibrils, with this process further influenced by temperature. A{beta} selectively accumulated in neurons, leading to their death, sparing glial cells. In contrast, Iron, though generally toxic to neurons, exhibited unspecific cytotoxicity. Notably, the combined presence of A{beta} and iron synergistically increased neuronal death while reducing glial cell loss. Correlation analysis revealed that this synergic interaction enhances the toxicity of each other in a mutual fashion - A{beta} directs the neuronal toxicity while iron promotes A{beta} fibrillization, leading to targeted neuronal loss. In conclusion, our findings emphasize the critical role of excess iron and A{beta} in driving neuronal death in AD, underlining the importance of targeting iron accumulation along with A{beta} clearance but also addressing in future AD therapies, while also supporting our OBSC model as a valuable platform for studying the same.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Background Iron overload is a frequently underrecognized condition with a rising global prevalence. Excessive accumulation of iron has been considered a risk factor for the exacerbation of bacterial infections. Ca2+ is universally recognized as an indispensable cation for cell signaling. L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (LVDCCs) facilitate the transport of Ca2+ and Fe2+ ions into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. A non-protein molecule acting as a calcium channel has been found in prokaryotes. This finding has led to the proposal of a variety of signaling mechanisms for Ca2+ in bacteria. By combining research regarding the proliferation of bacteria exposed to iron and the potential role of Amlodipine not only as a mediator of iron overload at the cellular level but also as a growth inhibiting agent, we aim to test whether Amlodipine would have significant effects on the growth of E. Coli in iron-enriched microenvironments. Methods Ferrous sulfate was utilized to simulate an iron overloaded environment in-vitro by creating an agarose gel mixed with ferrous sulfate. E. coli was uniformly inoculated across the plates using standardized dilution protocol. A zone of inhibition test consisted of soaking sterile paper disks in increasing concentrations of Amlodipine (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 mg/mL) and placing them on the agar. Zones of inhibition were measured, and results were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA for assessment of statistically significant differences between the means of the 6 groups and post-hoc Tukey HSD testing for comparison of individual groups to one another. Results Amlodipine exhibited a statistically significant, dose-dependent inhibition of E. coli growth (p = 6.1594 * 10^(-9)). The diameter of the zones of inhibition increased consistently with Amlodipine concentration, with an R-squared value of 0.9885, indicating a strong correlation. Higher concentrations of Amlodipine showed the greatest growth inhibiting effect, while the control group lacking Amlodipine exhibited little to no inhibition. Conclusion This study suggests that Amlodipine may inhibit bacterial growth in iron-overloaded conditions, highlighting its potential as an adjunct therapeutic option for patients with infections who are simultaneously at risk of iron overload. Further in vivo studies are warranted to assess its clinical relevance.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

Recently, research on the MAM has gained momentum due to its significant role in immune and metabolic health. However, the study of the MAM is limited by conventional experimental techniques, as sampling this microbiome often requires invasive procedures, making in vivo research challenging. Additionally, obtaining samples from the MAM can compromise the lumen, complicating simultaneous studies of both the MAM and the lumen. To address these limitations, we present the TIM-2muc, an advanced version of the colonic in vitro model TIM-2, which includes a mucus compartment comprising both colonic mucus beads - Gut3Beads and an electrospun sheet coated with Gut3Gel. To validate whether the integrated mucus compartment behaves like the in vivo MAM, we examined the bacterial composition, alpha and beta diversity, and the MAM's composition compared to the lumen compartment of both the TIM-2muc and the conventional TIM-2 model. Our findings suggest that the MAM in the TIM-2muc model closely resembles its in vivo counterpart, thereby enhancing the physiological relevance of the luminal microbiome.

Three groups of 17-week-old (point-of-lay) hens were inoculated with three precursor H7N7-LPAIV candidates which possessed: Group 1 - the classic LPAIV single-basic cleavage site (CS) (H7N7-SBCS); Group 2 - the dibasic CS (H7N7-DBCS) discovered at the outbreak (both represented direct H7N7-HPAIV (2008) precursors); Group 3 - a related European H7N7-LPAIV (2008) which possessed a DBCS within its haemagglutinin (HA) gene which was highly-conserved with the HA of the UK (2008) outbreak H7N7-HPAIV, but its other genetic segments differed.

F.; Almazan, F.; Rodriguez, D.", "abstract": "Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV) (Avibirnavirus genus, Birnaviridae family) is a non-enveloped virus with a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome. IBDV causes a highly contagious and immunosuppressive disease in domestic chickens (Gallus gallus), representing a major threat to the global poultry industry. Apoptotic cell death and exacerbated innate immune responses have been implicated in IBDV pathogenesis. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the crucial role of type I interferon (IFN) in triggering apoptosis in IBDV-infected cell cultures. Genomic IBDV dsRNA is recognized by the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) in chicken cells, triggering type I IFN responses. However, the contribution of the endosomal PRR Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) dsRNA sensor on type I IFN production upon IBDV infection has not been studied, despite several studies have demonstrated that its expression is significantly upregulated upon IBDV infection. Here, we demonstrate that ablation of TLR3 gene expression in DF-1 chicken fibroblasts results in a complete blockade of IBDV-induced apoptosis, a marked reduction in IFN production, and a significant enhancement of virus progeny yields. Notably, this effect appears to be specific to IBDV, as similar outcomes were not observed with other RNA viruses. Our findings also suggest that TLR3 may also play a role in viral release into the extracellular space. Additionally, receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), a protein that interacts with TLR3 through the adaptor Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-{beta} (TRIF), was shown to contribute to both IFN production and apoptosis in response to IBDV infection or dsRNA stimulation in DF-1 cells. Overall, this study provides new insights into the innate immune recognition of IBDV, highlighting the central role of TLR3 in mediating antiviral responses in chicken cells.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

These communities are tremendously diverse, making it challenging to assign relevant functions to individual species. Fungal communities may be differentiated at the level of functional guilds; beyond such broad classification we have little delimitation, especially in fungal taxa common in grassland and agricultural soils. To resolve the level of functional similarity in fungal communities and define traits predictive of soil carbon cycling, we characterized fungal isolates abundant in agricultural soils to test the hypotheses that (i) the majority of saprobic soil fungi have the ability to use complex carbon sources, (ii) differences in complex carbon use abilities correlate with fungal enzymatic profiles, following principles of the fungal economics spectrum and (iii) carbon use ability is a predictive trait for fungal community functions. Using specialized growth media, we isolated and characterized 105 isolates and developed a novel FungiResp approach that directly tests fungal activity on complex carbon sources. The largest amount of variance between isolates was explained by differential abilities to use cellulose and starch, with only few phylogenetically distinct fungal clades showing high respiratory activity on these biopolymers. A preference for bacterial necromass was another major distinction among taxa. These key traits correlated with soil fungal community shifts in response to carbon substrate availability. By contrast, enzymatic activity was a poor predictor of fungal carbon use ability, except for correlations in lignin use and laccase activity. The newly established functional trait of carbon use ability offers important insights into diverse fungal communities: Many taxa lack the ability to use complex carbon (on their own), while the most common enzymes analyzed in soil showed little correlation with fungal mineralization potential. The discovery of key functional traits is an important step towards predicting the significance of fungal community shifts for soil carbon cycling.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

In this study, we generated 18 new long-read based reference genomes for lichenized fungi, which form obligate mutualistic symbioses with algae or cyanobacteria. We used the new genomes and 10 publically available genomes to investigate the relationships between species traits (i.e., dominant reproductive mode, distribution size, and generation length) and the abundance and spatial distribution of MGEs using a phylogenetic comparative framework. We found that species with smaller distribution sizes and longer generation lengths had a higher genomic DNA transposon load. Specifically, their genomes were enriched with Rolling Circle transposons, which contradicts previous research that has identified high proportions of retrotransposons in rare species. Disproportionate distributions of MGEs in rare and range-restricted species may disrupt genomic stability, decrease fitness, and be reflective of species experiencing a greater degree of stress. Conversely, greater MGE activity may be an important source of novel genetic diversity in isolated populations with limited gene flow. Further research is needed to understand the potential mechanisms driving MGE proliferation in rare species genomes, and if MGE content is predictive of increased extinction risk.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

The strong binding of this RNA fraction to insoluble chromatin impairs its recovery in standard transcriptomic studies. Therefore, the landscape and potential functions of chromatin-associated RNAs are poorly understood. Recent studies indicate that chromatin-associated transcripts can have regulatory roles, particularly during mammalian development. Here we compare the dynamics of cytoplasmic versus chromatin-bound transcriptomes of naive and primed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), as well as fibroblasts. We found a remarkable enrichment for RNA transcribed from alpha satellite repeat (ALR) in the chromatin fraction of naive hESCs, compared to primed hESCs. The co-localization and interaction of ALR RNA with Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1 (PTBP1) protein indicate that ALR RNA foci mark the perinucleolar compartment (PNC), a nuclear sub-compartment previously thought to be exclusive to cancer cells. Knockdown of ALR RNA leads to dispersion of PTBP1 foci, up-regulation of ribosomal RNA and global hypertranscription in naive hESCs. In contrast, loss of PTBP1 does not disturb ALR RNA localization, indicating that ALR is upstream in the hierarchy of organization of the PNC in hESCs. These results reveal a role for ALR RNA in nuclear compartmentalization and tuning rRNA synthesis in naive hESCs. Moreover, this study opens new avenues to dissect the function of ALR RNA and the PNC in cancer contexts.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

We elucidate this in colorectal cancer (CRC) by uncovering a paracrine-to-autocrine shunt of Gremlin1 (GREM1), a canonical stromal-secreted antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). We demonstrate that while GREM1 remains restricted to stromal cells in earlier-stage (I-III) CRC, its ectopic expression in tumor epithelium increases markedly in stage IV. Mechanistically, we identify ACVR1C as a novel, high-affinity epithelial receptor for GREM1. Their interaction activates SMAD2/3 signaling, which upregulates SNAI1 and GREM1, establishing a feedback loop that amplifies epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Disrupting this loop impairs CRC metastasis in vivo. Clinically, epithelial GREM1 or ACVR1C expression predicts metastasis and poor survival.

Through inflammatory cytokine/chemokine array, we identified CCL24, a chemokine ligand for CCR3, as a key immunoregulatory molecule downregulated in both our murine model and sarcoid cohort plasma. Mechanistically, mTORC1 suppresses CCL24 expression via aberrant STAT3 signaling in fibroblasts and promotes CCR3 expression in interstitial macrophages, uncovering a novel regulatory axis in granuloma formation and maintenance. Pharmacological inhibition using rapamycin and azithromycin markedly attenuated granuloma burden and normalized CCL24-CCR3 signaling, underscoring the therapeutic relevance of this axis. Together, our study establishes a mechanistic link between mTORC1 activation, CCL24-CCR3 dysregulation, and granuloma persistence, offering not only a new insight into molecular mechanisms in sarcoidosis but also identifying promising targets for clinical intervention.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

We validated that CpFA are compatible with downstream omics pipelines and thus could be used to determine phenotypic links to relative uptake. Using cpFA, we found that CD4+ regulatory T cells increase arachidonic acid uptake selectively in the intestine. ROR{gamma}t+ Tregs possessed superior Cp-arachidonic acid uptake in the mesenteric lymph node, compared to the small intestine, suggesting cell-intrinsic and niche factors control arachidonic acid uptake.

Both properties are derived from a hypervariable protein placed on the infected cell surface called PfEMP1, different versions of which are encoded by members of the multi-copy var gene family. Over the course of an infection, rising and falling waves of parasitemia correspond to transcriptional switching between var genes, with parasites expressing alternative PfEMP1 isoforms replacing those eliminated by antibodies targeting the previously expressed PfEMP1. var gene expression is controlled epigenetically, however what triggers transcriptional switching and determines which genes are activated is largely unknown. Previous work implicated a unique, universally conserved gene called var2csa as a central component in transcriptional switching, however the molecular basis for its role was obscure. Here we describe how noncoding RNAs, an upstream open reading frame and the nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway interact to enable var2csa to function as a transiently activated switching hub that unifies the var gene family into a single coordinated network, thereby perpetuating chronic infections.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

In this study, the established HIS Rhodobacter sphaeroides HY01, employed for CoQ10 production, was engineered to enhance productivity while ensuring strain stability. Comparative omics identified the PrrAB two-component system as an oxygen-responsive regulator that links CoQ10 biosynthesis to photosynthetic pathways. Mutagenesis of PrrA, guided by AlphaFold3 modeling and fluorescence screening, introduced mutations that led to a 37.5% increase in CoQ10 production. To address phenotypic reversion due to metabolic burden, genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening identified key genes involved in DNA repair and stress adaptation. Deletions of these genes generated a stable strain that achieved 3.6 g/L CoQ10 in a 50-L pilot-scale fed-batch fermentation, surpassing previous reports.

These parasites have selectively retained the Myb domain-containing proteins with homology to chromatin-associated regulators like SNF2H and SWI3. Here, a comprehensive analysis of the Myb protein family in Toxoplasma defines the composition of two SWI3 complexes defined by mutually exclusive ATPases with homology to the widely conserved BRG1 and BRM. Integrating transcriptomics with a custom chromatin-profiling strategy, we show that BRG1 is essential for the timely transcription of genes during mitosis and cytokinesis, while BRM ensures global transcriptional competency and fidelity throughout the cell cycle and developmental transitions.

H.", "abstract": "Membrane transport proteins (transporters) are critical players in the physiology of complex organisms. The range of metabolites a transporter translocates across a membrane (substrate spectra) determines the membrane selectivity and, consequently, the transporter's physiologic function. Nevertheless, determining the full substrate spectra of a transporter, and hence its role(s) in the organism, remains a daunting challenge. Many transporters lack an experimentally determined substrate, and many show a puzzling substrate promiscuity. Substrate promiscuity raises questions about which experimentally defined substrates are physiologic, which are not, and which are missing. Targeted approaches to determine transporter substrate spectra present limitations: Compound availability, lack of unexpected cofactors, and the researchers' biases. To tackle these issues, transporters can be screened with complex native metabolites to generate new hypotheses on their function. Here, we describe an untargeted method to expand and compare the substrate spectra of sets of plant transporters. This method compares the substrate spectra of different transporters when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and exposed to plant metabolic extracts. Comparing the transport-mediated accumulation of metabolites enables us to contextualize the relative transporter activity towards the same set of metabolites from undefined mixtures. Additionally, metabolite accumulation patterns across transporter sets allow us to annotate novel compounds. We validate the method with three well-characterized transporters, where we find unreported substrate spectra specificities and detect the transport of tens of metabolites at a time. We screen a set of fourteen transporters and find unreported activities for eight of them, some of which are confirmed from pure compounds. Finally, we propose to reinterpret the role of two plant transporters previously linked to developmental regulation (phytohormone transport) in light of their substrate promiscuity.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

This study explored how biochar affects the severity of common scab, a globally significant potato disease, through its interactions with soil properties and microbial communities. Two contrasting soils planted with potatoes were amended with fresh biochar and biochar aged within the soils for one and two years. Bulk and tuberosphere soil samples were analyzed for nutrient and micronutrient availability, microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and basal respiration. In sandy soil V, biochar induced immediate but transient shifts in soil chemistry and microbial structure, while in silty soil Z, changes emerged gradually and intensified with biochar aging. These dynamics mirrored the progression of common scab severity, suggesting a strong link between nutrient availability, microbial community shifts, and disease outcomes. The contrasting responses of the two soils were attributed to differences in cation exchange capacity and particle size, which influenced nutrient retention and microbial community structure, including populations of pathogenic Streptomyces. Notably, the exchangeable surface area of soil particles emerged as a factor modulating biochar effects on disease severity. These findings highlight the importance of considering soil texture and microbial composition when applying biochar, emphasizing that site-specific characteristics can critically shape biochars impact on plant health.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

We find that this variant disrupts the activity of a previously unstudied antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located between HOXA7 and HOXA9, which we have named HOTSCRAMBL. The HOTSCRAMBL variant disrupts lncRNA function and reduces human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal. Mechanistically, HOTSCRAMBL enables appropriate expression and splicing of HOXA genes in HSCs, most notably HOXA9, in an SRSF2-dependent manner. Given the critical role of HOXA gene expression in some blood cancers, we also demonstrate that HOTSCRAMBL variation or deletion compromises HOXA-dependent acute myeloid leukemias.

Leveraging this selective targeting of individual promoters within the same gene, we developed isoform-specific single-cell Perturb-Seq to systematically analyse alternative promoter function. Our analysis revealed that alternative promoters in 48.3% of targeted genes drive distinct transcriptional programs. This suggests that promoter selection represents a fundamental mechanism for generating cellular diversity rather than mere transcriptional redundancy. In breast cancer models, this promoter-specific targeting revealed differential effects on drug sensitivity, where distinct estrogen receptor (ESR1) promoters showed opposing influences on tamoxifen response and patient survival.

Here we characterized the silk gland from the pantry moth Plodia interpunctella using a combination of quantitative and spatial assays. RNA-seq analyses of differential gene expression between the MSG and PSG depict the transcriptomic divergence between these two secretory tissues. In the PSG, high expression of fibroin genes FibL and FibH were detected, whereas MSG samples were dominated by transcripts encoding major sericins -- bioadhesive proteins that form the coating of the silk fiber. Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) mRNA profiling revealed sharp cellular boundaries within the silk gland: PSG cells exclusively expressed fibroins, while MSG comprised two compartments each expressing different combinations of sericins. Our findings corroborate the conserved organization of lepidopteran silk glands into specialized secretory subdivisions, and establish Plodia as a promising comparative model for studying silk diversity.

According to this scheme, the higher the evidence level, the greater the level of accuracy. However, it is not yet clear which, apart from direct sensory inputs, are the other factors that potentially impact strategy selection and their corresponding temporal operating windows in invertebrates. Moreover, it is not guaranteed that maximal accuracy could be the only parameter dictating the decision-making process. To address these questions, we employed a visual stimulation paradigm based on the random dot motion kinetogram (RDMk) with varying coherence levels, applied to tethered Drosophila melanogaster. In this scenario, flies tend to turn their heads according to the optic flow's strength and direction. We observed stereotyped head saccadic-like movements across all the RDMk coherence levels, with greater coherence leading to a higher total saccade number and an increased proportion of correct turns. Importantly, logistic regression analysis revealed that, besides sensory inputs, the behavioral outcome and, consequently, the maximal accuracy, are influenced by other factors, in particular the past motor activity.

Here, we used longitudinal brain data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, comprising cortical thickness measures from 180 regions per hemisphere in youths at baseline (N=6179; 47% females), 2-year (N=6179; 47% females), and 4-year (N=805; 45% females) follow-up.

We developed sex-specific Baseline-Integrated Norms (B-Norms) that predict brain region thickness at follow-up based on baseline thickness, baseline age, and follow-up age, and compared them to sex-specific standard Cross-Sectional Norms (C-Norms) based on age alone. Out-of-sample testing in 2-year and 4-year follow-up data showed that B-Norms consistently provided better fits than C-Norms for nearly all cortical regions. Explained variance was higher in B-Norms than in C-Norms. We found no significant differences between time points (p = 0.45). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed differences in higher-order moments (e.g., skewness and kurtosis) for both models; for example, skewness varied by model, sex, time point, and their interactions.

Following apoplastic entry, P. syringae uses its type 3 injectisome (T3I) to secrete host-specific effectors into the cytoplasm, enabling tissue wetting and immune suppression and leading to bacterial proliferation, chlorosis and necrosis. P. syringae strains encode dozens of highly specialised effectors, whose composition defines strain specificity and host range. Effective plant infection depends on the tight temporal and hierarchical control of effector delivery through the T3I. Effector secretion is driven by HrcN, an ATPase complex that interacts with the base of the T3I and is essential for plant infection. HrcN binds specifically to the bacterial signalling molecule cyclic-di-GMP, although the impact of binding on T3I function and P. syringae virulence is currently unknown. To address this, we examined the influence of mutating the predicted cyclic-di-GMP-hrcN binding site on plant infection and effector secretion. Despite maintaining effective bacterial proliferation in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, two hrcN mutants showed severely compromised disease symptoms, a phenotype linked to reduced translocation of a specific subset of T3I-effectors, with HopAA1-2 particularly important for symptom development.

Here, we present the first comprehensive population genomics study of Ghaf, based on whole-genome re-sequencing of 204 individual trees collected across the UAE. Following Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) discovery and stringent filtering, we analyzed 57,183 high-quality LD-pruned SNPs to assess population structure, diversity, and gene flow.

Genetic diversity varied significantly among groups, with observed heterozygosity (Ho), inbreeding coefficients (F), and nucleotide diversity ({pi}) showing strong population-specific trends. Genome-wide Fixation index FST scans identified multiple highly differentiated genomic regions, enriched for genes involved in stress response, transport, and signaling.

P.; Mertens, J.; Zamora-Ceballos, M.; Martinez-Romero, J. M.; Fontana, J.; Carrascosa, J. L.; Barcena, J.; Caston, J. R.", "abstract": "Caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens that cause varying clinical signs including gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, and hepatitis. Despite the availability of numerous calicivirus structures, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of capsid assembly and stability, or about genome packaging. Here we present the atomic structure of the RHDV virion and several related non-infectious virus-like particles, determined using cryo-EM at 2.5-3.3 [A] resolution. The inherent molecular switch, responsible for the conformational flexibility of the capsid protein VP1, is located in its N-terminal arm (NTA). The NTA establishes an extensive network of interactions on the inner capsid surface that stabilizes the hexamers and pentamers. For this structural polymorphism, we show that the NTA must interact with the RNA viral genome, that is, the genomic RNA acts concomitantly with the NTA as a molecular switch. The NTA-RNA interaction leads to specific conformational states that result in two types of VP1 dimers (the basic building blocks) necessary for T=3 capsid assembly. In addition, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to assess whether differences in genomic RNA content influence viral properties such as capsid stiffness in physiological conditions. These analyses highlight the mechanical role of packed RNA genome in RHDV virions, as the virion capsid pentamers are strengthened by interactions of the NTA star-like structure promoted by the viral genome. These results indicate that the interactions between the NTA and the viral genome guide the conformational states of VP1 dimers, directing capsid assembly and modulating its mechanical properties. Through interference with intermediate assemblies, the NTA network promoted by the genome could be an attractive target in future antiviral strategies.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

S.; Nita, E.; Gabrhelikova, Z.; Curran, O. E.; Brennan, P. M.; Singh, A.; Ball, K. L.", "abstract": "The IFITM1 protein is a key component of the Interferon-Stimulated Gene (ISG) network, which has been linked to treatment-resistant signatures in various cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM). Despite its impact, the mechanisms underlying IFITM1's role in cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial dynamics of IFITM1 localisation are highly context-dependent, particularly in GBM tissue. In the vasculature, IFITM1 is predominantly localised to the plasma membrane of endothelial cells. However, when present in a subset of cancer stem cells, IFITM1 adopts a distinct perinuclear location, where it co-localises with IFITM3 and is notably absent from the membrane. The spatial dynamics of IFITM1 localisation was investigated in patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs), primary endothelial cells and engineered cell lines. Endogenous IFITM1 localised primarily to assemblies in the perinuclear space, however loss of functional IFITM3 led to a shift in the distribution of the protein to a predominantly membrane location. In contrast, IFITM3 localisation was unaffected by the loss of IFITM1. The results were recapitulated by transient expression of IFITM1 or -3 into double knockout (DKO) GSCs and by using an engineered system where IFITM1 expression was IFN-independent. Co-expression studies demonstrate that IFITM3 is sufficient to localise IFITM1 to vesicle structures in the perinuclear space and that mutant forms of IFITM3 lead to retention of IFITM1 primarily at the plasma membrane. Our data highlights dynamic changes in the subcellular localisation of IFITM1 suggesting that distinct functions of this resistance factor may present a specific target for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

However, its broad adoption has been constrained by the lack of open-source end-to-end workflows in a community-driven ecosystem. Here, we introduce openDVP, an experimental and computational framework for simplifying and democratizing DVP. OpenDVP integrates open-source software for image analysis, including MCMICRO, QuPath, and Napari, and uses scverse data formats AnnData and SpatialData for multi-omics integration. It offers two workflows: a fast-track pipeline requiring no image analysis expertise and an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered pipeline with recent algorithms for image pre-processing, segmentation, and spatial analysis. We demonstrate openDVP's versatility in three archival tissue studies, profiling human placenta, early-stage lung cancer, and locally relapsed breast cancer. Our framework provided insights into health and disease states by connecting spatial single-cell phenotypes with exploratory proteomic data. Finally, we introduce deep proteomic profiling of cellular neighborhoods as a scalable approach to accelerate spatial discovery proteomics across biological systems.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "We investigated O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a post-translational modification (PTM), in an in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and aging. Employing a chemoenzymatic labeling strategy combined with an automated image processing, we analyzed both post-hatching and adult stages of wild-type (WT, N2) and transgenic strain expressing human tau V337M under the aex-3 promoter (aex-3p::tau(V337M)). Nematodes were incubated with an azido-modified N-acetylglucosamine analog, followed by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with an alkyne-conjugated dye. Labeled O-GlcNAc proteins were visualized via fluorescence microscopy and quantified using a region-of-interest (ROI)-based image analysis pipeline. Morphometric characterization revealed an age-dependent increase in O-GlcNAcylation in WT worms, whereas the AD model showed a progressive decline. O-GlcNAc-labeled ROIs exhibited a shift from anterograde to predominantly retrograde transport in middle-aged worms, suggesting that aging and neurodegeneration alter O-GlcNAc trafficking dynamics, potentially reflecting impaired synaptic support or enhanced clearance in C. elegans.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}

However, most source reconstruction software is limited to 3-4 nested layers of low resolution and a small number of dipolar sources ~10,000. Recently, we introduced modeling techniques for source econstruction of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals using the reciprocal approach and the boundary element fast multipole method (BEM-FMM). The technique of BEM-FMM can process both nested and non-nested models with as many as 4 million surface elements. In this paper, we present an analogue technique for source reconstruction of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals based on cortical global basis functions. The present work uses Helmholtz reciprocity to relate the reciprocally-generated lead-field matrices to their direct counterpart, while resolving the issue of possible biases toward the reference electrode. Our methodology is tested with experimental EEG data collected from a cohort of 12, young and healthy, volunteers subjected to intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). Our novel high-resolution source reconstruction models can have impact on mental health screening as well as brain-computer inter- faces.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Stress granule component TIA-1 is a specific negative regulator of the non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome.", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.12.634801", "authors": "Lamichhane, P. P.; Aditi, A.; Neil, B. H.; Kilgore, P.; Torres, A.; Chopra, A. K.; Samir, P.", "abstract": "Inflammasomes are cytosolic signaling hubs assembled upon pathogen- or damage associated molecular patterns (PAMP and DAMP) sensing by innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRR). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present on the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria is a PAMP that activates caspase 11 (CASP11) dependent nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome (known as non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome) leading to pyroptosis. Several host factors are shown to promote non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation by making LPS readily available for recognition by CASP11. Here, we report T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1), an RNA binding protein as a negative regulator of non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome. Using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), we demonstrated that the loss of TIA1 led to an increase in caspase-1 (CASP1) activity in response to cytosolic LPS. A previous study had demonstrated that mice lacking Tia1 are more susceptible to LPS mediated endotoxic shock. Our results provide a potential explanation for this observation by showing loss of TIA1 increases non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation resulting in increased inflammation and pathogenesis during LPS mediated endotoxic shock. Further, TIA1 mediated inhibition of non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome is independent of TIA1's regulatory role in gene transcription as well as its role in stress granule assembly. TIA1 is also dispensable for activation of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome as well as AIM2 and NLRC4 inflammasomes. While, the exact mechanism by which TIA1 inhibits non-canonical inflammasome activation remains to be elucidated, our finding that TIA1 is a negative regulator indicates the presence of undiscovered regulatory mechanisms. Future studies will focus on unraveling these mechanisms for developing anti-inflammatory drugs that exploit non-canonical inflammasome activity modulation.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": ""}
