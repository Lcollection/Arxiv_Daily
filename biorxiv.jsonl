In response to pressure overload elicited by transverse aortic constriction, we observed nuclear translocation of GAPDH in the mouse heart. We also demonstrated a robust nuclear localization of GAPDH in cardiomyocytes from patients with dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whereas negligible GAPDH in the nucleus in control subjects. This is the first demonstration of disease-associated nuclear GAPDH directly in living patients. Using immunohistochemical methods and a pharmacological way that selectively blocks GAPDH nuclear translocation (RR compound), we proved the causal involvement of GAPDH cysteine-150 modification in this translocation in Gq-induced cell model for heart hypertrophy. Accordingly, both pharmacological and genetic interventions proved that the same mechanism played a causal role for heart hypertrophy and dysfunction in vivo. We discovered that, upon nuclear translocation, GAPDH augmented the protein interaction of BRG1 and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), which further facilitated the Myh7/Myh6 isoform ratio from the mature to immature status, an essential mechanism for heart hypertrophy. Beyond medical implications, we provide a novel mechanism of stress-induced reversion of a cellular phenotype from adult to fetal state, which is mediated by a \"moonlighting\" function of GAPDH.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

We developed ClockBase Agent (www.clockbase.org), a publicly accessible platform that reanalyzes millions of human and mouse methylation and RNA-seq samples by integrating them with over 40 aging clock predictions. ClockBase Agent employs specialized AI agents that autonomously generate aging-focused hypotheses, evaluate intervention effects on biological age, conduct literature reviews, and produce scientific reports across all datasets. Reanalyzing 43,602 intervention-control comparisons through multiple aging biomarkers revealed thousands of age-modifying effects missed by original investigators, including over 500 interventions that significantly reduce biological age (e.g., ouabain, KMO inhibitor, fenofibrate, and NF1 knockout). Large-scale systematic analysis reveals fundamental patterns: significantly more interventions accelerate rather than decelerate aging, disease states predominantly accelerate biological age, and loss-of-function genetic approaches systematically outperform gain-of-function strategies in decelerating aging. As validation, we show that identified interventions converge on canonical longevity pathways and with strong concordance to independent lifespan databases. We further experimentally validated ouabain, a top-scoring AI-identified candidate, demonstrating reduced frailty progression, decreased neuroinflammation, and improved cardiac function in aged mice. ClockBase Agent establishes a paradigm where specialized AI agents systematically reanalyze all prior research to identify age-modifying interventions autonomously, transforming how we extract biological insights from existing data to advance human healthspan and longevity.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

This LssaCA-NP complex interacts with a rice thaumatin-like protein (OsTLP) that possess endo-{beta}-1,3-glucanase activity potentially degrading callose. Upon binding, the LssaCA-NP complex significantly enhances OsTLP enzymatic activity. We further clarify that both L. striatellus feeding and RSV infection induce callose deposition.

In this context, performing global signal regression (GSR) as a preprocessing step remains controversial.

Here, we address this question by examining the fundamental sources of resting global signal fluctuations using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI data combined with cardiac and breathing recordings. Our results suggest that systemic physiological fluctuations account for a significantly larger fraction of global signal variability compared to electrophysiological fluctuations. Furthermore, we show that GSR reduces artifactual connectivity due to heart rate and breathing fluctuations, but preserves connectivity patterns associated with electrophysiological activity within the alpha and beta frequency ranges.

However, the ecology of many bat species is still unknown, especially in poorly sampled regions such as Central Africa. Aims: We present the first application of an acoustic method for studying the nocturnal activity patterns and annual phenology of bat activity of cave bat communities in regions where no bat acoustic classifier exists. Methods: In two caves (Mont Belo and Boundou) in the Republic of Congo, which are home to several species of insectivorous bats throughout the year, we set up a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) over a period of 19 months. To identify the massive recordings collected, we used a sonotype classifier. To assign a species name or species group to the different sonotypes identified by the classifier, we collected local reference calls by capturing bats at the cave entrances. This enabled us to identify two bat groups and three species despite the absence of local call libraries. The capture sessions also allowed us to collect information about the biological status of the individuals, which we put in perspective with the annual phenology of activity. To quantify bat activity, we defined the activity of each acoustic group as the number of bat passes, where a bat pass corresponds to the detection of one or several echolocation calls within a five-second interval. This standardized measure allowed us to quantify nightly and seasonal variations in activity. Key results: The nightly activity displayed strong peaks in the evening and the morning, except during the long rainy season, when a tri- or quadri-modal activity was detected. This more evenly distributed activity throughout the night is related to the period of juvenile rearing (gestation, parturition and lactation). For all acoustic groups, we also observed a higher activity during the rainy seasons and the short dry season, compared to the long dry season. This high activity is linked to the lactation period, the independence of young bats and potentially the mating period. Finally, the reproductive activity of insectivorous bat species is synchronized with the period of high resource availability. Conclusion : This study represents the first long-term acoustic monitoring of cave bats in the Republic of Congo. This was allowed by the use of a classifier built without any pre-existing regional call data, highlighting a practical pathway for studying bat activity in other data-deficient regions. Implications : Information about the biological status of individuals captured at the monitored caves in association with the cave annual activity phenology produced with this new method are key to progress in the understanding of the ecology and the conservation issues of cave bat communities, which are particularly threatened globally.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Biol., 2019] is a highly effective heuristic for computing text indexes for very large amounts of biological data. The algorithm constructs a data structure, the prefix-free parse (PFP) of the input, consisting of a dictionary and a parse, which is then used to speed up computation of the final index. In this paper, we study the size of the PFP, which we refer to as {pi}, and show that it is a powerful tool in its own right. To show this, we present two use cases. We first study the application of {pi} as a repetitiveness measure of the input text, and compare it to other currently used repetitiveness measures, including z (the number of Lempel-Ziv phrases), r (the number of runs of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform), and {delta} (the text's substring complexity). We then turn to the use of {pi} as a measure for pangenome openness. In both applications, our results are similar to existing measures, but our tool, in almost all cases, is more efficient than those computing the other measures, both in terms of time and space, sometimes by an order of magnitude. We close the paper with a detailed systematic study of the parameter choice for PFP (window size w and modulus p). This gives rise to interesting open questions.

A key question is whether the thermodynamic driving forces underlying reversible phase separation and maturation to irreversible amyloids are distinct and separable. Here, we address this question using an engineered version of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, which forms biochemically active condensates. Liquid-like Tau condensates exhibit rapid aging to amyloid fibrils under quiescent, cofactor-free conditions. In particular, the Tau condensate interface promotes fibril nucleation, thereby impairing condensate activity in recruiting tubulin and catalyzing microtubule assembly. Remarkably, a small molecule metabolite, L-arginine, selectively impedes condensate-to-fibril transition without perturbing phase separation in a valence and chemistry-specific manner. By enhancing condensate viscoelasticity, L-arginine counteracts age-dependent decline in the biochemical activity of Tau condensates. These results provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that small molecule metabolites can reinforce the metastability of protein condensates against a liquid-to-amyloid transition, thereby preserving condensate function.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

We estimate the heterogeneous distribution of latent period and burst size using a nonlinear model of infection dynamics applied to population-scale time series data. We then validate our inference approach using a single-cell assay -- demonstrating the feasibility of inferring phage trait heterogeneity from population data even in the absence of single-cell experiments. The variation in Syn9's latent period exceeds that previously found in coliphages, highlighting the limitations of representing traits with a single value. Moreover, by partitioning lytic events via the inferred heterogeneous latent period distribution, we show that realized burst size variability is largely explained by differences in latent period, providing a path forward to measure and integrate trait (co)variation into population and ecosystem models.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

HIV entrance into host cells depends on the C-C chemokine receptor type-5 (CCR5) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 (CXCR4), which makes them potential targets for antiviral medication development. The objective of this study is to computationally evaluate 53 phytochemicals that target the C-C chemokine receptor type-5 (CCR5) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 (CXCR4) as potential anti-HIV medications. Effective anti-HIV medications were projected to be phytochemicals that may inhibit these receptors and so interfere with the HIV life cycle. AutoDock Vina was used to perform the molecular docking investigation from which six phytochemicals capable of inhibiting CCR5 and CXCR4 were identified based on the lowest docking score. The SWISSADME server was utilized to decide the druglikeness properties of these phytochemicals, the ADMETlab server to predict different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, the PASS-Way2Drug server to evaluate their activity spectra, and the RS-WebPredictor server to figure out the metabolism in the body. The six phytochemicals that were capable of suppressing CCR5 and CXCR4 were Withaferin A, Oleanolic Acid, Ursolic Acid, Theaflavine, Camptothecin, and Hypericin. The acceptable docking scores for these phytochemicals were less than -8.8 kcal/mol. They also adhered to Lipinski's rule of five and had promising ADME/toxicity study results, indicating their drug-likeness properties. Also, these compounds produced strong likelihood ratings (around 1.0) in activity spectra analysis and site of metabolism prediction, demonstrating their potency as powerful bioactive agents. Additionally, the molecules were exposed to sophisticated molecular dynamics simulation to assess their binding properties under a simulated physiological environment. Their performance in this investigation was efficient compared to the positive controls.

Design: Cohort study with non-contact controls and stratification of contact athletes by head-impact exposure. Method: Twenty-two male varsity football players and 27 non-contact controls underwent pre-season diffusion tensor imaging. Tract-specific fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were derived from commissural and association tracts using probabilistic tractography. Helmet-mounted accelerometers quantified head-impact frequency and gForce over the season, classifying athletes into high (HE) and low-exposure (LE) groups. Football players completed the Kinarm Ball-on-Bar bimanual coordination task and SCAT3 symptom checklist pre- and post-season. Results: At pre-season, contact athletes showed altered white matter microstructure versus controls, with higher FA and predominantly lower MD across most tracts. Over the season, HE athletes sustained more total impacts and gForce than LE athletes and showed declining bimanual coordination on the Ball-on-Bar motor task. SCAT3 symptom and severity scores were low and showed no differences in change. Conclusions: Repetitive subconcussive exposure in collegiate football is associated with persisting white matter differences and subtle bimanual motor coordination deficits that are not detected by routine symptom-based tools, supporting the use of advanced neuroimaging and robotic motor assessment to monitor athlete brain health.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Our results reveal individuals with hybrid ancestry roughly in proportion to the frequency of individuals of intermediate phenotype recorded in the wild. Individuals with hybrid ancestry were predominantly those with intermediate morphologies, but morphologically-intermediate individuals were not always of hybrid origin, which raises alternative possibilities for the origin and maintenance of color variation in the system. Genomic regions differentiated between species are largely located on the Z chromosome, and we find more candidates on autosomes than in another Colias contact zone.

In this study, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout and stem Leydig cells (SLCs) transplantation, we identified a critical Dhh/Patched 2 (Ptch2)/Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1)/steroidogenic factor 1 (Sf1) signaling axis essential for SLC differentiation in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Dhh deficiency resulted in defective adult Leydig cells and androgen insufficiency. Rescue experiments involving 11-ketotestosterone administration and a Dhh agonist treatment, combined with SLCs transplantation, demonstrated that Dhh regulates SLC differentiation, not survival. In vitro knockout of ptch1 and ptch2 in SLCs revealed that Ptch2 likely acts as the functional receptor for Dhh. This was further supported by in vivo genetic rescue experiments, where ptch2 mutation did not impair testicular development, yet completely rescued the testicular defects in dhh mutants consistent with Ptch2 acting as an inhibitory receptor whose loss alleviates Dhh pathway suppression. Luciferase assays in Gli-knockout SLCs demonstrated that Gli1 acts as the primary transcriptional effector, and transactivates sf1 expression. Additionally, functional transplantation assays confirmed that Sf1 is indispensable for SLCs differentiation, as Sf1-overexpressing SLCs rescued differentiation, whereas sf1-mutant SLCs failed.

They develop as B cell receptors (BCRs): membrane-bound forms of antibodies that are expressed on the surfaces of B cells. BCRs are refined through affinity maturation, a process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and natural selection, to improve binding to an antigen. Computational models of affinity maturation have developed from two main perspectives: molecular evolution and language modeling. The molecular evolution perspective focuses on nucleotide sequence context to describe mutation and selection; the language modeling perspective involves learning patterns from large data sets of protein sequences. In this paper, we compared models from both perspectives on their ability to predict the course of antibody affinity maturation along phylogenetic trees of BCR sequences. This included models of SHM, models of SHM combined with an estimate of selection, and protein language models. We evaluated these models for large human BCR repertoire data sets, as well as an antigen-specific mouse experiment with a pre-rearranged cognate naive antibody. We demonstrated that precise modeling of SHM, which requires the nucleotide context, provides a substantial amount of predictive power for predicting the course of affinity maturation. Notably, a simple nucleotide-based convolutional neural network modeling SHM outperformed state-of-the-art protein language models, including one trained exclusively on antibody sequences. Furthermore, incorporating estimates of selection based on a custom deep mutational scanning experiment brought only modest improvement in predictive power. To support further research, we introduce EPAM (Evaluating Predictions of Affinity Maturation), a benchmarking framework to integrate evolutionary principles with advances in language modeling, offering a road map for understanding antibody evolution and improving predictive models.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Such intraspecific genetic and phenotypic variation makes a substantial contribution to biological diversity. Building on established results from invasion analysis, we analyse conditions under which adaptive polymorphism can emerge under long-term gradual evolution. We first note that, in general, fully characterising an adaptive polymorphism, including its number of morphs, trait values and frequencies, is a computationally hard problem. Nevertheless, standard invasion results reveal a unifying necessary condition for the gradual emergence of polymorphism: negative trait-dependent selection (NTDS), whereby population-level expression of a trait decreases selection acting on that same trait. We use NTDS as an organising principle to structure the pathways through which polymorphism can evolve. This is based on a decomposition of individual fitness that distinguishes production factors, the inputs to survival and reproduction that are endogenous to individuals, from regulating factors, the ecological, social or genetic inputs to fitness that are influenced in part by conspecifics. This decomposition allows us to clarify how NTDS arises across three broad classes of interactions -- ecological, social and genetic -- and to identify previously unrecognised adaptive polymorphisms in well-studied scenarios, including life-history, social preferences, and class-structured populations. More broadly, by integrating perspectives from population genetics, evolutionary ecology, adaptive dynamics, game theory and inclusive fitness theory, we aim to provide a common thread among the pathways through which selection favours intraspecific variation.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

In spatially resolved transcriptomics, delineating higher-order anatomical structures is critical for understanding how cellular organization affects tissue and organ function. Since 2020, more than 50 spatially aware clustering (SAC) methods have been developed for this purpose. However, the reliability of current benchmarks is undermined by their narrow focus on Visium and brain tissue datasets, as well as incorrect interpretation of manual annotation as ground truth. Here, we present SACCELERATOR, a community-driven, extensible framework that standardizes data formatting, method integration, and metric evaluation, and is designed to rapidly incorporate new methods and datasets. SACCELERATOR currently includes 22 SAC methods applied to 15 datasets spanning 9 technologies and diverse tissue types. Our analysis revealed substantial limitations in the generalizability and reproducibility of SAC methods across tissues and platforms. We also demonstrate that anatomical labels commonly used as ground truths are often biased, potentially error-prone, and, in some cases, unsuitable for benchmarking efforts. Rather than scoring and comparing methods, we propose a consensus-guided workflow that aggregates clustering results to generate consensus representations. Descriptive spatial metrics highlight areas of high entropy where method disagreement is highest, enabling targeted feedback for tissue experts. Applied to brain and cancer datasets, this approach uncovered biologically meaningful patterns overlooked by individual methods and manual annotations. Our results underscore the need for iterative, expert-in-the-loop analysis and reveal that traditional evaluation metrics do not always capture the subjective qualities of results.

Functional characterisation of recognised Avr effectors of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) lags other key fungal pathogens of wheat. Here, we used a wheat protoplast-based screen to identify Avr/R interactions via the proxy of effector-induced defence responses in a set of diverse wheat cultivars. We identified an Avr candidate, termed AvrPstB48, that triggers defence responses in 16 out of 24 cultivars tested. AvrPstB48 is hemizygous, and the Pst genome carries four divergent paralogs within a gene cluster. Analysis of these paralogs revealed partial redundancy in their ability to activate wheat defences and enabled us to identify a single amino acid in AvrPstB48 that is necessary but not sufficient for defence activation. Notably, the activation of defence signalling by AvrPstB48 in protoplasts did not directly correlate with disease outcomes. Whole-plant infection assays revealed that some cultivars which exhibited strong defence activation in the protoplast assay are susceptible to the Pst isolate Pst104E137A- from which AvrPstB48 is derived. Comparison of infection dynamics of two wheat cultivars that differ in their AvrPstB48 recognition capacity revealed a delay in disease progression in the recognising cultivar Avocet S compared to the non-recognising cultivar Morocco. While correlative only, our observations, combined with other recent reports, support a recognize-then-suppress model of plant-pathogen interaction where disease outcomes are driven not only by simple Avr/R interactions but also by pathogen effectors that suppress defence signalling downstream of effector recognition.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

The chromatin remodeller CHD4 has been shown to be capable of sliding nucleosomes in vitro, and to regulate chromatin accessibility and gene expression in vivo. Using an inducible depletion system, here we identify a second mechanism of action for CHD4 in actively restricting the residence time of transcription factors on chromatin. Together these activities result in distinct, context-dependent outcomes: at highly accessible regulatory elements, CHD4 limits transcription factor binding to maintain regulatory function, while at low-accessibility euchromatic regions, it prevents transcription factor engagement and sustains chromatin compaction, thereby silencing cryptic enhancers. Collectively, these mechanisms enable CHD4 to reduce transcriptional noise while preserving the responsiveness of active regulatory networks.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that the transcription elongation factor Spt5 determines elongation complex composition to promote productive elongation and the transition to termination. Using an unbiased genetic screen and genomic approaches in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we provide evidence that dephosphorylation of the Spt5 C-terminal repeat domain (CTR) by Glc7/PP1 is required to dislodge the Paf1 complex (Paf1C) from RNAPII near the cleavage and polyadenylation site (CPS). Mutations in Paf1C or the Spt5 CTR that dissociate Paf1C from RNAPII bypass the requirement for two critical regulators of Glc7 in the cleavage and polyadenylation factor that promote Glc7 enrichment at the ends of genes. Depletion of Glc7 causes aberrant retention of Paf1C past the CPS and a dramatic increase in readthrough transcription, which is fully suppressed by Paf1C mutations. Our results demonstrate that Paf1C retention antagonizes transcription termination and that Glc7-mediated restructuring of the RNAPII elongation complex to evict Paf1C at the CPS is a critical step in the transition from elongation to termination.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

While the effects of dietary protein content and macronutrient ratios are well described, the metabolic costs of providing an imbalanced essential amino acid (EAA) supply in dietary proteins remain poorly understood. We examined how dietary EAA imbalance affects growth, metabolism, and energy allocation in BSFL. Larvae were reared on a reference diet (chicken feed) and three isonitrogenous, semi-synthetic diets: one balanced diet matching the EAA profile of the reference, and two unbalanced diets selectively deficient in either leucine, phenylalanine, and threonine or isoleucine, lysine, and tryptophan. Using open flow respirometry, daily growth monitoring, and biochemical analysis, we quantified gas exchange, body composition, and the energetic costs of biomass and protein deposition. EAA imbalance delayed development, reduced growth and protein content, and promoted lipid accumulation, while O2 consumption and CO2 production were reduced and respiratory exchange ratios exceeded 1.0, indicating elevated lipogenesis. Metabolic costs per unit protein deposited were higher on EAA-deficient diets (up to 3.63 kJ per kJ protein), reflecting inefficient amino acid utilisation. In contrast, the balanced diet supported more efficient protein deposition at a lower energetic cost (2.73 kJ per kJ protein). Our findings demonstrate that suboptimal dietary EAA profiles reduce metabolic efficiency in BSFL.

Using long-term demographic, behavioral, and physiological data for 2,100 females from a non-human primate population, we tested whether naturally-occurring ELA influences investment in the competing physiological demands of growth and reproduction. By analyzing ELA, growth, and reproduction in the same individuals, we also assessed whether adversity intensifies trade-offs between life history domains. We found that ELA influenced life history patterns, and was associated with modified growth, delayed reproductive maturity, and small adult body size. Different types of ELA sometimes had distinct reproductive outcomes - e.g., large group size was linked to faster reproductive rates, while low maternal rank predicted slower ones. Adversity also amplified trade-offs between growth and reproduction: small body size was a stronger predictor of delayed and reduced reproductive output in females exposed to ELA, compared to those not exposed. Finally, we examined how traits modified by ELA related to lifetime reproductive success. Across the population, starting reproduction earlier and maintaining a moderate reproductive rate conferred the greatest number of offspring surviving to reproductive maturity. These findings suggest that ELA impacts key life history traits as well as relationships between them, and can constrain individuals from adopting the most optimal reproductive strategy.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

To bridge this gap, we present a miniaturized and simplified chip-based platform that combines three components into a single diagnostic pipeline: we use (i) spectrally distinct silver and gold nanoparticles that form analyte-dependent clusters with unique spectral fingerprints, (ii) a one-pot, enzyme- and purification-free assay on a chip integrated with a high-throughput automated low-cost microscope, and (iii) a morphology-guided convolutional Graph Neural Network that embeds morphology information into convolutional kernels and performs graph-based relational learning across particle-level features.

The current gold standard catalogues are those released by the WHO but the underlying data are not fully released and they are difficult to interpret. Open and reproducible methods would help address these problems, extending the important work already done. Methods: We have developed an automated method, catomatic, that uses a binomial test to associate informative isolates with resistance or susceptibility, and built a catalogue (catomatic-1) from the same 39,358 samples used to construct the first edition of the WHO catalogue (WHOv1). We performed a sensitivity analysis to optimise statistical and bioinformatic parameters for each drug, and benchmarked catomatic-1 against WHOv1 using an independent Validation Dataset of 14,380 isolates. Findings: By using simpler statistics, catomatic-1 algorithmically classified 1,329 genetic variants, ranging from five for linezolid to 440 for pyrazinamide. WHOv1 included generalisable rules added by a panel of experts, increasing its predictive coverage, but at the cost of reproducibility. Despite not including such expert rules, catomatic-1 achieves comparable performance for all drugs, with sensitivities for first-line agents above 88% on the independent Validation Dataset. The automated process allowed us to efficiently explore parameter space; for instance, detecting resistant variants with low read support improved the sensitivity for all drugs. Interpretation: Performant resistance catalogues for M. tuberculosis can be built automatically using transparent and reproducible statistical methods. As more data are collected, catalogue content and performance will evolve, highlighting the need for proper versioning, machine/human readability, and open access. This approach demonstrates resistance catalogues used in surveillance and diagnostics can be rapidly and reproducibily updated.

Yet it remains unclear whether these influences arise from a single mechanism or reflect functionally distinct processes operating over different timescales. Across two experiments, we embedded a perceptual estimation task during the delay interval of a WM task and tracked continuous mouse trajectories during both perceptual matching and subsequent WM tests. Hierarchical Bayesian mixture modeling revealed robust bidirectional attraction between memory and perception. Time-resolved analyses of mouse trajectories further revealed two distinct components: an early, endpoint-inconsistent deviation that varied with movement onset latency, whereas a slower, endpoint-consistent drift that closely tracked biases in the final report. This pattern is consistent with a fast, capture-like influence of the WM template, and a sustained bias in the evolving decision, respectively. Notably, the prospective influence of WM on perception expressed both early deviation and sustained drift, whereas the retrospective influence of perception on WM primarily involved the sustained component. These findings indicate that WM shapes perceptual decisions through at least two temporally distinct contributions, and illustrate how continuous trajectories can reveal the dynamic structure of top-down influences within single trials.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Although fibrocytes were identified in early descriptive studies across several mammalian systems, most of this work predated modern molecular approaches, and the cells remain incompletely defined at the molecular level and have not previously been derived or characterized in cattle. Seeking somatic cells that could be collected aseptically and reproducibly under field conditions for reprogramming to pluripotency, we recognized fibrocytes as a practical and previously unexplored candidate population. Here, we establish a reproducible method for fibrocyte derivation and expansion from adult bovine blood and define their molecular identity using transcriptomic and network analyses. Principal component and differential expression analyses revealed extensive immune, inflammatory, metabolic, and stress-responsive pathways that distinguished fibrocytes from fibroblasts. Upstream regulator analysis identified a fibrocyte-restricted transcriptional network governed by SPI1, IRF5/IRF7, NFKBIZ, PRDM1, CIITA, and MAFB, supporting a monocyte-derived origin and indicating some retention of hematopoietic lineage memory despite acquisition of mesenchymal features. Optimized fibrocyte medium (FbC; dexamethasone, ascorbate, PDGF-BB, EGF, A83-01, CHIR99021) supported stable proliferation and selectively enhanced cytoskeletal and matrix-constructive programs while attenuating inflammatory tone. When reprogrammed with polycistronic OCT4-SOX2-KLF4-cMYC and SV40 large T antigen, fibrocytes generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) colonies exhibiting defining molecular and morphological features of pluripotency.

We formalize three tasks: patch, border, and niche, predicting responses in nearby unperturbed regions, at tissue interfaces, and as a function of surrounding microenvironments. We evaluate CONCERT on Perturb-map lung datasets. CONCERT outperforms state-of-the-art models (dissociated counterfactuals, spatialized perturbation models, and kNN), reducing E-distance by up to 33.77% (patch), 26.05% (border), and 33.74% (niche) versus the next best, with mean absolute error down by up to 23.28% and Pearson correlation up by up to 9.10%. Two case studies go beyond benchmarking. In dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, CONCERT reconstructs spatial gene expression at unmeasured time points, produces longitudinal comparisons across unpaired mice, resolves inter-mouse heterogeneity, and recovers consistent temporal declines of inflammation-associated genes across regions.

Current sequence-based models, such as Enformer and Borzoi, trained exclusively on the reference genome, cannot capture the effects of individual-specific regulatory variants. Moreover, the acquisition of paired whole-genome and transcriptome data required for personalized modeling is hindered by privacy and data-sharing constraints. To address this limitation, we integrate genomic data synthesis with established statistical frameworks. Our approach generates thousands of synthetic training samples by simulating genetic variation from the 1000 Genomes Project and assigning pseudo-expression labels using PrediXcan, a validated eQTL-based predictor. Because simulated and real expression values differ in scale and distribution, we introduce a preference-based objective that models relative rather than absolute expression patterns. Fine-tuning Enformer through alternating cycles of real-data regression and synthetic-data preference optimization enables efficient learning from both real and synthesized data. Using the GEUVADIS dataset, our framework outperforms AlphaGenome, PrediXcan, and Enformer fine-tuned without synthesized data, demonstrating that simulation-based integration of population-level regulatory knowledge can effectively mitigate data scarcity and improve cross-individual generalization in sequence-based gene expression prediction.

Here we investigated, for the first time, the role of the most abundant mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of alcohol drinking and alcohol mediated gene expression. The fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) plays a key role in erasing m6A RNA methylation marks. We generated brain m6A hypermethylated mice with selective deletion of FTO in neurons by crossing FTO-floxed mice (FTO-fl/fl) with the synapsin-1-CRE deleter line (Syn1-CRE). Neuronal FTO-deficient mice showed enhanced initial motivation for alcohol, achieved escalated (dependent) drinking more rapidly after repeated cycles of alcohol intoxication and were more susceptible to relapse to heavy drinking following a period of abstinence. Alcohol-naive neuronal FTO-deficient mice exhibited potentiated alcohol-induced anxiolytic and sedative effects and blunted anxiogenic responses, despite unaltered alcohol metabolism. We carried out RNA-Seq of enriched methylated RNA by immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and RNA-Seq profiling of unenriched RNA to study alcohols effect on the epitranscriptomic and transcriptional landscape. We observed that a history of alcohol intoxication induces robust RNA m6A hypermethylation in the hippocampus and that FTO-deficiency markedly alters m6A methylation and transcriptional dynamics. GSEA pathway analysis showed that neuronal FTO deficiency induces addiction-relevant pathways and alters monoaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, providing a molecular basis for the heightened vulnerability to alcohol abuse. Our findings demonstrate that neuronal m6A RNA methylation is a novel regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and alcohol-dependent gene expression and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis AUD.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Building on previous work in which DNA-barcoded probes were developed for the multiplexed detection of biomarkers, this study explores different analytical approaches for interpreting binary nanopore signals. The method relies on identifying two classes of events: (1) non-delayed signals, indicating the absence of a target biomarker, and (2) delayed signals, resulting from probe-target interactions, proving the presence of the biomarker. To classify these events and enable robust biomarker detection, we applied three different computational strategies: (1) moving standard deviation (MSD), (2) spectral entropy (SE), and (3) a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. While MSD and SE represent conventional, rule-based approaches requiring manually defined thresholds, the CNN model offers a more scalable, automated solution for classifying nanopore events directly from raw time series data. All three methods were capable of distinguishing between signal classes; however, the CNN model demonstrated superior sensitivity and robustness. This work highlights the importance of data interpretation in nanopore sensing and presents a comparative framework for binary event classification.

We demonstrate this phenomenon in clonal hematopoiesis, in which a hematopoietic stem cell acquires a fitness-conferring mutation that leads to clonal expansion. Exploiting these dynamics, we developed COMET (Clonal Observation from METhylation), which quantifies clonal burden from bulk methylation data without prior knowledge of driving mutations. Validation against targeted sequencing demonstrated robust prediction across mutation types, accurate longitudinal tracking, and detection of sequencing artifacts. Applied to 15,900 individuals, COMET-predicted clonal hematopoiesis replicated known genetic associations (TCL1A, NRIP1) and phenotypic relationships with smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Prior studies found that EML4-ALK, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) fusion oncoprotein, suppresses transmembrane receptor signaling through EGFR. Moreover, suppression was reversed with targeted ALK inhibition, thereby promoting survival and drug tolerance. Here we tested whether such modulation of EGFR was common among other RTK fusions, which collectively are found in ~5% of all cancers. Using live- and fixed-cell microscopy in isogenic and patient-derived cell lines, we found that a wide variety of RTK fusions suppress transmembrane EGFR and sequester essential adaptor proteins in the cytoplasm, as evidenced by the localization of endogenous Grb2. Targeted therapies rapidly released Grb2 from sequestration and potentiated EGFR. Synthetic optogenetic analogs of RTK fusions confirmed that cytoplasmic sequestration of Grb2 was sufficient to suppress perception of extracellular EGF and could do so without driving signaling from the synthetic fusion itself, demonstrating that fusion signaling and suppression of EGFR could be functionally decoupled.

G.", "abstract": "Introduction: Sepsis, the most severe manifestation of infection, remains both common and life-threatening. Beyond the acute phase, growing evidence highlights that sepsis survivors face an increased risk of chronic organ dysfunction, including kidney and heart failure. While early immune mechanisms of sepsis have been extensively studied, the biological processes underlying delayed post-sepsis organ sequelae remain poorly understood. Methods: Using murine models of sepsis, we investigated the long-term impact of sepsis on organ immune landscapes and tissue repair. Fate-mapping experiments were conducted to trace macrophage origin and persistence. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the heart and kidney was performed to characterize macrophage subpopulations and transcriptional reprogramming following sepsis. Functional consequences of this immune remodeling were assessed by challenging post-septic animals with angiotensin II to evaluate secondary injury susceptibility and fibrotic remodeling. Results: Sepsis induced transient multiorgan failure but led to a sustained expansion of tissue macrophages. Fate-mapping demonstrated that this expansion was largely driven by the recruitment and engraftment of monocyte-derived macrophages. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed that post-septic macrophages acquired a distinct proinflammatory and profibrotic signature, consistent with persistent microenvironmental activation. Functionally, this altered macrophage landscape impaired organ resilience, as evidenced by increased mortality and exacerbated cardiac and renal fibrosis upon secondary challenge. Discussion: Our findings identify macrophage reprogramming as a central mechanism linking sepsis to long-term organ vulnerability. The persistence of monocyte-derived macrophages with maladaptive transcriptional profiles promotes fibrotic remodeling and impaired tissue repair. Targeting macrophage recruitment or reprogramming may represent a promising strategy to prevent chronic organ failure among sepsis survivors.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

How fungi from stress-rich but competition-free material surfaces handle iron uptake is, however, unknown. We studied these processes in rock-inhabiting fungi, known for their constitutive melanin-production, extremotolerant lifestyle and colonization of exposed surfaces such as solar panels and marble monuments, by choosing Knufia petricola to represent this group. The characterization of targeted mutants showed that K. petricola produces an extracellular - yet undefined - siderophore on which it relies less than on the ferroxidase-iron permease complex for reductive iron assimilation. By disrupting melanin synthesis, it was demonstrated that this pigment can reduce and adsorb iron but nevertheless does not contribute significantly to iron acquisition. Moreover, growth towards an iron source was found to be siderophore-dependent. Ferric citrate could not be directly assimilated. Finally, it was found that K. petricola and other rock-inhabiting fungi exhibited high sensitivity to strong iron chelators such as EDTA. These observations not only offer a potential mitigation strategy for preventing fungal colonization of subaerial materials using iron chelators, but also highlight the specialized adaptations of these fungi to low-competition environments.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

To model PTC, eight Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM) were infected with barcoded SIVmac239M and began an 8-month ART regimen two weeks post-infection (wpi). Six months following ART interruption, all MCM were rechallenged with non-barcoded SIVmac239 followed by CD8+ cell depletion two months later. Animals were grouped as viremic (n=5) or aviremic (n=3) based on the detection of plasma viremia between ART interruption and CD8+ cell depletion; all animals became viremic post-depletion. Barcode sequencing of plasma virus revealed that lineages with high pre-ART viral loads dominated the rebounding populations post-depletion and detectable rechallenge virus in two animals post-depletion. Additional sequencing of three CD8+ T cell epitopes within plasma viruses identified point mutations only in viruses isolated from the viremic group post-depletion. A second cohort of 5 MCM who initiated ART 8 wpi was examined to identify the impact of the timing of ART initiation on viral epitope diversity and showed increased diversity prior to ART initiation and following ART interruption.

These fish possess a unique suite of traits, including regional endothermy, in their swimming muscle, viscera, brain and eyes that elevates tissue temperatures significantly above ambient water temperatures. Bluefin tuna also have an efficient thunniform locomotory style, involving a fusiform low drag external shape and a novel musculoskeletal system that enhances elastic energy storage. Together the unique swimming form and warm muscle temperatures enable this species to move across large expanses of the ocean. Atlantic bluefin tuna are targeted by high-value international fisheries of over fifty nations. Populations have recovered in recent years and the species is now actively farmed extensively within the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic. To date, fisheries management and evolutionary studies have been hampered by a lack of genomic resources. Here, we report a novel de novo chromosome-level phased genome assembly for the Atlantic bluefin tuna obtained using PacBio HiFi reads and Dovetail Omni-C scaffolding. This assembly was scaffolded into 24 chromosomes containing 98% of the genes in the BUSCO reference dataset, demonstrating a high level of contiguity with a contig N50 of 26.54 and assembly size of ~800Mbp. We compare a diploid-resolved (2N) genome assembly of Atlantic bluefin tuna with a haplotype-collapsed (1N) genome assembly from a Pacific bluefin tuna caught in the eastern Pacific off California.

In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of compensation methods in impedance spectroscopy to improve measurement accuracy using a self-developed four-point platinum electrode designed for biological tissue applications. Three compensation algorithms - open-short, open-short-load, and multiple-load - were implemented and compared using an RC parallel test circuit that emulated typical measurement conditions, with load resistances ranging from 250 Ohm to 5000 Ohm. Quantitative error analysis demonstrated that the multiple-load method achieved the lowest normalized root mean square error (3.4%) and superior stability across frequencies from 100 Hz to 1 MHz.

Previously in our lab, we identified Protein Kinase CK2 as an important kinase involved in the pathophysiology of HD. Specifically, the alpha prime catalytic subunit of CK2 (CK2') is upregulated in HD, and genetic depletion of CK2' in HD mice results in improved motor behavior, decreased mutant Htt aggregation, and improved neuronal function. Silmitasertib (CX-4945) is an FDA designated orphan drug that inhibits CK2. This study aims to investigate whether CX-4945 treatment ameliorates HD pathology. We treated prodromal and late symptomatic HD mice, and used a variety of immunohistochemical, biochemical, physiological and behavioral approaches. We found that CX-4945 presented benefits in the amelioration of HD pathophysiology in both treated groups.

However, EEG analyses are frequently conducted with limited a priori knowledge regarding locations or latencies of meaningful statistical effects. This makes it difficult for researchers to form regions of interest (ROIs), which are then analyzed using traditional statistical models such as analysis of variance. In addition, exploratory studies, or studies interested in determining the exact temporal and spatial extent of a predicted effect may aim to examine many sensor locations and time points, often jointly. To address this, mass univariate analyses have become a valuable complement to ROI-based approaches. These methods attempt to correct for multiple comparisons while mitigating the risk of false positives and false negatives, thus enabling statistical inference in high-dimensional EEG data. Here, we review and evaluate different approaches for delineating spatial and temporal effect boundaries in three different datasets, focusing on within-subjects comparisons. Specifically, we focus on permutation-based approaches and their Bayesian alternatives to address condition differences in i) steady-state evoked responses, ii) event-related potentials, and iii) time-frequency data. Overall, simulation results indicate that cluster-based permutation tests provide a relatively liberal approach to correct for multiple comparisons across domains, with high sensitivity for detecting large effects. In contrast, the permutation-based tmax procedure yields the most conservative method across datasets. Bayesian approaches inherently are continuous in nature and thus strongly depend on the selection of thresholds for when support for a hypothesis is considered meaningful.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

While the effects of agricultural practices were investigated across various crop types and wildlife species, reptiles remain largely overlooked. Additionally, although reptiles in croplands were monitored throughout the farming season, little attention has been directed towards the effects of harvest at the season's end. To illustrate the potential impacts of mechanical harvest on wildlife in permanent crops, we present a case-study concerning reptiles in vineyards. We scanned the waste of a medium-sized winery over four nights and found 105 reptiles, 69% of them chameleons. Though chameleons are considered carnivorous, approximately half had consumed grapes, potentially attracted by them. Vineyards, like many crops, offer resources including sugar, water, and shelter, likely attracting many wildlife species. However, mortality during mechanical harvest may be high, potentially rendering such crops an ecological trap. For chameleons the effects may be particularly devastating, as harvest closely precedes the egg-laying season. While our case study focuses on reptiles in vineyards, its implications extend to many species in permanent crops. Ultimately, ecological traps affect biodiversity by attracting animals to habitats in which their fitness is impaired. While preference has been widely discussed in determining trap severity, our case study highlights that considering the trap's fitness impact is also crucial.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

We further show that this failure is not due to a lack of phylogenetic signal in the latent space, which does recapitulate evolutionary structure.

We found strong differences in the evolutionary dynamics of hosts and pathogens in the absence of coevolution. While host evolution often favoured genotypes with intermediate levels of juvenile and adult resistance, pathogen evolution selected for extreme specialists. When hosts and pathogens were allowed to coevolve, the dynamics more closely resembled the pathogen dynamics; pathogens rapidly evolved to specialize on infecting a specific age class and this drove reciprocal specialization in host resistance.

Here, we present a semantic-aware graph neural network (GNN) framework that features holistic mechanisms to capture long-range molecular interactions and the chemical semantics of antileishmanial compounds. Across two classificatory antileishmanial datasets, our holistic GNNs demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) increases of 2.2-29.2% on the unbalanced dataset (1 M threshold) and 3.4-22.5% on the balanced dataset (10 M threshold) compared to default GNNs. Subsequently, the framework was applied to screen a library of approximately 1.3 million compounds, pinpointing LC-61 as a potent antileishmanial agent with nanomolar activity against intracellular L. infantum (IC50 = 0.076 M) and minimal cytotoxicity to macrophages (THP-1 CC50 = 157 M). A comprehensive in vitro ADME profiling revealed that LC-61 combines high solubility at both acidic and physiological pH (>28 g/mL), balanced lipophilicity (eLogD = 4.07), and favorable passive permeability (PAMPA = 4.86 x 10-6 cm/s), while exhibiting lower microsomal stability. Overall, our semantic-aware GNN framework effectively accelerated the discovery of LC-61, a novel and biologically validated hit suitable for hit-to-lead optimization.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

J.; Wilhelm, M.", "abstract": "Deep learning models are often characterized as black boxes because their layers of various mathematical transformations and activation functions are practically uninterpretable and have little meaning to the user. However, explainable AI methods exist to attribute model output predictions to its inputs. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is one such method that directly quantifies the inputs' contributions and qualitatively addresses the question of why a model makes a particular prediction. SHAP generally is hampered by its computational cost, which scales very poorly with large inputs. Therefore peptide property predictors that take as input amino acid sequences, roughly between the lengths of 10-30 amino acids, represent ideal systems for applying SHAP. In applying SHAP to models that predict retention time, collisional cross section, peptide flyability, and fragment intensity, we obtain the relative influence that each amino acid has on predicting each property, and furthermore can rationalize the values from the perspective of the amino acids' chemistry. Simply correlating the average shapley values per amino acid type over an entire validation dataset has yielded high correlation to published amino acid indices that are highly related to the property being predicted. For instance, our average shapley values for retention time had a 0.973 Pearson correlation with experimentally measured amino acid retention indices at pH 2. In applying SHAP on the Prosit fragment intensity prediction model, there is strong agreement with the mobile proton model, specifically demonstrating the effect of basic amino acids, the proline effect in charge-remote fragmentation, and positively charged amino acids in charge-directed fragmentation. We also use SHAP in a targeted experiment to demonstrate the Pathways in competition behavior of the model, and reveal a very discrete decision process based on basic residues and the fragment charge. While SHAP in this work was applied to models of well understood properties/systems, there is great potential to explain less studied areas of peptide chemistry to provide insights into their mechanisms.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

W.; Levine, Z. A.", "abstract": "Background: Inherited variations in the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene are the largest genetic determinant for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, with the APOE{epsilon}4 allele conferring the highest risk. While APOE was shown to modulate amyloid beta (A{beta}) pathology in a genotype-specific manner (APOE{epsilon}4>APOE{epsilon}3>APOE{epsilon}2), it remains an important open question whether these differences are due directly to isoform-specific interactions between ApoE and A{beta} or indirect effects on A{beta} clearance. This is further complicated because ApoE exists in lipidated or unlipidated states, which influence its biochemical properties. To disentangle how single ApoE mutations confer vastly different effects on A{beta} pathology, we investigated how both the ApoE isoform and lipidation modulate its interaction with inert and cytotoxic A{beta} species, and its effect on A{beta} uptake and cytotoxicity in human astrocytes. Methods: We prepared A{beta} in distinct aggregation states (monomers, oligomers, and fibrils) and ApoE in different lipidation states to characterize their size and affinity for one another using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence polarization, respectively. We then utilized flow cytometry and live cell imaging to quantify the uptake of A{beta} in different aggregation states by primary and immortalized human astrocytes in the presence of different isoforms of lipidated or unlipidated ApoE. Results: This study revealed that ApoE lipidation, not isoform, has the biggest impact on its interaction with A{beta}, on the uptake of A{beta} by astrocytes, and on A{beta}-induced cytotoxicity. Specifically, unlipidated ApoE preferentially interacts with A{beta} oligomers and fibrils, which substantially inhibits their uptake by astrocytes. Conversely, lipidated ApoE showed no interaction with A{beta} oligomers and had a reduced ability to inhibit A{beta} uptake. Conclusions: Our observations provide important molecular details that suggest previously observed ApoE isoform-specific differences in AD risk are likely driven primarily by in vivo differences in ApoE lipidation, rather than biophysical differences between ApoE isoforms in their interaction with A{beta}. We propose that the impaired lipidation of ApoE4 in the brain increases levels of unlipidated ApoE, which then bind toxic A{beta} oligomers and reduce their clearance by astrocytes. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of interventions aimed at increasing ApoE lipidation and decreasing interactions between toxic A{beta} oligomers and ApoE", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

A powerful approach has been to combine droplet on \"demand tape drive\" sample delivery with X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) that correlates atomic structure with electronic states of metal ions within the sample. To our knowledge, such a combined methodology has not been deployed previously at a synchrotron beamline and has been restricted to XFELs.

Among these, DNA methylation is central to balancing genome stability and transcriptional flexibility. We analyzed methylation dynamics in Arabidopsis thaliana under heat, phosphate deficiency, and their combination- conditions that frequently co-occur in nature -using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, small RNA-seq and RNA-seq of shoots and roots in a setup closely mimicking field conditions. Stress-specific patterns emerged: heat and combined stress led to CHH hypomethylation in both shoot and root, while phosphate deficiency triggered hypermethylation in shoots but hypomethylation in roots. Importantly, the epigenetic response to combined stress was not a mere additive effect of individual stresses but displayed a distinct methylation signature. While both RdDM and CMT2 pathways contributed to heat-induced changes, CMT2 predominated under phosphate deficiency and combined stress, underscoring mechanistic specificity. Methylation changes concentrated in transposable elements (TEs) and intergenic regions, yet TE methylation shifts showed limited correlation with TE or adjacent gene expression, suggesting methylation does not act as a direct transcriptional switch. Instead, stress-induced methylation may influence chromatin accessibility at regulatory regions, particularly transcription factor binding sites; GATA motifs appeared as especially relevant in our analyses. A striking signature emerged in the nuclear mitochondrial DNA (NUMT) region, where hypomethylation under heat and combined stress correlated with upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation genes, critical for thermotolerance. Our findings highlight DNA methylation as an intricate regulatory layer integrating environmental signals into plant adaptive responses, offering a foundation for strategies to harness epigenetic plasticity for crop resilience under climate change.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Clinical symptoms include vision loss, motor impairments, and cognitive challenges, making it difficult to accurately assess neurocognitive and perceptual abilities. Thus, there is a critical need to identify objective biomarkers that can be used to inform disease progression and track treatment response in this population. Methods: This exploratory study investigates longitudinal changes in auditory sensory perceptual processing in a small sample of individuals with genetically confirmed CLN3 disease (N=4; 3 male) compared to a cross-sectional sample of 60 neurotypical (NT) controls using high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We utilized a duration mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm, identical to what has been used in our previous cross-sectional study. We examined the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) of the standard tones across three different stimulus onset asynchrony conditions and examined the N1 and P2 components of the AEP. Results: We found age related differences in the amplitudes of the N1 and P2 components in individuals with CLN3 disease relative to NT controls. These amplitude differences were most notable in CLN3 disease when participants were presented with standard tones that had the slowest presentation rate. Specifically, N1 and P2 amplitudes were more negative than NT controls in childhood and adolescence and as CLN3 disease participants aged, the amplitude of the AEPs was greater than controls. Further, a more positive N1 amplitude during the longest stimulus presentation condition was associated with both reduced verbal intelligence and working memory abilities in CLN3 disease participants. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings parallel recently published work in a mouse model of CLN3 disease that showed both sex- and age-dependent disruptions in central auditory processing. Taken together, we demonstrate the utility of auditory EEG measures as a sensitive, objective and translational measure in CLN3 disease that may serve as a potential outcome measure useful in tracking disease progression.

While optimization of electrode placement is important to increase treatment efficacy, clinical therapy planning is done using an undisclosed and proprietary software (NovoTAL), which is clinically unvalidated. This study investigates a new computational approach for optimizing TTFields electrode placement and is compared to the current clinical standard. Methods: We developed a new computational pipeline integrating patient-specific anatomical data to optimize electrode configurations in five representative glioblastoma cases with diverse tumor locations and sizes. Two optimization strategies were employed: one maximizing electric field intensity at the tumor, and another enhancing coverage of the adjacent brain while maintaining sufficient tumor intensity. Results were compared to electrode placements generated by NovoTAL. Additional simulations with artificial tumors assessed the effects of tumor size and location. Results: Optimized electrode placements improved electric field intensity in tumors by 18%-34% compared to the clinical standard. Coverage-weighted optimizations provided broader field coverage without significantly compromising tumor intensity. Smaller or surface-adjacent tumors benefited most from optimization, achieving precise targeting and enhanced coverage. Extensive randomized placement analyses highlighted the superior performance of the optimized configurations. Analysis of artificial models showed consistent improvements across varying tumor locations and sizes. Conclusion: Personalized optimization of TTFields electrode placement significantly improves electric field targeting of tumors and adjacent brain regions. This approach outperforms standardized planning software and clinical practices and supports future development of adaptive, automated strategies for individualized TTFields therapy in glioblastoma.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Although CD8+T cells contribute to immune control of tuberculosis, the pathways through which bacterial antigens access major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation remain incompletely defined. Here, we show that the activity of an Mtb secretion system actively promotes antigen presentation on MHC-I. Using quantitative immunopeptidomics, host and bacterial genetic perturbations, and T cell activation assays, we demonstrate that presentation of Mtb-derived peptides on MHC-I requires the ESX-1 type VII secretion system. Presentation of these peptides proceeds in a manner dependent on the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) but independent of host cell mechanisms such as autophagy or MPEG1-mediated pore formation. Chemical induction of phagosomal membrane damage fails to restore antigen presentation in the absence of ESX-1 activity, suggesting that pathogen-encoded secretion, not nonspecific membrane rupture, governs access to MHC-I antigen processing pathways. These findings reveal a secretion system-driven mechanism of antigen presentation, redefining how mycobacteria interface with host MHC-I pathways, potentially informing tuberculosis vaccine design strategies, and highlighting a potential route for synthetic antigen delivery to the cytosol in therapeutics and vaccination.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

P.; Van Vuren, D. H.", "abstract": "Plasticity in the timing of reproduction may enable species to adapt to changing climates and match reproductive demands to shifting peaks of energy availability. At high elevations, hibernating mammals are often facing drier winters and earlier snowmelt, shifting the onset of the vegetative growing season. We expect substantial plasticity in reproductive phenology at these sites because inter-annual variation in snowmelt date is typically high. However, whether species are reaching limits of phenological plasticity with ongoing directional change has rarely been assessed for vertebrate populations; identification of phenological limits is important to predict further adaptive capacity. Here, we use 30 years of litter weaning dates of golden-mantled ground squirrels (Callospermophilus lateralis) from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, USA, to assess individual plasticity in reproductive phenology, population trends over time, and whether the population has reached a limit of plasticity. On average, litter weaning dates advanced by 2.3days/decade over the study period. We found that individual reproductive timing was quite plastic and exhibited near-zero heritability. At the population level, a linear relationship between average date of litter weaning and date of snowmelt suggests further potential for phenological adaptation to earlier springs. However, litters emerge later in relation to vegetative phenology in early springs, generating a potential mismatch between peak vegetative abundance and energetic demands of mothers and pups.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

We discovered that synergy emerges from duplicated genes that partitioned functions to regulate inflorescence architecture and floral organ identity. Moreover, synergistic interactions are reflected in non-additive expression changes that coordinate successive developmental stages. Finally, we demonstrate that synergy occurs due to residual redundancy on a dose-sensitive module guiding floral identity.

One target of EtOH is the glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptor (AMPAR). Both EtOH exposure and cessation influences AMPAR expression, function, and broad glutamate signaling. Studies of EtOH-related AMPAR regulation suggest that EtOH regulation of AMPARs drives behaviors related to dependence and memory phenotypes. However, due to the complexity of the mammalian brain, it is difficult to unravel the precise mechanism by which EtOH regulates AMPARs in mammals to modify specific memory behaviors. In C. elegans, GLR-1, an AMPAR ortholog, has tightly defined expression in relatively few neurons, has conserved regulatory mechanisms, and is linked to molecularly conserved associative behaviors including those disrupted by EtOH. Using an established paradigm that exposes worms to chronic EtOH and cessation ( i.e. withdrawal), we examined the relationship between cessation from chronic EtOH exposure, associative memory, and GLR-1/AMPAR regulation. We found that cessation from chronic EtOH disrupts intermediate-term associative memory (ITM) in wild-type worms, phenocopying loss of GLR-1 function. Next, we found that loss of GLR-1 occludes the ITM deficit and EtOH-ceased wild-types phenocopy glr-1 loss-of-function in other glutamate-dependent behaviors. We demonstrate that cessation downregulates glr-1, and increases CREB-mediated transcriptional activity in neurons, whereas losing CREB protects against cessation-induced glr-1 downregulation and associated behavior deficits. Overall, CREB-mediated repression of glr-1 may regulate behavior deficits in cessation.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Interfascicular interfaces placed within the peripheral nerve, but outside of the fascicles preserving the perineurium are a promising avenue in balancing this tradeoff. This study quantifies electrode placement using novel tools designed to deliver flexible microwires interfascicularly in a porcine model . Methods: Seven Yorkshire pigs were implanted with Minimally invasive interfascicular Nerve Stimulation (MiiNS) arrays in the nerves of the brachial plexus resulting in a total of ten implanted nerve samples. High-resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of implanted nerves stained with phosphotungistic acid (PTA) showed electrode placement relative to fascicular anatomy and all other contacts . The analysis also examined the relationship between microwire trajectory angle and fascicle traversal. Further, in a subset of samples (n=4), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histological analysis was performed after micro-CT imaging. These histological images were coregistered with the micro-CT to validate the positional information of the micro-CT. Results: Across the 56 total MiiNS microwire placements , 84% were interfascicular, while 16% were intrafascicular, characterized by traversal through a fascicle. Contacts were broadly distributed throughout the nerve cross section and the majority (79%) were in the central half of the nerve cross section (R>0.707), with no evidence of angular clustering in any single direction. On average, nearest neighbor distances between contacts measured 2256.26+/-1760.28 um in 3D and 730.71 +/-564.83 um transversely, with implants spanning 10.3 +/- 4.3 mm along length of nerve. The angle of wire trajectory into the nerve was correlated with fascicle traversal, with steeper angles of insertion associated with more instances of fascicle traversal. Histological analysis corroborated the fascicular borders and wire placements found on micro-CT and demonstrated perineurium integrity. Significance: Interfascicular implantation can reliably access both central and distributed regions of the nerve, while not being confined to a single plane, enabling access to regions which have been historically challenging to stimulate effectively. The observed nearest-neighbor transverse spacing between contacts is within the range of reported ideal values for selective activation. The MiiNS placement characteristics show its potential as an effective peripheral nerve interface alternative which achieves distributed contact placement, including in the center of the nerve volume, while remaining predominantly outside of the perineurium.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Our results demonstrate that PDT induces dose- and time-dependent spatial heterogenic alterations in both oxygenation and perfusion. To better interpret the spatial interplay between tumor oxygenation and vascular perfusion, we developed a Vascular Function Index (VFI), which classifies tumor subregions into four functional quadrants based on perfusion and oxygenation status at every voxel within the 3D tumor region. This framework revealed dynamic, time-dependent changes in tumor hypoxia and perfusion, with high-dose treatment groups showing a progressive increase in hypoxic and non-perfused regions, underscoring the spatiotemporal nature of PDT-induced vascular response.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Several Pol I inhibitors have been identified that induce potent anti-cancer effects. However, clinical application of the first-in-class Pol I inhibitor, CX-5461, has been limited by patient toxicity, which is comparable to other chemotherapies. Identifying synergistic drug combinations offers a promising strategy to maintain on-target anti-cancer effects while minimizing adverse reactions. Synergistic drug combinations involve drugs that enhance each other's effect, enabling dose reduction while preserving efficacy. Synergistic drug combinations of Pol I inhibitors and other anti-cancer agents have been reported; however, it remains unclear whether Pol I inhibitors can synergize with each other. We therefore explored whether two Pol I inhibitors synergize in cancer treatment. We found that CX-5461 and BMH-21 significantly reduced MCF-7 breast cancer cell viability at clinically relevant doses. Combined treatment with these inhibitors led to profound viability defects at sub-micromolar concentrations. Our biochemical analysis showed that CX-5461 and BMH-21 combination therapy enhanced Pol I inhibition and p53 activation compared to monotherapy, promoting growth arrest and apoptosis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CX-5461 and BMH-21 are complementary in inhibiting Pol I, activating p53, and suppressing cancer cell growth. Based on these pre-clinical findings, dual Pol I inhibition with CX-5461 and BMH-21 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating cancer that is potentially both broadly applicable and tolerable.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of Diffusion Models and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), both incorporating modern architectural enhancements including spectral normalization, self-attention mechanisms, and conditional generation, for addressing class imbalance in lung cancer CT classification. Using the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset comprising 1,097 CT images across normal, benign, and malignant categories with statistical validation across 10 independent runs, we evaluated both approaches through quantitative image quality metrics (Frechet Inception Distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Kernel Inception Distance, and Inception Score) and downstream classification performance. While Diffusion models consistently outperformed DCGANs across most image quality measures, the clinical significance was confirmed through task-based validation. Both generative approaches successfully addressed class imbalance: DCGAN-augmented datasets achieved overall accuracy of 0.9760 +/- 0.0116 with benign recall improvement from 0.833 to 0.933, while Diffusion-augmented datasets reached superior performance of 0.9959 +/- 0.0068 with perfect benign recall (1.000 +/- 0.000). Critically for cancer screening where false negatives carry severe consequences, Diffusion maintained the highest malignant detection sensitivity (0.997 +/- 0.008) with substantially lower performance variance, demonstrating more consistent synthetic data quality. These findings establish that while both modern architectures can mitigate class imbalance, Diffusion models' superior recall performance and lower variability position them as the preferred approach for high-stakes clinical applications, demonstrating that ultimate validation must prioritize downstream clinical task performance over image quality metrics alone.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrated chromosome-scale genome assembly, transcriptome profiling, and bleaching experiments involving Tridacna crocea to explore the genetic basis of extracellular symbiosis. Signals associated with sterol transport by Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NPC2) transporters and carbon-concentrating mechanisms suggest that giant clams share some nutrient exchange strategies with corals. Strikingly, the nitrate transporter NRT2, a \"plant-like\" gene previously thought to be absent in animals, represents an unexpected evolutionary retention that enables nitrate-based nutrient supply, highlighting a fundamental divergence from coral symbiosis.

Microglia-mediated debris clearance is critical for WMI repair. The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an essential role in the central nervous system diseases, one of the ways in which gut microbiota affects brain is via producing metabolites. Indole-3-proprionic acid (IPA), a tryptophan-derived metabolite that mainly produced by Clostridium sporogenes, exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, its effect on ICH remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the IPA level after ICH and the therapeutic effects of IPA on neurological deficits and WMI, as well as the potential mechanisms underlying IPA-mediated neuroprotection. Methods: An ICH model was established using C57BL/6 mice, which then received intragastric IPA (20 mg/kg/day). Fecal abundance of IPA-related genes and IPA levels in feces and plasma were measured by qPCR and UPLC-MS/MS. Behavioral tests, qPCR, and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess neurological function, myelin integrity, and axonal injury. In vitro, BV2 microglia, with or without Stap1 knockdown, were co-cultured with myelin debris to assess IPA?s effects on phagocytosis. Additionally, targeted plasma IPA profiling was performed in 30 ICH patients and 30 matched healthy controls. Results: The relative abundance of IPA production-related genes and IPA levels in feces and plasma were significantly decreased after ICH and remained low into the chronical phase. After IPA administration, the neurological deficits, myelin loss and axonal injury of mice with ICH were significantly improved. In vitro, IPA increased BV2 microglia myelin debris phagocytosis by inhibiting Stap1 expression. IPA levels were significantly reduced in ICH patients, consistent with ICH mouse model. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that the gut microbiota-derived metabolite IPA could facilitate neurological deficits recovery and alleviate WMI, which could be a promising therapeutic strategy to improve ICH prognosis.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

However, collective actions require costly inter-individual coordination, making continuous cost-benefit evaluation essential before engaging in cooperation. Non-human primate models can help uncover the evolutionary foundations of human cooperation and its underlying neural mechanisms. To this aim, we developed a novel paradigm to analyze the dyadic behavior of two macaques, who took turns in choosing between individual and cooperative actions to obtain variable rewards. Each monkey used a joystick to guide a cursor toward one of two targets, each indicating both the reward magnitude and the action type (i.e. 'solo action' or 'joint action') required to obtain their payoff. We first observed a linear improvement in dyadic performance with the expected reward magnitude. Although macaques tended to prefer individual actions, they selected to act jointly under favorable payoff conditions, indicating that voluntary cooperation in macaques can emerge as a reward-driven process. Logistic models of their choices revealed the subjective cost monkeys assigned to cooperation, which was consistent across subjects. Nonetheless, the gain rate across different sessions increased over time, suggesting that macaques possess the cognitive ability to optimize their dyadic strategies, by estimating not only the coordination costs but also the benefits of cooperation. We observed a progressive reduction in the subjective cost assigned to joint action, which was not directly dependent on performance improvements. Our findings suggest that non-human primates can weigh the costs and benefits of cooperation, highlighting their ability to dynamically adjust social strategies based on reward contingencies.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

However, our understanding of the basic viral life cycle and the underlying causes of viral pathogenesis remains sparse, in large part due to a lack of molecular biology tools for hantaviruses and the need to work in high-containment laboratory facilities with these viruses. Here, we investigated the kinetics of infectious Tula virus (TULV) particle production in Vero E6 cells and subsequent stability in cell culture media. In addition, we evaluated the stability of infectious virus particles in response to different physical and environmental stresses, including heat, freezing, dehydration and UV exposure, answering key questions about the environmental transmission potential of hantaviruses. Interestingly, we observed a remarkable stability of TULV when stored at room temperature or colder, as well as after dehydration, which suggests that hantaviruses could remain infectious for a sustained period of time after being secreted by their host species. Subsequently, we determined the ability of commonly used virus inactivation methods, including RNA and protein extraction buffers, to inactivate TULV both in a cell-free and cell-associated context and found that TULV was efficiently inactivated by all these methods similar to other enveloped RNA viruses. Finally, we successfully validated the complete inactivation using these inactivation methods using the highly pathogenic HCPS-causing New World Andes virus (ANDV) and the HFRS-causing Old World Hantaan virus (HTNV).

Skeletal muscle from patients was characterized by type II muscle fiber atrophy, greater collagen deposition, and redistribution of lipids to the extracellular matrix. This coincided with a shift in fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), favouring the CD90- subtype, and experiments using conditioned media indicated a catabolic secretory phenotype from patient- derived FAPs.

Our findings reveal significant associations between testicular function and the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, lungs, liver, and key brain regions involved in neuroendocrine regulation, including the amygdala, substantia nigra, anterior cingulate cortex, and frontal cortex.

Bears occur more often in high wildland-urban interface areas, especially those closer to communist-era elite-hunting grounds with feeding sites. These patterns reflect a long-term legacy of 1960s population management policies interacting with environmental and behavioral processes to shape recent bear behavior.

However, morphology is not fixed. As corals grow and develop from singular polyps to mature adult colonies, they experience pronounced changes in their morphology. This developmental trait variation remains poorly quantified in corals, despite their importance as ecosystem engineers. To address this gap, we used photogrammetry to track the morphological development of wild coral colonies across six size-independent metrics designed to capture variation in volume compactness, surface complexity, and top-heaviness. Size-trait models and analyses of colony movement through morphological trait space revealed that small colonies shared compact morphologies and only later diverged along growth-form-specific developmental trajectories. Massive corals largely retained stable shapes as they grew, whereas non-massive colonies became less compact, more top-heavy, and in most cases, more complex. Despite these differences, there was still overlap between growth forms in their developmental trajectories through morphospace. These findings highlight that traditional categorical growth forms mask important developmental variation, particularly early in coral ontogeny. By applying a quantitative trait-based framework, this study improves understanding of coral morphological development and provides a foundation for linking individual growth trajectories to broader reef ecosystem dynamics.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

While co-divergence and host-switching have been extensively explored in systems, such as Wolbachia-arthropod symbioses or viruses infecting vertebrates, similar investigations in protistan parasites remain scarce. The Leishmania-Leishmaniavirus (LRV) association offers a rare opportunity to study co-divergence in a medically relevant symbiotic system, in which the virus modulates the parasitic disease severity in humans. Here, we used total RNA sequencing to capture both the Leishmania transcriptome and the LRV genome simultaneously, enabling the first comprehensive investigation of the co-evolutionary history of Leishmania and LRV across different hierarchical levels (subgenus, species and population). We found significant positive correlations between the parasite and viral genetic distances at both the subgenus (R2 = 0.89; F = 10,913.49; p < 0.001) and species level (focusing on L.

This was corroborated by additional co-phylogenetic methods (global-fit and event-based), indicating a strong pattern of phylogenetic congruence between Leishmania and LRV up to the species level. Only at the population level, focusing on the interactions of L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (V.) guyanensis with LRV1, we found weaker co-phylogenetic signals accompanied by more instances of intraspecific host switching.

Yet, the developmental processes that facilitate evolution of polyphenic traits remain poorly understood. We address this question in ants, where caste polyphenism is key to their division of labor, producing winged reproductive castes (queens and males) and a wingless non-reproductive worker caste. Here, we investigate the expression of a gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying the evolution and development of a caste-specific trait in ants, the ocelli; 3 simple single-lens eyes on the dorsal head of flying insects. We focus on a hyperdiverse subfamily of ants (Formicinae), where 3 ocelli are always present in males and queens, while the worker caste shows dramatic variation in the presence/absence or number of ocelli across species. We discovered that ocelli in the worker caste underwent at least 3 independent and partial phylogenetic reversions, giving rise to workers with only a single ocellus. We also discovered that, in two closely related species whose adult workers completely lack ocelli, the ocelli GRN remains expressed throughout larval head development and is interrupted only in downstream genes at later stages. Consequently, rudimentary ocelli transiently appear in pupae but disappear before adulthood. This latent expression of the ocelli GRN therefore facilitated these partial reversions to a single ocellus, leading to a novel phenotypic pattern of ocelli in the worker caste. We propose that latent developmental potentials may generally underlie polyphenic traits and facilitate full or partial reversion with novel phenotypic patterns.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Here we present an inherent T cell activating polymer lipid nanoparticle (ERTLNPs) that enable ligand-free, efficient mRNA transfection and activation of T cells in vivo. ERTLNPs, composed of p-toluenesulfonyl arginine (RT) functionalized polyethylenimine (denoted as PEI-RT) and helper lipids, preferentially accumulate in the spleen following systemic administration.

Current AMP prediction methods, however, are limited by dataset biases such as sequence length imbalance between AMPs and non-AMPs, N-terminal methionine artifacts in non-AMPs, and microbial origin specificity. To overcome these constraints, we developed a dual-engine predictor named XAMP, which integrates two complementary architectures: XAMP-E, built on ESM-2 for high-accuracy feature representation, and XAMP-T, built on one-layer Transformer for accelerating large-scale screening. This dual-engine design ensures both robust feature learning and enhanced generalization capability. By constructing length-balanced datasets, removing N-terminal methionine from non-AMPs, and training microbial-specific variants, XAMP achieved a median area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.972, representing an approximately 10% improvement over state-of-the-art predictors.

Here, we directly quantify calcium-mediated fusion of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) using a microfluidic trapping platform combined with confocal microscopy, enabling simultaneous measurement of lipid mixing, content mixing, and fusion outcomes across hundreds of single vesicles. We systematically map fusion efficiency as a function of calcium concentration, membrane composition, and mechanically imposed tension. We find that calcium-induced fusion of GUVs in the absence of proteins is remarkably fickle and composition-sensitive, as the vesicles need to be sufficiently instable to allow the opening of the fusion pore, yet stable enough to prevent bursting and collapse. Negatively charged GUVs containing high fractions of DOPE exhibit the highest fusogenic responsiveness, whereas other compositions undergo extensive lipid mixing without pore formation. Increasing membrane tension can shift this balance and promote full fusion, revealing a narrow parameter space in which calcium acts as an effective protein-free fusogen for cell-sized membranes. These findings clarify longstanding discrepancies between LUV- and GUV-based calcium fusion assays and provide quantitative design rules for employing calcium as a fusogen in synthetic biology and membrane-reconstitution studies, where controlled membrane growth, vesicle-vesicle fusion, and module integration are central to building and sustaining artificial cells.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the harmonized protocol for the posterior portion of the hippocampus (the 'tail'), complementing the previously established 'body' protocol, and with an anterior 'head' protocol under development. The tail protocol provides standardized definitions of the external boundaries for the posterior-most extent of the hippocampus, facilitating consistent segmentation from surrounding tissues. The research community was extensively involved through an online survey that incorporated comprehensive protocol details, feasibility assessments, tutorial videos, and illustrative segmentations. Through this collaborative process, consensus emerged to exclude subfield labeling in the hippocampal tail due to limited visibility of internal landmarks and substantial anatomical variability in this region. All proposed boundary guidelines were deemed clear and agreed upon via a Delphi procedure.

While this pragmatic strategy has demonstrated clinical utility, it offers limited insight into how the lDLPFC's network interactions contribute to site-dependent variability in treatment response. Here, we used connectivity-based parcellation within an lDLPFC region encompassing common TMS targets and adjacent areas to delineate functional subdivisions and characterize their connectivity to large-scale networks and behavioral associations. Our results revealed a hierarchical organization: a coarse two-pole antagonism between anterior-central and superior-posterior subregions and a finer nine-cluster architecture exposing lDLPFC's heterogeneity along anterior-posterior and ventral-dorsal axes. Anterior-central areas were strongly anti-correlated with SGC and default-mode network, positively connected with salience, dorsal attention, and control networks, and associated with cognitive control. In contrast, superior-posterior subregions displayed the inverse pattern, while ventral clusters engaged somatomotor and visual networks, and language-related processes. Central and superior-anterior clusters showed differentiated profiles, including associations with inhibition, social cognition, and perceptual functions. To aid clinical translation, we derived an lDLPFC likelihood map integrating granularities, highlighting anterior-central lDLPFC as the strongest TMS candidate considering the relevance of its connectivity and behavioral profiles to depression, while indicating that neighboring subregions have distinct functions.

One main challenge in measuring HEPs is their susceptibility to cardiac artifacts contamination, including the cardiac field artifact and the pulse artifact (PA), the latter possibly caused by the mechanical pressure of pulsating vessels. Here, we aimed at assessing the impact of PAs on HEPs and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs, a proxy of the neural responses to exteroceptive sensory stimuli). To this aim, we compared two pre-processing pipelines using independent component analysis in healthy volunteers (N=30). The first, standard, pipeline excluded ocular, muscle, sweating-related activity and cardiac-related activity stemming from the cardiac field artifact. The second, pairwise phase consistency (PPC) pipeline, in addition to the removal of the aforementioned components, used the quantitative metric of PPC between independent components and the ECG to remove the cardiac-related PA. We tested how these two pre-processing approaches influenced HEPs and AEPs recorded under diverse neurophysiological conditions (wakefulness, N2, N3, and REM sleep). Comparing the HEPs from the standard and the PPC approaches (cluster-based permutation statistics, p<0.05, two-tailed) revealed a significant effect of PAs, particularly in wakefulness, followed by REM and N2 sleep, with Cohen's d effect sizes of 1.92, 0.95 and 0.88, respectively. By contrast, PA correction had a negligible effect (p>0.05, two-tailed) on the HEPs in N3 sleep and on the AEPs in all vigilance states.

To address this, we present MExConn, the first known interpretable multi-expert U-Net architecture in the connectomics field that employs a shared encoder and multiple decoder heads to simultaneously segment multiple organelles from the same input EM image. MExConn significantly outperforms five baselines, including single-organelle model and four state of-the-art connectomics segmentation models in all evaluation metrics, reducing the Variation of Information by up to 33.54% on average across organelles. A key novelty of our approach is that MExConn offers mechanistic interpretability by revealing that the shared encoder learns shared representations essential for accurately segmenting multiple organelles. Through systematic analysis of encoder gradients with respect to each decoder output, we identify channel-wise importance profiles and reveal that many encoder channels are jointly essential for all organelles, while others are organelle-specific. Rigorous experiments on three connectomics datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MExConn in both segmentation performance and interpretability, establishing it as a principled approach for multi-organelle analysis in connectomics.

C.; Meek, K.", "abstract": "Alu elements are short repeats that occupy approximately 10% of the human genome. Saturation of primate genomes with Alu sequences occurred at the prosimian/new-world monkey evolutionary juncture. Alu elements have clearly driven unique aspects of higher primate evolution, but their presence can be detrimental to genomic stability. The expansion of Alu sequences in the genomes of higher primates precisely coincides with a substantial increase in the ubiquitous expression of the three polypeptides of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), the Ku70/80 heterodimer and DNA-PKcs. Previous work suggests that the elevated levels of Ku70/80 are required to prevent the activation of innate immune signaling pathways triggered by RNA molecules derived from Alu elements. Here we demonstrate that Ku ablation dramatically alters mRNA splicing, by allowing the use of alternative splice sites contained in intronic antisense Alu elements, which are known to directly associate with Ku70/80 5. Dysregulation of mRNA splicing precedes cell death and preferentially impacts genes involved in essential RNA metabolism processes, including splicing and ribosome biogenesis, likely impacting cell viability. In addition, we demonstrate that cell death after Ku70 depletion cannot be rescued by expression of its prosimian homologue, which suggests that primate Ku70 has evolved specific molecular features to suppress deleterious effects of an Alu element rich genome. We propose a model in which Ku binding of antisense Alu elements in introns of nascent RNAs modulates the use of alternative splice sites to balance beneficial and detrimental contributions of Alu repeats within primate genomes.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

While the six-row alleles vrs1.a2 and vrs1.a3 arose independently from point mutations in the ancestral Vrs1.b2 and Vrs1.b3 alleles, the origin of the hypothesised wild-type Vrs1.b1 allele ancestral to vrs1.a1 is unclear. To explore the origin and exploitation of VRS1 alleles, we re-sequenced VRS1 in 98 cultivars, 170 landraces and 69 wild barley accessions, identifying 39 haplotypes. Sequence analysis confirmed vrs1.a1 as the most commonly used six-row allele in European cultivars. Subsequent analysis of the landrace and wild barley data identified three occurrences of the haplotype consistent with a vrs1.b1 allele, all from wild barley. These wild barley accessions originated from the eastern Fertile Crescent (Iran) and the Caspian Sea region, suggesting vrs1.a1 arose via mutation of Vrs1.b1 within barleys domestication centre - unlike vrs1.a2 and vrs1.a3, which originated in the Western Mediterranean and East Asia cultivated barley genepools, respectively. In addition, we identified ten novel VRS1 amino acid changes in wild barley accessions, which given the pleiotropic effects of VRS1 on traits such as leaf size, vein number and tiller number, may be of interest for future functional investigation. Overall, this study provides insights into the evolution, domestication and utilisation of genetic variation at VRS1, a key gene influencing barley architecture and agricultural performance.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Classic studies visualizing RNA dynamics showed that myelin basic protein (MBP), one of the most abundant myelin proteins, is locally synthesized at the myelin sheath through the transport and local translation of Mbp mRNA. Mbp transport requires its 1.5-kb 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) and prior work identified candidate sub-sequences that may act as cis-acting transport stimulating RNA elements, including one with putative secondary structure. Here, a high-throughput reporter assay, dimethyl sulfate (DMS)-based RNA structure probing, and microscopy in primary rat oligodendrocytes identify a structured 127-nt region that we name the Mbp localization signal (MLS) as both necessary and sufficient for RNA enrichment to oligodendrocyte projections. Lysate pulldown experiments further identify hnRNP-F -- a known constituent of the Mbp RNA granule that can suppress mRNA translation -- as associated with the MLS; paradoxically, binding of this protein should compete with the ordered MLS RNA structure. These results suggest a model in which the MLS switches between two RNA conformations with distinct protein partners during the transition from Mbp mRNA transport to Mbp translation at the myelin sheath. Such regulation of RNA behavior by structure switching may generalize to other eukaryotic mRNAs whose behaviors shift across space and time.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Symmetric cell divisions are aligned by tensile stress at both the subcellular and supracellular scales, creating a globally polarized stomatal field that tracks the major axes of tissue growth. By identifying KATANIN as a critical regulator of symmetric division orientation, we show that stress-based division orientation is required to prepattern stomatal morphology and pore creation. We find that expansion of neighboring cells non-autonomously controls symmetric division orientation, linking stomatal alignment to overall leaf shape. Finally, we show that polarized stomatal fields are widespread across plant genera and their species-specific alignment patterns are consistent with the force-based mechanism we identify in Arabidopsis.

Cattle can hinder or promote recruitment, depending on the spatial, temporal, and intensity patterns of grazing. Herbivory theory predicts that repeated defoliation and trampling deplete seedling reserves, whereas resprouting can extend survival; yet field studies rarely separate intensity from recency or pair long-run grazing records with individual fates and microhabitat/climate context. 2. We test how management-driven heterogeneity shapes cork-oak (Quercus suber) seedling survival and resprouting, combining 12 years of paddock-level grazing records with individual tracking of 8431 seedlings across 24 rotational paddocks. We fitted Bayesian mixed-effects survival models relating oak seedling lifespan to grazing pressure x history (moderate [&le;] 150; high >150 LSU ha-1 days yr-1), with covariates (initial height, resprouting status, shrub distance, cattle dung counts as a proxy of very recent grazing, and 1-month SPEI as recent water balance), and Bayesian logistic mixed models relating resprouting probability to grazing treatments. 3. Survival was consistently lower in grazed than ungrazed paddocks and declined along management gradients: median lifespan fell from 460 (moderate grazing) to 256 days (high), and from 460 (old grazing; two-year exclusion) to 199 days (recent). A two-year exclusion raised survival under moderate pressure but was insufficient where pressure remained high, indicating legacy effects and that recovery windows must scale with pressure. 4. Resprouting was the dominant axis of persistence: resprouters lived >5x longer than non-resprouters (2351 vs 460 days). Taller seedlings lived longer, shrub proximity conferred a modest benefit. 5. Drought exacerbates mortality, whereas wetter recent periods (higher SPEI) markedly boosted survival. Cattle reduced the odds of resprouting, with the strongest penalty under recent use. Synthesis. By disentangling grazing intensity from recency and linking both to seedling survival and resprouting, we show why recruitment falters under continuous, heavy grazing and when it can recover. Crucially, cattle effects are exacerbated by drought periods. Management that couples moderate stocking with multi-year rest periods (long enough to rebuild bud banks and below-ground reserves) should improve regeneration in working Mediterranean woodlands.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Here we integrated contemporary field surveys with genetic barcoding, historic surveys, museum collections, and fossil records to document changes in the rocky shore gastropod communities along 8 degrees of latitude (approximately 3,120 km of coastline) of the Baja California Peninsula. We detected poleward range expansions of 30 tropical and subtropical species, and trailing-edge retractions of 13 temperate species, with some range shifts occurring across long-standing biogeographic boundaries. Fossil evidence reveals that several range-extending species previously occupied latitudes beyond their modern distributions during Pleistocene warm periods, suggesting that contemporary expansions echo historical responses to climatic warming, albeit under accelerated rates. Using Lottia gigantea as a case study, we demonstrated early range retractions can be marked by shifts in size-frequency distributions demonstrating declines in abundance, and loss of small individuals suggestive of reduced recruitment. We showed that rocky intertidal systems are sensitive to climate-driven range shifts, and highlighted the importance of integrating historical, palaeontological and contemporary data to detect early ecological and evolutionary consequences of tropicalisation.

This however varies depending on data source, smoothing methodology or date- extraction method. The selection of an appropriate phenological processing pipeline for the system of study thus requires accurate benchmarking in a controlled environment. 2. In this study we use a Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate ecosystem dynamics at four temperate forest sites under five lesser studied climate perturbations. We use the generated synthetic dataset to control for environmental conditions while testing commonly used phenological detection methods (relative thresholds at 10%, 20% and 50%, highest rate of change, detection of inflection points in the curvature's angle, detection of recovery and senescence points). 3. Amongst tested methods, we find general agreement in terms of response to climate alterations. Inflection and low thresholds (10%) methods provide the closest match to the model's predicted start of season, with a maximum discrepancy of 4 days between the two. Higher thresholds (20%, 50%) are closer to the models' predicted end of season, although with discrepancies of up to 10 days. In addition, high thresholds and methods based on the rate of change of vegetation parameters successfully detect the peak of season. We also show how some methods can pick up on effects that are ignored by temperature-only type growing seasons, thereby supporting the need for increased realism of phenological representations in land surface models. 4.

We fine-tune BirdAVES for recognizing 173 zebra finch individuals from short (1-3 s) clips using a concise training recipe: two-phase training, weighted sampling and class-weighted cross-entropy for long-tailed counts, and a supervised contrastive term to pull same-individual embeddings together. On a real-world dataset (2,915 clips, 173 individuals), the selected model achieved macro-F1 = 0.733 (val) / 0.726 (test) and steep retrieval gains (Top-5 = 0.868, Top-10 = 0.893 on test set).

Their seasonality is primarily driven by variations in temperature and humidity, which also play a key role in shaping outbreak dynamics. Yet, despite numerous studies estimating the substitution rates of different Influenza A subtypes, it remains unclear whether these rates change over time in response to shifting climate conditions. To address this outstanding question, we collected genomic sequences of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes for both H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes circulating worldwide. Keeping only sequences from countries with records spanning at least 2 decades, we performed a Bayesian analysis to estimate substitution rates. We show that substitution rate is driven by temperature for both subtypes and genes for multiple countries (Australia, China, Japan, Netherland, Russia, Thailand, U.S.A.). When it is not the case, a power analysis indicates a potential lack of sequences to detect the effect.

Mushifugu (Takifugu exascurus) is a pufferfish endemic to Japan's coastal waters and is characterized by conspicuous labyrinthine patterns. Despite being recorded along both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts, it has a limited distribution and is infrequently observed. Aside from its unique body pattern, mushifugu shows little to no morphological differences from other Takifugu species, often leading to speculation that it may be an interspecific hybrid. In addition, previous theoretical and empirical studies have shown that complex camouflage-like labyrinthine patterns can emerge through the 'pattern blending' caused by hybridization between spotted species, providing support for this possibility. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic origin of mushifugu and its distinctive pattern through population structure analysis and demographic inference in comparison with its closest spotted relative, komonfugu (T. flavipterus). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis revealed two regional haplogroups within mushifugu--one in the Sea of Japan (SJ) and the other in the Pacific Ocean (PO). In the haplotype network, the SJ haplogroup formed a distinct cluster, whereas the PO haplogroup appeared as its own cluster connected to the komonfugu haplogroup. By contrast, genome-wide SNP analyses indicated limited structure between the SJ and PO mushifugu populations, while clearly separating mushifugu from komonfugu. Coalescent-based demographic inference suggested that the two species diverged following a bottleneck event in the early Pleistocene. These results confirm that mushifugu is a distinct species rather than a recent interspecific hybrid. Nevertheless, evidence of introgression was detected in both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, suggesting multiple episodes of past hybridization between mushifugu and komonfugu, highlighting the potentially complex evolutionary processes shaping Takifugu species and their pigment patterns.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Disgust reduces pathogen exposure through avoidance, whereas fear promotes vigilance and escape from predators. While cognitive mechanisms of fear have been extensively studied, those underlying disgust remain less understood, particularly in nonhuman animals. We examined how cues of disease and predation risk influence cognitive processes in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In three touchscreen experiments, subjects performed a number ordering task while exposed to disgust-related images (carcasses, rotten food, disease-associated invertebrates), pathogen-related odors (cadaverine, butyric acid) or fear-related images (snakes). Task performance was assessed via accuracy (proportion of correct trials), reactivity (latency to touch the first numeral), and efficiency (latency to complete trials). We found that disgust cues -- particularly those related to body decomposition and food spoilage -- modulated task performance in distinct temporal patterns. Carcass images reduced accuracy relative to invertebrate images and slowed performance compared to snake images, while butyric acid -- and to a lower extent cadaverine -- initially facilitated but later disrupted efficiency upon re-exposure. In contrast, snake images enhanced performance by reducing latencies. To test whether these effects reflected differences in visual attention, we conducted a fourth eye-tracking experiment with new carcass and snake images. Both types of stimuli captured and held attention, partly echoing human data showing sustained attention to snakes but typically not to disgust images.

These behaviours may arise from either adaptive or nonadaptive processes. Over shorter timescales, SSB can occur when courtship costs are low or when missing a mating opportunity is costly, leading to a reduced behavioural threshold for courtship - a 'broad mating filter,' as predicted by threshold acceptance theory. We investigated SSB in males of the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens (Gravenhorst, 1829, Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), a species where encounters are infrequent and male courtship is energetically not costly. We hypothesised that males exhibit a broad mating filter, accepting conspecifics for courtship regardless of sex. First, behavioural assays assessed whether SSB correlated with higher reproductive success. Second, we compared cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles between sexes, as these compounds may serve as cues for sex recognition. Our chemical analyses revealed clear quantitative CHC differences between males and females, indicating potential for sex recognition. Nonetheless, 18% of males displayed SSB, and these behaviours had no detectable effect on either courting or mating success. Moreover, males receiving SSB did not experience any reproductive advantage. Our findings support the hypothesis of a broad mating filter in V. canescens males. In this species, where conspecific encounters are rare, SSB appears to arise from reduced discrimination rather than adaptive benefits, consistent with a low-cost courtship strategy and high opportunity costs of missed mating events.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

MembraneBuilder [1] speeds up the generation of these membranes by simplifying the lipid insertion process, which allows membranes to be generated for these larger systems. Realistic lipid densities and elimination of infinite forces caused by overlapping atoms are achieved at a low computational cost. See Figure 1 for specific time comparisons. The comparisons emphasize that not only does MembraneBuilder run orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art programs [2, 3, 4], it enables generation of systems several orders of magnitude larger. MembraneBuilder enables customizable embedding of proteins into a membrane. Users can modify lipid types and their ratios, the location to insert the membrane, the size of the membrane box, as well as the lipid density. The program reduces the computational time required to perform a membrane embedding by bypassing many of the computationally expensive steps, such as identification of polar/non-polar sections of the protein and exhaustive packing of the lipids into the membrane with the intent to avoid steric clashes. Efficient packing begins with constricting the lipid bonds by a given factor in x, y, and z directions before inserting them on a grid. Grid spacing is determined by the width of the constricted lipids. The grid spacing is smaller than in other lipid-generation tools due to the constriction process. The constricted bonds will relax and the lipids will assume realistic interweaving during energy minimization and equilibration.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Ent5 condensation is driven by a dynamic helix within its disordered region that acts as a molecular sticker. Deletion of this helix disrupts membrane-associated condensation and leads to altered cargo trafficking dynamics in vivo, with Ent5-dependent transport events becoming delayed. In contrast, Sla2 behaves both as a driver and as a client of LLPS, with its coiled-coil (CC) region mediating condensation.

Attractive coupling from the core to shell regions accounts for experimentally observed phase relationships between these regions under LD cycles.

Specifically, MEP amplitudes increased across trials for ISIs of 20 and 30 ms (p<0.05), but remained stable at LICI-related ISIs (100-150 ms). A similar increase was also seen with single-pulse TMS. These findings demonstrate that suprathreshold paired-pulse TMS at short ISIs can cumulatively enhance corticospinal excitability during stimulation. Furthermore, the results suggest potential for using these protocols not just for probing cortical circuits, but also as interventions to modulate motor system excitability.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

This study investigated age-dependent effects of paraquat-induced Parkinsonism on serum a-syn expression, substantia nigra histoarchitecture, and neurobehavior in male Wistar rats. Methods Sixty-three male Wistar rats were stratified into juvenile, young-adult, and adult cohorts and assigned to control, paraquat, or PQ+Recovery groups (n = 7). Paraquat (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered twice weekly for three weeks; recovery animals were monitored for two months. Neurobehavioral tests including hanging wire, open field, and Y-maze were conducted at baseline, post-exposure, and post-recovery. Serum and substantia nigra a-syn were quantified using ELISA, and histology assessed cytoarchitectural changes. Data were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA (p is less than or equal to 0.05). Results Neurobehavioral outcomes showed no significant differences in spontaneous alternation across cohorts. Latency-to-fall remained stable in young-adult and juvenile rats but declined in adult PQ+Recovery animals (p = 0.05). Line crossings decreased in adult paraquat rats (p = 0.02). Urine pools decreased significantly in young-adult paraquat (p = 0.0010) and PQ+Recovery groups (p = 0.0016), with group effects in young-adult (p = 0.007) and juvenile cohorts (p = 0.047). Substantia nigra a-syn showed no significant differences (p > 0.22); serum a-syn differed in young adults (p = 0.039), with reduced levels in the recovery group (p = 0.047). Histology revealed paraquat-induced neuronal degeneration which was most severe in adults, and partial structural restoration after recovery period. Conclusion Paraquat induces mild, age-dependent neurotoxic effects, with adults showing the greatest vulnerability. Differential serum a-syn responses and histological findings highlight developmental stage as a key modulator of susceptibility and recovery following environmental neurotoxin exposure.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Participants demonstrated robust sensitivity to fairness in the Ultimatum Game. A whole-brain psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that connectivity between the posterior temporoparietal junction (pTPJ) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during unfair offers from a human partner was moderated by the interaction between Autism Quotient (AQ) scores and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) response to betrayal in the Trust Game. Individuals with higher AQ showed distinct patterns of pTPJ-dlPFC coupling depending on their neural sensitivity to trust violations.

We analyzed rectal swab microbiota compositions before and after 48 weeks' supplementation with high-dose vitamin D and calcium, or placebo, embedded in a randomized controlled trial conducted in Zambia and Zimbabwe (Pan African Clinical Trials Registry PACTR20200989766029). In a sub-cohort of 244 participants, we first assessed baseline associations of the rectal swab microbiota with vitamin D metabolites, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and bone mineral density (BMD). We then analyzed longitudinal changes in rectal swab microbiota and intestinal barrier integrity during supplementation and examined whether the baseline microbiota influenced the treatment response. At baseline, anaerobic taxa within the class Clostridia were positively associated with PTH, 1,25(OH)2D, and BMD, and negatively associated with 24,25(OH)2D. After supplementation, Shannon diversity was decreased ({beta}Std=-0.495, CI [ 0.802, 0.188], p=0.0018), median Bray-Curtis dissimilarity from baseline samples was increased ({beta}Std=0.399, CI [0.086, 0.712], p=0.013), and abundance of Clostridia_vadinBB60_group was decreased (log2fc=-1.715, CI [ 2.596, -0.835], q=0.043) in the intervention arm. The intervention did not affect the intestinal barrier integrity, measured by intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) concentration in blood plasma. On average, PTH concentrations decreased and BMD increased during supplementation. However, higher baseline abundance of Clostridia-member UCG-009 predicted a smaller reduction in PTH concentrations during supplementation (log2fcstd=1.200 CI [0.656, 1.744], q=0.012), while higher baseline abundances of Enterococcus (log2fcstd=-1.220 CI [-1.807, -0.632], q=0.022) and Fournierella (log2fcstd=-1.122 CI [-1.694, -0.551], q=0.025) predicted a smaller increase in BMD.

Most CAUTIs are polymicrobial with resilient communities maintaining a consistent composition of species over time, despite antibiotic treatment and catheter replacement. However, the mechanisms promoting persistence are poorly understood. Here we examine how a chemical interaction between Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae can explain their high rate of co-occurrence on long-term indwelling urinary catheters. Sequence analyses of longitudinal isolates from several human patients co-infected with E. faecalis and K. pneumoniae revealed that despite frequent replacement, catheters became re-colonized with the same or a nearly identical consortium of strains throughout the study collection period. Using artificial urine medium (AUM), monoculture revealed that the K. pneumoniae isolates grew robustly and formed biofilm, while the E. faecalis isolates grew poorly and did not form biofilm. However, co-culture of paired isolates resulted in enhanced E. faecalis growth and biofilm, which could be reproduced by supplementing E. faecalis with cell-free K. pneumoniae conditioned AUM supernatant (KpAUMSup). Analyses using comparative transcriptomics, mutant strains and chemical inhibitors with cell culture and murine CAUTI models revealed that: i) KpAUMSup, but not AUM, stimulated expression of the E. faecalis Fsr quorum-sensing system; ii) Fsr was required for E. faecalis to respond to KpAUMSup; iii) E. faecalis cultured in KpAUMSup was more efficient in initiating CAUTI; and iv) Disruption of Fsr inhibited initiation of CAUTI.

Ecological communities are complex and exhibit considerable spatial variability, presenting challenges in accurately understanding these systems. A primary obstacle in ecological research is the existence of missing links between species: inevitable unobserved interactions that limit our comprehension of ecological networks and their response to change. While link prediction methods have been developed to address this challenge, most approaches overlook the intrinsic spatial variability of ecological systems. 2. We introduce a flexible, spatially explicit framework based on matrix decomposition that leverages latent structural patterns to predict missing interactions and their strength, without requiring species traits or environmental data. The framework integrates information from paired auxiliary and target networks (locations) using thresholded SVD for link prediction. We applied it to plant-pollinator networks across the Canary Islands, performing pairwise predictions between locations, comparing them to within-location predictions (as a control), and quantifying how spatial variability influences predictive performance. 3. Predictions revealed that latent network structure contains substantial predictive information, with F1 scores consistently exceeding a random baseline, while being less sensitive to interaction strength. The method enabled identifying plausible gaps in the data and producing ecologically coherent predictions. Incorporating information from auxiliary locations enhanced predictive accuracy in certain cases, but success depended critically on spatial context: predictions were most reliable when derived from nearby, ecologically similar sites or islands with larger networks, and declined with increasing geographic and ecological distance, demonstrating a clear distance-decay effect. 4. We conclude that the predictability of missing links is spatially variable, reflecting both network and species-level heterogeneity. These patterns provide insights into network structure and the ecological processes shaping it, complementing trait-based approaches. While network structure offers rich predictive information, spatial context is essential for applying it effectively: ignoring spatial variability can obscure ecological signals and inflate predictive error. Our framework is computationally efficient, transferable, and readily applicable to any system with spatial or temporal replication. It can be used for a variety of across ecological contexts, including island systems, fragmented landscapes, and environmental gradients, making it a practical and scalable tool for advancing link prediction in ecology.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

However, a detailed understanding of their mechanical interaction with penile tissues remains limited. Aim To develop and validate an innovative experimental computational framework for studying IPP behaviour through ex vivo implantation and inflation testing in human cadaveric penile tissue, paired with a finite element based (FE based) computational model. Methods An AMS 700 IPP was surgically implanted into a human cadaveric penis (including the glans and 15 cm of shaft) using standard clinical techniques. The cylinders were placed within the corpora cavernosa, with the pump and reservoir positioned externally in a closed hydraulic loop. An inflation test was performed ex vivo, with real-time ultrasound imaging used to monitor cylinder expansion. Internal pressure was recorded using a digital barometer. Following inflation, sectional analysis enabled 3D approximation of penile shaft geometry. A representative FE-based computational model was developed, incorporating anatomically accurate tissue layers, tunica albuginea (TA), corpus cavernosa (CC), corpus spongiosum (CS), and fascia, with realistic material properties to simulate the inflation process. Outcomes This study enabled the mechanical response of penile tissues to IPP inflation to be quantified using both experimental and computational modalities. Results The combined use of ultrasound imaging and digital pressure monitoring successfully captured dynamic IPP behaviour during inflation. The FE model reproduced experimental outcomes with good fidelity, providing a detailed understanding of stress distribution and tissue deformation. Clinical Implications This integrated approach can inform future IPP design improvements and aid surgeons in preoperative planning by offering predictive insights into prosthesis tissue interaction. Strengths & Limitations A major strength of this study is the novel integration of cadaveric experimentation with computational modelling. However, limitations include the absence of active physiological responses and potential variability due to cadaveric tissue properties.

Their essential roles in plant development, organ polarity, meristem maintenance, and vascular differentiation have been well established. However, their role in storage organ development, particularly in potato tuberization remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate the pleiotropic effects of miR166 on potato (Solanum tuberosum spp. Andigena) growth and development. Suppression of miR166 via target mimicry (MIM166) resulted in reduced plant height, altered vascular patterning, diminished leaf curvature, and impaired root development. Remarkably, MIM166 lines produced elongated, pigmented tubers with reduced yield under short-day conditions. Transcriptomic analyses of swollen head versus stalk of tuberizing stolons revealed altered expression of auxin-, cytokinin-, and gibberellin-related genes, consistent with hormone quantification data, suggesting the key role of phytohormones in governing tuber shape. Anthocyanin profiling indicated elevated accumulation of cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, and delphinidin 3-glucoside in MIM166 tuber peels, correlating with the upregulation of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Tuber productivity in these lines was reduced possibly due to the decreased expression of SWEET11b and distorted vascular structures in the MIM166 lines. Further, StREVOLUTA, a direct miR166 target, exhibited dynamic expression during stolon differentiation and could modulate the expression of auxin biosynthesis genes. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the miR166-HD-ZIP III module is functional in potato, plays conserved roles in regulating key developmental traits, and is active through early stolon-to-tuber transition stages, affecting tuber shape, color and productivity.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

The aim of this study is to determine whether IgG autoantibodies from long COVID patients with neurological sequelae can bind to central or peripheral nervous system epitopes and triggers neuropsychiatric symptoms upon passive transfer into mice, thereby mirroring patient-reported manifestations. Long COVID patients meeting the 2021 consensus WHO definition were included following a standardized neuropsychological assessment, while excluding patients with a medical history of autoimmune and neurological disorders. Age- and sex-matched asymptomatic individuals were used as healthy controls. Total IgGs were isolated using protein G purification and injected intraperitoneally into C57Bl6/J mice for four consecutive days. During the two weeks post-injections, behavioral tests assessed mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, spatial working memory, depression, and anxiety. Mice injected with IgG from long COVID patients showed no difference with the control group in terms of anxiety or depression behaviors, as well as no impairment of short- or long-term spatial memories and thermal hyperalgesia. However, they displayed a transient decrease of paw withdrawal threshold during the first week. This effect was abolished when IgG-depleted serum or papain-digested IgGs were transferred. IgG from long COVID patients accumulated in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of injected mice and colocalized with proprioceptive and nociceptive sensory neurons, without inducing local neuroinflammation or astrogliosis. These data demonstrate that IgGs from long COVID patients bind to peripheral sensory neurons and induce pain-related symptoms in mice. Our findings also support the hypothesis that autoantibodies mediate pain-related pathophysiology in the spectrum of long COVID symptoms.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax/Takeda adopted monovalent LP.8.1 for their 2025-2026 season vaccines, following recommendations issued by the WHO in May 2025. As of November 2025, SARS-CoV-2 variants including LP.8.1, XEC, NB.1.8.1, and XFG, all designated as variants under monitoring, were circulating. In terms of the spike gene, these recent variants as well as LP.8.1 are derived from JN.1. Moreover, BA.3.2, a BA.3 descendant with multiple mutations in the spike gene, has recently emerged and exhibits robust immune evasion. In Japan, the rollout of the LP.8.1-based vaccination has progressed since the end of September 2025. We previously reported the humoral immunity induced by the XBB.1.5-based monovalent vaccine in 2023 and the JN.1-based monovalent vaccine in 2024 in the Japanese population. Here, we investigated the efficiency of humoral immunity induced by two LP.8.1-based vaccines, the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech and the recombinant protein-based vaccine from Novavax/Takeda, in Japan. We performed neutralization assays using sera obtained from individuals who received the LP.8.1 mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech (N=29) or the LP.8.1 recombinant protein vaccine from Novavax/Takeda (N=20) with pseudoviruses harboring spike proteins of B.1.1, BA.5, XBB.1.5, JN.1, LP.8.1, XEC, NB.1.8.1, XFG and BA.3.2. In both mRNA and protein-based vaccinee groups, the change in 50% neutralizing titer (NT50) against variants that were predominant before JN.1 (i.e., B.1.1, BA.5 and XBB.1.5) were smaller than those against JN.1 and its subvariants, including LP.8.1, XEC, NB.1.8.1 and XFG. Consistent with recent studies, neutralizing antibodies against BA.3.2 were induced by both vaccines. However, the induction fold change of BA.3.2 was smaller than those of JN.1 and its subvariants. Next, we tested humoral immune response of participants who received both JN.1-based vaccine in 2024 and LP.8.1-based vaccine in 2025 (N=15). Approximately a year after the JN.1-based vaccination, neutralization titer has waned against all variants tested. However, when we compare the NT50s of pre-vaccination sera between 2025 and 2024, those in 2025 against all variants except for B.1.1 were significantly higher than those last year. This suggests that the cross-neutralizing antibodies induced by JN.1-based vaccination were still maintained for a year. Furthermore, the neutralization abilities against the JN.1 sublineages tested and BA.3.2 were significantly reboosted after the LP.8.1-based vaccination. Our study shows immune boosting by the LP.8.1-based vaccine is effective in achieving cross-neutralization against a broad range of JN.1 sublineages in a JN.1-naive population and in recalling waning humoral immunity against these subvariants.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Unique morphological characteristics included the production of elongated, thick, nucleated structures in GX isolates, the formation of thin hair-like projections on sporangial walls in SR isolates, and irregularly shaped sporangia in TM isolates. All strains grew optimally at 32-35 {degrees}C and showed distinct substrate utilization capacity (e.g., growth on pectin, chitin, galactose). LSU analyses revealed GX isolates as the first cultured representatives of tortoise-affiliated but previously uncultured lineage NY56, while SR and TM strains have not been encountered in prior culture-independent AGF surveys. We propose to accommodate these isolates in three new genera and species: Gopheromyces tardescens (GXA2), Gigasporangiomyces pilosus (SR0.6), and Kelyphomyces adhaerens (TM0.3). Further, based on the ecological, physiological, and phylogenetic distinctions between T-AGF and M-AGF, we propose to establish a new family (Testudinimycetaceae) to accommodate the genera Testudinimyces, Gopheromyces, Gigasporangiomyces, and Kelyphomyces, within a new order (Testudinimycetales), and amend the description of Neocallimastigales to circumscribe M-AGF genera only.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Here, using the mammary gland as a model, we identified a novel intermediate cell state essential for basal-to-luminal differentiation during regeneration. The transcription factor Pou2f3 is a master regulator of this state, critical for regeneration but dispensable for organ physiology. Mechanistically, we found that POU2F3 functions as a transcriptional repressor that drives lineage conversion by restricting chromatin accessibility of basal genes rather than by directly activating luminal programs. Furthermore, we uncovered a POU2F3-TNF feedback loop that maintains epithelial homeostasis, where TNF signaling suppresses Pou2f3 to inhibit differentiation, and loss of luminal cells relieves this repression to trigger regeneration. Strikingly, cell fate is governed by signaling pathways essential for cell-cell communication during development, but by Pou2f3-dependent chromatin remodeling for rapid response and injury repair. We validate the regeneration-specific requirement for Pou2f3 in mammary gland and further demonstrate analogous regeneration defects in prostate and pancreas. These findings challenge the long-held assumption that regeneration recapitulates development and establish a framework for understanding context-specific mechanisms of tissue plasticity, with implications for regenerative medicine and epithelial biology.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Previous studies identified osm-11 (which encodes a Notch co-ligand) mutations as a driver of hyper-saline tolerance in Caenorhabditis elegans, but mechanistic insights remained unclear. This study employs RNA sequencing and CRISPR/Cas-9 genome editing to demonstrate that osm-11 mutations enhance salinity stress resistance through up-regulation of fatty acid metabolism (acdh-12, acs-17) and cytochrome P450 pathways (ugt-15), while suppressing calcium signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that acdh-12 mutation impairs salinity-stress tolerance by activating ferroptosis and mitophagy, accompanied by down-regulated oxidative phosphorylation and up-regulated autophagic pathways. Morphological observations show that mitochondrial fragmentation contributes to wild-type nematode mortality under high salinity, while enlarged lipid droplets in wild-types correlate with reduced {beta}-oxidation gene expression (dhs-28, daf-22), whose knockout disrupts tolerance in mutants. These findings unravel the multi-pathway regulatory network of osm-11-mediated salinity tolerance, providing mechanistic insights for developing protective strategies against environmental salinity stressors impacting animal survival.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

This pathway functionally couples the dynamics of two key loops at the active site, and its integrity is crucial for enzymatic efficiency. Our analysis of the apo enzyme's conformational free energy landscape reveals that this allostery is part of a cooperative global network, leading to distinct, slowly interconverting conformational states.

Sounds can hit both the external and internal surfaces of the tympanic membranes, providing mechanical directional sensitivity for sound localization. This coupling may also give rise to binaural synchronization. In other words, each inner ear could influence the function of the other. Previous work in lizards demonstrates that binaural coupling affects the spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) measured at each external auditory meatus, with properties indicative of binaural synchronization. However, it is unclear how binaural coupling and, consequently, synchronization contribute to SOAE generation, which is typically modelled as being localized to an individual ear. We simultaneously measured SOAEs at both ears of green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and found robust relationships between them, including evidence that binaural synchronization could not be attributed to one ear uniformly driving the other. Instead, we observed frequency-dependent phase-locking between the two ears, primarily at frequencies where SOAE peaks occurred in both ears. While some pairs of ears were more strongly synchronized than others, we consistently found that binaural coupling could have greater effects on the resulting emissions than the coupling between generators within the same ear. We propose a framework for active hearing that incorporates binaural coupling, accounting for its effects on SOAE generation and sound localization in the green anole.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we use differentiated primary human nasal epithelial cell (NEC) cultures to compare an ancestral isolate (QLD02) to Omicron variants BA.1, BA.5 and XBB. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that BA.5 and XBB infection, unlike BA.1 and QLD02, drives a distinct host response, defined by the profound downregulation of genes essential for cilium assembly and function at 48-hours post-infection. The BA.5 and XBB signature was also characterized by the strong upregulation of pro-apoptotic and inflammatory pathways. Immunofluorescence (IF) of nucleocapsid-positive cells in NECs showed a significant 13-fold increase for BA.5 and 9-fold increase for BA.1 relative to QLD02. Additionally, BA.1 and BA.5 exhibited greater tropism (7.6-fold for BA.1, 9-fold for BA.5) for ciliated cells compared to QLD02. Finally, while BA.5 and BA.1 infection was associated with widespread apoptosis in both infected and bystander cells, the total number of ciliated cells remained unchanged.

When given a choice between two identical liquid food sources (feeders or traps containing sugar solutions), wild hornets distributed asymmetrically on the two options, and this phenomenon was more frequent as group size increased. Priming one of the food sources with dead hornets predictably biased the collective choices towards this particular option, irrespective of whether the dead insects were conspecifics or hornets from a closely related species.

Excitation of its neutral phenolic ground state chromophore populates an emissive anionic phenolate state via excited state proton transfer (ESPT) to E222 along a molecular wire. Computational studies indicate that ESPT fits to an electronically adiabatic rate expression. Although reactions that operate close to the adiabatic limit can be sensitive to environmental dipolar relaxation, little is known about the role of such relaxation during ESPT in GFP. Here, we present the first experimental evidence that dipolar relaxation of the protein matrix occurs during ESPT in response to the change in electron density distribution in the excited state GFP chromophore and is a key determinant of the reaction pathway. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we excited along the red edge of the neutral phenolic ground state absorption band of several GFP variants with differing chromophore environments. Instead of resulting in a significant red shift of the centre of spectral mass (CSM) of the emission spectra common for biological chromophores such as tryptophan, the CSM of each GFP variant remains almost unchanged as a function of excitation wavelength. This is consistent with each sub-population that is selectively excited along the red edge reaching the same, fully relaxed state before emission of a photon. The kinetics of environmental dipolar relaxation are therefore on the same sub-nanosecond timescale as ESPT, which provides an explanation for its adiabatic nature and could inform the rational design of novel fluorescent proteins with tailored photophysics.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

This study investigates the role of the E3 ubiquitin-ligase Hakai, the first identified post-translational regulator of E-cadherin stability, in promoting CSC traits in colorectal cancer (CRC). To examine Hakai's involvement in CSC regulation, we used an inducible shRNA in a HT29 cells. Under conditions that promote CSC characteristics, we silenced Hakai and evaluated tumoursphere formation and CSC marker expression. Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify Hakai-regulated proteins in tumoursphere cultures. Additionally, Western blot, RT-qPCR, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and TOPFlash assays were employed to study CSC-related protein regulation in response to Hakai expression. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of Hakin-1, the pharmacological inhibitor specifically targeting Hakai's HYB domain responsible for its E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity, on tumoursphere properties. Hakai silencing significantly reduced tumoursphere size and number accompanied by decreased expression of CSC markers and Wnt target genes. CSC-related proteins regulated by Hakai were identified, including LRP4, a negative regulator of Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway. Hakai interacts with LRP4, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, Hakai overexpression induces hyperactivation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin sand disrupts LRP4's inhibitory effect. Treatment with Hakin-1 effectively inhibited self-renewal and promoted differentiation within tumourspheres.

M.", "abstract": "Despite its central role in development, cell homeostasis, and cancer, the mechanisms that induce and transduce Wnt signaling, particularly the role and impact of receptor internalization, have been under discussion for almost two decades. To integrate seemingly contradictory experimental observations into a coherent explanatory framework, we developed a mechanistic computational model that dissects the spatiotemporal regulation of canonical Wnt signaling. For this, a newly optimized multi-level rule-based modeling and simulation approach is employed to describe and simulate the compartmental distribution of extracellular, intracellular, and membrane-associated signaling molecules, as well as a concise representation of the receptor life cycle, including internalization, degradation, and recycling processes. Our simulations show that cells can compensate for the partial immobilization of receptor complexes by internalization (the movement of molecules into the cell) and rapid recycling (the return of these molecules to the cell membrane). This process ensures the formation of larger and more stable protein-receptor complexes (signalosomes) and the continuation of the signaling process. Our results imply that degradation and recycling are essentially required for stable, long-term signaling (in terms of beta-catenin aggregation). This process is often overlooked in its importance for stable, long-term signal maintenance, and it provides a possible explanation for why excessive signal activation in cancer cells is highly dependent on internalization and recycling processes. Having integrated the concept of rebinding (the process by which proteins return to their original location) and residence time (how long a protein stays in a particular location), the model illustrates the pivotal role of ordered membrane domains (lipid rafts) in the recruitment of proteins such as DVL (Disheveled) to the membrane and their aggregation. This study highlights the complex interplay of cellular processes involved in Wnt signaling, including lateral diffusion, internalization, recycling, and the role of ordered membrane domains. Integrating such a multitude of experimental measurements based on varying cell lines/tissues, experimental approaches, and treatments into a simulation model enables comprehensive and in-depth insights into the mechanistic regulation of canonical Wnt signaling, which will open up new possibilities for modulating Wnt signaling in disease contexts.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

The mechanical properties of the spindle and the forces driving its elongation remain poorly defined. Here, we analyzed how spindles react to mechanical and genetic perturbations to uncover their mechanical properties. Treatment of cells with osmotic oscillations and blue light led to a consistent phenotype of spindle buckling and breakage in mid-anaphase. The stalling of pole separation and reduced rates of spindle elongation indicated that spindles elongate and buckle under increased mechanical load. The structural integrity of the bent spindles was dependent on Ase1 (PRC1), while the spindle elongation rate was dependent on motor proteins Klp9 (kinesin-6) and Cut7 (kinesin-5). Modeling of bent spindle shapes revealed that most spindles behave mechanically as a beam with a two-fold increase in rigidity in the midzone. Upon reaching a threshold size, bent spindles broke at a specific fragile site near the edge of the spindle midzone.

Here we introduce a trophodynamic index that anticipates adult invertebrate population fluctuations by tracking material flows through the pelagic food web during the dispersal and early growth period. Combining primary production with the slope of zooplankton size spectra, the index reflects both productivity and trophic transfer efficiency. Applied to Bermuda's Caribbean spiny lobster population, which supports both commercial and recreational fisheries that have steadily declined over the last decade, ecological forecasts based on this trophodynamic index outperform climatological, persistence, and environment-based models. This framework links pelagic ecosystem processes to invertebrate population dynamics, improving predictive capacity and supporting the development of ecosystem-based management for small-scale fisheries.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Evolutionarily young sex chromosomes, such as those found in the flowering plant Rumex hastatulus, can provide insights into the early stages of this process. Using a new high-quality genome assembly with a well-assembled Y chromosome and a highly replicated transcriptome dataset, we found widespread underexpression of Y genes compared to their homologous counterparts on the X chromosome. We also found evidence for increased expression differences for more distantly diverged gametologs, suggestive of progressive loss of expression of Y linked genes over time. Genes with greater expression loss on the Y chromosome also showed elevated rates of protein evolution, as expected if silencing alleles mask the effects of deleterious mutations on the Y and/or if selective interference drives early degeneration in regulatory sequences. However, in contrast with the predictions of recent models of sex chromosome expansion and degeneration by regulatory evolution, there was no evidence of early dosage compensation. Overall, we conclude that in Rumex Hill-Robertson interference alone may be the main driver of Y chromosome degeneration, although further understanding of the temporal order of regulatory changes could help further untangle cause and effect.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

H.; Lieb, K.; Engelmann, J.; Zillich, L.", "abstract": "Background: Although antidepressants remain the main pharmacological treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), therapeutic response is highly variable, highlighting the need for reliable markers that predict and mechanistically explain treatment outcomes. Previous candidate-gene and cross-sectional epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have suggested DNA methylation signatures associated with antidepressant response; however, findings are inconsistent. To date, no longitudinal EWAS has systematically examined dynamic methylation changes across multiple time points during antidepressant treatment to identify early epigenetic markers of response. Methods: Within the Early Medication Change trial, DNA methylation data was generated for 162 patients with MDD (81 responders, 81 non-responders) and 48 matched healthy controls. Patient samples were collected at four time points during eight weeks of standardized antidepressant treatment, and controls were assessed twice. Longitudinal EWASs were performed to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using the comb-p algorithm. Results: Baseline methylation was associated with treatment outcome at day 56 through six DMRs (e.g., TNRC6C, CAT, CCNY), whereas no DMP reached significance. Longitudinal analyses identified one DMP linked to clinical improvement (YLMP1) and three DMRs with time effects (GPR126, C20orf54, PM20D1). Combined patient-control analyses revealed additional DMPs and DMRs associated with diagnosis and temporal changes. Conclusions: This study provides the first longitudinal evidence of dynamic, regionally coordinated methylation changes during antidepressant pharmacotherapy in MDD. These alterations occur in genes involved in neuroplasticity and inflammation and are linked to clinical response. Defining such methylation signatures as predictive or mechanistic markers could advance personalized treatment strategies for MDD, though replication and functional validation in larger cohorts remain essential.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

However, there is little evidence that innate immune mechanisms control Mtb before the onset of adaptive immunity. Prior work has generally used specific pathogen-free (SPF) mouse models and relatively large infectious doses, which may obscure the capacity of innate immunity to control Mtb. Here, we performed ultra-low dose Mtb infections and found that the initial innate immune response was unable to curb even minimal Mtb infectious doses. Additionally, we primed the immune systems of C57BL/6 mice by co-housing with \"pet shop\" mice prior to Mtb exposure. Co-housed mice were as susceptible to Mtb infection as SPF mice. To more specifically pre-activate innate immunity at the site of Mtb infection, we also infected the lungs of mice with Legionella pneumophila (Lp) prior to Mtb. Innate immunity alone can clear large doses (>100,000 CFU) of Lp from the lung within a few days. However, pre-infection with Lp only modestly reduced Mtb CFU compared to mice infected with only Mtb, indicating that Mtb can robustly replicate even in the presence of a strong innate inflammatory response. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on myeloid cells from mice either infected with Mtb alone or mice primed with Lp. We found that Lp priming before Mtb infection induced measurable changes in myeloid cells responding to Mtb, but these changes had little effect on innate control of Mtb.

Intriguingly, A. aegypti sustains persistent DENV infection without exhibiting apparent pathology, indicating a highly adapted and regulated host-virus relationship. However, the temporal gene expression dynamics that govern this finely balanced interaction remain poorly understood. We performed a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis using 12 paired-end RNA-seq datasets from gene expression omnibus (GEO; GSE222893), comparing naive and DENV-infected A. aegypti samples at Days 1, 2, and 7 post-infection. A robust bioinformatics pipeline (STAR [-&gt;] FeatureCounts [-&gt;] DESeq2 [-&gt;] g:Profiler) was employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), explore functional annotations, and resolve temporal patterns via principal component analysis. Finally, a molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) was performed to check the molecular stability of the highly expressed gene. Our temporal analysis identified LOC5570687, a gene encoding a serine-type endopeptidase, as the most significantly differentially expressed transcript across all infection time points. Functional annotation confirmed its role in proteolysis, implicating it in the cleavage of flaviviral polyproteins, a critical step in viral replication. Principal component analysis revealed distinct transcriptional divergence at Day 1, immune modulation at Day 2, and convergence by Day 7--marking virion maturation. Downregulation of LOC5570687 in DENV-exposed mosquitoes was temporally associated with enhanced viral replication, indicating its potential role as a molecular switch between antiviral defense and viral exploitation.

However, the mechanisms by which viral oncoproteins manipulate the error-prone MMEJ pathway remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein upregulates MMEJ to facilitate viral genome integration. This heightened MMEJ activity is driven by a marked increase in the protein levels of DNA Polymerase Theta (POLQ), a central enzyme of the MMEJ pathway. Mechanistically, we show that the elevation of POLQ levels in response to HPV16 E6 expression is dependent on the host E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3A/E6AP but is independent of p53 degradation. E6 activates UBE3A to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of RAD23A, a shuttle protein required for delivering polyubiquitinated POLQ to the proteasome. Consequently, the loss of functional RAD23A phenocopies the effect of HPV16 E6, leading to POLQ stabilization and increased MMEJ activity. By elucidating the E6-UBE3A-RAD23A-POLQ axis, our findings reveal a novel mechanism through which HPV manipulates the host DNA repair machinery to promote its integration and oncogenic potential.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}

Although MSMEG_6194 shares structural similarity with class A beta-lactamases, it showed no detectable beta-lactamase activity under the tested conditions. Heterologous expression of MSMEG_6194 in Escherichia coli and {Delta}msmeg_6194 deleted strains of M. smegmatis did not confer significant resistance to beta-lactams, and the purified protein failed to hydrolyse nitrocefin either. However, ectopic expression of MSMEG_6194 partly restores the morphological defects in seven PBP-deleted E. coli strains, and the purified enzyme successfully cleaves the terminal D-alanine from a pentapeptide substrate, confirming its DD-carboxypeptidase activity. Structural analysis revealed the absence of a conserved glutamic acid residue in the omega-loop, which is critical for beta-lactamase catalysis in class A beta-lactamase. Substituting this residue (V139E mutant) imparts beta-lactamase activity, though it significantly reduces DD-carboxypeptidase function.

This study examined the influence of gut-derived bacterial supplementation on the honey bee gut microbiome, proteome, and metabolome across three conditions: (i) controlled cages, (ii) semi-controlled cages allowing contact with nestmates, and (iii) field conditions. Treatment groups received a bacterial supplement containing Lactobacillus helsingborgensis, Lactobacillus apis, Bifidobacterium choladohabitans, and Bifidobacterium polysaccharolyticum, while control groups received only a sucrose solution. Gut samples from 10-day-old bees were analyzed. Supplemented bees showed strong gut colonization by Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, especially under controlled and semi-controlled conditions. In the field, L. helsingborgensis remained significantly enriched in the treatment group, indicating ecological resilience. Proteomic changes in supplemented bees included an increased abundance of major royal jelly protein precursors and mitochondrial proteins, alongside the decreased abundance of ribosomal and translation-related proteins involved in peptide biosynthesis and cellular protein quality control. Metabolomic analysis revealed reproducible shifts across all three conditions. Treatment groups showed higher concentrations of microbial fermentation products (acetate, succinate) and neuroactive compounds (ornithine, g-aminobutyrate), while sucrose, N-acetylglucosamine, and uridine that were constantly lower compared to controls. No significant changes were observed in body or gut weight. These findings highlight reproducible, context-dependent effects of bacterial supplementation on honey bee gut physiology and provide mechanistic insights for microbiome-based interventions in pollinator health.", "date": "2025-11-20", "journal": ""}
