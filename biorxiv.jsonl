In this study, we utilized a femtosecond laser-induced impulse to break the coupling between the growth cone and the substrate, enabling us to evaluate the strength of the binding between the growth cone and a laminin on the substrate, and also determine the contribution of adhesion strength to neurite outgrowth and traction force for the outgrowth. We found that the adhesion strength of axonal L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM)-laminin binding increased with the laminin density on the substrate. In addition, fluorescent speckle microscopy revealed that the retrograde flow of F-actin in the growth cone was dependent on the laminin density such that the flow speed reduced with increasing L1CAM-laminin binding. However, neurite outgrowth and the traction force did not increase monotonically with increased L1CAM-laminin binding but rather exhibited biphasic behavior, in which the outgrowth was suppressed by excessive L1CAM-laminin binding. Our quantitative evaluations suggest that the biphasic outgrowth is regulated by the balance between traction force and adhesion strength. These results imply that adhesion modulation is key to the regulation of neurite outgrowth.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

However, empirical evidence for these trade-offs in vertebrates remains scarce, particularly in the context of ecologically relevant life histories. Here, we identify vestigial-like 3 (vgll3), a transcription cofactor previously linked with age at maturity in humans and Atlantic salmon through GWAS studies, as an antagonistically pleiotropic gene in turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri). By disrupting two conserved vgll3 isoforms, we show that reduction of vgll3, in an isoform- or dose-dependent manner, accelerated male growth and reproductive development. This indicates that vgll3 regulates sexual maturity. However, early-life benefits come at a late-life cost, as older mutant males with a disrupted long isoform develop melanoma-like tumors, validated via transplantation into immunodeficient rag2 models, and exhibit increased age-related mortality rate. These findings highlight vgll3 as a key regulator of vertebrate life-history trade-offs, balancing early-life fitness with late-life disease risks.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

In the absence of defined network junctions, the high conformational freedom of the molecules was previously theorized to confer unique mechanical properties to Olympic gels, such as non-linear elasticity and unconventional swelling characteristics. However, the synthesis of an Olympic gel exhibiting these intriguing features is challenging, since unintended crosslinking and polymerization processes are often favored over cyclization. Here, we report the successful assembly of a true Olympic gel from a library of DNA rings comprising more than 16,000 distinct molecules. Each of these rings contains a unique sequence domain that can be enzymatically activated to produce reactive termini that favor intramolecular cyclization. We characterized the genetic, mechanical, and structural characteristics of the material by next-generation sequencing, oscillatory rheology, large-scale computational simulations, atomic force microscopy, and cryogenic electron microscopy. Our results confirm the formation of a stable Olympic gel, which exhibits unique swelling behavior and an elastic response that is exclusively determined by entanglements, yet persists on long time scales. By combining concepts from polymer physics, synthetic biology, and DNA nanotechnology, this new material class provides a flexible experimental platform for future studies into the effects of network topology on macroscopic material properties and its function as a carrier of genetic information in biological and biomimetic systems. This work moreover demonstrates that exotic material properties can emerge in systems with a high compositional complexity that is more reminiscent of biological than synthetic matter.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders. Understanding GABAergic neuron maturation processes is thus currently a major challenge in basic neuroscience. Thyroid hormones (THs) are required for proper maturation of parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons in the mouse neocortex. However, the timeline of this TH action has yet to be elucidated. Here, we used several mouse models expressing dominant negative mutations of the TH nuclear receptor 1 (TR1), to better define the time window during which THs promote the postnatal maturation of parvalbumin neurons. Histological observations revealed that the action of TH during the first three postnatal weeks was necessary to initiate the expression of parvalbumin and the elaboration of a specialized extracellular matrix called the perineuronal net. By contrast, after the third postnatal week, TH action on parvalbumin neuron maturation appeared to be somewhat dispensable. Transcriptome analysis of neocortical GABAergic neurons two weeks after birth identified a small set of putative target genes for TR1. These genes are at the origin of the postnatal remodeling of the repertoire of ions channels and the elaboration of perineuronal nets. These data suggest that THs act as a timer to define the temporal boundaries of the critical period of heightened cortical plasticity, which plays a fundamental role in the development of neuronal circuits.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

However, to better understand the evolutionary implications of mutation rates, there is a need to uncover the causes of their diversification. In multicellular organisms, all mutations first arise in a single cell in a developmental context. Whether a mutation enters a populations gene pool can therefore depend on developmental events that affect the likelihood of mutant cell lineages of producing gametes. For this reason, the evolution of mutation rates in populations is governed not only by changes in the rates at which mutations occur at the molecular level, but also by changes in developmental features of organisms and how mutations impact cellular fitness during development. We present a theoretical framework that, supported by empirical data from mammals and experiments on the fruit fly, demonstrate how generational mutation rates can be shaped by changes in developmental parameters and intraorganismal selective processes even when molecular mutation rates are presumed constant. Our model highlights how the diversity of mutation rates observed across animals may be the byproduct of organismal development rather than the result of direct selection against mutator alleles. As such, development not only introduces phenotypic biases, it also shapes the rates and trajectories of genetic diversity and is thus at the core of evolutionary theory.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Addressing this gap is essential for identifying patient subgroups most likely to benefit from NAMPT-targeted therapies.\n\nAdvanced castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) lacks effective targeted treatments. Among its heterogeneous subtypes, stem cell-like CRPC (CRPC-SCL) is defined by androgen receptor (AR) independence, YAP/TAZ dependency, and mesenchymal traits. In this study, we identify the YAP/nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) axis as a key mediator of innate sensitivity to FK866 in stem-like mesenchymal CRPC cells.\n\nUsing genetic and pharmacological models, we show that YAP or NNMT silencing rescues mesenchymal CRPC cells from FK866-induced apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and NAD(H) loss. Metabolomic profiling confirmed that NNMT activity depletes nicotinamide, sensitizing cells to FK866. We further validated NNMT upregulation across clinical CRPC- SCL datasets, where it strongly correlates with mesenchymal and therapy-resistant phenotypes, as well as in murine prostate cancer cells with mesenchymal/stemness phenotypes.\n\nIn conclusion, we identify the YAP/NNMT axis as a determinant of innate sensitivity to NAMPT inhibition in prostate cancer.

In Pseudomonas fluorescens, a range of single mutations that upregulate cellulose production give rise to \"wrinkly spreader\" (WS) types--canonical niche specialists that out-compete ancestral types at the ALI. Yet we discover that this is a half-truth: WS mutants frequently fail to establish when introduced alone at low density, but co-culture with ancestral types rescues colonization. Microscopy and model simulations show that ancestors physically scaffold the ALI, enabling stable attachment and facilitating the in situ emergence of an array of genetically diverse WS mutants. Ancestors later disperse, vacate the niche allowing WS mutant expansion.

However, those with more severe cognitive impairment and higher GDF15 levels showed reduced working memory-related activity, which in turn mediated poorer task performance. Conversely, individuals with relatively preserved cognitive function exhibited hyperactivation in working memory regions and working memory performance compared to controls, suggesting compensatory engagement of cortical systems in high-functioning MitoD individuals. These effects were weaker in the sensory domain and absent during affective (cold pain) processing, suggesting an energy hierarchy in the brain that prioritizes essential functions such as affective responses while downregulating more energy-demanding, complex cognitive processes when resources are limited.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

C.; Rose, M.", "abstract": "The state of neural dynamics prior to the presentation of an external stimulus significantly influences its subsequent processing. This neural preparatory mechanism might be of particular importance for crossmodal memory formation. The integration of stimuli across different sensory modalities is a fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of episodic memories. However, the causal role of pre-stimulus neural activity in this process remains largely unclear. In this preregistered study, we investigate the direct relationship between transient brain states induced by sensory entrainment and crossmodal memory encoding. Participants (n = 105) received rhythmic visual stimuli at theta (5 Hz) or alpha (9 Hz) frequencies to evoke specific brain states. EEG recordings confirmed successful entrainment, with sustained increases in neural activity within the stimulated frequency bands persisting until stimulus onset. Notably, induced alpha oscillatory activity enhanced recognition memory performance reflected by increased sensitivity, and suggesting that alpha oscillations prepare the brain for optimal multisensory integration. These findings highlight the functional significance of distinct oscillatory brain states in facilitating memory encoding by increasing cortical excitability before stimulus presentation. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of pre-stimulus brain states in shaping the efficiency of memory formation across sensory modalities and shed light on how dynamic neural preparations support learning.\n\nImpact StatementBy using sensory entrainment of pre-stimulus oscillations we could show thatalpha-band stimulation in particular enhanced crossmodal memory. These findings reveal a frequency-specific functional dissociation and highlight the potential of targeting preparatory brain rhythms to improve crossmodal memory formation.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

They are able to infect a wide range of host plants belonging to the Poaceae family. The ban of neonicotinoids in Europe has resulted in an increasing disease incidence and triggered the need to better understand their emergence and spread. The ability of a Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) population to adapt to different hosts has never been studied. We performed an experimental evolution of two BYDV species (BYDV-PAS and BYDV-PAV) to study their adaptation to four Poaceae species (wheat, oat, two-row barley, and six-row barley). After four months of evolution (4 passages from plant to plant), the replicative fitness of the final viral populations was estimated, and the complete viral genomes were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing in pools of BYDV populations. Wildly divergent evolutionary trajectories were obtained, with stable or increased fitness, up to extinctions of viral populations within and among plant species. To understand these results, the composition of viral populations was analysed in detail using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling, clustering, and haplotype reconstruction methods. Interestingly, adaptation to oat and barley was mainly explained by a combination of BYDV-PAV haplotypes showing specific mutations. In contrast, adaptation to wheat was mainly explained by a combination of BYDV-PAS haplotypes harbouring specific mutations. Moreover, these local adaptations were associated to an adaptation cost in other hosts for some viral populations. The presence of adaptation costs in controlled but realistic conditions opens the door for evaluating practices such as crop mixtures or rotations on fields, as a means to mitigate the impact of BYDV.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

This premise justifies and propels research programs in laboratories worldwide, but with a substantial social and economic cost, warranted by the potential for basic-science discovery and the resulting bench-to-bedside transfer for health and disease. But a different premise would be more fruitful. This article proposes that EEG components in psychophysiological experiments relate to cognition indirectly through their more direct relationship with oculomotor action.\n\nThe common experimental design that includes a baseline ocular fixation period preceding stimulus presentation provides an excellent template with which to develop the present proposal. Electrophysiological and eye-tracking evidence (3 published and 3 new data sets: 6 experiments, Ntotal = 204, in the context of face and affective picture viewing, reading, listening, rest, and microsleep) demonstrates how and why common conclusions, and reliance on them in clinical practice/treatment efficacy and drug development studies, are at best premature.

S.", "abstract": "Neuroimaging research has identified focal differences in the cerebral cortex of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), particularly in the cortical folds (sulci) within higher-level association cortices. The present study investigated the sulcal patterning and morphology of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in individuals with ASD compared to neurotypical (NT) individuals for the first time. We used neuroimaging data from 50 NT and 50 ASD participants. All participants were under 20 years old and male. The two groups were age-matched. Using established criteria and cortical reconstructions generated from each participants T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans with FreeSurfer, we identified the defining sulcal feature of ACC, the variably present paracingulate sulcus (PCGS): its presence in the left and right hemispheres, and asymmetry in PCGS presence between hemispheres. Finally, multiple quantitative morphological features (length, depth, and cortical thickness mean and standard deviation) were extracted from the PCGS using FreeSurfer tools. Analyses revealed that NT participants were more likely to have asymmetrical PCGS patterns than ASD participants (controlling for age and scanner site). However, none of the quantitative morphological features differed between groups. These findings suggest the presence of a variation in the prenatal neurodevelopment of ACC in young males with ASD; however, further research is necessary to uncover the role of this observed difference in the pathogenesis of ASD. The present study also adds to the growing literature implicating variations in PCGS patterning as a trait marker across multiple disorders.\n\nLay SummaryThis study found that young males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show less hemispheric asymmetry in the presence of a notoriously variable brain structure (paracingulate sulcus (PCGS)) compared to neurotypical individuals. Considering that this feature of the PCGS develops before birth, the reduced asymmetry may indicate focal differences in brain development in ASD. These findings further enhance our understanding of the neurodevelopmental characteristics of ASD and highlight growing findings indicating that the PCGS may be a useful transdiagnostic marker for various psychiatric conditions.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrate computational modeling with multimodal neuroscience to characterize how perceptual ambiguity in emotion judgment shapes decision dynamics. Participants viewed perceptually ambiguous stimuli - morphed images of two categories, such as happy and fearful facial expression - and made binary categorization decisions. Using drift diffusion modeling (DDM), we first demonstrate that drift rate, a key index of evidence accumulation, decreases as perceptual ambiguity increases. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) data reveal that the magnitude of the late positive potential (LPP) tracks the speed of evidence accumulation in both emotional and non-emotional stimulus categories, but only when the ambiguous dimension is relevant to the categorization decision. Similar to LPP magnitude, single-unit recordings from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and amygdala show that neuronal firing rates in both regions also encode drift rate during the emotion categorization task. Moreover, fMRI-based functional connectivity reveals that the strength of connectivity between the amygdala and dmPFC correlates with individual differences in drift rate. To establish the causal role of the dmPFC, we applied anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the dmPFC in patients with schizophrenia and found that stimulation enhanced evidence accumulation speed in emotion categorization under perceptual ambiguity. These findings identify a distributed corticolimbic circuit that dynamically modulates evidence accumulation during social-affective decision-making under perceptual ambiguity.

Previous evidence suggests complex interactions between iron status and malaria susceptibility. However, the mechanisms and clinical implications of this relationship remain poorly understood.\n\nMethodsWe employed a multilayered integrated approach to clarify the association between iron deficiency and malaria infection risk. First, we analyzed clinical data from Malawian pregnant women (n=711) participating in the REVAMP clinical trial--an RCT of intravenous iron versus oral iron--to assess associations between iron status and P. falciparum parasitemia detected by ultra-sensitive qPCR. All eligible women received intermittent preventive anti-malaria treatment. Then, we utilized a genetic mouse model (Tmprss6-knockout) to isolate the effect of iron deficiency on P. berghei infection and progression to clinical disease. Finally, we explored direct effects of iron chelation on cultured P. falciparum parasites through transcriptomic and proteomic analyses.\n\nResultsIn REVAMP, iron deficiency was associated with a 50% reduced probability of P. falciparum qPCR positivity at baseline (95% CI [30%-64%], p<0.0001). Iron intervention given at baseline did not significantly modify the probability of subsequent parasitemia across the pregnancy. In the murine model, iron-deficient Tmprss6-knockout mice exhibited significantly improved survival compared to controls (median survival 15.5 vs. 7.0 days) and protection from cerebral malaria (survival 83% vs 17%). Iron chelation in P. falciparum cultures induced substantial transcriptomic (1,397 differentially expressed genes) and proteomic changes (121 differentially expressed proteins; 46 matched differentially expressed gene/protein pairs), primarily affecting processes involved in host cell invasion, protein export, and nutrient acquisition.\n\nConclusionOur findings consistently demonstrate that iron deficiency protects against Plasmodium infection across clinical, pre-clinical, and in vitro models. Importantly, in the presence of adequate malaria prevention intravenous iron supplementation did not significantly increase subsequent parasitemia prevalence.

Scutellarin is a flavonoid isolated from Erigeron breviscapus (Vant.) Hand.-Mazz. and possesses various pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. Yet it is unclear whether scutellarin can inhibit ferroptosis and mitigate related diseases. In this study, we found that scutellarin was able to inhibit ferroptosis in both human HK-2 cells and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with RSL3 or erastin. Mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species generation were counteracted by scutellarin treatment, suggesting involvement of its antioxidative activity. Furthermore, scutellarin increased the nuclear levels of Nrf2 and the expression of its target genes including HO-1 and GPX4. Scutellarin-mediated inhibition of ferroptosis and an increase of these proteins was abrogated by the co-treatment with brusatol, an Nrf2 inhibitor, indicating an essential role for Nrf2 in this process. In a mouse model of folic acid-induced AKI, scutellarin mitigated acute renal damage as revealed by histopathological analysis and serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine assays. Folic acid-induced acute renal injury was associated with increased ferroptosis as revealed by elevated levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a surrogate marker of ferroptosis, which were diminished by scutellarin cotreatment. Specifically, the elevated 4-HNE levels in macrophages (MAC-2 positive) and other renal cells were suppressed by scutellarin. Collectively, scutellarin can inhibit ferroptosis both in cultured cells and in a mouse model of AKI by regulating Nrf2 signaling.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Neutralizing NGF with monoclonal antibodies has shown analgesic effects in painful knee OA, but clinical development was stopped due to side effects in the joints. Knowledge about the biological effects of long-term exposure of joint tissues to NGF is limited. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effects of repeated intra-articular (IA) injections of NGF into the knee joints of healthy mice on pain and sensitization, as well as joint innervation and structure.\n\nMETHODSWe conducted five experiments in male C57BL/6 mice. In Experiment 1, NGF (50ng or 500ng) or vehicle was injected IA into the knee of naive wildtype (WT) mice, twice a week for 4 weeks. We assessed knee swelling, knee hyperalgesia and histopathology. In Experiment 2, mice were injected with 500ng NGF or vehicle, twice a week for 4 weeks and microCT of the knee was performed. In Experiment 3, NaV1.8-tdTomato reporter mice were injected with 500ng NGF or vehicle, twice a week for 4 weeks, and joint innervation was assessed. In Experiment 4, WT mice received 500ng NGF or vehicle twice a week for 4 weeks and were used for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of the synovium. In Experiment 5, L3-L5 DRGs of mice that received 3 IA injections of 500ng NGF or vehicle twice a week were used for bulk RNA sequencing.\n\nRESULTSRepeated bi-weekly IA injections of NGF caused knee hyperalgesia in naive mice. NGF caused dose-dependent knee swelling, synovial pathology, increased bone mineral density and trabecular bone thickness in the medial subchondral bone, growth of pre-osteophytes in the medial compartment, but no cartilage degeneration. NGF injection caused sprouting of NaV1.8+ neurons in the medial but not the lateral synovium. ScRNAseq of the synovium revealed upregulated genes related to neuronal sprouting, synovial fibrosis and ossification, confirming histopathological findings. Bulk RNA seq of DRG showed upregulated pathways related to axonal growth.\n\nCONCLUSIONSIn healthy mouse knees, NGF induced mechanical sensitization, synovitis, neoinnervation in the medial synovium, subchondral bone changes and pre-osteophyte growth in the medial compartment, thus capturing many pathological changes observed in OA, except cartilage damage.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Competing theories paint it as either a prelexical feedforward hub or a bidirectional interface between sensory and higher-order linguistic systems. To address the debate, we investigated the temporal and spectral dynamics of information flow involving left vOT during visual word and pseudoword reading using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The pseudowords varied in the degree to which they orthographically resembled real words. By combining two directed connectivity metrics, i.e., phase slope index (PSI) and Granger causality (GC), we converged on a hybrid model of left vOT function that reconciles the competing perspectives. Feedforward connectivity from low-level visual areas to vOT emerged at around 100 ms post stimulus similarly across all conditions, spanning a wide frequency range. Subsequently, feedforward orthographic information flowed from left vOT to higherorder areas, especially left superior temporal cortex (ST), at the low gamma band. This flow strength was modulated by word-likeness, being stronger for real words and word-like pseudowords than complete pseudowords. Conversely, feedback flow from left ST to vOT was observed in the low beta band for pseudowords, and occurred later for word-like than complete pseudowords. This indicates that greater processing demands modulate the direction of information flow, necessitating top-down linguistic constraints to facilitate reading. Our findings clarify the functional role of left vOT and explain when and why its connectivity may show as feedforward or bidirectional depending on time and task.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

While the initial formation of associative context-fear memories is well studied -- dependent on plasticity in hippocampus and amygdala -- the neural mechanisms underlying their subsequent consolidation remain less understood. Recent evidence suggests that the recall of contextual fear memories shifts from hippocampal-amygdalar to amygdalo-cortical networks as they age. This transition is thought to rely on sleep. In particular, neural replay during hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events seems crucial, though open questions regarding the involved neural interactions remain. Here, we propose a biologically informed neural network model of context-fear learning. It expands the scope of previous models through the addition of a sleep phase. Hippocampal representations of context, formed during wakefulness, are replayed in conjunction with cortical and amygdalar activity patterns to establish long-term encodings of learned fear associations. Additionally, valence-coding synapses within the amygdala undergo overnight adjustments consistent with the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis of sleep. The model reproduces experimentally observed phenomena, including context-dependent fear renewal and time-dependent increases in fear generalisation.  Few neural network models have addressed fear memory consolidation and to our knowledge, ours is the first to incorporate a neural mechanism enabling it. Our framework yields testable predictions about how disruptions in synaptic homeostasis may lead to pathological fear sensitization and generalisation, thus potentially bridging computational models of fear learning and mechanisms underlying anxiety symptoms in disorders such as PTSD.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Our group has developed and tested an amphiphilic TLR7/8 agonist (IMDQ) and a RIG-I agonist (SDI) that used alone, or in combination, have demonstrated strong adjuvant activity for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in preclinical models. Here we describe the effect of these adjuvants in the sensitization of preclinical models with the ovalbumin (OVA) asthmatic allergic model via an in-depth humoral and cellular immune profiling. We assess their immune skewing and tolerance inducing capacities in previously sensitized preclinical models with different genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6 vs. BALB/c mice). Moreover, we evaluate their effect in an unrelated antigenic challenge with influenza. Finally, we investigate the role of IgG subclasses and T-cell subpopulations in the protection against OVA challenge conferred by the combination of IMDQ and SDI. We demonstrate that OVA-immunization in combination with IMDQ+SDI prevents allergic sensitization via the induction of a balanced Type 1/Type 2 response. Furthermore, it can revert the allergic phenotype in mice previously sensitized with OVA-Alum, through reducing lung eosinophilia, as well as IL-4 and IL-5 production. However, this was dependent on genetic background. IMDQ+SDI sensitization also led to reduced morbidity of a secondary influenza challenge in OVA-sensitized mice.

This duality suggests possible differences in the nature and type of neutrophils present during the infection, generating different effects. We hypothesized that Mtb infection induces changes in neutrophil phenotype and function, influencing the infection outcomes. In order to decipher the link between neutrophils and disease progression, we used a cynomolgus macaque model of human TB. Based on clinical, bacteriological, and positron emission tomography with X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) scan parameters, animals were stratified into two categories: animals that rapidly progressed to an active form of TB, designated as \"fast progressors\", and \"slow progressors\", which include low symptomatic or asymptomatic animals. In this study, we identified transcriptomic signatures of type I interferons and neutrophil degranulation in macaques with fast progression to active TB, which were not observed in animals with slow TB progression. Unsuppervised mass cytometry analysis showed the emergence of blood immature neutrophils (CD101+ CD10-) in fast progressing animals. In addition, circulating neutrophils from infected animals displayed capacities to modulate TNF- production and cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells in a contact-dependent mechanism. In the lungs, neutrophils infiltration in granuloma was higher in fast progressors and specifically located in the lymphocyte-rich region in lesions. These data suggest that specific neutrophil subpopulations are associated with disease progression.

First, we demonstrated the ability of MIRS-ML to age male and female mosquitoes reared under laboratory conditions. Second, we optimised the model with adults emerged from wild collected eggs reared under natural conditions in a semi-field facility, to expose them to more realistic ambient conditions. For each sex we developed three ML models based on the resolution of the predicted adult age class: low (9 day interval), medium (6 days) and high resolution (3 days) from 1 to 15 or 33 days for males and females, respectively. The prediction accuracy decreased as the resolution increased. In males, the accuracy dropped from 99% (low) to 93% (medium) and 85.8% (low); in females the high and medium resolution models showed 89.4% and 78.5% accuracy, which decreased to 72.6% for the low resolution.

In addition, these data are often characterized by sparsity with extra zeros. Emerging evidence suggests that imbalances in microbial composition, potentially regulated by host gene expression, have been associated with various diseases. Investigating the associations between the microbiome and host transcriptome can help uncover the mechanisms underlying human health and disease. Current existing approaches for evaluating their associations largely rely on Pearson or Spearman correlations, ignoring the fact that microbiome data are sparse count data, leading to potentially biased results. To overcome this issue, we present MITScan, a genome-wide MIcrobiome-host Transcriptome Score-based association analysis, employing zero-inflated negative binomial models to accommodate extra zeros commonly observed in microbiome data. To address the large number of paired association tests arising from two high-dimensional omics datasets, we utilize score tests and matrix calculations for computational efficiency. We further apply an empirical permutation method with genomic control to effectively control the family-wise error rate in studies with small sample sizes. With real datasets, we demonstrate that MITScan achieves computational gains of three orders of magnitude compared to commonly used Wald or t tests, while identifying similar significant OTU-gene pairs.

This methodology presents multiple drawbacks, particularly for variation studies, often yielding unrepresentative and incomplete observations regarding the diversity of the species or group under study. Pangenomes are collections of genomic sequences from several individuals of a species or population, which allow to overcome the limitations of studies based on a single reference genome. In this study, we produced a 93-assembly pangenome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the reference-free method PanGenome Graph Builder (PGGB). The aim was to investigate the diversity within this species using this novel methodology, encompassing genomic sequences, genes, and pseudogenes. The pangenome exhibited a total length of 488.78 Mb, consisting of 30,391,243 nodes and 7,189,634 edges. We mapped a total of 2,325,577 genes and 23,894 pseudogenes across 93 assemblies, of which 36% and 0.9%, respectively, were classified as core. The observed variation in terms of genes and especially pseudogenes related to the geographical distance between sampling sites. Since the simulated pangenome growth curve based on gene did not reach a plateau, new accessions could potentially expand the represented diversity. This study enriches our understanding of intra-specific variation in A. thaliana and provides a new viewpoint on the potential applications of pangenomes in diversity research.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

In atopic dermatitis, MintFlow prioritized an epidermal resident T cell program and a dendritic cell activation niche within inflammatory hotspots within the superficial dermis. In melanoma, MintFlow identified fibrotic stroma resembling keloid scar tissue. In kidney cancer, MintFlow resolved immunosuppressive CD8+ T cell states within tertiary lymphoid structures. Furthermore, MintFlow enabled in silico perturbations of disease-relevant cell states and tissue environments. Regulatory T cell modulation in atopic dermatitis suppressed the pro-inflammatory tissue environment, supporting manipulation of these cells as a therapeutic target. Spatially-targeted macrophage depletion in kidney cancer reverted immunosuppressed T cell states, and the corresponding gene programs correlated with survival in large kidney cancer patient cohorts. These findings position MintFlow as a tool for unbiased prediction of disease mechanisms and in silico perturbations to accelerate translational hypothesis generation and guide therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

In ctenophores - early-branching marine animals - a syncytial nerve net underlies complex behaviors such as geotaxis, feeding, and escape. At the center of this system is the aboral organ (AO), a dense sensory hub that detects motion, light, and pressure and coordinates ciliary movement. However, the AO's cellular architecture and its integration with the nerve net remain poorly understood. Here, using volume electron microscopy in Mnemiopsis leidyi, we reveal that the syncytial nerve net converges and condenses around the AO, forming synaptic connections with diverse effector cells. We annotated 17 distinct cell types, including candidate light and pressure sensors, novel ciliated and secretory cells, and non-synaptic vesicle-rich cells likely involved in volume transmission. Our data shows that signal processing within the AO relies on both synaptic and non-synaptic communication.

Mouse models of infection suggest that chlamydia-induced dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) can drive harmful cytokine responses, pathogenic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrosis. To investigate these mechanisms in humans, we profiled miRNA and mRNA expression in endometrial biopsies from women with endometrial infection (Endo+) and compared them to profiles from women with cervix-only infection (Endo-) or no infection. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that Endo+ tissues had upregulated genes associated with innate and adaptive immune response pathways, as well as EMT regulation, while downregulated genes were linked to cell cycle control. An integrative miRNA-mRNA analysis, which combined a review of published miRNA regulation in human infections and immune responses with IPA's miRNA target filter, identified differentially expressed miRNAs that modulate these pathways in the endometrium of Endo+ women. Functional annotation of these miRNAs showed a predominance of downregulated miRNAs that typically suppress EMT and regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation, along with miRNAs that usually enhance Th17 responses. Comparisons with previously identified mRNA pathways in blood samples from women with endometrial Chlamydia infection indicated that alterations in TGF-{beta} signaling and EMT were specific to the endometrium. Overall, the miRNA-mRNA interactions inferred from Endo+ tissue suggest increased activity in TGF-{beta} ; pathways that promote enhanced EMT and Treg differentiation, while reducing Th17 activation. These changes highlight a dual potential for promoting tissue scarring while dampening inflammatory responses that could otherwise limit infection.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

To address this, we introduce Graph neural network for Interpretable Microbiome (GIM), a graph neural network framework that integrates minimally processed taxonomic metadata as sparse node embeddings within an unweighted complete graph, enabling direct modeling of high-order microbial interactions through message passing. GIM achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on microbiome-disease prediction tasks (e.g., healthy vs. allergic states) while generating fine-grained, experimentally validated attributions at the level of taxonomic ranks, driver microbes, and putative microbe-to-microbe interactions. By bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and biological interpretability, GIM overcomes a key limitation in current approaches, offering a unified framework to both predict dysbiosis-associated disease states and identify actionable microbial targets for therapeutic intervention.

They block transcriptional regulation of the causative oncogenic fusion protein, EWSR1::FLI1, and cause cell death. However, SP-2509 and SP-2577 are the only LSD1 inhibitors active in Ewing sarcoma; other LSD1 inhibitors have little effect. Studies from our group and others suggest SP-2509 activity may result from off-target activity affecting the mitochondria. Here we identified potential off-target mechanisms of N-(1-phenylethylidene)-benzohydrazides using an unbiased approach, cellular thermal shift assay coupled to mass spectrometry (CETSA-MS). Interestingly, this revealed significant destabilization of the electron transport chain complex III protein ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (UQCRFS1). We find that UQCRFS1 destabilization is likely linked to impaired iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cofactor binding, and that SP-2509 broadly destabilizes cellular Fe-S proteins. Using both chemical and genetic tools, we show that SP-2509 mediated cell death is LSD1 independent and instead requires a N-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazide. Our studies suggest this core moiety alters iron metabolism in the cell. Importantly, we also find that the reversal of EWSR1::FLI1 transcriptional regulation by SP-2509 is independent from LSD1 inhibition. This unique activity is instead associated with the N-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-hydrazide core and destabilization of Fe-S proteins.

To study the impact of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation in mice in high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and the role of SIRT1, a sirtuin family member, in mediating the NMN response, we administered NMN to mice in drinking water to boost NAD+ in control and in inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse models and performed a combination of metabolic phenotyping, lipid profiling and plasma proteomics in these mice. We discovered that supplementation with NMN mitigated diet induced weight gain by enhancing energy expenditure, corrected dyslipidemia, and reversed perturbations in fasting blood glucose, all in a SIRT1-dependent manner. On the other hand, NMN-induced reductions in fat mass, fluid mass, eWAT and mesenteric WAT were SIRT1 independent. Proteomic approaches in plasma samples using O-Link and mass-spectrometry provided novel insights into key obesity- and NMN-dependent changes in circulating molecules with potential relevance to inflammation, liver function, and dyslipidemia. We discovered SIRT1 dependent and independent alterations in key circulating plasma proteins and identified key metabolic and molecular pathways that were significantly affected by HFD, several of which were reverted by oral NMN administration. Glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism and immune-related pathways are among the most significantly affected changes. Causal analysis of proteomic data suggests that observed effects could be mediated by transcription regulators FBXW7, ADIPOR2 and PRDM16.

Particularly the complex hierarchical organization, present in living tissues, has to be mimicked as close as possible for the created models to fulfil the desired function. However, the fabrication of gradual structures incorporating several materials ensuring high cell survival and subsequent unaffected tissue maturation is highly challenging. To get a step closer to the goal of generating tissue models containing controlled gradient structures, here we show a novel approach combining extrusion-based 3D bioprinting with static mixing, using self-designed Digital Light Processing (DLP) printed mixing units to fabricate defined gradual structures. Two passive mixing geometries, sinusoidal and obstacle-based, are designed and fabricated and benchmarked against commercially available static mixers. The mixing performance is assessed pixelwise using dyed alginate solutions that are extruded through the mixers using an adapted 3D printer equipped with cavity pumps. The obstacle structure exhibits the highest mixing rate compared to the sinusoidal design and commercially available static mixers. Beyond mixing efficiency, the biological compatibility of the systems is assessed by evaluating the viability of U87 and NIH3T3 cells after extrusion. Two distinct polymer solutions of differing viscosities, composed of allyl-modified gelatin (gelAGE), polyethylene glycol dithiol (PEG-2-SH), and Matrigel, are extruded through the static mixer, revealing significantly higher cell viability in the self-designed printheads compared to commercial mixers. Subsequently, graded structures mimicking the mechanical profile of native brain tissue are fabricated and mechanically characterized using nanoindentation, confirming the successful generation of continuous stiffness gradients. In summary, this study demonstrates that combining extrusion-based 3D printing with customizable mixing units enables the controlled fabrication of tissue-like gradient structures with enhanced mixing rates and cell viability. The design flexibility and rapid fabrication of DLP-printed printheads enable the adaptation to specific tissue requirements, providing a robust platform for future developments in biofabrication and tissue engineering.

Using the open-source Gray Matter Swiss Knife toolbox, we estimate cortical microstructure metrics in 26 healthy subjects and evaluate goodness of fit, anatomical patterns and consistency with previous studies. CDMD data yielded GM parameter estimates consistent with values reported in previous studies. This retrospective cross-model analysis establishes the feasibility of estimating exchange models from only two diffusion times and highlights trade-offs in biological specificity, model complexity, and fitting robustness, critical considerations when choosing a model for future clinical and research applications", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Older adults experience significant decline in episodic memory but maintain relatively intact procedural memory. This asymmetric decline in memory may also cause an asymmetric change in cross-memory interference compared to younger adults. For example, older adults may experience a significant increase in one type of cross-memory interference while leaving the other unchanged. Additionally, decline in episodic memory may cause E[-&gt;]P interference to either increase or decrease depending on how the episodic and procedural memory systems interact. However, no study to our knowledge has compared cross-memory interference between younger and older adults. We investigated cross-memory interference in younger and older adults by measuring E[-&gt;]P (Exp. 1) and P[-&gt;]E (Exp. 2) interference in 40 younger (18-40 years old) and 40 older ([&ge;] 55 years old) adults. Compared to younger adults, the results show that older adults experience significantly stronger E[-&gt;]P interference while P[-&gt;]E interference was statistically indistinguishable between groups. These results confirm that older adults experience an asymmetric increase in cross-memory interference and suggest that the increase in E[-&gt;]P interference is related to the asymmetric decline in episodic memory relative to procedural memory.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Although it is known that gut bacteria can evolve on relatively short time scales, the extent of genetic diversification of bacteria in the gut environment remains underexplored. Here, we characterize the genetic diversification of the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron during 28 days of colonization of germ-free mice using deep shotgun sequencing as well as genome analysis of evolved isolates. We detect thousands of genetic polymorphisms as early as three days post inoculation and observe highly dynamic genetic diversity in the distal gut. We identify multiple haplotypes of a phase-variable polysaccharide utilization locus (BT2260 - BT2268) and propose that phase variation may be an important mechanism for diversification and adaptation in the gut. In addition, we find evidence that hybrid two-component system (HTCS) regulators are mutational hotspots. We identify multiple persistent and parallelly evolved genetic polymorphisms in genes, including the TonB-dependent transporter BT0867 - a homolog of BF3581 from the commensal colonization factor (ccf) in B. fragilis. Lastly, we find that the small intestine accumulated approximately 20 times more polymorphisms compared to the large intestine, highlighting overall the importance of studying spatiotemporal distribution of genetic variants. These results underscore the prevalence of rapid genetic diversification of gut bacteria, which may have important implications for adaptation as well as interactions in the microbiome and with the host.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

To replace the lost myocardium, resident cardiomyocytes (CMs) dedifferentiate and proliferate, invading the injured area. The response of the myocardium is preceded by the activation of the epicardium and endocardium, which form active scaffolds to provide mechanical and paracrine support to guide regeneration. New CMs use protrusions to migrate and invade fibrotic injured tissue, to replace it with functional myocardium. Here, we investigated the expression profile of the stress-responsive ankrd1a gene in different cardiac structures, at key time points during regeneration, aiming to gain insight into its precise roles during zebrafish heart regeneration. In the TgBAC(ankrd1a:EGFP) reporter line, transgene upregulation was restricted to the myocardium, initiated as early as 15 hours post-cryoinjury, and consistently marked CMs bordering the injury or scar area during regeneration. Transcriptome profiling and immunostaining revealed a potential role of ankrd1a in regulating CMs' dedifferentiation, as well as changes in expression of genes associated with antigen presentation and extracellular matrix composition in the ankrd1a mutant. Our results indicate that the ankrd1a is dispensable for ventricle regeneration after cryoinjury and may be considered as a marker and fine-tuner in the healing process of injured cardiac muscle.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

We introduce CellSpliceNet, an interpretable transformer-based multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict splicing outcomes across the neurons of C. elegans. By integrating four complementary data modalities, namely long-range genomic sequence, local regions of interest (ROIs) in the RNA sequence, secondary structure, and gene expression, CellSpliceNet captures the complex interplay of factors that influence splicing decisions within the cellular context. CellSpliceNet employs modality-specific transformer embeddings, incorporating structural representations guided by mutual information and scattering graph embeddings. To this end, a novel and carefully designed multimodal multi-head attention mechanism preserves the integrity of each modality while facilitating selective cross-modal interactions, notably allowing gene expression data to inform sequence and structural predictions. Attention-based pooling within each modality highlights biologically critical elements, such as canonical intron exon splice boundaries and accessible single-stranded RNA loop structures within the exon. Quantitative comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods demonstrated CellSpliceNet's superior predictive accuracy (Spearman 0.88) and high accuracy across diverse neuron subtypes. Furthermore, CellSpliceNet elucidates a hierarchical, neuron-specific splicing code by preferentially weighting upstream enhancer motifs (e.g., GGAAGAAC) and identifying neuron-class-specific splicing-factor signatures, including smu-1, unc-75, and hrp-1. Thus, CellSpliceNet not only advances the frontiers of alternative splicing predictive capabilities but also provides mechanistic insights into the multimodal regulation of alternative splicing.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

K.; Keswani, S.; Grande-Allen, K. J.", "abstract": "Background: Discrete subaortic stenosis is a pediatric cardiovascular disease marked by fibrotic growth within the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), leading to severe complications, including left ventricular hypertrophy, aortic regurgitation, and arrhythmias. Despite surgical intervention, a 20-30% recurrence rate suggests a complex underlying pathophysiology. Elevated flow and resultant hemodynamic shear stress within the LVOT are key factors in DSS development. While effects of shear stress on endothelial cells have been studied, the impact on macrophages and their interactions with endothelial cells remains unclear. Methods: In this study, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were subjected to shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer. Cellular crosstalk was evaluated through conditioned media (CM) transfers. Gene expression, permeability and chemotaxis assays, immunofluorescent staining, and ELISAs assessed cellular responses. Results: MDMs exposed to shear stress exhibited a pro-inflammatory response with upregulated TNF and CXCL8 genes. HAECs exposed to MDM-CM showed increased expression of inflammatory markers (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) and decreased VE-Cadherin and CD31, indicating increased permeability. Permeability assays confirmed that HAECs became more permeable when exposed to MDM-CM. Chemotaxis assays showed time-dependent monocyte migration in both MDM-CM and HAEC-CM. Immunofluorescent staining revealed diminished VE-Cadherin and CD31 in HAECs exposed to MDM-CM. Conclusions: Overall, pathological shear stress induced macrophages to secrete factors that increased endothelial permeability and perpetuated an inflammatory response. This interaction likely exacerbates fibrosis in DSS, promoting recurrence post-surgery. Understanding these mechanisms opens potential therapeutic avenues targeting inflammatory crosstalk between macrophages and endothelial cells, which could mitigate fibrosis and improve patient outcomes.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

However, the relationship between neovascularisation and mechanical failure of plaques remains unclear. A better understanding of this link could improve rupture risk prediction beyond traditional reliance on arterial stenosis. Methods: Human carotid plaques (n=7) from endarterectomy were sectioned into circumferential strips (n=25) and tested under uniaxial tension with digital image correlation (DIC) to determine ultimate tensile (UT) stress, UT strain, and elastic moduli. Immunohistochemistry with CD31 staining quantified neovascularisation. K-means clustering based on UT stress and strain identified mechanical phenotypes. A decision tree classifier was trained using neovascularisation percentage as the predictor. Results: Strips exhibited variable mechanical properties (UT strain: 32.6% {plus minus} 18.5%). Neovascularisation showed a moderate negative correlation with UT strain (r = -0.46, p = 0.028), indicating plaques with greater neovascularisation failed at lower strains. K-means clustering identified two groups: Cluster 1 (lower UT strain) had significantly higher neovascularisation (median 2.21%) and greater initial stiffness than Cluster 2 (median 1.27%, p < 0.01). The decision tree using neovascularisation alone achieved 78.3% classification accuracy, with an area under the curve of 0.78. DIC analysis revealed rupture consistently occurred at regions of elevated local strain, which significantly exceeded average tissue strain. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a link between neovascularisation and mechanical failure in atherosclerotic plaques. Higher neovascularisation was associated with lower UT strain and greater initial stiffness, suggesting it contributes to mechanical instability. These findings support the role of neovascularisation as a marker of plaque vulnerability and encourage its integration into ultrasound-based risk assessment strategies, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

The kinetochores must assemble after DNA replication during every cell cycle onto specialized regions of chromosomes called centromeres, but the order and regulation of their assembly remains unclear due to the complexity of kinetochore composition and the difficulty resolving individual kinetochores in vivo. Here, by adapting a prior single-molecule method for monitoring kinetochore assembly in budding yeast lysates, we identify a sequential order of assembly and uncover previously unknown interdependencies between subcomplexes. We show that inner kinetochore assembly depends partly on outer kinetochore components, and that outer kinetochore branches do not assemble independently of one another. Notably, Mif2 assembly is a rate-limiting step that can be accelerated by binding to the Mtw1 subcomplex, thereby promoting rapid assembly of many inner and outer kinetochore components. The importance of controlling kinetochore assembly kinetics is supported by a Mif2 mutant lacking both autoinhibition and Mtw1 subcomplex binding activity, which leads to defective kinetochore-microtubule attachments when the centromeric histone variant Cse4 is overexpressed. Altogether, our work provides a direct view of kinetochore assembly and reveals highly interdependent regulatory events that control its order and timing.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Paclitaxel induces tumor cell apoptosis during mitosis by disrupting microtubule dynamics required for chromosome segregation. However, despite initial responsiveness, many tumors develop resistance, limiting therapeutic durability. Here, we used high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the most common and lethal subtype of ovarian cancer, as a model to dissect the mechanisms underlying this resistance. We find that paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest triggers degradation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 and upregulation of BCL-XL, followed by inactivating phosphorylation of BCL-XL at Ser62 to promote apoptosis. In resistant cells, this MCL-1 downregulation is insufficient to commit cells to apoptosis but instead results in a transient convergence of apoptotic dependencies by forcing BCL-XL to sequester the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM, BAX, and BAK. During this state, BCL-XL inhibition induces synergistic apoptosis, even in chemoresistant cells. Surprisingly, we also discover that loss of substrate attachment recapitulates this apoptotic convergence both in vitro and in vivo, with HGSOC cells growing in metastasis-promoting malignant ascites displaying heightened apoptotic priming and dependence on BCL-XL relative to solid tumors. In HGSOC xenografts, targeted degradation of BCL-XL using the platelet-sparing proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) DT2216 matches the efficacy of paclitaxel monotherapy while avoiding the chronic thrombocytopenia induced by BCL-XL inhibitors such as navitoclax (ABT-263). Strikingly, combination therapy leveraging the synergy between paclitaxel and DT2216 leads to complete eradication of HGSOC cell line and patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, DT2216 treatment blunts the rapid apoptotic adaptation caused by other BCL-XL inhibitors, indicating that targeted degradation of pro-survival proteins may yield more durable responses than inhibition alone. These findings uncover a mechanistic framework for safely exploiting the apoptotic dependency convergence caused by mitotic arrest and substrate detachment and support the clinical development of BCL-XL-targeting PROTACs to overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a dichotomous effect on lipid homeostasis, with lipid droplet accumulation in the posterior midgut and depletion in anterior segments.

When smoking cannabis, users are exposed to both harmful combustion products as well as cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC and CBD have purported anti-inflammatory effects through activation of cannabinoid receptors; however, the minimal expression of these receptors in lung tissue suggests that respiratory effects of cannabis may be mediated through alternative pathways. One potential mediator of these effects is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Notably, the AhR is activated by both combustion products and cannabinoids. This receptor is also known to dampen lung inflammation induced by tobacco smoke or air pollution. Therefore, we hypothesized that AhR activation would reduce susceptibility to the harmful effects of inhaled cannabis smoke. To investigate this hypothesis, Ahr+/- and Ahr-/- mice were exposed to air or cannabis smoke using a controlled puff regimen over a three-day period. In the first study to characterize the effects of cannabis smoke on lung tissue and the pulmonary secretome, including extracellular vesicles and secreted proteins, we found that acute exposure induced neutrophilia, vascular leakage, and activation of tissue remodeling pathways, all of which were regulated by AhR.

The purpose of this study was to determine PINK1 expression levels and subcellular localization under exercise-mimic laminar shear stress (LSS) condition in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) or in exercising mice, and its implication on endothelial homeostasis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. First, LSS significantly elevated both full-length PINK1 (FL-PINK1) mRNA and protein expressions in ECs. Mitochondrial fractionation assays and confocal microscopic analysis showed reduced FL-PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria with an increase in a cytosolic pool of FL-PINK1 under LSS. Mitophagy flux, determined by a mtKeima probe, decreased with intact mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential under LSS, suggesting that elevated cytosolic PINK1 is not utilized for immediate mitophagy inductions. However, increased cytosolic PINK1 seems to elevate mitophagic sensitivity toward dysfunctional mitochondria in pathological conditions. LSS-preconditioned ECs showed lower angiotensin II (AngII)-induced mtDNA lesions and displayed rapid Parkin recruitment and mitophagy induction in response to mitochondrial uncoupler (CCCP) treatment. Exercise-preconditioned mice, a physiological LSS-enhanced model, showed elevated PINK1 expression in ECs of the thoracic aorta compared to sedentary control. In addition, exercise enhanced AngII-induced mitophagy induction in ECs and reduced AngII-induced mtDNA lesion formation in the mouse aorta.

Fifteen male freestyle swimmers (mean age: 19.3 {+/-} 1.1 years) participated in a crossover design, performing five 100-meter maximal-effort intervals under two conditions: CWT and passive rest (PAS). Each session included standardized warm-up, pre- and post-intervention measurements of blood pressure (BP), blood lactate concentration (LA), and subjective fatigue (FAS), followed by a second interval set. CWT consisted of 10 cycles of hot (40-41{degrees}C, 60 s) and cold (20-21{degrees}C, 30 s) full-body immersion. Performance metrics--swim time, stroke count, stroke length, and stroke velocity--were recorded during both interval sets. The results showed no significant differences between CWT and PAS in swim performance or blood pressure. However, a significant interaction was observed in stroke length during the first interval set, indicating a potential subtle benefit of CWT on swimming mechanics. Importantly, blood lactate concentrations were significantly lower after CWT compared to PAS (p < .001), and subjective fatigue was also reduced. These findings suggest that CWT promotes metabolic recovery, likely through enhanced peripheral circulation and lactate clearance, without negatively affecting cardiovascular parameters. Although CWT did not enhance immediate performance, its ability to reduce physiological and perceptual fatigue indicates its value in managing accumulated fatigue during training cycles. In conclusion, contrast water therapy appears to be a practical and effective recovery strategy for competitive swimmers, especially in supporting lactate clearance and reducing fatigue following high-intensity training.

Like other X-linked disorders, RTT patients have sex-specific differences in clinical presentation due to distinct cellular environments, where females have ~50% of cells expressing either a mutant or wild-type copy of MECP2 (mosaic) and males have 100% of cells expressing a mutant MECP2 (non-mosaic). Typical RTT females have a short window of normal early development until ~6-18 months, followed by regression and progressive decline, whereas neonatal encephalopathy is more likely in RTT males. How these sex-specific differences in cellular context contribute molecularly to RTT pathogenesis, particularly in the presymptomatic stages of RTT females, remains poorly understood. Here, we profiled the hippocampal transcriptomes of female (Mecp2+/-) and male (Mecp2-/y) RTT mice at early timepoints using both bulk and single-nucleus RNA-seq, including sorted MeCP2 positive (MeCP2+) and MeCP2 negative (MeCP2-) neurons in female mice. We identified a core disease signature consisting of 12 genes consistently dysregulated only in MeCP2- cells across RTT models. Moreover, we uncovered non-cell-autonomous effects exclusively in female MeCP2+ excitatory neurons, but not inhibitory neurons, suggesting excitatory circuits are more vulnerable early in the mosaic RTT environment. The single-nuclei data also revealed that a previously underappreciated MeCP2- interneuron subtype had the most transcriptional dysregulation in both male and female RTT hippocampi.

Their morphology appears different under certain conditions. In conclusion, ANI and DDH values clearly support that C. concisus GS2 as a novel Campylobacter species, for which we propose the name Campylobacter oralis.

Among p63-related disorders, Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal Defects-Cleft Lip/Palate (AEC) syndrome is caused by dominant mutations primarily affecting the Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain and the Transactivation Inhibitory Domain (TID) of the TP63 gene, which are unique to the p63 isoform. These mutations promote protein aggregation and transcriptional dysregulation, ultimately leading to debilitating skin erosions, suggesting that isoform-specific strategies could be therapeutically relevant.\n\nTo explore a therapeutic strategy based on isoform switching, we generated a conditional mouse model with deletion of exon 13, resulting in replacement of p63 by the shorter p63{beta} isoform, which is expressed in the skin at lower levels. Although we found that p63 is required for limb and palate development, p63{beta} proved sufficient to support epidermal formation, postnatal skin homeostasis, and wound healing. At the molecular level, the switch from p63 to p63{beta} preserved chromatin binding and global transcriptional programs in keratinocytes.\n\nWe next used genome editing to delete exon 13 in human primary keratinocytes, inducing a switch from p63 to p63{beta}. This isoform switch maintained normal proliferation and global gene expression. Importantly, p63{beta} expression in AEC patient-derived keratinocytes rescued protein aggregation, restored mechanical integrity, and normalized epidermal gene expression. Together, these findings demonstrate that p63{beta} can functionally compensate for p63 in the skin and establish and indicate that isoform switching could offer a new treatment option for AEC syndrome.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

As primary ECM architects, fibroblasts and pericytes rapidly mobilize to the injury site post-AKI, yet the ECM-driven repair mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Here, leveraging tissue engineering, genetic and pharmacological models, and multi-omics, we profiled the proteome landscape of decellularized kidney matrix scaffold post-AKI and highlighted microfibrillar-associated protein 2 (Mfap2) as a key core matrisome component primarily sourced from fibroblasts and pericytes. Mfap2 loss disrupted kidney architecture and metabolism, aggravating AKI. Global proteomics revealed that Mfap2 deficiency suppressed tubular 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2) expression via estrogen receptor 2 (Esr2)-mediated transcriptional repression and increased protein succinylation. Phosphoproteomics and spatial transcriptomics further demonstrated a shift in mechanical signaling, with Mfap2 loss hyperactivating mitogen-activated protein kinases and upregulating large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (Lats1) in tubular cells without altering integrin receptor activities. In turn, Lats1 suppressed Esr2 transcription independent of its canonical Yap/Taz effectors, without affecting ubiquitin-mediated Esr2 degradation. Therapeutically, Esr2 agonists restored kidney function in Mfap2-deficient models. These findings position Mfap2 as a key regulator of ECM dynamics and mechanosignaling, linking tissue stiffness to metabolic reprogramming required for kidney repair.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

While classical models of mitochondrial dynamics center on cycles of fragmentation and elongation, emerging evidence highlights additional membrane remodeling mechanisms, including the formation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) and mitochondrial-derived compartments (MDCs). These mitochondrial-derived structures, however, have been predominantly characterized in cultured cells and unicellular organisms, leaving their relevance in multicellular systems largely unexplored. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized class of mitochondrial-derived structures in Caenorhabditis elegans muscle cells that are induced in response to intermittent fasting. We show that these structures appear specifically during the refeeding phase coinciding with mitochondrial elongation and are absent during fasting. Consistent with MDCs, the structures, approximately 1 m in size, are enriched in outer mitochondrial membrane markers such as TOMM-20aa1-49 and TOMM-70, but notably lack components of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Their formation requires the microtubule-associated MIRO-1/2 proteins, and their size is modulated by the mitochondrial dynamics machinery.

Building on this, we aimed to engineer defects in the basement membrane to investigate whether pericytes could facilitate its repair. In BMEC monocultures, we observed that micropore patterns in nanomembranes created discontinuities in laminin, which destabilized barrier function.

Dispersal, an important ecological factor mediated by landscape connectivity, could potentially counteract the impacts of anthropogenic stressors through the reintroduction of communities unperturbed by local stressors. However, this potential has not yet been studied in the context of nutrient stressed natural communities. Here, we investigate the impacts of nutrient enrichment and connectivity on freshwater bacterioplankton communities. We subjected mesocosms stocked with native bacterioplankton communities to different combinations of nutrient enrichment and connectivity (volumes of water transferred between mesocosms). We show that nutrient enrichment strongly structures the bacterioplankton community, favoring nutrient tolerant taxa and depressing taxonomic diversity. Connectivity, however, interacts with nutrient enrichment to restore functional diversity in communities subjected to the highest levels of nutrient stress. Despite the ameliorating effects of dispersal, nutrient enrichment leaves a consistent signature in communities, driving a shift from more heterotrophic to more phototrophic communities. Taken together, our results demonstrate that while nutrient enrichment significantly impacts freshwater bacterioplankton communities, connectivity can help restore functional diversity to a certain extent.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

However, traditional models of morphological character evolution often assume that all characters evolve according to a time-homogeneous Markov process, which applies uniformly across the entire phylogeny. While models incorporating among-character rate variation alleviate the assumption of the same rate for all characters, they still fail to address lineage-specific rate variation for individual characters. The covarion model, originally developed for molecular data to model the invariability of some sites for parts of the phylogeny, provides a promising framework for addressing this issue in morphological phylogenetics. In this study, we extend the covarion model in RevBayes to morphological character evolution, which we call the covariomorph model, and apply it to a diverse range of morphological datasets. Our covariomorph model utilizes multiple rate categories derived from a discretized probability distribution, which scales rate matrices accordingly. Characters are allowed to evolve within any of these rate categories, with the possibility of switching between rate categories during the evolutionary process. We verified our implementation of the covariomorph model with the help of simulations. Additionally, we examined 164 empirical datasets, finding covarion-like rate variation in approximately half of them. Upon further examination of two focal datasets that exhibited covarion-like rate variation, we found that the covariomorph model provides a more nuanced approach to incorporate rate variation across lineages, significantly affecting the resulting tree topology and branch lengths compared to traditional models. The observed sensitivity of branch lengths to model choice underscores potential implications of this approach for divergence time estimation and evolutionary rate calculations. By accounting for lineage-specific rate shifts, the covariomorph model offers a robust framework to improve the accuracy of morphological phylogenetic inference.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

E.; West, V. C.; Su, A. W.; Parreno, J.", "abstract": "Cell-based transplantation therapies, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), are used to treat focal cartilage defects caused by trauma or degeneration. In ACI, chondrocytes are isolated from non-load-bearing regions of healthy cartilage regions and then sent to a cell manufacturing laboratory, where they are expanded for cell number in monolayer culture. Once a large number of cells are obtained, they are transported to the clinic for reimplantation into the defect site. The storage and transport conditions from cell manufacturing to implantation may be a critical time that could influence cell viability and redifferentiation potential. Although hypothermic storage at sub-physiological temperatures is commonly used to preserve cell viability, long-term storage of cartilage under hypothermic conditions can impair chondrocyte viability and function. However, the impact of short-term, acute hypothermic storage on passaged chondrocytes remains largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that acute hypothermic storage negatively impacts passaged chondrocyte viability and reduces the capacity for redifferentiation. Passaged chondrocytes were stored either in monolayer culture or in suspension at 36, 19 or 8C. In monolayer culture, hypothermic temperatures preserved cell viability with no difference compared to storage at 36C for up to three days. Additionally, hypothermic temperatures promoted cell rounding, reduced proliferative capacity, depolymerized filamentous actin, and led to a slight reduction in the mRNA levels of specific matrix molecules compared to 36C. Intriguingly, the effects of hypothermia were context-dependent. Exposure of passaged cells in suspension to hypothermia promoted the maintenance of cell viability and reduced aggregation compared to 36C. When stored at 8C in suspension, passaged cells exhibited enhanced expression of specific matrix molecule mRNA levels compared to cells at 36C in suspension. Subsequently, when passaged cells in suspension at 8C were seeded in 3D within adherent agarose molds, there was an increase in aggrecan expression 10 days after seeding. The tissues formed by cells stored in suspension at 9C were thicker and stained more intensely for aggrecan. Therefore, in contrast to our hypothesis, we found that hypothermic storage did not have a negative impact; when stored for 1 day in suspension, it had lasting effects on matrix deposition. The storage of passaged chondrocytes under hypothermic conditions may be beneficial for ACI, warranting further investigations of cell hypothermic storage for in vivo repair.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

However, their predictions still fall short of true experimental resolution. A key challenge lies in accurately estimating the quality of predicted models - known as Estimation of Model Accuracy (EMA) - which is essential for selecting the most reliable structures from among numerous decoys. Efficient EMA methods can directly improve prediction accuracy and outcomes. Additionally, leveraging protein complex interface features can further enhance global accuracy estimation. In this work, we introduce ContrastQA, a deep learning-based EMA approach built on a label-guided graph contrastive learning framework. By using DockQ, a well-established interface scoring metric, as the supervisory signal and integrating geometric graph neural networks, our method provides an effective solution for assessing the structural quality of protein complexes. Results: We evaluated ContrastQA and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) protein complex EMA methods on the CASP16 and ABAG-AF3 datasets. Our method achieved the lowest ranking loss based on TMscore and GDT-TS on the CASP16 dataset, as well as the lowest TMscore ranking loss on hard targets. Our method also achieved the lowest ranking loss on the latest ABAG-AF3 dataset compared to SOTA method. Overall, ContrastQA demonstrated solid performance. Ablation studies confirmed that both the graph contrastive learning module and the contrastive loss function play a critical role in the model's effectiveness.

This study introduces CATERPillar (Computational Axonal Threading Engine for Realistic Proliferation), a novel method that simulates the mechanic of axonal growth using overlapping spheres as elementary units. CATERPillar facilitates parallel axon development while preventing collisions, offering user control over key structural parameters such as cellular density, tortuosity, beading and myelination.

The structural realism of the astrocytic components was quantitatively validated using Sholl analysis. Furthermore, the time-dependent diffusion in the extra- and intra-axonal compartments accurately reflected expected characteristics of short-range disorder, as predicted by theoretical models.

Despite its biological and clinical importance, relatively few techniques exist to measure and map mechanical properties of brain tissue non-invasively and in vivo. MR elastography (MRE) is an established method that has been widely used to estimate tissue stiffness in the liver by applying mechanical waves using an external tamper and measuring their resulting deformations. However, applying MRE in the brain is more challenging due to the skull and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which impede mechanical wave propagation, and tissue mechanical anisotropy, which requires a 4th-order tensor description. In this study, we propose using the intrinsic deformation of brain tissue caused by periodic cardiac pulsation to measure the 4th-order stiffness tensor throughout the brain while simultaneously estimating the 2nd-order diffusion tensor in each voxel throughout the cardiac cycle, which we use as a priori information in the reconstruction of the stiffness tensor. While the DTI-derived mean diffusivity (MD) appears uniform throughout brain parenchyma, stiffness maps obtained at about 1 Hz (i.e., at the fundamental cardiac frequency) show contrast within gray matter, and within white matter pathways such as along the corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata, etc. Generally, stiffness differences at internal tissue boundaries are expected to lead to local stress concentration, which may predispose tissues to damage in TBI.

We present a novel framework drawn from statistical physics -- Maximum Caliber -- for characterizing the temporal dynamics of complex ecological systems in spatially extended landscapes and inferring parameters from temporal data. As an extension of Maximum Entropy modeling, Maximum Caliber models the probability of possible trajectories of a stochastic system, rather than focusing on system states. We demonstrate the ability of the Maximum Caliber framework to capture ecological processes ranging from near- to far from- equilibrium, using an array of species interaction motifs including random interactions, apparent competition, intraguild competition, and non-transitive competition, along with dispersal among multiple patches. For spatio-temporal data of species occurrence in a metacommunity, the parameters of a Maximum Caliber model can be estimated through a simple logistic regression to reveal migration rates between patches, magnitudes of interactions between species, and effects of intrinsic local environmental suitabilities. We test the accuracy of the method over a range of system sizes and time periods, and find that these parameters can be estimated without bias. We introduce ``entropy production'' as a system-level measure of disequilibrium, and use ``pseudo-$R^2$'' to characterize the predictability of the system. We show that our model can predict the dynamics of metacommunities much better than steady state models, when the system is far from equilibrium.

However, these frameworks have rarely been explored within the context of fluctuating environmental temperatures across longer (i.e., seasonal) time scales experienced in nature. Furthermore, consequences of growth differences for other aspects of fitness, including reproductive output, remain unclear. Here, we conducted a long-term (17-month) simulated reciprocal transplant experiment to examine local adaptation in two populations of the predatory marine snail Urosalpinx cinerea separated by 8.6 degrees latitude (1000 km). We reared F1 offspring under two seasonally fluctuating temperature regimes (warm and cold, simulating field thermal conditions experienced by low and high latitude populations, respectively), quantifying temporal patterns in growth, maturation, and reproductive output. We identified striking divergence in life-history strategies between populations in the warm regime, with offspring from the low latitude population achieving greater growth in their first year, and high reproductive output coupled with reduced growth in their second year. In contrast, the high latitude population grew slower in their first year, but eventually attained larger sizes in their second year, at the expense of reduced reproductive output. Responses were consistent with this in the cold regime, although growth and reproductive output was reduced in both populations. Our data provides support for adaptive divergence across latitude consistent with the Pace-of-Life hypothesis, with the low latitude population selected for a fast-paced life characterized by rapid development and early reproduction. In contrast, the high latitude population exhibited slower growth and delayed maturation. Our results highlight the potential limitations of short-term comparisons of growth without considering processes over longer time scales that may exhibit seasonal temperature variation and ontogenetic shifts in energy allocation and imply a radical reshaping of physiological performance and life history traits across populations under climate change.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

To enable efficient AI training, we developed the Mass Spectrometry Data Tensor (MSDT), a structured format based on Parquet that enables standardized, high-performance batch access and seamless integration with GPU and TPU platforms for distributed training. We further extended MassNet to support de novo peptide sequencing, which infers peptide sequences directly from MS/MS spectra without reference databases, and is critical for discovering novel proteins, characterizing non-model organisms, and identifying post-translational modifications (PTMs). We introduce XuanjiNovo, a non-autoregressive Transformer model that leverages a curriculum learning strategy to enhance training stability. By dynamically adjusting learning difficulty based on model performance, XuanjiNovo achieves smooth convergence on complex, multi-distributional data without manual hyperparameter tuning. Trained on 100 million PSMs from the MassNet, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarking tasks. Peptide recall exceeds 0.8 on the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Zea mays datasets. On human data acquired using the Orbitrap Astral platform, XuanjiNovo achieves 38.8% to 144.3% improvement over existing models. MassNet represents the first large-scale, standardized foundational dataset in proteomics, marking a critical milestone in the integration of artificial intelligence into proteomics research.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

The Sec61 translocon facilitates ER import of viral glycoproteins (GPs) and may represent a therapeutic target. Here, we report that the Sec61 subunit Sec61{beta}, although dispensable for GP expression, is required for proteolytic cleavage of MARV- but not EBOV-GP and that an intact furin motif is essential for robust cell entry of Marburg- but not Ebolaviruses. Further, MARV- but not EBOV-GP was cleaved by the furin-related enzyme SKI-1, for which a cleavage motif was identified in silico, and cleavage by SKI-1 was impaired in SEC61B-KO cells. In addition, Sec61{beta} was required for normal N-glycosylation of MARV-GP and mutation of a sequon (N563D) abrogated cleavage. Finally, the absence of Sec61{beta} modestly, and blockade of Sec61 via apratoxin S4 markedly, inhibited EBOV and MARV infection. These results reveal a differential protease dependence of MARV and EBOV and identify Sec61 as a potential therapeutic target.\n\nAuthor summaryThe filoviruses Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) spread from animals to humans and can cause deadly outbreaks. These viruses rely on a surface glycoprotein (GP) for infection, which is processed by the enzyme furin in infected human cells. Cleavage of EBOV-GP was thought to be non-essential for infection. However, using lab models for filovirus entry into cells, we discovered that MARV, unlike EBOV, needs this cleavage step to infect cells efficiently. We also found that the host cell protein Sec61{beta} is necessary for proteolytic processing and glycosylation of MARV-GP but not EBOV-GP. In addition, we showed that another cellular enzyme, SKI-1, can process MARV- but not EBOV-GP. Finally, we found that removing Sec61{beta} or blocking Sec61 activity reduced infection by both viruses. These findings show key differences in how the two viruses interact with host cells and suggest that targeting Sec61 could be a promising new strategy to fight Ebola and Marburg virus infections.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Understanding the specific taxa of gut bacteria changed by stress, and whether stress differentially alters their relative abundance in males and females, has important implications for stress-related disorders. METHODS We modeled individual differences in resilience or susceptibility using the chronic social defeats stress (CSDS) paradigm. Here, C57BL/6 mice are exposed to a novel retired breeder CD-1 aggressor for 10 minutes per day for 10 days. In this paradigm, resilient and susceptible subpopulations can be identified using the social interaction paradigm following CSDS. Fecal samples were collected following Day 1 and Day 10 of CSDS. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing was used to identify the relative abundance of 200 bacteria species. We analyzed group differences in phyla, genera, and species in CD-1 aggressors along with resilient, susceptible, and non-stressed control male and female C57/BL/6 intruders. RESULTS Stress reduced microbiome diversity and caused gut dysbiosis in all groups, including aggressors. CSDS altered the relative abundance of every phylum detected. We report genera whose relative abundance was changed by CSDS or sex. Increases in the relative abundance of an uncultured Ruminococcus species on day 1 predicted aspects of social behavior, with a stronger correlation in stressed females compared to males.

The mycobacterial protein MmpL3 has emerged as a promising drug target due to its essential role in the synthesis of the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We previously identified novel thienopyrimidine amides with good anti-tubercular activity. Methods: We profiled a subset of thienopyrimidine amides determining activity against intracellular bacteria and bactericidal activity against replicating bacteria. We ran assays to determine mode of action by measuring cell wall stress, ATP production, and bacterial cytological profiling. We determined activity against a strain of M. tuberculosis with mutations in MmpL3. We isolated and sequenced resistant mutants. Results: We tested five analogs against a strain of M. tuberculosis with mutations in MmpL3 and determined that they lost potency. Analogs induced PiniBAC, a reporter for cell wall stress, and led to an ATP boost characteristic of cell wall inhibitors. Bacterial cytological profiling of a representative compound revealed a morphological profile consistent with other MmpL3 inhibitors. Conclusions: Together, our data support MmpL3 as the most probable drug target for the TPA analogs and add to the growing list of scaffolds that can inhibit this vulnerable transporter.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

While Firmicutes generate endospores through cell division, sporulation in non-Firmicutes remains less understood. The Gram-negative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus undergoes sporulation through two distinct mechanisms: rapid sporulation triggered by chemical induction and slow sporulation driven by starvation, both occurring independently of cell division. Instead, these processes depend on the complete degradation of the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall by lytic transglycosylases (LTGs), with both LtgA and LtgB supporting rapid sporulation and LtgB alone driving slow sporulation. Remarkably, LtgB programs the pace of PG degradation by LtgA during rapid sporulation, ensuring a controlled process that prevents abrupt PG breakdown and the formation of non-resistant pseudospores. In addition to regulation between LTGs, PG degradation is also influenced by its synthesis; cells exhibiting increased muropeptide production often circumvent sporulation. These findings not only reveal novel mechanisms of bacterial sporulation but also shed light on the regulatory network governing PG dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Error correction, as has been envisaged until now, requires the presence of sophisticated enzymes that utilize energy and/or information to correct errors. Here, we propose a single-free-parameter theoretical model for error correction in self-replicating heteropolymers that requires neither enzymes nor an extraneous energy supply. Instead, the free-energy gradient that drives the self-replication process itself is utilized for error correction. Asymmetric cooperativity, a form of kinetic asymmetry, which has been shown to lead to unidirectional strand construction on the DNA template, is vital for this error correction functionality. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces several experimentally observed phenomena typically associated with error correction in DNA, such as stalling, fraying, speed-accuracy trade-off, next-nucleotide effects, and adaptive tuning of error rates. The model allows us to clarify and answer some confounding issues related to the thermodynamics and kinetics of error correction: What is the energy source for the enhanced base selectivity of passive DNA polymerases? What is the role of thermodynamics and kinetics of phosphodiester bond formation in error correction? We show that the catalysis of the phosphodiester bond formation by polymerases is critical and sufficient for the error correction capability of the polymerases. This observation opens up a pathway to experimentally probe the accurate synthesis of oligomers in the primordial scenario, with the sole energy input being the thermodynamic drive for templated strand construction.

Recent investigations have identified critical distinctions in humans, such as the requirement of subunit rolling and a tenfold slower proofreading step. Although these studies captured key intermediates involved in tRNA selection, they did not elucidate the transitions of aa-tRNA between intermediates. Here, we simulated 1,856 aa-tRNA accommodation events into the human ribosomal A site, revealing the requirement of a distinct ~30{degrees} pivoting of aa-tRNA about the anticodon stem within the accommodation corridor. This pivoting is crucial for navigating the crowded accommodation corridor, which becomes more constrained due to subunit rolling. Subunit rolling-dependent crowding increases the steric contributions of the accommodation corridor during aa-tRNA accommodation, consistent with the 10-fold reduction in the rate of proofreading. The pivoting of the aa-tRNA enables precise alignment within the accommodation corridor, allowing it to traverse the narrower passage. Furthermore, we found that domain III of eEF1A interacts with the accommodating aa-tRNA through conserved basic residues, providing a steric block to prevent dissociation from the A site. Together, these findings provide a structural framework for understanding the distinctions between bacterial and human aa-tRNA selection and demonstrate that the alignment of the aa-tRNA relative to the ribosomal catalytic sites is a critical determinant of translational fidelity.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

However, there is limited research on how histones are regulated and whether insufficient histone supply leads to chromatin instability, thereby affecting the process of tumor generation. Our study demonstrates that ZCCHC4 exhibits dual subcellular localization in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Notably, in the cytoplasm, ZCCHC4 facilitates the translation of replication-dependent (RD) histone mRNAs, potentially through direct interaction with components of the translation initiation machinery. Depletion of ZCCHC4 results in a global reduction in protein translation, particularly affecting the translation of replication-dependent histones. This translational impairment prolongs the S phase of the cell cycle, leading to insufficient histone supply, chromatin relaxation, and genomic instability. Moreover, ZCCHC4 knockout markedly inhibits cell proliferation, colony-forming ability, and the growth of xenograft tumors. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ZCCHC4 plays a pivotal role in regulating global protein translation by interacting with the eIF3 complex, which is essential for efficient mRNA translation in cancer cells and for sustaining the supply of replication-dependent histones during the S phase.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Targeted protein degraders for FLT3 have evolved as drugs against leukemia. Methods: We synthesized and characterized MA191 as novel von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-based proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) for FLT3. We analyzed protein expression, protein degradation mechanisms, and posttranslational modifications by immunoblot. Selective proteasome modulation, an inactive stereoisomer of MA191, and siRNA confirmed the event-driven degradation of FLT3-ITD. Hematopoietic cell survival and differentiation were determined by flow cytometry using apoptosis and cell surface markers. As models, we used cultured and primary human AML cells, FLT3 inhibitor-resistant AML cells, mature blood cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. We scrutinized the databases DepMap, GEPIA2, Hemap, and HPA to assess FLT3 expression and patient survival. Experiments with Danio rerio larvae verified in vivo anti-leukemic activity of MA191. ANOVA and Bonferroni correction were used for statistics. Results: MA191 is a rapid nanomolar apoptosis inducer in AML cells harboring FLT3-ITD (IC50=10.16-11.6 nM; EC50=0.015-0.883 microM). A stereoisomer of MA191 that cannot recruit VHL demonstrates that elimination of FLT3-ITD is superior to its inhibition. MA191 abrogates FLT3 inhibitor resistance from rebound activation of mitogen-activated kinases. Rapid depletion of FLT3-ITD by MA191 (DC50=10 nM) requires VHL, neddylation, and the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BIM. Reduction of FLT3-ITD by MA191 precedes apoptosis. This reveals an apoptosis-independent function of BIM on protein stability. Leukemia cells express more FLT3 than healthy cells (n=3675/n=1249) and FLT3 expression is associated with worse AML patient survival (p=0.0099). MA191 does not harm blood cells and bone marrow progenitor cells and does not disturb myeloid blood cell differentiation. In Danio rerio, MA191 halts AML cell proliferation without significant toxicity. Anti-leukemic effects of MA191 are not susceptible to anti-apoptotic effects of human stromal cells and mutations in the tyrosine kinase of FLT3-ITD that confer resistance to selective FLT3 inhibitors. Conclusions: these insights and the disclosure of the structure of MA191 provide a framework for an improved design of PROTACs that target mutant FLT3 and are not vulnerable to extrinsic and intrinsic resistance mechanisms.

Metabolic profiling allows for identification of new candidates for AD biomarkers, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Despite its translational potential, plasma metabolomic profiling of dogs with CDD has not been previously characterized. Methods: This case control study analyzed plasma samples from ten client owned geriatric dogs, including five with severe CCD and five age matched, clinically healthy controls. Untargeted plasma metabolomics was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses identified significant metabolic differences between the groups. Metabolites were considered significant based on a variable importance in projection (VIP) score > 1.5, fold change (FC) > 2.0, and adjusted p-value < 0.05. Results: Fifteen metabolites across seven chemical classes were significantly altered in CCD dogs compared to controls, including glycerophospholipids, steroid derivatives, indoles, and mitochondrial-related compounds. Notably, elevated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA 20:2/0:0) and reduced ubiquinone-2 levels suggest dysregulation in neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Cholesterol exhibited the highest FC and VIP scores, further reinforcing its role in AD pathogenesis. Hierarchical clustering and pathway enrichment analyses supported distinct metabolic signatures in CCD that mirror those observed in human AD.

Here, we focus on S. aureus's response to the fluoroquinolone (FQ) class of drugs, which inhibit topoisomerases necessary for nucleic acid synthesis and can lead to double-stranded DNA break (DSB) formation. We show that even in stationary phase, when nucleic acid synthesis levels are minimal, loss of DNA repair enzymes reduces S. aureus's FQ persistence. Using genetic and imaging approaches, we found that both persisters and cells that die induce DNA damage responses after FQ treatment terminates, and DNA repair enzymes are needed mainly during this recovery period. We found that starving S. aureus after treatment significantly increases FQ persistence, even in cells lacking the ability to repair DSBs. Our data suggest that starvation increases persistence by delaying the resumption of nucleic acid synthesis after treatment, allowing time for FQs to dissociate from trapped topoisomerases and be expelled from the cell. This study demonstrates that the nutritional environment and molecular events during post-FQ treatment recovery are crucial in determining the survival of S. aureus. Our findings point to processes that can be targeted to enhance the post-antibiotic effect and sensitize S. aureus to FQs to improve treatment outcomes.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

The factors FGF2, FGF4, FGF8, and FGF9 induced Ucp1 expression in undifferentiated preadipocytes, with FGF2 acting most potently and rapidly. This premature Ucp1 induction did not translate into increased Ucp1 protein abundance or thermogenic activity after full adipogenic differentiation.

Anthocyanin pigments enhance desirable pink or dark red colored bracts in dogwoods. Although anthocyanin biosynthesis is one of the best-studied biological processes in nature, genomic and genetic resources to understand the molecular regulation of its synthesis in dogwoods are still lacking. Two classes of genes control anthocyanin production; both structural genes and MYB transcription factors may function as positive or negative regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis. To reveal the molecular mechanisms that govern color production in ornamental dogwoods, mature bracts of three cultivars of C. florida (white bracts: 'Cloud Nine'; red bracts: 'Cherokee Brave' and 'Cherokee Chief') and two cultivars of C. kousa (light green bracts: 'Greensleeves' and mid-tone pink bracts 'Rosy Teacups') were sampled when color was maximally visible. Differential gene expression analysis of the RNAseq data identified 1,156 differentially expressed genes in C. florida and 1,396 in C. kousa. Phylogenetic analysis with functional orthologues in other plants grouped the candidate R2R3-MYB identified in this study into two distinct subgroups. CfMYB2, CfMYB3, and CkMYB2 belonged to subgroup 4, whereas CfMYB1 80 and CkMYB1 clustered in subgroup 5.

This involves adjusting the controller to exploit redundancy in the movement goal, such as when reaching for a narrow or wide target, and adapting to dynamic changes such as velocity-dependent force fields (FFs). Although flexible control and motor adaptation are computationally distinct, the fact that both unfold within the same movement suggests they may share common neural resources for task-specific adjustments. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments combining changes in the target structure and a force field presented separately or in combination. Seventy-six human participants (both sexes) took part in this study, with each experiment involving different participants. They were asked to reach for a target that could change from a narrow square to a wide rectangle between or during trials. Step loads were used to assess whether participants exploited target redundancy. In a separate experiment, we added a force field in addition to target changes and step loads. Our results revealed a reduced ability to exploit target redundancy when sudden target changes occurred concurrently with FF adaptation. Furthermore, the magnitude of adaptation was reduced when step loads were added to the FF. Crucially, this interference emerged specifically when all perturbations impacted motor execution simultaneously. These results indicate that flexible control and motor adaptation interact in a non-trivial manner, suggesting possible overlap between their underlying neural mechanisms, and a clear identification of the timescale at which they are engaged, namely, during movement.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Objectives: To identify predisposing events driving fistula formation. Design: Rectal biopsies from CD patients with or without PFD (CD+PFD and CD, respectively; n=31) were collected and subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Functional analyses were conducted using peripheral CD3+ T cells, intestinal tissue explants, primary fibroblasts and 2D-epithelial monolayer cell cultures. Results: The rectal mucosa of CD+PFD patients is imprinted with cellular and transcriptomic alterations specific to PFD and independent of luminal inflammation, potentially driven by TL1A activation in CD4+ T cells. We identified lymphotoxin beta (LTB or its functional heterotrimer LT1{beta}2) as a novel mediator downstream of TL1A that, along with IL-22, induces a PFD-associated signature in rectal fibroblast and epithelial cells, respectively. This signature includes an increased abundance of fibroblasts, an induction of matrix-degrading enzymes, transcriptomic rewiring of the lamina propria S1 fibroblasts, and an anti-bacterial and immune responses in epithelial cells. Notably, the induction of LT1{beta}2 and IL-22 occurs independently of TNF signaling, revealing a new TL1A-LT1{beta}2/IL-22 axis that remains active under anti-TNF therapy. Conclusion: Our findings revealed unique cellular alterations in the rectum of CD patients with PFD, highlighting the previously unrecognized involvement of TL1A in mediating this signature and supporting the need for exploring the role of TL1A inhibition as a therapeutic approach for PFD.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

However, no therapies currently exist to mitigate the mitochondrial dysfunction linked to genetic deficiencies in MFN2.

J.; Caetano, D. S.", "abstract": "Phenology, the study of recurring biological events, has gained increased attention with the rise of digitized biocollections.

We present a unified statistical theory of phenological distributions that mathematically integrates phenological extremes, onset timing, phenophase duration, cessation, and peak activity and links these phenomena to variation in biocollection data. A key insight from this theory is that phenological sensitivity estimates from biocollection data are confounded by phenophase duration. Both onset and duration contribute to variation in collection dates, and standard regression methods cannot disentangle these effects.To address this, we develop a Bayesian inference framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs) that explicitly models onset and duration as latent variables. We assess its performance under various scenarios, including model misspecification and identifiability, and show that it outperforms three alternative methods. Applying the method to an empirical dataset of over 5,000 herbarium records, we find that phenophase duration frequently acts as a confounder, correlating with one or more covariates across all species examined.

Gene flow - via within-population dispersal and external immigration - shapes population health and evolutionary potential by boosting genetic diversity, but it can also counteract local adaptation. We investigate these processes in a population of great tits (Parus major) in Wytham Woods, United Kingdom. This system represents a large, continuous population of a vagile, widely distributed species. Using a comprehensive social pedigree alongside genomic data from 949 individuals genotyped at 600,000 SNPs, we observe some spatial genetic structure largely driven by the spatial and temporal clustering of close kin. We quantify how temporally persistent this pattern is and find similar levels of decay of relatedness with distance across years, without a consistent genetic basis, which is frequently renewed due to high population turnover. Immigrants make up a substantial portion of the breeding population, yet are often assumed to be genetically distinct, unrelated, and outbred - assumptions that can bias population inferences. We show that immigrants are indeed outbred, as are local birds; have fewer close relatives within the population, and are less likely to be related to their neighbours than locally born birds. Despite low FST and no clear genome-wide population structure, immigrants and locals can be distinguished above chance using a Random Forest classifier trained on SNP data. Our study highlights the complex interplay between dispersal, population turnover and spatial population structure, and suggests that great tits in Wytham Woods experience substantial gene flow within the population and from immigrants, maintaining high genetic diversity and reducing the possibility of local adaptation at this spatial scale.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we systematically compare Elastic Net, Random Forest, and XGBoost across five multi-omics integration strategies: Concatenation, Averaged Stacking, Weighted Non-negative Least Squares (NNLS), Lasso Stacking, and Partial Least Squares (PLS) and individual omics models. We evaluate performance across 588 binary and 735 continuous models using microbiome-derived metabolomics and taxonomic data. Additionally, we assess the impact of feature reduction on model performance and feature selection stability. Among the approaches tested, Random Forest combined with NNLS yielded the highest overall performance across diverse datasets. Tree-based methods also demonstrated consistent feature selection across data types and dimensionalities. These results demonstrate how integration strategies, algorithm selection, data dimensionality, and response type impact both predictive performance and the stability of selected features in multi-omics microbiome modeling.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aimed to determine the similarities and differences between the unconsciousness states caused by sleep and that caused by anaesthesia, and to investigate gene expression profiles by applying tensor decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction to the two gene expression profiles. One of the two expression profiles was composed of mice treated with sevoflurane, a type of inhaled anaesthesia, whereas the other two expression profiles were composed of sleeping and awake mice. We selected two sets of genes (507 and 1048 genes), which are distinctly expressed between sleep or anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness and the awake or control groups. Both sets of genes include various distinct genes which are common to the state of unconsciousness between sleep and anaesthesia. The former is enriched in GABAergic synapses and layer one of the frontal cortex, whereas the latter is enriched in glutamatergic synapses and layer six of the prefroncal cortes. Additionally, both sets of genes were enriched in the RHO GTPase pathway. Based on these results, we hypothesized that L1 GABAergic neurones in the frontal cortex and L6 glutamatergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex use RHO GTPase to differentiate states of unconsciousness induced with general anaesthesia and sleep.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

The adapter binding domains (ABDs) of p110{beta} and p110{delta} contain an isoform-specific PXXP motif. Mutations of this PXXP to AXXA diminish the oncogenic and signaling activities. This loss of function can be compensated by placing a gain-of-function mutation in the helical domain of the P/A mutants. The P/A mutants still associate with the regulatory p85 subunit, but the affinity of this interaction is decreased. p110 with the ABD of either p110{beta} or p110{delta} shows an increase of oncogenic and signaling activities, whereas p110{beta} or p110{delta} with the ABD of p110 have greatly reduced oncogenic and signaling activities. Introducing the PXXP motif in the ABD of p110 results in a significant gain of function. We conclude that the PXXP motif in the ABD of p110{beta} and p110{delta} is essential for the elevated oncogenic and signaling activities of these isoforms. We propose that the PXXP motif in the ABD of p110{beta} and p110{delta} affects the interaction with the iSH2 domain of p85, shifting the regulatory SH2 domains into less effective inhibitory conformations.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Microbial interactions with multiple species may expand the range of potential hosts, supporting both pathogen reservoirs and zoonotic spillover. Viridans group streptococci interact with host cells by engaging protein-attached glycosylations capped with terminal sialic acids (sialoglycans). One potential origin for host tropism of these streptococci arises because humans exclusively synthesize the N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) form of sialic acid, while non-human mammals synthesize both Neu5Ac and a hydroxylated N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). However, the link between binding preference for these sialic acids and preference for host has not been tested experimentally. Here, we investigate sialoglycan-binding by Neu5Ac/Neu5Gc cross-reactive Siglec-like binding regions (SLBRs) from two strains of streptococci, Streptococcus gordonii strain Challis (SLBRHsa) and Streptococcus sanguinis strain SK36 (SLBRSrpA). Structural and computational analyses of SLBRHsa identified molecular details for the binding of disaccharides capped in Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc. Engineering SLBRHsa and SLBRSrpA for narrow selectivity to synthetic Neu5Gc-terminated glycans shifted the binding preference from authentic human plasma receptors to plasma receptors from rat sources. However, host receptor preference did not fully recapitulate purified Neu5Ac/Neu5Gc-capped sialoglycan preference. These findings suggest that sialic acid identity modulates, but does not uniquely determine, host preference by these streptococci. This work refines our understanding of host specificity and challenges prevailing assumptions about the relative role of sialic acids in host tropism.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

C1 was synthesized via a modular and enantioselective-free route using sequential Suzuki couplings, enabling rapid scaffold diversification. Compared to VG-3927, the stereochemically simplified derivative (C1) exhibits superior microglial phagocytosis and validated target engagement. C1 induces TREM2 activation in HEK293-hTREM2/DAP12 cells, and its direct binding to TREM2 was confirmed using both microscale thermophoresis (MST) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Importantly, C1 also demonstrates a superior pharmacokinetic profile to VG-3927, including enhanced metabolic stability in human and mouse microsomes, favorable PAMPA permeability, and a LogD7.4; compatible with CNS penetration.

High blood insulin levels blunt lipolysis and promote lipogenesis, and thus weight gain. Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a weight loss strategy that also lowers blood glucose and improves insulin resistance. However, some people with obesity, or T2D have less fat loss and more lean mass loss after IF. It is not known why some people lose more fat or muscle during IF. We hypothesized that features of obesity, such as high insulin and insulin action in adipocytes dictate less adipose loss and more muscle loss during IF. In humans, we found that people living with obesity and higher blood insulin lost more lean mass after a 48-hour fast. Chronic elevation of insulin in obese mice lowered adipose loss and promoted muscle loss after 10 weeks of 5:2 IF in obese mice, while concurrently lowering adipose tissue interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) expression. Whole-body and adipocyte-specific deletion of Irf4 in mice phenocopied chronic hyperinsulinemia, resulting in less fat loss and greater muscle loss after 10 weeks of 5:2 IF, which occurred in mouse models of equal and reduced caloric intake during IF.

Findings from our taxonomic assessment of elasmobranchs landed at the two most important marine fish landing stations in Bangladesh bring new information and insights about the nature of the Threatened elasmobranch bycatch. This study presents findings from a taxonomic assessment at Coxs Bazar and Chattogram, two crucial landing stations in Bangladesh where most shark bycatch landings happen. Over two years, 525 fish were sampled; 206 samples were of sharks, 91 of rays, and 64 of rhino rays, representing over 29 species across 12 families. Among them are 4 families of sharks, 5 rays, and 3 rhino rays. The predominant families observed were Carcharhinidae, Glaucostegidae, and Rhinopteridae. The most frequently landed species were Sphyrna lewini, Glaucostegus younholeei, Carcharhinus leucas, Gymnura poecilura, and Mobula mobular. Out of the 525 samples, 65% (n=340) were female, 35% (n=183) were male, and the rest (n=2) were unidentified. Finding one sample of Pristis pristis indicates the severity of the decline. Additionally, for Glaucostegus granulatus, 12 among the 13 studied specimens were adult females. A significant proportion of the sampled specimens, 45%, were juveniles, while only 24% were adults. This is likely because these fishing boats bringing the catch operate in inshore water and nearshore seas, which are potential nursery grounds. The overlapping of fishing grounds and these critical habitats poses a significant challenge in elasmobranch conservation and hinders population recovery. The high number of juveniles and female adults in the catch reminds us of the necessity of integrating threatened bycatch reduction measures into the countrys fisheries management.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Following controlled cortical impact (CCI), most of the NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins and inflammatory markers are elevated during the first week post-injury but decrease by 30 days. Genetic deletion of the Nlrp3 gene, as well as treatment with oral NLRP3-specific inhibitors, preserves microglial homeostatic architecture, reduces ASC aggregation, and enhances neurological recovery and cognitive outcomes after CCI. Repeated intravital imaging of microglia confirms that NLRP3 inhibition prevents microglial activation after TBI.

Expression of ER{beta} is reduced in CD4+ T cells isolated from autoimmune disease patients, suggesting that dysregulated E2 signaling contributes to inflammation. We previously identified a novel role for ER{beta} in promoting the TGF{beta}-dependent differentiation of Foxp3+ Tregs, supporting the idea that ER{beta} has anti-inflammatory functions. In this study, we investigated the functional role of ER{beta} in effector T cells, which drive pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. We found that CD4+ T cells isolated from mice globally deficient in ER{beta} exhibit enhanced proliferation and Th1 polarization ex vivo, together with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. We also found that transfer of ER{beta}-KO T cells to immunodeficient mice results in significantly worse inflammation in a murine model of colitis.

TSRs can be modified by two types of glycosylation: O-fucosylation at conserved serine (S) or threonine (T) residues and C-mannosylation at conserved tryptophan (W) residues. PfTRAP, which is expressed in mosquito-stage sporozoites, has one TSR domain that is O-fucosylated at Thr256 and C-mannosylated at Trp250. We employed site-directed mutagenesis by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate two PfTRAP glyco-null mutant parasites, PfTRAP_T256A and PfTRAP_W250F. The fitness of these mutant parasites across the life cycle was compared to the parental NF54 wild type as well as a PfTRAP knockout line. The glyco-null parasites exhibited major fitness defects comparable to knockout: sporozoites were unable to productively colonize the salivary glands and were highly impaired in gliding motility and the ability to invade cultured human hepatocytes. Protein analysis revealed significantly reduced PfTRAP abundance in the glyco-null mutants despite normal transcript levels. These findings demonstrate that glycosylation of PfTRAP's TSR is critical for its proper expression and function, and underscores the importance of TSR glycosylation in the mosquito stage of the life cycle.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

In each marina, hard substrates, zooplankton, and water samples (for eDNA) were collected in triplicate during summertime for metabarcoding profiling, adding up to a total of 111 samples. Using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene (313 bp) and the V4 region of the small subunit 18S rRNA gene (18S, approximately 400 bp), we detected 645 species from 21 phyla, 40 of which were NIS (7 phyla). Only 5% of the species and 5% of NIS were detected in all marinas. The highest numbers of both exclusive native species and NIS were recorded in the Azores (100 and 7, respectively), and the lowest numbers of exclusive native species were recovered in Aveiro (39) while the lowest numbers of exclusive NIS were detected in the North and Aveiro regions (1 in each). A Principal Coordinate Analysis indicated a distinct separation among communities forming three main groups: 1) Viana do Castelo, Porto, and Aveiro; 2) Lisbon; and 3) Madeira and the Azores.

Conversely, the geometry of structures modulates how these three aspects of organic form manifest in different taxonomic groups and ecological circumstances, raising challenges to causal inferences. Here, I apply the familiar logarithmic helicospiral (logspiral) model for coiled shells, to assess its fit to data on gastropod shells and to study allometry, covariation and constraint in coiling behavior, in light of adaptationist and proximate mechanistic explanations. I derive convenient expressions for the three-way relation between expansion rate, apical angle and downward lead angle of spiral paths on shells. Combining several published datasets, I demonstrate that centerline spirals of gastropod shells are well-approximated by isometrically growing conical logspirals. Allometry manifests in the relative growth of apertures. Derived expressions also impose underappreciated covariation in coiling parameters. Specifically, I show that the inverse relation between spire-height and expansion rate, usually attributed to economical and mechanical demands, can equally be explained by taxon-specific lead angles and variation in growth (shell expansion). I further discuss my results in the context of two recently suggested mechanistic drivers of coiling --- mismatch of shell and soft-body growth, or differential rates and directions of cellular processes at the mantle edge. More generally, geometry dictates particular ``laws of form'' for biological structures that have practical use in data analyses and integration and that need to be fully acknowledged when seeking causal adaptationist or mechanistic explanations.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

We further investigated the influence of sex by creating mixed-sex colonies, which revealed a similar hierarchical structure, with both males and females having equal chances of becoming high- or low-ranked. We previously found reduced dopamine neuron activity in high-ranked males; in contrast, high-ranked females show the opposite pattern.

These PDOs faithfully recapitulate the tumor's pathology, mutational profile, and drug response. To enable rapid classification of PDO identity, we developed a new convolutional neural network (CNN) model, TransferNet-PDO, which accurately distinguished tumor versus normal PDOs in culture using digital histopathology images (AUC[&ge;]0.88). PDOs maintained stable cultures and were cryopreserved between passages 5 and 12. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (PanCK, p63, Cytokeratin 13, Ki67) confirmed squamous phenotype and histologic aggression of the original tumor. For tumors harboring TP53 mutations by whole-exome sequencing (WES), PDOs retained the corresponding p53 functional status as confirmed by IHC (enhanced or loss of expression). Somatic mutational landscape revealed that PDOs preserved driver somatic mutations, copy number variations (CNVs), and clonal architecture including low-prevalence subclones.

However, despite the interest in expanded genetic codes containing L-DOPA, efforts to improve metabolism relating to its production have been limited. Here, we report and engineer a LysR-family transcription factor, PP_2251, that can serve as a biosensor for L-DOPA, thereby allowing the optimization of genetic circuits for vastly improved L-DOPA production via compartmentalized partnered replication (CPR), an emulsion PCR-based directed evolution scheme. Using this biosensor, a promiscuous E. coli flavin-dependent monooxygenase (HpaB) was optimized via CPR for enhanced L-DOPA biosynthesis. Engineered HpaB variants could support efficient translational incorporation of L-DOPA into proteins with 80% incorporation efficiency and yields in excess of 250 mg.L-1. Improvements in L-DOPA production are not only of great interest for protein engineering and genetic code expansion but should impact the production of DOPA-derived natural products including catecholamine neurotransmitters and benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), molecules of intense pharmaceutical interest.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

In the present study, we evaluated a commercially available artificial diet (F1675) for rearing S. tigrinus. We found that this artificial diet is suitable for larval growth of S. tigrinus. However, the pupation rate was markedly low. To address this issue, we established a combined diet rearing protocol in which larvae are fed with artificial diet until the final instar and then exposed to raw plant pieces during the late final instar stage. This method significantly improved pupation success compared to the artificial diet alone (21.68%) and demonstrated higher pupation efficiency relative to labor input than the conventional raw plant-based rearing. Notably, final instar larvae pupated without feeding on the plant material, suggesting that non-nutritive cues--possibly chemical signals from the plants--may trigger pupation. The proposed combined diet protocol offers a practical approach for mass rearing and facilitates physiological studies of S. tigrinus and related weevil pests.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

A striking example is the lack of consensus regarding the extent to which newborns spontaneously mimic gestures, and whether such behavior drives bonding and learning. Despite the theoretical importance of these questions, practical challenges limit researchers' ability to engage newborns in behavioral research. Webcam-based, asynchronous online studies have expanded developmental science's capacity to reach older infants. However, such scalable and replicable methods have yet to be deployed with younger infants. Taking a commonly-used neonatal mimicry paradigm as a test case, we assessed the feasibility of leveraging an open-source online platform (Children Helping Science) for asynchronous research with 0-6-week-olds and their caregivers. Caregivers modeled face movements to their 4-45 days-old infants (N = 29, N = 17 included) while webcams filmed their infants' responses; 13 dyads participated more than once (72 included test videos). There was preliminary, moderate evidence against group-level neonatal mimicry of caregivers' tongue protrusions (Bayes Factor ~ 1/3), and inconclusive evidence for or against mimicry of caregivers' mouth openings (1/3; < BF < 3). Simulations identified a target sample size for more conclusive evidence. Finally, we asked whether caregivers perceived their newborns' behavior as imitative. Caregivers' perceptions of mimicry reflected infants' behaviors but did not align with an often-used metric of mimicry (\"imitators\").

In comparison to viral infections, Mtb antigens are relatively rare and hence, challenging to sample. Specialized antigen presentation pathways enable the presentation of such scarce antigens to CD8+ T cells, which are, thus, uniquely poised to survey intracellular environments. A subset of CD8+ T cells prevalent in the airways, known as mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, can be activated through the presentation of Mtb antigens via the MHC class I-related protein 1 (MR1) molecule. Prior work demonstrates that endosomal calcium signaling is critical for MR1-mediated presentation of Mtb-derived antigens. Here, we show that the calcium-sensing trafficking proteins Synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 and Syt7 specifically promote MAIT cell activation in response to Mtb-infected cells. In bronchial epithelial cells, Syt1 and Syt7 localize to late endo-lysosomes and MR1 vesicles. Loss of Syt1 and Syt7 results in enlarged MR1 vesicles and an increased number of MR1 vesicles in close proximity to Mtb-containing vacuoles during infection. This study identifies a novel pathway in which Syt1 and Syt7 facilitate the translocation of MR1 from Mtb-containing vacuoles, potentially to the cell surface for antigen presentation.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

M.; MacMillan, H. A.", "abstract": "Farmed insects like crickets offer a sustainable protein source to feed the growing global population. A benefit of cricket farming is the potential to use waste diets instead of unsustainable, expensive feeds. Brewers spent grain is a nutritionally valuable organic waste product that has been used to rear crickets in single generation studies. However, the long-term effects of spent grain-based feeds are unclear, which makes incorporation into commercial feed risky for producers. We reared a farmed cricket (Gryllodes sigillatus) for five generations on a high inclusion (75%) spent grain diet. Crickets reared on spent grain were 18.5% smaller at adulthood than control crickets reared on farm feed, resulting in decreased yield (mass of crickets harvested), but were able to reproduce and had high survival rates. Cricket performance remained stable over five generations, indicating that spent grain contains adequate nutrition to support long-term cricket production. We also reared crickets on a gradual inclusion spent grain diet that increased from 15-75% spent grain over five generations. While this weaning approach did not improve cricket performance on high-inclusion spent grain diets, crickets on low inclusion diets (15-30%) displayed nearly a 30% increase in survival and yield compared to those fed the control. Therefore, inclusion of low amounts of spent grain in cricket feed may not only be beneficial from an environmental and feed cost perspective, but also from a production yield perspective. Our findings are the first to show that spent grain is a suitable feed ingredient for long-term rearing of farmed crickets.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Cryptic speciation is widespread among bryophytes, and it appears common in arctic and subarctic mosses where cryptic lineages may occur sympatrically in the environment. However, cryptic lineages are rarely considered in genetic diversity assessments. This situation poses a challenge, as the complex population structure resulting from cryptic speciation, along with factors like the predominance of clonality, can lead to inaccurate estimates of biodiversity. In this sense, we studied two populations of the subarctic moss Racomitrium lanuginosum in the forest-tundra ecotone to test the impact of accounting for differentiated genetic groups on moss genetic diversity estimates, clonal structure and microbial covariation. We performed genotyping-by-sequencing to infer genetic diversity and structure in the forest tundra and the shrub tundra. Genetic groups were identified using haplotype-based coancestry matrices and phylogenetic analyses. The clonal structure was explored by determining multilocus genotypes at the population and a finer scale (225 cm2). The covariation between genetic groups and microbial communities (bacterial and diazotrophic) was explored. The recognition of cryptic lineages in genetic diversity estimations revealed differences between habitats that remained undetected when treating R. lanuginosum as a single species. Clonal growth seemed to predominate and affect the genetic structure at the local scale. Finally, genetic groups did not host specific microbiomes, suggesting that moss microbial associations in the forest-tundra ecotone did strongly respond to a genetic component.

The European flat oyster, Ostrea edulis, is no exception. In this study we performed both k-mer based and reference-based analyses on short-read data with high coverage ([~]70-160X) from five individuals. Up to one-third of heterozygous SNPs showed allelic coverage fractions that deviated from expectation. Despite no evidence of recent whole-genome duplication, we detected significant signals for genomic regions of increased ploidy, and 15% and 25% of k-mer pairs distant by a single nucleotide displayed triploid-like and tetraploid-like profiles respectively. In a diploid species, this indicates the presence of heterozygote and homozygote duplications. These results were confirmed by coverage-based genotype inference, which showed that deviant SNPs are located in polymorphic duplications. While duplications affected genic and non-genic regions similarly, their genomic distribution varied across chromosomes, with a notable enrichment in non-metacentric chromosomes. The latter being prone to somatic aneuploidy, we suggest that aneuploidy could act as an indirect driver, with duplications potentially buffering the expression of recessive deleterious mutations in aneuploid cells. Finally, we consider how such widespread structural variation may complicate population genomic analyses in O. edulis and other marine bivalves.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

Despite current therapeutic approaches aimed at symptom relief, their long-term effectiveness remains limited, urgently necessitating the exploration of novel treatment strategies. This study endeavored to explore the role of cellular senescence in CHF, identify the characteristic genes linked to cellular senescence, and predict potential therapeutic agents. Methods: We acquired CHF-related datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and cell senescence-related genes from the CellAge database to identify differentially expressed cell senescence-related genes. We then conducted Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses to elucidate the functions of these differentially expressed genes, constructed a protein-protein interaction network, and screened hub genes. Using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis, we developed a diagnostic model based on these hub genes. Furthermore, we constructed networks for the hub genes involving miRNAs, lncRNAs, transcription factors, and drugs. Subsequently, we explored the potential mechanism of action of metformin in the treatment of CHF through molecular docking studies. Lastly, we verified the expression of the hub genes in a doxorubicin-induced CHF model in rats. Results: We ultimately identified nine hub genes associated with cellular senescence: STAT1, MMP9, MAP2K1, SOCS1, SDC1, MET, EIF4EBP1, ATF3, and NAMPT. These genes exhibited significant differential expression between CHF and normal tissues. The constructed diagnostic model demonstrated robust diagnostic performance in ROC curve analysis, with an area under the curve exceeding 0.7, thereby providing biomarker support for early CHF diagnosis. Furthermore, we identified a regulatory network comprising 94 lncRNAs, 63 miRNAs, and 11 transcription factors and screened 42 potential therapeutic drugs. Subsequent molecular docking simulations revealed that metformin could effectively bind to the hub genes. Finally, we validated the expression of some hub genes in a rodent CHF model, in which gene expression regulation varied across diverse experimental settings.

Interestingly, DNA methylation at the promoter of estrogen receptor  (Esr1) was significantly increased by HFD, concomitant with a down-regulation of Esr1 expression. HFD feeding in mice increased the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and Dnmt3a, and binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3a to Esr1 promoter in WAT. Mice with adipocyte-specific Dnmt1 deficiency displayed increased Esr1 expression, decreased adipose inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity upon HFD challenge; while mice with adipocyte-specific Dnmt3a deficiency showed a mild metabolic phenotype. Using a modified CRISPR/RNA-guided system to specifically target DNA methylation at the Esr1 promoter in WAT, we found that reducing DNA methylation at Esr1 promoter increased Esr1 expression, decreased adipose inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity in HFD-challenged mice.

Genetic accommodation allows plastic phenotypes to be tuned to new environments and eventually to even be lost via canalization/assimilation. The colourful and toxic Heliconiini butterflies have biochemical plasticity: they either sequester their cyanogenic glucosides (CG) from their larval hostplant or biosynthesize them when compounds for sequestration are not available. Here, we traced the evolution of CG biosynthesis in Heliconiini butterflies, a fundamental component of this biochemical plasticity. We first CRISPR-edited the CYP405s, which encode the first enzyme of this pathway in Heliconius erato, and confirmed that CYP405-knockout caterpillars do not biosynthesize CGs. Then, we identified the CYP405s and CYP332s (the second gene in this pathway) in 63 species of the subfamily Heliconiinae, as well as in other lepidopterans. Most lepidopterans have a CYP332, but CYP405 is mostly found in butterflies and has been duplicated in all Heliconius species. Both genes were independently co-opted into CG biosynthesis in the Heliconiinae butterflies and Zygaena moths, in which they were first functionally characterized. Finally, we performed ancestral reconstruction analyses of biochemical plasticity using data from over 700 Heliconiini butterflies. We demonstrated that although plasticity was ancestral in the whole tribe and allowed these butterflies to increase their hostplant range, it might have been lost in few specialized clades, such as the Sapho clade that just sequester CG from their hostplants. This clade has several CYP405 copies, but they lack structurally important P450 domains, which may explain why biosynthesized CGs are virtually lost in species of the Sapho clade. Our findings represent one of the few examples of plasticity-first evolution in which the genetic mechanisms associated with its accommodation/assimilation are known. This study also emphasizes the importance of co-option in the evolution of complex traits, such as toxicity.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": ""}

An example highlighting this difficulty was a discovery in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) of a regeneration-associated gene that has been identified as either Kazald1 or Kazald2. Since orthology inference of genes across species is crucial to identifying gains and losses of gene functions, and thus if gene usage is likely to be consistent across species, we investigated the evolution of the axolotl genes using an extensive cross-species analysis. Molecular phylogeny inference conclusively identified the regeneration-associated gene as Kazald2, but also revealed an undescribed four-member Kazald gene family in jawed vertebrates. Moreover, synteny comparisons demonstrated that this family originated in the ancestral two-rounds of whole genome duplication. Additionally, we performed vertebrate-wide comparisons of Kazald gene expression profiles, employing available RNA-Seq which we validated in whole tissues of axolotl, zebrafish, and sharks. This uncovered seemingly ancestral connections conserved over jawed vertebrate evolution, such as Kazald1 with skeletogenesis and odontogenesis and Kazald2 with regeneration. It also suggested novel putative roles within specific lineages, including Kazald3 in teleost fish skeletogenesis and Kazald4 within avian brains. Our study thus demonstrates the establishment of a Kazald gene quartet in the jawed vertebrate ancestor, and elucidates the asymmetry of gene fates of its members, including deeply ancestral roles and comparably recent innovations.

Some of its characteristics are slow cognitive decline, memory problems, and behavioral changes. AD patient brains show a progressive synaptic toxicity, autophagy, neuroinflammation, excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), neuronal death and oxidative stress, which occurs due to imbalance in metal homeostasis in addition to the deposition of tau and amyloid-{beta} protein. In AD brains, lipid peroxidation, iron buildup, and elevated oxidative stress, point to a possible molecular connection between ferroptosis and AD neurodegeneration. In this study, we will present the genetic and bioinformatics perspective on the relationship between ferroptosis and AD using Neural network and Machine learning models. Through our study we identified seven ferroptosis related biomarkers that were expressed abnormally in AD. Machine learning ultimately led to the identification of three candidate genes that could be used to develop prediction model. Neural Network (NN) was then used to develop a diagnostic prediction model, validated by ROC curve, which gave good diagnostic values in the analysis. Ferroptosis is substantially correlated with functional metabolism in AD patients in the analysis.
