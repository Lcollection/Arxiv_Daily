Here, we introduce a comprehensive Bayesian framework to address this. Our approach features BFMAP-SSS for individual-level data, which uses a linear mixed model (LMM) and shotgun stochastic search with simulated annealing. For summary statistics, we develop FINEMAP-adj and SuSiE-adj, novel strategies that directly use standard FINEMAP and SuSiE for samples of related individuals by employing LMM-derived inputs (particularly a relatedness-adjusted linkage disequilibrium matrix). Furthermore, gene-level posterior inclusion probability (PIPgene) is proposed to enhance detection power by aggregating variant signals. Extensive simulations based on pig genotypes show our methods substantially outperform existing tools (FINEMAP, SuSiE, FINEMAP-inf, SuSiE-inf, and GCTA-COJO) in samples of related individuals, achieving notable improvements in fine-mapping accuracy (e.g., up to several-fold increases in AUPRC). PIPgene markedly improves candidate gene identification. Application to Duroc pig traits demonstrates practical utility. This work provides robust, validated methods and associated software and scripts for accurate fine-mapping in populations with complex relatedness.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

However, how these circuits operate collectively in complex visual environments remains unclear. To understand how a mixture of visual stimuli--including those caused by the fly's own actions--jointly determines its motor program, we developed an integrative model of Drosophila visuomotor processing. In particular, we derived simple models from flies' wing responses to individual visual patterns and combined them through different internal models. We compared the steering behavior of these \"virtual flies\" with those of flying flies that freely changed their orientation. The results of these experiments supported the idea that, for selective visual patterns, flies employ suppressive mechanisms between competing visuomotor reflexes, consistent with an efference copy-based internal model. Our model provides a formal description of vision-based navigation strategies of Drosophila under complex visual environments.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Negative membrane curvature is both necessary and sufficient for WAVE complex linear membrane association in the presence of upstream activators (Rac, Arf1/6, PIP3) and the PRD domains of both WAVE2 and Abi2, providing a potential mechanistic basis for templating of lamellipodia and their emergent behaviors, including barrier avoidance. Through computational modeling, we demonstrate that WAVE complexs linear organization and preference for negative curvature both play important roles in robust lamellipodia formation.

This abortive infection strategy is beneficial in stopping fast lytic infections, as cells die before spreading the virus to neighboring cells. However, many archaea are infected by chronic \"temperate\" viruses that coexist with their hosts for extended periods. In such situations, abortive infection could be detrimental, as the cost of immunity may outweigh that of infection. In this study, we examine an archaeal Type II-C CBASS system from Haloferax strain Atlit 48N that was heterologously expressed in the model organism Haloferax volcanii DS2. We demonstrate that this system protects against a chronically infecting virus, HFPV-1, and enables clearing of the virus after several passages without killing the host. Moreover, cells that have cleared the virus become substantially more resistant to future HFPV-1 infections, without acquiring CRISPR spacers from that virus. Cell death during viral infection only occurs after extensive incubation with HFPV-1. These findings suggest that CBASS could be beneficial even for archaea exposed to chronic infecting viruses, potentially explaining why such systems are relatively common in archaea.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined the postnatal development of glutamatergic synaptic connectivity and intrinsic excitability in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PYR) and Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVIN) in the ACC of mice harboring a deletion in SHANK3 (Shank3B-/-), a well-established genetic cause of autism. We found that ACC PVINs in Shank3B-/- mice exhibit reduced excitability and in vivo hypoactivity as early as postnatal day 15 (P15) despite receiving normal levels of glutamatergic input. This early PVIN hypoexcitability is associated with decreased feedforward inhibition from the mediodorsal thalamus and reduced hyperpolarization-activated (Ih) currents mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channels. In contrast, PYRs display normal excitability and synaptic input at this stage but already exhibit reduced Ih currents, indicating an early emergence of HCN channel dysfunction in both PYR and PVIN. By adulthood, both neuron populations undergo marked phenotypic changes, characterized by reduced glutamatergic synaptic input and divergent alterations in excitability. Together, these findings reveal a distinct sequence of early PVIN dysfunction followed by cell-type specific circuit reorganization within ACC layer 2/3 of Shank3B-/- mice and identify HCN channelopathy and impaired PVIN-mediated inhibition as early pathogenic features of SHANK3-related neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Moreover, whether cavefish sleep less than surface individuals in their natural habitats is currently unknown. Analyzing the distribution of sleep loss and its relationship with other regressive traits in a phylogenetic framework is critical to inform the selective pressures across the different lineages. We measured sleep and locomotor activity in 15 distinct populations of A. mexicanus, including lineages that are broadly representative of the 34 cavefish populations identified to date. Sleep was drastically reduced in all cave and hybrid populations that were tested. A subset of caves contain hybrid populations of A. mexicanus, which show a broad range of eye and pigmentation phenotypes, yet have evolved near-complete loss of sleep. Mapping behavioral changes onto the phylogeny of A. mexicanus populations revealed that loss of sleep and elevated locomotor activity have evolved at least three times. Analysis of sleep in the wild confirms that the sleep loss phenotype observed in lab-reared fish is also present in the natural environment. Together, these findings reveal deep evolutionary convergence on sleep loss in cavefish and provide evidence for sleep loss as a primary trait contributing to cave adaptation.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

However, its broader utility is constrained by a limited genetic toolbox, particularly lacking robust genetic switches for inducible gene expression. Addressing this gap, we developed a novel genetic switch for L. plantarum based on a strong bacteriophage-derived promoter and the food-grade inducer, cumate. However, the switch was susceptible to leaky expression in the late log phase of bacterial growth, which was correlated to a reduction in the culture pH. This leakiness was partially resolved by regulating culture conditions (temperature and nutrients) to limit growth below a certain bacterial density. More interestingly, leaky expression could be stably suppressed by encapsulating the bacteria in alginate as an engineered living material. This physically restricted growth and limited the pHdrop, thereby enhancing the switch performance. The possibilities to regulate protein secretion over several days, reversibly switch protein production, and establish dual functionalities by co-encapsulating strains with different switches were demonstrated. Thus, for the first time, we show a material based strategy to enhance the performance of a genetic switch in bacteria.

To mitigate these effects, the lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) is applied annually on a rotating basis to selected Great Lakes tributaries to kill larval lamprey before they become juveniles, out-migrate to the lakes, and parasitize other fishes. It has been hypothesized that larval size (e.g., mass, length) may affect survival time in response to TFM. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with 8,611 larvae across four temporal replicates, in which TFM concentrations equivalent to those used in present-day stream treatments were applied for up to 18 hours. When examining the survival times of larval lamprey exposed to TFM, we found a significant, positive relationship between length, mass, toxicity, and their interactions. For every one mm increase in total length, a corresponding increase by one gram of mass reduced survival time by 0.4315 minutes [95% CI: 0.5283 - 0.2992] and vice versa (i.e., the significant interaction between length and mass revealed that as larvae increase in mass, the survival benefit to being longer decreases, and vice versa). The changes in total length and mass of larval sea lamprey stored in ethanol for four months was also quantified. The observation that five larvae survived well past the 12-hour time window of a typical TFM field treatment highlights the need for continuous monitoring and the development of new control strategies to ensure the continued effective management of this invasive species.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Combined magneto- and electroencephalography signals were recorded during a visual oddball paradigm. Observers were instructed to respond to rare targets of a deviant shape and ignore rare non-targets of a deviant color. Source analysis was based on noise-normalized minimum-norm estimates in an individual, MRI-based source space. Critically, the cortical source space was extended to include the cornu ammonis of the hippocampus. Source analysis at the P3 peak showed strong sources in retrosplenial cortex and a weaker source in hippocampus. Activity in left somatosensory cortex was related to the button presses indicating target detection. Subsequent activity was observed in insula and anterior mid-cingulate cortex. Further stimulation studies were used to probe the spread of these sources and the plausibility of their combination to explain the data. In these models, EEG was dominated by retro-splenial cortex, while MEG was dominated by activity in primary somatosensory cortex. Except for somatosensory cortex, EEG showed better signal-to-noise ratio than MEG, but the combination of MEG and EEG increased the signal-to-noise ratio and specificity at the source level.

FGR pregnancies showed significantly elevated maternal serum ferritin and lower red cell distribution width, although remained within normal clinical values. Placental iron uptake transporters TFRC and DMT1 were significantly upregulated, while the iron exporter to the fetus, ferroportin, was reduced, indicating increased iron retention in the FGR placenta.

Using human cerebral organoids and multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), we investigated how mechanical stress disrupts network stability and identified key mechanisms regulating recovery. Blast overpressure exposure destabilized small-world network (SWN) organization, increasing network fragmentation and reducing overall integration. Merged SWNs, which exhibit high connectivity, were particularly vulnerable, while fragmented and single SWNs persisted for extended periods, indicating a shift toward less resilient network states. Optogenetic stimulation promoted network recovery, reducing the persistence of fragile states and facilitating transitions toward more cohesive network structures. GABAergic signaling emerged as a critical regulator of network resilience, with pharmacological inhibition exacerbating fragmentation and impairing network reorganization. These findings reveal fundamental principles of how inhibitory networks regulate circuit stability, with implications extending beyond mechanical injury to broader conditions characterized by network dysfunction, including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the mechanisms governing network adaptation and resilience could inform new therapeutic strategies aimed at stabilizing disrupted neural circuits across a range of neurological conditions.\n\nSignificance statementNeuronal networks must dynamically adapt to maintain function in the face of disruption, yet the mechanisms that govern network resilience remain poorly understood. Using human cerebral organoids, we demonstrate that primary blast overpressure destabilizes small-world networks, increasing fragmentation and reducing overall connectivity. Critically, GABAergic signaling emerges as a key stabilizer, with inhibition of GABA receptors amplifying network fragmentation and impairing recovery. These findings provide fundamental insight into how neural circuits resist and recover from mechanical stress, bridging gaps between basic neuroscience, injury pathology, and potential therapeutic interventions. By identifying inhibitory signaling as a regulator of network resilience, our work informs not only traumatic brain injury treatment strategies but also broader efforts to restore functional connectivity in neurological disorders, from epilepsy to neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

To address this issue, we have developed a novel high-content phenotypic screening platform using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons to investigate the PINK1-PARKIN mitophagy pathway, a critical process in PD pathogenesis.\n\nUtilising high throughput, 384 well arrayed CRISPR-CAS9 genetic manipulation and high-content immunofluorescence imaging complemented with machine learning analysis, we examined ubiquitin (Ub) pSer65 levels. Ub pSer65, a potential PD clinical biomarker, is a key marker of mitophagy initiation in dopaminergic neurons upon mitophagy initiation using exogenous stimuli to mimic the disease relevant environment. The CRISPR-CAS9 knockout (KO) screen revealed two distinct phenotypic classes: essential genes causing cell death upon deletion, and genes modulating Ub pSer65 levels. Notably, KO of PINK1, PARKIN, and TOM7 genes decreased Ub pSer65 upregulation during mitophagy activation, confirming their established roles in the pathway and validating the suitability of the platform for target identification.\n\nThis innovative platform provides a precise tool to further interrogate PD-associated genes, offering insights into mitophagy-related pathogenic mechanisms and identification of potential therapeutic targets. By bridging functional genomics with disease-specific neuronal models, this approach presents a promising strategy for advancing PD research and developing targeted interventions.

Understanding the interactions between cyanobacteria and their cyanospheres is essential for predicting the success of terrestrial cyanobacteria in providing ecosystem services in nutrient-poor environments. However, knowledge of the microbial diversity within the cyanosphere remains limited.\n\nIn this study, we employed metagenomic sequencing to reconstruct 410 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from cyanosphere-associated microbes linked to 56 unialgal terrestrial cyanobacteria cultures, representing 12 distinct cyanobacteria orders. Our findings revealed that the composition of cyanosphere microbial communities was unique to each cyanobacterial host and was significantly shaped by environmental factors such as habitat, precipitation, and temperature from which the cultures were originally obtained. Notably, three microbial genera, Brevundimonas, Devosia, and Sphingopyxis, were present in over 30% of the cyanospheres, forming a core cyanosphere microbiome. Functional gene analysis showed a distinction between the cyanobacteria and their associated cyanospheres, with dissimilatory nitrate reduction being the dominant pathway in the cyanosphere, while nitrogen fixation was more common in the cyanobacteria. Three cyanospheres also contained nitrogen fixation genes of which two hosts were nitrogen fixation capable themselves. The cyanosphere harbored genes for polysaccharide lyases, indicating a possible link to the exopolysaccharides produced by the cyanobacteria. Given the observed variability in microbial community composition and function across different cyanobacterial hosts, future ecological assessments and restoration efforts involving cyanobacteria should not only focus on the cyanobacteria themselves but also consider their associated microbial communities.\n\nImportanceOur study identifies members of a highly understudied, and potentially under-valued, microbial community -- the cyanosphere. We used a diversity of terrestrial cyanobacteria to understand how the cyanosphere composition and predicted functions were influenced by the host cyanobacterium and environmental factors using metagenomics. This is a new approach to study the cyanosphere and provides insights into the diversity of terrestrial microbial communities. Importantly, our results underscore the need to consider microbial consortia when assessing the ecological potential of cyanobacteria in terrestrial restoration.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Yet, we know little about spatial and temporal patterns of SAC in empirical data. Here, we assess SAC in both observed species distributions and species richness, quantifying its magnitude and prevalence over large extents and across spatial resolutions. We also assess its dynamics over the past 50 years. Location: Czechia, Europe, New York State, Japan Time period: 1972 - 2017 Major taxa studied: Birds Methods: We analyzed four temporally replicated gridded bird atlases, each aggregated to multiple grain sizes. To measure SAC in species distributions, we used the Join count statistic (JC) and its deviation from the expectation under a random distribution. We assessed temporal changes in JC and their relationship with changes in occupancy, given their close association. We used Moran's I to measure SAC in species richness. Results: Both species distributions and diversity were positively autocorrelated across all regions, periods, and grains, and the magnitude of autocorrelation mostly decreased with increasing grain. We found that the temporal change of JC varied across species and regions, with zero average trends in Moran's I, JC, and occupancy. However, when JC and occupancy were considered jointly, we found systematic temporal shifts: contracting species became more aggregated (compact) while expanding species became more fragmented (disjoint). Main conclusions: Stronger SAC at finer grains suggests greater predictability of diversity and distributions at these scales. Despite zero average change in occupancy or SAC, their coupled shifts highlight the importance of considering both jointly. We found long-distance dispersal (rather than advancing edge) and vulnerability of isolated populations to extinction as the major drivers of range dynamics in temperate birds.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

We compared macroevolutionary trajectories across dental features quantifying five different traits using metrics of dental topography and size. Studying a sample of 110 species, we reconstructed the mode and tempo of dental evolution. We found multiple bursts of dental diversification through time, each involving different dental traits. Trait diversification was associated with different dietary radiations and could be traced to different nodes. Shifts in adaptive regimes were found in four traits, all of them concentrated within family Phyllostomidae. Evolutionary rate covariation differed across traits. We found low evolutionary covariation between measures of dental size and topography. Evolutionary modelling indicated dental traits evolved under different modes, signalling independent evolutionary trajectories.

S.; Paape, T.; Xie, M.; Seaver, S. M.", "abstract": "Flux balance analysis has proven to be a successful approach in metabolic engineering and systems biology, for predicting intracellular fluxes of large genome-scale networks and the essentiality of genes encoding enzymes and regulatory factors. Flux balance analysis (FBA) relies on a key assumption of a metabolic state being persistent (\"steady\") over a given time frame. This assumption works well for microbial growth because of the ease with which microbial media can be fixed, biomass can be decomposed, and growth rates can be measured. However, the assumption is far less tenable for the cells and tissues of complex multicellular organisms, particularly if any integrated data is sampled from a heterogeneous collection of developing cells continually interacting between and across tissues. These will likely exhibit transient metabolic states equilibrating over varying timescales, and many FBA studies in complex organisms typically either ignore time as a parameter, or integrate data taken over long timescales (days/weeks). In this work, we adopt and modify a previously published machine learning approach that hybridized several aspects of a constraint-based approach with machine-learning in order to predict growth. This study introduces a Machine Learning-FBA framework for plant tissues that accommodates transient state dynamics, at the cost of violating the steady-state assumption, in order to enable more accurate flux estimation in plant tissues. For our case study we reconstruct the metabolism of the plastid of Poplar and Sorghum, integrating data sampled from leaf tissue under varying levels of iron bioavailability. We show that the approach gives us more realistic insights into plastidial metabolism, indicates where our metabolic reconstruction could be improved, and still allows us to draw novel hypotheses on the impact of metal bioavailability on plant leaves.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

In this work, we demonstrate that introducing sequence-dependent chain rigidity enables the accurate reproduction of the elastic and viscous moduli for experimentally characterized condensates of A1-LCD and its numerous mutants. Furthermore, we show that the frequency-dependent loss factor can be described by a single parameter that universally correlates with viscosity across different sequences and variations of the coarse-grained molecular energy function. Our results also reveal that increased chain rigidity, indicated by a larger gyration radius, expands the condensates elastic regime.

These mechanical forces are fundamental regulators of biomolecular structures and functions. However, most single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques primarily exert force along a single axis, thereby failing to recreate the mechanical environments experienced by biomolecules in cells. Here, we present a molecular tool comprising a multi-axial entropic spring tweezer along rigid DNA origami (MAESTRO), which utilizes ssDNA entropic springs to apply forces in the piconewton (pN) range and is designed to examine the dynamics of biomolecules under defined multi-axial tensions. Combining MAESTRO, single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and Bayesian non-parametric FRET (BNP-FRET) enables high-throughput study of biomolecules under different complexities of multi-axial tension forces. We demonstrate our tension-inducing molecular tool on Holliday junction (HJs)---intermediate DNA structures important in the homologous recombination process. Instead of faster kinetics under tension, we discovered [&ge;] 5x slower kinetics of the HJ conformations under multi-axial tension than under tension-free conditions, which in turn permits direct observations of intermediate open and unstacked HJ conformations. Notably, under four-way tension, we observed clear evidence of inter-conversion between several different kinetic patterns in many individual HJs, previously believed to be non-interconverting owing to the rugged energy landscape of the system. In addition to controlling conformational dynamics, we show that the tension experienced by HJ also mechanically tunes the functional outcome of T7 endonuclease I, a junction-resolving enzyme that recognizes HJ and catalyzes two cleavage sites within the junction. By overcoming the limitations of single-axial force spectroscopy, we envision that MAESTRO's versatile multi-axial tension capability will enable high-throughput investigation of complex, previously unseen dynamics and probe the mechanoregulation of many biomolecules.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

W.; McKay, M.; Wu, X.; Granger, J. M.; Williams, Y.; Bogner, M.; Kang, T.; Seyfried, A.; Toksoy, Z.; Cacheux, M.; Young, L. H.; Akar, F. G.", "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major complication of obesity, yet it remains unclear whether early metabolic stress, prior to the onset of overt obesity or structural remodeling, can independently promote arrhythmias. In vitro studies suggest that fatty acids can allosterically activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key metabolic sensor known to preserve myocardial viability and mitochondrial function following ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. We hypothesized that AMPK signaling critically modulates the electrophysiological (EP) response to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic stress. Methods: To test this, wild-type (WT) and AMPK kinase-dead (AMPK-KD) mice were subjected to an 8-week HFD regimen beginning at 4 weeks of age. Controls remained on normal diet (ND) for the same duration. Arrhythmia susceptibility was assessed ex vivo using rapid pacing and I/R challenge protocols. Changes in the EP substrate were defined by high-resolution optical action potential mapping. Underlying mechanisms were probed using western blotting, confocal and transmission electron microscopy. Results: HFD-fed wild-type (WT) hearts did not display increased arrhythmia susceptibility in response to either burst pacing or I/R challenge. On the contrary, they exhibited a paradoxical enhancement in post-ischemic EP recovery compared to ND-fed controls. This improvement was associated with increased phosphorylation of canonical AMPK targets, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and raptor, consistent with the activation of a cardioprotective metabolic program. In sharp contrast, AMPK-deficient (AMPK-KD) hearts demonstrated heightened vulnerability to inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT), irrespective of diet. Conduction slowing emerged as an early EP abnormality in these hearts and served as the initial substrate (or 'first hit') that promoted their increased incidence of non-sustained VT. Notably, this conduction impairment arose in conjunction with an increase (rather than decrease) in Cx43 and Nav1.5 protein expression. Mechanistically, defective conduction in AMPK-KD hearts was linked to impaired autophagic degradation of intercalated disc proteins resulting from reduced phosphorylation of ULK1, a downstream effector of AMPK. Consequently, unphosphorylated Cx43 accumulated at the intercalated disc, likely replacing phosphorylated isoforms (p-Cx43). In addition, AMPK-KD hearts exhibited swollen, fragmented mitochondria and reduced levels of mitochondrial fusion proteins. Upon HFD challenge, this vulnerable mitochondrial substrate generated excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) coinciding with accelerated repolarization. Together, impaired conduction and ROS-driven action potential shortening promoted VT sustenance in HFD-fed AMPK-deficient hearts. Conclusions: Our findings identify AMPK as a key metabolic regulator that integrates redox balance, mitochondrial integrity, and protein homeostasis to preserve cardiac excitability during early nutrient overload. Loss of AMPK signaling, as occurs with aging and advanced metabolic disease, may therefore represent a pivotal mechanism linking HFD to increased SCD risk.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Ultrasensitive transcriptional switches are essential for converting gradual molecular inputs into decisive gene expression responses, enabling critical behaviors such as bistability and oscillations. While cooperative binding, relying on direct repressor-DNA binding, has been classically regarded as a key ultrasensitivity mechanism, recent theoretical works have demonstrated that combinations of indirect repression mechanisms--sequestration, blocking, and displacement--can also achieve ultrasensitive switches with greater robustness to transcriptional noise. However, these previous works have neglected key biological constraints such as DNA binding kinetics and the limited availability of transcriptional activators, raising the question of whether ultrasensitivity and noise robustness can be sustained under biologically realistic conditions. Here, we systematically assess the impact of these factors on ultrasensitivity and noise robustness under physiologically plausible conditions. We show that while various repression combinations can reduce noise, only the full combination of all three indirect mechanisms consistently maintains low noise and high ultrasensitivity. As a result, biological oscillators employing this triple repression architecture retain precise rhythmic switching even under high noise, and even when activators are shared across thousands of target genes. Our findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the frequent co-occurrence of these repression mechanisms in natural gene regulatory systems.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCells must make accurate decisions in noisy environments using limited molecular resources. One essential tool for this is the ultrasensitive transcriptional switch, which enables sharp transitions in gene expression. While cooperative binding has long been viewed as the primary mechanism behind ultrasensitivity, it is highly sensitive to molecular noise. Our study explores how cells overcome this limitation by combining three indirect repression mechanisms: sequestration, blocking, and displacement. We show that this triple-repression architecture not only generates ultrasensitivity but also ensures noise robustness under physiologically realistic conditions--even when a single pool of transcription factors regulates thousands of genes. These findings reveal a biologically feasible strategy for noise-resilient transcription and offer a mechanistic explanation for why these repression strategies frequently co-occur in natural systems.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

L.; Meyer, T.; Hay, M.; Rust, N. C.", "abstract": "While humans and other primates are generally quite good at remembering the images they have seen, they systematically remember some images better than others. Here, we leverage the behavioral signature of \"image memorability\" to resolve a puzzle around how the brain transforms seeing into familiarity. Namely, the neural signal driving familiarity reports is thought to be repetition suppression, a reduction in the vigor of the population response in brain regions including inferotemporal cortex (ITC). However, within ITC, more memorable images evoke higher firing rate responses than less memorable ones, even when they are repeated. These two observations appear to conflict: if reduced firing leads to stronger memory signaling, then why are the images that induce greater firing more memorable? To resolve this paradox, we compared neural activity in ITC and the hippocampus (HC) as two rhesus monkeys performed a single-exposure image familiarity task. We found evidence that the paradox is resolved in HC where neural representations reflected an isolated memory signal that was larger for more memorable images, but HC responses were otherwise uncorrupted by memorability. Memorability behavior could not be accounted for by trivial computations applied to ITC (like thresholding). However, it could be decoded from ITC with a linear decoder that corrects for memorability modulation, consistent with the hypothesis that ITC reflects familiarity signals that are selectively extracted through medial temporal lobe (MTL) computation. These results suggest a novel role for the MTL in familiarity behavior and shed new light on how the brain supports familiarity more generally.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Although much is known about oligodendrocyte development, how the myelin dynamically forms remains unclear. Here we show the preferentially unidirectional extension of developing myelin mediated by Wnt gradient and required for proper axon functions. Using larval zebrafish as an in vivo model, we found that developing myelin in the spinal cord preferentially extends to the anterior end, and this process is dependent on an anterior-to-posterior Wnt4b gradient. Taking advantage of the large size of Mauthner-cell axons, we further showed that disruption of this directional extension impairs the even length distribution of myelin sheaths and faithful transduction of action potentials along the axon, and reduces the reliability of escape behavior. Thus, our study reveals a novel process for precise regulation of myelination, providing a new insight into myelin structuring and functioning.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

New approaches are needed to scale individual-level movement processes in a way that accounts for ecological variation.\n\nMethodsWe developed a modeling framework to predict movement distance and habitat selection across large geographic areas using GPS telemetry data from 564 wild pigs collected in 25 studies across the United States. Movement distances were modeled using gamma distribution parameters, and habitat selection was modeled using integrated step selection analysis. We used gradient-boosted regression models with nested cross-validation to optimize predictions and reduce overfitting. To account for spatial non-stationarity in habitat preference, individuals were grouped by habitat availability.\n\nResultsOur framework captured broad-scale spatial and temporal variation in movement behavior. Mean daily movement distances ranged from 152 to 1,404 meters, with the greatest seasonal variation observed in northern populations. Habitat selection models revealed consistent preference for wetlands and avoidance of croplands, with variation in other land types depending on the local ecological context. Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses indicated greater model reliability in subsets with more individuals, sites, and land types.\n\nConclusionsThis framework offers a scalable approach to predicting animal movement across heterogeneous landscapes. It enables estimation of movement parameters in regions lacking local telemetry data, supporting more informed decision-making for invasive species management, disease control, and conservation planning.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

However, it is still debatable whether many small-effect mutations or a few large-effect mutations underlie rapid adaptation, and how this knowledge can predict population survival or extinction. To address this question, we performed a series of ecologically grounded forward-in-time genetic simulations to study rapid adaptation and extinction with increasing magnitudes of environmental change. These simulations were seeded with genomic variation of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana to have a realistic genomic structure, with one (monogenic) to 1,000 (polygenic) variants with varying heritabilities contributing to an environmental adaptive trait. Our results revealed two distinct scenarios of rapid adaptation and population rescue. Under small to moderate environmental shifts, high polygenic traits increased evolutionary rescue probability. Under extreme environmental shifts, high polygenic traits lead predictably to extinction, yet monogenic traits sometimes produce one-off winning adaptive genotypes. We interpret our rapid evolutionary rescue findings in terms of the fundamental theorem of natural selection, where monogenic and polygenic traits differ in how they create stable versus skewed fitness variance (Vw) and how they respond to environmental shifts. These results highlight the insights genomics gives us into the (un)predictability of species evolutionary responses to global change, with management implications for assisted adaptation conservation.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

SLN biopsy (SLNB) determines if metastasis has occurred. Traditionally, SLNB involves injecting a Technetium-labeled tracer peritumourally, pre-operative imaging with SPECT to locate the SLN, and surgery guided by a gamma probe to remove them. Limitations include short tracer half-life which can make scheduling the SLNB difficult, and radiation dose to patients and healthcare workers. Alternatively, magnetic localization, with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as the tracer and a magnetometer to detect SPIONs in the SLN during surgery can be used, however, this lacks pre-operative imaging. Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a new imaging modality that directly detects SPIONs, holding potential for pre-operative imaging in magnetic SLNB. SPIONs for SLNB should have rapid drainage, high SLN accumulation, and high specificity to the SLN. For MPI Lymphography (MPIL), high particle sensitivity is also important. This study assesses the in vivo pharmacokinetics for SLN mapping with MPIL in a murine model, using five commercially available SPIONs of varying iron core sizes and surface coatings. We show that some SPIONs provide higher MPI signal at the SLN and show the potential to detect higher echelon nodes (HENs).

While primarily known for regulating VGCC function, CaV{beta} proteins also have channel-independent roles, including gene expression modulation. Among these, CaV{beta}1 is expressed in skeletal muscle as multiple isoforms. The adult isoform, CaV{beta}1D, localizes at the triad and modulates CaV1 activity during Excitation-Contraction Coupling (ECC). In this study, we investigated the lesser-known embryonic/perinatal CaV{beta}1 isoforms and their roles in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation, maturation, and maintenance. We found that CaV{beta}1 isoform expression is developmentally regulated through differential promoter activation. Specifically, CaV{beta}1A is expressed in embryonic muscle and reactivated in denervated adult muscle, alongside the known CaV{beta}1E isoform. Nerve injury in adult muscle triggers a shift in promoter usage, resulting in re-expression of embryonic/perinatal Cacnb1A and Cacnb1E transcripts. Functional analyses using aneural agrin-induced AChR clustering on primary myotubes demonstrated that these isoforms contribute to NMJ formation. Additionally, their expression during early postnatal development is essential for NMJ maturation and long-term maintenance.

Phylogenetic distance is a key measure used to develop species lists for host specificity tests that delimit the fundamental and realised host range of candidate weed biocontrol agents to meet the assumptions of the centrifugal phylogenetic method. Plant pathogens and insects, even those with broad host ranges, exhibit some degree of phylogenetic conservatism in their host plant associations. Thorough host-specificity testing is crucial to minimise the risk of off-target damage by biocontrol agents to native and economically important plant species. To facilitate this, host test lists need to be developed from an understanding of evolutionary relationships, usually visualised as a phylogenetic tree generated from genetic data, together with plant functional traits and geospatial information. Currently, the process of obtaining a host test list is not standardised, and the manual steps are time-consuming and challenging. 2. We introduce a user-friendly visualisation tool called PhyloControl to aid researchers in their decision-making during biocontrol risk analysis. PhyloControl integrates taxonomic data, molecular data, spatial data, and plant traits in an intuitive interactive interface, empowering biocontrol practitioners to summarise, visualise and analyse data efficiently. 3. Comprehensively sampled phylogenetic trees are often unavailable, and older published phylogenies often lack branch resolution and support, which increases uncertainty.

O.; Kaffman, A.", "abstract": "Attachment theory offers an important clinical framework for understanding and treating negative effects of early life adversity. Attachment styles emerge during critical periods of development in response to caregivers ability to consistently meet their offsprings needs. Attachment styles are classified as secure or insecure (anxious, avoidant, or disorganized), with rates of insecure attachment rising in high-risk populations and correlating with a plethora of negative health outcomes throughout life. Despite its importance, little is known about the neural basis of attachment. Work in rats has demonstrated that limited bedding and nesting (LB) impairs maternal care and produces abnormal maternal attachment linked to increased pup corticosterone. However, the effects of LB on attachment-like behavior have not been investigated in mice where additional genetic and molecular tools are available. Furthermore, no group has utilized home-cage monitoring to link abnormal maternal care with deficits in attachment-like behavior. Using home-cage monitoring, we confirmed a robust increase in maternal fragmentation among LB dams. Abnormal maternal care was correlated with elevated corticosterone levels on post-natal day seven (P7) and a stunted growth trajectory that persisted later in life. LB did not alter maternal buffering at P8 or maternal preference at P18, indicating that certain attachment-like behaviors remain unaffected despite exposure to high levels of erratic maternal care. However, LB pups vocalized less in response to maternal separation at P8, did not readily approach their dam at P13, and exhibited higher anxiety-like behavior at P18, suggesting that LB induces avoidant-like attachment deficits in mice.\n\nSignificance StatementThe impoverished conditions of limited bedding and nesting (LB) cause erratic maternal care and elevated corticosterone levels in rat and mouse pups. The increase in corticosterone levels causes attachment-like deficits in rat pups; however, it remains unclear whether similar deficits are observed in mice, where additional genomic and molecular tools are available. Using continuous home-cage monitoring, we confirmed a substantial increase in erratic maternal care and elevated corticosterone levels in 7-day-old mouse pups. LB mouse pups exhibited attachment-like deficits in some, but not all, tests, underscoring the robustness of this evolutionarily conserved bond. Despite some similarities, the attachment abnormalities observed in mice differed from previous reports in rats, paving the way for in-depth mechanistic studies in mice.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Although information is processed and represented across distributed neural ensembles, a critical question remains: How do these populations accumulate information and interact over time to form stable, coherent representations? The cortex comprises ensembles of interacting populations that cooperate to enable thought. However, an open challenge is to map how each population evolves its internal context in response to incoming information and crucially, how this evolving context shapes what each population communicates to other populations. To address this, we employ a customized variant of the Graph Echo State Network (Graph ESN) architecture that involves specialized populations. This formulation enables the model to disentangle and represent multi-scale oscillatory patterns in neural data, offering a more biologically plausible and task-relevant alternative to traditional ESNs. By leveraging the rich hidden-state dynamics of this architecture, we illustrate how neural ensembles iteratively interact and converge toward stable, temporally evolving representations of information. We further investigate the distinct contributions of individual populations in this collaborative process of representational stabilization. Mapping this temporally unfolding, cooperative structure sheds light on the neural mechanisms underlying distributed representation and inter-population coordination--processes that may ultimately support organized cognition.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

To date, the phenotype of PL neurons that undergo EE-induced adaptations has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we used brain slice electrophysiology to investigate how EE modulated intrinsic excitability in the general population of PL interneurons and pyramidal cells. Additionally, we used retrograde tracing and the neuronal activity marker Fos to investigate how EE modulated cue-evoked recruitment of pyramidal cells projecting to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) and nucleus accumbens core (NAc). Before the cue-evoked sucrose seeking test, EE enhanced the general, baseline excitability of inhibitory interneurons, but not pyramidal cells, thereby promoting inhibitory overdrive. During cue-evoked sucrose seeking, EE suppressed recruitment of PVT-, but not NAc-projecting, neurons thereby selectively promoting corticothalamic, but not corticoaccumbens, excitatory underdrive. Collectively, we further illuminate EE's anti-food seeking actions whereby EE promotes both cell type-specific (inhibitory interneuron overdrive) and circuit-specific (excitatory corticothalamic underdrive) neuroadaptations in the PL.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Domestic avian species are more tractable models for understanding the genetic architecture of plumage pigmentation, but the relevance of domestic phenotypes to plumage patterns observed in the wild is not clear. Here, we used comparative genomic approaches to examine coding variation in EDNRB2, a candidate gene associated with loss of plumage melanin in several species, in representative genomes from a diverse array of wild and domestic birds. We found widespread coding variation in EDNRB2 and in other pigmentation genes with limited pleiotropic roles in development. We also found that EDNRB2- mediated melanin loss may play a critical role in establishing bright non-melanin plumage colors.

The unidirectional movement of kinesin-1 has traditionally been explained by an ATP-dependent power stroke action of the neck linker, connecting its two catalytic domains (heads), that biases the diffusional motion forward (biased-diffusion). However, recent studies on synthetic molecular motors have supported a Brownian ratchet mechanism based on kinetic asymmetry between two locations (biased-binding), and which of these mechanisms applies to biological motors remains debated. Here, we engineered a two-headed kinesin that alternately uses these mechanisms to step forward, allowing us to investigate how they contribute to unidirectional movement. The tethered head that uses biased-diffusion frequently rebound to the rear-binding site but eventually stepped forward, as the front head remained securely bound to the microtubule. The biased-binding mechanism proved more efficient by preventing rebinding of the detached head and was independent of ATP binding. Instead, ATP hydrolysis energy is primarily consumed to ensure preferential detachment of the rear head.

In mammals, transcriptional activator STRA8-MEIOSIN mediates the decision to enter the meiotic cell cycle by triggering the G1-to-meiotic S phase transition. However, the molecular basis by which mammalian germ cells prevent continued mitotic cycling before entering the meiotic cell cycle remains unclear. Here, we investigate MEIOC's role in the mitosis-to-meiosis transition during mouse oogenesis by analyzing proliferation, cell cycle transcriptomics, and cell cycle-associated protein expression. MEIOC was previously shown to destabilize mRNA and repress the mitotic program after meiotic entry. Here, we demonstrate that MEIOC prevents continued mitotic cycling prior to meiotic entry in oogenic cells. We find that the mitosis-to-meiosis transition involves the repression of G1/S cyclin CCNA2 at the transcript and protein levels, and that MEIOC downregulates CCNA2 protein expression. In addition, MEIOC promotes entry into meiotic S phase by increasing Meiosin transcript abundance and consequently activating the STRA8-MEIOSIN transcription factor. Given that STRA8-MEIOSIN upregulates Meioc expression, MEIOC and STRA8-MEIOSIN form a positive feedback loop to reinforce timely meiotic initiation. We also demonstrate that BMP signaling halts mitotic cycling and promotes meiotic entry by upregulating MEIOC. We conclude that, in mouse oogenic cells, the transition from mitosis to meiosis occurs as two molecularly regulated steps - (i) halt of mitotic cycling and (ii) entry into the meiotic cell cycle - and that MEIOC modifies the cell cycle program to facilitate both steps in this transition.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

An important contribution to these comes from experimental high-throughput techniques such as yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), which provide evidence for direct, binary PPIs. Consequently, although protein function often emerges from interactions within multi-protein assemblies, most PPI networks focus on binary relationships. Higher-order motifs, such as protein triplets, can reflect cooperative or competitive binding events crucial for cellular function. However, distinguishing these interaction types systematically from a network of binary PPIs remains challenging. To address this issue, we present a computational framework to predict cooperative and competitive interactions among protein triplets in the human Protein Interaction Network (hPIN). By embedding the hPIN into two-dimensional hyperbolic space using the LaBNE+HM algorithm, we extracted latent geometric coordinates for each protein. Combined with topological features and biological annotations, these were used to train a Random Forest classifier on structurally validated triplets from Interactome3D. Our model achieved strong performance (AUC = 0.88), identifying angular and hyperbolic distances as two of the most predictive features. Cooperative triplets were characterized by longer common proteins and a lower frequency of paralogous partners, indicating distinct structural and evolutionary features compared to competitive cases. Structural evaluation using AlphaFold 3 confirmed that cooperative triplets exhibit distinct binding sites, whereas competitive ones share overlapping interfaces.

J.; Howard, G.", "abstract": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins play critical roles in plant development, reproduction, and environmental responses. However, their biochemical characterization in plants remains limited. LORELEI, a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein involved in pollen tube reception and early seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana, has lacked direct biochemical evidence confirming its glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring. This study employed biochemical approaches to validate LORELEI as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of wild-type LORELEI fused to a reporter protein in vegetative tissues associates with a detergent-resistant membrane fraction and is sensitive to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific cleavage enzymes, thereby confirming that it is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. Moreover, we show that mutations in the {omega}-sites or the glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment signal of LORELEI disrupt its membrane localization, highlighting the necessity of these structural elements for proper glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring. Analysis of a reporter-fused LORELEI protein in the loss of function mutant of glycosylphosphatidylinositol 8, which encodes the catalytic subunit of glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase complex involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition, results in the appearance of prominent higher molecular weight bands, further supporting its role in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring of the LORELEI protein. This study provides direct biochemical evidence confirming LORELEI as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein and sheds light on the structural determinants required for its glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring. Additionally, our study demonstrates that heterologous ectopic expression of LORELEI in vegetative tissues provides a viable alternative for the biochemical characterization of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins predominantly expressed in hard-to-access and small-sized female gametophytes. Our findings underscore the role of GPI anchoring in membrane localization and biosynthesis of GPI-anchored proteins in plants.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Ferns species within reach were counted, photographed, recorded and identified. Coordinates of each plot were recorded using GPS (Global Positioning System). Seven species belonging to five families were recorded in the study sites with a Shannon-Weiner diversity Index of 0.6325. Nephrolepis undulate was the most abundant ferns species. All fern species recorded in this study were found and distributed only in the gallery forest of the Amurum forest reserve and not the other habitat types. The study has revealed a rich and varied fern flora during early rainy season, with significant ecological and conservation value in Amurum forest reserve. The study underscores the importance of preserving fern-rich habitats, particularly in the face of environmental change.

The NanoBondy utilizes the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, harnessing NeissLock chemistry engineered from Neisseria meningitidis. We evaluated binding and specificity of a panel of nanobodies to CD45, a long-lived surface marker of nucleated hematopoietic cells. We demonstrated conversion of existing nanobodies to covalently reacting NanoBondies using a disulfide clamp to position the self-processing module of FrpA close to the nanobody antigen-binding site. Addition of calcium induces anhydride formation at the NanoBondy C-terminus and proximity-directed ligation to surface amines on CD45. We optimized NanoBondy reaction by fine-tuning linkers and disulfide clamp sites to modulate anhydride positioning. Tandem mass spectrometry mapped reaction sites between the NanoBondy and CD45. NanoBondy ligation was robust to buffer, pH and temperature and was detected within 2 minutes. We established reaction specificity of NanoBondies to endogenous CD45 at the surface of NK cells and T cells.

As compared to non-nappers, nappers showed reduced hemispheric asymmetry in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, p< 0.001) and decreased performance at high WM load levels. Only in non-nappers was increased ipsilateral activation in the DLPFC associated with better performance at high WM load levels (p < 0.05), while contralateral activation across all WM load levels was not associated with performance.

It is well-established that the motor protein kinesin is responsible for anterograde trafficking of axonal cargo, while the dynein/dynactin complex regulates retrograde trafficking. However, there is still much to uncover regarding the various isoforms of these motor proteins as well as the adapter and cargo-associated proteins involved in the precise trafficking dynamics. Here we use a targeted genetic approach to knockdown candidate kinesin genes involved in trafficking organelles like synaptic vesicles, mitochondria, and dense core vesicles in motor neurons. Using fluorescently tagged cargo proteins; live-imaging experiments were conducted to quantify intracellular trafficking changes, and 2 genes, kinesins 1 and 3, were identified as critical regulators. Disruptions in either gene product, reduce rates of axonal trafficking in motor neurons, and lead to the formation of large intracellular aggregates in somas and axons. Downstream, disruptions in both kinesin 1 and 3 expression led to significant changes in neuropeptide (NP) abundance at boutons, and changes in synaptic morphology, including innervation length, bouton number, and active zone composition. Spinning disc confocal imaging revealed fewer NP trafficking through, or getting captured in kinesin knockdown experiments, and a dramatic reduction in NP release at motor neuron terminals. We go on to show profound reductions in neuromuscular transduction, and excitation-contraction coupling in kinesin 1 knockdowns, but not for kinesin 3. Changes in larval crawling as well as development were observed for kinesin 1 knockdowns.

Conventional receptor discovery methods, such as affinity chromatography, require cell disruption and often expose intracellular proteins, resulting in high background and low specificity. To overcome these limitations, we developed a proximity labelling approach that tags proteins near VHP receptors on intact live cells. Cells were incubated with VHP-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) complexes, which, upon hydrogen peroxide treatment, activate biotin-tyramide to produce short-lived radicals that covalently label nearby membrane proteins. Using the prototypic C-end Rule peptide RPARPAR and its known receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), we validated this method by successful receptor tagging and mass spectrometric identification. Using RPARPAR-HRP conjugates, we achieved selective proximity labeling of membrane proteins in NRP-1-positive PPC1 cells, with a 3- to 5-fold increase in fluorescence intensity over controls by flow cytometry. Affinity purification and Western blotting identified a strong ~130 kDa band corresponding to NRP-1 exclusively in labeled PPC1 cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a ~20-fold enrichment of NRP-1 and significant enrichment of integrins (ITGAV, ITGB1, ITGA3), ALCAM, EPHA2, CD109, and PLXNB2 in RPARPAR-labeled samples compared to controls.

We observed that CTCF expression in the human endometrium decreases from the proliferative to the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Similarly, in cultured human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs), CTCF expression declines during in vitro decidualization. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown, we demonstrated that CTCF is essential for the early phase of decidualization but dispensable in later stages. Notably, CTCF depletion reduces the expression of HOXA11, a well-established regulator of decidualization, and overexpression of HOXA11 rescues the decidualization defects caused by CTCF loss, identifying HOXA11 as a key downstream effector of CTCF. Mechanistically, CTCF binds to the HOXA11 promoter to facilitate its transcriptional activation. Furthermore, uterine-specific knockout of CTCF in Pgr-Cre mice leads to female infertility, characterized by diminished HOXA11 expression, impaired uterine receptivity, and defective decidualization.

In this study, we investigate the effects of cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced persistent bladder sensitization to explore the lateralized contribution of amygdala calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors (CGRP-Rs) on pain-like changes in mice. We demonstrate that CYP induces hypersensitivity lasting up to 14 days post-injury (DPI) in the urinary bladder distention assay and up to 21 DPI when assessing abdominal mechanical sensitivity. Despite persistent pain-like changes, no significant bladder histological changes were observed. Based on previous findings that CGRP signaling from the parabrachial nucleus contributes to central amygdala (CeA) lateralization, we hypothesized that CGRP-Rs play a key role in driving visceral bladder pain-related hemispherical differences. We show that inhibiting CGRP-R activity with the antagonist CGRP8-37, in the right CeA attenuates bladder pain-like behavior, whereas left CeA inhibition sustains CYP-induced hypersensitivity. Electrophysiological recordings revealed increased firing frequency in CGRP-R positive cells in the right CeA 7 DPI. In vivo single photon calcium imaging demonstrated increased Ca transients in CGRP-R-positive cells in the right CeA, upon the presentation of a stimulus at 0 DPI, and overall at 2DPI, further confirming the pronociceptive role of CGRP-Rs in the right CeA.

However, gene deletion studies failed to identify a clear functional role for OCLN, despite multiple phenotypic alterations. Importantly, previous studies targeting exon 3 allowed expression of a splice variant starting at exon 4, (isoform 4) that expresses the full carboxy-terminal tail. Here we show that the OCLN carboxy-terminus forms a complex with the light intermediate chain (LIC) of dynein to link tight junction cargo to the minus end directed motor protein. Mutational analysis revealed S471 phosphorylation is required for binding to the LIC while S490 phosphorylation is required for trafficking. Expressing OCLN S490A mutant prevented endothelial cell proliferation and collateral angiogenesis. OCLN gene deletion targeting exon 5, preventing full length and isoform 4 expression, resulted in embryonic lethality. In summary, OCLN links tight junction cargo to the dynein motor, regulating trafficking in a phosphorylation dependent manner and contributing to both VEGF-induced vascular permeability and collateral angiogenesis.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

In cells, FHOD-associated LINC complexes enhance the mechanical resistance of nuclear-engaged actin cables in polarizing fibroblasts and sarcomeres in developing cardiomyocytes.

Disruption of this pathway underlies a recently identified infant-onset neurodevelopmental disorder (ENDI syndrome), characterized by profound developmental delay, microcephaly, and immune deficiency. Its most severe form, ENDI with agammaglobulinemia (ENDI-A), is driven by a bi-allelic SEL1L Cys141Tyr (C141Y) mutation within the fibronectin II (FNII) domain, for which no treatment currently exists. Here, we serendipitously uncover a striking mechanism of intrinsic rescue in knock-in mouse models of the C141Y mutation: enhanced usage of an alternative splice donor site within exon 4 bypasses the mutant FNII-encoding region, restoring ERAD activity and rescuing key disease phenotypes including perinatal lethality, growth retardation, B cell deficiency, and neurodevelopmental defects. Building on this discovery, we demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping in patient-derived fibroblasts generates a truncated yet functional SEL1L protein, fully rescuing ERAD function and ER proteostasis.

We hypothesized that membrane-bound ADAMTS13 displayed on lgRBCs could provide a durable treatment for TTP. To test this, we engineered erythroid cells expressing both wild-type and mutant variants MDTCS fragments of ADAMTS13, conferring resistance to autoantibodies. Flow cytometry and FRET-based assays confirmed robust membrane expression and enzymatic activity. Importantly, mutant MDTCS variants retained catalytic activity in the presence of plasma from TTP patients, whereas wild-type variants were inhibited.For in vivo evaluation, we generated transgenic mice expressing MDTCS ADAMTS13 on their RBC membranes. These mice exhibited normal RBC half-lives and stable, catalytically active ADAMTS13 expression. Using a murine model of TTP, where ADAMTS13 knockout mice challenged with recombinant human vWF (rhvWF) develop thrombocytopenia and schistocytes, we demonstrated that transfusion of ADAMTS13-expressing RBCs significantly mitigated disease, preventing platelet loss and schistocyte formation.

Although the SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and autophagy are two major proteostatic systems, how these pathways intersect to regulate mitochondrial integrity in metabolically active tissues remains poorly understood. Here, using adipocyte-specific genetic mouse models combined with high-resolution 2D and 3D ultrastructural imaging technologies, we reveal an unexpected synergy between SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD and autophagy in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function in brown adipocytes. Loss of ERAD alone triggers compensatory autophagy, whereas combined deletion of both pathways (double knockout, DKO) results in severe mitochondrial abnormalities, including the accumulation of hyperfused megamitochondria penetrated by ER tubules, even under basal room temperature conditions. These phenotypes are absent in mice lacking either pathway individually or in SEL1L-IRE1 DKO, highlighting the pathway-specific coordination between ERAD and autophagy. Mechanistically, dual loss of ERAD and autophagy induces ER expansion, excessive ER-mitochondria contact, upregulation of mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) tethering proteins, impaired calcium transfer, and defective mitochondrial turnover. As a result, DKO adipocytes accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria, exhibit respiratory deficits, and fail to sustain thermogenesis.

In particular, the host-virus interactions that regulate AAV gene expression and replication are not fully defined, yet they hold key insights for engineering improved recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors. Here, we identify the PP4:SMEK1/2 phosphatase complex as a host restriction factor that suppresses wildtype AAV replication. Active replication and Rep expression correlates with hyperphosphorylation of KAP1S824 and RPA2S4/8/33, known PP4 substrates. Rep proteins directly bind the HEAT/Arm domain of the SMEK1 regulatory subunit of PP4. We further reveal that the KAP1:SMEK1 interaction is mediated by a MAPP short linear motif (SLiM) that interacts with the substrate recruitment groove of the SMEK1 EVH1 domain. Rep68 disrupts this interaction and interferes with substrate recruitment by the PP4:SMEK1/2 complex, leading to substrate hyperphosphorylation. We also uncover a multifunctional complex containing PP4:SMEK1 and PP1:NIPP1, both implicated in KAP1S824 dephosphorylation.

Splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) manage the highest iron flux in the body by recycling aged red blood cells (RBCs) through erythrophagocytosis. In this study, we investigated the adaptive mechanisms employed by RPMs under systemic iron deficiency. We found that RPMs from mildly anemic, dietary iron-deficient (ID) mice exhibit a surprising enhancement in erythrophagocytic capacity, accompanied by elevated cytoplasmic labile iron levels, reduced iron stores, and increased iron-export capacity via ferroportin (FPN). Proteomic profiling, validated by flow cytometry, revealed increased mass and activity of both lysosomes and mitochondria in RPMs from ID mice, along with upregulated expression of apoptotic cell receptors. Further assays identified a marked increase in mitochondrial respiration in ID RPMs, a unique response that contrasts with prior reports of impaired mitochondrial function in iron-deficient cells. These responses occurred independently of classical M2 polarization markers. Using both in vivo and cellular models, we identified the low hepcidin-high FPN axis as a key driver of the phagocytic and metabolic rewiring in RPMs. Additionally, calcium signaling emerged as a likely mediator of this axis. Pharmacological inhibition of calcium signaling effectors pinpointed SYK kinase as a molecular switch governing the high-FPN-induced functional reprogramming of macrophages. Short-term SYK inhibition reduced the enhanced erythrophagocytic function of RPMs during iron deficiency, impairing iron utilization for extramedullary splenic erythropoiesis. Together, our findings highlight metabolic reprogramming in RPMs as a strategic adaptation that optimizes their iron recycling and utilization capacity in response to systemic iron scarcity.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we present cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human leak potassium channel K2P 6.1 (TWIK2)9-11 and mutants in nanodisc and detergent environments that reveal an unusual conformation in the first selectivity filter (SF1) and a pair of two-chain lipids within the channel cavity (denoted the \"lipid plug\"). The chains of each plug lipid occupy separate binding sites that laterally extend to the bilayer from the channel cavity. One, the upper leg, matches the previously identified alkyl chain binding site4-8,12. The second, the lower leg, occupies a fenestration common with K2P 1.1 (TWIK1)13. Together, they demonstrate a bidentate means to coordinate each plug lipid that offers a reinterpretation of previous observations. Structures of a K2P6.1 (TWIK2) mutant that directs the channel to the plasma membrane14 and an R257A mutant that increases function yield plugged and unplugged forms. Notably, the R257A plugged form shows a change in lipid plug position, indicating a key role for this residue in lipid binding. Together, our data suggest that occupation of the central cavity by the lipid plug serves as a mechanism to render the TWIK channels inactive and points to the importance of lipid plug removal to create an ion permeable pore.

Previous studies have established that phase-separated condensates composed of actin-binding proteins, such as vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and Lamellipodin (Lpd), restrict the organization of actin filaments to structures such as rings, shells, discs, and rods through kinetic trapping. However, the mechanism by which crosslinker multivalency, actin growth, and condensate properties tune actin organization and droplet shape is not well understood. Using a combination of agent-based simulations and experiments, we find that the deformability of the droplet interface allows for the emergence of not just tightly-bundled actin rings but also weakly-bundled actin discs. We find two major quantitative relationships between actin bundling and droplet deformation. The first relationship shows that the crosslinked bundle thickness and droplet diameter followed a power law, consistent with experiments. The second one is that the kinetics of droplet deformation follows a dynamic snapping behavior that depends on the droplet surface tension and the multivalent VASP-actin binding kinetics. We predicted that these two relationships were generalizable to dynamic multimers and to weak actin crosslinkers. Our predictions were experimentally tested using two additional condensate-forming proteins, lamellipodin and RGG.

In this work, we developed a model for glycocalyx-membrane-cortex composite to investigate the effects of glycocalyx and membrane-cortex adhesion on the formation of EVs by combining polymer physics-based theory and Helfrich membrane theory. By performing linear stability analysis, we show that modulating the mechanical feedback among the glycocalyx, membrane-cortex attachment, and membrane curvature can give rise to two types of instabilities: a conserved Turing-type instability and a Cahn-Hilliard-type instability. Furthermore, using an equilibrium model, we identified two critical conditions for EV formation: an initial detachment of the membrane from the underlying cortex and then a sufficient driving force to induce membrane deformation for successful EV formation. We further demonstrated that there exists an optimal glycocalyx coating area at which the formation of EVs is most favorable. Finally, we use our model to predict that a heterogeneous size distribution of EVs can be generated through the regulation of glycocalyx properties, shedding insight into how EVs of different radii may be generated.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Protein- and RNA-rich liquid-like condensates form through phase separation on and around chromatin, driving diverse condensate morphologies with varying sphericity and intra-condensate chromatin density. However, a unifying set of physical principles underlying these varied interactions and their implications for chromatin organization remains elusive. Here, we develop and experimentally validate a mesoscopic model that bridges the physics of phase separation and chromatin mechanics. Specifically, by integrating computational modeling with experiments using two canonical condensate proteins, the heterochromatin protein HP1, and the euchromatin protein BRD4, we demonstrate that wetting properties and chromatin stiffness shape condensate morphology, while condensates remodel chromatin mechanics and organization. This two-way interplay is governed by elastocapillarity (the deformation of chromatin by condensate interfacial tension) and resolves discrepancies in nuclear condensate behavior, with emergent behaviors that deviate from the simplest liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) models. Our findings underscore that nuclear condensates and chromatin cannot be studied in isolation, as they are fundamentally interdependent, impacted by biomolecularly-defined wetting properties, with implications for genome organization, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic control in diverse phenotypes, including cancer.

It was originally described in Drosophila mosaics, where heterozygous ribosomal protein (Rp+/-) mutant cells are eliminated by wild-type neighbors. The transcription factor Xrp1 mediates most of the Rp+/--associated phenotypes, including reduced competitiveness and translation. Although RpS12 is required for Xrp1 induction in Rp+/- cells, the mechanism remained unresolved. We demonstrate that RpS12, via alternative splicing, induces the Xrp1 short (Xrp1short) isoform expression in Rp+/- cells, which is both necessary and sufficient for their elimination. Strikingly, RpS12 overexpression in wild-type cells is sufficient to induce Xrp1short expression and confer a \"loser\" phenotype. While Xrp1long isoform is not required in Rp+/- cells, expression of either Xrp1 isoform is sufficient to promote the loser status in wild-type cells. We further identify Syncrip, an RNA-binding protein reduced in Rp+/- cells, as a critical Xrp1 suppressor; its depletion in wild-type cells activates Xrp1-dependent competition.

Inspired by Perrine's foundational description of Doppler effects in oscillating receivers, I hypothesised that bat ear oscillations could serve as dynamic signal modulators, introducing time-varying Doppler shifts to received echoes. I tested this hypothesis using both computational simulations and controlled experiments. In the simulations, each ear was modelled as an angularly oscillating structure receiving echoes from a CF pulse, with motion parameters systematically varied across frequency (5-50 Hz) and excursion angle (15-45 degrees). The received echoes were synthesised as composite signals comprising delayed, Doppler-shifted components based on instantaneous ear segment velocities. Results showed pronounced spectral broadening, instantaneous frequency fluctuations, and binaural disparities that scaled with tip velocity. These effects were then validated using a subwoofer-driven oscillating reflector that emulated the ear's motion while reflecting a stable 80 kHz tone. Recordings showed consistent bandwidth expansion to over 1.2 kHz at 30 Hz, with phase warping evident in the time-domain waveforms. These findings confirm that oscillatory motion alone, without source modulation or target motion, can dynamically restructure the spectral and temporal profile of echoes. I argue that in CF bats, such echo transformations represent an active encoding strategy, enabling spatial and temporal contrast enhancement within the auditory fovea. This reconceptualises ear motion not as passive filtering, but as a means of dynamically enriching incoming sensory information.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

K.; Amsalem, E.", "abstract": "Mating is a crucial event in animal life, with significant implications for individual fitness. Insects have evolved complex mating systems and behaviors, such as pheromone signaling and elaborate courtship rituals, that convey vital information about mate species, quality, and receptiveness, to optimize reproductive success. These signals are especially critical in social species where a single female found a colony following a single event of mating. In this study, we investigate the short-range signals produced by gynes (newly emerged queens) and their role in mating in Bombus impatiens. Mating in bumble bees is facilitated by males marking mating sites with long-range labial gland pheromones, which attract gynes. It is assumed that gynes produce short-range signals necessary to initiate mating. While male bumble bee sex pheromones have been extensively studied across many species, the short-range signals produced by gynes remain poorly understood. Our findings show that males rely on multimodal signals, composed of visual, vibrational, and context-dependent sex pheromones produced by gynes. Choice bioassays designed to isolate the different signals produced by gynes indicate that visual cues are essential but not sufficient for successful mating, and compounds from the labial and dufour glands likely play a role in attracting males. Our results also highlight the importance of vibrational signals for male attraction. Together, these findings underscore the role of gynes in regulating mating and the significance of context in eliciting male responses and mate selection through various signals.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

C.; Claridge-Chang, A.", "abstract": "Associative conditioning is a fundamental learning paradigm that links salient stimuli to appropriate behavior. The vinegar fly is an important memory model that can associate odors with rewarding or punishing reinforcement stimuli via distinct sets of dopaminergic neurons. While much is known about learning, a crucial question remains: is the simple co-activation of sensory and neuromodulatory dopaminergic neurons sufficient to induce memory formation? To address this, we systematically replaced natural stimuli, namely odor-evoked activity, punishment, and reward signals, with optogenetic activation of corresponding neurons, both individually and in combination. In all cases, including a full-substitution paradigm where both olfactory activity and reinforcement dopamine signals were replaced, optogenetic activation successfully implanted synthetic memories. These findings provide a clear answer: simple coincident, rectangular-pulse sensory and neuromodulatory stimulation can instruct associative memory formation. We conclude that associative memory does not have strict requirements for temporal or ensemble activity patterns in olfactory or dopaminergic neurons that are specific to natural stimuli (e.g. odorants, sugar, or pain); rather, simple coincidence is an effective driver of memory inception. These findings open new avenues for manipulating and studying memory formation with all-optical control.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

While successful in capturing fundamental learning phenomena across human and animal studies, these models are not capable of representing variability in human experiences that are common in many real-world contexts. Indeed, where variation in outcome magnitude exists (e.g., severity of illness in a medical scenario), this class of models are, at best, approximate the outcome mean with no ability to represent the underlying distribution of values. In this paper, we introduce one approach to incorporating a distributed architecture into a prediction error learning model that tracks the contingency between cues and dimensional outcomes. Our Distributed Model allows associative links to form between the cue and outcome nodes that provide distributed representation depending on the magnitude of the outcome, thus enabling learning that extends beyond approximating the mean. Comparing the Distributed Model against a Simple Delta Model across four contingency learning experiments, we found that the Distributed Model provides significantly better fit to empirical data in virtually all participants. These findings suggest human learners rely on a means of encoding outcomes that preserves the continuous nature of experienced events, advancing our understanding of causal inference in complex environments.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

However, widely used RL models, including Q-learning and its variants, fail to capture some key behavioral phenomena observed in animal experiments, particularly the dynamic switch between model-free and model-based control in the two-step task. A fundamental discrepancy is that learning is restricted to experienced outcomes in the models, whereas biological agents may generalize learning to unvisited options based on internal world models, so-called fictive learning. We propose a simple, brain-inspired fictive learning rule and conduct the rodent two-step task to examine whether fictive learning could explain the observed behavior. The learning rule uses a generalized reward prediction error to update both experienced and non-encountered states and actions. The factual prediction error is scaled by the event correlation inferred from the internal model for fictive update. The generalized reward prediction error might be supported by brain-wide dopaminergic broadcasting. Through simulations, we show that this model reproduces key behavioral traits in the two-step task, including stay probabilities and regression analysis, which common RL models fail to explain. Model fitting validates its superior fit over existing alternatives. Furthermore, the model replicates dopaminergic dynamics observed in the same task.

Local immune responses induced by AECs in the brain led to recruitment of immunosuppressive Arginase 1+ (ARG1+) macrophages and a novel population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells with eosinophilic characteristics, which we term Eo-MDSCs. We further demonstrate that Eo-MDSCs produce Maresin 2 (MaR2), a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) involved in the resolution of inflammation. In a mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), treatment of established disease with AECs induced immunological responses that resulted in reduced numbers of pathogenic macrophages and T helper (TH)17 cells, increased anti-inflammatory T cell subsets, and enhanced myelin phagocytosis, all of which led to functional recovery.

However, it is unknown how the neural populations in different PPC areas organize their activity during this process. It has been proposed that PPC activity reflects population-level dynamics rather than distinct subpopulations, raising the question of how the population flexibly reorganize between the two main phases of motor control, planning and execution. To address this question, we analyzed neural dynamics in three PPC areas (PE, PEc, V6A) in the context of a delayed reaching task, applying dimensionality reduction techniques. This approach allows identifying whether activity in each area is organized into independent or partially overlapping dynamics across task phases. We found evidence of area-specific population subspaces, distinct for movement planning and execution. Specifically, the analysis revealed that in PE, which is a predominantly somatomotor area, neural activity occupied nearly orthogonal subspaces between the two phases, suggesting independent dynamics for movement planning and execution. In contrast, in V6A and PEc, which are involved in visuomotor transformations, we identified both shared and exclusive subspaces, indicating a more flexible representation of motor information in these areas. Overall, our findings suggest that parietal circuits combine both separation and sharing of neural representation to support computations during the different movement stages, providing new insights into the role of the PPC in generating flexible motor behavior.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Cholesterol, a major component of lipid-ordered membrane domains (OMDs), has recently been identified as a critical modulator of HCN channel function. Using FLIM-FRET-based OMD probes and a fluorescent cholesterol sensor GRAM-W, we investigated the effects of cholesterol supplementation on nociceptor DRG neurons from a rat model of spared nerve injury (SNI). We developed a method to distinguish at least two phases of membrane remodeling during cholesterol enrichment: an initial phase marked by OMD expansion and increased accessible cholesterol, followed by a second phase with continued cholesterol accumulation without further OMD expansion. These cholesterol dynamics were further validated through changes in fluorescence anisotropy and homo-FRET measurements of GRAM-W. Temporal analysis of cholesterol enrichment revealed two mechanisms of HCN channel modulation: through expansion of OMDs and elevation of free cholesterol. In SNI DRG neurons with low cholesterol and small OMDs, both mechanisms are active, while in naive DRG neurons--characterized by high cholesterol and large OMDs--modulation occurs only via increased free cholesterol. These findings deepen our understanding of cholesterol's role in modulating ion channels and contributing to neuropathic pain.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

While mechanistic evidence from animal models is accumulating, direct human data on how slow-wave sleep shapes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteostasis remain limited, constraining our understanding of physiological resilience to neurodegenerative disease. Methods: Twelve healthy adults (aged 20-40 years) underwent CSF sampling following three controlled sleep conditions in a randomized crossover design; (1) one night of sleep followed by afternoon CSF sampling, (2) one night of sleep followed by morning CSF sampling, and (3) one night of total sleep deprivation followed by morning CSF sampling. Sleep and wakefulness were verified using polysomnography and actigraphy, with >4-week washout periods between conditions. Measured CSF biomarkers included Alzheimer's disease-related proteins: beta-amyloid isoforms (1-38, 1-40, and 1-42), total and phosphorylated tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light, as well as orexin, albumin (also measured in serum), and osmolality. Differences between conditions were assessed using Friedman tests with Dunn's post hoc correction. Results: CSF levels of beta-amyloid; and tau tended to be consistently lower after sleep compared with both afternoon sampling and post-sleep deprivation. Concurrently, CSF albumin levels increased after sleep, while neurofilament light and GFAP remained unchanged. Orexin levels rose markedly during sleep deprivation but showed no circadian variation. Conclusions: These findings support a model in which slow wave sleep enhances CSF turnover, reducing concentrations of specific proteins, including beta-amyloid; and tau. Understanding how sleep regulates the homeostasis of neurodegeneration-related proteins may inform strategies to mitigate disease progression.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Rather than fitting voltage traces, we fit the bifurcation structure of the target model, thereby capturing parameter heterogeneity and rich dynamics. The resulting model extends the quadratic integrate-and-fire model, with extracellular potassium accumulation altering voltage dynamics by increasing the reset voltage. We apply our systematic reduction procedure to the Wang-Buz&aacuteski model.

Determining the unique contributions of multiple myofibroblast lineages to development and disease is hampered by a lack of genetic tools to distinguish between them. In this study, we generated a Stc1CreERT2 mouse line that faithfully labels the developmentally transient secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) and distinguishes SCMFs from alveolar duct myofibroblasts (DMF) and smooth muscle. SCMF populations expand by clonal proliferation of Stc1-expressing progenitors and contract by apoptosis. We deleted the intrinsic apoptosis effectors Bax and Bak1 in the Stc1-lineage, which prevented SCMF clearance during alveologenesis. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed that residual Stc1-lineage cells lacking Bax and Bak1 lose myofibroblast identity but express a combination of SCMF and DMF marker genes. Embryonic lineage tracing identified that SCMFs and DMFs have distinct progenitor populations with unique niches, and genetic activation of developmentally important signaling pathways could not interconvert these lineages.

This physical segregation of germline from the soma has been long believed to be crucial for germline development, but the mechanisms controlling this segregation and its developmental significance remain unclear. Here, in Drosophila, we show that somatic gene silencing in the germline is essential for maintaining this segregation. We showed that primordial germ cells (pole cells) lacking the Nanos- and Polar granule component (Pgc)-dependent dual repression mechanism caused misexpression of widespread somatic genes. They formed abnormal cellular protrusions, invaded adjacent somatic epithelium, and intermingled with somatic cells. These mislocalized pole cells ultimately underwent cell death, whereas properly segregated cells survived. Notably, the knockdown of miranda (mira), one of the somatic genes expressed ectopically in the pole cells lacking this repression mechanism, rescued these phenotypes.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a contributor to hyperoxia-induced BPD. However, the effects of hyperoxia on mitochondrial function and mucociliary differentiation in the developing upper airway epithelium remain poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that hyperoxia impairs neonatal airway mucociliary differentiation by disrupting mitochondrial bioenergetic function. Neonatal tracheal airway epithelial cells (nTAECs) from term infants (n=5) were cultured in a 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) model and exposed to 60% O2 during the mid-phase of differentiation (ALI day 7-14). Cellular phenotype was assessed using immunofluorescence staining and gene expression analyses. Mitochondrial function was evaluated through Seahorse metabolic flux analysis, and global protein changes were characterized by quantitative proteomics. Hyperoxia exposure significantly impaired terminal epithelial differentiation, characterized by reductions in ciliated and goblet cells. Seahorse assay revealed a decrease in baseline oxygen consumption and mitochondrial ATP production, accompanied by a compensatory increase in glycolytic ATP production. Quantitative proteomics identified disruption of mitochondrial Complex I as a central feature of the hyperoxic response. Downstream proteomic pathway analyses further confirmed the metabolic shift from mitochondrial to glycolytic ATP production and demonstrated altered epithelial differentiation pathways, including NOTCH and TGF-{beta} signaling. These findings reveal that moderate hyperoxia impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and alters metabolic programming, leading to disrupted mucociliary differentiation.

However, floral cues are not always reliable, as flowers of different plant species often differ in terms of the qualities of their food rewards, even when flower types resemble each other. At the same time, some non-floral traits, such as leaf shape, differ reliably among plant species and might be associatively learned by bees to improve foraging success. In this laboratory study, we tested whether generalist bees (Bombus impatiens) can (1) associatively learn differences in leaf shape to discriminate rewarding from unrewarding flowers and (2) rely more on differences in leaf shape when a flower color cue is harder to discriminate. We therefore assigned bees to either of two treatments: in one treatment, rewarding and unrewarding artificial targets (\"flowers\") differed greatly in petal color, and in the other treatment, they differed little; each treatment's targets differed in leaf shape in the same way. As expected, bees learned significantly faster when flower petal colors were more dissimilar and thus relatively easier to discriminate. These bees also learned and recalled the correct combination of petal color and leaf shape. Yet when petal colors differed relatively little, bees had a much harder time learning petal color and did not show evidence of having remembered leaf shape. Our results demonstrate that leaf shape is a cue that foraging bees can learn to associate with a pollen food reward. However, leaf shape may be learned secondarily to, or only in combination with floral cues (such as petal color).

Although originally formulated in the context of operant choice, matching also applies to time allocation in foraging and to Pavlovian responses, indicating its generality across behavioral domains. However, empirical evidence has thus far been largely limited to vertebrates and arthropods. Addressing the broader applicability of this principle requires extending investigations beyond these taxonomic groups, across a wider phylogenetic spectrum. Here, we examined phototactic behavior in the acoel flatworm Praesagittifera naikaiensis, a species that acquires nutrients through photosynthesis by symbiotic algae and exhibits positive phototaxis. Using a custom-designed T-maze in which the number of illuminated LEDs varied across arms, we found that the animals distributed themselves in proportion to relative brightness, consistent with matching behavior. Moreover, prior exposure to light for twenty-four hours attenuated this pattern. This manipulation was intended to induce a state of nutritional sufficiency, and the resulting decline in phototactic responses suggests that internal physiological states can modulate even seemingly reflexive locomotor behaviors.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Organisms are not just passive recipients of environmental pressures but are able to shape the environment they experience. Yet, the mechanisms and the evolutionary implications of such niche construction remain poorly understood. Here, we study these effects in the gazelle dung beetle (Digitonthophagus gazella). Larvae of this species develop in an underground brood chamber (a so-called brood ball) consisting of cow dung which serves as a sole source of food for a single developing larva. Throughout its development, the larva extensively modifies its environment by constantly eating, regurgitating, and shaping particle sizes within the brood ball. Previous research suggests that these larval manipulations increase environmental quality and nutrient availability. However, how larval modifications affect larval growth and how these modifications differ between species remain poorly understood. We studied the impact of larval environmental modifications by transplanting eggs into previously modified or unmodified environments, whilst controlling for the confounding effect of maternally derived microbes. Additionally, we also studied how D. gazella larvae grow in an environment that was modified by a different species (Onthophagus binodis) to investigate species-specific differences of niche construction. Counter to expectations, we found that larval modifications by conspecifics did not confer a fitness benefit to D. gazella. However, surprisingly, individuals developing in a brood ball that was modified by a heterospecific individual emerged significantly quicker. These findings thus provide mixed support for the hypothesis that environmental modifications by a larva enhance its growth. Our research adds to the growing literature on the complex interactions between organisms and their environment and how those interactions feedback on organismal development and performance.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Birds often show plasticity in nest defense depending on factors such as threat level, mate presence, nest stage, and body condition. Such factors can vary over temporal extents ranging from a diel cycle to a breeding season or an individual's lifetime. Understanding diurnal variation in nest defense intensity can be particularly useful when studying a breeding population to help investigators minimize nest disturbance, yet few studies have explored diurnal variation in nest defense intensity. Here we investigated how nest defense by Herring Gulls (Larus smithsonianus) varies with time of day. We simulated predatory threat at 26 Herring Gull nests during four different times of day: Early Morning (0530-0600), Late Morning (1000-1030), Afternoon (1400-1430), and Evening (1900-1930). Based on previous findings of diurnal activity patterns in a Herring Gull, we predicted that nest defense intensity - measured as aggressiveness of response and latency to calm - would be greater during the early morning and late evening than at other times. Contrary to our prediction, we found that the time of day did not affect nest defense intensity in Herring Gulls. However, independent of time of day, we found that when both mates were present at the nest, aggression scores were elevated. Our results suggest that joint nest defense in Herring Gulls permits greater aggressiveness towards predators, perhaps due to division of labor or lowered risk of complete nest failure if one parent is injured or killed. Further, our results indicate that researchers can minimize nest disturbance and accompanying stress by limiting research activities at Herring Gull nests when both parents are present.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Pupil size can serve as a biomarker for the autonomic nervous system balance as well as for identifying brain states. While internal states can also be self-reported when awake, automated detection and non-invasive monitoring is crucial during sleep and reduced consciousness. Here, we introduce iSleep, an innovative pupil tracking and analysis framework for sleep in humans. It features comfortable, humidified eye-tracking goggles and a platform for integrated analysis and prediction capabilities. We show that iSleep allows safe and continuous access to binocular pupil size and ocular dynamics during sleep and anesthesia. iSleep reveals that pupillary fluctuations correlate tightly with brain activity, heartbeat, and breathing, and can reliably predict brain states. Pupil constrictions reflect parasympathetic drive and likely serve a protective function for deep sleep stability; while dilations indicate arousals. Unexpectedly, we observed a decoupling of binocular movements during periods of sleep, indicating alterations in reflexes which usually govern voluntary eye movements. Finally, iSleep was tested in surgery patients under general anesthesia, revealing dynamic pupil changes to noxious stimuli, suggesting the potential for nociception monitoring during surgeries. In summary, iSleep offers an easy-to-use, robust alternative to read out brain states during sleep and anesthesia, opening new avenues in monitoring, diagnostics, and treatments, previously obscured by closed eyelids.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Several theories - such as the exploration-exploitation hypothesis - propose that variability plays a key role in motor performance and learning. However, empirical measures of motor and proprioceptive precision are often limited by small sample sizes, and proprioceptive estimates, especially those relying on efferent signals, are difficult to isolate and quantify. In this study, we leveraged a large dataset of 270 participants - including a subsample of older adults (ages 54-84) - to assess the precision of hand movements and proprioceptive estimates, and to examine whether these factors predict individual differences in motor learning and adaptation. We found that baseline reach variance did not predict learning or changes in hand localization. Although active hand localization (which includes efferent contributions) was slightly more precise - showing an 8.6% reduction in variance - this suggests that unseen hand estimates rely primarily on proprioception. Neither motor nor sensory precision varied with age. However, reach aftereffects were modestly associated with proprioceptive precision before training and proprioceptive recalibration after training. No other measure of learning or variance was reliably associated. These findings suggest that reach aftereffects may partly reflect changes in hand proprioception, but overall, we identified no predictors of adaptation to a rotated visual cursor.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Modeling pan-neuronal loss of Drosophila orthologs of a set of insomnia genes reveals a broad range of sleep phenotypes. Through systematic characterization of traits related to sleep quantity, timing, and quality, we identify genetic factors that co-regulate aspects of the insomnia-associated phenotypic landscape. Out of the 75 insomnia-associated genes identified, only 1/3 had at least one Drosophila ortholog that regulated overall sleep quantity. In contrast, 1/3 of the insomnia-associated genes had at least one Drosophila ortholog that regulated either sleep timing or sleep quality, without impacting sleep quantity.

Using a duration reproduction task, participants viewed affective images drawn from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) to induce high-arousal (positive or negative) or low-arousal (neutral) emotional states. We found that participants consistently overestimated durations in high-arousal conditions compared to those in low-arousal conditions, regardless of valence. Crucially, serial dependence effects were significantly amplified during high-arousal states. This effect was strongest when high-arousal trials were preceded by similar high-arousal trials, indicating a state-dependent intensification of sequential bias. Emotional valence, by contrast, had no significant effect on either temporal distortion or serial dependence.

While the pathways underlying seizure rhythmicity remain poorly understood, it seems likely that a contribution from the biological clock is involved. A better understanding of any such contribution may translate to better treatments. Here, the influence of the 24 h circadian rhythm on seizure activity in Drosophila melanogaster is investigated. Seizure-susceptible bang-sensitive julius seizure (jus) mutants were subjected to mechanically induced seizure at six different zeitgeber points. A clear sex-dependent phenotype was observed, with seizure severity showing a greater time-of-day effect in females, than males. The temporal pattern of seizure recovery time was bimodal, exhibiting both a morning and an evening peak. Rearing flies in constant light, which renders the molecular clock dysfunctional, abolished the seizure rhythm. Conversely, female seizure mutants reared in constant darkness, allowing free running of the circadian clock, continued to exhibit a bimodal rhythm of seizure severity. These findings support a role for the biological clock in seizure activity, at least in female Drosophila. Thus, this study validates Drosophila as a potential model for the identification of mechanisms modulating seizure rhythmicity, with the potential to aid future treatment of epilepsy.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Single-cell RNAseq analysis revealed GPR68 is also expressed in colonic sensory neurons, prompting us to investigate its role in acid-induced colonic nociception. Methods: Expression of GPR68 in colonic nociceptors and tissue from people with colitis was confirmed by in silico analysis of our RNAseq databases. Its contribution to disease activity was assessed using the acute dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) model of colitis. Acid-evoked sensory signalling was evaluated via colonic afferent recordings and Ca2+; imaging in DRG neurons from wild-type and GPR68-/- mice, supported by pharmacological studies using Ogerin (a GPR68 positive allosteric modulator) and Ogremorphin (a GPR68 antagonist). Results: RNAseq analysis showed GPR68 is robustly expressed in Trpv1+; colonic nociceptors and upregulated in tissue from people with inflammatory bowel disease, consistent with reduced disease activity in DSS-treated GPR68-/- mice. Genetic deletion of GPR68 abolished colonic afferent responses to acid, which were also attenuated by Ogremorphin and enhanced by Ogerin. In Ca2+;-free buffer, DRG neurons from GPR68-/- mice or those pre-treated with Ogremorphin showed significantly reduced acid-evoked intracellular Ca2+; responses. By contrast the colonic afferent and DRG Ca2+ response (in Ca2+-containing buffer) to capsaicin was comparable between tissue from wild-type and GPR68-/- mice highlighting the involvement of divergent proton-dependent cellular signalling cascades. Conclusions: These findings identify GPR68 as a key mediator of acid-induced colonic nociception and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of pain in colitis.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the sensation of itch has been hindered by the lack of functional human models. Here, we address this limitation by developing a protocol to generate induced pruriceptors (iPruriceptors) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We compared two differentiation approaches: a direct method via forced expression of transcription factors (TFs) in hPSCs, and a 2-step process through expression of TFs in hPSC-derived neural crest cells (NCCs). The 2-step protocol proved superior in inducing a transcriptional program that closely resembles that of human pruriceptors. Our optimized protocol employs forced expression of NGN1 and ISL1 to drive differentiation from NCCs into pruriceptors, enhancing the expression of known pruritogen receptors such as IL31RA, which pairs with OSMR, and HRH1. The induction of this transcriptional program leads to functional maturation of iPruriceptors. Accordingly, iPruriceptors exhibit robust responses to itch stimuli and in vivo-like itch pharmacology such as treatment with ABT-317, a JAK1 inhibitor tool compound, similar to those targeting intensive pruritus in atopic dermatitis (AD). Importantly, iPruriceptors can be generated without viral vectors or safe-harbor gene editing, using a PiggyBac-based transfection method that simplifies scalability.

Some individuals involved in alcohol consumption show an automatic approach towards alcohol-related stimuli, whereas others show avoidance, suggesting the need to understand the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying these automatic tendencies. Methods: The current study employed an Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Task (A-AAT) with electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate neural responses among individuals with alcohol approach and avoidance tendencies. Alcohol group participants were categorized into approach and avoidance subgroups based on their behavioral tendencies following A-AAT administration. Findings: Results revealed significant attenuation in P3 and FN400 amplitudes at frontal and parietal sites, respectively, in the alcohol-approach participants compared to both the alcohol-avoidance and non-alcohol participants. These findings suggest weakened controlled cue processing and impaired stimulus-response conflict resolution in individuals with stronger approach tendencies. Notably, right prefrontal activity exhibited prominent differences between the approach and avoidance groups, highlighting its potential role in regulating automatic alcohol-related responses.

Additionally, in mice exposed to both cocaine and chocolate, cortical and accumbal ensembles linked to each reward were comparable in size to reward ensembles in mice exposed only to one reward. However, reward-seeking ensembles were larger than ensembles tagged in homecage control mice across groups.

Recent studies have demonstrated its potential for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) in both primates and humans. However, current 2D fUS approaches are limited to a single brain slice, restricting the ability to decode widespread neural activity. While 3D fUS could overcome this, it demands high data throughput, increased computation, and higher temperature increases due to the requirement of a higher number of transmitted waves. To address this, we present selective-plane fUS, a method that leverages the wide field of view of row-column addressed (RCA) transducer arrays to capture activity in targeted brain regions without moving the probe. By electronically selecting imaging planes, this approach achieves higher spatio-temporal resolution with lower data and pulse repetition rate compared to 3D fUS, while preserving sensitivity to neurovascular signals. Our pipeline begins with a 3D functional activation scan to guide plane selection, followed by high frame rate focused wave (FW) imaging in coronal or sagittal slices. This method offers robust detection of visually evoked responses in rodents and reduces signal variability compared to 3D fUS. By imaging only functional regions of interest, selective-plane fUS cuts computational load by an order of magnitude, enables continuous 1000 Hz recordings, and reduces functional signal variability fivefold.

M. K.; Kohl, J.", "abstract": "Parental care is critical for the survival of altricial young and is mediated by neural circuits that are well characterised in adult rodents. Although adults can exhibit caregiving even before becoming parents, the developmental origins of this so-called alloparental behaviour remain unclear. Here, we show that alloparental behaviour in mice emerges abruptly between postnatal day (P)14 and 15, independently of prior social experience. This behavioural transition coincides with the onset of pup-specific activity in galanin-expressing medial preoptic area (MPOA-Gal) neurons, which are essential for parental behaviour in adulthood. Chemogenetic silencing of MPOA-Gal neurons abolishes caregiving in juveniles, suggesting that similar circuits control parenting across life stages. Viral trans-synaptic tracing and whole-cell recordings reveal extensive input remodelling of MPOA-Gal neurons between P14 and 15, marking a rapid transition from a highly connected, immature network to a sparser, adult-like circuit configuration. We identify microglia as key mediators of this process, as their ablation prevents both synaptic reorganisation and the emergence of alloparenting. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognised, microglia-dependent developmental switch that enables caregiving in juveniles through rapid circuit reconfiguration.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Neuronal signaling requires high rates of ATP production via the oxidative metabolism of glucose. The American bullfrog is intriguing, as this species has typical brain energy requirements for an average vertebrate but modifies synaptic physiology and metabolism after hibernation to maintain function during hypoxia and ischemia. Given the importance of the respiratory system in restoring metabolic homeostasis during emergence from underwater hibernation, work to date has addressed this response in the brainstem respiratory network. Thus, metabolic plasticity has been interpreted as an adaptation used to restart respiratory motor behavior under hypoxic conditions during the transition from skin breathing to air breathing. It remains unclear whether these improvements are specific to the brainstem regions critical for breathing versus a global response within the central nervous system (CNS). To address this question, we recorded neural activity from the spinal cord, forebrain, and brainstem respiratory network in vitro. As expected, hypoxia disrupted the function of each network in control animals. After hibernation, each network improved its activity in hypoxia compared to controls. These results suggest that plasticity that improves neural function during energy stress following hibernation reflects a global response that may impact many behaviors controlled by the CNS and is not limited to regions involved in metabolic homeostasis.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

We used transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) in twenty-nine healthy participants to interfere with neural activity in these regions and test their causal role in a within-subject, counter-balanced design across three sessions (sham, TUS-dACC, TUS-aIns). Computational modelling revealed a double dissociation, with distinct roles of both regions in learning from feedback: while TUS to the aIns changed people's tendency to overly take credit for rewards following action and to ignore punishments following inaction, TUS to dACC reduced participants' tendency to take cue valence as a reinforcer signal. Although the dACC and aIns are part of the same network and often co-activate during decision-making tasks, TUS interference reveals their distinct roles: the dACC selects feedback signals from the environment to inform subsequent choices while the aIns infers whether these signals were caused by one's own actions.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were conducted to assess molecular responses. RESULTS: HSV-1, but not TBEV, induced robust beta-Amyloid clustering, which was, however, dependent on extracellular amyloid peptides. Transcriptomic profiling revealed widespread HSV-1-induced changes, including activation of neurodegeneration-related pathways. Proteomic profiling confirmed enrichment of neurodegeneration- and senescence-associated secretome signatures. PSEN1/2 mutations did not alter the acute infection response.

Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, can be pharmacologically eliminated by inhibiting the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (e.g. with PLX5622), which is essential for their survival and proliferation. Upon inhibitor withdrawal, microglia rapidly repopulate, replenishing the central nervous system niche with naive cells. In recent years, microglia repopulation strategies have gained great interest as a means to reprogram dysfunctional microglia, while avoiding the detrimental effects of prolonged immune depletion. Despite promising short-term results, the long-term efficacy and pharmacological modulation of repopulated microglial remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether repopulated microglia after PLX5622 treatment sustains their beneficial effects over time in an AAV-hTauP301L induced model. Additionally, we assessed whether activating the cytoprotective nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) during microglial repopulation enhanced and prolonged the therapeutic outcomes. While microglial repopulation alone failed to maintain its neuroprotection in the long-term, when combined with an Nrf2 inducer, it improved cognitive deficits, reverted hippocampal neuronal loss and restored microglial phenotypes and mitochondrial energetics homeostasis, in our tauopathy-induced model. These results highlight the importance of shaping the fate of self-renewed microglia and propose Nrf2-mediated microglia repopulation as a potential pharmacological strategy for the treatment of tauopathies.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Meta-analytic functional decoding methods aim to tackle this issue by providing a quantitative estimation of behavioral profiles associated with specific brain regions. Existing methods face intrinsic challenges in neuroimaging meta-analysis, particularly in consolidating textual information from publications, as they rely on limited metrics that do not capture the semantic context of the text. The combination of large language models (LLMs) with advanced deep contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) for aligning text with images has revolutionized neuroimaging meta-analysis, potentially offering solutions to functional decoding challenges. In this work, we present NiCLIP, a contrastive language-image pretrained model that predicts cognitive tasks, concepts, and domains from brain activation patterns. We leveraged over 23,000 neuroscientific articles to train a CLIP model for text-to-brain association. We demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., BrainGPT models) outperform their base LLM counterparts. Our detailed evaluation of NiCLIP predictions revealed that performance is optimized when using full-text articles instead of abstracts, as well as a curated cognitive ontology with precise task-concept-domain mappings. Our results indicated that NiCLIP accurately predicts cognitive tasks from group-level activation maps provided by the Human Connectome Project across multiple domains (e.g., emotion, language, motor) and precisely characterizes the functional roles of specific brain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and temporoparietal junction. However, NiCLIP showed limitations with noisy subject-level activation maps.

Here we present a synapse-level, multiplexed molecular annotated reconstruction of an intact larval zebrafish brain, comprising over 170 thousand cells and 25 million synapses. Noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, hypocretinergic/orexinergic, and glycinergic neurons were identified using subcellular localization of APEX2, while glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons were inferred from the Zebrafish Mesoscopic Atlas. NM neurons with varying indegree scale-distinctly innervate various sensory-motor brain regions, exhibiting heterogeneity in synapse number and strength. As a critical NM system, individual locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NE) neurons integrate extensive brain-wide inputs displaying modality-specific spatial organization. Motor-related and sensory-related inputs preferentially target proximal and distal dendrites of these neurons, respectively. While the majority of inputs are one-to-one, approximately 16% synapse onto multiple targets, forming one-to-many connections. Notably, these shared input patterns extend across different monoaminergic systems, serving as a structural basis for coordinated neuromodulation. Our results demonstrate the organization principles of the NM system's input architecture, particularly within the LC-NE system. This brain-wide, multiplexed molecular annotated microscale reconstruction of a vertebrate brain, combined with multi-modal mesoscopic datasets, offers a reliable resource for the precise identification of diverse neuronal types within EM connectomes, and provides critical reference for elucidating the synaptic architecture principles underlying sensorimotor and NM pathways in the vertebrate brain.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

To investigate the mechanisms governing capsid size, we characterized the procapsid and mature capsid of phage D3, which expresses an icosahedral lattice with Triangulation number T=9. We found that the MCP scaffold domain binds to the interior capsid surface, acting as a clamp to constrain subunit interactions.

However, the mechanisms by which Dhh regulates Leydig lineage commitment through receptor selectivity, transcriptional effector specificity, and steroidogenic coupling remain elusive. In this study, we identified a Dhh-Ptch2-Gli1-Sf1 signaling axis that is essential for the differentiation of stem Leydig cells (SLCs) by using CRISPR/Cas9-generated dhh/ptch2 mutants of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and SLC transplantation. The loss of Dhh recapitulated mammalian phenotypes, characterized by testicular hypoplasia and androgen insufficiency. Rescue experiments with 11-ketotesterone and a Dhh agonist, in conjunction with SLC transplantation, demonstrated that Dhh regulates the differentiation of SLCs rather than their survival. In vitro knockout experiments of ptch1 and ptch2 in SLCs indicated that Patched2 (Ptch2), rather than Ptch1, serves as the receptor for Dhh in SLCs. Furthermore, in vivo genetic rescue experiments indicated that while the ptch2 mutation did not affect testicular development, the Ptch2 mutation fully rescued the developmental disorders of the testes caused by the dhh mutation, thereby further corroborating Ptch2 as the receptor for Dhh in SLCs. Additionally, the Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1, but not Gli2 or Gli3) functions as the transcriptional effector that drives the expression of steroidogenic factor 1 (sf1).

Genetic determination, transgenerational effects, and personal experience are major pathways shaping animal personalities. Among these pathways, little attention has been paid to environmental factors in the parental generation affecting offspring personality. Here we tested the effects of the maternal diet on offspring personality in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii. Mated females and males, whose mothers were fed during egg production on either cattail pollen, two-spotted spider mites, or thrips, were subjected to a battery of three to five tests each for exploration, activity, and boldness. Movement activity was assessed in the mites' familiar environment. Exploration was quantified by the latency to leave and reach novel sites or objects. Boldness was evaluated by residence in risky and benign sites. Mean behaviors were analyzed by generalized estimating equations, repeatability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients. On average, offspring from spider mite-fed mothers were the most active and those from pollen-fed mothers were the shiest. Offspring from thrips-fed mothers were more repeatable in activity than offspring from pollen- and spider mite-fed mothers. Consistently little and highly active personalities produced more eggs than inconsistent, flexible types. Only offspring from pollen-fed mothers were repeatable in boldness. Maternal diet did not influence offspring' personality in exploration. Taken together, our study suggests that the maternal diet critically influences both mean behavioral trait expression and behavioral repeatability of offspring. The ability of mothers to respond to short-term diet changes during internal egg production allows to adaptively adjust the behavior and personalities of daughters and sons within local and regional groups.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

However, previous approaches integrating such constraints fail to achieve both computational scalability to large and curved systems and accurate detection. To resolve this, here we present rejection sampling, a novel approach for integrating translational and rotational constraints into template matching. Using simulated influenza virus-like particles, we demonstrate that rejection sampling outperforms existing methods in terms of precision and recall.

We combine molecular dynamics simulations with explicit-solvent predictions of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) curves to quantify the contributions of all 20 proteinogenic amino acids to the hydration shell of the globular GB3 domain and the intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) XAO. We focus on two quantities encoded by SAXS curves: the hydration shell effect on the radius of gyration and the electron density contrast between protein and solvent. We derive an amino-acid-specific contrast score, revealing that acidic residues generate the strongest contrast with 1 to 1.5 excess water molecules relative to alanine, followed by cationic and polar residues. In contrast, apolar residues generate a water depletion layer. These trends are consistent across simulations with different water models. Around the XAO peptide, the hydration shell is generally far weaker compared to the globular GB3 domain, indicating unfavorable water--peptide packing at the IDP surface. The hydration shell effect on the radius of gyration of the IDP is strongly conformation-dependent.

For example, in 10g to 10kg birds flight speed increases with scale while wingbeat frequency decreases. Existing hypotheses propose that aerodynamic and biomechanical factors may drive these trends. Predictive simulation models have used these drivers to computationally synthesize flying birds. However, only a small number of species have been simulated and so this approach has not explained the kinematic trends observed across different scales of birds. This work uses predictive models to synthesize flight across all scales and shows that profile drag of the avian aerofoil is the key physical driver of self-selected kinematics. Profile drag causes the monotonic increase in flapping speed across scales and the near-constant ratio of flapping speed to flight speed (Strouhal number). The most efficient kinematics minimize Strouhal number to minimize the cost of transport, with the minimum cost of transport being bounded by the aerofoil maximum lift-to-drag ratio. The decrease of wingbeat frequency and increase of wing elevation amplitude with scale are attributable to balancing induced drag and the lateral component of profile drag. The modular models presented provide transparency in understanding how modelling choices influence flight predictions.

Activation of RubyACRs led to circuit-specific behavioral changes in three different neuronal groups. In glutamatergic motor neurons, activating RubyACRs suppressed adult locomotor activity.

A critical challenge arises because these functionally distinct subpopulations often coexist, and the lack of precise tools to separately monitor or manipulate them has significantly hindered efforts to dissect their specific roles in disease progression. Here, we address this gap by developing and optimizing fluorescent RNA sensors mediated by endogenous adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) for application in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes. We employed a streamlined screening methodology to enhance sensor specificity and functionality for complement component 3 (C3), a key marker predominantly associated with neuroinflammatory astrocytes, thus enabling subtype-specific tracking and providing a crucial tool for distinguishing these cells within heterogeneous populations. By integrating the biological complexity of astrocytes with the technological precision of ADAR-mediated sensing, this study establishes a robust framework for investigating astrocyte dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Using chronically implanted Utah arrays in F5c, PMd, and M1 in two male macaques, we compared the efficacy of controlling a motor BMI based on neural activity of each area. PMv decoding reached similar or even higher success rates than M1 and PMd in a 2D cursor control task, especially when controlling for the number of motion selective channels that were used by the decoder. We found similar results during a 2D robot avatar control task in a simulated 3D environment. At both the multi-unit and the population level, neural responses were highly similar during the training phase (passive observation of cursor movements) and the online decoding phase, and only a small subset of neurons modulated its selectivity for the direction of motion.

Stomatin-Like protein 2 (SLP-2) is a mitochondrial scaffold protein that regulates mitochondrial integrity and function. Here, we investigated whether SLP-2 induction can counteract aSyn-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We found that SLP-2 levels were reduced in human PD brains and an A53T aSyn mouse model. Mild overexpression of SLP-2 improved mitochondrial function, reduced oxidative stress, and prevented aSyn-mitochondria interactions in human iPSC-derived neurons. In vivo, SLP-2 overexpression protected dopaminergic neurons and motor function, while its depletion exacerbated degeneration and motor deficits in both mouse and Drosophila models.

To assess whether these characteristics are shared with AOENs in other areas of the AOE network, we performed the first large-scale neural recordings during action execution and action observation in multiple frontal areas including dorsal premotor (PMd) area F2, primary motor (M1) cortex, ventral premotor area F5p, frontal eye field (FEF) and 45B. In all areas, AOENs displayed highly phasic responses during specific epochs of the action video and strong responses to simple movements of an object, similar to F5c. In addition, the population dynamics in PMv, PMd and M1 showed a shared representation between action execution and action observation, with an overlap that was as large as the overlap between action execution and passive viewing of simple translation movements.

Even during sleep, respiration rhythms modulate sleep-related oscillations. While the basal ganglia are known to play roles in both sleep and respiratory regulation, their interaction with respiration rhythms remains poorly understood. Here, we examined respiration-neural couplings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the primary motor cortex (M1) across multiple states in mice, including non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, quiet wakefulness, and anesthesia. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) from M1 and SNr along with diaphragm muscle activities revealed state-dependent, region specific patterns of respiration-neural coupling. Coupling strength in both SNr and M1 was attenuated during NREM sleep compared to REM sleep and quiet wakefulness. However, under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, coupling was markedly enhanced in the SNr, but not in M1, indicating region-specific sensitivity to arousal and anesthesia state. Notably, respiration-neural coupling was systematically related to delta sub-band power; coupling strength was reduced with increased slow delta (0.5-2 Hz) and decreased fast delta (2.5-4 Hz) powers. In addition, slow delta was associated with SNr-M1 synchronization, suggesting that inter-regional communication during deep sleep may suppress respiration locking. Together, these findings highlight dynamic, state-dependent modulation of respiration-neural couplings in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, underscoring its potential role in coordinating body-brain interactions during sleep and anesthesia.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

In these same data, we have previously provided evidence for replay during on-line (non-rest) memory retrieval. Despite successful decoding of brain activity during a localizer task, and contrary to predictions, we did not detect evidence for replay during a post-learning resting state. To better understand this, we performed a hybrid simulation analysis in which we inserted synthetic replay events into a control resting state recorded prior to the actual experiment. This simulation revealed that replay detection using our current pipeline requires extremely high replay densities to reach significance (>1 replay sequence per second, with \"replay\" defined as a sequence of reactivations within a certain time lag). Furthermore, when scaling the number of replay events with a behavioural measure we were unable to experimentally induce a strong correlation between sequenceness and this measure. We infer that even if replay was present at plausible rates in our resting state dataset we would lack statistical power to detect it with TDLM. We discuss ways for optimizing the analysis approach and how to find boundary conditions under which TDLM can be expected to detect replay successfully. We conclude that solving these methodological constraints is likely to be crucial to optimise measuring replay non-invasively using MEG in humans.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

While both disease processes share progressive, decades-long deposition of fibrillar AB peptide, they differ in isoform composition. We hypothesized that post-translational modifications (PTMs) on AB would also differ between CAA and parenchymal plaques. Using Lys-N enzymatic digestion followed by quantitative mass spectrometry, we profiled AB isoforms and N-terminus PTMs (aspartic acid isomerization and pyroglutamate formation) across CAA severity and compared them to parenchymal plaque AB in AD. Moderate to severe CAA primarily featured intact N-terminus (AB1-x) (~95%) with minimal N-truncated species (AB2-x, AB3pGlu-x, AB4-x), whereas parenchymal plaques displayed diverse N-terminus truncations and PTMs. Increasing CAA severity correlated with a shift from longer, hydrophobic C-terminal isoforms (AB41, AB42, AB43) to shorter, less hydrophobic C-terminal isoforms (AB37, AB38, AB39, AB40). Importantly, moderate and severe CAA displayed minimal isomerization of Asp-1 and Asp-7 residues, which correlated significantly (r > 0.9) with shorter C-terminal isoforms (AB37, AB38, AB39, AB40). These patterns suggest distinct AB aggregation mechanisms in CAA versus parenchymal plaques. We propose that the intact N-terminus found in CAA with limited Asp isomerization is due to its inclusion within the protofibril structure (less disordered and inaccessible to PTMs), unlike the parenchymal plaques, where the N-terminus is more disordered and accessible to PTMs. These biochemical differences may reflect distinct protofibril architectures with potential implications for biomarker development for early CAA detection and therapeutic targeting of vascular and parenchymal AB.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

We operationalized word semantic representations with this set of specific dimensions, using computational models (53 languages' word embedding data; Study 1), human behavioral ratings (253 subjects, 8 languages; Study 2), and brain activity data (86 subjects, 45 languages; Study 3), and analyzed the similarity and variation patterns of concepts across different languages. These three approaches converge on the finding that, across diverse language samples, word semantic representations along the neurocognitive dimensional structures exhibit strong commonalities, with variations along this structure being significantly and uniquely explained by climate, beyond sociocultural-centered variables.

Here, we evaluated the effects of a maternal high-fat diet (HFD) during lactation on the development of tauopathy in the THY-Tau22 mouse strain, a model of progressive tau pathology associated with cognitive decline. During lactation, dams were fed either a chow diet (13.6% of fat) or a HFD (58% of fat). At weaning, offspring was fed a chow diet until sacrifice at 4 months of age (the onset of tau pathology) or 7 months of age (the onset of cognitive impairment). During lactation, maternal HFD increased body weight gain in offspring. At 3 months of age, maternal HFD led to a mild glucose intolerance only in male offspring. Moreover, it impaired spatial memory in both male and female 6-month-old offspring, with males being more impacted. These cognitive deficits were associated with increased phosphorylation of hippocampal tau protein-observed at 4 months in males and at 7 months in females, highlighting a sex-specific temporal shift. Additionally, maternal HFD modified adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), leading to an increase of mature neuronal cells number in females and of dendritic arborization length in males. Synaptic analysis further revealed that maternal HFD led to synaptic loss only in males. Finally, multi-omics approaches showed that maternal HFD has long-term consequences on both transcriptome, proteome and regulome, this effect being also sex-dependent with mitochondrial pathways, ribosomal activity, cilium and the extracellular matrix predominantly impacted in males, while gliogenesis, myelination and synaptic plasticity were primarily affected in females. Regulome analysis suggested that this sex-dependent phenotype was more related to a temporal shift rather than distinct sex-specific alterations. Collectively, our data suggest that maternal malnutrition accelerates the development of tauopathy in THY-Tau22 offspring, with sex-dependent effects, males being impacted earlier than females.

Ischemic stroke was induced in young (2-month-old) and old (15-18-month-old) mice. Memory functions were analyzed by the Y-maze test weekly for 8 weeks and the novel object recognition (NOR) test at 7 days before and 8 weeks post-stroke. We have also created a tibia fracture 6 hours before stroke injury in young mice, to test if the activation of 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchRs) reduces inflammatory cells and synapse elimination. Brains were collected 8 weeks after the induction of ischemic stroke. Transcriptome changes, neuronal injuries, neuroinflammation, synapse removal, and neurite outgrowth were analyzed. We found that old mice developed long-term memory dysfunction after ischemic stroke, which was not seen in young mice. Old mice showed larger infarct volume, higher neuroinflammation, and more synapses engulfed by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the peri-atrophic region and hippocampi than young mice. More synapse-engulfing astrocytes than microglia/macrophages were present in the peri-atrophic region and the ipsilateral hippocampi, suggesting that reactive astrocytes contributed more than activated microglia/macrophages in synapse removal. Activation of 7-nAchRs in mice subjected to tibia fracture 6 hours before ischemic injury reduced synapse removal by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the hippocampi. Our study indicated that an increase in synaptic elements by inflammatory cells contributes to the long-lasting memory deficit after stroke in old mice.

P.; Danet, L.; Pariente, J.; Albucher, J.-f.; Peran, P.; Barbeau, E. J.", "abstract": "The thalamus, traditionally viewed as a sensory relay station, is now recognized for its critical role in higher-order cognitive functions, including memory. While most research has focused on its distinct nuclei, the thalamus also contains crucial white matter tracts, such as the mammillothalamic tract (MTT), part of the Papez circuit. Despite its established role in memory, the MTT remains underappreciated in studies on the cognitive role of the thalamus, increasing the risk of misattributing memory functions to nearby thalamic nuclei. This study investigates the memory impact of thalamic strokes by considering disruption to the MTT. We examined 40 patients with chronic ischemic thalamic lesions and 45 healthy controls using neuropsychological assessments, focusing on the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and high-resolution structural neuroimaging. Advanced imaging techniques, such as symptom mapping and disconnectome analyses, were employed to analyze the relationships between lesion sites, tract disconnections and cognitive outcomes. Additionally, the expression of calbindin-rich matrix cells and parvalbumin-rich core cells was examined to assess how the connectivity property of thalamic cells, and its disruption, can relate to cognitive deficits following a thalamic stroke. Patients with left-sided thalamic lesions, especially those involving the MTT, showed significant memory impairments. Symptom mapping identified a specific cluster of lesioned voxels in the left anterior-lateral thalamus, including the MTT, as being strongly associated with poorer memory performance. Disconnectome analysis confirmed that verbal memory deficits were associated with disruption of the MTT. Furthermore, a striking overlap was observed between the critical regions linked to memory deficits and calbindin-rich thalamic areas. However, this calbindin-rich region was also disrupted in patients without memory impairment, revealing that MTT disruption, and not lesions to this region, induced memory deficits in these patients. The identified FCSRT deficit cluster overlapped with brain regions consistently linked to memory processes following fMRI meta-analytic mapping of memory-related keywords. These findings challenge the traditional focus on thalamic nuclei and connector hubs, indicating a need to reappraise the importance of the MTT in memory impairment after a thalamic stroke. This study advocates for a shift in thalamic research, emphasizing the need to investigate tract-specific contributions and disruptions of the MTT but also of other tracts such as the interthalamic adhesion or amygdalo-fugal pathway, rather than holding only to a \"nuclei-centric\" view of the thalamus.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

The hippocampus, essential for learning and memory, is particularly vulnerable to metabolic stress and inflammation. Canagliflozin (Cana), an FDA-approved sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) for type 2 diabetes, extends lifespan in male but not female mice, but its impact on brain aging is unknown. Here, we used a multi-omics strategy integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to investigate how chronic Cana treatment reprograms brain aging in genetically diverse UM-HET3 mice. In males, Cana induced mitochondrial function, insulin and cGMP-PKG signaling, and suppressed neuroinflammatory networks across all molecular layers, resulting in improved hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. In females, transcriptional activation of neuroprotective pathways did not translate to protein or metabolite-level changes and failed to rescue cognition. In the 5xFAD AD model, Cana reduced amyloid plaque burden, microgliosis, and memory deficits in males only, despite comparable peripheral glucose improvements in both sexes. Our study reveals sex-specific remodeling of hippocampal aging by a clinically available SGLT2i, with implications for AD pathology and lifespan extension, and highlights Cana's potential to combat brain aging and AD through sex-specific mechanisms.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Reactive astrocytes are regulated by cellular and molecular mechanisms that are known to progress A{beta} pathology. However, the metabolic adaptation and metabolites required to fuel these molecular changes in reactive astrocytes remain unknown. Using human AD samples, in vivo amyloid mouse models, and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that reactive astrocytes utilize glutamine to fuel anaplerosis and meet their metabolic demands, thereby progressing amyloidosis. We show that reactive astrocytes increase Na+-coupled neutral amino acid transporters for glutamine uptake that are interdependent on Na+/K+ ATPase. Furthermore, increasing brain-glutamine levels with a high-glutamine diet exacerbated reactive astrocytes, increasing A{beta} burden in an amyloid mouse model. We demonstrate that glutamine undergoes glutaminolysis via glutaminase-2/glutamate dehydrogenase-1 enzymes to be incorporated into TCA metabolites for anaplerosis. Pharmacologically or genetically blocking glutaminolysis reduces reactive astrocytes and decreases A{beta} pathology in an amyloid mouse. Our findings reveal the first glutamine-dependent metabolic adaptation of reactive astrocytes affecting A{beta} pathology, which may be harnessed for AD therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

According to a recent meta-analysis, pulsed taVNS induces larger pupil dilation (vs. sham), but sensory aspects of the stimulation may contribute to these differences. Moreover, included studies were often small and stimulation was only applied to the left ear, so that questions about the robustness and generalization remain. Here, we investigated the effects of pulsed taVNS (1s, 20Hz, 400s pulse width) at the right ear on phasic pupil dilation using a randomized crossover design in 94 participants (47 women). We initially calibrated the stimulation amplitude to match the perceived sensation across conditions and tracked sensation over time. Contrary to our hypothesis, taVNS did not elicit greater pupil dilation versus sham (b = -0.42, 95% CI [-1.30; 0.46], p = .35). However, taVNS effects were larger if sham was perceived as less intense despite the initial matching (b = 3.39, 95% CI [0.62; 6.17], p = .017). Differences in intensity ratings were mainly associated with sham-induced pupil dilation (r = -.25, 95% CI [-.43; -.05], p = .013). To summarize, our results recapitulate the findings of other studies using fixed amplitudes by showing that right-sided pulsed taVNS only induced larger pupil dilation against sham if differences in sensation arose. These findings highlight the challenge of establishing a suitable sham condition since both taVNS and sham affect sensory nerves, potentially leading to confounding effects.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Morphine was selected due to the high leverage capacity to address the opioid epidemic. A single treatment of LSD, or 4 microdoses of LSD, cause accelerated extinction of morphine-induced conditioned place preference. Whole-cell electrophysiology revealed that excitatory synaptic plasticity, which was eliminated in VTA GABA neurons following morphine exposure, was restored 24 hours after a single high dose of LSD. To explore the impact of LSD treatment on potential epigenetic changes, whole-brain DNA methylation analysis in morphine-treated mice that received either saline or LSD post-morphine treatment revealed significant differences in methylation profiles associated with LSD treatment.

While TLR5 signaling has previously been implicated in promoting myeloid cell recruitment to the ovarian TME, the upstream source of ligand and its systemic effects on hematopoiesis remain poorly understood(1,2). Here, we show that ovarian cancer disrupts gut barrier integrity, leading to systemic translocation of TLR5 ligands into the peritoneum, blood, and bone marrow. This translocation correlates with enhanced expansion of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow of wild-type (WT) but not TLR5-deficient (TLR5 KO) mice, leading to enhanced accumulation of monocytes into the tumor microenvironment. Pharmacologic blockade of TLR5 in tumor-bearing mice alters the composition of tumor-associated myeloid populations, increasing the frequency of monocytes and CCR2-expressing macrophages In the bone marrow of tumor-bearing WT mice. In the bone marrow, blockade of TLR5 signaling led to expansion of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), a phenotype recapitulated in a competitive chimera model. In vitro, stimulation of WT bone marrow cells with purified TLR5 ligands led to enhanced colony formation and skewed differentiation toward granulocyte-macrophage lineages. These data reveal that chronic TLR5 signaling, driven by tumor-induced gut leakage, promotes expansion of myeloid cells within the bone marrow and is a host-intrinsic mechanism driving accumulation of immature monocytes and macrophages into the tumor microenvironment.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Ocean is thought to be one of the ultimate environments where ARGs gathered. Marine ecosystems represent vast reservoirs of ARGs, yet their dynamics in open-ocean environments remain poorly characterized.

The ARG abundance at this site exceeded coastal levels by 90-fold. Notably, multidrug resistance genes dominated this hotspot, with efflux pumps contributing 62% of the resistance mechanisms, a pattern distinct from the target-alteration strategies prevalent in other regions. The site exhibited unique microbial consortia, including pathogenic Acinetobacter (30.2% abundance) carrying clinically critical determinants (blaOXA-23, adeJ).

However, the impact of blocking ActRIIA/IIB on strength, metabolic regulation and insulin action remains unclear. Methods Here, we investigated the effect of short- (10 mg/kg once, 40h) or long-term (10 mg/kg twice weekly, 21 days) antibody targeting ActRIIA/IIB (ActRIIA/IIBab) in lean and diet-induced obese mice and engineered human muscle tissue. Results Short-term ActRIIA/IIB administration in lean mice increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by 76-105%. Despite this, ActRIIA/IIB-treated mice exhibited 33% elevated fasting blood glucose and glucose intolerance. Moreover, long-term ActRIIA/IIB treatment increased average muscle mass (20%) and reduced fat mass (-8%) in obese mice but did not change insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue, yet induced marked glucose intolerance, and increased hepatic glucose output in response to pyruvate. Concomitantly, long-term ActRIIA/IIBab treatment increased strength (30%) in mouse soleus muscle and prevented activin A-induced loss of tissue strength in engineered human muscle tissue. Surprisingly, long-term ActRIIA/IIBab treatment lowered volitional running (-250%). Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that, in accordance with human studies, ActRIIA/IIB blockade holds promise for increasing muscle mass, strength, and insulin sensitivity. However, contrary to the improved glycemic control in humans, ActRIIA/IIB blockade in mice causes severe glucose intolerance and lowers voluntary physical activity.

However, the molecular organization and pathogenic mechanisms of mammalian ERAD have remained elusive. Here, we report the first cryo-EM structure of the core mammalian ERAD complex, comprising the ER lectin OS9, SEL1L, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1. The structure, validated by mutagenesis and crosslinking assays, reveals a dimeric assembly of the core complex in which SEL1L and OS9 form a claw-like configuration in the ER lumen that mediates substrate engagement, while HRD1 dimerizes within the membrane to facilitate substrate translocation. Pathogenic SEL1L mutations at the SEL1L-OS9 (Gly585Asp) and SEL1L-HRD1 (Ser658Pro) interfaces disrupt complex formation and impair ERAD activity. A newly identified disease-associated HRD1 variant (Ala91Asp), located in transmembrane helix 3, impairs HRD1 dimerization and substrate processing, underscoring the functional necessity of this interface and HRD1 dimerization.

However, accumulating evidence shows that some GPCRs activate G proteins from intracellular organelles, such as endosomes. Importantly, endosomal rather than plasma membrane G protein signaling has been associated with transcriptional activity. Here, we demonstrate that the endosomal US28 population robustly activates Gq/11, and thus, provides the major contribution of Gq/11 signaling.

We analyzed how the abundance and spatial arrangement of Pheidole bergi colonies varied according to habitat heterogeneity at two spatial scales and long-term environmental changes in the central Monte desert. Densities of active P. bergi colonies were similar in permanent grids within a protected algarrobal (open woodland) and on disturbed dirt roads crossing that habitat but showed a >50% reduction in the 2001-2025 period. There were also significant variations in colony density along some dirt roads, and they were 40-50% lower on those crossing other habitats (sand dunes and livestock-grazed algarrobal). Colonies within the algarrobal were not arranged randomly. The best-fitted of several spatial point process models proposed maximum probability of active colonies at the inter-patch borders of vegetation, decreasing 56% faster into the vegetated patches than towards the open patches. Further distance-related pairwise interactions between colonies were slightly positive in 2001, resulting in clumped distributions, and became strongly negative by 2019, when densities were less than a half, favoring more random and overdispersed spatial patterns. Pheidole bergi, a highly abundant and potentially ecologically significant ant species in the central Monte desert, seems flexible enough to establish colonies in different habitats and microhabitats although with distribution and population dynamics still shaped by environmental conditions such as soil texture, vegetation cover or resource availability. The strong decline in colony density along the years and associated changes in spatial distribution suggest that both direct and indirect effects of environmental variability, including prolonged drought, play a key role in the establishment and survival of its colonies. Furthermore, the shifting relevance of inter-colony interactions or density-dependent competition highlights the complex interplay between environmental constraints and intraspecific dynamics in the population ecology of P. bergi.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Despite a rising global incidence, the underlying causes and optimal management strategies for pediatric IBD are still not fully understood. Compared to adult IBD, pediatric IBD frequently presents with distinct disease phenotypes, and is more commonly linked to rare monogenic variants that cause intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction or affect the function of mucosal immune cells. While more than 100 genes have been associated with early-onset IBD, the roles of many of these genes in the intestinal epithelium and the mechanisms by which genetic variants contribute to disease remain poorly defined. Here we aimed to improve our understanding of intestinal epithelium dysfunction in early-onset IBD by conducting extensive molecular and cellular characterization to gain insights into patient-specific epithelial phenotypes and identify therapeutic targets. We generated intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs) from 94 pediatric IBD patients, representing diverse clinical characteristics and including those with monogenic variants (BTK n=4, TTC7A n=3, IL10RA n=1, LRBA n=1, STXBP2 n=1, TTC37 n=1, TRNT1 n=1, PLCG2 n=1, DKC1 n=1, POLA1 n=1), and 46 non-IBD controls. This effort resulted in the largest RNA-seq dataset of pediatric IBD intestinal epithelial organoids to date, encompassing both baseline conditions and post-immunological stimulation, serving as a valuable resource for future research. We observed that IEOs effectively initiate inflammation upon stimulation with bacterial lysate, regardless of disease status, origin, or mutation status. Inflammatory stimulation triggered single-gene upregulation of IBD-linked SERPINA1 and LIFR across the IBD population compared to controls, suggesting their role in intestinal epithelial innate immune responses. However, co-expression network analysis showed no consistent transcriptional signatures across the entire IBD group at the systems level. Instead, differences emerged between controls and specific genotypes (TTC7A, STXBP2, LRBA), with STXBP2 and LRBA sharing an upregulated transcriptional response of IL-1 and SLC30-mediated zinc trafficking pathways.

By comparing the dentin exposure ratio (DER) with a newly developed quadrant-based modification of Scott's dental wear scoring system (Krueger-Scott method), we evaluate how wear patterns vary by age, sex, and occlusal region. Materials and Methods: Mandibular second molars (M2) were assessed at two timepoints, during life and postmortem, in 201 captive baboons from the Southwest National Primate Research Center. Krueger-Scott and DER data were collected from 3D intraoral scans processed in MEDIT Link software. The Krueger-Scott scores assigned ordinal scores (1-10) to four equal quadrants of each M2 based on enamel facet development and dentin exposure. Statistical analyses tested relationships between wear progression, quadrant location, sex, and age. Results: Krueger-Scott scores and DER values increased significantly between timepoints, indicating wear progression. However, Krueger-Scott scores revealed strong functional patterning: buccal and lingual cusps showed high within-group correlations and weaker cross-group correlations. Males showed significantly higher wear than females, despite being younger on average. The relationship between age and wear progression differed by sex. Discussion: The Krueger-Scott method provided a more anatomically informative and efficient approach to tracking occlusal wear than DER. It captured regional wear variation and functional asymmetries that DER could not detect. Even under controlled conditions, sex-based differences in wear emerged, likely reflecting behavioral, morphological, or enamel structural variation.

Meiotic HORMADs possess a central chromatin binding region (CBR) whose architecture varies across eukaryotic groups. Here, we determine high-resolution crystal structures of the meiotic HORMAD CBR from two diverged aquatic holozoa, Schistosoma mansoni and Patiria miniata, which reveal tightly-associated PHD and winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domains. We show that PHD-wHTH CBRs bind duplex DNA through their wHTH domains, and identify key residues that disrupt this interaction. Combining experimental and predicted structures, we show that the CBRs' PHD domains likely interact with the tail of histone H3, and may discriminate between unmethylated and trimethylated H3 lysine 4. Finally, we show that holozoa Hop1 CBRs bind nucleosomes in vitro in a bipartite manner involving both the PHD and wHTH domains. Our data reveal how meiotic HORMADs with PHD-wHTH CBRs can bind chromatin and potentially discriminate between chromatin states to drive meiotic recombination to specific chromosomal regions.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

J.; Monaghan, J. R.; Shefelbine, S. J.", "abstract": "Background: Axolotls can regenerate entire limbs, recapitulating mammalian developmental processes. During development, mechanosensitive ion channels such as TRPV4, PIEZO1, and PIEZO2 regulate tissue morphogenesis by transducing mechanical signals. Their roles in regeneration, however, have yet to be thoroughly explored. To investigate this, we assessed the expression of these channels during limb regeneration using single cell RNA sequencing dataset, hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence. Additionally, functional relevance was tested by pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 and PIEZO1/2 mechanosensitive ion channels during limb regeneration. Results: While PIEZO1 expression was undetected, we observed TRPV4 and PIEZO2 expression in uninjured cartilage and at both the mid-bud and palette blastemal stages of limb regeneration. TRPV4 and PIEZO2 were highly expressed in chondrocytes, with PIEZO2 enriched in fibroblasts. Inhibition with GSK205, a TRPV4 antagonist, significantly reduced calcium influx and humeral length without inhibiting cartilage differentiation. Treatment with gadolinium chloride, a broad spectrum mechanosensitive ion channel inhibitor, had no significant morphological impact. Conclusions: TRPV4 and PIEZO2 are dynamically regulated during axolotl limb regeneration. Selective TRPV4 inhibition altered final limb morphology, but chondrogenesis was unaffected. This suggests a role for these genes in shaping tissue architecture during limb regeneration. These findings underscore the importance of ion channel mediated mechanotransduction in regenerative patterning.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

Tardigrades are a paradigm for this resilience, entering a state of suspended animation called cryptobiosis to withstand near-complete desiccation and intense radiation. While a few key effectors, including the DNA-shielding protein Dsup and various tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) have been identified, they constitute only a fraction of a vast, uncharacterized proteome, fundamentally limiting a systems-level understanding of this remarkable biology. Here we overcome this limitation by developing AEGIS, an AI-driven engine that systematically discovers and prioritizes novel 'guardian' proteins constituting the tardigrade molecular shield. Applying AEGIS to the tardigrade proteome, we construct the first functional atlas of the tardigrade 'resistome', revealing hundreds of novel protein families organized into a diverse and compartmentalized molecular toolkit. This atlas pinpoints new Dsup-like nuclear proteins, suggesting multi-layered genome protection, and a rich cohort of cytoplasmic proteins poised to form protective biological glasses.

However, most of these models are somewhat limited in their ability to capture cell-to-cell spatial relationships essential for understanding tissue microenvironments. To address this issue, self-supervised learning (SSL) applied to cellular graph models is a promising avenue of investigation as this would afford one the ability to capture cell-level interpretability of the tissue microenvironment and learn relationships from the cellular topology. Compared to SSL on tissue patches, developing cellular graph models requires considerable computation and algorithmic effort, starting with accurate cell detection/segmentation from tissue and then subsequently requiring adequate cell-level feature extraction. In this study, we demonstrate that a pretrained tissue patch encoder, originally trained in the context of the token used in conventional vision transformer frameworks can also serve effectively as a cellular graph encoder for cell-based patches. We report three key findings: 1) the pretrained tissue patch encoder acts as a powerful graph-level feature extractor for cellular graphs in tissue patches; 2) it also can function as a cell-level feature extractor, allowing each cell to be contextualized within its local tissue microenvironment environment; 3) the cell patch size and positional embeddings are critical factors for high-quality cellular graph feature extraction. To validate and support these insights, we evaluate our approach on various tissue region classification tasks from three different types of cancers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art foundation models in computational pathology. These results highlight the potential of pretrained tissue patch encoders in cellular graph modeling, which can enable insights into how the cellular features and topology are related to various biological processes and phenomena.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

It appears as a strong correlation of the variations {Delta}{Delta}H and {Delta}{Delta}S of enthalpy and entropy resulting from experiments performed either at different temperatures on a given system (e.g. the binding of a ligand on a macromolecule), or at the same temperature T on related systems (e.g. the binding of related ligands on a macromolecule). In both cases, EEC is characterized by the \"compensation temperatures\" ({Delta}{Delta}H/{Delta}{Delta}S). When a continuous variable X (e.g. X = pH) characterizes the related systems at constant temperature, {Theta}T =({partial}{Delta}H/{partial}{Delta}S)T  may be used in lieu of the ratio of finite variations and when T is variable and X constant, one may always consider {Theta}X  =({partial}{Delta}H/{partial}{Delta}S)X . Thermodynamics trivially imposes {Theta}X  {equiv} T, but also {Theta}T  = T +{delta}T(X,T), where the corrective term {delta}T(X,T) only depends on {Delta}G(X,T). The quest for \"molecular\" explanations of EEC is thus vain: only the value of {Theta}T  deserves such explanations. This is illustrated with the denaturation of globular proteins and with the dissociation of hydrophobic peptides from a specific protein. The theoretical estimate {Theta}T  = (T -T*)/Ln(T/T*) with T* [~=] 383K being imposed by experiments, fits well experimental results. Considerations of molecular dynamics (MD) methods led to a theoretical estimate for {Theta}T when no continuous variable X exists.

We aimed to investigate whether MASH impairs endothelial function via nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanisms and to identify potential liver-derived mediators involved in this process. Endothelial function was assessed in two murine MASH models, Foz mice fed a high-fat diet and C57BL/6JRj mice fed a western diet with fructose, by using wire myography, while blood pressure was monitored via telemetry. NO pathway was further investigated through eNOS expression and activation and Hb-NO measurements. ADMA metabolism was analyzed in both liver tissue and plasma by LC-MS and gene expressions. Additionally, bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were treated with mouse plasma to measure the circulating factors effects on eNOS activation and the role of oxidative stress. Both models exhibited impaired NO-dependent vasorelaxation without evidence of atherosclerosis. In Foz mice, this impairment was associated with reduced eNOS expression and activation. Surprisingly, plasma Hb-NO levels did not reflect vascular NO deficiency, likely due to elevated hepatic iNOS expression. In both models, hepatic and plasma ADMA levels were increased, concomitant with hepatic upregulation of Prmt1. BAECs exposed to plasma from MASH mice showed reduced eNOS activation independent of oxidative stress. Our findings reveal that MASH is consistently associated with NO-dependent endothelial dysfunction, with ADMA emerging as a key liver-derived mediator. The PRMT1/ADMA/NO axis may represent a mechanistic link between liver pathology and vascular impairment, positioning ADMA as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for cardiovascular risk associated with MASH.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

However, large-scale investigations of peptides as potential disease biomarkers or drug candidates are still hindered by their challenging biochemical properties and the scarcity of specialized analytical tools.

Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great ability in profiling low-abundance ions. Nevertheless, most available DIA analytical tools are designed for proteomics studies and are not suitable for endogenous peptides, as there is no set enzymatic cleavage for these peptides. Here, we introduce the novel EndoGenius platform, paired with DIA-NN, to achieve high-confidence neuropeptide identification using an updated spectral library for DIA MS analysis. By employing orthogonal offline fractionation, ion mobility instrumentation, and an optimized database searching algorithm specifically for neuropeptides, we have constructed the largest crustacean neuropeptide spectral library to date. With this library, in combination with neural networking technology, we report a 100-fold increase in the number of neuropeptides identified in all Cancer borealis tissues analyzed.

Such movements are thought to be initiated by a subcortical fast visuomotor network, but it is unclear how this network declines with age. Past work in the upper limb has detailed delayed reaching corrections to jumped visual stimuli in the elderly, but the underlying mechanisms contributing to these changes of the fast visuomotor network are poorly understood. Conversely, work in the lower limb has reported delayed muscle recruitment during obstacle avoidance, but such findings may be confounded by age-related challenges in postural control. The output of the fast visuomotor network can be quantified by measuring express visuomotor responses (EVRs), which are the earliest and very short-latency bursts of muscle activity that follow visual target presentation. Here, we compare the prevalence, latency, and magnitude of EVRs in elderly (58-80 years old) and younger (18-25 years old) participants performing visually-guided reaches. We also investigated the impact of postural stability by having participants reach either while seated on a stable chair, or on a wobble stool. Both the elderly and younger cohorts expressed EVRs, but EVRs in the elderly were comparatively less frequent, and had longer latencies and smaller magnitude. Postural instability had no effects on these outcomes. Our results suggest age-related declines in the fast visuomotor network, potentially resulting from deterioration of underlying circuits and a prioritization of stability over speed.

Understanding the sensory innervation of TMJ structures, particularly the retrodiscal tissue, is essential for identifying pain mechanisms in TMJD because to study these mechanisms, we must first determine the sensory neuronal makeup of the TMJ. However, data on nerve types within TMJ tissues remain limited. This study examined the sensory and sympathetic nerve profiles in retrodiscal tissues from TMJD patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or condylar hyperplasia (CH) who underwent bilateral TMJ replacement (TMJR). Immunohistochemistry with specific nerve markers was used to visualize and quantify nerve subtypes. CH tissues had significantly lower densities of pgp9.5+ sensory fibers compared to RA and OA, which showed similar levels. Across all subtypes, the ratio of unmyelinated (pgp9.5+/NFH-) to myelinated (pgp9.5+/NFH+) fibers was approximately 70:30. Most sensory nerves were CGRP+ (peptidergic), while a smaller portion were CGRP- (non-peptidergic), some of which were parvalbumin-positive (PV+). Both myelinated and non-myelinated peptidergic as well as non-peptidergic fibers were present in the retrodiscal tissues. In addition to sensory innervation, all retrodiscal tissues contained tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH+) sympathetic fibers, primarily innervating blood vessels (alpha-smooth muscle actin+). These vessels were also predominantly innervated by unmyelinated sensory fibers, with limited input from myelinated sensory nerves. In summary, all TMJD subtypes shared similar nerve compositions, but CH tissues exhibited reduced sensory nerve density, a potential explanation for the lower association with pain compared to OA and RA. For all TMJD subtypes, retrodiscal tissue vasculature was mainly innervated by sympathetic and unmyelinated sensory nerves.

This study introduces a deep learning approach for robust and automated 3D segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) images. Methods. We developed a multi-class 3D U-Net to segment fascicles and epineurium that incorporates a novel anatomy-aware loss function to ensure that predictions respect nerve topology. We trained and tested the network using subject-level five-fold cross-validation with 100 microCT sub-volumes (11.4 [&mu]m isotropic resolution) from cervical and thoracic vagus nerves stained with phosphotungstic acid from five subjects. We benchmarked the 3D U-Net's performance against a 2D U-Net using both standard and anatomy-specific segmentation metrics. Results. Our 3D U-Net generated high-quality segmentations (average Dice similarity coefficient: 0.93). Compared to the 2D U-Net, our 3D U-Net yielded significantly better volumetric overlap, boundary delineation, and fascicle-level accuracy. The 3D approach reduced anatomical errors by 2.5-fold, provided more consistent inter-slice boundaries, and improved detection of fascicle splits/merges by nearly 6-fold. Significance. Our automated 3D segmentation pipeline provides anatomically accurate 3D maps of peripheral neural morphology from microCT data.

In macrophages that play a critical role in host immunity, MST1/2 are proteolytically cleaved to coordinate different forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis and pyroptosis. This cleavage event occurs when the innate immune sensors, inflammasomes, are activated by the bacterial pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, or damage-associated molecular patterns. In this report, we determine MST1/2 cleavage in macrophages under various inflammatory conditions and challenges with pathogenic bacteria. The sterile molecules ATP and nigericin induce MST1/2 cleavage and apoptosis when the NLRP3 inflammasome and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis are activated. Remarkably, in conditions without NLRP3 or GSDMD activation, MST1/2 are still cleaved by caspases to promote cell death in macrophages treated with these sterile molecules. During infection, wildtype macrophages trigger MST1/2 cleavage and apoptosis against L. pneumophila and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis but preferentially activate GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. Interestingly, GSDMD knockout macrophages opt to cleave MST1/2 and undergo apoptosis in response to P. aeruginosa and S. enterica, suggesting an interplay between GSDMD and MST1/2.

Unlike previous methods, VAMPIRE enables reference-free, fine-grained decomposition of both simple and complex TRs, capturing motif variation in sequence, length, and structure with high sensitivity and scalability. Applied to complete telomere-to-telomere (T2T) human and nonhuman primate (NHP) genome assemblies, VAMPIRE reveals previously unrecognized high-order repeat inversions within human centromeres - an underappreciated evolutionary mechanism contributing to centromere diversity. Additionally, the tool identifies lineage-specific and expanded TRs, including human-specific STR/VNTR expansions and NHP-specific subtelomeric heterochromatin (e.g., pCht/StSat), underscoring their dynamic turnover and structural complexity. VAMPIRE provides a robust and scalable framework for TR analysis in the era of long-read sequencing, with broad utility across human genetics, evolutionary biology, and the study of complex TRs in non-model organisms.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

I.; Pandey, V.; Verma, A.; Young, T.; Williams, J. C.; Barroso, M.; Intes, X.", "abstract": "Significance Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (MFLI) is a powerful, noninvasive imaging modality that offers robust, physiologically relevant contrast largely independent of fluorophore concentration, excitation intensity, and tissue signal attenuation. However, accurately determining the depth of signal origin remains challenging, potentially leading to ambiguity in biological interpretation. Here, we present a novel optical correction method that effectively eliminates surface signal bias, such as that from skin in preclinical imaging, without the need for chemical clearance. This advancement supports the robust applicability of MFLI in translational research. Aim Establishment of a High Spatial Frequency Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (HSF FLI) framework to selectively isolate subsurface fluorescence (deeper signals) from surface fluorescence, while preserving the accuracy of lifetime estimation. Approach A modulation transfer function (MTF) that relates spatial frequency to penetration depth was derived using Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) simulations (for physics-based modeling) and validated with agar-based capillary phantoms on a time gated ICCD DMD system. Depth-independent fluorescence was decomposed into surface and subsurface components through structured three-phase sinusoidal illumination, and nonlinear least squares fitting was applied to recover lifetime or lifetime based parameters maps. HSF FLI was demonstrated in vivo in mouse models bearing tumor xenogratfs and was cross validated with ex vivo measurements. Results We extensively characterized the performance of High Spatial Frequency Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (HSF FLI) through simulations and tissue-mimicking phantoms. The approach was further validated in vivo by assessing drug delivery in preclinical models using MFLI-FRET (Forster Resonance Energy Transfer). Conclusion By coupling structured illumination with physics-based depth modeling, HSF FLI delivers accurate, depth-selective lifetime readouts, setting the stage for robust and fast FLI implementation in translational studies.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Fetal sex is associated with the maternal gut microbiota composition and its metabolic function", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.15.659758", "authors": "Williams, B. M.; Liu, J.; Bernabe, B. P.", "abstract": "Background: Pregnancy affects almost every organ and system, including the microorganisms that resides in the gastrointestinal track, the gut microbiota. Pregnancy hormones, such as progesterone and estradiol, alter the composition of the maternal gut microbiota, directly and indirectly, and in turn, the gastrointestinal microorganism can modify the activity of reproductive hormones. While the levels of pregnancy hormones depend on the fetal sex, the role of fetal sex in the maternal gut microbiota composition and function has not been explored yet. Methods: Using publicly available microbial sequencing data from a cohort of 485 pregnant women in Guangzhou, China, we identified taxonomical and predicted metabolic signatures associated with fetal sex and gestational age using zero-inflated Gaussian models and linear models, respectively, correcting for pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal age, parity, and residency status. Further, we determined sex-specific co-abundance microbial networks using SPIEC-EASI. Results: We observed higher diversity levels in male than in female pregnancies and identified multiple microbial species and predicted microbial enzymes that were differentially abundant between the fetal sex groups, such as increased levels of Tyzerrella and {beta}-glucuronidase in female pregnancies, respectively. {beta}-glucuronidase deconjugates glucuronide-bound estrogens into free estrogens and glucuronic acid. Further, the microbial co-abundance networks between the male and female pregnancies were distinct, with efficient information transfer being representative of the female network while the male network was characterized by a larger number of competitive or exclusion interactions between microbial species. While the two networks had similar core communities, there were distinct connections between hormone metabolizing microbes, with {beta}-glucuronidase expressing microbes being more highly connected in the female network. Conclusions: Our study suggests that differences in the maternal-fetal interactions, such as fetus/placenta-produced hormone levels, may affect and be affected by the composition of the gut microbiota of pregnant individuals in a sex-specific manner. A better understanding of the relationship between fetal sex and the maternal gut microbiota may improve maternal health and fetal outcomes.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}

{"title": "Multi-Scale Parcellation of Dynamic Causal Models of the Brain", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.14.659698", "authors": "Zarghami, T. S.", "abstract": "The hierarchical organization of the brain's distributed network has received growing interest from the neuroscientific community, largely because of its potential to enhance our understanding of the human cognition and behavior, in health and disease. While most multiscale connectivity analyses focus on structural and functional networks, characterizing the effective connectome across multiple scales has been somewhat overlooked - mostly for computational reasons. The difficulty of estimating large cyclic causal models on the one hand, and the scarcity of theoretical frameworks for systematically moving between scales on the other hand, have hindered progress in this direction. This technical note introduces a top-down multi-scale parcellation scheme for dynamic causal models, with application to neuroimaging data. The method is based on Bayesian model comparison, as a generalization to the well-known delta-BIC method. To facilitate the computations, recent developments in linear dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and Bayesian model reduction (BMR) are deployed. Specifically, a naive version of BMR is introduced, using which the parcellation scheme can be scaled up to hundreds or thousands of regions. Notably, the derivations reveal an analytical relationship between the model comparison score and the concept of cut size in graph theory. This duality puts the tools of graph theory at the service of model evidence optimization and significance testing. The proposed method was applied to simulated and empirical causal models, for face and construct validity. Notably, the large causal network (inferred from a neuroimaging dataset) showed scale-invariance in multiple measures. Future generalizations of this technique and its potential applications in systems and clinical neuroscience have been discussed.", "date": "2025-06-15", "journal": ""}
