However, the relative contributions of genotype, environment, and prior developmental transitions to variance in the phenology of wild plants is largely unknown. Individual components of phenology (e.g., germination) might be loosely related with the timing of maturation due to variation in prior developmental transitions. Given widespread evidence that genetic variation in life history is adaptive, we investigated to what degree experimentally measured genetic variation in Arabidopsis phenology predicts phenology of plants in the wild. As a proxy of phenology, we obtained collection dates from nature of 227 naturally inbred Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from across Eurasia. We compared this phenology in nature with experimental data on the descendant inbred lines that we synthesized from two new and 155 published controlled experiments. We tested whether the genetic variation in flowering and germination timing from experiments predicted the phenology of the same lines in nature. We found that genetic variation in phenology from controlled experiments significantly predicts day of collection from wild individuals, as a proxy for date of flowering, across Eurasia. However, local variation in collection dates within a region was not explained by genetic variance in phenology in experiments, suggesting high plasticity across small-scale environmental gradients or complex interactions between the timing of different developmental transitions. While experiments have shown phenology is under selection, understanding the subtle environmental and stochastic effects on phenology may help to clarify the heritability and evolution of phenological traits in nature.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanism of how cell competition confers the loser cells with the metastatic potential of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to transit between dissemination and colonization remains elusive. Here we found cell competition gives rise to less fit but viable cells that transformed into CTCs via adherent-to-suspension transition (AST) mechanisms. The induction of hematopoietic transcription factors hijacked by solid tumor cells rendered CTCs competent to reprogram their anchorage dependency and disseminate into the bloodstream, while subsequent suppression of these factors was critical to regain adhesion and colonize metastatic lesions. Disrupting the oscillatory dynamics of AST factors blocked the adherent-suspension plasticity (ASP) of breast cancer CTCs and suppressed lung metastasis. Furthermore, multiregional single-cell transcriptomic analyses of matched primary tumors, CTCs, and metastatic lesions from de novo metastatic breast cancer patients demonstrate the critical role of ASP in metastasis. Significance: We demonstrate that cell competition-mediated displacement of CTCs manifests dynamic oscillation of AST factors that confer anchorage plasticity of solid tumor cells critical for the dissemination and colonization of CTCs. These findings highlight the potential of targeting AST factors to develop effective anti-metastatic therapies.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, in mice leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses.

By design, standard VCFs do not include data from sites where all individuals are homozygous for the reference allele (\"invariant sites\") and thus do not differentiate these from sites where data are completely missing. However, missing data are a key feature of biological datasets across all domains of genomics, and many recent studies have shown that missing data can introduce a variety of statistical biases in the estimation of key population genetic parameters. A solution to this limitation is to include invariant sites in a standard VCF, creating an \"all-sites VCF\", exposing missing and invariant sites explicitly. One hurdle to the wider adoption of all-sites VCFs is a reliable parameterized simulation framework for generating biologically realistic all-sites VCFs. Here, we introduce an open-source command line tool, vcfsim, that interfaces with the popular coalescent simulation platform msprime and provides convenience functions for simulating all-sites VCFs with variable levels of ploidy and missing data. We show that the post-processed VCFs generated using vcfsim align precisely with population genetic expectations (i.e. are statistically identical to raw msprime output) and can accurately introduce missing data and varying ploidy levels, including the simulation of intraindividual ploidy variation (e.g. heterogametic sex chromosomes). We suggest vcfsim will be a useful tool for the benchmarking of new software tools, training of machine learning models, and the exploration of the effects of missing data in genomics data sets.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

While several foundation models have been developed for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, there is still a lack of models specifically tailored for single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), which measures epigenetic information in individual cells. The principal challenge in developing such a model lies in the vast number of scATAC peaks and the significant sparsity of the data, which complicates the formulation of peak-to-peak correlations. To address this challenge, we introduce EpiFoundation, a foundation model for learning cell representations from the high-dimensional and sparse space of peaks. EpiFoundation relies on an innovative cross-modality pre-training procedure with two key technical innovations. First, EpiFoundation exclusively processes the non-zero peak set, thereby enhancing the density of cell-specific information within the input data. Second, EpiFoundation utilizes dense gene expression information to supervise the pre-training process, aligning peak-to-gene correlations. EpiFoundation can handle various types of downstream tasks, including cell-type annotation, batch correction, and gene expression prediction. To train and validate EpiFoundation, we curated MiniAtlas, a dataset of 100,000+ single cells with paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, along with diverse test sets spanning various tissues and cell types for robust evaluation.

While the role of transcription factors (TFs) and pioneer factors (PFs) in shaping chromatin accessibility is well established, the mechanisms coordinating spatiotemporal gene expression before gastrulation remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how a coordinated network of early-acting regulators, including the pioneer factors Zelda (Zld), GAGA factor (GAF), and the pioneer-like timing factor Odd-paired (Opa/ZIC3), along with Dorsal (Dl), Twist (Twi), the Polycomb subunit Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)), and the co-activator CBP, govern early transcriptional events in the Drosophila embryo. Using integrated chromatin accessibility, histone modification, TF binding, and transcriptomic data (bulk and single-cell), we identify two distinct classes of regulatory elements that govern early gene expression. The first class includes distal, PF-dependent enhancers that are inaccessible early and require PFs such as Opa and Zld to overcome Su(H) activities and H3K27me3-mediated repression and initiate transcription. The second class, enriched for PcG domains, comprises proximal enhancers that are accessible from the earliest nuclear cycles, despite being marked by H3K27me3 and bound by E(z). These regions are preloaded with RNA Polymerase II and positioned near promoters, suggesting a regulatory state primed for activation. While bound by multiple early TFs, these enhancers maintain accessibility independently of PF activity, functioning instead as autoregulatory elements that rely on PFs for maintenance rather than initiation. This study expands our understanding of how early TFs and PFs coordinate to balance transcriptional precision and developmental plasticity across germ layers, and redefines the role of PFs as both activators and stabilizers of gene regulatory architecture. Within this framework, Opa regulates key mesodermal and neuroectodermal genes such as slp1 and odd, and its activity is modulated by Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)). At earlier stages, Su(H) represses Opa target genes, but rising Opa levels at later timepoints override this repression, enabling activation. Together, these findings support a dual-mode enhancer logic: one mode driven by PF-mediated chromatin opening at distal, repressed enhancers, and another where proximal, pre-accessible enhancers within PcG-marked regions are reinforced by PF binding. This study redefines the role of PFs in early development, emphasizing their maintenance and stabilizing roles at poised enhancers, and provides a framework for how embryos balance transcriptional plasticity with spatial precision across all germ layers.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

However, limited knowledge of the diverse molecular and cellular functions carried out by ICs presents a major bottleneck in developing selective chemical probes for modulating their functions in disease states. The wealth of sequence data available on ICs from diverse organisms provides a valuable source of untapped information for illuminating the unique modes of channel regulation and functional specialization. However, the extensive diversification of IC sequences and the lack of a unified resource present a challenge in effectively using existing data for IC research. Here, we perform integrative mining of available sequence, structure, and functional data on 419 human ICs across disparate sources, including extensive literature mining by leveraging advances in large language models to annotate and curate the full complement of the channelome. We employ a well-established orthology inference approach to identify and extend the IC orthologs across diverse organisms to above 48,000. We show that the depth of conservation and taxonomic representation of IC sequences can further be translated to functional similarities by clustering them into functionally relevant groups, which can be used for downstream functional prediction on understudied members. We demonstrate this by delineating co-conserved patterns characteristic of the understudied family of the Calcium Homeostasis Modulator (CALHM) family of ICs. Through mutational analysis of co-conserved residues altered in human diseases and electrophysiological studies, we show that these evolutionarily-constrained residues play an important role in channel gating functions. Thus, by providing new tools and resources for performing large comparative analyses on ICs, this study addresses the unique needs of the IC community and provides the groundwork for accelerating the functional characterization of dark channels for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Aberrant splicing caused by mutations can lead to severe diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders, underscoring the need for accurate computational tools to predict splice sites and detect disruptions. Existing methods have made significant advances in splice site prediction but are often limited in handling long-range dependencies due to high computational costs, a factor critical to splicing regulation. Moreover, many models lack interpretability, hindering efforts to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. Here, we present SpliceSelectNet (SSNet), a novel deep-learning model that predicts splice sites directly from DNA sequences. This model is capable of handling long-range dependencies (up to 100 kb) using a hierarchical Transformer-based architecture with both local and global attention mechanisms. SSNet offers interpretability at the single nucleotide level, making it particularly effective for identifying aberrant splicing caused by mutations. Our model surpasses the state-of-the-art (SoTA) in splice site prediction on the Gencode test dataset and demonstrates superior performance in aberrant splicing prediction on the BRCA dataset.

Despite this importance, the mechanisms of female mating control and what prevents additional matings remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we developed a dual-color fluorescent sperm system in invasive Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and quantified mating patterns, confirming that 86-96% of females mate only once. Using behavioral tracking of mating pairs, deep learning, and quantitative analysis at increasing resolution, we discovered that females actively control mating initiation through a previously undescribed behavior: genital tip elongation. This female response is triggered by rapidly evolving male genital structures, creating a precise lock-and-key mechanism that determines mating success. Comparative analysis revealed that Aedes albopictus, separated from Aedes aegypti by 35 million years of evolution, employs a similar female-controlled system. However, Aedes albopictus males uniquely bypass female control when attempting cross-species matings with Aedes aegypti females but not with conspecific females. This ''lock-picking'' ability, combined with the known sterility of cross-species matings, may explain how Aedes albopictus competitively displaces Aedes aegypti populations in overlapping territories. Our findings redefine mosquito reproduction as a female-controlled process and establish a quantitative framework for investigating the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms underlying mating control and species competition in these globally important disease vectors.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

However, a general understanding of how changes in temperature and pH may universally impact protein evolution is lacking. Moreover, while pH is locally regulated in the different microbial compartments (e.g. periplasm, cytoplasm), temperature is not. A priori, these variables should act at different rates over evolutionary timescales with respect to genome evolution, since there are genes encoding for proteins allocated in different compartments. To test whether this is true, we can use a proxy for the number of evolutionary events (e.g. mutations, duplications, etc.). One simple yet unregarded way is to calculate the diversity of unique sequences assigned to a biochemical function (KEGG) across species. Given similar diversity of species in particular environments, the expectation for any KEGG is to be represented by a similar number of sequences. We can give answer to the question comparing this metric between metastable communities with differential values of temperature and pH. In this work, we examine the sequence diversity among 17 metagenomes from El Tatio geothermal field (Chile), spanning temperatures of 45-62{degrees}C, and pH values of 7.2-9.3. We found that, when controlling for abundance, higher temperature (>56{degrees}C) increases, while basic pH (>8.1) decreases the expected by-function diversity. The inclusion of these variables improved the prediction of sequence diversity from metagenomic abundance. Between-compartment diversity was more affected by pH than by temperature. Protein length distributions and individual, well-known taxa from hydrothermal springs showed compatible trends. Overall, our results suggest that sequence diversity is universally governed by the signature buffering of the stable compartments to some of the outside-cell factors, besides the taxonomic trends or the particularities of any function. Altogether, we provide evidence against the temperature-induced gene loss hypotheses, and in favor of the confined evolution hypothesis.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

High-throughput migration assays generate complex, hierarchically structured datasets with technical noise, batch effects, and biological variability, introducing significant uncertainty into velocity estimates. Current statistical approaches often fail to rigorously quantify this uncertainty, undermining reproducibility and comparability across independent experimental datasets. To address this challenge, we present cellmig, a computational tool that employs Bayesian hierarchical modeling to separate biological signals from technical variation while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in migration velocity. Results: cellmig provides a robust framework for analyzing cell migration assays, including dose-response studies and large-scale screens with multiple biological and technical replicates. By modeling biological variability (e.g., compound-dependent effects) and technical confounders (e.g., batch variability) within a unified Bayesian framework, cellmig estimates condition-specific effects on cell velocity with probabilistic uncertainty intervals, avoiding common pitfalls associated with null-hypothesis testing. Additionally, its generative models enable simulation of migration velocities under various assumptions, aiding experimental planning.

The shared precursor hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), however, has not yet been considered as a biological marker of language ability, despite emerging evidence that fetal DHEA plays a critical role in the organization of the neonatal brain. The present study investigated whether fetal DHEA, compared to fetal testosterone, is associated with infant language development. Design and methods. DHEA and testosterone concentrations were measured in newborn hair strands (n = 56) collected two weeks after birth, capturing fetal long term hormone secretions during the third trimester of pregnancy. At six months of age, children's language abilities were assessed using the German version of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Results. Linear regression analysis revealed fetal DHEA levels to be significantly associated with language abilities at six months of age, with lower DHEA levels corresponding to higher language scores. Control analyses assessing general cognitive abilities showed no association of fetal DHEA levels with infant cognitive function. Testosterone levels were not associated with language nor general cognitive skills. Conclusions.

Here, we combined genomic profiling and in vivo assays to investigate OSKM-mediated reprogramming of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In the initial stages, we found that cancer-specific genes were refractory while mesodermal/ECM programs - normally silenced by PRC2 - were aberrantly upregulated. A CRISPR interference screen for OSKM reprogramming coupled with functional analyses revealed that suppression of cancer-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) erased malignant epithelial programs, restored tumor suppressor activity, and impaired tumorigenicity in vivo. Mechanistically, ATXN7L3-AS1 lncRNA enforces the malignant identity of PDAC by activating epithelial cancer- associated programs while keeping PRC2-target developmental genes in a poised state, thereby sustaining both plasticity and malignancy.

Throughfall-mediated cell fluxes equaled those in seepage below the litter layer, pointing to a substantial above-ground translocation of bacteria. Bacterial cells contributed up to 11 % and 33 % to the exported total organic carbon and total nitrogen, respectively. Bacteria affiliated with Pseudomonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Hymenobacteraceae, and Sphingomonadaceae were differentially transmitted from the canopy with increased abundances in throughfall and stemflow compared to bulk rain. A small fraction of shared taxa pointed to the import, proliferation and mobilization of selected bacterial taxa between neighboring ecohydrological compartments.

We find that environmental interactions are critical, with the effect of temperature on flocculation being inverted by changes in salinity (P~ExE). Multi-stress reaction norms are genotype-dependent (P~GxExE), revealing that evolution can adopt diverse strategies to deal with ExE interactions. We further show that the covariation between traits (PxP) is itself a plastic and evolvable feature. The relationship between growth and flocculation changed from negative to positive or completely uncoupled, depending on the specific GxExE context. This context-dependent covariation suggests that clonal variability and stochastic processes modulate phenotypic outcomes beyond deterministic genotypic effects.

Participants (N = 25) listened to audiobook content (> 12,000 words) while providing self-reports of mind-wandering. Mind-wandering was associated with spectral changes in the EEG signal, compared to attentive listening, as well as decreased early response to word onset, in line with current accounts. In contrast, EEG markers of word-level contextual surprise (indexed by the contextual surprise of large language models) remained intact during mind-wandering, alongside significant encoding of semantic content. Last, we measured the neural encoding of predictive context, measured by the correlation between EEG activity and the vectorial embeddings that language models use to predict each word given prior context. This encoding also persisted during mind-wandering, albeit weaker compared to attentive periods. Our findings show that the brain predicts and monitors relevant inputs even when the subjective experience of the external environment is dimmed during mind wandering.

This study investigated whether RF status in SS is associated with distinct autoantibody profiles and greater immunological similarity to RA. We analyzed a synthetic dataset (n=176), including 91 RA patients and 85 SS patients (38 RF-positive, 45 RF-negative), across four autoantibodies: anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), and anti-Smith (anti-Sm). Statistical analyses included t-tests, Chi squared, Effect sizes, ANOVA, MANOVA, Euclidean distance measures, and logistic regression. RF-positive SS showed similar ACPA levels to RA in Welch's T-tests, whereas RF-negative SS differed significantly in ANA and anti-dsDNA, consistent with a lupus-like profile within ANOVA. MANOVA and distance analyses indicated that RF-positive SS is immunologically closer to RA, while RF-negative SS forms a distinct cluster. Logistic regression supported moderate-low classification performance. Overall, these findings may support the hypothesis of an RF-associated SS subtype overlapping with RA and highlight the potential of RF testing to improve disease stratification and guide therapeutic decisions.

G.", "abstract": "In electrically coupled networks, the coupling coefficient (CC) quantifies the strength of the connectivity or the degree to which two participating nodes are coupled in response to an external input to one of them. The CC is measured by computing the relative responses of the indirectly activated (post-J) and the directly activated (pre-J) nodes. In response to time-dependent inputs, the CC is frequency-dependent and has two components capturing the contributions of the amplitude and phase frequency profiles of the participating nodes (quotient of the amplitudes and phase-difference, respectively). The properties and mechanisms of generation of the frequency-dependent CCs (FD-CCs) are largely unknown beyond electrically coupled passive cells and their electrical circuit equivalents. Being linear and 1D, the FD-CCs for passive cells are relatively simple, consisting of low-pass filters (amplitude) and positive and monotonically increasing phase-difference profiles. In linear systems, the FD-CCs depend on the properties of the pre-J cell and the connectivity and are independent of the properties of the post-J cell and the input amplitude. There is a gap in our understanding of the FD-CCs are shaped by (i) how the presence of intrinsic cellular positive and negative feedback currents and the resulting amplification and resonance phenomena, and (ii) the presence of cellular nonlinearities that incorporates the dependence of the FD-CC on the post-J node in addition to the pre-J one. In this paper we address these issues by using biophysically plausible (conductance-based) mathematical modeling, numerical simulations, analytical calculations and dynamical systems tools. We conduct a systematic analysis of the properties of the FD-CC in networks of two electrically connected nodes receiving oscillatory inputs, which is the minimal network architecture that allows for a systematic study of the biophysical and dynamic mechanisms that shape the FD-CC profiles. The participating neurons are either passive cells (low-pass filters) or resonators (band-pass filter) and exhibit lagging or mixed leading-lagging phase-shift responses as the input frequency increases. The formalism and tools we develop and use in this paper can be extended to larger networks with an arbitrary number of nodes, to spatially extended multicompartment neuronal models, and to neurons having a variety of ionic currents. The principles that emerge from our study are directly applicable to these scenarios. Our results make experimentally testable predictions and have implications for the understanding of spike transmission, synchronized firing and coincidence detection in electrically coupled networks in the presence of oscillatory inputs.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short, often cationic, peptide-based molecules with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity, which makes them promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics in poultry production. From a prior machine-learning-guided screen of 875 candidate AMPs, 62 exhibited activity against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) and low in vitro hemolytic and cytotoxic activity. We selected three lead AMPs from this list (named TeRu4, TeBi1, and PeNi4), and evaluated their in vitro and in vivo efficacy, safety, and immunomodulatory potential for use in poultry farming. In animal experiments, AMPs were administered via in ovo injection on day 18 of embryonic development. In APEC challenge trials, yolk sacs were inoculated with APEC post-hatch to assess early chick mortality, while in pen trials, birds were raised in a commercial production setting for 35 days. For challenged birds, TeBi1 (10 g/egg) significantly reduced bacterial detection in the air sac and pericardium, increased body weight by 50% and reduced cytokine transcript levels by 10-30% on day 7 post hatch. In HD11 chicken macrophage-like cultured cells, TeRu4 (16 g/mL) suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine transcript levels. In pen trials, TeRu4 (20 g/egg) increased the survival probability of female birds by 4.9%, while TeBi1 (20 g/egg) increased the survival probability of all birds by 4.4%, by day 35. Gene expression analysis revealed AMP- and sex-specific cytokine responses. In pen trials, no significant differences were observed in mean weights, feed conversion ratio, and flock uniformity on day 35.

Among these, cognitive inflexibility and executive dysfunction are particularly prominent, yet the temporal dynamics of the frontoparietal control network (FPN), a core substrate of cognitive control, remain poorly understood. Using harmonized resting-state fMRI data from the REST- meta-MDD consortium (n = 887; 442 MDD, 445 healthy controls), we investigated dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) within the FPN. Time-varying correlations among 21 FPN nodes were estimated using a sliding-window approach and clustered via k-means to identify recurring connectivity states. Temporal metrics included fractional occupancy, mean dwell time, and transition counts. Three unique FPN states were recognized. In comparison to healthy individuals, those with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) exhibited prolonged durations in a hypoconnected state, extended dwell times in this configuration, and fewer total transitions, indicating diminished neural flexibility. Direct transitions between low-connectivity (hypoconnected) and high-connectivity (hyperconnected) states were selectively diminished, indicating a disruption in the direct transition between two functionally distinct states of the FPN. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental disruption in the temporal organization of frontoparietal connectivity in MDD, marked by predominant hypoconnectivity, reduced flexibility, and constrained state transitions.

The pathological hallmark is the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are intraneuronal lesions enriched in aggregated alpha-synuclein (S) that is typically hyper-phosphorylated at serine 129. Therefore, lowering phosphoserine 129 (pS129) may be a viable therapeutic strategy to treat PD. However, pS129 has also been proposed to regulate synaptic transmission and S degradation. In both cases, inhibiting pS129 could be detrimental. Here, we developed a sensitive assay in a human neuroblastoma model and utilized it to assess the relative expression levels and cytotoxicity of pS129 by comparing S wild-type (WT) vs. S129A (pS129-deficient). We show that the S129A mutant does not affect the acute expression levels or toxicity of S in a transient transfection paradigm. This provides new insight into the intricate interplay between S, phosphorylation, toxicity, and degradation.

The nomenclature \"AI\" reflects integration within a larger artificial-intelligence pipeline; the filter itself requires no prior training or deep learning. A single tuning parameter controls filter strength. The design supports streaming windows ({approx}1 s) with minimal added latency and extends naturally to longer offline segments; leveraging a sensor-fusion design across channels, it suggests applicability to other neurophysiological time-series, such as MEG and ECoG, pending further validation; exploratory incorporation of EOG/ECG as auxiliary signals is a potential avenue for future filter advancements.\n\nWe evaluate the approach across multiple devices and public datasets, assessing both down-stream AI classification performance and real-time signal-quality metrics. In both real-time and offline settings, the filter performed better on dynamic artifacts and noise than baseline and commonly used alternatives in our evaluations. When applied in conjunction with other methods, it was only observed to improve downstream accuracy, never reduce it, when any effect was present. Denoising is quantified using SNR-like measures, and ablations isolate the roles of spatial coupling and band weighting. Artifact-specific analyses (ocular bursts, head tilt, jaw clench) and latency profiling on commodity hardware are included.

The network was used in two complementary control strategies: a learned inverse network for real-time stimulation synthesis and a gradient-based optimizer for precise targeting of desired neural responses. Both approaches significantly outperformed conventional methods in controlling neural activity, required lower stimulation currents, and adapted stimulation parameters to resting state data, reliably evoking more stable percepts. Crucially, recorded neural responses better predicted perceptual outcomes than stimulation parameters alone, underscoring the value of our neural population control framework.

Although existing analytical methods provide high sensitivity, they often require complex instrumentation with limited on-site applications, and generate hazardous waste, raising environmental concerns. At present, whole-cell biosensors provide an empirical alternative, utilizing cellular machinery for sensitive detection of metals. In a relevant context, intein-mediated protein splicing, a spontaneous post-translational process, can be adapted for biosensing by coupling metal-dependent splicing inhibition with whole-cell sensing units. Current research elucidates how toxic metal ions, including cadmium (Cd2+), mercury (Hg2+), chromium (Cr3+), and lead (Pb2+), influence the splicing and N-terminal cleavage reactions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) SufB precursor protein. While Cd2+; and Hg2+; significantly attenuated the splicing activity of Mtb SufB precursor protein over a concentration range of 25 uM to 2 mM, Pb2+; and Cr3+; failed to do so. Next, an innovative biosensor platform was designed to detect these metal ions by utilizing splicing inhibition in metal-sensitive Mtb SufB precursor protein within attenuated Mtb (H37Ra) cells. Metal-induced splicing inhibition led to loss of viability in H37Ra indicator cells, while specificity of this detection system was confirmed by adding respective metal chelators. Multiplexing and quantitative efficacy of the designed biosensor was evaluated by including known splicing inhibitors like Cu2+, Zn2+, and Pt4+ over various concentration range alongside Cd2+; and Hg2+;. The developed biosensor offers a cost-effective, user-friendly, specific, and sensitive assay that does not require advanced instrumentation facility.

While its genome-wide occupancy has primarily been linked to transcriptional regulation, its potential role in DNA replication control remains less well defined. In this study, we investigated BRG1 involvement in replication origin regulation by integrating BRG1 ChIP-seq data with replication origin mapping and chromatin state analyses. Our results revealed that BRG1 is preferentially enriched at genomic regions characterized by DNase I hypersensitivity, low GC content, and a capacity to form G-quadruplex structures hallmarks of dormant replication origins. Notably, BRG1-bound sites were also enriched in late-replicating, heterochromatic regions. These findings suggest a specific association of BRG1 with dormant replication origins. To validate this association, we performed functional assays in HeLa cells. BRG1 depletion via siRNA led to reduced replication fork progression and increased activation of dormant origins, consistent with replication stress. Mechanistically, we found that BRG1 physically interacts with the mitotic kinase PLK1. Loss of BRG1 reduced chromatin-bound levels of both BRG1 and PLK1, implicating BRG1 in PLK1 recruitment or stability. Importantly, overexpression of PLK1 in BRG1-depleted cells rescued replication fork progression, supporting a cooperative role for BRG1 and PLK1 in regulating replication through dormant origins.

In the present work, we propose simple methods that exploit existing workflows developed for materials science analyses and demonstrate on-grid in situ assessment of ice crystallinity with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) on a direct electron detector (DED) in a cryo-scanning-electron microscope (SEM).

Custom grid holders and jigs were developed to integrate the clipped cryo-TEM grids and evolve the sample preparation workflow. EBSD detects hexagonal ice in some areas of the samples, whereas other areas show an absence of EBSD signal, consistent with vitreous ice, that enable targeting the further steps of sample preparation for cryo-TEM. Off-axis transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) was attempted, but led to severe damage to polished TEM-lamellae and appears unsuitable.

But is the converse true: can the prediction of future fasting rapidly activate AgRP neurons? Here we show that such rapid fasting activation of AgRP neurons does occur. This fasting response is driven by excitatory input from paraventricular hypothalamic neurons expressing Sim2, which are bidirectionally sensitive to predictions of future energy state. In this way, cognitively-processed contextual information conveyed by PVH-Sim2 neurons strongly activates AgRP neurons. Lastly, chronic silencing of PVH-Sim2 neurons causes persistent hypophagia.

Previously, we demonstrated that gene-environment interactions driven by pro-inflammatory factors can induce this methylation, downregulate E-cadherin expression, and impair neural crest migration, thereby contributing to the etiology of CLP.

However, the role of bacteriophages that may inhibit microbialization by infecting and killing these bacteria remains poorly understood, especially their metabolic impacts on bacterial proliferation. To address this, we analyzed central carbon metabolism gene frequencies in viral communities from healthy (lytic-dominated) and degraded (temperate-dominated) Central Pacific coral reefs. We found that viral metabolism shifted broadly from being dominated by metabolism that builds up pools of central intermediates on degraded reefs dominated by temperate viral infection (\"anaplerotic\" reactions) to metabolism that consumes these pools to prioritize production of metabolic precursors for virion construction on healthy reefs dominated by lytic infection (\"cataplerotic\" reactions). This switch was shown by the over-representation of Entner-Doudoroff (ED) glycolysis genes on degraded, temperate-dominated reefs and of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) genes on healthy, lytic-dominated reefs. As a result of this metabolic dichotomy, our qualitative compartment modeling revealed two distinct ecosystem states: (i) healthy reefs, where lytic viral metabolism enhances viral production and suppresses bacterial overgrowth, and (ii) degraded reefs, where temperate viral metabolism accelerates bacterial proliferation. Because viral switching between lytic and temperate lifestyles is a known function of host physiological state, these findings position viral metabolism as both a driver of reef decline and a conservation lever, with metabolically mediated \"re-viralization\" offering a novel strategy to restore reef resilience.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Viviparity (live-bearing) is a complex reproductive mode transition having more than 100 independent origins in squamate reptiles, making it an ideal model to understand the molecular basis of evolutionary innovations. Here we used 141 squamate genomes, including 42 viviparous species and representing more than 18 independent evolutionary transitions to viviparity, to search for convergent molecular signals in 14,096 protein coding genes. We show that convergent positive selection associated with viviparity at the gene-level and amino acid substitutions at the site-level are widespread in squamates, but there is no universal convergence across all viviparous clades. The chance of molecular convergence associated with viviparity is negatively correlated with genetic distance between species. Nevertheless, convergent genes are shared across independent origins of viviparity even spanning deep divergence times, and these genes are enriched in viviparity-related biological processes, including placental development, nutrient transport, and immune response to external organisms. Our result demonstrates that molecular convergence in the evolution of complex traits decreases in likelihood with evolutionary time, but when it occurs is more likely through changes in different genes of similar functional pathway rather than changes in the same genes.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

In sexually reproducing populations, the challenge of finding mates at low densities can impose a strong demographic Allee effect. When such a population falls below the Allee threshold, either through a reduction of the population size or an increase in the threshold, successful adaptation relies on overcoming the Allee effect, which gets increasingly difficult as the population declines. Despite mate-finding Allee effects being common, most models of evolutionary rescue assume that mating is assured even at low densities. Here, we set up a population genetic model for evolutionary rescue of a population below its Allee threshold. For the analysis, we combine stochastic computer simulations with mathematical arguments. As expected, mate limitation can severely impede rescue but the extent differs across sexual systems. We further show that mate limitation shifts the optimal sex ratio for dioecious populations, alters optimal evolutionary routes when there are trade-offs between increasing mate-finding efficiency and fecundity, and enhances the importance of standing genetic variation relative to de novo mutants. Overall, our results highlight the importance of accounting for positive density dependence in the assessment of a population's scope for evolutionary rescue.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

A common assumption in life-history theory is that intra-species lifespan variation can be explained by trade-offs between reproduction and survival, i.e., individuals investing more in early-life reproduction are expected to live shorter. However, the trade-off assumption can mask alternative models. For example, individual quality could affect reproduction and survival in the same direction; e.g., high-quality individuals may both reproduce more and live longer. Here, we study the naturally short-lived turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), an annual teleost with a limited reproductive window, which, according to the trade-off model, should generate a selective pressure that maximizes individual investment in early-life reproduction, at the expense of survival. To test the individual co-variation in reproduction and lifespan, we focused on males and performed IVFs using ejaculates collected longitudinally throughout life. Unlike the trade-off expectation, we found that reproduction outcomes of young individuals positively correlate with male lifespan, suggesting that early-life reproduction is a bona fide proxy for intrinsic individual quality. Using a causal-informed simulation, we showed that a parsimonious model where i) intrinsic quality affects both lifespan and reproduction and ii) age negatively impacts reproduction, largely recapitulates the observed data, including lifespan prediction from early-life reproduction. Our findings challenge the assumption that reproductive costs are the primary drivers of lifespan variation and instead highlight intrinsic quality as a key common cause to both lifespan and reproduction.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

While these correlations suggest a role for local adaptation, the underlying selective mechanisms remain unresolved. Critically, few experiments have yet tested the fitness consequences of these inversions under controlled environmental conditions. Such work is essential to establish causality. Here, we conducted an acute stressor experiment with ten treatments of combined temperature and low salinity stress. Cod eggs (N = 1265) were placed into each treatment for 24 hours, and the number of individuals that floated initially and finally was counted. The ability of an egg to float is directly related to its survival, as sunk individuals cannot survive, and individuals lose buoyancy after they die. Inversion genotypes for the inversions on chromosomes 2, 7, and 12 were determined for individuals from the T03-S25, T07-S25, T16-S25, and T16-S35 treatments. We found that sinking increased with temperature and that more individuals sank in 25 ppt than in 35 ppt after 24 hours. Interestingly, some individuals in the 25 ppt treatments recovered (sank initially but floated finally) after 24 hours. We found evidence that the inversions on chromosomes 2 and 12 might assist with temperature and salinity adaptation, respectively, in cod eggs, while the inversion on chromosome 7 did not affect floating.

Microbiome composition varies widely across insect taxa and is shaped by multiple factors, including host phylogeny, environmental conditions, geographic distribution, and nutritional ecology. One hypothesis is that microbiome composition may also reflect whether the host adopts a generalist or specialist ecological strategy. We tested this hypothesis using the sucking louse Polyplax serrata, which offers several advantages as a model system. First, as permanent ectoparasites, lice inhabit a relatively stable and simplified environment, thereby minimizing potential confounding variables. Second, within P. serrata, two closely related lineages have been identified: one restricted to a single rodent host (Apodemus flavicollis), and the other exploiting two hosts (A. flavicollis and A. sylvaticus). We analyzed and compared microbiome structure in these two lineages using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. While alpha diversity did not differ between the lineages, beta diversity differed significantly, particularly in pairwise dissimilarities among individual samples. These results suggest that in P. serrata, host specialization strategy influences microbiome diversity, with the \"generalist\" lineage harboring more heterogeneous communities. This finding extends previous observations on ecological divergence between the two lineages, showing that closely related cryptic species with highly similar genomes, living sympatrically in the same environment, can rapidly evolve distinct life strategies that, in turn, shape both their genetic structure and their microbiomes.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of 152 F. graminearum isolates to propiconazole and tebuconazole. While sensitivity varied among isolates, no resistant strains were detected. We also conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the genetic basis of DMI sensitivity.

Candidate gene analysis highlighted genes encoding transporters, secondary metabolite synthesis enzymes, transcription factors, and a heat shock protein as potential candidates for DMI fungicide response.

Here, we present chromosome-level genomes for the two-toed sloth (<Choloepus didactylus>) and the southern anteater (<Tamandua tetradactyla>), and investigate how retrotransposon-mediated gene duplications (retrocopies) have shaped xenarthran genome evolution. Comparative analyses revealed that xenarthran genomes harbor the highest number of retrocopies reported among mammals, with lineage-specific insertion dynamics. Anteater and armadillo genomes contain older LINE1 repertoires and species-specific older retrocopy insertions. In contrast, sloths retain both an abundance of young LINE1s and thousands of young retrocopies, alongside a large shared set that originated from an evolutionary burst of retroduplication in the branch leading to their last common ancestor (~30 Mya). In C. didactylus, approximately 50% of retrocopies are expressed, compared with 24% in Dasypus novemcinctus. Evolutionary analyses identified 38 retrocopies with strong hallmarks of domestication in C. didactylus. Many of these retrocopies derive from parental genes involved in mitochondrial and metabolic processes, suggesting a genomic mechanism underlying the physiological specialisations of sloths. Altogether, our findings identify retrotransposition as a major contributor to the genomic architecture of Xenarthra and highlight retrocopy origination as a mechanism for generating lineage-specific novelty and distinctive biological specialisations.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Ultraviolet (UV)-induced mutagenesis and adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) were used to select for mutants with higher tolerance to these inhibitors.

A second operation is then needed to implant the construct in continuity with the intestine. The timing of the second operation has historically been chosen based on pre-determined biological endpoints. Currently, no well-validated method has been used to non-invasively monitor for vascular maturity which would better inform when the second operation should be performed. We hypothesized that photoacoustic imaging (PAI) could serve as a tool to non-invasively monitor regional and temporal changes in vascular maturity in scaffolds implanted in the omentum. For this pilot study, tubular scaffolds used for TESI were fabricated with electrospinning and implanted in the omentum of Sprague-Dawley rats for 1 and 2 months. Scaffolds were imaged with PAI and tissue oxygenation and hemoglobin concentration were quantified. PAI was then correlated with gross observations of vascularization at each time point. PAI was able to determine regional and temporal changes in tissue oxygenation and hemoglobin concentration. Specifically, the oxygenation and hemoglobin concentration of the top wall of the construct showed better vascular maturity compared to the bottom wall. In addition, vascular maturity seemed to improve in the top wall from 1 to 2 months. The bottom wall was not well covered by the omentum and thus did not vascularize as well as the top wall. The PAI findings were confirmed on gross examination of the scaffolds and upon quantification of the histological analysis of endothelial cell density. Thus, PAI may serve as a critical tool for monitoring vascular maturity in TE, specifically within the abdomen.

We validated the significance of these conserved regions for drug discovery using existing experimental data. Our analysis revealed notably high sequence similarity among proteins from filoviruses capable of infecting humans (EBOV, TAFV, BDBV, SUDV, MARV, and RAVV) compared to those from non-zoonotic species, with the highest conservation observed in the L and VP40 proteins - both critical for viral genome transcription and replication.

Counterintuitively, existing purification protocols with UV-shadowing can increase impurities that disrupt circuit behavior. Specifically, we demonstrate that UV exposure (i) reduces DSD reaction percent yield and (ii) leads to a phenomenon we call \"negative leak,\" where high-concentration double-stranded complexes that are designed to be inert can sequester functional signal strands and thus disrupt circuit performance.

Using RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dscam1 in giant fiber interneurons, we observed reduced presynaptic terminal volume, smaller synapse interfaces, and reduced levels of electrical (Shak-B) and chemical (Bruchpilot) synaptic proteins. Despite this reduction in overall abundance, protein localization and density remained unchanged. Functionally, Dscam1 knockdown impaired circuit performance, both increasing latency and reducing success at high frequency demand. Correlation and principal component analysis of our data set show that anatomical variables, particularly presynaptic terminal size, best predicted circuit output. These findings identify Dscam1 as a key developmental regulator of presynaptic terminal size, linking early axon terminal elaboration to adult synaptic function in a central motor circuit. More broadly, our results exemplify a volumetric scaling model where available presynaptic area constrains the distribution of synaptic proteins, both electrical and chemical.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

The V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cell receptor (TCR), expressed by the predominant subset of {gamma}{delta} T cells, responds to phosphoantigen (pAg)-engaged butyrophilins (BTNs) on various cancer cells. Numerous preclinical and clinical trials targeting V{gamma}9V{delta}2 TCRs and BTNs are currently underway. However, the molecular mechanism underlying pAg-mediated activation of V{gamma}9V{delta}2 TCRs remains a subject of debate. In this study, we employed an integrative approach to elucidate the mechanism of pAg reactivity in V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells. We found that BTNs form higher-order oligomers in the absence of pAg. Upon pAg binding, these oligomers dissociate into tetramers, enabling the association of the V{gamma}9V{delta}2 TCR. This dissociation of higher-order BTN complexes is critical for pAg-mediated activation of {gamma}{delta} T cells.

In social groups, individuals often face asymmetric infection risks based on their behavioural roles, raising the possibility that immune defences are plastically adjusted according to risk. In social insects, this idea has led to the hypothesis that individuals performing high-risk tasks, such as foraging, should invest more in constitutive immune defences to reduce transmission within the colony. However, testing this hypothesis has been hindered by confounding effects of genotype, age, and infection history. We use the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi to overcome these limitations. In this system, spontaneous behavioural specialisation between genetically identical, age-matched individuals creates variation in infection risk, while controlling for other sources of variation. We first annotated the O. biroi immune gene repertoire and sequenced the transcriptomes of individuals that showed considerable behavioural variation. We then combined fine-scale individual behavioural tracking with three complementary measures of immune investment: immune-related gene expression, antibacterial activity, and survival following infection. Despite behavioural specialisation, we find no evidence that individuals engaging in higher-risk behaviours invest more in constitutive immune defences. These results contradict a long-standing hypothesis in the field and suggest limits to plastic immune allocation based on infection risk in social insect colonies.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

P.; Garcia-Roa, R.; Wigby, S.; Sepil, I.; Carazo, P.", "abstract": "Seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are key mediators of post-mating interactions, shaping fertility, sperm use and female physiology with major consequences for both sexes. Because they often enhance male fitness while imposing costs on females, SFPs are central to sexual selection and sexual conflict. Their composition and allocation strategies are influenced by both environmental conditions and male state. However, how abiotic ecological factors regulate SFP expression, and how this interacts with sperm competition risk, remains poorly understood. Here, we use adult flies from a wild Drosophila melanogaster population to test how exposure to natural temperature variation (20{degrees}C, 24{degrees}C and 28{degrees}C) across two-time scales (48h and 13d), and under either no or high sperm competition risk, interact to shape SFP production and transfer to females. SFP production and transfer profiles were significantly affected by temperature, both consistently reduced after long-term (13d) exposure to low (20{degrees}C) and high (28{degrees}C) temperatures, compared to 24{degrees}C. Proteins from the sex peptide and ovulin networks, which mediate female post-copulatory responses and are key to male fitness, followed this same pattern. Our results show that natural temperature fluctuations, well within the optimal reproductive range for flies in the wild, can have a strong effect on SFP production and transfer, and thus on post-copulatory sexual selection dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

This could be particularly relevant for morphological datasets used in phylogenetics, as they usually consist of few dozens to few hundreds of characters--orders of magnitude smaller than most molecular datasets. I designed a simulation study in the software RevBayes to explore how the number of sampled discrete characters affects accuracy and precision of Bayesian phylogenetic estimates, under various setups differing in number of taxa, average number of state changes per character (i.e., tree length), and number of states per character. Results indicate that between 100 and 500 variable characters are necessary to reach sufficient accuracy and precision of phylogenetic estimates for as low as 20 tips. All other parameters being equal, multistate characters produce slightly more accurate estimates than binary characters, and more labile characters produce more accurate estimates for trees above 50 tips.

In particular, the study of non-coding genomic variation remains a major challenge due to the lack of accurate functional annotation for activity in a given context and across alleles. Experimental evidence is critical for prioritizing and interpreting functional effects of genetic alterations. Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) have emerged as a powerful high-throughput approach, enabling quantification of regulatory element activity and allelic effects, and systematic dissection of gene regulatory logic and variant effects across different contexts. However, the diversity of MPRA designs, lack of standardized formats, and many potential processing parameters hamper data integration, reproducibility, and meta-analyses across studies. To address these challenges, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium established an MPRA focus group to develop community standards, including harmonized file formats, and robust analysis pipelines for a wide range of library types and experimental designs. Here, we present these formats and comprehensive computational tools, MPRAlib and MPRAsnakeflow, for uniform processing from raw sequencing reads to counts, processing and visualization. Using diverse MPRA datasets, we characterize technical variability sources including barcode sequence bias, outlier barcodes, and delivery method (episomal vs. lentiviral).

By leveraging existing molecular biological knowledge, we reconstructed a multi-layered metabolic regulatory network to systematically map the interplay between mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites in AD. Our analysis revealed a coordinated downregulation of energy producing pathways, including the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ketone body metabolism, driven by reduced enzyme abundance and inhibitory allosteric effects.

Although Syn aggregation has been extensively characterized, its evolutionary origins and sequence determinants remain unresolved. Here, we use ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) to trace the emergence of fibril-forming ability in the synuclein family. We inferred synuclein phylogeny and experimentally resurrected common ancestors, including ROOT synuclein, the last common ancestor of all synucleins, and key intermediates along the Syn lineage. Strikingly, ROOT synuclein is non-aggregating, demonstrating that fibril formation is an evolved, rather than ancestral property. Aggregation first emerges at the ancestral {beta} node, is retained in Syn, and suppressed in {beta}-synuclein. Biophysical analyses including mass spectrometry and NMR reveal that aggregation aligns with greater complexity and heterogeneity in the monomer conformational ensemble, suggesting that evolutionary sequence changes progressively remodel monomer landscapes to favor fibril formation. Complementing these insights, comparative sequence analysis reveals that the transition from ROOT to -WT is marked by the stepwise acquisition of residues critical for stabilizing the fibril core. Early mutations stabilized the {beta}-arch core, enabling the onset of fibril formation, followed by substitutions that reinforce protofilament-protofilament interactions.

No prior study has systematically quantified the adaptive landscape from prostate organogenesis through tumor initiation and progression to metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), nor characterized the selective epistatic interactions that structure this evolutionary trajectory. Methods and Findings To address this gap, we analyzed 2,704 low- and high-risk primary tumors and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers to quantify the mutation rates, mutational processes, and scaled selection coefficients of somatic mutations across disease stages. Trinucleotide mutational patterns were stable, but both mutation load and mutation rates increased with progression. In parallel, selective pressures on specific somatic mutations changed substantially, revealing a dynamic adaptive landscape. Stage-specific selective effects were associated with significant synergistic and antagonistic selective epistasis among key driver genes. Early selection on SPOP mutations in the BRD3 binding domain were under strong positive selection, and they increased selection for subsequent RHOA mutations while decreasing selection for TP53 mutations. Antagonistic selective epistasis was evident between mutations of CUL3 and both SPOP and PIK3CA. Mutations in KMT2C increased the selection for mutations in TP53, consistent with their frequent co-occurrence. Synergistic epistatic interactions between mutations of PTEN and both PIK3CA and AR support a strong therapeutic rationale for combined inhibition of PI3K/AR pathway in PTEN-deficient prostate cancers. Conclusions These findings provide a comprehensive map of the evolving selective and epistatic forces that shape prostate cancer progression across clinical stages.

Tumors carrying activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are highly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with third-generation inhibitors such as Osimertinib now established as standard of care. However, acquired resistance to Osimertinib inevitably develops, involving both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms, the latter playing a major role in sustaining cellular plasticity and promoting tumor aggressiveness. Among regulators of adaptive programs, the Polycomb protein BMI1 has emerged as a key factor driving stemness, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and therapy resistance in multiple cancers, yet its role in Osimertinib resistance remains poorly defined. Here, we show that Osimertinib-resistant H1975 cells, which display greater aggressiveness than their parental counterparts, are enriched in BMI1 target genes and mitotic cell-cycle pathways, establishing a dependency on microtubule dynamics and mitotic control. Functionally, BMI1 drives migration, invasiveness, and tumor progression in resistant cells. This mitotic dependency creates a therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited with Unesbulin (PTC596), a BMI1 inhibitor that destabilizes microtubules and induces mitotic catastrophe, thereby effectively suppressing tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.

Here, we applied a novel procedure that implements structural connectivity-informed spectral dynamic causal modelling to examine how structural connectivity shapes directed inter-regional influences in premanifest Huntingtons disease gene expansion carriers (HDGECs) with and without depression history. Method: Using spectral dynamic causal modeling embedded in a hierarchical empirical Bayes framework, we analyzed fMRI data from 98 premanifest HDGECs across default mode network and striatum (caudate and putamen). HDGECs were split into two groups based on either having a history of depression or not, and depression severity on both the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd Edition (BDI-II) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Depression Subscale (HADS-D) was used to measure clinically elevated depression symptoms. Leave-one-out cross-validation was implemented to test predictive validity. Results: Model evidence substantially favored structurally informed over uninformed approaches across all participants. For HDGECs, having a history of depression was associated with reduced baseline variability in effective connectivity (decreased  parameter), with particularly tight regularization of near-zero-valued structural connections toward zero effective connectivity values while leaving strongly connected pathways relatively unaffected. Effects converged on striatal self-connectivity and hippocampal-striatal pathways, with distinct patterns emerging between depression history groups. Notably, clinically elevated depression revealed differential connectivity signatures, with right caudate self-connectivity showing positive correlations with clinical cut-offs for HDGECs with and without depression history. In leave-one-out cross-validation, specific connections including DMN-to-striatum (BDI: r = -0.31, p = .002; HADS-D: r = -0.33, p = .001), right hippocampus-to-left caudate (BDI: r = -0.46, p < .001; HADS-D: r = -0.30, p = .002), and left caudate-to-left putamen (BDI: r = -0.48, p < .001; HADS-D: r = -0.30, p = .003) significantly predicted individual differences in depression severity scores. Conclusion : Together, these findings link reduced network flexibility to depression vulnerability in premanifest neurodegeneration, providing a mechanistic bridge between anatomical constraints, effective connectivity alterations, and clinical depression phenotypes.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Chromatin remodeling complexes and CTCF are key regulators of these processes by controlling specific patterns of gene expression across gamete development. Although the CHD4 chromatin remodeler and CTCF have been implicated in spermatogonia development, a mechanism explaining their cooperation is missing. We also do not know CHD4 and CTCF role in later stages of spermatogenesis. Our studies reveal that germ cell-specific deletion of CHD4 results in spermatogonia development defects and affects meiotic-specific functions such as homologous chromosome synapsis. Combined analysis of genome-wide chromatin binding and single cell gene transcription showed that CHD4 controls specific gene expression programs important for spermatogonia differentiation, transition into meiosis, and meiotic specific processes. Mechanistically, this can be explained by a pervasive role for CHD4 in controlling CTCF chromatin binding and transcriptional function. The discovery of a functional interplay between CHD4 and CTCF reveals a novel axis of gene expression control, integrating chromatin structure and transcriptional outcomes. This interaction is essential in orchestrating early testis development and meiotic processes, ensuring that the correct number of chromosomes is faithfully transmitted to the next generation.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

While the anatomy and physiology of these sensory pathways is well described, their neural code and its construction remains unclear. Here we show that neurons in the cervical spinal cord generate a precise neural representation of the forelimb's kinematic state using muscle and tendon sensory afferent inputs. We identify two classes of movement responsive neurons - the first encodes speed, position and direction of the limb, while the second exhibits precise firing at specific limb positions or grid-like firing patterns that tile space. Their composite population activity is constrained to a low dimensional manifold that is an ordered representation of the position and velocity of the limb. Ablating muscle and tendon sensory afferents, but not cutaneous sensory afferents, disrupts this neural manifold. Moreover, transient perturbations of muscle and tendon afferents in freely moving mice reaching to spatial targets cause end-point errors as predicted by the deficits in the neural code. Our findings demonstrate that spinal networks, one synapse from the periphery, perform the complex computations necessary to represent forelimb movement.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Using this approach, we have systematically investigated the sensitivity and intensity of PH-induction, as well as its effects on various sensory, behavioral and cognitive aspects. In the present study, we pooled individual-participant data from 26 in-house experiments (totaling 580 individuals) and conducted a Bayesian analysis to estimate effects and moderators of PH-induction. PH-induction was reliably induced with a medium effect-size, and individuals with schizotypal traits were more sensitive.

Multimodal classification approaches integrating neuroimaging and cognitive scores may offer early and accurate characterization and subsequently improved diagnostic precision. Methods: In this study, we included 100 participants (50 AD, 30 FTD, including 14 bvFTD and 16 PPA, and 20 MCI) who underwent simultaneous structural MRI and FDG-PET imaging. Cortical thickness (CTH) from anatomical MRI and standardized uptake values from FDG-PET were extracted using FreeSurfer and PETSurfer pipelines, respectively. CTH and FDG-PET features were combined into a single vector through a logistic weighting function derived from ACE-III scores, capturing the progressive nature of cognitive decline in dementia. A Naive Bayes classifier was then trained to differentiate diagnostic groups based on the merged features. Results: The model achieved classification accuracies of 83% for MCI vs. dementia (AD + FTD), 85% for MCI vs. FTD, 87% for MCI vs. PPA, 71% for MCI vs. bvFTD, 64% for MCI vs. AD, and 69% for AD vs. FTD.

Separate groups of participants (N = 144) were trained on visual detection tasks using either a reactivation-based protocol or conventional full-practice, combined with anodal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the visual cortex. Strikingly, only combination of reactivation-based learning with anodal tDCS produced complete generalization from trained to untrained stimuli, an effect consistently replicated across features (orientation, motion direction). In contrast, reactivation-based learning alone and conventional full-practice, whether with or without brain stimulation, yielded stimulus-specific learning. Importantly, reactivation-coupled brain stimulation achieved generalization with an 80% reduction in training trials while maintaining learning gains comparable to full-practice.

Before and after training, EEG was recorded during a translation recognition task designed to elicit the N400, an index of semantic integration. Vocabulary accuracy increased from 0.41% pre-learning to 75.5% post-learning (dz = 3.96), and the N400 incongruity effect increased significantly, F(1, 75) = 99.52, p < .001, 2g = .32, reflecting successful integration of new L2 words into the mental lexicon. High performers showed larger N400 responses and distinct ERP template-map preponderance (i.e., the proportion of epoch time points assigned to a given template map) indicating more efficient and specialized neural processing. Despite systematic manipulation of learning strategies, no single approach yielded consistent behavioral or neural advantages, suggesting that overall exposure and cumulative practice - rather than any specific strategy - were the key drivers of robust learning. ERP template-map analyses further revealed that learning not only amplified neural responses but also shifted the preponderance of maps in the N400 window, signaling a qualitative reorganization of semantic processing.

However, noninvasive measurement of prefrontal activity remains challenging, limiting our understanding of how to optimize prefrontal treatments. Input-output relationships reveal how neural circuits respond to different inputs and are essential for determining optimal treatment parameters and understanding individual variability in treatment response, yet systematic investigation of prefrontal input-output relationships has been lacking. Objective: To characterize human prefrontal excitability with input-output (I/O) curves. Methods: We employed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography in a randomized mixed-block design with 28 healthy participants receiving single-pulse TMS to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) across 12 stimulation intensities (60-140% of resting motor threshold). We quantified prefrontal excitability using early local TMS-evoked potentials (EL-TEPs), local cortical responses measured locally 20-60 ms post-stimulus. Results: We observed a strong effect of TMS intensity on prefrontal EL-TEPs. Sigmoidal EL-TEP I/O curves were observed in 57% of participants, with the sigmoidality partially explained by the signal quality of the EL-TEP. Correlations were observed between EL-TEP and motor-evoked potential curve parameters, but intensity parameterization approaches did not significantly differ in explaining inter-individual EL-TEP response variability. Reliable EL-TEPs could be obtained using fewer TMS pulses at higher intensities, and test-retest assessments revealed robust I/O curve profiles. Conclusions: These findings provide a systematic noninvasive characterization of prefrontal input-output physiology in humans, establishing a validated framework for estimating prefrontal excitability.

A.; Conrad, E.", "abstract": "Extensive research over the past two decades has focused on identifying a preictal period in scalp as well as intracranial EEG (iEEG). This has led to a plethora of seizure prediction and forecasting algorithms which have reached only moderate success on curated and pre-segmented EEG datasets (accuracy/AUC [&ge;] 0.8). Furthermore, when tested on their ability to pseudo-prospectively predict seizures from continuous EEG recordings, all existing algorithms suffer from low sensitivity (large false negatives), high time in warning (large false positives), or both. In this study, we provide pilot evidence that predictive modeling of the dynamics of iEEG features (biomarkers), seizure risk, or both at the scale of tens of minutes can significantly improve the pseudo-prospective accuracy of almost any state-of-the-art seizure forecasting model. In contrast to the bulk of prior research that has focused on designing better features and classifiers, we start from off-the-shelf features and classifiers and shift the focus to learning how iEEG features (classifier input) and seizure risk (classifier output) evolve over time. Using iEEG from n = 5 patients undergoing presurgical evaluation at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and six state-of-the-art baseline models, we first demonstrate that a wide array of iEEG features are highly predictable over time, with over 99% and 35% of studied features, respectively, having R2 > 0 for 10-second- and 10-minute-ahead prediction (mean R2 of 0.85 and 0.2). Furthermore, in almost all patients and baseline models, we observe a strong correlation between feature predictability (with some features remaining predictable up to 30 minutes) and classification-based feature importance. As a result, we subsequently demonstrate that adding an autoregressive model that predicts iEEG features on 12{+/-}4 minutes into the future is almost universally beneficial, with a mean improvement of 28% in terms of area under pseudo-prospective sensitivity-time in warning curve (PP-AUC). The addition of the second autoregressive predictive model at the level of seizure risk further improved accuracy, with a total mean improvement of 51% in PP-AUC.

Mechanical allodynia, or touch-evoked pain, is a highly prevalent and debilitating symptom of neuropathic pain. It has been proposed that, after nerve injury, innocuous sensory neurons gain access to nociceptive-specific (NS) circuits in the DH due to altered spinal inhibitory controls, thereby converting touch into pain. It is however unclear how sensory processing is reorganized in these conditions across the different laminae of the DH to generate this symptom. In this study, we developed a novel ex vivo somatosensory preparation to selectively analyze excitatory neuronal activity across all DH laminae simultaneously, following physiological stimulations of the skin. Using two-photon calcium (Ca2+) imaging, we studied the DH activity under physiological conditions, after spinal disinhibition or nerve injury, and generated a computational model to reveal the sensory plasticity of individual DH neurons that leads to neuropathic pain. We demonstrate that spinal disinhibition, whether pharmacologically induced or resulting from nerve injury, converts most DH excitatory neurons into highly polymodal cells. We further show that such disinhibition unmasks an unprecedented number of previously silent neurons in both superficial and deep DH laminae, responding to a wide dynamic range (WDR) of sensory modalities. The computational model pinpoints that neuropathic pain does not result primarily from the transformation of excitatory NS neurons into WDR neurons, but rather from the activation of a previously dormant excitatory circuit. This newly active circuit spans both superficial and deep DH laminae and is predominantly composed of WDR excitatory neurons The identification of this extensive silent neuronal network provides critical insights into DH plasticity mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain, and should guide future therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated how humans learn to stabilize a physically unstable, underactuated system, and how participants cope with changes in the system's dynamics. Twelve right-handed adults balanced a real inverted pendulum by moving a cart along a linear rail. Study 1 characterized the passive mechanical properties of three pendulums (short, medium, and long) using free-oscillatory decay and fall to absolute 30 degrees trials, after their release from the upright position. Longer rods exhibited slower decay and lower natural frequencies, as well as a longer duration before falling, indicating greater passive stability. Study 2 assessed human motor control of the pendulum to maintain balance. Human participants trained with the medium pendulum (30 trials) and were then tested with all three pendulums (20 trials each). During training, balance performance improved significantly, with time to failure increasing over trials. During testing, performance scaled with pendulum length, and longer rods were easier to balance. Similar peak cart velocities were observed across conditions, suggesting equivalent actuation effort. Additionally, as expected, pendulum angular velocities decreased with rod length, reflecting underlying inertial differences. Pendulum passive dynamics closely matched behavioral performance, supporting a strong link between intrinsic system properties and balancing outcomes. These findings show that motor learning in physically unstable environments is not only shaped by feedback and effort, but also by the alignment of human control strategies and abilities with the natural dynamics of the plant.

Here, utilizing human postmortem AD brains and a mouse model of tauopathy, we report that genotoxic stress-induced cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) immune pathway form a self-amplifying loop that fuels neuropathology and cognitive deficits. Targeted disruption of this cycle through either genetic deletion of cGAS or pharmacological inhibition of STING restores immune homeostasis and attenuates tau pathology and cognitive deficits. Our results showed a significant accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DDSBs) and impaired DNA repair function, alongside elevated cGAS-STING signaling and type I interferon (IFN-I) responses in human AD brains compared to non-AD. In the PS19 transgenic (PS19Tg) mouse model of tauopathy, we found significantly elevated levels of DDSBs and altered expression of DNA repair proteins during early stages of disease, which preceded the dysregulation of cGAS-STING signaling and emergence of significant neuropathology in the later stage. Interestingly, genetic deletion of cGAS shifted microglial polarization from a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype toward an anti-inflammatory M2 state, accompanied by a reduction in IFN-I signaling and improved cognitive performance in PS19Tg mice. Pharmacological STING inhibition reshaped the transcriptomic landscape, revealing selective regulation of pathways governing synaptic plasticity, and immune responses. This transcriptional reprogramming was accompanied by suppression of inflammatory responses, reduction in synaptic pathology, and attenuation of tau pathology in PS19Tg mice, underscoring STING as a therapeutic target for tauopathy. In conclusion, our findings reveal that genotoxic-immune crosstalk drives neuroinflammation and tau pathology and identify a conserved, druggable cGAS-STING axis that can be targeted to impede or slow disease progression in tauopathies.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Our findings reveal age-related shifts in these model parameters: older individuals exhibit stronger global coupling and more positive values of the bifurcation parameter, consistent with a transition to a supercritical regime.

E.", "abstract": "Movement during MRI scanning complicates distinguishing between the different tissues in the brain (e.g., grey and white matter). Standard practice excludes scans based on researcher-determined visual quality thresholds. Unfortunately, children, elderly, and clinical populations are shown to move more, resulting in higher exclusion rates. This disproportionate exclusion creates systematic bias in the literature and makes research findings less generalizable. Furthermore, the artifacts caused by motion are demonstrated to continue to confound data, even after visual quality control has occurred. We aimed to minimize the confounding factor of systematic group differences in movement. To achieve this, we used a post-scanning statistical technique called propensity score matching (PSM) that matches control and patient populations on scan quality metrics, leading to more comparable groups, greater inclusion, and more generalizable results. We found that PSM can attenuate significant differences in scan quality between groups while allowing for greater sample diversity than standard exclusion protocols. Crucially, using PSM can also alter the results of neuroimaging-based analyses. Using three datasets (total n = 1536), we compared voxel based morphometry analyses based on different quality control protocols. In particular, we observed discrepant results between PSM and strict threshold exclusion, with PSM magnifying some regional group differences and diminishing others.

Male Sprague Dawley rats were classified as having high or low sensitivity to the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole, and a subset was tested with the D1 receptor agonist SKF 82958. Cue-reactivity was assessed using a Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA) task, which distinguishes between sign-tracking (approach to a cue that predicts reward) and goal-tracking (approach to the site of reward delivery). Cocaine sensitivity was measured by locomotor activity and 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), a putative measure of appetitive states. High D2 responders exhibited more sign-tracking and greater cocaine-induced USVs than low responders despite no difference in cocaine-induced locomotion. Sign-trackers also showed greater locomotor sensitivity to D1 receptor stimulation than goal-trackers and produced more cocaine-induced USVs. Rats with high sensitivity to both D1 and D2 receptor stimulation showed the strongest sign-tracking behavior and affective response to cocaine. These findings suggest that dopamine receptor sensitivity is associated with the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues and potentially the appetitive effects of cocaine.

We conclude that voltage imaging analyses needs to be tailored to different experimental settings: we propose a decision-tree to determine analysis strategies for diverse experimental conditions. Together, these insights pave the way for reproducible, high-fidelity voltage imaging studies.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is an important tool in assessing white matter connectivity and brain tissue microstructure across different populations. Whole brain white matter analysis using dMRI tractography for group statistical comparison is a challenging task due to the large number of white matter connections. In this work, we study whole-brain white matter connectivity differences between females and males using dMRI tractography. We study a large cohort of 707 healthy adult subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. By applying a well-established fiber clustering pipeline and a suprathreshold fiber cluster statistical method, we evaluated tracts in the cerebral cortex, as well as those connecting to regions such as the cerebellum, which have been relatively less studied using dMRI tractography. We identified several tracts that differed significantly between females and males in terms of their fractional anisotropy and/or mean diffusivity. These included several deep white matter tracts (e.g., arcuate fasciculus, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum) that have been previously shown to have sex differences, as well as superficial white matter tracts in the frontal lobe. However, there were relatively few cortical association tracts that exhibited significant sex differences. We also identified cerebellar tracts with sex differences. Finally, correlation analysis revealed that these white matter differences were linked to a range of neurobehavioral measures, with the strongest and most consistent associations observed for motor function. Overall, these findings provide characterizations of sex differences in the white matter and indicate that the circuits underlying motor function may be an important focus of future work on sex differences in the human brain.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Perivascular spaces (PVS), key for brain waste clearance, may play a role in the neurotoxicity of air pollution. This study explored associations between air pollution exposure, PVS morphology, and cognition in preadolescents. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study data from 6,949 9-10-year-old participants. Annual average exposures to PM2.5, O3, NO2, and 15 PM2.5 components were estimated using spatiotemporal models mapped to residential addresses. PVS count and volume were derived from T1w and T2w MRI, and cognition was estimated using NIH Toolbox scores. Linear mixed-effects models examined independent associations between air pollution, PVS, and cognition; weighted quantile sum regression assessed co-exposure effects of PM2.5 mixtures. Findings: Linear models revealed that exposures to Zn, NH4+, and Br were positively associated with PVS count in several regions. Higher PVS count in five key regions was associated with poorer cognitive performance across several NIH Toolbox domains. Higher Ca, Zn, and NH4+ exposures were associated with poorer cognition (PFDR < 0.01). Higher frontal lobe PVS count mediated the association between Zn exposure and poorer total cognition (P < 0.01). Co-exposure models revealed that PM2.5 mixtures were associated with higher temporal and cingulate PVS count, and poorer working memory and crystallized intelligence (P < 0.01). Interpretation: Outdoor air pollution was associated with higher PVS count and reduced cognition, suggesting that brain clearance may be a novel mechanism linking pollution to neurodevelopmental harm in preadolescents.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

However, the functional brain network mechanisms supporting motor and cognitive aspects of dual task performance in aging remain unclear. We examined 40 older adults (50 to 80 years) and 20 younger adults (20 to 40 years) who performed a motor single task (pedaling), a cognitive single-task (Go/NoGo), and a combined cognitive motor dual task during functional magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) using a custom-built MRI compatible pedaling device. Behaviorally, older adults showed significant dual task costs in motor performance, while cognitive performance was preserved. Neurally, older adults showed selective increases in connectivity within executive and motor-planning regions of cognitive networks, consistent with compensatory recruitment, whereas motor networks underwent broader reorganization, with strengthened frontoparietal control circuits but weakened cerebello-parietal and sensorimotor pathways. Multivariate analyses further revealed age related differences in latent connectivity behavior relationships: motor network patterns in older adults were more dispersed, reflecting heterogeneous reorganization, whereas cognitive-network patterns were more overlapping across groups, suggesting relative preservation. These findings suggest that aging involves a domain specific balance of resilience and vulnerability across brain networks and highlight motor-network adaption as a promising target for understanding why some older adults maintain function while others decline.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Cell-cell interactions, which are largely mediated by cell-surface proteins, control many critical aspects of development and physiology; as such, dysregulation of glial cell-surface proteins in particular is hypothesized to play an important role in age-related neurodegeneration. However, it remains technically difficult to profile glial cell-surface proteins in intact brains. Here, we applied a cell-surface proteomic profiling method to glial cells from intact brains in Drosophila, which enabled us to fully profile cell-surface proteomes in-situ, preserving native cell-cell interactions that would otherwise be omitted using traditional proteomics methods. Applying this platform to young and old flies, we investigated how glial cell-surface proteomes change during aging. We identified candidate genes predicted to be involved in brain aging, including several associated with neural development and synapse wiring molecules not previously thought to be particularly active in glia. Through a functional genetic screen, we identified one surface protein, DIP-{beta}, which is down-regulated in old flies and can increase fly lifespan when overexpressed in adult glial cells. We further performed whole-head single-nucleus RNA-seq, and revealed that DIP-{beta} overexpression mainly impacts glial and fat cells. We also found that glial DIP-{beta} overexpression was associated with improved cell-cell communication, which may contribute to the observed lifespan extension. Our study is the first to apply in-situ cell-surface proteomics to glial cells in Drosophila, and to identify DIP-{beta} as a potential glial regulator of brain aging.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Although not as prominent as in other animals, also humans experience seasonal variations in for example sleep duration and circadian processes. These variations are likely driven by changes in photoperiod length. Anecdotally, a relevant number of people report experiencing fatigue and low energy levels particularly during spring. However, scientific evidence for seasonal variations in fatigue and daytime sleepiness is largely missing. We thus investigated temporal variations in fatigue, daytime sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, and sleep quality through an online survey including repeated (i.e., every six weeks) assessments of the same individuals over the course of one year. We hypothesised that fatigue and daytime sleepiness would be higher during shorter photoperiods. We further expected lower sleep quality and more severe insomnia symptoms under shorter photoperiods. Additionally, we explored variations with photoperiod change, across months, and seasons. Hypotheses were tested using Bayesian linear mixed-effects models. The study and analyses were pre-registered. Between April 2024 and September 2025, 418 adults (80% women) completed at least two assessments. Nearly half of participants (47%) reported experiencing spring fatigue. However, repeated assessments across one year showed no evidence for seasonal or monthly variations in fatigue, sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, or sleep quality. Fatigue during day-to-day activities decreased with longer photoperiods but was independent of photoperiod change. Overall, the results provide evidence against spring fatigue as a genuine seasonal phenomenon. The discrepancy between high self-reports of the phenomenon and stable longitudinal patterns suggests that spring fatigue may reflect cultural labelling and result from cognitive-perceptual biases rather than reflecting a genuine seasonal syndrome.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

However, the proximate mechanism of Darwinian fitness signaled through music has not. As popular music and dance functionally aim to hold an observers attention, we investigate features in various sounds that might stimulate attentive behavior in an audience. We propose a calculus of attention to moving objects and sound to ascertain their f(x) = location = positional control, 1st derivative f(x) = energy = change in position, and 2nd derivative f(x) = surprise = change in direction. We developed statistical software to (A) analyze nine features of sound related to acoustic control, energy, and surprise (CES), (B) map dynamic song trajectories within the multivariate space of CES, and (C) measure how stable performances are within this space (i.e. signaling fitness). When musical sounds are compared to animal vocalizations, human speech, and non-biological sounds including noise, we statistically confirm that music maintains the highest stability in the space of CES. This fitness signal related to attention varies across musical genres and is also detected animal calls as well. Attention signaling also differs significantly between experts versus novice musicians, adult versus immature bird songs, and is constrained by musical performance interactions with live audiences as well. We conclude that audiovisual signaling via this calculus of attention to behavioral display reflects the physics of observing bodies in motion, probably originating from selective pressure of intra/interspecific conflicts formed at the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, and retained in modern music today.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

DLC2Action integrates multiple state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, optimized for action segmentation and supports self-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage unlabeled data, boosting performance with limited labeled datasets. Its robust implementation enables efficient hyperparameter optimization, customizable feature extraction, and data handling. We also standardized eight benchmarks and evaluated DLC2Action on five animal behavior datasets, which comprise common behavioral tests in neuroscience, and four human datasets. Overall these datasets span a wide range of contexts from standard laboratory studies to naturalistic cooking. DLC2Action reached strong performance across those benchmarks. To further showcase the tool's versatility, we applied it to Atari gameplay data and found that in certain games the players' eye movements consistently predict their button presses across different subjects. Furthermore, DLC2Action features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for streamlined behavior annotation, active learning, and assessment of model predictions.

However, multicolor approaches are spectrally limited in diversity, whereas nucleic acid barcoding lacks a cell-filling morphology signal for segmentation. Here, we introduce PRISM (Protein-barcode Reconstruction via Iterative Staining with Molecular annotations), a platform that integrates combinatorial delivery of antigenically distinct, cell-filling proteins with tissue expansion, multi-cycle imaging, barcode-augmented reconstruction, and molecular annotation. Protein barcodes increase label diversity by >750-fold over multicolor labeling and enable morphology reconstruction with intrinsic error correction. We acquired a [~]10 million m3 volume of mouse hippocampal area CA2/3, multiplexed across 23 barcode antigen and synaptic marker channels. By combining barcodes with shape information we achieve an 8x increase in automatic tracing accuracy of genetically labelled neurons. We demonstrate PRISM supports automatic proofreading across micron-scale spatial gaps and reconnects neurites across discontinuities spanning hundreds of microns. Using PRISM's molecular annotation capability, we map the distribution of synapses onto traced neural morphology, characterizing challenging synaptic structures such as thorny excrescences (TEs), and discovering a size correlation among spatially proximal TEs on the same dendrite.

This work challenges the traditional view that DNA damage is inherently harmful, demonstrating that minor, reversible DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) induced by exercise serve as necessary primers for memory consolidation - a mechanism that may be impaired in AD pathogenesis. AD affects 1 in 9 adults over 65, with ~95% being late-onset cases where up to 40% of risk factors are modifiable through lifestyle interventions like exercise. While exercise demonstrably lowers AD risk, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study provides a missing mechanistic link by showing how exercise-induced DNA damage repair systems could counteract the DNA damage accumulation and repair dysregulation that are established hallmarks of brain aging and AD. In data presented herein, young mice showed significantly higher SSB rates in active genomic regions compared to aged mice, suggesting the decline of a protective mechanism (i.e., hormesis) with aging - potentially explaining increased AD susceptibility in older adults. The present study also suggests that exercise-induced SSBs are not random cellular damage but precisely targeted events that occur at genes essential for neuroplasticity, synaptic function, and memory formation. These breaks activate PARP1 (Poly ADP ribose polymerase 1), a crucial DNA damage sensor that simultaneously initiates repair processes while facilitating transcriptional programs necessary for memory consolidation. This mechanism may represent how exercise \"primes\" the brain against the pathological DNA damage accumulation seen in AD. In support of this, in behavioral experiments, a single exercise bout converted sub-threshold learning into robust long-term memory formation. This memory enhancement correlated with upregulation of both neurotrophic genes (BDNF, Fos) and DNA repair enzymes (PARP1, PARP2), demonstrating coordinated damage-repair processes that appear compromised in AD. We identify HPF1 as a critical cofactor enabling PARP1 to perform trans-ADP-ribosylation of histones, linking DNA damage sensing to epigenetic chromatin remodeling required for memory-related gene expression. This pathway represents a novel therapeutic target for AD, as restoring efficient DNA repair mechanisms might slow or prevent memory loss.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

A central question in systems neuroscience is how motor systems adapt to repeated sensory events without compromising responsiveness. We investigated this adaptive capacity using saccadic inhibition (SI), a reflexive suppression of eye movements triggered by sudden visual transients, as a probe of oculomotor dynamics during naturalistic viewing. Human participants (N = 21) freely explored visual arrays while brief gaze-contingent flashes appeared five times at random intervals, either foveally or parafoveally. SI reliably occurred ~120 ms post-flash across repetitions and locations, indicating robust sensory-driven inhibition. However, the rebound phase, reflecting saccade reprogramming, showed a progressive decline. In a second experiment (N = 19), only the first or the fifth flash was visible on each trial. In this case, neither inhibition nor rebound was altered, suggesting that the rebound decline is driven by repeated sensory stimulation rather than exploration time. This dissociation reveals selective habituation of motor re-engagement mechanisms, while reflexive inhibitory gating remains stable. We propose that inhibition is mediated by circuitry that transiently suppresses saccade initiation and resists habituation. By contrast, the weakening rebound reflects a separate, habituation-prone route that reduces saccade generation to irrelevant events. Functionally, this imbalance implies a recalibration within the saccade generator, preserving inhibitory capacity while constraining motor output. Our findings uncover a distinct form of oculomotor habituation and demonstrate how SI reveals dynamic decoupling of sensory input and motor output under repeated stimulation.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Specifically, in murine models, spatial learning and cognitive flexibility have been identified as critical components of mothering. These abilities facilitate efficient navigation of the environment, resource acquisition, and responsiveness to offspring's needs. While cognitive enhancements during the postpartum period have been observed in various experimental setups, research using long-term data collection with automated monitoring in home cage setup is completely lacking even though it provides a more reliable approach than other experimental procedures. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by systematically examining spatial learning and cognitive flexibility in female mice during the reproductive stages using IntelliCage, with the objective of offering a more comprehensive understanding of maternal cognitive adaptations. Utilising the IntelliCage system, we observed that female mice in the postpartum phase outperformed pregnant and nulliparous females in place learning, reversal learning, and fixed schedule drinking tasks, demonstrating faster adaptation and superior retention of information. These paradigms mirror real-world challenges faced by mothers, such as navigating resources and balancing caregiving with self-maintenance. The enhanced performance demonstrated by the mothers could be attributed to their heightened motivation and cognitive abilities, potentially influenced by substantial hormonal shifts, which have been known to modify neuroplasticity in critical brain regions. The identification of these improvements in maternal behaviour may offer novel insights into the impact of reproductive experiences on brain function, with implications for maternal health and broader cognitive research.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify Proline-Rich Transmembrane Protein 2 (PRRT2) as a native regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation. We show that PRRT2 facilitates the entry of Nav channels into slow-inactivated state and delays their recovery, a regulatory effect conserved from zebrafish to humans. PRRT2 forms molecular complexes with Nav channels both in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse cortex, PRRT2 deficiency impairs the slow inactivation of Nav channels in neuronal axons, leading to reduced cortical resilience in response to hyperexcitable challenges.

However, the relative contribution and role of these slow inward and fast outward currents in ADP generation is poorly understood in the context of somatic and dendritic localization as well as with varied dendritic properties. Using a two compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley type model, the role of somatic and dendritic compartmentalization of ADP associated currents is investigated, revealing that dendritic (rather than somatic) slow inward and fast outward currents are the main contributors to ADP and spike-adding during both brief step current and AMPA current input. Additionally, dendritic size and passive properties of the dendrites were found to be key modulators of ADP amplitude. However, increasing magnitudes of NMDA current conductance resulted in nonmonotonic spike-adding in a manner dependent on dendritic Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ activated K+ currents, which was found to be the result of tight regulation of stimulus evoked transient bursting through positive feedback on action potential generation by dendritic Ca2+ and subsequent negative feedback through Ca2+ activated K+ currents.

Results: We show that heterozygous LRRK2 mutations dysregulate cellular iron across iPSCs, neurons and astrocytes, in a kinase-dependent manner. Lysosomal ferrous iron storage was consistently elevated across iPSCs, iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes carrying LRRK2 mutations. LRRK2 regulates Rab GTPase function through their direct phosphorylation, and our prior work revealed significant but divergent lysosomal phenotypes between Rab8a and Rab10 knockout models. Here, we report that Rab8a knockout recapitulates key aspects of LRRK2 mutation phenotypes on intracellular iron and ferritin levels, although with differences in magnitude and specificity. By contrast, Rab10 deficiency showed opposing effects, suggesting distinct roles for these well-established LRRK2 substrates in iron homeostasis. Finally, we show that basal lipid peroxidation and ROS levels are elevated in isogenic LRRK2 mutant neurons, while iron chelation was sufficient to reduce LRRK2-dependent ROS. Conclusions: Together, our findings demonstrate that LRRK2 mutations disrupt iron homeostasis across disease-relevant cell types and establish a discrete biochemical pathway linking LRRK2 signaling and vulnerability to ferroptosis. Ongoing work aims to further dissect the roles of Rab substrates in these pathways.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

W.; Lee, S.-K.", "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by disruptions in brain development, resulting in cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments. FOXG1 syndrome (FS), caused by heterozygous mutations in the FOXG1 gene, exemplifies a severe monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder. To investigate its pathogenesis, we generated a patient-specific W300X mouse model carrying a truncation variant of FOXG1. We found that the truncated FOXG1 protein in W300X-heterozygous (W300X-Het) mice is more abundant and more nuclear-localized than the full-length FOXG1 protein, implicating a pathogenic mechanism involving the truncated protein. Interestingly, W300X-Het mice exhibited profound abnormalities in the dentate gyrus, including disrupted neurogenesis, impaired granule cell migration, and altered dendritic morphology. Transcriptomic profiling identified broad dysregulation in protein homeostasis pathways, particularly ribosomal biogenesis, translation, and proteostasis. Disruption of the FOXG1-MYCN pathway, critical for robust protein synthesis during neural stem cell division, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, emerged as a key mechanism underlying these defects. In parallel, microglial activation and inflammation were markedly increased in the dentate gyrus, contributing to a pro-inflammatory environment that exacerbates neurogenic and structural deficits. Consistent with hippocampal dysfunction in FS patients, W300X-Het mice exhibited significant spatial learning and memory impairments. Together, our study highlights disrupted protein homeostasis and neuroinflammation as key drivers of FS pathogenesis, providing a framework for developing therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Animal model studies have been invaluable for demonstrating the importance of the DRG nociceptor in pain sensation and the development of related analgesic targets. However, there are functional biological differences between human and animal model nociceptors. Therefore, a complementary in vitro model of human nociception is critical to confirming the relevance of preclinical findings for therapeutic drug development. We characterized the nociceptive properties of differentiated cells from the human DRG-derived immortalized cell line HD10.6. Within differentiated HD10.6 cells, we documented the abundance and localization of nociceptive machinery central to regulating excitability and linked with pain sensation including ion channels TRPV1 and NaV1.7 and afferent peptides CGRP and Substance P. Using calcium influx imaging assays, we confirmed the electrical functionality of TRPV1 and NaV1.7 in HD10.6 cells, and through whole-cell patch clamp, we found similar baseline electrophysiological parameters of HD10.6 cells to those previously observed in human patient DRGs. Further, we found that differentiated HD10.6 cells express the mu opioid receptor 1 protein, and DAMGO, a mu agonist, blocks depolarization-evoked calcium influx in a naloxone-reversible fashion. Importantly, using an inflammatory cocktail, excitation and peripheral sensitization are induced within HD10.6 cells, mirroring nociceptors in a pain state during or after tissue damage or inflammation. Finally, HD10.6 cells were also cultured into dual-chambered microfluidic devices to mirror the biological anatomy of the nociceptor. Within this system, we demonstrated the uptake of adeno-associated-virus (AAV) by the peripheral terminals and AAV transport to the soma. Altogether, we have developed the use of HD10.6 cells to create a system of human nociceptive signaling on a chip to study human nociceptor physiology and intervention.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

We identified a secondary proliferative zone in the ventral subventricular zone and spatiotemporal-context dependent Notch pathway repression by DLX2 in maintaining progenitor populations and facilitating neural differentiation. We found that DLX2 controls cell fate determination by directly repressing Notch signalling genes as well as glial fate promoting transcription factors, thereby inhibiting early adoption of oligodendroglial differentiation during neurogenesis.

In many species, a substantial proportion of RGCs are eliminated by programmed cell death during development to regulate their final number, but how cell death impacts human RGC development remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the timing and cell-type-specificity of cell death in human fetal retinas and retinal organoids. Both retinas and organoids exhibited two waves of apoptosis: an early wave targeting neurogenic retinal progenitor cells and neuronal precursors, and a late wave affecting RGCs and other neurons. Additionally, organoids displayed a distinct wave of necrosis. To investigate how the apoptotic waves affect retinal development, we differentiated human BAX/BAK double mutant organoids deficient in apoptosis. In these mutants, RGC lifespan and survival increased, while RGC neurogenesis and maturation were delayed. Thus, developmental apoptosis controls not only the quantity of RGCs but also their developmental dynamics. Together, our results highlight the roles of apoptosis in human RGC development and the challenges in retinal organoid design.

In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models.

For instance, information may be represented relatively more strongly in visual cortex when a WM task requires fine visual detail, or more strongly in motor cortex when a specific response can be prepared. If WM is geared to prospectively guide actions, then we might also expect such task-oriented neural signals to propagate to the peripheral sensors and effectors that realize WM goals. Likewise, there is now evidence that oculomotor signals like saccade biases can track simple visuo-spatial WM features. However, it is unclear if such signatures are functionally meaningful, and how much information is contained in them. Here, we test the idea that WM content is adaptively distributed across the nervous system according to behavioral demands. Namely, we test whether visual WM stimulus features are expressed in patterns of both eye and hand movements during a WM delay, and whether the distribution of such peripheral motor activity shifts with the task context. In a delayed recall task, we manipulated how human participants reported their memory by having them either draw a line or adjust a wheel to match a remembered orientation. Via eye- and stylus-tracking, we found that remembered orientations were decodable from small inflections in both gaze and hand movements during the blank WM delay. Moreover, this decoding strength varied by response format: gaze patterns tracked memorized features relatively better in the wheel condition (vs. draw), while hand movements were better in the draw condition (vs. wheel). Individuals who showed greater wheel benefits in gaze-based decoding also showed greater draw benefits in hand-based decoding, suggesting a strategic processing shift to the more relevant system. Therefore, visually encoded WM contents may be adaptively allocated to the most task-relevant motor effectors, balancing WM representations across peripheral activity according to behavioral needs.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

The most specific autoantibody response in SLE, present in 20-30% of patients, targets the Sm-protein and has been shown to recognize a linear Sm-derived B cell epitope containing a post-translational modification (PTM) of arginine termed symmetrical dimethyl arginine (sDMA). As autoantibodies to other PTM-modified proteins are often promiscuous, we aimed to determine the specificity and cross-reactivity of anti-Sm antibodies. Methods Specificity and promiscuity/cross-reactivity of anti-Sm IgG were measured by ELISA in anti-Sm+ SLE patients (n=12), anti-Sm- SLE patients (n=12) and healthy donors (HD) (n=12) using peptides containing either sDMA or unmodified arginine. Inhibition and cross-reactivity were determined using competitive ELISA and affinity purification. Recognition of endogenous EBNA1 by anti-Sm IgG was performed by Western blot using lysates of EBV-bearing lymphoblastoid cell lines. Results The sDMA residue is recognized by anti-Sm+ SLE patients regardless of the peptide amino acid sequence, with a modest impact of amino acids flanking sDMA on recognition. Most notably, IgGs targeting sDMA comprise the overall majority (~90%) of the anti-Sm antibody repertoire and are highly cross-reactive between SmD3108-122 and several sDMA-containing viral-derived epitopes, including full-length EBNA1. Conclusion Our data implicate that the majority of anti-Sm IgGs target the sDMA residue irrespective of its Sm-context, thus representing a prototypic anti-modified protein antibody (AMPA) response.

Nutrient limitations can be dynamic in nature, requiring ongoing regulatory adjustments involving new protein synthesis despite total biosynthetic activities being dramatically lower than during growth. Here, we have characterized the responses of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa to prolonged starvation for carbon or nitrogen sources, and to transitions between these states. We find that most cells survive both types of starvation for more than a week and maintain low but robustly detectable levels of protein synthesis in the absence of growth. Nitrogen-starved cells are larger, make more proteins and retain fewer ribosomes than carbon-starved cells, indicating that distinct physiological strategies are adopted during the two starvation types. We found that the newly synthesized proteomes of each starvation type are distinct, although many of the most highly synthesized proteins are shared between both conditions. Interestingly, we observed a temporary burst of protein synthesis as cells were transitioned between the two starvation conditions, which may reflect active remodelling of the proteome during growth arrest. We also used transposon insertion sequencing to identify genes impacting fitness in both starvation conditions and during transitions between the two and found that a highly overlapping set of global regulators most strongly influenced survival.

Mechanistically, DOX first induces p38-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), providing a transient brake on cell death. PPP1R3G facilitates the removal of inhibitory phosphorylation, thereby permitting RIPK1 activation, oligomerization, and downstream apoptotic signaling. Activated RIPK1 further promotes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release, which induces IFN-{beta}-mediated ZBP1 expression and establishes a positive feedback loop that amplifies late-stage necroptosis. Genetic ablation of Ppp1r3g suppresses both apoptosis and necroptosis in cardiomyocytes, attenuates inflammatory cytokine production, and protects mice from DOX-induced cardiac injury and mortality.

MRAP2 modifies signaling of three distinct GPCRs, melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), MC3R and the ghrelin receptor (GHSR), which each play essential roles in appetite regulation. Human mutations in MRAP2 cause obesity with hyperglycaemia and hypertension, suggesting that its regulation of GPCRs is critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. However, the nature of MRAP2/GPCR complexes and whether there are shared mechanisms for complex assembly, critical structural regions or consistent effects on receptor signaling and trafficking remains unknown. Here we showed all three GPCRs preferentially interact with MRAP2 as 1:1 complexes and that MRAP2 binding disrupts GPCR homodimerization. MRAP2 interacts with the same receptor transmembrane regions to promote GPCR signaling, and the accessory protein impairs {beta}-arrestin-2 recruitment to prolong signaling and delay internalization. Deletion of the cytoplasmic region of MRAP2 impairs GPCR signaling by modulating receptor constitutive activity.

PM PS content is controlled by lipid transport proteins ORP5 and ORP8, which operate at ER-PM membrane contact sites (MCSs). Using high-resolution imaging, we now show that GSLs including GM3 and SM4, are required to maintain ORP5 and ORP8 localization to MCSs. Genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of enzymes required for the biosynthesis of GM3 or SM4, displace PI4-kinase Type IIIalpha; (PI4KIIIalpha; and its adaptor EFR3A from the PM, thereby reducing PM phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) content. PM interactions of ORP5 and ORP8 are also disrupted. Since ORP5 and ORP8 transport PS to the PM by counter-transporting PI4P to the ER, PM PS content is substantially reduced. We further show that GM3 and GM2 regulate the assembly of ER-PM-MCSs, such that the function of other MCS-localized macromolecular machineries including calcium release-activated calcium channels is abrogated when glycosphingolipid biosynthesis is blocked. Together, this study establishes glycosphingolipids as organizers of PS transport and ER-PM MCSs, expanding the regulators of MCSs beyond protein tethers to include glycosylated lipids and revealing how glycosphingolipids control KRAS function.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "New Orleans, Louisiana, is a major gateway for the introduction of arboviruses into the United States due to high volumes of travel from arbovirus-endemic regions, the influx of migratory birds, and the presence of competent mosquito vectors. To respond to this increasing threat, the New Orleans Mosquito, Termite, and Rodent Control Board conducts routine and response-based mosquito surveillance. Three main types of traps are used in their surveillance system: gravid traps, CDC light traps, and BG-Sentinel traps. Understanding the capability of different trap types in assessing species richness, abundance, and community composition is instrumental in guiding surveillance efforts and responding to travel-associated and locally acquired arboviral infections effectively. This study aims to characterize the temporal dynamics of mosquito vector species in New Orleans, Louisiana, and to evaluate the effectiveness of BG-Sentinel, CDC light, and gravid traps in assessing species richness, abundance, and community composition. Alpha and beta diversity were compared based on trap type. Abundance, Richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and evenness were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test, followed by a post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni correction. Community composition was assessed using pairwise permutational multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA) and similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER), both with 10,000 permutations. Significant differences in mosquito abundance and diversity metrics were observed among trap types, indicating that trap choice strongly influences observed mosquito abundance, richness, community composition, and evenness. Gravid and CDC light traps, as well as BG-Sentinel and gravid traps, collected significantly different communities, driven mostly by higher Culex quinquefasciatus abundance in gravid traps. Differences between BG-Sentinel and CDC light traps were primarily driven by Culex salinarius and Aedes vexans, both more frequently collected by CDC light traps. Our results show that trap type significantly influences estimates of species abundance, richness, community composition, and evenness in New Orleans. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate trap types to generate accurate and actionable surveillance data, essential for guiding and optimizing mosquito control strategies aimed at preventing and responding to arbovirus outbreaks.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a metric that quantifies how selection biases the spectrum of observed mutations in driver genes, and use it to develop a method estimating the number of driver mutations and their effect distribution at individual genes. Applying this framework to large cancer cohorts, we find that in most oncogenes, nearly all driver mutations have already been observed, whereas in most tumor-suppressor genes, the majority remain undiscovered.

The impact of heat stress on this mRNA turnover remains unclear. In heat-shocked yeast cells, the proportion of monosomes within the ribosomal assemblies rises without a corresponding increase in the number of mRNAs associated with them. As a result, most monosomes are devoid of mRNAs and silent, lacking translational initiation factors and proteins facilitating posttranslational folding. The accumulation of silent ribosomes generally reduces the rate of association of transcripts with the ribosomes. However, elevated temperatures enhance the ribosomal association of specific mRNAs, primarily those encoding heat-shock proteins, allowing them to balance their increased degradation rates. Additionally, reduced binding of the Xrn1 exonuclease to mRNAs diminishes the influence of codon optimality on mRNA stability. These mechanisms reorganize mRNA turnover to prioritize heat-shock protein synthesis over ribosome biogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

One way to address this challenge is via computational genotype-to-phenotype models that determine how particular sequence features correlate with protein expression levels. The potential of such approaches is yet to be fully realised, at least partly because so few expression datasets are available. Here, we study the sequence-to-expression relationships of a library of 12,248 membrane proteins derived from combinatorial computational design. The expression phenotype of the entire library is assessed in the widely-used recombinant host Escherichia coli. We employed selected phenotypic data to train a sequence-to-expression predictor using supervised machine learning, which achieved high classification accuracy on held-out test sequences. This model was then used to infer the expression of >10,000 unmeasured sequences, and validation of the top predictions of both high and low expressers achieved 100% success rate. Using tools from explainable AI, we identified specific sequence positions and substitutions that are most important in dictating cellular expression levels. This analysis was validated by model-guided protein engineering that achieved an 8-fold increase in the purification yield of a poorly-expressing variant. We find that cells accumulate elevated levels of transcript mRNA for high-expressing proteins, and speculate that this arises from efficient translation-coupled membrane insertion which minimises transcript degradation. Our results show that computational protein design in tandem with supervised learning leads to effective models for the discovery of protein variants with improved expression phenotypes, and can decode the molecular basis of membrane protein expression.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Oral diseases represent a significant public health challenge, particularly periodontal and peri implant diseases that result in considerable bone loss and diminished quality of life. To address these issues, tissue engineering techniques such as guided bone regeneration (GBR) utilize barrier membranes to promote bone defect healing. This study introduces a novel membrane employing Ganoderma sessile mycelium as a microstructural director for osteogenic biomaterials, achieving a mycelium, alginate, nanohydroxyapatite (My ALG HA) composite. This innovative strategy addresses the limitations of conventional biomaterials, including inadequate management of chewing forces, limited blood supply and microbial contamination. This approach uses the unique hierarchical structure and hydrophobic properties of Ganoderma mycelium alongside the biocompatibility and hydrophilicity of the ALG HA system to improve the structural integrity and biological functionality. The mycelium colonizes the ALG HA substrate, forming a porous trabecular bone like network. Water contact angle assays indicated an anisotropic water interaction behavior, and tensile testing confirmed the material ductility. Incorporating mycelium derived molecules contributes to its hydrophobicity and resistance to degradation in simulated physiological conditions.

Using cryo-EM structures, we modeled open and inactivated conformations of these channels with Rosetta and AlphaFold. We then applied Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS), a physics-based pre-computed ensemble docking method, to predict drug binding affinities. SILCS leverages molecular simulation-generated free energy maps for high-throughput docking against hydrated lipid bilayer-embedded ion channel models. Bayesian machine learning was used to refine SILCS scoring using experimental IC50 values from 69 known hERG blockers outperforming Schrodinger Glide, AutoDock Vina, and OpenEye FRED drug docking predictions. Computed drug binding affinities for hERG and CaV1.2 channels were used to train machine learning models that successfully classified around 300 drugs from the CredibleMeds database.

This investigation concentrated on sows 18 days post-mating, with the objective of identifying biomarkers pertinent to early pregnancy diagnosis through the analysis of variations in metabolic molecules within vaginal secretions. Methods: Vaginal secretion samples were procured from both pregnant and non-pregnant sows 18 days post-mating, subsequently subjected to untargeted metabolomic analysis utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The samples were partitioned into training and testing datasets, and machine learning algorithms--specifically, Random Forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM)--were integrated with metabolite weight ranking to identify key biological markers. Results: A total of 3,249 metabolic molecules were identified, among which 534 exhibited significant differential expression in the vaginal secretions of pregnant versus non-pregnant sows. Notably, three hormones that correlate with the pregnant status of the sow were discerned: Progesterone, 3-Deoxyestradiol, and Prostaglandin E1. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed metabolites were predominantly enriched in nucleotide metabolic pathways. The RF model demonstrated an impressive accuracy of 1.00 in the training dataset and 0.88 in the testing dataset, while the SVM model maintained an accuracy of 1.00 across both datasets.

Here, we show that the nsP3 opal stop codon confers a replicative advantage to Sindbis virus (SINV) in RNAi-competent mosquito cells, but not in cells lacking RNAi. Through delays in nsP processing, the lack of opal stop codon disrupts viral replication spherule integrity and increases Dicer 2-dependent cleavage of viral RNA, resulting in higher antiviral siRNA responses to the virus.

Although numerous cis-elements and trans-factors governing AS have been characterized in animals, their functional roles in plants remain largely unexplored. We previously identified the Arabidopsis sot5 mutant, which exhibits leaf virescence due to a mutation in the conserved 5' splice site (5'ss) of intron 7. Here, through characterization of a suppressor of sot5 (E61), we found that E61 harbors a G to A mutation in exon 8 of the SOT5 gene. Interestingly, this mutation creates a synonymous codon but disrupts the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) motif (AAGAAGA), thereby reducing the splicing efficiency of the adjacent intron 7. Retention of this intron produces a functional protein that rescues the sot5 virescent phenotype. We confirmed the causal role of this ESE by using a cytidine base editor (CBE) to convert the ESE sequence to AAGAAAA or AAAAAAA in sot5. The edited plants phenocopied the suppressor E61. Genetic analyses revealed that mutations of SR45 encoding an RNA-binding protein but not its paralog SR45a similarly rescues the sot5 phenotype by impairing intron 7 splicing. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SR45 directly binds to the ESE motif in vitro, and that mutating the proximal ESEs in intron 2 of another SR45 target, GPDHC1 (Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase C1), recapitulates the splicing defect observed in the sr45 mutant. These findings establish that SR45 specifically recognizes AAG-repeat ESEs to enhance the splicing of adjacent weak introns, revealing a potent strategy for fine-tuning gene expression through targeted editing of splicing regulatory elements for crop improvement.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Homeostatic interactions between injured kidney epithelium and its surrounding milieu determine successful repair outcomes, while pathogenic signaling promotes unresolved inflammation and fibrosis leading to chronic disease. We integrated multiple single-cell and spatial modalities across ~700 samples from >350 patients (~250 research biopsies), analyzing ~1.7 million cells alongside complementary mouse multi-omic profiles spanning acute-to-chronic injury and aging (>300,000 cells) and spatial transcriptomic analysis of >150 human biopsies. This cross-species atlas delineates functional pathways and druggable targets across the nephron and defines gene regulatory networks and chromatin landscapes governing tubular, fibroblast, and immune cell transitions from injury to either recovery or failed repair states. We identified distinct cellular states associated with specific pathological features that show dynamic distributions between acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), organized within unique spatial niches that reveal progression mechanisms from early injury to unresolved disease. Gene regulatory analyses prioritized key transcription factor activities (SOX4, SOX9, NFKB1, REL, KLFs) and their target networks establishing disease states and tissue microenvironments. These regulatory programs were directly linked to clinical outcomes, identifying molecular signatures of recovery and secreted biomarkers predictive of AKI-to-CKD progression, providing a key resource for therapeutic development and precision medicine approaches in kidney disease.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

X.", "abstract": "Understanding the density of marine mammals is important for assessing population dynamics and evaluating the impacts of human activities on these species. In this work, we examine microorganisms that may be ecologically associated, whether directly or indirectly, with baleen whales - the potential \"ecological habitat\" - to predict baleen whale densities via statistical relationships adjusted for seasonal patterns of occurrence. We assessed the capability of microbial and small plankton communities to predict the density of Balaenopteridae whales in the Southern California Current Ecosystem in each quarterly season from 2014 to 2020 using data from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI). Densities were estimated from visual sightings for three target species - blue, fin, and humpback whales - and microbial and small plankton communities were examined using concurrent water samples via metabarcoding of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes. We identified microbial and small plankton communities specific to each target species that were strong predictors of estimated density. Groups of 23-60 distinct Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) per baleen whale species explained 81-99% of variability in estimated whale density and predicted density estimates to within ~1 individual per 1000 km2. The predictive accuracy achieved by our approach, compared with naive seasonal carry-forward and seasonal averaging approaches to prediction, improves out-of-sample RMSE by up to an estimated 65%. Microbial and small plankton communities were characterized by 148 unique taxonomic annotations enumerated across marker genes. Of these, 20% were shared across all three species, 21% were shared by two species, and the remaining (59%) were unique to a single whale species, which suggests that there is some overlap in the ecological habitat among blue, humpback, and fin whales, but each species is also related to a distinct community of microbes and small plankton.  We also conducted a narrative review to examine existing known relationships of baleen whales with microbes or small plankton. Of the 148 unique taxonomic annotations we found to be predictive of baleen whale densities, 23% have been referenced within the existing literature exploring microbial prey, parasites, commensals, or respiratory-associated organisms of baleen whales, with matches at the genus or family level. The rest matched at higher taxonomic levels (41%) or had no documented matches in our literature search (36%).  These findings suggest that some of the microbial and small plankton community predictors may be ecologically relevant, yet further studies are needed to understand how these organisms function collectively as a community and interact with whale ecology, prey, and the surrounding environment. Our results suggest that using microbial and small plankton communities to quantify the potential ecological habitat of larger organisms, like baleen whales, can enhance predictive models and may inform hypotheses about the ecological relationships between whales and the biological communities with which they co-occur.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

M.; Belser, S.; Yang, J.; Wadhwa, N.", "abstract": "Environmental stressors routinely impact bacteria and affect their physiology. Among the most important physiological parameters is the proton motive force (PMF), that powers vital cellular processes and molecular machines. Measuring how PMF responds to environmental stress in real time requires tools that capture rapid physiological changes with high temporal resolution. Here, we use the bacterial flagella motor as an in vivo voltmeter to probe PMF dynamics during hyperosmotic shock. Because motor rotation frequency scales linearly with PMF, this approach enables single-cell electrophysiology with high temporal resolution. We find that hyperosmotic stress causes a rapid and reversible loss of PMF in Escherichia coli, independent of the osmolyte used or the presence of potassium ions. We corroborate these findings by using the Nernstian dye, tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), showing that hyperosmotic shock leads to membrane depolarization. Together, our results highlight the efficacy of the flagellar motor as powerful tool for probing bacterial electrophysiology and reveal that hyperosmotic stress directly disrupts cellular energetics in addition to its mechanical effects.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}

Dynein translocates microtubules toward the growth cone to exert extensile forces for axonal outgrowth. During this process, microtubules are most likely to experience compressive loads, which can result in bending deformation on microtubules called buckling. Such buckled microtubules are impaired in their ability to bear compressive forces and may not contribute significantly to axonal outgrowth. If microtubules are interconnected by cross-linking proteins, they are less likely to be buckled and thus able to resist larger compressive loads. Despite the importance of the buckling and connectivity of microtubules, their effects on the axonal outgrowth have not been investigated to date. In this study, using an agent-based computational model, we created a microtubule bundle to simulate the microtubule system in axons. This bundle increased its length by interactions between dynein-like motors and microtubules against a mechanical load. We found that intermediate cross-linking density resulted in maximal elongation of the bundle, because microtubules were easily buckled at low cross-linking density, whereas the displacement of microtubules was inhibited at high cross-linking density. When individual microtubules were much stiffer, the bundle showed higher elongation even with lower cross-linking density, since stiff microtubules were less likely to be buckled by compressive loads. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms driving axonal outgrowth.", "date": "2025-09-28", "journal": ""}
