We demonstrate that resident cardiac macrophages mediate a process of cardiomyocytes de-differentiation to form a blastema which produces new proliferative cardiomyocytes. Thus, a mammalian heart close to a human heart features the ability to undergo epimorphosis and to regenerate.

Using reinforcement learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations and constant pH MD, we investigate how clinically observed mutations in the {Omega}-loop (at residues V211, G214, E219, and Y221) alter the structure and function of PDC-3. Our findings reveal that these substitutions modulate the dynamic flexibility of the {Omega}-loop and the R2-loop, reshaping the cavity of the active site. In particular, E219K and Y221A disrupt the tridentate hydrogen bond network around K67, thus lowering its pKa and promoting proton transfer to the catalytic residue S64. Markov state models reveal that E219K achieves enhanced catalysis by adopting stable, long-lived active conformations, whereas Y221A facilitates activity by rapidly toggling between bond-formed and bond-broken states. In addition, substitutions influence key hydrogen bonds that control the opening and closure of the active-site pocket, consequently influencing the overall size. The pocket expands in all nine clinically identified variants, creating additional space to accommodate bulkier R1 and R2 cephalosporin side chains. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic basis for how single residue substitutions in the {Omega}-loop affect catalytic activity. Insights into the structural dynamics of the catalytic site advance our understanding of emerging {beta}-lactamase variants and can inform the rational design of novel inhibitors to combat drug-resistant P. aeruginosa.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

These molecular processes are only partially understood and display alterations in disease conditions as well as during aging resulting in impaired regeneration. Here, we used mass spectrometry to quantify the temporal dynamics of more than 6000 proteins during myogenic differentiation. We identified the actin nucleator leiomodin 1 (LMOD1) among a restricted subset of cytoskeletal proteins increasing in abundance in early phases of myogenic differentiation. We show that LMOD1 is already expressed by muscle stem cells in vivo and displays increased abundance during skeletal muscle regeneration, especially during early regeneration suggesting that LMOD1 is important for induction of myotube formation. Of note, knockdown of LMOD1 in primary myoblasts and during skeletal muscle regeneration severely affects myogenic differentiation, while overexpression accelerates and improves the initiation of myotube formation suggesting that LMOD1 is a critical component regulating myogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that LMOD1 physically and functionally interacts with the deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a regulator of myogenic differentiation, especially at the onset of myogenic differentiation. We demonstrate that LMOD1 influences SIRT1 localization and the expression of a subset of its target genes. Consistently, depletion or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 partially rescues the impairment of myogenic differentiation observed after knockdown of LMOD1. Our work identifies a new regulator of myogenic differentiation that might be targeted to improve muscle regeneration in aging and disease.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

F.; Silva, A.; Paiva-Lima, I.; Pronier, E.; Girardeau, G.", "abstract": "The integration of spatial and emotional components into episodic memory relies on coordinated interactions between hippocampal circuits and emotion-processing regions. While the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) supports memory consolidation through sharp-wave ripple (SWR)-associated reactivation of spatial representations, it lacks direct connectivity with key emotional centers such as the amygdala. In contrast, the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is anatomically and functionally embedded within the emotional network. How the dHPC and vHPC coordinate during sleep to support the processing of complex contextual and emotional experiences remains unclear. Here, we used simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from the dHPC and vHPC in rats performing a spatial alternation task under opposite emotional valence and during subsequent sleep. We show that dorso-ventral neuronal assemblies better disambiguate the between valence than isolated dorsal or ventral assemblies. During non-REM sleep, coordinated SWRs orchestrate assembly reactivation across the dorso-ventral hippocampal axis following both aversive and rewarding experiences; however, reactivation after aversive trials more closely mirrors the original neural patterns. This enhanced fidelity is driven by the heightened recruitment of shock-responsive neurons of the ventral hippocampus and spatial replay of the dorsal hippocampus into coordinated SWRs. Our findings identify a mechanism by which the hippocampus integrates the spatial and emotional dimensions of an experience during sleep, potentially routing information to the broader emotional memory network via synchronized SWRs.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

We present BioRSP (Biological Radar Scanning Plots), a geometry-first framework that quantifies how a user-defined foreground subset is distributed across the embedding footprint of a fixed analysis set. BioRSP converts 2D coordinates to polar form around a robust vantage point, scans the set by angle, and computes a radar profile that summarizes signed radial enrichment of foreground relative to background within sliding angular windows using a distance-based radial discrepancy. The profile is reduced to interpretable summaries including anisotropy magnitude, peak directionality, and coverage, and is accompanied by explicit adequacy rules and subsampling-based stability diagnostics so the method can abstain when the geometry is underpowered. We demonstrate BioRSP in a community-standard human kidney single-nucleus reference by analyzing thick ascending limb (TAL) nuclei using published UMAP coordinates and a standardized within-set top-decile foreground rule. Within TAL, BioRSP distinguishes sharply localized rim-enrichment patterns, broadly supported but structured within-type heterogeneity, and near-isotropic profiles, with anisotropy spanning more than an order of magnitude in the pooled TAL analysis. Donor-aware reruns show that per-donor adequacy is frequently limiting, but that directional profiles are stable when donor-level support is sufficient.

How do gap junctional inputs onto active compartments shape LFPs? We developed methodology to record extracellular potentials associated with different patterns of gap junctional inputs onto conductance-based models. We found that synchronous inputs through chemical synapses yielded a negative deflection in proximal extracellular electrodes, whereas those onto gap junctions manifested a positive deflection. Importantly, we observed extracellular dipoles only when inputs arrived through chemical synapses, but not with gap junctions. Remarkably, hyperpolarization-activation cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, which typically conduct inward currents, mediated outward currents triggered by the fast voltage transition caused by synchronous inputs. With rhythmic inputs at different frequencies arriving through gap junctions, we found strong suppression of LFP power at higher frequencies as well as frequency-dependent differences in the spike phase associated with the LFP, when compared to respective chemical synaptic counterparts. All observed differences in LFP were mediated by the relative dominance of synaptic currents vs. voltage-driven transmembrane currents with chemical synapses vs. gap junctions, respectively.

Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) is a key enzyme catalysing the final steps of lignin polymerisation. A genome-wide analysis of white jute (Corchorus capsularis) identified 34 putative laccase genes (CcaLACs), phylogenetically grouped into six clades. Expression profiling revealed predominant expression in phloem tissue (17 genes), followed by leaf (9) and xylem/root tissues (4). Several CcaLACs showed progressive upregulation from early growth to harvest stages. Homology with Arabidopsis laccases highlighted candidate genes involved in lignification, which were further supported by transcriptomic and qRT-PCR analyses. Notably, key CcaLACs showed significantly reduced expression in dlpf, a low-lignin white jute mutant. CcaLAC expression was also responsive to abiotic stresses, including abscisic acid and copper. MicroRNA target prediction identified Ath-miR397a and Ath-miR397b as potential regulators of multiple CcaLACs. Structural and subcellular analyses revealed conserved motifs, transmembrane domains, and diverse cellular localization. Gene ontology analysis linked CcaLACs to lignin and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Among them, CcaLAC28 and CcaLAC32 emerged as strong candidates regulating phloem fibre lignification, providing promising targets for developing low-lignin jute varieties for industrial applications.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

In recent years, genome-wide studies have used catalogs ranging in size from fewer than 200,000 to over 7 million loci. Where these catalogs overlapped, they often disagreed on locus boundaries, hindering the comparison and reuse of results across studies. Now, with multiple groups developing public databases of TR variation in large population cohorts, there is a risk that, without sufficient consensus in the choice of locus definitions, the use of divergent repeat catalogs will lead to confusion, fragmentation, and incompatibility across future resources. In this paper, we compare existing TR catalogs and discuss desirable features of a comprehensive genome-wide catalog. We then present a new, richly annotated catalog designed for large-scale analyses and population databases. Our catalog stratifies TRs into two groups: 1) isolated TRs suitable for repeat copy number analysis using short-read or long-read data and 2) so-called variation clusters that contain TRs within wider polymorphic regions that are best studied through sequence-level analysis. To define variation clusters, we present a novel algorithm that leverages long-read HiFi sequencing data to group repeats with surrounding polymorphisms. We show that the human genome contains at least 25,000 complex variation clusters, most of which span over 120 bp and contain five or more TRs. Resolving the sequence of entire variation clusters instead of individually genotyping constituent TRs leads to a more accurate analysis of these regions and enables us to profile variation that would have been missed otherwise.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

The molecular mechanism by which 7SK binding overcomes an intrinsic Hexim autoinhibition for subsequent P-TEFb inactivation has remained unresolved. Here, using NMR and biophysical methods we demonstrate that Hexim1 homodimer engages two high-affinity sites on 7SK RNA. This dual-site binding triggers a conformational rearrangement in Hexim1's disordered central region that unmasks the Cdk9-binding site, which is otherwise sequestered within an intermonomer dimer interface. These findings reveal how Hexim autoinhibition dictates its specificity for 7SK RNA and prevents premature P-TEFb inhibition in the absence of 7SK, thereby providing a mechanistic understanding of Hexim/P-TEFb assembly into the 7SK RNP and further considerations for understanding Hexim-Tat competition during viral transcription.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Although animals hardly harness the power of photosynthesis, their bioelectrical signals extensively regulate complex electrophysiological behaviors, rendering it a superior target for biomedical innovation. Here, a crude structural mimicry of chloroplast has led us to discover that hollow sphere graphitic carbon nitride nanoparticles (hg-C3N4 NPs) endowed non-genetic, subcellular and intercellular photo-modulation of various excitable and non-excitable cells, accumulatively achieving modulation at tissue/organ function level. The homogeneous hg-C3N4 NPs showed responsiveness to light via both photoelectrochemical and photothermal mechanisms. The hg-C3N4 NPs can be spontaneously internalized with excellent cytocompatibility. Using a focusing laser, the hg-C3N4 NPs enable intracellular optical stimulation with subcellular resolution, inducing calcium transient release in multiple cells and propagation in primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. At multicellular scale, optical pacing and synchronization of cardiomyocyte beating is readily achieved by LED. Further, we demonstrate that hg-CN nanoparticles can be safely delivered into the mouse eye and elicit measurable cortical and behavioral light responses in a subset of animals in a model of advanced retinal degeneration. Finally, application of hg-C3N4 NPs to porcine retinal tissue ex vivo confirmed their modulation capability to directly activate RGCs activity under LED photostimulation.

Mettl5 is associated with intellectual disability (ID), which often includes sleep disturbances. However, the mechanism underlying these sleep disruptions in ID remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the sleep phenotypes resulting from Drosophila Mettl5 mutations. Rescue experiments revealed that Mettl5 functions predominantly within neurons and glia marked by Mettl5-Gal4 to regulate sleep. Previous work established that Mettl5 forms a complex with Trmt112 to influence rRNA methylation. Notably, a mutation in Trmt112 mutation recapitulated these sleep disturbances, implicating translational regulation by the Mettl5/Trmt112 complex. Subsequent RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses of Mettl51bp mutants uncovered downstream effects, including altered expression of proteasome components and clock genes. Rescue experiments confirmed that the net increase in PERIOD protein underlies the sleep phenotype. This study illuminates the interplay between ribosome function, clock genes, and the proteasome in sleep regulation, highlighting the integrated roles of protein synthesis and degradation.

Based on those predictions, and thresholds of cold hardiness at budbreak from literature, timing of budbreak was extracted. Despite the model being untrained to budbreak data, the cold hardiness model resulted in good predictions (RMSE=7.3d) that were further improved based on expected delays from cold damage (RMSE=7.2d). Both increasing and decreasing trends in freeze damage risk were predicted with increasing temperature, depending on the range of mean dormant season temperature (MDST; 1 Nov-30 Apr) in each location.

Traditionally, D({omega})-R1-R2 distributions are separated using manual binning of the diffusivity and anisotropy space to differentiate white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and free water (FW) in brain tissue. However, while effective, this approach oversimplifies complex tissue fractions and does not fully utilize all available diffusion-relaxation parameters. In this study, we implemented an unsupervised clustering approach to automatically classify WM, GM, and FW and explore additional water populations using all components in the D({omega})-R1-R2 distributions on ex vivo and in vivo rat brain, and in vivo human brain. Results showed that a basic separation of WM, GM, and FW is possible using unsupervised clustering even under different multidimensional diffusion-relaxation protocols of rat brain and human brain. Additionally, when there is high frequency-dependent diffusion range, it is possible to obtain a cluster characterized by restriction localized in specific high cell density regions such as the dentate gyrus and cerebellum of rat brain. These findings were compared with rat histological sections of myelin and Nissl stainings. We demonstrated that unsupervised clustering of diffusion-relaxation MRI data can reveal tissue complexity beyond traditional WM, GM, and FW segmentation in rat and human brain without parameter assumptions. The unsupervised cluster approach could be used in other body parts (e.g., prostate and breast cancer) without requiring pre-defined bin limits.

During acquisition, responses emerged late in training as the cue became shock-predictive. Ensemble analysis identified subpopulations of \"freezing on\" and \"freezing off\" cells in the ACC whose activation coincided with decreased neural activity and increased neural synchrony. During 24-h and 48-h recall, ACC responses were robust to early presentations but diminished during late tones; similarly, a subpopulation of neurons emerged that was upmodulated by the CS in early 24-h and 48-h recall. Together, our results demonstrate that ACC neuronal response to a cue reorganizes both within and across sessions, with dynamic changes in population activity, recruitment, and synchrony that mirror changes in novelty and negative valence.

Existing transcriptomic analyses rely on adult tissue-based references, which overlook developmentally important isoform diversity. We used largest-in-class long-read RNA-seq (N=72) to create a comprehensive placental transcriptome reference, identifying 37,661 high-confidence isoforms (14,985 novel) across 12,302 genes (2,759 novel). Contrary to characterizations of the placenta as a \"transcriptomic void,\" we found transcriptional breadth and complexity comparable to adult tissues, with extraordinary splicing diversity in genes controlling obesity, lactogen production and growth, including 108 distinct CSH1 (placental lactogen) isoforms. This improved reference offers two advantages: First, it reduced inferential uncertainty in isoform quantification by 30% and increased the yield of high-confidence transcripts. Applying this reference to short-read RNA-seq datasets (N=344) of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), we found that placental transcription mediated 36% of GDM effects on birth weight, with novel CSH1 isoforms identified as key mediators. We further uncovered ancestry-specific effects, with distinct CSH1 isoforms mediating larger effects in European (24.4%) than Asian (13.4%) populations. Our results establish that utilizing long-read-based, tissue-specific transcriptomic annotations is critical, enabling isoform-resolved analyses that provide greater sensitivity than conventional gene-level approaches for understanding placental function and context-specific variation across diverse biobanks.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Accurate semantic segmentation of these images is critical for both clinical and research applications, yet existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods face challenges in generalizability and robustness. This study introduces MAYOCTransformer, the first transformer-based deep learning model for comprehensive semantic segmentation of OCT images, and evaluates its performance against CNN-based models. Methods: A large dataset of 3,500 OCT images was manually segmented using an iterative deep learning-assisted workflow. The MAYOCTransformer model, based on the Mask2Former architecture, was trained and compared against CNN-based segmentation models, including U-Net, U-Net++, FPN, and DeepLabV3+. Comprehensive segmentation tasks included 10 retinal layer segmentation, choroid stroma and vessel segmentation, and the identification of 9 types of discrete pathological findings including intraretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), pigment epithelial detachment (PED), subretinal hyper-reflective material (SHRM), intraretinal hyper-reflective foci, and reticular pseudodrusen. Model performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) on a hold-out test set with five-fold cross-validation. Additional validation was performed using external datasets, open-source segmentation models, and a randomized blinded expert evaluation. Results: MAYOCTransformer outperformed CNN-based models in most segmentation tasks. Choroid segmentation performance was comparable between MAYOCTransformer and CNN models. External validation demonstrated the model's generalizability, achieving higher DSC scores than publicly available segmentation models. A blinded expert evaluation showed that MAYOCTransformer's segmentation was non-inferior to manual annotations. Conclusion: MAYOCTransformer provides improved segmentation performance over CNN-based models. Its ability to generalize to external datasets suggests potential applicability in clinical and research settings.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Understanding mechanisms that regulate development, differentiation, and functions of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells leads to development of better immunotherapies. By combining primary T-cell culture and a syngeneic mouse tumor model with both genome-wide and custom CRISPR/Cas9 screenings, we systematically identified genes and pathways that regulate PD-1 expression and functions of CD8+ T-cells. Among them, inactivation of a key enzyme in glycoconjugate biosynthesis, beta 1, 4-galatosyltransferase 1 (B4GALT1), leads to significantly enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) activation and functions of CD8+ T-cell. Interestingly, suppression of B4GALT1 enhances functions of TCR-T-cells, but has no effect on chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells. We systematically identified the substrates of B4GALT1 on CD8+ T-cell surface by affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, which include protein components in both TCR and its co-receptor complexes. The galactosylation of TCR and CD8 leads to reduced interaction between TCR and CD8 that is essential for TCR activation. Artificially tethering TCR and CD8 by a TCR-CD8 fusion protein could bypass the regulation of B4GALT1 in CD8+ T-cells. Finally, the expression levels of B4GALT1 normalized to tumor infiltrated CD8+ T-cells in tumor microenvironment are significant and negatively associated with prognosis of human patients.

How do repeated encounters with such structure alter the brain's representations of events? We hypothesized that, with repeated viewing of a film clip, event representations in the brain may adapt by becoming either finer (more detailed) or coarser (more generalized). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from 30 human participants who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while watching three 90-second clips from \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" six times each. We used hidden Markov models and pattern similarity analysis applied to searchlights across the brain to quantify the strength of event structure at different timescales for each clip presentation. We then tested how event structure strength changed at both slow and fast timescales with repeated viewings. Most brain regions exhibited stability in the strength of event structure at both slow and fast timescales. Other regions, however, showed flexible event representations that became more or less granular across repeated clip presentations. Notably, several brain regions exhibited consistent changes in the strength of event structure at a slow timescale across different movie clips. Furthermore, in lateral occipital cortex and middle temporal gyrus, slow timescale structure was correlated with subsequent memory for the clips. These results highlight that event dynamics in the brain are not fixed, but can change flexibly with experience.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

{"title": "Morphogenesis of the diamond-type stereom microlattice and the origin of saddle-shaped minimal surfaces in the echinoderm skeleton", "doi": "10.1101/2025.10.27.684615", "authors": "Humanski, K.; Facchini, G.; Croce, J.; Ko\u0142buk, D.; Dubois, P.; Gorzelak, P.", "abstract": "Echinoderm endoskeleton has a unique trabecular microstructure known as stereom, which can exhibit highly ordered geometries. A particularly striking example of these geometries is the recently discovered \"diamond-type\" stereom, characterized by a diamond triply periodic minimal surface (D-TPMS) geometry and distinguished by its exceptional mechanical and structural properties. Despite its promising features for engineering applications, the morphogenesis of this microarchitecture remains poorly understood, notably due to its uniqueness in the natural world. Here, we applied a multimodal imaging and labeling approach to investigate the developmental processes underlying the formation of the diamond-type stereom in adults of a starfish species Protoreaster nodosus. We showed that this stereom type develops through two principal marginal growth patterns: trabecular trifurcation, which generates successive, horizontally spreading layers and occurs on flat external plate surfaces oriented approximately along the crystallographic {111} planes of the D-TPMS; and trabecular bifurcation, typically occurring along the edges of external plates and in the regions between trifurcating zones, aligned with the crystallographic {100} planes of the D-TPMS lattice. Although these growth patterns may proceed at different rates, they are tightly coordinated, resulting in the coherent D-TPMS microarchitecture. Furthermore, we demonstrated that F-actin cytoskeletal activity is consistently associated with active biomineralization fronts (trabecular tips), regardless of whether the stereom is of the diamond-type or of a less ordered, galleried form. Notably, we also observed that the formation of lateral bridges between adjacent stereom trabeculae is often preceded by the appearance of catenoid-like F-actin structures, suggesting a guiding and templating role for the cytoskeleton in building trabecular connectivity and shaping its peculiar curvature profile. Given the structural conservation of saddle-like features across multiple stereom types, we hypothesize that such minimal surface geometries may emerge as a result of tension-driven cytoskeletal dynamics acting as a physical template during biomineralization. Our observations underscore the critical involvement of the cytoskeleton in adult echinoderm biomineralization, implying that cytoskeletal patterning may actively contribute to complex adult skeletal microarchitecture.\n\nStatement of SignificanceTriple periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are geometrically regular surfaces that extend periodically in three dimensions and locally minimize surface area by maintaining zero mean curvature. Among different TPMS structures, the diamond-type (D-TPMS) is particularly notable for its exceptional mechanical stability, uniform porosity, and minimal surface area-to-volume ratio. Although TPMS-like microarchitectures are not uncommon in nature, D-TPMS structures, with such exceptionally large lattice parameters (>10 {micro}m), are exceedingly rare. One notable natural example of these is the stereom of certain echinoderms. However, the fundamental question of what governs the formation of such highly ordered microstructures remains unresolved. To investigate this, we applied a multi-modal labeling and imaging approach to elucidate the general principles of diamond-type stereom morphogenesis. This study not only provides the first insights into the growth dynamics of this unique microarchitecture, but also highlights the essential role of the cytoskeleton, particularly F-actin, in guiding trabecular connectivity and the emergence of minimal surface geometry, regardless of whether the stereom is regular (periodic in three dimensions) or not (non-periodic, with a more irregular arrangement of trabeculae).", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "AL amyloidosis is a rapidly progressive disorder characterized by clonal plasma cell expansion, excessive production of light chains (LCs), and their misfolding into aggregation-prone monomers. These monomers assemble into oligomers and ultimately deposit as amyloid fibrils, particularly within cardiac tissue, where they contribute to myocardial stiffening and direct cardiotoxicity. A mechanistic model was developed to quantify the interplay between these two pathogenic processes and to examine the kinetics of LC aggregation in different compartments. Simulations reveal that LC aggregation exhibits pronounced nonlinearity: oligomer concentrations remain low during early disease stages, followed by exponential growth driven by autocatalytic conversion. When aggregation is assumed to occur within cardiac tissue, fibril deposition is approximately 25 times greater, and oligomer-induced cardiotoxicity is about five times higher, compared with aggregation occurring in the blood plasma. These differences stem from the smaller cardiac volume, which accelerates autocatalytic oligomer formation. A combined cardiac damage criterion, integrating both oligomer-induced cardiotoxicity and fibril-associated myocardial stiffening, was introduced and found to reach values approximately tenfold higher when LC aggregation occurs within cardiac tissue compared with aggregation in the blood plasma. This parameter may serve as a quantitative measure of cardiac aging or disease severity. The model also predicts that therapeutic intervention markedly reduces, but does not eliminate cardiac injury, highlighting the importance of early treatment initiation in AL amyloidosis.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, we identified a number of genes known to regulate aneuploidy and mitosis, and subsequently focused on PRR14L, a ubiquitously expressed gene previously implicated in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Proximity labeling of PRR14L using TurboID revealed several cell division proteins, including the PP2A-B56 phosphatase complex and the spindle assembly factor TACC3, as PRR14L-interacting proteins. Loss of PRR14L prolongs SAC-dependent mitotic arrest in response to microtubule depolymerization but, paradoxically, leads to catastrophic mitotic errors upon SAC abrogation by MPS1 inhibitors.

Here, we demonstrate that human bronchial epithelial monolayers retain this ancestral capacity, autonomously clearing rhinovirus (RV) within 24 hours by selectively extruding infected cells, a process we term virus-induced cell extrusion (VICE). VICE occurs in two waves: a rapid response occurring independently of virus entry, followed by a replication-dependent wave. Barrier-defective epithelia that cannot extrude fail to clear RV. While extrusion maintains barrier integrity and eliminates local infection, it also expels virus-laden cells, promoting transmission. Thus, VICE enables leukocyte-independent epithelial defence while inadvertently promoting viral transmission, reflecting an evolutionary strategy that prioritizes barrier integrity over containment. These findings redefine epithelia as central players in viral pathogenesis and host protection.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

In the model's first step, traits undergo geometric scaling with a population's change in body size. In step 2, directional natural selection re-optimizes trait shapes such that traits showing positive ontogenetic allometry undergo positive evolutionary allometric scaling while traits that exhibit negative ontogenetic allometry go through negative evolutionary allometric scaling. Five predictions of the model were tested using morphological data for three locomotor-relevant traits in pygopodid lizards. The dataset, which was based on 1,756 museum specimens representing 31 species, supported all of these predictions. An implication of these results is that geometric scaling, driven by natural or sexual selection, may be a mechanism for peak shifts on an adaptive landscape. Given the ubiquity of body size variation in nature, this hypothetical process, termed \"niche scaling,\" may be important to ecological diversification.

We proposed previously that VRACs also support influx of O2*- to localize cytoplasmic redox signals. Methods: We assayed O2*- influx, assessed changes in mRNA expression (RNAseq), and tested multiple phenotypes of cultured LRRC8A knockout (KO) VSMCs. Aortic atherosclerotic burden and inflammation, and mesenteric vascular reactivity were compared between wild type (WT) apolipoprotein E null (ApoE-/-) mice and VSMC-specific LRRC8A KO, ApoE-/- mice. Results: KO cells were less permeable to extracellular O2*-, produced less mitochondrial O2*-, and experienced less oxidant stress (GSH/GSSG, lipid peroxidation, Nrf2 activity) than WT. RNAseq and reporter assays demonstrated reduced pro-inflammatory (NF-{kappa}B and Hif1) transcription. KO cells also under-expressed multiple senescence markers and had longer telomeres. Inflammation causes a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OCR) to glycolysis (ECAR). Both pathways were less active in KO cells, as was expression of glycolytic enzymes. Mitochondrial membrane potential was lower in KO cells, but ADP/ATP and NADP+/NADPH were unaltered, suggesting lower energy demand. Consistent with this, proliferation and migration were both reduced in KO cells. Protein-protein interaction analysis of RNAseq data (PPI Hub) identified Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling. Resting phosphorylation of EGFR (pY1068) and AKT (pS473 and pT308) were all reduced in KO cells, as was and EGF-induced pY1068 and pS308. Following 15 weeks of exposure to a high fat diet (42%) VSMC-specific LRRC8A-/- and 8A+/-, ApoE-/- mice had reduced atherosclerotic lesion area, aortic senescence ({beta}-Gal), inflammation (ICAM, VCAM) and proliferation marker (PCNA) expression compared to WT, ApoE-/- controls. Mesenteric artery vasomotor function was also preserved, and the abundance of MYPT1 and CPI17 was lower in KO vessels. Uptake of oxidized LDL (OxLDL) was significantly reduced in KO VSMCs and impaired by VRAC block in WT cells. Conclusions: Loss of LRRC8A reduced O2*- influx, oxidative stress, inflammation and senescence, lowers energy demand, and in the setting of hypercholesterolemia impaired uptake of oxidized LDL and abrogated atherosclerosis.

However, cell-cell relation extraction has not been established as a standalone biomedical relation extraction task, and no benchmark corpus or systematic evaluation framework currently exists. Fully manual corpus construction is costly and difficult to scale, limiting literature-based analyses of cell-cell communication. Here, we define a sentence-level cell-cell relation extraction task and construct complementary manually annotated corpora under realistic annotation constraints. To enable scalable annotation, rule-based literature mining is used solely as an annotation accelerator to identify candidate sentences, while all relation labels are assigned manually. In addition, an independently annotated PubMed corpus without rule-based filtering is constructed to evaluate robustness on natural sentence distributions. Using these resources, we evaluate representative model configurations involving entity indication strategies, classification architectures, and continued pre-training. Our results show that cell-cell relation extraction remains challenging under realistic conditions. Increasing training data size yields consistent performance gains, and specific combinations of entity-aware architectures and continued pre-training provide modest robustness improvements. Nevertheless, performance on unfiltered PubMed sentences remains in the 70% accuracy range, and error analyses indicate that failures cannot be readily explained by simple surface-level factors. Comparisons with general-purpose large language models further suggest that task complexity, rather than model class, is the primary limiting factor.

The Support Group was also suspected to represent housekeeping genes based on variability patterns. To validate these assumptions, we built protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using the Human Protein Atlas and STRING, incorporating both direct and second-order connections. Crucially, second-order connections were restricted to those made via DEGs, ensuring that connectivity reflected condition-specific stress responses rather than generic hubs. Across two conditions, >75% of Principal Response genes assembled into largest connected components (LCC) that were significantly larger than random networks. Support Group genes also showed strong connectivity and enriched overlap with a housekeeping gene database, supporting their distinct classification. STRING confirmed PPI enrichment but produced less reliable results than our DEG-restricted framework. Overall, this study demonstrates that the novel method identifies biologically meaningful, interconnected stress-response networks.

The papillae of most tunicate larvae are the key sensory-adhesive organ regulating their settlement and metamorphosis. The papillae are nearly always arranged as a group of three morphologically identical organs that arise from an anterior neural plate border region nested between ventral epidermis and more dorsal/posterior neural tube progenitors. Due to their embryonic origin and molecular signatures, this anterior border has been evolutionarily linked to vertebrate placode regions. It was previously shown that the specification, patterning, and morphogenesis of the embryonic papilla region all depend on BMP signaling, though downstream mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that the NKX2-3/5/6 ortholog NK4 is a key transcription factor that acts downstream of BMP signaling to pattern the papillae in the Ciona embryo. We present evidence that NK4 is activated by BMP signaling and encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required to restrict the expression of the papilla regulatory gene Foxg to three cell clusters that give rise to the three papillae. Loss of NK4 function results in the formation of a single large papilla. In contrast, overexpression of NK4 represses Foxg, eliminating the papillae.

While increased extracellular heat shock protein 90 (eHSP90) has been linked to increased MMP-2 activity, this has not been examined in the context of cellular stress.\n\nMethodsWe examined stress-induced eHSP90 in human prostate cell lines by immunoblot. Fluorometric gelatin dequenching and zymography assays measured MMP activity. Wound healing and Matrigel drop invasion assays were used to quantify cell motility. HSP90 knockout (KO) cells were established with CRISPR/Cas9. Proteases were profiled with molecular inhibitors and protein arrays and validated by siRNA knockdown, immunoblot, and motility assays.\n\nResultsStress increased eHSP90 in 4 of 4 human prostate cell lines examined. Surprisingly, it concurrently decreased MMP-2 activity. The functional relevance of this was demonstrated when conditioned media from stressed cells decreased the motility of non-stressed cells. Screening for protease inhibitors that would rescue stress-induced decreases in MMP-2 activity identified a single serine protease inhibitor: aprotinin. Yet, rescue with aprotinin was lost in HSP90 KO cells. A protease array identified stress-induced increases in kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6). Knockdown of KLK6 rescued stress-induced MMP-2 activity and cell motility.\n\nConclusionWe identify a novel stress-induced extracellular network that regulates MMP-2 activity and cell motility. We identified KLK6 as a stress-induced extracellular protease leading to decreased MMP-2 activity and cellular invasion, while eHSP90 is required for the rescue of MMP-2 activity once KLK6 is neutralized.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

E.; Kobeleva, X.; Schmidt, R.", "abstract": "Identifying neural oscillations is essential for linking fast brain dynamics to underlying cognitive states. However, this is challenging because oscillatory events can be brief, embedded in 1/f-like background activity, and may comprise an unknown number of spectrally distinct states. Conventional approaches often apply narrowband band-pass filters to one or a few predefined frequency bands, followed by fixed power- or amplitude-thresholding to identify oscillatory events. Although recent unsupervised alternatives based on Hidden Markov models (HMM) address these limitations, they still require a priori specification of the number of states and can underfit or overfit when the number of states is misspecified. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric method that identifies distinct oscillatory states while inferring an appropriate number of states directly from the data. This method combines time-delay embedding (TDE) with the Dirichlet-process Gaussian mixture model (DP-GMM). TDE augments the signal with time-shifted copies, enabling the DP-GMM to capture frequency-specific local autocovariance structures, while the Dirichlet-process prior adapts model complexity by pruning inactive components. We benchmarked the approach against a filter-based thresholding method and the time-delay embedded HMM using single-channel synthetic data designed to mimic neural time series (e.g., EEG, MEG, and local field potentials), with multiple frequency components embedded in 1/f-like noise. In this setting, the proposed model reliably recovered multiple distinct frequency components under noisy conditions while also inferring the correct number of oscillatory states. Applied to a resting-state motor-cortex MEG dataset, the model identified multiple frequency-selective, short-lived oscillatory states that exhibited substantial inter-individual heterogeneity in peak frequency, occurrence rate, and power. Overall, this provides a fully unsupervised route to discovering frequency-selective oscillatory states without predefining frequency bands or selecting the number of states in advance.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

TOR complexes regulate the ESCRT system to integrate nutrient availability with cell division. TOR activity is frequently deregulated in cancer, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Deregulated ESCRT activity has also been associated with cancer, but its role in mediating drug resistance is not fully understood. Herein, we have investigated the role of the ESCRT system in regulating sensitivity to Torin1.\n\nMethodsGrowth assays were used to monitor the growth of yeast cells. The effect of Torin1 on protein expression was monitored by immunoblotting. Fluorescence microscopy was used to investigate the action of Torin1 on protein localization.\n\nResultsThe ESCRT system mediates Torin1-induced degradation of amino acid and glucose transporters. The expression of these transporters at the plasma membrane is not abolished in ESCRT mutants. Mutants unable to effectively ubiquitylate these transporters are also resistant to Torin1. Impaired ESCRT-mediated protein degradation is associated with strong resistance to Torin1.\n\nConclusionsMutations in genes encoding ESCRT components have been reported in cancer. We present evidence that compromised ESCRT signalling is sufficient for resistance to Torin1. Cells defective in ESCRT signalling or ubiquitin homeostasis are highly resistant to Torin1.

At the molecular level, the majority of Hymenoptera are thought to determine sex by so-called Complementary Sex Determination (CSD). Under CSD, sex is determined by the feminizing effects of one or more allele-rich loci, in which the feminizing function is imparted by the interactions of functionally distinct alleles. Because of high allelic diversity, most diploids are heterozygous and develop as females, whereas haploid individuals develop as males, as do rare homozygous diploids. Despite diverse empirical results suggesting that CSD is widespread in Hymenopterans, and substantial theoretical and empirical study of the consequences of CSD, the molecular biology of CSD has received little attention outside of the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Available evidence provides support for divergent perspectives ranging from a single (nearly) universally-conserved CSD locus or a pattern dominated by evolutionary turnover with different genes serving as the CSD gene(s) in different lineages. Recently, a novel non-coding RNA gene named ANTSR was shown to serve as a CSD gene in different ant lineages, and the authors suggested that ANTSR might serve as a more broadly-conserved CSD gene. To assess the role of ANTSR role in CSD across diverse Hymenoptera, we studied syntenic conservation and polymorphism patterns in the broad ANTSR locus, genome-wide sequence from available male and female diploid Formica ants, and data from a sibling cross for Bombus terrestris. We find evidence that ANTSR is a conserved CSD gene across diverse Aculeata, the largest group of Hymenoptera, and provide preliminary evidence that Formica may have multiple CSD loci including ANTSR.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

M.; Akcay, E.; Rubenstein, D.; Greenbaum, G.; Levin, S.", "abstract": "A diverse array of social carnivores, such as orcas and wolves, also hunt cooperatively, but it is not well understood how prey availability feeds back with the size of social carnivore groups. Cooperative hunting may expand predators' access to food by allowing them to hunt prey they could not catch alone, but many predator groups are much larger than the group size that would maximize individual food intake. One promising explanation is that if individuals can freely leave and join groups, then predators behaving adaptively should continue to join a group until the fitness that they achieve in the group is the same as that of being solitary. Here, we investigate the stable group sizes that form in a population of predator groups when predators hunt two types of prey: big prey that is best hunted in groups and small prey that is best hunted alone. In conjunction, we track the dynamics of the distribution of predator group sizes when individuals make decisions about whether to join or leave groups based on their own fitness. We find that if individual predators are able to freely leave groups and pair up with other individuals, starting new groups, then group sizes at equilibrium are much smaller than expected, generally staying at or below the size that maximizes individual fitness. Furthermore, accounting for flexible group sizes leads to ecological conditions that are not predicted if predator group sizes are held constant; in some regions of the parameter space, predators partition resources by forming a bimodal distribution of group sizes, and as a result, create situations where an increase in one prey type helps the other prey population grow. This result has applications to management of carnivore-livestock conflict, implying that increasing populations of wild prey may protect livestock.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

H.; Stepniewska, I.", "abstract": "To better understand the cortical connections and organization of visual areas in galagos, we examined the interconnections among cortical visual fields and their relationships with posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and temporal regions associated with dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing. In five galagos, two to four distinguishable tracers were injected into different visual areas, allowing direct comparison of connection patterns within the same cases. To reveal distributions of labeled neurons for each injection, labeled cells were plotted from serial brain sections cut parallel to the flattened cortical surface and summed across sections to generate surface reconstructions. Alternate sections processed for cytoarchitectonic features were used to identify cortical borders, especially those of V1 and middle temporal visual area (MT). Overall, our results support the conclusion that regions of V2 and V3 represent the contralateral visual hemifield in parallel with V1 and with each other. However, dorsal V3, representing the lower visual hemifield, includes at least one discontinuity where representations of the upper visual field extend to the dorsal border of V2. This portion of V3 appears to belong to the dorsomedial visual area (DM), which extends rostrally from V2 into PPC. The dorsal part of the DL-V4 region receives projections from other parts of dorsolateral visual area (DL), central V1, V2 and V3, inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the MT complex, and PPC regions surrounding the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). More central portions of DL-V4 receive inputs from central representations of V1, V2, and V3, as well as from PPC regions lateral to the IPS, the MT complex, and upper IT cortex. The ventral part of DL receives projections from central V2, caudal PPC adjoining DM and ventral PPC, and from IT cortex. These patterns indicate that the DL-V4 region serves as a major node linking dorsal and ventral streams and likely includes more than one functionally distinct visual area. In addition, areas MT and DM show strong reciprocal connections with PPC, while the connections of IT cortex indicate that much of this region is visual in nature having strong connections with higher order visual areas and it is composed of multiple functionally specialized visual domains.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

While deep learning co-folding methods can help address these challenges, their evaluation has been hampered by the difficulties in assessing independence from training data and insufficiently large test sets. Here we test the ability of co-folding methods to predict the structures of 557 ligands bound to the SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 macrodomain (Mac1) that were determined after the training cut-off dates. AlphaFold3 (AF3), Boltz-2, and Chai-1 each reproduced >50% of the Mac1 ligand poses to better than 2 [A] RMSD of experiment. Despite the potential for co-folding to describe protein conformational changes that stabilize ligand binding, we did not find that common conformational rearrangements, including peptide flip and a large loop opening, were recapitulated by the co-folding prediction. For AF3 and Chai-1, ligand pose prediction confidence weakly, but significantly, tracked experimental potency, while DOCK3.7 energies were only weakly correlated. Boltz-2 affinity predictions showed the strongest correlation with measured potency and, after calibration, achieved lower mean absolute error than a baseline predictor. We next assessed whether co-folding scores could rescore docking hit-lists to distinguish true ligands from non-binders among hundreds of molecules prospectively experimentally tested against AmpC {beta}-lactamase, the dopamine D4 and the {sigma}2 receptors. AF3 ligand pose confidence values did not separate true ligands from high-scoring false-positives as effectively as docking scores or Boltz-2 affinity predictions did. Taken together, the modest, but independent correlations of docking score and co-folding confidence or affinity suggests that integrating physics-based and deep-learning and approaches may help with hit prioritization and subsequent optimization in structure-based ligand discovery.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

One example is TCF7L2, a transcription factor critical for developing the thalamus and autism spectrum-associated gene. It exists in two isoforms from different promoters: the long isoform (L-TCF7L2) with the {beta}-catenin-binding domain, and the shorter isoform (S-TCF7L2), lacking this domain and classically considered a dominant-negative regulator of the L isoform. Here, we investigated the role of TCF7L2 isoforms in thalamic development using total and isoform-specific knockout strategies. Analysis of axonal phenotypes, regional markers, and RNA-seq uncovered that the isoforms are functionally redundant during development. Immunohistochemistry and ChIP-seq showed that in the embryonic thalamus -- unlike in the postnatal thalamus -- TCF7L2 regulates gene expression independently of {beta}-catenin. These findings reveal a switch from {beta}-catenin-independent and isoform-redundant to classical {beta}-catenin-dependent TCF7L2 activity, occurring between the embryonic and postnatal stages. This suggests that alternative promoter usage may, in some contexts, ensure robust availability of the regulatory protein during brain development.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is the primary eukaryotic AP endonuclease, yet how it identifies rare lesions among vast stretches of undamaged DNA remains incompletely understood. Using single-molecule imaging combined with molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that APE1 employs a distinctive dual mechanism to search DNA. First, Mg2+ coordination at the active site neutralizes clustered negative charges, stabilizing electrostatic contacts during scanning. Second, its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR), a feature conserved only in eukaryotic homologs but absent in prokaryotic ExoIII, not only forms DNA through transient IDR contacts but also engages continuous interactions via the unprecedented 177 arginine residue within the structured nuclease domain, thereby prolonging residence time and enabling long-range diffusion. Together, these two modules synergize to promote a sliding-based search strategy tailored to the complexity of eukaryotic genomes. Consistent with this model, IDR deletion restricts APE1 to 3D collisions, whereas IDR duplication enhances 1D scanning. Thus, APE1 exemplifies how structural disorder and metal-ion coordination integrate to enable long-range lesion recognition, highlighting an evolutionary innovation in eukaryotic DNA repair.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Selective decussation is directed by radial glia and midline neurons in the optic chiasm. Radial glia attach to the underlying pial basement membrane (PBM) that is rich in {beta}2 laminins. Here, we asked whether {beta}2 laminins in the PBM control the selective decussation of RGC axons. Genetic deletion of the {beta}2 subunit increased the proportion of non-decussating RGC axons in the ipsilateral tract. {beta}2 laminins are expressed in the PBM during the peak and late phases of RGC axon growth, and their deletion results in fragmentation of the PBM and dysmorphic radial glia. Consistent with the increase in the proportion of ipsilateral axons, we found persistent expression of the ipsilateral guidance cue EphrinB2 in radial glia during the late phase of axonal decussation, thus extending the developmental window for the development of the ipsilateral projection. Surprisingly, this increase in EphrinB2 was accompanied by an increase in the number of ipsilateral RGCs in the ventrotemporal retina. These results suggest that {beta}2 laminins regulate the size of the ipsilateral projection by providing cues that control the generation of ipsilateral RGCs and the expression of the ipsilateral cue EphrinB2 in the optic chiasm.

Although predicted to arise recurrently, KMDs are generally considered evolutionarily ephemeral--going extinct after fixation or host suppression. The identification of tdk1, a single-gene KMD in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, provides a model for studying KMD evolution. Here, we identify two divergent tdk1 homologs (tdk210 and tdk203) from S. cryophilus, a fission yeast species that diverged ~100 million years ago from S. pombe, as active KMDs. These three KMDs all act via post-germination killing, disrupting chromosome segregation in noncarrier progeny. Notably, they also exhibit striking functional divergences: tdk1, tdk210, and tdk203 are mutually incompatible (showing no cross-resistance), and the latter two act independently of Bdf1/Bdf2--host chromatin proteins required for tdk1 killing. Phylogenetic analyses of the dozens of tdk family genes in Schizosaccharomyces support long-term persistence and rapid evolutionary dynamics of this gene family. Remarkably, homologs in distantly related fungal phyla display genomic and structural similarities to Schizosaccharomyces tdk genes, suggesting a deeply rooted origin of this KMD family in fungi.

To characterize tissue-specific usage, we developed MuSAS, a statistical genomic method leveraging widespread mutational strand asymmetries, such as from APOBEC and mismatch repair deficiency, to map initiation zones across diverse somatic tissues. Integrating these modalities reveals that while intrinsic DNA sequence features establish a high-potential landscape of constitutive origins, tissue-specific usage is governed by local chromatin accessibility acting as a permissive switch.

While recent advances in cryo-EM have revealed domain-specific variations in ribosome structure, tunnel definition and comparative analyses have largely relied on pure geometric algorithms that often approximate the tunnel as a static, single tube with varying radius. Here, we present a functional, nascent-chain-centric characterisation of the exit tunnel across the tree of life, derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using the most complete set of 55 distinct cytoplasmic ribosome structures. By mapping the steric accessibility through the \"eyes\" of the nascent chain (NC) at five different stages of translation, we reveal a topological and stage-dependent complexity invisible to static geometric approaches, demonstrating how tunnel accessibility dynamically changes during biosynthesis. We identify transiently accessible, bacteria-specific lateral branches (\"side tunnels\") that effectively expand the functional volume of the tunnel but may also serve as kinetic traps for the nascent chain. In contrast, we show that archaeal and eukaryotic ribosomes have structurally occluded these cavities by incorporating the protein eL39.

L.", "abstract": "Plant growth and development are tightly coordinated with metabolic status and environmental nutrient availability, yet how intracellular recycling pathways integrate these cues with hormonal signaling remains poorly understood outside angiosperms. Here, we used the model bryophyte Physcomitrium patens to address the role of autophagy in modulating auxin-induced caulonemata development in response to conditions altering the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio. Loss of autophagic function enhanced caulonemata differentiation and colony expansion under ammonium-free and nitrogen-deficient conditions, phenocopying wild-type responses to nutrient starvation even under mild C/N imbalance. These developmental changes were associated with altered carbon homeostasis, increased endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels, reduced gene expression of the auxin exporter PpPINA, and up-regulation of auxin-responsive RSL transcription factors. In contrast, autophagy-deficient mutants show reduced sensitivity to exogenous sugars and exhibit hypersensitivity to prolonged auxin treatment, resulting in growth inhibition and cell death. Autophagic flux analyses revealed that caulonemata-inducing conditions, including auxin supply and nitrogen limitation, generally suppress autophagic activity, particularly during the dark period. Together, our results identify autophagy as a central integrator of metabolic and hormonal signals during early moss development, acting to restrain auxin-driven differentiation in favor of nutrient remobilization and growth homeostasis.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we perform proteome-wide functional screens to identify more than fifty transcriptional activators that are intrinsically specific to CGI promoters, establishing that promoter-class-specific activators are a widespread feature of mammalian gene regulation. Among these, we identify Host Cell Factor 1 (Hcfc1) as the founding member of CGI-specific co-activators. Hcfc1 is essential for the expression of thousands of CGI-promoter-driven genes and acquires CGI-specificity through a two-step mechanism: CGI-associated transcription factors recruit Hcfc1 through its Kelch domain, and Hcfc1 in turn directly engages the general transcription factor TFIID through a dedicated activation domain. The Hcfc1-TFIID interaction overcomes a key rate-limiting step for CGI promoter initiation, TFIID recruitment, thereby directly enabling transcription. Hcfc1 thus functions as a promoter-class-specific bridge between CGI-bound transcription factors and the general transcription machinery, analogous to Mediator but with intrinsic promoter specificity. Together, we uncover a dedicated activation pathway for CGI promoters, reveal a fundamental mechanistic difference in transcription activation between promoter classes in mammals, and establish co-activator-promoter compatibility as a core principle in mammalian gene regulation.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Phage development depends on host physiology and metabolism, much of which is controlled by RNA-based regulation. The bacterial RNA chaperone Hfq is a global post-transcriptional regulator of stress and metabolic pathways, but its role in phage biology is poorly understood. Here, we examined the effect of Hfq loss on P1vir development by comparing the infection kinetics, virion morphology, and global transcriptomes of P1vir and its E. coli hosts in the wild-type and {Delta}hfq backgrounds. Deletion of hfq impaired P1vir lytic development, yielding smaller plaques, reduced burst size, and virions with smaller heads and thinner tails. P1vir transcriptional profiling showed that {Delta}hfq-specific dysregulation emerged early and intensified over time, with disrupted developmental timing, compromised replication and genome processing, and an unbalanced morphogenetic program. In wild-type cells, P1vir infection triggered broad, time-dependent reprogramming of host gene expression, including the induction of central carbon and amino acid metabolism and other anabolic pathways, consistent with a state that supports productive phage replication. In contrast, the {Delta}hfq mutant mounted a narrower response, with limited metabolic induction and late upregulation of chaperones and proteostasis factors, suggesting the accumulation of misfolded proteins or stalled assembly intermediates. Motif scanning of P1vir transcripts identified candidate Hfq-favored sequence features in several under-induced phage genes, suggesting direct Hfq-RNA regulation. Thus, Hfq, although not essential, is important for efficient P1vir lytic development by coordinating phage gene expression with host reprogramming.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Methods: We developed an AR application in Unity compatible with XReal glasses that allowed users to annotate and interact with a realistic 3D hologram of a dog head. Resident and specialist veterinarians were recruited to completed coordinate (distance) and outline (area) annotations under two conditions: (1) transfer: memorizing targets from a computer screen, and (2) direct: seeing the targets directly on the head. Distance errors, area metrics, and completion times were recorded from each participant. Results: The mean distance error (N = 22) was significantly lower for direct versus transfer coordinates (2.73 +/- 0.79 mm vs. 3.42 +/- 1.81 mm). Area coverage (N = 20) was higher (83.7% +/- 13.4% vs. 63.3% +/- 16.2) and non-overlap was similarly reduced with AR-guidance. Completion times differed significantly between the transfer and direct groups for coordinate tasks (11.2 +/- 10.4 sec versus 8.19 +/- sec) but not for area tracing (25.7 +/- 18.3 sec versus 26.8 +/- 26.5 sec). Conclusion: AR-guided visualization improved spatial accuracy for both distance and area metrics without reducing speed. The effects observed for specialty, eyewear, or arm length were negligible.

We propose that beneath their non-pharmacological facade, meditation practices might operate via drug target modulation having profound neurophysiological effects. Firstly, we leverage the Connectivity Map (CMap) to investigate (a) the overlap between meditation-induced molecular signatures and established drug responses, and (b) the pathways and mechanisms contributing to meditation's potential therapeutic effects. This was studied in a comprehensive temporal RNAseq dataset comprising premeditation, meditation, and follow-up stages from a clinical trial involving 106 participants practising inner engineering meditation. Meditation signatures overlapped with over 438 drugs, but predominantly with drugs targeting the neuroactive ligand receptor pathways, capable of modulating the brain's excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. Next, to bridge the meditation-induced molecular changes to measurable neurophysiological effects, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of drugs affecting E/I balance through the lens of non-invasive brain stimulation, i.e., transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS-EMG and TMS-EEG). Using multiple correspondence analysis, we then clustered the CMap informed neuroactive drugs and their E/I effects on the same latent space. We found that meditation's effects mimic drugs targeting the GABAergic, Glutametergic and other neuromodulatory system pathways. Our findings lead to a working model to objectively test neurophysiological changes resulting from meditation that can lead to evidence-based clinical applications. Overall, these findings support the view that meditation acts as a biologically active intervention capable of modulating molecular pathways and cortical excitability, rather than functioning solely as a psychological or contemplative practice.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

We identify a convergent evolutionary trajectory where therapeutic pressure selects for a specific malignant state, cNMF7 (MES-like), characterized by a synergy of hypoxia, stemness, and inflammatory signaling. Integrating spatial transcriptomics across 48 patient sections, we define a \"Spatial Resistance Triad\", a core functional unit composed of cNMF7 cells, differentiation-arrested E-MDSCs, and Type VI Collagen-secreting myCAFs. This triad specifically colonizes the hypoxic microvascular proliferation (MVP) and pseudopalisading necrosis (PAN) niches. Mechanistically, we show that myCAFs act as stromal architects, constructing a fibrotic scaffold through a Collagen/Fibronectin-CD44 signaling axis. This spatial infrastructure not only physically excludes cytotoxic T cells but also provides essential cues to sustain malignant plasticity and myeloid-mediated immunosuppression.

Consequently, most membrane-protein ASR studies restrict analyses to trimmed transmembrane (TM) cores and handle EM segments through manual curation. Here, we propose a structure-guided, indel-aware ASR framework that facilitates reliable reconstruction of full-length 7TM proteins from untrimmed alignments. The approach integrates structure-consistent multiple sequence alignments, profile-mixture evolutionary models, reproducible indel refinement, and AlphaFold-based structural evaluation. We further define a node-level reliability index that summarizes posterior support and predicted structural confidence. Applied to microbial rhodopsins, this framework yields compact, full-length ancestors of schizorhodopsins (Anc-SzR) and heliorhodopsins (Anc-HeR) whose TM cores and EM segments display uniformly high confidence. Indel-aware refinement restores realistic loop and terminal architectures, including characteristic EM beta-strands and short helices. Reliability patterns vary among nodes: Anc-SzR is consistently robust across alignments, Anc-HeR is structurally well resolved but topologically alignment-sensitive, and the deeper their common ancestor retains a confident global fold despite diffuse residue-wise support. Finally, both Anc-SzR and Anc-HeR express in E. coli as stable, colored holoproteins, demonstrating that full-length reconstructions are not only computationally coherent but also experimentally tractable.

First, we identified proteins associated with endogenous USP7 by immunopurification followed by DIA-LFQ-MS. Integration of our new results with earlier interactomes of epitope-tagged USP7 yielded a consensus set of high-confidence protein targets. Domain mapping analysis revealed that, in addition to the TRAF domain, the ubiquitin-like domains of USP7 play a key role in substrate selection. Using specific enrichment of tryptic K-{varepsilon}-GG peptides, we mapped proteome-wide changes in ubiquitinome dynamics following inhibition of USP7. Combining unbiased proteome-wide and targeted quantitative mass spectrometry revealed that deubiquitylation by USP7 can have different effects on the stability of distinct substrates, and suggests that the activity profile of USP7 is substrate-dependent rather than an intrinsic enzymatic property. Thus, in addition to providing a proteome-wide map of USP7 target sites, our multi-angle proteomics approach reveals that the effects of USP7-mediated deubiquitylation on its targets are remarkably variable and substrate-specific.

Aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), particularly MET, drives tumor proliferation, invasion, and therapy resistance. Here, we show that MET inhibition with crizotinib induces senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction in glioma-initiating cells (GICs), in part via downregulation of the mitochondrial protein BNIP3. However, BNIP3 downregulation activates mTOR signaling, enabling adaptive resistance. Targeting mTOR with everolimus in combination with crizotinib synergistically enhances anti-tumor effects, inducing apoptosis, senescence, and necroptosis, and significantly reducing cell viability and sphere-forming capacity. In orthotopic GBM xenograft models, this combination, particularly in a sequential regimen, markedly prolongs survival without overt toxicity. Our findings identify a BNIP3-mTOR signaling axis as a critical mediator of resistance to MET inhibition and provide a mechanistic rationale for combined MET and mTOR targeting as a promising therapeutic strategy in GBM.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrated single-nucleus multiomic (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomic profiling across 38 well-differentiated pancreatic (pNET) and small-intestinal (siNET) tumors to define conserved malignant programs, their regulatory circuits, and spatial niches. We observed two conserved malignant cell programs spanning a continuous transcriptional spectrum: a neuronal-like program (si-cNMF1/p-cNMF1), and a secretory neuroendocrine program (si-cNMF2/p-cNMF2). Matched chromatin accessibility profiles uncovered distinct, tissue-specific regulatory networks, including MAX::MYC and MITF transcription factor binding motifs in siNETs versus ISL1 and TFAP4 in pNETs, indicating organ-specific epigenetic control. Spatial transcriptomic analyses revealed that si/p-cNMF1-high regions localized to high cell density, immune-rich tumor areas, whereas si/p-cNMF2-high regions occupied stromal and vascularized niches and co-occured with fibroblast and endothelial compartments enriched for TGFB1-ITGB1, VEGFA-FLT1, and LAMA2-ITGA1 signaling. Across both tumor types, the cNMF2 program was enriched in metastatic lesions and was enrichedfor pro-fibrotic and pro-angiogenic gene signatures. Thus, GEP-NETs are organized along a conserved neuronal-to-secretory axis defined by distinct epigenetic programs and spatially coupled to specific microenvironmental niches.

Here we introduce PATH-IC, a computational pathology model that predicts ER+ breast cancer IC subtype risk of relapse categories from routine histology data. We enhance the current state-of-the-art computational pathology approach with BERGERON, which leverages generative AI to correct class imbalance and reduce overfitting, showing that synthetic data improves PATH-IC's performance by the equivalent of 41% more real training samples. PATH-IC achieves a testing AUROC of 0.814, with predictions correlating to Oncotype DX scores and long-term relapse risk. Using attention-based model interpretation and CRAWFORD, a novel embedding-to-image foundation model, we demonstrate that PATH-IC identifies expected tumor microenvironment patterns for IC subtypes and highlights heterochromatin condensation as a key feature of high-risk tumors.

D.", "abstract": "Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cortical and spinal motor neuron loss, with most patients surviving only 2-5 years post-diagnosis. While approximately 10% of cases are familial (fALS), the remaining 90% are sporadic (sALS) with unknown genetic drivers. Importantly, clinical presentations are heterogeneous in both sporadic and familial ALS, underscoring the complexity of the disease. A pathological hallmark of ALS is the mislocalization of RNA binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This mislocalization produces both loss-of-function consequences, such as widespread RNA processing and splicing defects, as well as potential toxic gain-of-function effects associated with cytoplasmic aggregation. Results: In this study, we used RT-PCR data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons derived from 180 sALS and C9orf72 fALS patients from the Answer ALS collection to identify biological subgroups based on TDP-43 loss-of-function signatures. Spectral embedding revealed four distinct molecular clusters, including one subgroup genetically similar to controls and another with the most dysregulated mRNA expression, suggesting differing disease severity. Linear mixed models were then used to assess the longitudinal trajectory of over 90 clinical measures, and the between-cluster interaction effects were evaluated. Conclusions: 36 clinical outcomes showed significant differences across clusters, supporting the presence of biologically and clinically distinct ALS subtypes based on the TDP-43-associated pathogenic cascade. These findings demonstrate a critical role of RNA profiling in uncovering biologically meaningful subtypes of ALS, potentially allowing for more precise prognostic tools and the development of future personalized therapeutic approaches.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Elevated FAM84B levels were detected in the postmortem cortex, cerebrospinal fluid, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons of patients with tauopathy. FAM84B facilitates tau secretion through exosome assembly and RYR3-mediated exocytosis, followed by exosomal uptake into neighboring cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, thereby driving tau propagation.

Pubertal onset involves substantial variability in oestradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), yet the impact of these hormone dynamics remains unclear. We investigated whether within-individual E2 and P4 variability across one month relates to brain structure and mental health problems in adolescent females. Methods: Participants were 147 females (11 to 17 years) from the community-based, cross-sectional Puberty and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescents (PANDA) study in Australia. Salivary E2 and P4 were collected weekly for one month, with variability indexed as within-subject standard deviation. Structural MRI was acquired on the final sampling day. Mental health problems were assessed via self- and parent-report. Linear regression and mediation analyses tested associations between hormone variability, brain structure, and mental health, adjusting for demographics. Results: Greater P4 variability was associated with smaller left thalamus volume (d = -0.26, pFDR = 0.031). Higher E2 variability was associated with fewer anxiety (d = -0.170, pFDR = 0.043) and depressive symptoms (d = -0.179, pFDR = 0.036), lower emotion dysregulation (d = -0.179, pFDR = 0.036), and smaller right hippocampus volume in pre-menarchal adolescents (d = -0.192, p = 0.02). Weekly reductions in E2 predicted lower positive affect (d = 0.084, p = 0.048).

We analyzed the direct effect of the DA-type STDP curve and the effect of DA release. We found that the DA-type STDP curve accelerates learning but may promote coarse potentiation of the synaptic efficacy, which leads to false detections. It was also shown that DA can improve the pattern-detection performance up to a 44 percent success rate (2.44 times control) with no false detection, but a DA release with an excessive amount or with too short a delay induces false detection. These results suggest that DA can maintain the pattern detection ability only when released within a limited concentration and a sufficient delay.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

In addition to protecting the ear from acoustic trauma, olivocochlear (OC) efferent neurons participate in signal discrimination by virtue of their inhibitory actions on auditory nerve firing. Given the time course of peripheral degeneration in ARHL, we sought to investigate the central degeneration of medial (MOC) and lateral (LOC) efferent neurons in mutant mice that exhibit genetic hearing loss or deafness at different ages. Tests of cochlear function were combined with anatomical and morphological quantification of changes to somatic number, morphology, and location of OC neurons. Neuronal tract tracing methods were employed to label OC neurons in 1-, 3-, and 6-month-old CBA/CaH mice with normal hearing; DBA/2J mice with progressive, high frequency hearing loss; and homozygous Shaker2 mice with congenital deafness. Deaf Shaker2-/- animals exhibited age-related atrophy and loss of MOCs, with contralateral MOCs more affected than ipsilateral MOCs, while LOCs were largely unaffected. No such OC degeneration was observed in DBA/2J mice, even after progressive elevation of low frequency auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) thresholds. Thus, OC efferent neurons can appear morphologically 'normal' in the complete absence of acoustic input in early life (as in deaf Shaker2-/- animals) and that the retention of these neurons is not affected by late onset high-frequency hearing loss observed in DBA/2J animals. Differential patterns of MOC neuron degeneration may affect functional plasticity of auditory brainstem feedback circuitry in ARHL.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Across individual neurons, this code uniformly boosted their responses to the segmented object. In the population space, this code created an orthogonal representational geometry by perpendicularly displacing the neural manifold for image features, efficiently multiplexing both local and global information about the object.

Less appreciated is its impact on microtubules (MT), except for suggesting that it promotes microtubule depolymerization, raising the question of whether rotenone also impacts primary cilia (PC) that are microtubule-based signalling hubs, which are essential for neuronal function. Using hTERT-RPE1 (or RPE1) cells, which assemble PC upon serum starvation, we discovered that brief exposure to rotenone (2-6 h) at low concentration (100 nM) causes a striking elongation of PC and hyperacetylation of cytoskeletal microtubules. At this concentration, rotenone does not significantly alter mitochondrial dynamics or bioenergetics, and these phenotypes could not be reversed by pre-incubating cells with ROS scavenger NAC, or supplementing cells with NR. Thus, these observed effects of rotenone treatment in quiescent cells are predominantly independent of mitochondrial toxicity. Depletion of -TAT1, the -tubulin acetyltransferase, eliminated microtubule acetylation without preventing ciliary elongation, suggesting that rotenone drives PC extension through additional mechanisms. Importantly, rotenone increases soluble tubulin pools, owing to its microtubule destabilizing effect, which are likely the mechanism contributing to ciliary axoneme elongation as well as hyperacetylation of cytoskeletal microtubules. Critically, such aberrant increase in PC length impaired Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signalling, which is exclusively transduced by PC during embryonic development and is critical for maintaining adult tissue homeostasis. Thus, our findings reveal that even brief, low-dose rotenone exposure induces aberrant elongation of PC in quiescent cells that assemble PC, while simultaneously disrupting the function of PC. Based on our observation and previous studies, we propose that such ciliary dysfunction represents an underappreciated mechanism by which rotenone contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease via affecting neuronal primary cilia.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

This effect is relatively independent of microtubule acetylation since inhibition of tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 did not mimic the effect of PTXL, promoting instead a slow release of GEF-H1 from microtubules and lagged accumulation of phosphorylated NM2. Unexpectedly, depletion of tubulin acetyl transferase TAT1 also induced NM2 phosphorylation, indicating that microtubule acetylation maintains contractile homeostasis.

In our investigation of porcine follicular atresia mechanisms, we identified five differentially phosphorylated residues in 17beta-HSD1. Using in vitro site-directed mutagenesis and transgenic mouse models carrying point mutations, we established that Ser30 and Ser274 are critical phosphorylation sites that robustly modulate 17beta-HSD1 enzymatic activity. We further demonstrated that activin A and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) enhance 17beta-HSD1 activity by promoting its phosphorylation at these two sites. To target these regulatory residues, we designed and synthesized cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) that specifically suppress 17beta-HSD1 phosphorylation. Functional assays conclusively demonstrated that these CPPs significantly suppressed 17beta-HSD1 activity in vitro. Notably, they also inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells, as well as tumor growth in a mouse model of breast cancer. Our study provides novel mechanistic insights into the regulation of 17beta-HSD1 and E2 synthesis, addressing a critical gap in steroid hormone biology. The identification of Ser30/Ser274 as functional phosphorylation sites and the development of CPP-based inhibitors offer both theoretical advances and translational potential, opening new avenues for the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

We demonstrated phlda2+ cells constituted a primordial CM compartment localized between compact and trabecular muscles. Genetic ablation of phlda2+ CMs during development severely disrupted heart morphogenesis, leading to defective myocardial trabeculation and compaction, and impaired coronary vascularization.

The results indicate frequent exchange of L. sticticalis populations between China and Mongolia in 2022. The L. sticticalis migrants initiating their flights from Mongolia primarily undertook a southeastward migration pathway, supplemented by eastward \"cyclonic\" and southwestward paths. The main landing areas were located in North China and Northeast China, with migration events potentially extending to Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang provinces. Populations originating from North China exhibited a capacity for migrating into Northeast China and Mongolia through 1 to 5 consecutive nights of flight. During this period, the Northeast China Cold Vortex (NCCV) and the Mongolian Cyclone alternately regulated the synoptic circulation pattern governing the migration of L. sticticalis.

M.; Moyle, L. C.", "abstract": "Sexual interactions among closely related species can select for divergence in reproductive traits as a mechanism to avoid the costs of hybridization. This selection, termed reinforcement, produces a canonical pattern of stronger isolation in populations that are sympatric with congeners, versus in allopatric populations. While reinforcement has been observed in many systems, the resulting pattern might be transient. There must be selection against migrants between allopatry and sympatry-akin to local reproductive adaptation-for a pattern of stronger sympatric isolation to be maintained. We tested for evidence of this selection against migrants in the context of sperm competition, in Drosophila pseudoobscura. Previously we showed an advantage of sympatric genotypes in sympatric contexts, via their elevated reproductive isolation (conspecific sperm precedence) against congeneric D. persimilis. Here, using experimental crosses that simulated migration between populations that are naturally sympatric and allopatric with D. persimilis, we show that sympatric genotypes are at a sperm-competitive disadvantage against allopatric male genotypes. This selection against sympatric males in allopatry, combined with the advantage of sympatric genotypes in sympatry, produce a scenario for strong selection against migrants between these two geographic contexts. This is accompanied by population differentiation in reproductive gene expression and allele frequency variation between allopatry and sympatry, including genes with known roles in sperm competition. While some of these changes are parallel among sympatric or allopatric contexts, most are unique to individual populations and might reflect the unique ways that selection has acted on sperm competition genes in different sympatric populations.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Recent progress in multiomic profiling of human embryogenesis enables the discovery of novel candidates from established GWAS data. Here, we developed an approach to prioritize GWAS variants using the epigenomes and single-cell transcriptomes of embryonic tissues and progenitor cells by implementing machine learning classifiers and combinatorial analysis. Systematic evaluation revealed significant improvement in the machine learning model performance after integrating transcriptome of neural crest cells (NCCs) and cranial placodes, as well as epigenomic profile of early craniofacial tissues. We identified 249 genes from the best-performing classifier, which include documented CFM-associated genes.

Experiments: To recreate culture conditions for cells to exhibit reduced focal adhesions, we synthesized PMMA nanoparticles by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA), employing varying conditions of surfactant concentrations, and allowed them to self-assemble into nanoparticle substrates. Following guidelines from previous work, we selected nanoparticle substrates of dimensions ~70nm, suitable for the prevention of focal adhesion formation. Primary human melanocytes were cultured on these substrates to verify the reduction of their focal adhesions; following that the cultures were characterized in terms of their expression of distinct sets of genes related to stemness and differentiation.

While post-operative motor studies have defined neurophysiological signatures of subthalamic local field potentials, comparable studies in the Globus pallidus internus are needed. Recent work shows that subthalamic bandpower and phase-amplitude coupling reliably distinguishes locomotor states, motivating parallel investigation in the Globus pallidus internus. Objectives: To characterize pallidal bandpower and phase-amplitude coupling across locomotor states (sitting, standing, and overground walking) in Parkinsons, and relate to clinical motor scores. Methods: Bandpower and phase-amplitude coupling from pallidal signals of six adults with Parkinsons were compared across locomotor states; inter-state differences were correlated with clinical scores. Results: High beta and gamma power differentiated sitting from walking, while delta power distinguished standing from walking. Phase-amplitude coupling between lower phases and gamma amplitude decreased during walking. Standing-to-walking delta-power modulation strongly correlated with Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale scores (R = 0.9, p < 0.05). Standing-to-walking beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling modulation highly correlated with freezing-of-gait scores (R = 0.86, p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study provides the first detailed characterization of Globus pallidus internus activity in these locomotor states in Parkinsons. The coupling between lower frequencies and gamma was lower during walking as compared to sitting and standing, revealing an inverse relationship to what has been reported in the subthalmic nucleus. These findings suggest that movement coordination in the Globus pallidus internus may rely on a balance of single- and cross-frequency mechanisms.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Constructing accurate models, however, remains challenging: at low resolutions it is difficult to interpret density maps features reliably, and at high resolutions traditional model-building workflows can become a time-consuming bottleneck. Deep learning, which is transforming problem-solving across scientific domains, offers powerful new tools to automate and accelerate this process. In this review, we discuss deep learning-based methods developed to automate model building in cryo-EM density maps, assessing their impact on streamlining structure determination. Recognizing that biomacromolecular structures exhibit hierarchical organization, we classify these methods according to their ability to model primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of biomolecules. Deep learning tools for building atomic models in cryo-EM density maps are further grouped as de novo, where the model is predicted directly from features learned from the cryo-EM density, or hybrid, where it is derived by integrating structural templates with these features.

Z.; Zheng, X.; Gu, Q.", "abstract": "Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables structure determination of macromolecular complexes, yet reconstructions are often degraded by noise, anisotropic sampling and reconstruction artifacts. Correcting these effects is an ill-posed inverse problem that requires strong prior knowledge in addition to experimental data. Here we introduce cryoFM, a generative foundation model for cryo-EM densities that unifies data-driven structural priors with dataset-specific constraints within a Bayesian inference framework. CryoFM is trained in an unsupervised manner on thousands of high-quality cryo-EM maps using flow matching, learning a generalizable prior over macromolecular density distributions. Combined with explicit likelihood models describing experimental degradations, cryoFM enables flow posterior sampling, an inference-only procedure that performs denoising and restoration and refinement while remaining explicitly constrained by dataset-derived statistics. We show that this framework improves density reconstruction and refinement across diverse experimental settings, including preferred-orientation datasets and cases with strong spatial heterogeneity in signal-to-noise ratio, without introducing hallucinated features. In addition, cryoFM can be fine-tuned into conditional generative models for density post-processing, yielding maps with improved interpretability and fewer artifacts compared to existing supervised approaches. Together, cryoFM establishes generative foundation models as a principled and controllable framework for cryo-EM density reconstruction and modification.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Assuming that evolution would have selected against the production of such a fitness lowering molecule, we postulated that SolA must serve another, beneficial, role for the plant. In this study, we demonstrate that nitrogen (N) deficiency strongly increases the SolA concentration in tomato root exudate. Moreover, SolA is produced only under non-sterile conditions, indicating that soil microbiota are involved in its production. Time-resolved RNAseq analysis revealed several candidate genes for SolA biosynthesis, which were all upregulated under N deficiency. Transient silencing of two SolA biosynthetic genes (e.g., CYP749A19 and CYP749A20) significantly reduced SolA production. Microbiome analysis on the rhizosphere of these plants demonstrated that the recruitment of beneficial Massilia spp. was inhibited in the transiently silenced plants. Isolation of a Massilia strain, identified as Massilia cellulosiltytica, allowed us to show that it has growth-promoting activity under N deficiency, likely via indole-3-acetic acid production and enhanced N acquisition. Root exudate of N-starved tomato displayed strong chemotactic activity towards this strain. Together, these findings demonstrate that SolA production under N deficiency relies on the interaction between tomato and soil microbiota that convert a plant-produced precursor that is a recruitment signal for beneficial, growth-promoting microbes to SolA, which was hijacked by cyst nematodes as a reliable host presence cue. This dual functionality resembles the microbial transformation of primary into secondary bile acids, important signalling molecules, in the gut of animals, and suggests convergent evolution in host microbe co-metabolism. Overall, our study positions SolA as a multifunctional signaling molecule in rhizosphere interactions, with potential application for enhancing crop resilience and sustainable pest management.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we identified Bos taurus TdT (BtTdT) through UniProt database mining as a catalytically active scaffold for natural and 3'-modified dNTPs. Comprehensive characterization of BtTdT's enzymatic properties--including pH, temperature, metal ion dependence, and substrate specificity--revealed its optimal conditions. Truncation of the BRCT domain generated variants with enhanced activity compared to wild-type BtTdT.

Epigenetic and transcriptomic clocks revealed a reduction of predicted age, accompanied by coordinated activation of canonical and previously unrecognized thermogenic pathways.

An extensive body of literature views the ability to spontaneously explore a rich repertoire of activity patterns, even during rest, as a correlate of the capacity to respond rapidly to internal fluctuations and external stimuli. Brain flexibility, defined as the number of unique patterns of activity explored, has been used to quantify the richness of resting-state dynamics. Beyond its theoretical relevance, brain flexibility successfully indexes pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, this approach is inherently global and provides no information about the contribution of each region to the flexibility of brain dynamics. Given the functional and structural heterogeneity of brain regions, we expect their roles in sustaining flexibility to be heterogeneous and related to regional structural properties. To investigate these hypotheses, we present the flexibility gradient (FG), which quantifies regional contributions to flexibility. To quantify FG across the brain, we employed three datasets spanning different recording techniques and a range of spatial and temporal scales. We used 47 MEG and 11 EEG recordings to access fast dynamics, while to investigate slower dynamics, we leveraged 77 fMRI recordings along with the corresponding tractographies. We found that FG is not homogeneously distributed, with associative regions contributing the most. The same gradient is evident within each hemisphere independently, and the structural properties of brain regions correlate with the FG.

Moreover, which pre-synaptic processes rely on neuronal vs astrocyte-derived cholesterol is unknown. Using nanoscale-precision imaging of single-vesicle release in hippocampal synapses we demonstrate that astrocytic cholesterol is a critical determinant of both temporal and spatial aspects of presynaptic dynamics by differentially modulating the two main forms of synchronous release, uni-vesicular (UVR) and multi-vesicular (MVR), effectively fine-tuning their balance. Disruption of astrocytic cholesterol trafficking to neurons combined with its re-supplementation demonstrated that astrocyte-derived cholesterol is necessary and sufficient to determine the UVR/MVR balance. Moreover, astrocytic cholesterol determines the spatial distribution of vesicle release by modulating utilization of different release sites across the active zone. Astrocytic cholesterol also regulates the balance of the two main forms of single-vesicle endocytosis, fast and ultra-fast. These findings suggest that astrocytic cholesterol supply is a critical modulator of synaptic strength that fine-tunes the balance of different forms of synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

These uPAR-high microglia drive neurite retraction in iPSC-derived neurons.

Target specificity was assessed in human microglia C20 cells driven into a pathogenic state by poly(IC) or IFN{gamma} stimulation, which resulted in robust surface uPAR expression alongside phagocytic (CD68) and antigen-presenting (CD80) markers. uPAR-CAR-T cells induced antigen-dependent cytolysis of uPAR-high microglia, reducing their viability by over 80% while sparing resting microglia and neurons in a mixed culture system.

Two rings receive countervailing velocity signals that shift neuronal activity bumps around all three rings. An alternative, classical continuous-attractor model invokes only one ring but requires velocity-modulated synaptic connections. A single-ring compass has been discovered in the anterior hindbrain of zebrafish. Using theory and experiments, we find, however, that three rings, including two shifter rings, are intermingled on the same anatomical scaffold.

We conducted two studies of sleep/wake, activity and body temperature in AppNL-G-F mice, a strain that exhibits three mutations in the human App gene associated with elevated risk for early onset AD. First, AppNL-G-F mice were compared to wildtype (WT) littermates at 14-18 and 18-22 months of age and, at both ages, were found to exhibit partial insomnia with more Wake and less NREM and REM sleep than WT littermates. This long wake/short sleep phenotype was evident during the dark phase at 14-18 months but occurred in both the light and dark phases at 18-22 months. AppNL-G-F mice had fewer short (<60 sec) and more long (>260 sec) Wake bouts and were hyperactive at 18-22 months, which undoubtedly contributed to the increased Wake/reduced sleep. Despite this partial insomnia phenotype, AppNL-G-F mice were no sleepier than WT mice and the sleep homeostat was functional in both strains. In the second study, sex differences in these parameters were assessed at 18-24 months. Partial insomnia was evident in both sexes of AppNL-G-F mice but was clearly stronger in females. Wake and REM sleep bout durations were longer in both sexes of AppNL-G-F mice than in WT littermates. EEG spectral power during NREM sleep was reduced in female AppNL-G-F mice between 4.88-10.50 Hz compared to WT mice whereas, during REM sleep, both male and female AppNL-G-F mice exhibited reduced spectral power in the theta range.

It remains unresolved whether non-face expertise across heterogeneous domains converges on a shared, domain-general whole-brain architecture, or instead recruits domain-contingent neural configurations that vary with task and stimulus demands. We conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 22 task-fMRI studies spanning 11 real-world non-face expertise domains (579 participants, 210 peak-activation foci). Primary analysis revealed a robust, right-lateralized parieto-temporo-occipital circuit centered on the middle occipital gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus and adjoining inferior parietal lobule. We propose that this circuit constitutes a domain-general neural core that integrates fine-grained visual features with semantic associations while supporting attention-guided recognition of visually similar objects in expert performance. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses uncovered a complementary adaptive component, the engagement of which varied systematically with representational and contextual factors. Pictorial stimuli and expert-novice contrasts reliably strengthened recruitment of the right-hemisphere core, whereas symbolic stimuli engagement toward left temporal regions while selectively re-engaging right-core nodes.

A.", "abstract": "Ongoing brain activity displays rich temporal variability associated with efficient cognition, with functional connectivity (FC) continually reconfiguring over time. The resulting functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) specifically show complex, fat-tailed statistics that alternate between persistent epochs and faster reconfiguration transients. While nonlinear whole-brain models tuned nearby a critical point have reproduced some aspects of FCD, they fall short of capturing its full temporal complexity. We propose that slow fluctuations in arousal offer a biologically plausible mechanism for exploring critical regimes in large-scale brain dynamics and thus enrich FCD. Using a connectome-based model of coupled cortical populations, we identified phase boundaries where system dynamics transition between regimes of faster or slower FCD. We then phenomenologically incorporated arousal changes, modeling them as stochastic fluctuations in key parameters such as cortical excitability, input gain, and noise amplitude. This non-autonomous formulation enables the system to roam dynamically across regime boundaries, flexibly tuning its distance from critical transition lines and producing intermittent transitions that mirror the stochastic evolution observed in empirical FCD. Fitting these models to human resting-state fMRI and performing model comparison, we find that arousal-driven models more accurately reproduce the distinctive quantitative features of FCD with the greatest improvements coming from the previously poorly accounted fat-tailed portions of the distributions. Together, these results suggest that arousal fluctuations - likely mediated by changes in neuromodulatory tone-- shape the brain's attractor landscape over time, expanding the repertoire of accessible functional network states and providing a mechanistic basis for the complexity of spontaneous functional dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

When a target is highly salient, it can pop out, suggesting parallel processing of all items irrespective of set size. By contrast, high similarity among items requires item-by-item comparison with an attentional template, a characteristic of serial search. Despite this long-standing distinction, little is known about the neural correlates of search modes, as typical differences in visual displays confound interpretation. Here, we contrasted the neural correlates of serial and parallel search under visually identical displays. Across distinct blocks, we biased 24 participants (21 female) toward parallel or serial search by varying target distractor similarity, thereby directing attentional focus toward a single feature or conjunction. Embedded among inducer trials, test trials were visually identical across all blocks and afforded both parallel and serial search. Behavioral analyses confirmed successful induction of distinct search modes during test trials. EEG decoding reliably discriminated search modes and these neural patterns generalized across inducer and test trials. Attentional deployment toward the target differed across search modes, revealing topographical differences in target location representations. The strength of target-location representations correlated with response times, indicating that during parallel test trials, participants switched search strategies when the target was not detected early. Moreover, target representations diverged between search modes: a temporally stable pattern emerged during serial search, suggesting reliance on working memory, whereas parallel search was characterized by more dynamic representations, likely reflecting prioritization of the relevant feature.

Although sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep have been associated to consolidation, it remains unclear whether all spindle types contribute equally. Spindles vary in frequency and topography - slow spindles (<=12.5Hz) predominating over frontal regions, whereas fast spindles (>12.5Hz) peak parietally - and recent work suggests that procedural memory consolidation during overnight sleep is related to the temporal organization of spindles in trains (i.e., events occurring <6s apart). Here we investigated whether a similar mechanism operates for declarative memory during daytime naps. Participants were assigned to a Nap (N=23) or No-Nap (N=15) group, and completed an object-spatial location task involving 36 item-location associations. Memory was assessed immediately after learning and again following a 90-minute nap or an equivalent wake period. Results showed that the Nap group exhibited significantly better delayed memory, as measured by combined recall-recognition score, and a greater proportion of participants maintained or improved their performance. In the Nap group, memory performance correlated with local spindle density at frontal and parietal sites, and, critically, with the proportion of slow spindles clustered in trains during NREM2.

Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible. We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017). Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018). Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust. Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting.

To examine group I afferent contribution, the same high-intensity protocol was applied during upper-arm ischemia after reducing the ECR H-reflex to <10% of baseline. Sensory-motor input characteristics across stimulation intensities were compared using post-stimulus time histograms of ECR single motor unit firings during weak voluntary contraction. Results: High-intensity PMS significantly increased ECR MEPs after 9 min of intervention, whereas 1.2xMT of PMS required 15 min to induce a marked effect. PMS at 0.9xMT did not induce significant MEP changes. Across all intensities, the FCR MEPs remained unaltered. ECR MEPs remained markedly elevated for up to 30 min after 9 min of high-intensity PMS. In contrast, PMS delivered during ischemia produced no MEP enhancement. The motor unit analysis revealed that suprathreshold PMS elicited an early peak in firing probability--consistent with monosynaptic Ia excitation--whose amplitude increased with stimulation intensity, whereas PMS at 0.9xMT produced no discernible peak. Conclusions: Repetitive PMS above MT facilitates corticospinal excitability in an intensity-dependent manner. Facilitation was abolished during ischemia. Together with the presence of a short-latency peak in motor unit firing via a monosynaptic pathway, this finding supports a major contribution of large-diameter muscle afferents, with a substantial Ia component, to PMS-induced corticospinal facilitation.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Classically, saccades can be reliably evoked by delivering low-intensity electrical microstimulation to the FEF. Although this makes clear the importance of FEF in the descending control of eye movements, the way in which population activity in the FEF is integrated by downstream regions to generate a motor command remains a mystery. To probe these mechanisms, we used a 16-channel microelectrode array to deliver microstimulation to the FEF of two awake, behaving monkeys. First, we found that larger current intensities were required to evoke changes in saccade direction relative to saccade amplitude when single-site saccades were evoked by stimulating a single contact on the array. Second, when stimulating two contacts simultaneously to investigate how population activity in the FEF is read out, a new polar average model more accurately predicted the amplitude and direction of dual-site saccades than traditional vector sum and vector average models. Using preexisting data from the superior colliculus (SC), we found that although the polar average model was more accurate at predicting saccade amplitude in the SC, it was no more accurate than traditional models at predicting saccade direction. Finally, when stimulating two contacts in FEF simultaneously with unequal current intensities, model accuracy depended on the amplitude of the saccades evoked by stimulating each individual site alone, suggesting that the brain may flexibly combine amplitude and direction information from the FEF to generate saccadic plans.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, we explore whether primates can synchronize to complex rhythms and acquire rhythmic representations with generalizability akin to humans. Using controlled behavioral experiments, we provide evidence that monkeys not only can synchronize to short-long or long-short rhythms but also learn representations that generalize across a wide range of rhythm ratios and total durations. These results indicate ability to flexibly represent ratios within a relative timing framework is not exclusive to humans, but it is also present in monkeys. In addition, the produced intervals show a bias towards rhythmic categories. Notably, in an iterative tapping task, macaques and humans showed large priors for isochrony and integer ratios (2:1, 3:1).

Many flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), evade this pathway through non-structural protein 5 (NS5)-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of STAT2, yet the contribution of this immune evasion strategy to viral fitness and pathogenesis remains incompletely defined. Here, using a multistep mutational scanning strategy that jointly assessed STAT2 degradation and viral RNA replication, we identified a single NS5 residue, L162, as uniquely permissive to substitution that abolishes STAT2 degradation without compromising intrinsic replication functions. Substitution of L162 with alanine or glycine (L162A or L162G) selectively disrupted NS5 recruitment of the ZSWIM8-CUL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby preserving STAT2 stability and restoring IFN signaling. Recombinant ZIKV carrying these mutations exhibited reduced replication and enhanced ISG induction in human cells, defects fully rescued by STAT2 knockout. In A129 mice (type I IFN receptor deficient), mutant and WT viruses replicated comparably, but in human STAT2 knock-in mice, ZIKV-NS5L162G exhibited markedly reduced viral loads and disease. Notably, infection with ZIKV-NS5L162G elicited robust neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses that conferred protection against WT challenge. Together, these findings establish NS5-mediated STAT2 degradation as a central determinant of ZIKV immune evasion, viral fitness and pathogenesis, while providing a conceptual framework for targeting viral immune antagonism in antiviral and attenuation strategies.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Here, bacterial community dynamics during ukwa fermentation were resolved across six time points using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Fermentation followed a structured, stage-wise trajectory, beginning with plant-associated aerobic taxa, transitioning through a mid-phase dominated by fermentative firmicutes, and culminating in late-stage enrichment of acid-tolerant lactic and acetic acid bacteria. Microbial richness increased progressively during fermentation, while community composition clustered by time and correlated strongly with declining pH and moisture. Multivariate analyses identified these physicochemical gradients as primary drivers of succession. Network analysis further revealed distinct co-occurrence modules, indicating coordinated microbial guilds that underpin functional transitions during fermentation. This study provides the first sequencing-based ecological framework for ukwa fermentation and highlights how environmental filtering and microbial interactions shape community assembly in traditional African solid-state fermentations. These insights provide a basis for improving process control and guiding future starter culture development for ukwa and related fermented foods.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we use bulk and single cell RNASeq to show that osteoblast injury responses involve rapid and extensive transcriptional reprogramming, yielding a cell state that shares characteristics with embryonic osteoblasts, but also expresses many regeneration-specific genes. One gene characterizing this state is the canonical Wnt ligand wnt10a. Using genetic and transgenic perturbations, we demonstrate that wnt10a-dependent Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling cell-autonomously induces osteoblast dedifferentiation. Loss of wnt10a or of Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity blocks the dedifferentiation program, whereas wnt10a overexpression enhances dedifferentiation and is sufficient to induce it even without injury. Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling promotes dedifferentiation by suppressing NF-{kappa}B activity, placing it upstream of known cues whose loss causes dedifferentiation.

This extension focuses on detecting genetic loci with non-zero average causal effects (ACE) on child phenotypes, taking into account that siblings share similar random family-specific effects. We construct a potential outcomes trait model that considers both individual-level and family-level heterogeneity, captures additive and non-additive genetic effects, and accommodates both quantitative (continuous or count) and dichotomous traits. We design an unbiased estimate of the ACE and develop a sampling variance estimate to form a statistic testing the null hypothesis of no causal effect.

In this study, we present the first successful application of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to authentic aDNA from ancient human remains dating to the Early Jomon period. Our results demonstrate that nanopore platforms can recover characteristic postmortem damage signatures, generate genome-wide information with time-stamped sequencing data, and produce population genetic inferences consistent with Illumina short-read data. Crucially, the ONT sequencing has enabled the first demonstration of time-resolved aDNA analysis. This enables key genetic metrics, such as biological sex inference, to be determined within the first 60 minutes of sequencing. The portability and operational simplicity of ONT devices provide a practical basis for on-site paleogenomics, facilitating the generation of genomic data directly at archaeological sites, in museums, or at local research institutions. This capability is particularly significant in regions where the export of biological specimens entails administrative procedures, often spanning several months or even years. By enabling local archaeologists and anthropologists to independently generate and interpret genomic data, on-site nanopore sequencing can accelerate global research alliance, and promote equitable scientific authorship and continuing dialogue on sample sovereignty and collaborative research practices between geneticists and field researchers.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential components of muscle cell membrane phospholipids and are especially susceptible to peroxidation due to the presence of double bonds. Currently, therapeutic options targeting lipid peroxidation to prevent muscle wasting are limited. Substituting the hydrogen atom at the bis-allylic position with deuterium could conceivably limit lipid peroxidation while retaining enzymatic PUFA metabolism. Here we investigated the potential role of deuterated PUFAs (D-PUFAs) in protecting against muscle cell dysfunction under conditions of elevated oxidative stress. Both native (H-) and deuterated (D-) forms of long chain PUFAs including arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) stimulated in vitro muscle cell growth and development in the absence of oxidative stress. D-ARA, D-EPA, D-DPA, and D-DHA each protected cultured myotubes against the deleterious effects of direct exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) by limiting lipid peroxidation. In contrast, H-ARA, H-EPA, H-DPA, and H-DHA each increased sensitivity to ROS-induced lipid peroxidation and exacerbated oxidative stress-induced muscle cell dysfunction. Deuterated short chain linoleic acid (D-LA), alpha linolenic acid (D-ALA), as well as D-ARA and D-EPA (but not D-DPA or D-DHA) also protected against the deleterious effects of ferroptosis inducer erastin on myogenic differentiation. Finally, D-PUFAs modulated local expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and muscle-specific protein ligases. Overall, our study suggests a promising role of D-PUFAs as novel therapeutics to protect against skeletal muscle dysfunction induced by oxidative stress.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

The complexity of the socio-ecological contexts in which the mahseer conservation occurs demand an approach integrating behavioural dimensions of the individuals and groups directly or indirectly involved in it and social and cultural values they hold for these fishes with the conservation planning and implementation processes for better results. This study examined different facets of the mahseer conservation across three environmentally, geographically, and socio-culturally distinct Indian states - Karnataka, Assam, and Uttarakhand under a framework integrating Conservation Planning Framework (CPF) with the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Social Values (SV). Across all the focal states, three key themes were constructed - consensus between stakeholders, communication and collaboration, and values and moral responsibility. Our analyses revealed that while shared ecological concerns offered an opportunity for the collective conservation actions, inter-stakeholder conflicts, communication gaps, hesitation to collaborate, top-down governance, and restricted decision-making autonomy available to tribal and local communities acted as the barriers. Stakeholders from all three states demonstrated strong pro conservation attitudes, moral responsibility, perceived capability to implement the conservation plans and culturally embedded value for mahseer, rooted in religious beliefs, tribal and local identities and recreational traditions. However, on ground analysis revealed a low actual behavioural control amongst many stakeholders limiting translation of the positive elements present in their attitudes and values into tangible conservation outcomes. Our observations emphasise formalising community-based co-management, strengthening inter-departmental coordination, building conservation capacity, adopting socio-culturally grounded communication strategies and repositioning community fishing events as socio-ecological heritage to ensure stakeholder compliance of the existing mahseer conservation plans and improve its success. Furthermore, aligning conservation planning with behavioural drivers and social values could offer more vital insights for formulating inclusive strategies and policies for protecting mahseers and managing their habitats.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Our findings revealed a novel protein-protein interaction between NSP15 and the host keratin type II cytoskeletal 1 in Vero E6 cells, as determined by mass spectrometry, and subsequently validated by immunoprecipitation. We observed that when NSP15 was delivered into Vero E6 cells, the fibrous network of keratin intermediate filaments was disrupted, and the nuclear structure was lost. This disruption of the keratin cytoskeleton was then shown to cause a statistically significant reduction in cell viability of Vero E6 cells.

Therefore, it is paramount to understand how this family of viruses evades cellular antiviral responses and establishes productive infection. The conserved coronavirus non-structural protein (nsp)1 has been shown to inhibit host protein synthesis and promote host mRNA degradation while viral mRNAs are protected. We showed previously that SARS-CoV-2 induces activation of host integrated stress response (ISR) kinases PKR and PERK, which promote phosphorylation of eIF and consequent inhibition of host protein synthesis. In contrast, eIF2 remains unphosphorylated during MERS-CoV infection. To investigate the interactions of nsp1 and the ISR kinases, we utilized recombinant SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV expressing nsp1 with mutations in each of two conserved domains. Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 mutants, translation was shut down in wildtype (WT) and PKR knockout (KO) cells but rescued in PERK KO cells, likely due to reduced p-eIF2. In contrast, translation was rescued during infection with the analogous MERS-CoV nsp1 mutants even in WT cells. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 WT suppressed expression of GADD34, a negative regulator of eIF2 phosphorylation, while SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 mutants induced GADD34. In contrast MERS-CoV WT induced GADD34. Utilizing single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV nsp1 promote host mRNA degradation during WT, but not nsp1 mutant, infection. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 WT suppressed stress granule formation, nsp1 mutants induced stress granules containing host RNA.

The cytoplasm of fiber cells in the lens core becomes increasingly oxidizing with age, allowing non-native disulfides to drive light-scattering aggregation of {gamma}-crystallins. Despite this vulnerability to non-native disulfides, and despite lacking any native-state disulfides, {gamma}-crystallins are unexpectedly Cys-rich. To understand this paradox, we investigated how replacing all four Cys residues in the aggregation-prone N-terminal domain of {gamma}D-crystallin affects its stability and aggregation. Cys removal precludes the disulfide-driven aggregation pathway we reported previously. Here, we characterize two full-length human {gamma}D-crystallin variants: C18S/C32S/C41S/C78S (NCS) and C18T/C32A/C41A/C78A (NCA/T). Thermodynamic and kinetic stability measurements indicate the N-terminal domain was greatly destabilized in both variants relative to WT, with NCS more destabilized than NCA/T. Upon mild heating or partial denaturation, both variants formed light-scattering aggregates, which were amorphous by transmission electron microscopy. Surprisingly, the aggregation proceeded exclusively from a native-state dimer held together by a C-terminal disulfide bridge. Aggregation was strongly suppressed by the lens native chemical chaperone, myo-inositol. The aggregation rate depended linearly on protein concentration, indicating that the rate limiting step was a transformation of the native-state dimer to a misfolded dimer. The native-state dimer forms readily even in the WT protein, and evidence of it has been found in the lens. We propose that many age-related chemical modifications could destabilize the native fold of human {gamma}D-crystallin, favor misfolding within its native-state dimer, and thereby cause aggregation.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

B.; Sun, M.; Wu, X.; Wang, J.; Wan, S.", "abstract": "As the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States, pancreatic cancer (PaC) is a highly heterogenous malignancy that can be divided into a multitude of potential subtypes, with the main 4 consisting of aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX), immunogenic, progenitor, and squamous. Each PaC subtype is characterized by their unique molecular pathways and therapeutic characteristics. Identifying PaC molecular subtypes is essential for downstream patient risk stratification and tailored treatment design. Conventional wet-lab approaches for PaC subtyping like microdissection, histopathological studies or molecular profiling are often laborious, costly and time-consuming. To address these concerns, we present MetaPaCS, a novel meta-learning framework to accurately identify PaC subtypes based on transcriptomics data only. Specifically, after preprocessing, the transcriptome-based feature vectors were classified by 10 base machine learning (ML) classifiers, whose prediction outputs were then combined with the initial preprocessed feature vectors to constitute a new set of ensemble feature vectors for a meta-learning model. Our meta-learning model could learn and leverage the diversity of different base classifiers to boost the prediction performance beyond any single ML model. Results based on 100 times ten-fold cross validation tests on benchmarking datasets demonstrated that MetaPaCS performed significantly better than existing state-of-the-art methods for PaC subtyping. In addition, our meta-learning model remarkably outperformed each individual base classifier, demonstrating that MetaPaCS could combine diverse results from multiple base classifiers to boost the ensemble performance. We believe that MetaPaCS is a promising tool for characterizing PaC subtypes and will have positive impacts on downstream risk stratification and personalized treatment design for PaC patients.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that pathogenic versus commensal bacteria differentially rewire host autophagy networks to either promote or inhibit OSCC progression. To test this, we constructed host-bacterium autophagy interactomes from KEGG, STRING, and curated databases, identifying key network hubs (e.g., MAPK1, STAT3) via graph-theoretic metrics. We then applied a hierarchical unsupervised machine learning pipeline, combining two-stage principal component analysis with permutation testing and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), to interrogate differences in network topology. This multi-layer approach revealed a clear separation between pro-cancer (pathogenic) and anti-cancer (commensal) bacterial network signatures, with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis emerging as dominant global outliers. Pathogenic taxa activated inflammatory-metabolic autophagy signatures (e.g., NFKB1, MYC, ACACA), whereas commensals stabilized kinase-homeostasis signaling (EGFR, PTEN, HSP90AA1). Permutation testing confirmed that these network differences were highly significant and non-random (p < 0.001). We also derived a Dysbiosis Index that robustly distinguished the pro- versus anti-cancer bacterial cohorts with high predictive power.

Disruption of these processes compromises neuronal differentiation and survival, and various neurotoxic compounds, including certain pesticides, have been associated with such dysfunctions. In this context, identifying molecules that counteract these detrimental effects is of significant therapeutic interest. Neuronal polarization is essential for the establishment of functional neural circuits and relies on coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, RhoA/ROCK signaling, and mitochondrial function. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective and neurorestorative potential of the ganglioside GM1 and its oligosaccharide derivative, osGM1, in primary hippocampal pyramidal neurons exposed to the mitochondrial neurotoxin rotenone. Rotenone induced a marked arrest of neuronal development, impaired axonal elongation, and disrupted mitochondrial organization and membrane potential. Both GM1 and osGM1 promoted recovery of neuronal polarity and axonal growth, exerting protective and restorative effects even under continuous toxin exposure, with osGM1 showing superior efficacy. Notably, osGM1 also reversed axonal growth deficits caused by pathological actin stabilization. Mechanistically, osGM1 normalized rotenone-induced hyperactivation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway without altering basal signaling and partially restored mitochondrial network integrity and function. Collectively, these findings identify osGM1 as a multi-target modulator of cytoskeletal and mitochondrial dysfunction and support its translational potential as a therapeutic strategy to counteract neurotoxin-induced neuronal damage.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

To better understand this, we investigated a knock-in (KI) mouse model carrying the p.R15L mutation in the endogenous protein. Unlike previously described mutant D10 KI models, p.R15L KI mice exhibited normal D10 protein levels, with no evidence of large protein aggregates. Mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide emission in mitochondria isolated from muscle and brain were unaltered. Similarly, fibroblasts from human p.R15L carriers exhibited normal D10 levels and unchanged oxidative phosphorylation function. Histochemical analyses of p.R15L KI muscle revealed mild increases in mitochondrial enzymatic activity in a subset of muscle fibers and muscle transcriptomics showed elevated expression of PGC-1, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. p.R15L KI mice developed subtle, late-onset phenotypes, including reduced body weight and motor activity and increased anxiety-like behavior. Importantly, in aged mice electrophysiological studies demonstrated decreased amplitude of the compound muscle action potential, commensurate with a moderate loss of spinal cord motor neurons and elevated serum neurofilament light levels, indicative of neurodegeneration. Together, these results indicate that the p.R15L mutation produces a mild, late-onset motor neuron phenotype in mice, partially recapitulating the human disease, without mitochondrial functional or morphological alterations. The findings indicate that p.R15L D10 selectively impairs mouse motor neurons through a gain-of-function mechanism, providing a genetically accurate yet mild in vivo model of familial ALS.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Anti-HSP70 decoy antibodies potently and effector-independently inhibit growth and survival of both murine and human melanoma cells and suppress key transcriptional programs involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal dynamics, and metabolism. In a preclinical B16 melanoma model, prophylactic administration of decoy monoclonal antibodies Mel322-34 and Mel321-35 conferred significant survival benefits of 27% and 48%, respectively.

Here, we performed an extensive phylogenomic and metabolic analysis of Dermatophilaceae PAOs utilizing 46 newly recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a laboratory-scale EBPR reactor treating high-strength wastewater and full-scale wastewater treatment plants. These analyses revealed a previously uncharacterized PAO genus, named Candidatus Dermatophostum, which is adapted to high-phosphorus environments. Its representative species, Ca.

E.; Semina, E. V.; Pankratova, E. D.; Kurinnaia, O. S.; Guldan, E. V.; Abasov, E. H.; Iourov, I. Y.; Chaika, Y. A.", "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) represent a heterogeneous group of conditions affecting the central nervous system, the etiology of which involves a wide range of factors, including genetic contributors. A proportion of this genetic component is mediated by copy number variations (CNVs) - deletions and duplications of genomic segments that are associated with a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. In recent years, there has also been growing interest in studying Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) in relation to these disorders. HARs are highly conserved genomic elements across mammals that have accumulated human-specific sequence changes. These regions are thought to contribute both to the evolution of higher cognitive functions in humans and, paradoxically, to an increased susceptibility to NDDs. Thus, both HARs and CNVs are expected to play key roles in the genetic architecture and pathogenesis of NDDs. However, despite active research on HARs and CNVs separately, integrative studies examining copy-number-driven disruptions specifically within HARs in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders have been extremely limited. This is the first study to assess the contribution of CNVs affecting HARs in 821 children with NDDs. Our bioinformatic evaluation of CNV profiles in this clinical cohort demonstrated that HARs are indeed susceptible to structural alterations in the form of deletions and duplications, supporting the notion that CNVs have shaped the evolution of these regions. Our findings further indicate that HARs, overall, are less frequently affected by duplications compared to other genomic regions. We identified three recurrent HAR loci most strongly associated with neurodevelopmental impairment: HAR_Merge50-02702, HAR_Merge50-02080, and HAR_Merge50-02689. Additionally, we found that HARs disrupted by CNVs form coordinated functional clusters corresponding to genomic regions that harbor extremely rare or entirely absent CNVs in the general population (e.g., HARs associated with RBFOX1, DOC2B, ZMYND11, AFF2, OPHN1). These same genes exhibit a high haploinsufficiency index (HI = 3) according to ClinGen, highlighting their dosage sensitivity. Analysis of the most frequently affected HARs confirmed that their associated genes are significantly enriched for core NDD phenotypes. The absence of a direct correlation with genomic instability suggests that HARs represent functionally vulnerable elements and that compensatory mechanisms may restrict the accumulation of additional structural damage in these regions. Taken together, our study reinforces the importance of HARs in the evolution and functioning of the human central nervous system and provides new evidence supporting the functional relevance of HAR-associated disruptions in neurodevelopmental disorders. We anticipate that future research will further elucidate the complex regulatory processes within the genome and help identify specific HAR regions that may be informative for diagnostic purposes and the development of targeted therapeutic approaches.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

While ESCs and undifferentiated HC11 cells were characterized by pathways associated with pluripotency and oncogenic signalling, the pregnancy like priming stage showed enrichment in, neurotrophin signalling. Crucially, the lactation like state was dominated by PI3K Akt and mTOR signalling critical drivers of epithelial proliferation and milk synthesis.

IKAROS restoration reprograms chromatin accessibility and transcriptional control, shifting regulation from an ETS-dominated state to one enriched for B-cell lineage factors.

At 60 mg/kg/d, EGME exposure altered the proportion of sperm small RNA reads mapped to different small RNA categories and the distribution of read lengths. Because there is evidence that small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) in sperm regulate embryonic development, we analyzed sperm sncRNA data from EGME-treated male rats to identify differential expression at the individual RNA level. EGME treatment resulted in dose-dependent increases in the expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs), piRNAs, and tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). We identified 12 miRNAs that were differentially expressed at all EGME doses, with a monotonic, dose-dependent increase. High-confidence targets of these 12 miRNAs are known to be expressed in pre-implantation embryos and statistically enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes related to early development, such as cell fate commitment and regulation of developmental growth.

Using primary human monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and sepsis patients, we demonstrate that P7-Pen enhances cytokine production in response to Toll-like receptor stimulation while having minimal effects under basal conditions.

The structures also provide an explanation for the preference of the STING oligomer to different PIPs. Mutational and biochemical analyses confirm the binding modes of PIPs and cholesterol and their roles in STING activation. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanisms of STING by specific lipids, which may underlie the role of intracellular compartment trafficking in dictating STING signaling.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

L.; Michel, K.", "abstract": "Mosquitoes vector multiple disease-causing pathogens detrimental to humans, imposing a high public health and economic burden. Chemical and biological larvicides are used in some settings to reduce mosquito populations as a supplement to adult population control. In this study, we assessed the larvicidal potential of a newly isolated strain of the hypocrealean fungus, Clonostachys rosea, by modifying a previously established laboratory-based experimental design. This design allowed us to distinguish between the larvicidal impact of the fungal culture supernatant and conidia. Our data show that C. rosea efficiently kills larvae of the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, at an LC50 of 7.78 x 106 for culture supernatant and 7.13 x 107 conidia/mL for washed conidia. Fungal culture supernatant retained over 95% of its activity upon autoclaving, suggesting a temperature stable non-proteinaceous mycotoxin is responsible for larvicidal activity in the supernatant. Conidia were readily ingested, remained in the gut lumen, and did not germinate or translocate to the ectoperitrophic space nor the hemocoel. UV and heat-killed conidia retained larvicidal activity, demonstrating that no active secretion of toxins, fungal growth, or infection is required for killing mosquito larvae. However, autoclaving conidia abolished larvicidal activity, suggesting that larvae may not be killed via a mechanical mechanism, such as occlusion. Instead, our data demonstrate that C. rosea conidia kill An. gambiae larvae via the passive release of intracellular mycotoxins and have potential as a fungal biolarvicide to control An. gambiae populations.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Systemic hormones play a key role in coordinating this balance, yet how they regulate cell death in vivo remains unclear. Here, we investigate hormone-regulated cell death in a metabolically specialised tissue using Drosophila hepatocyte-like cells, known as oenocytes, as a tractable in vivo model. Through non-invasive longitudinal live imaging combined with oenocyte-specific genetic manipulation, we directly visualise larval oenocyte death during metamorphosis. We show that larval oenocyte loss is a dynamic, multistep process that is controlled by the steroid hormone ecdysone. We further identify the ecdysone-induced nuclear receptor E75 as a key regulator of cell death timing, as loss of E75 triggers premature oenocyte death. Oenocyte-specific manipulation of cell death pathways, together with live imaging using genetically encoded caspase reporters, provides direct evidence that larval oenocytes die by apoptosis. Together, this work defines how systemic hormonal signals regulate the timing of apoptosis in metabolically active cells, and establishes oenocytes as a powerful in vivo system for studying metabolic cell death.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Yet, these same organisms do not develop stem cell driven cancers. Here, we explored if the regenerative flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea has evolved mechanisms to modulate regeneration depending on underlying DNA damage or neoplastic risk. We first challenged worms to regenerate after increasing doses of ionizing radiation and found that even sublethal doses (500-1250Rads) transiently inhibit regeneration. After amputation, stem cells could divide and accumulate near injuries but did not increase proliferation rates in response to amputation or restore missing tissues. By leveraging published single cell sequencing datasets, we found that ionizing radiation increased activin ligand expression, particularly in the intestine. RNAi knockdown of 18 different activin signaling homologs identified activin ligands, activin receptors, and downstream Smad transcription factors whose depletion partially or fully rescued regenerative capacity after radiation. Notably, depletion of activin-2 did not alter radiation-induced stem cell loss. Instead, it increased stem cell expansion and amputation-induced proliferation, fully restoring regeneration despite prior DNA damage and depleted stem cell numbers. Together, our results indicate that Activin signaling levels are a central regulator of planarian stem cell behaviors, coordinating shifts between repair of pre-existing tissues following systemic damage, homeostatic tissue turnover, and whole-body regeneration. Moreover, Activin signaling may function as a conserved tumor suppressor in Schmidtea mediterranea by inhibiting stem-cell driven regeneration when damage levels are too high.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "The tiny and enormously abundant marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus contains many levels of population structure, with sequenced isolates spanning four orders of magnitude of diversity. It is divided into several major clades which exhibit the classic structure of distinct species, with little gene exchange across clade boundaries. The diversity within the dominant clade, High Light II (HLII), exceeds that of many bacterial species but exhibits little global population structure beyond some small tight genomic clusters. Few ecological distinctions within HLII have been found. What causes and sustains for millions of years the extensive diversity of this globally mixed population? In this work, hundreds of single cell genomes are analyzed and used to elucidate patterns of core and flexible gene flow, delineate subtle geographical correlations, and quantitatively test several scenarios for the evolutionary history of HLII. We find that recombination connects the entire HLII clade and that genes more than a few kb apart along the genome evolve largely independently. On shorter timescales, primarily-asexual blooms occur, but the clonal backbones of the resulting closely-related cell clusters are steadily eroded by recombination with the rest of HLII. Although a small number of genes have ocean-specific alleles, there is no evidence for genetically-stable ecotypes within the clade. We conjecture that spatio-temporally variable selection drives conditionally-beneficial variants of genomic segments to rise to high abundance while horizontally-transferring throughout the population.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Cytosolic DNA exposure triggers innate immune responses through cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) [1-3]. Upon binding to DNA, cGAS is activated to produce cGAMP, which functions as a second messenger that binds to stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized signaling adaptor [3-5]. STING then traffics from the ER to the Golgi, leading to activation of the kinases TBK1 and IKK and subsequent induction of interferons and other cytokines [6-10]. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P2] is an endogenous ligand of STING that functions together with cGAMP to induce STING activation. Proteomics analysis identified a constitutive interaction between STING and PIKfyve, an enzyme that produces PtdIns(3,5)P2 in mammalian cells. Deletion of PIKfyve blocked STING trafficking from the ER and TBK1 activation. In vitro reconstitution revealed a strong and selective effect of PtdIns(3,5)P2 on STING activation. Purified STING bound directly to PtdIns(3,5)P2 in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Consistently, PtdIns(3,5)P2 promoted cGAMP-induced STING oligomerization by binding to a groove between STING dimers as revealed by cryo-EM (Li et al., co-submitted). Similar to PIKfyve depletion, mutation of the PtdIns(3,5)P2-binding residues in STING blocked its trafficking and downstream signaling. These results reveal PtdIns(3,5)P2 as a lipid ligand of STING with essential roles in innate immunity.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Archetype analysis is an alternative analysis approach that identifies a minimal convex hull enclosing all data points in a dimensionally-reduced space, such as PCA space. The points of this convex manifold, or hull, each represent theoretical extremal states specialized in a subset of functions that are mutually exclusive to the extremal states found at each other vertex. The transition between two points represents a Pareto front of tradeoffs between potential cell states. Cell distances from each archetype and direction between archetypes then carry interpretable biological information revealing features of resource tradeoffs in cell state regulation. The archetypal points themselves are theoretical pure extremal states rarely accessed by real cells, which instead display a combination of archetype weights/mixture coefficients representing a mixture of specializations. By characterizing the relationships between gene expression and archetype distance, archetypal analysis can identify the phenotypic features of theoretically pure specialist states, the phenotypic tradeoffs of real cells, and the boundaries of accessible cell states in the analyzed sample. Here we present Python Encoders for Archetypal Convex Hulls (PEACH), a new PyTorch-based archetype analysis package compatible with the scVerse ecosystem that recapitulates and extends features available in previous archetype analysis packages. This includes a hyperparameter search function to identify the best $k$ archetypes that fit an input dataset. PEACH uses a deliberately constrained autoencoder architecture to directly learn an archetypal latent space, replacing previous alternating least squares methods with a highly performant, GPU-accelerated archetype analysis method that is scalable to modern scRNAseq datasets of hundreds of thousands of cells. Crucially, PEACH includes automated hyperparameter search with cross-validation to identify optimal archetype and initialization configurations, enabling users to implement archetype analysis without extensive manual hyperparameter optimization and testing.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

In epileptic mice, selective inhibition of CA2 PCs reduces chronic seizures. Here we asked if activating CA2 PCs increases seizures. Mice expressing Cre recombinase in CA2 PCs (Amigo2-Cre mice) were injected with the convulsant pilocarpine to induce a period of severe seizures (status epilepticus, SE), which leads to chronic seizures after 3-4 weeks (epilepsy). Epileptic mice were injected with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) to express an excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (eDREADD; hM3Dq) in dorsal CA2 bilaterally and implanted with subdural EEG electrodes. After recovery, mice were recorded continuously using video and EEG for 6 weeks, 3 weeks with drinking water containing the eDREADD activator clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and 3 weeks without CNO. CA2 activation with CNO caused a significant increase in seizure frequency and duration. Seizures occurred in clusters (many seizures per day over several consecutive days) and mice given water with CNO had a greater maximum number of seizures per day during a cluster compared to water without CNO. CNO had no significant effect in control mice. In naive Amigo2-Cre mice expressing hM3Dq, pre-treatment with CNO before pilocarpine administration shortened the latency to SE and increased EEG power at the start of SE. Taken together with prior findings, the results suggest that CA2 is a control point for regulating seizures in the pilocarpine mouse model of TLE.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

Although approved pharmacotherapies often reduce tic severity, they frequently cause adverse effects and are insufficient for managing comorbid symptoms, underscoring the need for improved treatments. Recent evidence indicates that the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) antagonist pimavanserin reduces tic severity and improves quality of life, yet its mechanism of action in TS remains unclear. Here, we combine postmortem human and preclinical approaches to gain insight into the role of 5-HT2ARs in TS. Western-blot analyses of postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples obtained from individuals with TS revealed a pronounced, male-specific elevation of 5-HT2AR protein levels in Brodmann Area (BA) 10. We then tested pimavanserin and the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist volinanserin in two mouse models of TS: D1CT-7 transgenic mice and mice with early-life depletion of striatal cholinergic interneurons. Systemic administration of pimavanserin (1-2 mg/kg, IP) or volinanserin (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, IP) robustly reduced tic-like movements and stereotypies in both models. Local infusion of pimavanserin into the medial PFC, but not the dorsal striatum, recapitulated these effects, indicating a cortical locus of action. Pimavanserin also reduced resident-intruder aggression, but not locomotion or anxiety-like behavior. Together, these findings identify elevated prefrontal 5-HT2ARs as a key mechanistic contributor to TS and a promising therapeutic target for individuals with TS and pathological aggression.", "date": "2025-12-29", "journal": ""}

We used cell type-specific LysoIP to perform tandem-mass-tag mass-spectrometry and detected distinct aberrant proteomic signatures in progranulin-deficient astrocytes, neurons, and microglia, indicating cell type-specific dysregulation of key lysosomal proteins with crucial functions in sphingolipid metabolism and lysosome organization. These proteins markedly differed from progranulin-deficient RNAseq data sets, suggesting progranulin regulates lysosomal composition through post-translational mechanisms including the sorting of nascent proteins to the lysosome. Validation experiments confirmed that Mfsd8 and Ppt1, proteins whose mutation on their own cause NCL, were essentially absent from progranulin-deficient neuronal and microglial lysosomes, respectively.
