How stability is maintained in such relationships remains, however, poorly understood, and can only be fully understood by integrating processes across both micro- and macroevolutionary scales. In this study, we bridge these scales by examining the symbiotic communities of gutless marine oligochaetes - annelid worms that have become obligately dependent on their bacterial partners for nutrition and waste removal over the past 150 million years. Using metagenomic sequencing of 231 individuals from 63 host species, collected across 17 marine environments worldwide, we reconstructed host and symbiont phylogenies to investigate the composition, specificity, and evolutionary history of their symbiotic communities from the strain to genus level. Our results show that each gutless oligochaete harbors up to 10 symbiont species drawn from a restricted pool of 33 marine bacterial genera. Community composition was strongly shaped by host species at 90% explanatory power, and much less by geography or environment. Symbiont communities were highly stable within host species but shifted rapidly at short macroevolutionary scales as host species diverged. Ancestral state reconstructions revealed that the primary symbiont, Candidatus Thiosymbion, was an early and persistent acquisition, while secondary symbionts were gained multiple times through convergent evolution, enhancing the diversity and metabolic flexibility of the symbiotic communities. By linking fine-scale microevolutionary dynamics with broader macroevolutionary patterns, our study reveals how gutless oligochaetes achieve both stability and flexibility in their symbiotic partnerships - enabling long-term host dependency while driving innovation and adaptation. This evolutionary trajectory may underpin the ecological success and diversification of gutless oligochaetes in marine sediments, and may help explain the repeated emergence and persistence of other multipartite associations.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Although genetic factors are implicated, mechanistic understanding has been hindered by the lack of suitable animal models. Here, we describe a medaka (Oryzias latipes) mutant, generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis, that develops IA during embryogenesis. Positional cloning identified a nonsense mutation in mypt1, encoding myosin phosphatase target subunit 1. Mutant embryos exhibited ectopic accumulation of F-actin and phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain (Mrlc) in the intestinal epithelium, consistent with disrupted actomyosin regulation. These cytoskeletal abnormalities were accompanied by epithelial disorganisation without notable alterations in cell proliferation, motility, or apoptosis. Inhibition of myh11a, encoding smooth muscle (SM) myosin heavy chain, ameliorated the IA phenotype but Blebbistatin treatment completely rescued the defect, suggesting a non-contractile role prior to SM maturation. Together, these findings demonstrate that mypt1 loss disrupts intestinal morphogenesis through actomyosin dysregulation. Given the recent clinical identification of IA associated with MYPT1 mutations, this medaka model offers a valuable platform to investigate the developmental and molecular basis of MYPT1-associated IA in human.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "The actions of animals provide a window into how their minds work. Recent advances in deep learning are providing powerful approaches to recognize patterns of animal movement from video recordings using markerless pose estimation models. There is an increasingly rich field of unsupervised and supervised methods for classifying animal behavior built upon the outputs of pose estimation models. However, these methods often rely on species and task-specific feature engineering of trajectories, kinematics and task programming. Highly generalized solutions that use only pose estimations and the inherent structure of animals and their environment provide an opportunity to develop foundational, contextual and, importantly, standardized animal behavior models for efficient and reproducible behavioral analysis. Here, we present PoseRecognition (PoseR), a behavioral classifier leveraging action recognition models using spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks. We show that it can be used to classify animal behavior quickly and accurately from pose estimations, using zebrafish larvae, Drosophila melanogaster, mice, and rats as model organisms. PoseR can be accessed using a Napari plugin, which facilitates efficient behavioral extraction for bout-like behaviour, annotation, model training and deployment. Our tool simplifies the behavioral analysis workflow by transforming coordinates of animal position and pose into semantic labels with speed and precision. Furthermore, we contribute a novel method for unsupervised clustering of behaviors and provide open-source access to our zebrafish datasets and models. The design of our tool ensures scalability and versatility for use across multiple species and contexts, improving the efficiency of behavioral analysis across fields.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

This is expected to improve swimming speed and directionality. Here, we found that deletion of cetZ1 or expression of a GTPase-defective mutant caused a substantial defect in the assembly of the motility machinery, including the archaellum base marker protein ArlD1, the chemotaxis sensory array adapter CheW1, and signal transducer CheY. Furthermore, overexpression of cetZ1 reduced the assembly and polar placement of the motility machinery without detectably affecting the rod shape of motile cells. In contrast, deletion of the conserved paralog cetZ2 caused no defects in swimming or rod shape, although expression of the cetZ2 GTPase-defective mutant reduced motility whereas cetZ2 overexpression caused mild hyper-motility; these effects were dependent on the presence of cetZ1. A functional CetZ1-mTq2 fusion strongly localized at the poles of mature motile cells, where it partially co-localized with the motility machinery markers. These results suggest that CetZ1 has another role in the organisation or structure of the cell poles that promotes the assembly of the motility machinery. The multiple roles and locations of CetZ1 during motile cell development are reminiscent of the multiple functions of eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

This study looked into the impact of chronic exposure to mobile phone radiation, coupled with glutathione supplementation, on serum lipid profiles and body weight in mice-a subject vital for understanding potential health risks in humans and animals respectively. Thirty-five male mice were divided into seven groups, each subjected to various mobile phone modes and glutathione treatments. Over five weeks, these mice were exposed to 300 missed calls daily, simulating real-world exposure scenarios. Different serum lipid parameters-triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-were monitored and observed throughout the study period. Remarkably, triglycerides, cholesterol, and LDL levels exhibited no noteworthy statistical variances compared to the control group or among experimental cohorts exposed to diverse range of mobile phone radiation modes or glutathione supplements. However, we noted some little deviations in HDL levels, particularly in the silent and silent+glutathione groups. Moreover, we also noted an unexpected result in weight loss across all groups by week three, which was pronounced by week five, and notably pronounced in the glutathione-administered cohorts. This outcome hints at glutathione's complex role in mitigating some complications of mobile phone radiation exposure. In conclusion, the study suggests a potential interplay between glutathione supplementation, mobile phone radiation exposure, and HDL levels in mice-an avenue ripe for further exploration into the understanding of cellular response to modern technological exposures.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Utilizing transcriptomic profiling, assessments of chromatin accessibility, mitochondrial phenotyping, and lipidomics analyses, we observed that SC-{beta} cells exhibit reduced oxidative and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism compared to primary human islets that are related to limitations in key mitochondrial transcriptional networks. Surprisingly, we found that reductions in glucose-stimulated mitochondrial respiration in SC-islets were not associated with alterations in mitochondrial mass, structure, or genome integrity. In contrast, SC-islets show limited expression of targets of PPAR, which regulate mitochondrial programming, yet whose functions in {beta} cell differentiation are unknown. Importantly, treatment with WY14643, a potent PPAR agonist, induced expression of mitochondrial targets, improved insulin secretion, and increased the formation of SC-{beta} cells both in vitro and following transplantation.

Assembly of TopBP1, a multifunctional scaffolding protein, into condensates is required to amplify ATR kinase activity to the levels needed to coordinate the DNA damage response and manage DNA replication stress. Many ATR inhibitors are tested for cancer treatment in clinical trials, but their overall effectiveness is often compromised by the emergence of resistance and toxicities. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose to disrupt the ATR pathway by targeting TopBP1 condensation. First, we screened a molecule-based library using a previously developed optogenetic approach and identified several TopBP1 condensation inhibitors. Amongst them, AZD2858 disrupted TopBP1 assembly induced by the clinically relevant topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38, thereby inhibiting the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway. We found that AZD2858 exerted its effects by disrupting TopBP1 self-interaction and binding to ATR in mammalian cells, and by increasing its chromatin recruitment in cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extracts. Moreover, AZD2858 prevented S-phase checkpoint induction by SN-38, leading to increased DNA damage and apoptosis in a colorectal cancer cell line. Lastly, AZD2858 showed synergistic effect in combination with the FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen in a spheroid model of colorectal cancer.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

The current study used the peripheral object discrimination task, 7T fMRI, and MEG to isolate feedback from feedforward signals in human early visual cortex. The results showed that feedback signals conveyed both low-order features natively encoded in early visual cortex and high-order features generated in high-level regions, but with different spatial and temporal properties. The high-order feedback information targeted both superficial and deep layers, whereas the low-order feedback information reached only deep layers in V1. In addition, MEG results revealed that the feedback information from occipito-temporal to early visual cortex emerged around 200 ms after stimulus onset, and only the representational strength of high-order feedback information was significantly correlated with behavioral performance.

However, in many organisms and cell types, the mechanisms by it does so are not well understood. Here, we identify the exocytotic protein KEULE, an essential SEC/MUNC, as a dynamic marker for exocytosis that forms clusters that are associated with and required for discrete exocytotic events in growing Arabidopsis cells. Live cell imaging revealed that these clusters, including those associated with verified exocytotic events, have stereotyped and distinct patterns of protein accumulate and loss, suggesting discreet phases in the assembly, function and of exocytotic protein complexes. Super-resolution image analysis revealed that exocytotic events marked by these KEULE clusters are not randomly distributed at the plasma membrane but are significantly enriched in ~180 nm wide linear domains that flank cortical microtubules associated with the plasma membrane, while being under-represented in adjacent domains ~520 nm wide. Thus, the cortical microtubule array acts as a highly organized and dynamic two-dimensional template that effectively redistributes and patterns a significant portion of exocytotic traffic. This positioning mechanism differs from previously reported mechanisms based on directed transport to microtubule ends, allowing for linear and ordered deposition of cargoes to the cell membrane and extracellular matrix to support functions such as cell morphogenesis. The role microtubule arrays near or at the plasma membrane play in organizing exocytosis may be conserved in other cell types and organisms.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

The inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity of GBM presents significant obstacles to effective clinical progression of novel treatments by contributing to tumour plasticity and rapid drug resistance that confounds contemporary target directed drug discovery strategies. Phenotypic drug screening is ideally suited to heterogeneous diseases, where targeting specific oncogenic drivers have been broadly ineffective. Our hypothesis is that a modern phenotypic led approach using disease relevant patient-derived GBM stem cell systems will be the most productive approach to identifying new therapeutic targets, drug classes and future drug combinations that target the heterogeneity of GBM. In this study we incorporate a panel of patient-derived GBM stem cell lines into an automated and unbiased Cell Painting assay to quantify multiple GBM stem cell phenotypes. By screening several compound libraries at multiple concentrations across a panel of patient-derived GBM stem cells we provide the first comprehensive survey of distinct pharmacological classes and known druggable targets, including all clinically approved drug classes and oncology drug candidates upon multiple GBM stem cell phenotypes linked to cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Our data set representing, 3866 compounds, 2.2million images and 64000 datapoints is the largest phenotypic screen carried out to date on a panel of patient-derived GBM stem cell models that we are aware of.

By directly measuring the mechanical coupling between a cardiac cell and an artificial mechanical cell and monitoring the dependence of beat-to-beat variability on mechanical coupling, we can quantify the sensitivity of cardiac cells to mechanical signals. Here we show that due to the dynamic viscoelastic properties of collagen hydrogels (a major component of the cardiac ECM), the shape of the mechanical signal changes in a frequency-dependent manner as it propagates through the gel, resulting in mechanical communication that depends on beating frequency. Moreover, we show that cardiac cell sensitivity to the shape of the mechanical signal results from its responsiveness to the loading rate, with an optimal loading rate for efficient mechanical communication. The dependence of signal shape on ECM viscoelasticity and the existence of an optimal loading rate suggest that there may be ideal viscoelastic properties for mechanical communication between cardiac cells.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

This mechanistic approach allowed us to uniquely isolate the direct physiological effects of temperature on pupal development from complex colony dynamics and assess individual emergence success, developmental duration, body size, relative lipid content, and wing geometrics morphometrics. At the critical threshold of 38C, pupal emergence was drastically reduced (2-5 fold) and wing deformities increased (4-7 fold). Even excluding wing deformities, we found thermal stress-induced effects on emerged worker wing shape and directional asymmetry.

PBDs mitigation of CMD was associated with improved endothelial nitric oxide synthase function and NO-mediated VSMC signaling, as well as reductions in LV oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling, and fibrosis. PBD altered the gut microbiota, although antibiotic studies failed to establish its importance in ameliorating CMD. Conclusions: A PBD prevented CMD development and reversed established CMD in SHRs. Such benefits of PBD, which occurred without alleviating hypertension, were possibly due to improved endothelial function and likely improved VSMC function. These results support clinical trials to test PBDs in human CMD.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

We proposed that stochastic fluctuations in HIV transcription can appear at, at least, two levels: (1) the chromosomal landscape and (2) the in situ HIV integration site. In the former case, proviruses integrating at different genomic locations demonstrated a variety of transcriptional bursting and can be classified in noise space constructed based on the parameters associated with the coefficient of variation and using a mathematical model fitting a curve of exponential decay. In the latter case, stochastic HIV gene expression tended to be a pure epigenetic phenomenon: the identical provirus demonstrated fluctuations in its transcription with an elevated frequency. We observed similar expression patterns between sense and antisense RNA transcripts. Notably, both HIV long terminal repeats reacted to drug stimulation and may reveal distinct behaviors. Overall, our data suggest that HIV antisense transcripts could be involved in the stochastic nature of HIV transcription.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

In contrast, our brains only require 20W of energy, they learn online, and they can instantly adjust to changing contingencies. This begs the question what data structures, algorithms, and learning methods enable brains to achieve that, and whether these can be ported into artificial devices. We are addressing this question for a core feature of intelligence: The capacity to plan and solve problems, including new problems that involve states which were never encountered before. We examine from the algorithmic perspective three tools that brains are likely to employ for achieving that: Stochastic neural computation, cognitive maps, and compositional coding. We integrate these tools into a transparent neural network model without hidden units, and demonstrate its power for flexible planning and problem solving. Importantly, this approach is suitable for implementation by in-memory computing and other energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it only requires self-supervised local synaptic plasticity that is suited for on-chip learning. Hence a core feature of brain intelligence, the capacity to generate solutions to problems that were never encountered before, does not require deep neural networks or large language models, and can be implemented in energy-efficient edge devices.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Fluorescence microscopy revealed that tonal stimuli with coherent low-frequency patterns enhanced actin polymerization and shmoo formation, both markers of polarity and mating. In contrast, broadband noise disrupted actin integrity, while consonants produced no measurable effects. These results suggest that rhythmic continuity and spectral coherence, key features of speech, can modulate cytoskeletal organization in non-auditory cells.

Multicellular spheroids are increasingly a common model to study GBM invasion and drug response in engineered biomaterials. However, a key design feature of tumor spheroid studies is the size of each spheroid (number of cells, diameter). Given the heterogenous growth of GBM cells at the surgical margin, spheroids of different sizes may also have clinical relevance. Here, we define shifts in behavior and drug response of wild type and temozolomide (TMZ) resistant GBM spheroids as a function of initial spheroid size. GBM spheroids ranging from 100 to 12,000 cells in size were embedded into a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel. GBM spheroid size had an inverse relationship with the number of apoptotic cells. We observed significant spheroid size dependent effects on TMZ efficacy for both TMZ resistant and wild type cells. Interestingly, high single doses of TMZ were more effective in reducing three-dimensional migration from smaller spheroids than metronomic dosing while high single dose and metronomic dosing were equally effective in reducing invasion for large TMZ-resistant spheroids. Our study highlights the importance of considering and reporting spheroid size for cancer tissue engineering studies considering invasion and drug resistance.

It is frequently studied in laboratory settings with the aim of developing effective control strategies. In many experiments, infected plants are placed in direct contact with healthy ones assuming that CMV cannot be transmitted in this way. However, this has not been formally demonstrated. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether CMV can be transmitted through plant-to-plant contact. Infected plants were first rubbed against healthy ones and then left in contact for 28 days. Target plants were subsequently tested using DAS-ELISA to detect potential transmission. We applied this protocol in two separate tests totalizing 15 combinations of plant species including pepper (Capsicum annuum) and five weed species (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Cerastium glomeratum, Stellaria media, Stachys arvensis and Trifolium repens). We found that CMV could be transmitted through contact between pepper and all tested weed species except T.repens.

Cross-linking mass spectrometry and structural modelling with AlphaFold2 reveal a conserved and specific Mer3-RPA interface. Single-molecule magnetic tweezers assays demonstrate that direct RPA interaction is required for Mer3 helicase processivity under conditions of low DNA tension.

Identifying biomarkers of vulnerability and resilience to stress would facilitate a prevention-based approach to mental illness that benefits individuals and reduces healthcare costs. The present study adopted a multivariate machine-learning approach to track neuroimaging biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability following a chronic restraint stress (CRS) model. 96 male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent two sessions of MRI and behavioral tests, before and after CRS. Resilience and vulnerability to CRS were assessed with elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests. Hierarchical clustering was applied to construct brain networks. Partial correlation was used to compute network connectivity. Repeated nested cross validation with a support vector machine was employed to identify rs-fMRI biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability following CRS. No strong group effect size of behavioral changes following CRS was observed within the same animals, suggesting the presence of resilient and vulnerable subgroups. Although the average model performance was modest (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.3 ~ 0.67), baseline functional connectivity across cerebellum, brainstem, striatum, prefrontal and salience-orbitofrontal regions, as well as functional alteration across hippocampus, striatum, prefrontal regions, auditory thalamus, cerebellum, inferior colliculi and brainstem were identified as stable features.

Here, we combined single-molecule footprinting with long-read sequencing to quantify how often chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding co-occur across entire CRLs in the Drosophila genome. Analysis of thousands of individual DNA molecules at each locus revealed that CREs form a specific network with shared single-molecule chromatin accessibility profiles. Co-accessibility is not limited to adjacent CREs, and is frequently observed between CREs brought into proximity by chromatin looping.

Several studies have implicated the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a brainstem nucleus containing a heterogeneous population of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons, in the adaptive stress response and the pathological changes resulting from chronic stress. However, it is not known whether early life chronic stress affects the developing DRN activity, or whether the stress-induced changes affect 5-HT DRN neurons in a subregion- or phenotype-specific manner. To answer these questions, we used in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of 5-HT DRN neurons in larval zebrafish exposed to chronic unpredictable stress during early life. We found that early life chronic stress prevented the normal habituation of the serotonergic system to a repeated acute stressor by altering the balance of excitatory/inhibitory responses within the DRN. Interestingly, these changes were most pronounced in a subset of stress-vulnerable serotonergic cells co-expressing GABAergic markers. Further, using chemogenetic ablation of 5-HT DRN neurons, we showed that stress-induced plasticity of the DRN contributed to changes in startle response habituation and in locomotive activity, but not in anxiety-like behaviors. Collectively, our results emphasize the role of stress-induced plasticity of DRN neurons in the selective regulation of maladaptive behavioral outcomes.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Deficiencies in these protective systems lead to an increased propensity to phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. More recently, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) was identified as a critical ferroptosis inhibitor acting via regeneration of membrane-embedded antioxidants. Yet, regulators of FSP1 are largely uncharacterised, and their identification is essential for understanding the mechanisms buffering phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Here, we conducted a focused CRISPR-Cas9 screen to uncover factors influencing FSP1 function, identifying riboflavin (vitamin B2) as a new modulator of ferroptosis sensitivity. We demonstrate that riboflavin, unlike other vitamins that act as radical-trapping antioxidants, supports FSP1 stability and the recycling of lipid-soluble antioxidants, thereby mitigating phospholipid peroxidation. Furthermore, we show that the riboflavin antimetabolite roseoflavin markedly impairs FSP1 function and sensitises cancer cells to ferroptosis. Thus, we uncover a direct and actionable role for riboflavin in maintaining membrane integrity by promoting membrane tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Our findings provide a rational strategy to modulate the FSP1-antioxidant recycling pathway and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting riboflavin metabolism, with implications for understanding the interaction of nutrients and their contributions to a cell's antioxidant capacity.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

While several proteins with lipid transfer activity have been identified and localized to MCS, their functional significance for supporting physiology is poorly understood. Ceramide transfer protein (CERT) is one such molecule that can transfer ceramide between membranes in vitro. However, evidence for the mechanism and in vivo significance of CERT function is limited. In this study, we have analyzed the function of the only gene (dcert) encoding CERT in Drosophila. We find that loss of function alleles of dcert (dcert1), show elevated levels of short chain ceramide species along with a reduction in the levels of its metabolite phosphatidyl ethanolamine ceramide. Physiological analysis of dcert1 mutant alleles showed reduced electrical responses in the eye to light stimulation although photoreceptors did not undergo retinal degeneration, and this phenotype could be rescued by reconstitution of dcert1 with the wild type gene. The altered light response in dcert1 was associated with a reduction in the rate of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) resynthesis following light induced phospholipase C (PLC) stimulation. The reduced electrical response of dcert1 could be suppressed by reducing ceramide synthesis at the ER. Taken together, our findings suggest that ceramide synthesized at the ER and transferred to the Golgi by CERT regulates G-protein coupled phospholipase C signaling in vivo.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Their functions are mediated by extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, which facilitate adhesive interactions and enable the formation of cis- and trans assemblies at adherens junctions and desmosomes. EC domains adopt a characteristic immunoglobulin-like fold composed of seven {beta} -strands (A-G) and are modified by N -linked and O-linked glycosylations, including O-linked mannose monosaccharides (O-Man) on conserved serine and threonine residues of B- and G-strands. O-Man glycosylations on EC domains are catalyzed by the TMTC1-4 enzymes, with different TMTC enzymes modifying B- or G-strands. Given the site-specific deposition of O-Man glycans by dedicated enzymes and the central role of EC domains in cadherin' functions, we hypothesized that these PTMs may fine-tune cellular adhesion and otherwise contribute to diverse physical interactions that involve cadherins. To test these hypotheses, we assayed for changes in protein-protein interactions formed with epithelial (E)-cadherin in model cells where O-Man were genetically ablated. Herein, we report O-Man-dependent E-cadherin (CDH1) protein interactions, revealed by affinity proteomics, and we orthogonally validate an altered association between CDH1 and CDH3 (P-cadherin).

To uncover regulators of FSP1 abundance, we conducted CRISPR-Cas9 screens utilizing a genome-edited, dual-fluorescent FSP1 reporter cell line, identifying both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that determine FSP1 levels. Notably, we identified riboflavin kinase (RFK) and FAD synthase (FLAD1), enzymes which are essential for synthesizing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) from vitamin B2, as key contributors to FSP1 stability. Biochemical and cellular analyses revealed that FAD binding is critical for FSP1 activity. FAD deficiency, and mutations blocking FSP1-FAD binding, triggered FSP1 degradation via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that involves the E3 ligase RNF8. Unlike other vitamins that inhibit ferroptosis by scavenging radicals, vitamin B2 supports ferroptosis resistance through FAD cofactor binding, ensuring proper FSP1 stability and function.

We addressed this question in a Drosophila model of cancer stem cell-driven tumour which originates during development and grows extensively within a network of cortex glia cells (CG) through adulthood. We found that tumour growth induces progressive remodeling of the CG network and leads to CG apoptosis through cancer stem cell-driven competition, a process which in turn unleashes tumour growth. Notably, preventing CG death reduces tumour growth, revealing a resistance capacity within the CG. Transcriptional profiling of CG cells at different stages revealed a biphasic response, featuring an early specific signature followed by a later collapse of essential cellular functions and pathways, including the conserved JNK pathway. JNK signalling in CG normally plays a neuroprotective role and initially hinders tumour progression, providing resistance.

Through tests using step voltage and sine wave protocols, I discovered clear sensitivity patterns during both the activation and deactivation phases. As expected, forward transitions were most influential during activation, while reverse transitions became more pronounced during deactivation.

Results found significant differences among populations with individuals from western Gulf sites (Louisiana and Alabama) exhibiting strong avoidance of fresh oil, while those from eastern sites (Florida) showed limited or no avoidance. No populations avoided weathered oil. These findings suggest that sensitivity to oil contamination varies regionally, potentially reflecting local exposure histories or environmental adaptation.

Yet, while abundant evidence for self-organization in physical and natural systems exists, there are few adaptive self-organization models that can explain coupled dynamics of human subsistence systems that have also been rigorously validated. Here, we analyze over 18,000 forest patches extracted from 18 remotely-sensed swidden mosaics from tropical and subtropical regions across the planet. We discover a power law signature of adaptive self-organization in the size of the patches and correlation distances that indicate the spatial scale of socioecological adaptation. To explain this pattern, we propose a mathematical model of swidden labor reciprocity, normative reasoning, field placement, forest disturbance and regrowth dynamics that explains the emergent spatial structure of swidden mosaics. Social self-organization can promote sustainable levels of forest disturbance when ecological dynamics such as facilitation, seed-dispersal and competition are conditioned by social dynamics, giving rise to power-law land-use patterns. We use simulations to explore the emergent properties of the model and identify two regimes: deforestation and sustainable swidden. When we analyze the relationship between the simulation results in the remote sensing data, we find that 16/18 of the study areas exhibit power-law distributions and spatial correlation patterns that match the sustainable swidden regime in the model. These findings support the hypothesis that adaptive self-organization may be a general characteristic of coupled human and natural systems.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we describe experimental and computational workflows to address the issues of scale, speed and reproducibility of common in vitro protein testing methods, enabling at least an order of magnitude increase in throughput while reducing wetlab time. Semi-Automated Protein Production (SAPP) is a rapid, modular, scalable and cost-effective protocol, enabling up to milligram-scale protein production, and standardized characterization including yield, dispersity, and oligomeric state of hundreds of designs per day, at the cost-equivalent of a few DNA oligos per construct. End-to-end protocol execution takes 48 hours, with about 6 hours spent benchside using mostly standard laboratory equipment. This protocol has become the standard at our institute, providing critical experimental validation for dozens of projects spanning tens of thousands of designs. Since at least 80% of SAPP's total cost comes from synthetic DNA, we also developed a scalable demultiplexing protocol (DMX) to leverage oligo pools as input DNA, providing a further 5-fold reduction in costs, enabling >1000 designs to be purified and characterized in arrayed, clonal format at a cost of $5 per construct. By reframing standard molecular biology practices and orchestrating wetlab workflows with partial automation instead of complex end-to-end robotics, these protocols should be widely adoptable, accelerating protein design.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Although traditional ligand-based and structure-based approaches have facilitated the development of effective therapeutics for many GPCRs, these approaches often fall short when applied to receptors with limited ligand or structural data. This limitation highlights the critical need for advanced strategies capable of accurately predicting ligand bioactivity across the entire GPCR family, especially for understudied receptor subtypes. In this study, we introduce BOLD-GPCRs (BERT-Optimized Ligand Discovery for GPCRs), a deep learning framework designed to enhance the prediction of ligand bioactivity across class A GPCRs. Accessible via a user-friendly web interface, BOLD-GPCRs employs transfer learning and leverages curated datasets of known class A GPCR ligands, receptor sequences, and signaling-relevant mutations. By integrating dense neural network classifiers with transformer-based protein language models, BOLD-GPCRs captures complex relationships between receptor sequence/function and ligand activity. Our results demonstrate that BOLD GPCRs achieves robust predictive performance for both ligand bioactivity and mutational effects across a broad range of class A GPCRs, underscoring its potential as a valuable tool for ligand discovery, especially for poorly characterized receptors.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

The model describes the effects of DNA linker length, histone tail acetylation, linker histone H1, and multi-bromodomain proteins such as BRD4. It is designed to be experimentally accurate but computationally efficient, allowing the study of 100kb genomic regions on a timescale of seconds with moderate resources. We apply this model to explore the structure and dynamics of two active loci of mouse embryonic stem cells, Pou5f1 and Sox2, as determined by solely their underlying epigenetic patterns. Our simulations reveal that chromatin folds into liquid-like domains characterized by similar histone modifications. These domains are highly dynamic, driving the formation of transient contacts between distant cis-regulatory regions. In silico mutation studies further clarify the distinct roles played by histone acetylation, linker histone, and BRD4.

Yet, the mechanisms by which glycans modulate the physicochemical properties of protein surfaces remain incompletely understood. Erythropoietin (EPO), a therapeutic glycoprotein with three N-glycosylation sites, provides a tractable model for dissecting site-specific glycan effects on protein functions. Here, we employ glycan-focused enhanced molecular dynamics simulations, specifically generalized replica exchange with solute tempering (gREST), to overcome the limited sampling of conventional MD and capture the extensive conformational heterogeneity of glycans. Our results demonstrate that glycan effects are highly non-additive: specific combinations of glycosylation sites yield emergent structural outcomes through spatial and dynamical cooperativity. Among them, the N83-linked glycan plays a dominant role in shielding a hydrophobic surface helix, thereby reducing local solvent-accessible hydropathy. Strikingly, the extent of this glycan-mediated surface masking quantitatively correlates with experimentally measured retention times in hydrophobic interaction chromatography, establishing a functional link between molecular-scale shielding and macroscopic behavior. These findings reveal that N-glycans modulate protein surfaces not only through local steric occlusion but also via long-range allosteric effects, providing a new framework for understanding and engineering glycoprotein properties.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

To keep pace, characterization must evolve toward greater automation and scalability. Here, we present an integrated and automatable workflow for multicolor DNA point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) super-resolution microscopy tailored for nanoparticles. Our approach combines kinetic simulations, automated multiplexed imaging, and streamlined image analysis to enable end-to-end automation, from experimental design to quantitative data output. Simulations predict optimal experimental conditions, thus reducing the need for manual optimization. A fluidics system paired with a TIRF microscope is used to automate multiplexed imaging by rounds of imaging and probe exchange (exchange-PAINT) on multiple memorized positions without human oversight during the acquisition process. Finally, an image analysis pipeline tailored for NPs allows for the quantification of nanoparticle size and multiplexed ligand functionalization. This methodology improves the throughput and reproducibility of single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) using DNA-PAINT and lowers the entry barrier for non-expert users, thus paving the way for broader adoption in nanomedicine and materials discovery workflows.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

These suckers attach to substrates ranging from the stiff, rough exoskeletons of crustaceans to the soft, smooth mucosal tissues of other cephalopods. Despite generating higher suction pressures than octopuses, less attention has been given to the biomechanics of cuttlefish suckers. Cuttlefish suckers exhibit a stiff, rough papillated rim that acts as a seal when in contact with a substrate. We hypothesise that these rim papillae have evolved to attach to rough substrates that match their own rugosity and to prevent the trapping of water at the contact interface, which occurs for soft interfaces underwater. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the passive attachment performance of common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) suckers ex vivo on a variety of artificial substrates that differed in both stiffness and roughness. We found that suckers generated larger attachment forces on stiffer substrates. Furthermore, sucker attachment forces varied significantly with substrate roughness, where highest attachment forces occurred on substrate roughnesses that coincided with the average sucker papillae size (~6.33 m RMS). These findings indicate that the papillae morphology may be associated with attachment performance, and could inform the design and development of versatile, bioinspired suction cups.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

In its inactive state, RAF is held in an autoinhibited conformation in the cytosol through a combination of intramolecular interactions and binding to a regulatory 14-3-3 protein dimer. Activation of RAF is initiated by its interaction with membrane-localized, GTP-bound RAS, which induces conformational changes that release RAF from its autoinhibited state. However, the molecular mechanisms governing RAF activation remain incomplete, largely due to the challenges in experimentally capturing intermediate conformational states in this process. To address this gap, we developed a comprehensive all-atom model of BRAF based on existing cryo-EM structures. Using this model, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the stability and free energy landscape of autoinhibited BRAF in solution. Our analysis reveals conformational flexibility within the autoinhibited complex, suggesting that this dynamic behavior may play a role in facilitating BRAF activation upon engagement with membrane-bound RAS.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Weak alleles of fea3 can increase yield-related traits in maize, so understanding how FEA3 controls inflorescence development can maximize its potential as a crop improvement target. To identify FEA3's interaction network, we used TurboID-based proximity labeling in maize meristems, and identified a putative co-receptor, BARELY ANY MERISTEM 1D (BAM1D). BAM1D and FEA3 proximity labeling proteomes shared over 100 proteins, including many signaling proteins, suggesting they feed into a common signaling pathway. fea3 was epistatic to bam1d in the control of IM size, supporting the idea that FEA3 and BAM1D interact physically. However, fea3 and bam1d act antagonistically, because fea3 mutants had larger inflorescence meristems (IMs), whereas bam1d mutants produced smaller IMs. Together, this study demonstrates how in vivo TurboID-based proximity labeling clarifies complex genetic interactions between CLV receptors and expands our knowledge of downstream signaling components of CLV signaling pathways, which are largely uncharacterized.

Antibiotic-resistant infections often lead to antibiotic treatment failure, underscoring the need of developing alternative treatments. The highly selective antimicrobial potential of CRISPR-Cas9 has been demonstrated in a range of model organisms. However, the effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas9 in combating ST131-associated infections and the consequences of CRISPR-Cas9 treatment, such as the emergence of escapers, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of CRISPR-Cas9 against ST131 and assessed the frequency and genetic basis of escape. We conjugatively delivered CRISPR-Cas9 to ST131 isolates which carried cefotaxime-resistance-encoding target gene blaCTX-M-15 in the chromosome and characterized escape subpopulations. Two main types of escapers emerged: blaCTX-M-15-positive escapers carried dysfunctional CRISPR-Cas9 systems and arose at a ~10-5 frequency. Instead, blaCTX-M-15-negative escapers presented chromosomal deletions involving blaCTX-M-15 loss. The frequency of blaCTX-M-15 loss depended on the blaCTX-M-15 genetic context. Specifically, blaCTX-M-15-negative escapers emerged at low frequency (~10-5) in isolates where blaCTX-M-15 was located downstream of insertion sequence (IS) ISEcp1, while escapers emerged with high frequency (~10-3) in isolates where blaCTX-M-15 was flanked by IS26.

Viral mRNAs are resistant to the translation shutoff and cleavage induced by Nsp1, and the 5' leader sequence present in all viral mRNAs has been shown to confer resistance. However, the exact molecular mechanism for escape from Nsp1 host shutoff has not been demonstrated. In our previous work, we analyzed the effects of Nsp1 on the expression and function of cellular proteins important for stress granule formation. We discovered that the host transcript for the TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein like 1 (TIAL1, commonly referred to as TIAR) is resistant to SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 host shutoff. In this work, using reporter shutoff assays, we examined sequence and structural features of the TIAR 5' untranslated region (UTR) and discovered that the first 23 nucleotides of the TIAR transcript are both necessary and sufficient to confer resistance to the Nsp1. Furthermore, our work revealed that the lack of guanosines within a window of 10 to 18 nucleotides downstream from the 5' end is a defining feature of Nsp1-resistant transcripts shared between the SARS-CoV-2 leader sequence and the TIAR 5' UTR.

Systematically interrogating all pairwise combinations provides insights into how genes are organized into pathways and complexes to sustain cellular homeostasis and how interacting genes respond to stressors and external signals. Genetic interactions have been studied extensively in yeast, due, in part, to the availability of a systematic collection of gene knockouts, and the development of Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) technology. In contrast, such approaches are more challenging in human cells and therefore comparable data for human cells is scarce. This study introduces an innovative approach to functionally characterize genetic interactions in human cells through CRISPR/Cas9 screens using a pooled genome-wide knockout library in NALM6 cells. By combining a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the gene of interest (aka the query) in cells already infected with an inducible genome-wide sgRNA pool, it is possible to achieve near saturation of genome-wide double knockouts. We conducted 26 of these screens, which we term \"gene by genome-wide\" knockout screens. This approach can be rapidly performed, in part, because it bypasses the need to generate genotyped isogenic knockout clones. Data from these screens identified both expected and novel synthetic lethal and synthetic rescue interactions, demonstrating that this strategy is effective for large-scale genetic research in human cells. Additionally, we show that these GBGW screens can be combined with chemical perturbation to reveal new synthetic interactions that are not apparent without drug treatment.

The high diversity of the grain and bioenergy crop sorghum, and many other crops that were not homogenized during the green revolution, not only provides the raw materials for breeders to make substantial gains in cultivar improvement, but also constrains breeding efforts due to highly specialized locally adapted plant phenotypes. Here, we construct a 33-member pangenome and identify trait-associated variants in 1,988 cultivars and landraces. We then apply these resources to explore the complex interplay between historical contingency, ongoing adaptation, and the potential for future gains through climate-aware genome-enabled breeding. Specifically, our analyses conclusively demonstrate that multiple nested, deeply diverged, and previously uncharacterized structural variants in the domestication gene SHATTERING1 distinguish the previously established multicentric origin of sorghum. We then apply landscape genomics tests to reveal how gene flow, adaptation, and secondary contact created the complex genetic mosaic in current global breeding networks. Further analysis of climate-gene associations highlights candidate loci underlying adaptation, including the biosynthetic gene cluster for the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin. Combined, the pangenome-informed variants developed here will enable both trait discovery and subsequent marker assays to accelerate breeding and provide a framework for similar applications in other diverse and non-model crops.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

S.; Oliveira, M.", "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a central role in thermogenesis by coupling fatty acid oxidation to heat production. Efficient BAT thermogenic activity requires enhanced glycolytic flux, which in turn depends on continuous regeneration of cytosolic NAD+ to sustain glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase activity. This regeneration is mediated by three main pathways: lactate dehydrogenase, the glycerol 3 phosphate shuttle, and the malate aspartate shuttle (MASh). We previously showed that inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier increases energy expenditure in brown adipocytes via MASh activation. However, the specific contribution of MASh to BAT energy metabolism remains poorly defined. Here, we show that MASh is functional and directly regulates lipid metabolism in BAT. Enzymatic activities of cytosolic and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenases and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminases in BAT were comparable to those in the liver. Using a reconstituted system of isolated BAT mitochondria and cytosolic MASh enzymes, we demonstrated that extra-mitochondrial NADH is efficiently reoxidized in a glutamate-dependent manner via MASh. Genetic silencing of the mitochondrial carriers critical to MASh, namely the oxoglutarate carrier (OGC1) and aspartate glutamate carrier (Aralar1), had no apparent effects on respiratory rates. However, silencing either OGC1 or Aralar1 led to the accumulation of small lipid droplets and impaired norepinephrine induced lipolysis. Taken together, our data indicate a novel role of MASh in regulating BAT lipid homeostasis with potential implications to body energy expenditure and thermogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Herein, we characterized molecular drivers of baseline ctDNA variability in a real-world cohort of 118 patients with ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed a strong positive correlation between ctDNA levels and cellular proliferation, and an inverse relationship with immune activity. Particularly, low ctDNA tumors exhibited higher bulk expression of mucins and CIITA, suggesting that intrinsic immune responses and immune landscape are linked to ctDNA release. The low and high ctDNA levels were significantly associated with poor prognosis compared to medium level in unresectable HGSC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Connected to this, there is an increasing research interest in improving childhood nature experiences and environmental awareness through direct outdoor educational activities. While this research largely remains geographically biassed to the nature of temperate regions, global and national policies are pushing towards place-based outdoor environmental education in other geographies where research and theory-practice gap persists. The existing environmental outdoor education literature identifies the on-ground challenges, mostly from educators' perspectives and focusing on academic achievements of participants. A better understanding of culturally specific, locally appropriate, and diverse pedagogies, drawing on both children's and educators' voices and relational values is required to fill this gap. We studied ~20 years old, unique place-based conservation education sessions on the rock outcrops in Kannur (Kerala, India), facilitated by schools and non-governmental organizations. These sessions introduce children to the experience, ecology and conservation issues of rocky outcrops, an easily accessible local socio-ecological system. Considering this as a case-study, using mixed-methods, we aimed to assess (i) if and how these outdoor sessions improve socio-scientific understanding, and positive attitudes towards these habitats and their conservation in children, and to (ii) identify the sessions' strengths, challenges, and relational values reflected in them through long-term experiences of its participants and educators. Our within-participant pre- and post- outdoor session surveys showed quantitative evidence for short-term increase in overall knowledge, but not any notable changes in measured attitudes or interests. But, the qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with children and educators revealed major strengths of the sessions around the Natureculture elements, and relational values; while the challenges were mostly around educators' understanding of children, pedagogical design, and logistics. Drawing on the long-term experiences of educators and children in the backdrop of existing global literature on outdoor education, we provide new insights on how using the power of emotions and experiences, positive and solution-oriented outlooks, unique socio-ecological elements, and relational values can be beneficial in designing conservation education sessions in often overlooked geographic and cultural contexts.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated how natural walking modulates auditory change detection by recording EEG while participants performed a transitional click train task during sitting and walking. Behaviorally, walking significantly elevated auditory change detection thresholds, reflecting reduced perceptual sensitivity. Electrophysiologically, three distinct auditory responses onset, change, and offset were evoked; both the onset and change responses were attenuated during walking, with the most pronounced effect observed for the cognitively demanding change response. Notably, this modulation was further amplified for the change response during active engagement compared to passive listening, implicating attentional resource allocation. Strikingly, both behavioral performance and change-related neural responses fluctuated rhythmically with the gait cycle, while onset and offset responses remained comparatively stable. Together, these findings reveal a stride-phase-dependent gating mechanism that selectively modulates perceptually relevant auditory signals, illustrating how the brain rhythmically reallocates sensory resources to optimize perception during locomotion.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

While chronic inflammatory signaling likely plays an important role in alcohol-associated neurological sequalae, the precise mechanisms underlying alcohol-associated neuropathology remain enigmatic. We hypothesize that alcohol leads to neuroimmune dysregulation among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia; and is perpetuated by innate immune signaling pathways involving cell-cell signaling. To investigate how alcohol dysregulates neuroimmune interactions in a human context, we constructed a triculture model comprising neurons, astrocytes, and microglia derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. After exposure to ethanol, we observed significant differential gene expression relating to innate immune pathways, inflammation, and microglial activation. Microglial activation was confirmed with morphological analysis and expression of CD68, a lysosomal-associated membrane protein and marker for phagocytic microglial activation. A striking finding in our study was the elevation of TREM2 expression and, specifically, TREM2 alternative splice variants that are predicted to give rise to soluble TREM2 . These results suggest that ethanol exposure in the brain may lead to increased microglial activation and production of soluble isoform named TREM2219 through alternate splicing. Deciphering the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning ethanol-related neuroimmune dysregulation within a human context promises to shed light on the etiology of AUD-related disorders, potentially contributing to the development of effective therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

L.; Laborde, A.; Orger, M.", "abstract": "We present Sardine, a software framework built with .NET to control experimental setups through the reliable execution of dynamic networks of independent modules, where each module can interface with a hardware device (e.g., camera, motor) or represent an operation over data (e.g., image filter, data stream). The Sardine framework delivers robust fault-tolerant hardware control and eliminates downstream delays by implementing dedicated data processing queues for each module. Any .NET class can be seamlessly adapted into a Sardine module, enabling effortless integration with existing codebases. Sardines modular architecture ensures flexibility to accommodate changes in experimental paradigms, simplifying the adaptation of essential features, such as swapping hardware components or redefining the logic of their interactions. The core of Sardine is a novel aggregation system that connects modules in two layers, designed to streamline complex workflows such as those in microscopy applications. The first layer (link layer) enables concurrent operations between modules, such as synchronizing a camera module with a stage controller or a laser module, while maintaining a dependency tree to ensure devices operate as intended. For example, in an imaging experiment, Sardine oversees individual module malfunctions, such as a camera failure or stage misalignment, gracefully handling errors and dynamically restoring functionality to impacted network segments to minimize disruption. The second layer (data layer) facilitates the transmission of information across modules by associating them with operations that produce, consume, or transform data. In an imaging context, this could involve processing raw image data from a camera module, passing it through a real-time analysis module for feature detection, and forwarding the results to a visualization module for immediate feedback. This two-layer architecture ensures seamless data flow and robust error handling, making Sardine ideal for dynamic and complex experimental setups. Sardine also integrates logging, a metadata collection system, and tools to create graphical applications.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Innovative immunomodulatory therapies, including fibroblast-based cell therapies, offer promising alternatives. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) organized into three-dimensional (3D) spheroids in a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis. Methods HDF spheroids were cultured using Elplasia microcavity plates, and their size, viability, and phenotype were compared with single cells in 2D monolayer cultures. Cellular responses in whole blood and acute inflammatory responses were evaluated at various time points following intravenous injection of HDFs. The therapeutic efficacy of HDF spheroids was assessed using an IMQ-induced psoriasis mouse model, with disease severity scored using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Optimized HDF spheroids (~150 um, 1x106 cells/mouse) were administered intravenously in a single dose for mild psoriasis or multiple doses for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The efficacy of HDF spheroids was compared to a pre-clinical monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin 23 (anti-IL-23). Results Spheroid cultures of HDFs showed reduced cell size, enhanced viability, and distinct phenotypic changes compared to monolayer cultures. Intravenous injection of HDF spheroids resulted in less thrombocytopenia and reduced acute inflammatory responses compared to single-cell injection. A single dose of HDF spheroids reduced the severity of mild psoriasis by 35%, while repeated doses resulted in a 36% reduction in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Single-dose administration normalized blood cell counts, alleviated spleen enlargement, and improved cytokine dysregulation. Although HDF spheroids and anti-IL-23 reduced epidermal thickening and immune cell infiltration, HDF spheroids uniquely inhibited monocyte production and infiltration, a benefit not observed with anti-IL-23. No acute or chronic toxicity was observed. Conclusions HDF spheroids offer comparable therapeutic efficacy to anti-IL-23 in treating psoriasis, with a distinct mechanism involving inhibiting monocyte production and infiltration. Their safety profile and broader immunomodulatory potential support their development as a novel therapeutic strategy for psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Facultative diapause, a programmed developmental arrest, enables organisms to survive adverse environmental conditions, representing environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity. The band-legged ground cricket Dianemobius nigrofasciatus provides a unique model for studying diapause mechanisms, exhibiting maternal diapause induction where short-day exposure of mothers triggers embryonic diapause in offspring at the cellular blastoderm stage, the earliest diapause entry point among insects. Here, we investigated how maternally transmitted environmental signals regulate embryonic development at the molecular level. We assembled a high-quality genome (1.45 Gbp) and performed time-series transcriptomic analyses of diapause and non-diapause eggs from 12 to 72 hours post-oviposition (hpo). Despite morphological similarity at 12-24 hpo, diapause-destined eggs showed specific upregulation of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling genes, particularly Brahma complex core subunits, at 24 hpo. ATAC-seq analysis at 24 hpo revealed reduced chromatin accessibility near neural and cell cycle-related genes in these eggs. Time-series clustering identified a temporal shift, where RNA processing genes peaked at 24 hpo in diapause-destined eggs versus 40 hpo in non-diapause eggs that undergo direct development, suggesting temporal reorganization allows completion of transcriptional processing before developmental arrest. After diapause initiation (56-72 hpo), while non-diapause eggs upregulated neural differentiation and proliferation genes, diapause eggs showed enhanced expression of amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis genes, indicating metabolic regulation for long-term survival. Our findings reveal diapause as an actively regulated developmental state involving coordinated epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic remodeling. This cricket model provides insights into how maternal environmental signals guide offspring development through integrated molecular mechanisms, with implications for understanding phenotypic plasticity.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that the lmx1b paralogues have divergent developmental roles in zebrafish, with lmx1ba affecting skeletal and neuronal development, and lmx1bb affecting renal development. The double mutant, representing loss of both paralogues (lmx1b dKO) showed a stronger phenotype which included additional defects to trunk muscle patterning, and a failure to fully inflate the notochord leading to a dramatic reduction in body length.

Previous work has shown that negative density-dependence typically reduces the probability of evolutionary rescue. However, these models make several major simplifying assumptions, either that selection acts strictly on intrinsic growth rates, r, or carrying capacity, K. Here, we simulate evolutionary rescue in a consumer-resource model, making explicit several ecological traits that may differentially affect r and K, and considering a self-replenishing resource. We demonstrate that the effect of density-dependence on rescue is indeed negative but weak, and declines with an increasing degree of maladaptation. The effect of density-dependence is also shown to be trait-dependent, since an environmental perturbation that reduces fitness may also increase or decrease resource competition, intensifying or relaxing density-dependence. Furthermore, we show that the relationship between malthusian fitness immediately following an environmental change and rescue probabilities depends strongly on the affected ecological trait, such that measurements of the rate of decline alone immediately following an environmental change are likely insufficient to predict rescue outcomes. In particular, reductions in the conversion efficiency of resources into offspring are shown to be a greater hindrance to rescue than reductions in resource acquisition rates, whereas populations are able to tolerate substantial reductions in survivorship. Lastly, we show that an abrupt environmental change that also impacts an evolving resource always hinders the evolutionary rescue of consumers, with reductions in resource carrying capacity being more harmful than reductions in resource growth rates. Our work improves our theoretical understanding of how ecology and evolution interact to affect evolutionary rescue, providing greater mechanistic insight into the underlying processes.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

We recently identified the formation of cell-substrate adhesion populations in Dictyostelium discoideum with differing molecular compositions, but it is unclear how these distinct compositions influence Dictyostelium adhesion dynamics and cell migration. Here, we further investigate the role of molecular composition on Dictyostelium adhesion lifetime and protein turnover during cell migration. We show that co-localization of VinculinB to PaxillinB-positive cell-substrate adhesions increases adhesion lifetime without changing PaxillinB turnover. We further show that perturbing cell-substrate adhesion composition with a PaxillinB N-terminal truncation increases adhesion lifetime and decreases PaxillinB turnover at adhesions.

Genetic parameters were estimated using the AIREML option in the BLUPF90+ software, and GEBVs were generated by ssGBLUP with the algorithm for proven and young (APY). Heritability for the service sire effect ranged from 0.01 to 0.03, and the heritability for the dam effect ranged from 0.09 to 0.15, with genetic correlations ranging from -0.20 to 0.37.

Through these approaches, we reveal that fibroblasts and its subpopulation-late myofibroblasts (MF)-constitute a major proportion of senescent cells, which functionally reduce ECM production. Importantly, ischemia-induced senescent MF show less soluble collagen production compared to TGF-{beta}1- induced non-senescent MF in vitro. At the functional level, depletion of senescent cells in vivo augments fibrosis and worsens cardiac myopathy post-MI. Our findings highlight the transient nature of senescent cells in the heart and underscore the importance of dynamic regulation of senescent cells post-MI.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

M.; Choisy, M.", "abstract": "Compartmental models are widely used for dynamical systems where states are discrete such as in infectious diseases epidemiology with the so-called SIR or Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered framework. For mathematical simplicity, rates of transition between compartments are generally assumed to be independent of the dwell time (a.k.a. secondary time scale in survival analysis): they are either constant or dependent on the epidemiological time (a.k.a. primary time scale in survival analysis) only, either directly (e.g. environmental or behavioral forcings in epidemiological models) or indirectly through dependence on other variables of the system (e.g. the force of infection in epidemiological models). In some domains of application, this memoryless assumption leads to distributions of dwelling times that are incompatible with those observed on data is this can lead to serious problems since the model prediction are highly sensitive on the exact shape of these distributions. Here we propose a deterministic, continuous-variable, discrete-time compartmental modelling approach that allows full flexibility on the dwell time distributions. The accompanying denim package provides a user-friendly interface to implement our proposed method through a dedicated language for model definition. The package is open-source and available on CRAN. With more detailed data on the clinical process of infections becoming available, the denim package will be extremely useful for building more realistic epidemiological models providing more accurate projections.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine how metabolic factors (particularly glucose) and sex hormone levels (progesterone and estradiol) influence cortisol reactivity to acute stress. We identified 21 studies (N = 1216 participants) and conducted random-effects meta-analyses for metabolic and hormonal states. Across studies, glucose administration was associated with a significant increase in cortisol responses to acute stress compared to fasting or non-glucose control conditions (d = 0.30, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.60], BF10 = 2.42, NNT = 10.63). In contrast, the effects of sex hormones on cortisol responses were smaller and more variable, with both progesterone and estradiol showing weak and inconsistent associations. Our results highlight a robust modulatory role of metabolic state, specifically glucose availability, on HPA axis reactivity, while evidence for sex hormone effects remains inconclusive. Future research should focus on better harmonization of designs concerning sex hormones and systematically examine interactions between metabolic and hormonal states to better explain sex differences in the prevalences of metabolic and stress-related disorders.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of GPR89 in Eukarya by integrating phylogenetic reconstruction, genomic synteny, sequence conservation, and structural modeling. While GPR89 is typically encoded as a single-copy gene, we identified lineage-specific duplications in both vascular plants and vertebrates. In contrast to the large sequence conservation, large differences can be observed in whether plants and animals preserve the gene structure flanking GPR89. Structural phylogenetic clustering places GPR89 within the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily, supporting previous reports claiming transporter-like activity rather than GPCR signaling. Predicted structures reveal a unique intracellular hairpin loop and a conserved transmembrane core compatible with transport activity.

Studies have attributed this ecological success to buoyancy regulation, low-light adaptations, and the uptake of nitrogen-rich amino acids. Yet, it remains to be mechanistically determined how this cHAB maintains physiological nutrient quotas in the metalimnion due to limited in situ molecular studies. We employed metagenomics and metabolomics to investigate a toxigenic P. rubescens bloom in Meads Quarry (Knoxville, TN, USA) observed in two separate years. Our results suggest a perennial, metalimnic P. rubescens population may exist, with spring turnover facilitating seasonal migration to the epilimnion. Although P. rubescens dominated the epilimnion and metalimnion, intracellular metabolite pools grouped by depth and suggested depth-discrete partitioning of the arginine deiminase-mediated ornithine-arginine cycle (OAC, i.e., urea cycle). While the arginine influx driving the OAC is unclear, we hypothesize this input is provided via the uptake of urea or nitrogen-rich amino acids. Further, we demonstrate arginine deiminase (argE) is broadly distributed in Planktothrix genera and known microcystin producers, suggesting argE-mediated arginine recycling via the OAC may influence the fitness of toxigenic cHAB genera which require ample nitrogen to synthesize microcystins. Cumulatively, our results serve as a case study to provide insight on the metabolic pathways driving the ecological success of metalimnic P. rubescens blooms. On a broader scale, this work strengthens the case that alternative nitrogen metabolism (including urea utilization, amino acid uptake, and the OAC) is a driver of toxigenic cyanobacterial blooms in fresh waters.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Privacy regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR make centralized data aggregation across hospitals challenging, posing a barrier to collaborative healthcare research. In this study, we explore a privacy-preserving approach for ICU mortality prediction using Federated Learning (FL), which enables distributed model training without sharing sensitive patient data. Leveraging a curated subset of the eICU Collaborative Research Database---a multi-center dataset of over 200,000 ICU admissions---we simulate a real-world federated learning scenario using data from three distinct hospitals comprising 5,000 ICU stays. We design a federated logistic regression framework and evaluate its performance against independently trained local models. Our findings indicate that the federated model consistently outperforms local baselines, achieving improved accuracy and AUC while maintaining strict data privacy.

Here, we identify COPS5 as a therapeutic target and use an available small molecule inhibitor to overcome platinum resistance. A genetic screen for platinum-induced DNA damage in a platinum resistant ovarian cancer model identified COPS5 and COPS6, two components of the COP9 signalosome. Consistently, high COPS5 expression correlated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with HGSC. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, COPS5 depletion sensitized ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin. A small molecule COPS5 inhibitor, CSN5i-3, synergized with carboplatin in homologous recombination-deficient and -proficient cells. This combination was also effective in xenografts and in a syngeneic mouse model of carboplatin-resistant HGSC. Importantly, we demonstrate that CSN5i-3 is selective for cancer cells, with patient-derived HGSC cells exhibiting up to 50-fold greater sensitivity to CSN5i-3 than benign cells. Finally, we show that genetic or small molecule inhibition of COPS5 impaired both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair, leading to increased DNA platinum adducts. Mechanistically, this was due to increased ubiquitination and degradation of DNA-specific DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) and other key NER and ICL repair proteins, consistent with the role of COPS5 in the regulation of these factors.

Using longitudinal plasma proteomics analyses in humans achieving 14% CR for 2 years, we identified that inhibition of the complement pathway is linked to lower inflammaging. The protein C3a (and its cleaved form) was significantly lowered by CR, thus reducing inflammation emanating from three canonical complement pathways. Interestingly, circulating C3a levels are increased during aging in mice, with visceral adipose tissue macrophages as the predominant source. In macrophages, C3a signaling via ERK elevated inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting the existence of an autocrine loop that promotes inflammaging. Notably, long-lived FGF21-overexpressing mice and PLA2G7-deficient mice exhibited lower C3a in aging. Specific small molecule-mediated systemic C3 inhibition reduced inflammaging, improved metabolic homeostasis, and enhanced healthspan of aged mice.

We quantified the synaptic density in each layer, classified synaptic boutons according to their number of synapses and mitochondrial content, and quantified key morphometric parameters, including bouton volume, postsynaptic density (PSD) area and morphology, volume occupied by mitochondria, and postsynaptic targets. Our results revealed that for all the layers there is a higher proportion of single-synapse boutons without mitochondria. Multisynaptic boutons containing mitochondria (MSBm+) -which likely correspond to TC terminals -were significantly more abundant in the thalamocortical recipient layers 4C and 4C{beta}. These MSBm+ boutons were also larger, more likely to contact dendritic spines, and contained more mitochondria than other bouton categories. In contrast, layer 3B, displayed a lower prevalence of MSBm+ boutons, these boutons were smaller than those in layer 4C and made fewer synapses. These findings highlight laminar differences in bouton architecture and support the idea that TC synapses are structurally adapted to support high synaptic efficacy.

A growing body of evidence links depression in HDGECs to striatal and default mode network (DMN) regions, however, the longitudinal evolution of network dysfunction and its relationship to depressive symptoms has not been characterized. The study included 105 HDGECs (53 Females, Mage = 43, Mean CAG repeat length = 43) from the largest longitudinal study of premanifest HD, TrackOn-HD. Here, we applied spectral dynamic causal modelling to examine effective connectivity changes over 24 months, alongside voxel-based morphometry of grey matter atrophy and linear mixed models of depressive symptoms, including volumetry. We show that depression-related network dysconnection operates independently of regional grey matter atrophy, with HDGECs exhibiting widespread striatal volume loss but no differential atrophy patterns between depression groups. Critically, we demonstrate that larger posterior cingulate cortex volumes predicted increased depression severity specifically in HDGECs with depression history, across both Beck Depression Inventory-II (p = .041) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression Subscale (p = .002). Spectral dynamic causal models explained 88.6% of variance in depression groups and 90.4% in non-depression groups, demonstrating robust model performance. Longitudinal effective connectivity analyses revealed distinct dysconnection profiles: HDGECs with depression history showed widespread interhemispheric alterations including progressive inhibitory changes of striatal-DMN circuits and aberrant hippocampal regulatory control, while those without depression exhibited more focal dysconnection. These patterns occurred despite no group differences in grey matter atrophy trajectories across striatal or cortical regions over the 24-month period. Furthermore, we identify that clinically elevated depressive symptoms associate with differential connectivity patterns of the PCC and hippocampus depending on depression history, suggesting pathological mechanisms become progressively maladaptive. Our findings challenge that structural preservation confers functional resilience in neurodegeneration, instead suggesting pathological mechanisms and revealing that functional network reorganization in relatively preserved regions drives depression vulnerability in premanifest HD.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

However, findings across studies are inconsistent and sometimes contradictory, likely due to a low reliability of the measures employed. These inconsistencies limit the interpretability and generalizability of results, emphasizing the need for a systematic evaluation of measure reliability. In this study, we addressed this gap by identifying the most reliable EEG resting-state measures and evaluating their predictive value for LTM performance in a second-language (L2) vocabulary learning paradigm. A group of children (N = 36) and adults (N = 90) participated in 2 studies on app-assisted learning of second language vocabulary. Participants completed a test on L2 vocabulary and a resting-state EEG recording (180 s eyes open) before and after learning a second language using a smartphone app. We used Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) to identify resting state EEG measures with satisfying test-retest reliability (ICC >= 0.75) and then assessed how these reliable measures are associated with L2 vocabulary learning representing LTM performance. Highest ICC values were found for oscillatory power in the alpha range and in the frequency of occurrences, duration and coverages of microstates. Calculations yielded ICC values of 0.84/0.86 (children/adults) for alpha power and 0.88/0.80 for microstate measures. Of these measures, only alpha power showed a positive correlation with LTM performance, but only in the adult population (r = 0.38, p < .01). No other measures were associated with LTM (all p > 0.05). Alpha power could thus serve as a stable and reliable marker of the neural mechanisms accounting for high LTM performance in the fully developed adult brain.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

This study investigated whether activation of the liver-brain axis can modulate anxiety-like behavior in mice. Advillin (Avil)CreERT2; channelrhodopsin-tdTomato mice and wireless optogenetics were used to selectively stimulate Avil-positive vagal sensory neurons that innervate the liver in freely moving mice. Acute optogenetic stimulation of their nerves in the liver activated neurons in the nodose ganglia and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and to a lesser extent, those in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Behavioral assessments revealed that acute optogenetic stimulation of these liver-innervating vagal sensory nerves increased anxiety-like behavior in male and female mice during open field, elevated plus maze, and light/dark box tests. Retrograde viral tracing revealed that neurons in the NTS sent projections to the locus coeruleus (LC), and optogenetic stimulation of liver-innervating vagal sensory nerves resulted in significant activation of norepinephrine-expressing neurons in the LC. Therefore, these findings reveal a novel liver-NTS-LC circuit that plays a role in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior through vagal sensory neurons.

Despite the crucial importance of RF coils, the practical coil design process has remained a largely empirical one. This work introduces a novel optimization framework for rational coil design, which relies on a fully automated pipeline that combines rapid electromagnetic simulations, shape optimization and coil meshing. The objective function iteratively maximizes SNR performance in a target region of interest with respect to the ultimate intrinsic SNR, which is the theoretically highest SNR independent from any particular coil design. The forward simulation employs a fast electromagnetic solver based on coupled surface and volume integral equations. The coils are represented as B-spline curves with an associated width, and automatically meshed for EM simulation. We implemented a new method to tune and decouple coils at each iteration without manual user intervention. The algorithm optimizes the size and position of a given number of coils with a combination of grid search and a line search. We demonstrated the framework by designing receive arrays of increasing complexity that yield optimal SNR for different target regions inside a numerical head model. SNR simulation time ranged from 15s for a 3-coil configuration to 32s for a 12-coil array, constrained to a helmet-like surface, including tuning and decoupling. The optimized 12-coil geometry yielded 9% higher average SNR performance in the brain at 3T.

Although there has been progress in integrating multi-omics data for clustering, combining more than two types of omics data remains challenging due to the diversity and heterogeneity of these datasets. Traditional approaches typically use heterogeneous graphs that integrate only two types of omics data, constructing graphs with genes and cells as nodes and a single type of edge representing their relationships. However, this method has limitations as it overlooks cell-cell interactions and struggles to capture complex cellular dynamics. Additionally, the graph structure must be redesigned whenever new omics data are introduced, limiting the scalability of these models. To address these issues, we introduce MOH, a novel single-cell clustering algorithm based on a multilayer multi-omics heterogeneous graph. MOH integrates three key single-cell omics types: scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics. It constructs a multilayer heterogeneous graph to simultaneously extract and enhance representations from all three omics layers, incorporating both intra-layer and inter-layer edges to capture association and similarity relationships. This enriched representation leads to an accurate clustering results.

G.; Cai, L.", "abstract": "Genetic and epigenetic aberrations often act in concert to establish oncogenic transcriptomic programs in aggressive cancers. For example, the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an advanced prostate cancer form, is closely associated with over-expression and/or hyper-activation of transcription factors (TFs) such as Androgen Receptor (AR) and Yin Yang 1 (YY1), as well as p300, a prominent histone acetyltransferase. How exactly these cancer-related lesions are coordinated to generate a malignant cell state remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that YY1, which is frequently over-expressed in advanced prostate cancers, allosterically stimulates the acetyltransferase activity of p300 in cis, leading to the globally elevated acetylation of histone H3 lysine 18 and 27 (H3K18ac and H3K27ac). Mechanistically, YY1's N-terminal activation domain (AD) directly interacts with p300's TAZ2 domain, relieving the autoinhibition of p300 to facilitate substrate acetylation. Our integrated genome-wide mapping and transcriptomic studies reveal significant co-localization of genomic binding sites of YY1, androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7, a constitutively active form of AR) and p300 in CRPC cells, where the YY1-mediated p300 activation and resultant histone acetylation increases promote the oncogenic gene-expression programs downstream of YY1 and AR/AR-V7. Both in vitro and in vivo functional assays demonstrate a critical requirement of the above signaling for the advanced disease progression and drug resistance seen in CRPC. Altogether, this study uncovers that YY1 acts to alleviate p300's autoinhibition at target genes co-bound by oncogenic TFs (YY1 and/or AR/AR-V7) in CRPC, thereby sustaining tumorigenicity. Additionally, the blockade of YY1-mediated gene activation resensitizes CRPC to treatment to the clinic anti-AR agent (enzalutamide), which provides a rationale for overcoming the therapeutic resistance often seen in advanced prostate cancers.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Despite its efficacy, CHOP may cause deleterious off-target effects during critical pediatric development periods such as impairments of skeletal muscle. We evaluated the acute effects of a CHOP administered to C57Bl/6J mice from postnatal day28 to 48. CHOP slowed body-weight gain and has smaller gastrocnemius fiber cross-sectional area by approximately 25percent in both sexes. mRNAsequencing detected 214 differentially expressed genes in males and 217 in females relative to controls, yet only 29 transcripts overlapped. Males exhibited downregulation of myogenic regulators, indicating impaired progenitor maintenance, whereas females showed an upregulation of extracellular-matrix and translational machinery genes plus cell-cycle regulators. Using immunohistochemistry to assess satellite cell abundance, there were 60% fewer satellite cells in males and a 40% fewer in females, which supported our transcriptional findings. These results demonstrate that pediatric CHOP acutely disrupts muscle stem-cell dynamics via sex-specific molecular programs and identify satellite-cell depletion as a potential target for preserving muscle health in pediatric cancer survivors.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

This change freed plant reproduction from aquatic dependence, fostering terrestrial life's prosperity. Key to the shift from archegonial to embryo sac reproduction are pollen tube emergence and female gametophyte changes, though their evolutionary trajectories and mechanisms remain unclear. Ginkgo, a basal gymnosperm, occupies a pivotal position in this transition, retaining motile sperm, simplified archegonia, and primitive pollen tubes, making it an ideal model. To study how the transition between these two reproductive modes occurred, we collected transcriptome data from the reproductive organs of Ginkgo and evolutionarily representative species. Our findings reveal the MYB98-CRP-ECS module- critical for angiosperm pollen tube guidance- in Ginkgo's mature archegonia, with pollen tubes containing guidance components. While egg cells are transcriptionally and functionally conserved across land plants, changes in the cell fate of other female gametophyte component cells drove the shift from archegonia to embryo sacs. Pollen tubes may originate from fern male gametophyte internalization and modification.

While there is growing interest in the possibility that inflammatory responses are involved with HDP, work to date has largely been cross-sectional, and immune cell profiling has focused on cell phenotyping that may not capture relevant functional properties of the immune cells. Objective: To examine whether an inflammatory cellular response is found in the blood of pregnant women preceding the clinical onset of HDP. Study design: This nested case-control study included 27 pregnant women who later developed HDP and 73 who had a healthy pregnancy delivered at term, all of whom provided blood samples during the second trimester. Results: We observed a greater abundance of peripheral blood T cells in individuals who were later diagnosed with HDP. Among these were CD161+ CD4 T cells that showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including GM-CSF and TNF. Similarly, monocytes from these individuals exhibited increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Anti-inflammatory T cells and monocytes were not altered in those with versus without a future diagnosis of HDP. Conclusion: We identify a pro-inflammatory cellular immune signature in pregnant individuals destined to have HDP. Immune signatures may serve as a new biomarker to identify subsets of individuals at particular risk for HDP and/or may point to new therapeutic targets to prevent HDP.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

We predict and observe that the cooperative export of repressive miRNAs achieves synchronized upregulation of pro-inflammatory targets in activated macrophage cells. Exploring the molecular basis of this event, we have noted the co-entry of miRNAs into endosomes for their extracellular export, highlighting the selective and cooperative nature of endosome targeting of miRNAs. HuR, a miRNA-binding protein crucial for selectively exporting specific sets of miRNAs from various cell types, facilitates cooperative miRNA entry into endosomes both in the in vivo and in vitro assay conditions.

Methods: We measured anti-CBir1, ANCA, anti-OmpC, ASCA IgA, and ASCA IgG levels in the cord blood of babies born to 78 mothers with or without IBD. Their association with fecal calprotectin (FC), and microbiota composition, characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing, was assessed throughout pregnancy and during the first 3 years of life using linear mixed-effects models. Results: Antibodies were detected in cord blood, with significantly higher levels of anti-CBir1 and ASCA IgG in babies born to mothers with Crohn's disease (p = 0.002) and higher abundance of ANCA and anti-OmpC in babies of mothers with ulcerative colitis (p = 0.002), compared to controls.

Ticks were morphologically characterized, pooled by origin and life-stage, screened for Cytauxzoon spp. 18S rRNA by qPCR and conventional PCR and positive samples confirmed by sequencing. All ticks belonged to Ixodes ricinus (50 males, 83 females, 532 nymphs). Four tick pools from 2019 tested Cytauxzoon spp. positive: one pool of 4 non-engorged male ticks from cats and three pools of 5-6 nymphs each from vegetation. All ticks collected in 2022 and 2024 tested negative. Amplification of the almost full-length (1535 bp, 1 pool) or partial (219-140 bp, 3 pools) 18S rRNA gene revealed a sequence identify of 98.6-100% with Cytauxzoon spp. previously detected in cats from this area. The detection of Cytauxzoon spp. in questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs suggests a potential role of this tick species in the parasites transmission cycle in Central Europe and raises the possibility of transovarial transmission. Mitochondrial gene sequencing was unsuccessful, but the detected Cytauxzoon spp. likely represent Cytauxzoon europaeus. Discrepancies between qPCR and conventional PCR results point to possible amplification of tick endosymbionts, highlighting the importance of confirmatory sequencing particularly when testing tick-derived DNA.

This study used the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource to dissect the genetic architecture of both genotypic and genotype-by-diet interaction effects underlying trait variation. The study hypotheses were: 1) Loci responsible for metabolic phenotypic variation should be shared across traits. 2) Genetic loci responsible for plasticity and epistatic interactions for metabolic traits should also be the loci responsible for the main effects. 3) Genes responsible for variation in metabolic traits should share common functions. Using a round-robin crossing scheme and novel analyses, we mapped additive, dominance, and epistatic locisome diet-specific, others diet-independent. Main-effect and plastic loci were largely distinct, as were epistatic loci from main-effect loci, highlighting that main genetic effects alone will not explain how genetic variants interact with the environment or the genome to influence disease risk. gene-by-diet or gene-by-gene interactions influencing MetS risk. Further, tremendous cryptic genetic variation for metabolic traits is lurking in natural populations. We explored the function of candidate genes from our study empirically and with bioinformatics.

However, in biomedical imaging, images are typically acquired to facilitate an image-based inference, which we refer to as a downstream biological or clinical task. This study systematically investigates the utility of virtual staining for facilitating clinically relevant downstream tasks (like segmentation or classification) with consideration of the capacity of the deep neural networks employed to perform the tasks. Comprehensive empirical evaluations were conducted using biological datasets, assessing task performance by use of label-free, virtually stained, and ground truth fluorescence images. The results demonstrated that the utility of virtual staining is largely dependent on the ability of the segmentation or classification task network to extract meaningful task-relevant information, which is related to the concept of network capacity.

However, its direct target genes and the mechanisms by which it regulates their expression have remained elusive to date. In this study we identified the genome-wide DNA binding sites of AHL15, and show that AHL15 binds throughout the genome at AT-rich sequences near the transcription start- and end sites in regions depleted of epigenetic marks. We show that induction of AHL15 activity causes strong and rapid changes in transcription, with the majority of the differentially expressed genes being downregulated but without directly affecting chromatin accessibility, resulting in developmental defects. In addition, AHL15 binding to regions near the transcription start and end sites was enhanced at genes that were differentially expressed upon AHL15 induction, and was especially strong near the transcription start site of upregulated genes and near the transcription end site of downregulated genes. Finally, we show that AHL15 shares binding sites with the chromatin architectural protein GH1-HMGA2/HON5, which was previously shown to alter transcription by disrupting gene loop formation.

In this work, we demonstrate that this widely used approach has significant limitations that may have skewed our understanding of gene regulation in thermomorphogenesis.We found a surprisingly poor consensus among published whole seedling transcriptomic datasets. On average, nearly 60% of reported differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are unique to a single study. To investigate the source of this variability, we performed a controlled comparison of RNA sequencing data from whole seedlings versus dissected organs (root, hypocotyl, and cotyledon), which revealed strong organ-specific transcriptional responses to warmth. Critically, we found that ~70% of DEGs identified in whole seedlings were not differentially expressed in any of the individual organs, suggesting that whole seedling data is confounded by the pooling of distinct, and sometimes opposing, organ-level responses.

Although mutations in the N-alpha-acetyltransferase subunit gene NAA15 were recently associated with CHD in humans, a genetically engineered whole animal model of NAA15-related heart disease in a vertebrate species has yet to be described. We generated and characterized zebrafish carrying null mutations in paralogs naa15a and naa15b. Double homozygous naa15-deficient larvae suffered from diminutive, lowly contractile, and bradycardic ventricles composed of fewer and smaller cardiomyocytes incapable of proliferation. Myocardial re-expression of wild-type naa15a from a stable transgene partially rescued the contractile deficit. Moreover, transient, ubiquitous expression of WT human NAA15 achieved complete rescue, allowing for pathogenicity testing of human CHD variants of unknown significance. On a subcellular level, naa15-deficient CMs exhibited mild disruptions in sarcomere structure. Unlike double homozygous animals, animals carrying three mutant alleles and a reduced genetic dosage (RD) of naa15 grew to adulthood, sharing some phenotypes with double homozygous larvae, including reduced ventricular and cardiomyocyte size, as well as sarcomere disarray. Quantitative proteomics analysis of adult naa15RD hearts identified downregulation of proteins and acetylated N-terminal peptides from mitochondrial respiratory complex I. Abnormal mitochondrial density, size, and content were also documented in the myocardium of naa15-deficient larvae. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that a vertebrate animal model of naa15 disruption causes defects in cardiac development and function, with likely contributions from mitochondrial abnormalities, providing additional evidence that loss-of-function mutations in NAA15 are pathogenic for CHD.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

We developed a powerful model to evaluate antibody affinity maturation in vivo using immunoglobulin (Ig)-humanized mice that express the predicted germline heavy chain of antibody CR3022. SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 sequential immunization led to the convergent evolution of the germline CR3022 through somatic hypermutation (SHM) that resembled the affinity-matured CR3022 from a human, but now also adapted to key variants and divergent sarbecoviruses. While simple prime-boost strategies drove CR3022-epitope targeting, an intensive vaccination protocol elicited dominant responses to other epitopes. X-ray crystal structures revealed that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing CR3022-like antibodies exhibit enhanced affinity by increasing polar and electrostatic interactions.

Here, we uncover an equally potent post-entry mechanism of efflux pumps, revealing that their function extends deep into intracellular drug-target interactions. Using quantitative live-cell fluorescence imaging, we monitored the activity of major efflux systems in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Hoechst (HCT), a DNA-binding inhibitor. As expected, more HCT entered efflux-deficient cells than efflux-active cells. Unexpectedly, the intracellular HCT in efflux-deficient cells also bound DNA more stably, resulting in higher binding affinity. Statistical-physics-based modeling and experimental testing show that that unlike in dilute in vitro conditions, drug molecules that unbind from their targets in intracellular environments rapidly undergo successive rebinding, prolonging the lifetime of the drug-target complex. However, efflux pumps counteract this effect by suppressing rebinding, thereby kinetically destabilizing drug-target interactions and lowering the binding affinity. This kinetic destabilization acts synergistically with canonical gatekeeping to broaden and amplify drug resistance. Our findings reveal an underappreciated biophysical mechanism of efflux pumps, expanding the classical biochemical view of how efflux pumps confer multidrug resistance.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

The shock-and-kill cure concept shows promise in its ability to reactivate HIV-1 transcription in latently infected cells in vivo in people living with HIV-1 but has failed to result in a meaningful reduction of the size of the reactivatable viral reservoir. We therefore hypothesised that the efficiency of reversal of transcriptional quiescence, and the resulting HIV-1 antigen expression and presentation, may be insufficient to achieve full immunological visibility of HIV-1-infected cells. To gain a deeper understanding of potential LRA-specific shortcomings, we developed a novel model of HIV-1 latency - Jurkat E6.1 subclonal cell lines, each harbouring a single, full-length, NL4.3-based provirus with a GFPOPT reporter inserted into the V5 loop of the viral Env protein. Using this model, we quantified HIV-1 reactivation, as well as expression and surface presentation of Env after treatment with a panel of known latency reversal agents (LRAs) and their synergistically-acting combinations. HIV-1 reactivation with the PKC agonist Bryostatin-1 limited the cell-surface presentation of viral Env, a phenomenon we found being linked to the ability of Bryostatin-1 to induce the expression of the restriction factor GBP5 in T-cell lines and primary CD4+ T-cells, and induced a cellular state which was resistant to apoptosis. A combined treatment of Bryostatin-1 and the BET inhibitor (iBET) JQ1 resulted in synergistic HIV-1 reactivation and boosted levels of cell-surface Env, but failed to reduce resistance to apoptosis. In contrast, the combination of the SMAC mimetic (SMACm) AZD5582 and JQ1 markedly boosted cell-surface Env levels, without co-induction of GBP5, T-cell activation or apoptotic resistance. Crucially, HIV-1 Nef was found to be a potent antagonist of the cytotoxic killing of reactivating cells, most likely by its ability to inhibit apoptosis. Nef knockout, however, when paired with the AZD/JQ1 combination, displayed highest potency in inducing immune-mediated elimination of latently infected T-cells and presents a promising new approach for HIV cure programs.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

A.; Elkrewi, M.; Zajac, A. L.; Horne-Badovinac, S.; Matsubayashi, Y.", "abstract": "Collagens are fundamental components of extracellular matrices, requiring precise intracellular post-translational modifications for proper function. Among the modifications, prolyl 4-hydroxylation is critical to stabilise the collagen triple helix. In humans, this reaction is mediated by collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs). While humans possess three genes encoding these enzymes (P4Hs), Drosophila melanogaster harbour at least 26 candidates for collagen P4Hs despite its simple genome, and it is poorly understood which of them are actually working on collagen in the fly. In this study, we addressed this question by carrying out thorough bioinformatic and biochemical analyses. We demonstrate that among the 26 potential collagen P4Hs, PH4EFB shares the highest homology with vertebrate collagen P4Hs. Furthermore, while collagen P4Hs and their substrates must exist in the same cells, our transcriptomic analyses at the tissue and single cell levels showed a global co-expression of PH4EFB but not the other P4H-related genes with the collagen IV genes. Moreover, expression of PH4EFB during embryogenesis was found to precede that of collagen IV, presumably enabling efficient collagen modification by PH4EFB. Finally, biochemical assays confirm that PH4EFB binds collagen, supporting its direct role in collagen IV modification. Collectively, we identify PH4EFB as the primary and potentially constitutive prolyl 4-hydroxylase responsible for collagen IV biosynthesis in Drosophila. Our findings highlight the remarkably simple nature of Drosophila collagen IV biosynthesis, which may serve as a blueprint for defining the minimal requirements for collagen engineering.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Correction of RNA transcripts allows therapeutic gene editing in a safe and reversible manner and avoids permanent alterations in the genome. RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas nucleases (e.g., CRISPR-Cas13) enable delivery within a single adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector for RNA base editing, making the approach clinically feasible. Here, we used the inactive CRISPR-Cas13bt3 (also known as Cas13X.1) fused to the ADAR2 deaminase domain (ADAR2DD) for targeted correction of inherited retinal disease (IRD) mutations. First, we show in vitro that dCas13bt3-ADAR2DD can efficiently correct a pathogenic nonsense mutation (c.130C>T [p.R44X]) found in the mouse Rpe65 gene and recover protein expression in retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPEs). Across clinically reported RPE65 mutations, we observed editing efficiencies ranging from 0% to 60%. In the Rpe65-deficient mouse model of retinal degeneration (rd12), we observed that RNA base editing can recover Rpe65 expression in RPEs and rescue retinal function with no observable adverse effects. We further employed our RNA base editor against the large USH2A gene to assess the promise of RNA base editing for addressing untreatable IRDs caused by genes too large for AAV gene delivery. Against the human USH2A in vitro, we observed up to 60% on-target efficiency. We further found that gRNA mismatches, domain-inlaid ADAR2DD design and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the RNA base editor optimised on-target and bystander editing for a highly precise base editor. Against the mouse Ush2a in vitro, we similarly observed up to 60% on-target editing in mammalian cells, while in the Ush2aW3947X mice, we observed ~12% on-target editing, with no impact on retinal structure or function, or transcriptome-wide editing.

The cellular immune response (antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells and secreted cytokines) to human adenovirus (HAdV) infection is known to ameliorate symptoms and is critical for viral clearance. We hypothesised that the capsid proteins (hexon and penton) of HAdV-F40 and 41 (F40, F41) are evolving to escape cellular immune responses. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding of viral peptides is a key step in the presentation of peptide-MHC complexes which activate the T cell receptor and the cytotoxic T cell response. Methods Using global HAdV genomic data, we predicted MHC-peptide binding within the hexon and penton proteins of F40 and F41. We focused on MHC class I alleles common in the UK and Kenya and identifying predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes. Eight predicted epitope pairs from the F41 hexon were synthesised as 15mer peptides, comparing the wildtype (1970 F41 reference) to the variant (2019-2022) sequences. Cellular IFN{gamma} responses to these epitopes were measured in healthy donors using FluoroSpot assays. Results We identified multiple predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes shared between HAdV- species C and F, but also unique to species F, and epitopes unique to each genotype. We show that IFN{gamma} and IL2 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses to HAdV-F are ubiquitous among healthy adult donors from Cambridge, UK. Among predicted CD8+ epitopes within the F41 hexon, 11/16 peptides elicited donor positive IFN{gamma} responses from healthy donor PBMC (at least one epitope from seven out of eight peptide pairs). Conclusions The hexon and penton proteins of HAdV-F-40 and F41 are predicted to contain a number of genotype-specific, but conserved, CD8+ T cell epitopes which could be used to inform future vaccine design. Using the hexon of F41 as a case study, we show that predicted T cell epitopes in emergent strains are able to elicit an inflammatory cytokine response from healthy donor PBMC.

In this study, we report that the ability of Rv1250, a probable MFS-type transporter, influences the extrusion of multiple structurally unrelated classes of drugs, enhances the biofilm formation in E. coli and Mycobacterium smegmatis, and facilitates the survival of M. smegmatis cells inside the macrophage during antibiotic stress.

Several replication proteins are subsequently recruited to the active helicase, forming a replisome. The helicase must undergo dramatic conformational changes during its activation and this process is poorly understood, especially in metazoa. How the metazoan replicative helicase is activated, and which proteins promote this essential process are long-standing questions. Using a combination of single-molecule imaging and ensemble biochemistry, we show that Mcm10 and RecQL4 act in a concerted manner to activate replicative helicases. Mcm10 first binds to inactive helicases, then recruits RecQL4, which synergizes with Mcm10 to promote helicase activation. Mcm10 is not incorporated into replisomes and dissociates from origins during replication initiation. In the absence of Mcm10, RecQL4 is recruited to origins via an interaction with the Mcm7 subunit of the helicase.

There are several methods available to analyze adenine nucleotides, ranging from enzymatic assays to mass spectrometry approaches, however, to our knowledge, no method in the literature quantifies these six adenine nucleotides simultaneously, mostly due to limitations in sample preparation or detection methods. Here, we developed a method that can detect simultaneously ATP, ADP, ADP-ribose, AMP, NAD+ and NADH using RP-HPLC with UV-Vis detection.

The assessment of the reproducibility and reliability properties of FW-corrected DTI is a crucial factor in demonstrating the potential clinical utility of this refinement, particularly considering the examinations across multiple medical centres. This paper explores the variability, reliability, and separability properties of free-water volume fraction (FWVF) and FW-corrected DTI-based measures in healthy human brain white matter using publicly available test-retest databases acquired in 1) intra-scanner, 2) intra-scanner longitudinal and 3) inter-scanner settings under varying acquisition schemes. Three different estimation techniques to retrieve the FW-corrected DTI parameters tailored to single- or multiple-shell diffusion-sensitizing magnetic resonance (MR) acquisitions are investigated: i) a direct optimization of bi-tensor signal representation in the variational framework, ii) the region contraction-based approach, and iii) the spherical means technique combined with a correction of diffusion-weighted MR signal prior to DTI estimation. We found the previous suggestion (Hum. Brain Mapp., 38(1), 2017, 10.1002/hbm.23350) that the FW correction to DTI in a single-shell diffusion-weighted MR acquisition improves the repeatability and reliability of DTI-based measures may be data- and methodology-dependent, and does not generalise to multiple-shell scenario. Our experiments have shown that the most reliable and repeatable/reproducible measures, while preserving a moderate separability property, are fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity estimated in a multiple-shell variant under a combined FW-correction scheme. On the contrary, our results show evidence that the least reliable measures are the mean diffusivity estimated using any FW-correction procedure, as well as the FWVF parameter itself. These results can be used to establish the direction for selecting the most attractive FW-correction DTI scheme for clinical applications in terms of the variability-reliability-separability criterion.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

A first exposure to the phage may weaken the host defences and allow later infections to be successful. Because this cooperation requires sequential infections, the phage can invade the host population only if its initial density is sufficiently high in a well-mixed environment. However, most natural bacterial populations are spatially structured. Could spatial structure create more favourable conditions for viral spread? Here we study the effect of spatial structure on the dynamics of cooperative anti-CRISPR (Acr) phages spreading in a population of CRISPR-Cas resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. We show experimentally that spatial structure does not always promote the spread of Acr-phages. In particular, the effect of spatial structure is modulated by the efficacy of the bacterial hosts CRISPR-Cas resistance and by the efficacy of the phage Acr protein. These results are discussed in the light of a mathematical model we developed to describe the spread of the phage. The model allows us to understand the ambivalent effects of spatial structure via its effects on the reproduction and on the persistence of the phage. More generally, we find that spatial structure can have opposite effects on the epidemiological dynamics of the phage, depending on the properties of the Acr protein encoded by the phage. This joint experimental and theoretical work yields a deeper understanding of the spatial dynamics of cooperative strategies in phages.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate urolithin cross-feeding between members of the gut microbiota and discover a novel urolithin dehydroxylase in a subset of Enterocloster species.

However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of the injury-repair cycle remain incompletely understood. Methods: We employ spatial transcriptomics to create an atlas of the damage and repair response to ionizing radiation in the mouse intestine. We map molecular events driving epithelial recovery over a six-day period and 23 biological samples, spanning the early apoptotic response to tissue remodeling and repair. Results: The datasets capture mRNA of 19,042 genes in ~26 million bins at 2um resolution. Analysis revealed transcriptional patterns and niche signals that would remain undetected in bulk or single-cell approaches, including a non-random activation of interferon-target genes. Temporal shifts in cytokine and growth factor gene expression, particularly in the crypt and lower villus regions, corroborate published studies and reveal new predictions of the mechanisms governing intestinal healing. Global transcriptional upregulation was observed in the regenerating epithelium, suggesting hypertranscription is a hallmark of intestinal repair. Furthermore, we observe altered cellular differentiation trajectories and villus patterning at the early stages of regeneration.

The clinical phenotype includes systemic hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, and progressive vascular remodelling, features that are further exacerbated by increased oxidative stress. Given the early onset and progression of these cardiovascular manifestations, patients often require long-term pharmacological management from childhood. This raises important concerns about cumulative drug toxicity, dosing strategies, and the long-term safety of therapeutic interventions in pediatric populations. Using the Complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS, this study aims to evaluate whether pediatric-equivalent doses of Allopurinol (ALO) (20mg/kg/day equivalent to 1,66mg/kg/day in humans) a highly specific xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitor, and Losartan (LOS) (12,5 mg/kg/day equivalent to 1 mg/kg/day in humans) an angiotensin II type1 receptor antagonist, will exert beneficial effects on the cardiovascular phenotype of CD mice. To enable comparative analysis, the pharmacological effects of ALO and LOS were evaluated against both untreated CD mice and wild-type (WT) controls. In CD mice, both treatments significantly reduced systemic blood pressure; however, their effects on cardiac outcomes were different. While treatment with ALO improved cardiac pathology, treatment with LOS did not. ALO likely acts by reducing XOR protein levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NRLP3 activation. These findings support a therapeutic model in which minimal doses of ALO offers broader cardiovascular protection in WBS.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Besides yield reduction this fungus is also responsible for mycotoxin contamination of food and feed. Upon propagation under laboratory conditions, mutations may occur which would be disadvantageous for fungal fitness in nature but not in the lab where the strains are usually grown on nutrient-rich media under optimal growth conditions. In this study we characterized four phenotypically different Fusarium graminearum strains for fitness traits and compared their genomes to trace down mutations responsible for the phenotypes. Results: The four tested F. graminearum PH1-derived strains revealed differences in their phenotypic appearance and also in their secondary metabolite profiles expressed on different growth media. Also, two of the investigated strains (94 and 96) showed significantly reduced virulence on wheat upon point inoculation of flowering wheat. We identified one high impact mutation in each of the two strains. In strain 96 a loss of function mutation occurred in FGSG_00355 which has a high similarity to Ras GTPase activating proteins and consequently may have an impact on the cell cycle. Even though strain 96 showed enhanced DON production in vitro, the strain was no longer able to spread within the wheat ear in infection assays. In strain 94 we identified an insertion of an A rather at the end of FGSG_00052 leading to a frameshift and consequently mutation of the last three amino acids and a shift of the stop codon by seven amino acids. Even though knock-out of this putative transcription factor has been described by Son et al (2011) to have no impact on virulence, changes at the C-terminal region may result in changes of the binding affinity. Conclusions: We tracked down the mutations which might be responsible for the changes in phenotypic appearance, secondary metabolite profile as well as virulence. Yet, a closer biological characterization is necessary to determine the impact of these mutations on the fungus.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Here, using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we map the brain-wide distribution of inputs to frontal cortical pyramidal neurons. We discover that psilocybin's effect on connectivity is network-specific: strengthening the routing of inputs from perceptual and medial regions (homolog of default mode network) to subcortical targets, while weakening inputs that are part of cortico-cortical recurrent loops. The pattern of synaptic reorganization depends on the drug-evoked spiking activity, because silencing a presynaptic region during psilocybin administration disrupts the rewiring.

Glutamatergic synaptic activity is accompanied by large transient Na+ increases, but the spatio-temporal dynamics of Na+ signals and properties of Na+ diffusion within dendrites are largely unknown. To address these questions, we employed multi-photon Na+ imaging combined with whole-cell patch-clamp in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in tissue slices from mice of both sexes. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed a dendritic baseline Na+ concentration of ~10 mM. Using intensity-based line-scan imaging we found that local, glutamate-evoked Na+ signals spread rapidly within dendrites, with peak amplitudes decreasing and latencies increasing with increasing distance from the site of stimulation. Spread of Na+ along dendrites was independent of dendrite diameter, order or overall spine density in the ranges measured. Our experiments also show that dendritic Na+ readily invades spines and suggest that spine necks may represent a partial diffusion barrier. Experimental data were well reproduced by mathematical simulations assuming normal diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of DNa+= 600 m2/s. Modeling moreover revealed that lateral diffusion is key for the clearance of local Na+ increases at early time points, whereas when diffusional gradients are diminished, Na+/K+-ATPase becomes more relevant. Taken together, our study thus demonstrates that Na+ influx causes rapid lateral diffusion of Na+ within spiny dendrites. This results in an efficient redistribution and fast recovery from local Na+ transients which is mainly governed by concentration differences.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we leveraged a diurnal vertebrate model with higher genomic conservation, namely zebrafish, to screen our six highest confidence candidate genes and identify those whose loss-of-function impaired sleep characteristics related to human insomnia-like behaviors. Of these genes, we observed that CRISPR-mediated deletion of the zebrafish ortholog of MEIS1 produced nighttime specific sleep fragmentation and increased latency to sleep, pointing to a conserved role for MEIS1 in sleep maintenance. Comparing our human cell-based chromatin accessibility and contact maps with publicly available zebrafish spatial genomic data revealed highly conserved genomic architecture harboring the insomnia GWAS variant of interest. Notably, this genomic conservation was selective for the zebrafish ortholog which contributed to the sleep phenotype, meis1b, while the duplicated ohnolog meis1a proved dispensable. Motivated by this, we characterized the spatio-temporal expression of meis1b in zebrafish, showing it is comparable to human with respect to cerebellar granule progenitors.

Pavlovian fear and reward learning paradigms are widely used in preclinical research to probe mechanisms of valence learning but with limited consideration of sex as a biological variable despite known sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impaired valence. Here, we compare appetitive-only, aversive-only and mixed-valence cue-outcome Pavlovian conditioning paradigms in male and female mice to dissociate effects of context, valence and salience in a sex-specific manner. Using a data-driven approach to identify behaviors indicative of valence learning in an unbiased manner, we compare task performance between paradigms in male and female mice. We show that while male and female mice acquire appetitive and aversive associations in both single- and mixed-valence paradigms, sex differences emerge in single-valence paradigms. Ultimately, we show that these apparent sex differences in valence learning are driven by non-specific baseline differences in exploratory behavior. Males explore more at baseline, altering their trajectory of cue-reward association acquisition whereas females explore less at baseline, increasing shock facilitated freezing in aversive-only contexts, masking cue discrimination.

A balance of excitation and inhibition is necessary for normal social functioning, but it remains unclear how inhibition sculpts pyramidal activity to promote social behaviors. To address this question, we developed a novel social decision-making task in which female mice chose between social and non-social options. To explore the role of a task-relevant inhibitory subpopulation in social decision-making, we targeted neurons in the medial PFC (mPFC) expressing oxytocin receptors (OXTR neurons). Combining optogenetic inhibition of OXTR neurons with population calcium imaging of pyramidal neural activity, we found that OXTR neurons normally promote interaction with a male compared to a non-social alternative. OXTR neurons also regulate pyramidal activity, which enables a specific ensemble to represent the male option during decision-making. Computational modeling reproduced these findings through a pyramidal competition mechanism, in which regulation by OXTR neurons allows a male-representing pyramidal ensemble to effectively compete against the remaining pyramidal population to drive male choice. These results provide a potential mechanism by which PFC excitation-inhibition balance contributes to normal social functioning.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the first genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen targeting a Gq-coupled GPCR signaling cascade. Using a Drosophila model of adipokinetic hormone receptor (AkhR) signaling, we identified CG34449 (Zdhhc8), encoding a palmitoyl acyltransferase and its adapter protein CG5447, as a top hit required for robust Gq-mediated GPCR signaling. We show that Zdhhc8 enhances GPCR signaling through palmitoylation of Gq, which promotes its membrane localization and function. Loss of Zdhhc8 markedly reduces palmitoylation of Gaq resulting in attenuation of AkhR/Gq signaling and a reduction in receptor stability. Mechanistically, Zdhhc8 is necessary for palmitoylation of Gq. These findings uncover Zdhhc8-dependent Gq palmitoylation as a pivotal regulatory mechanism in GPCR signal transduction and highlight palmitoyl transferase as potential modulators of GPCR pathways.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

Spatially restricted induction of Wls denotes the earliest differentiation of non-telencephalic cells in human brain organoids. In zebrafish developing diencephalon, loss-of-Wls reduces the formation of habenula (HA) neurons but how Wls influences HA neurogenesis is unclear and whether Wls regulates gliocyte development is unknown. Here we report that the formations of cholinergic, substance P-ergic or glutamatergic neurons in HA are reduced differentially but the generation of gliocyte-derived choroid plexus (ChP) epithelia is increased in wls null mutants. At earlier stage, three-dimensional gene expression analyses revealed that while neurog1 expressions in HA progenitor zones are reduced, the expressions of Notch downstream effector her6 are increased and expanded into HA progenitor zones in wls mutants. Over-expressing Her6 in neurog1-positive cells reduced neurog1 expressions in HA progenitor zones. These results indicate that Wls restricts the expressions of Notch effector her6 to promote the specification of neurog1 proneurons and demotes the generation of ChP epithelia in zebrafish embryonic dorsal diencephalon.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}

M.; Cochran, J. N.", "abstract": "Understanding the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying brain function is crucial for advancing knowledge of the genetic basis of neurologic diseases. Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in gene regulation, and their evolutionary conservation can offer valuable insights. Importantly, the function and evolution of CREs are affected not only by primary sequence, but also by the cis- and trans-regulatory context. However, comparative functional analyses across species have been limited, leaving how these regulatory landscapes evolve in the brain largely unresolved. Here, we generated single-nucleus multiomic (snRNA- and snATAC-seq) data from cortex tissue across nine mammalian species and identified candidate CREs (cCREs) in a cell type-specific manner. We developed a multidimensional framework of conservation to assess sites of shared function that integrates sequence, chromatin accessibility, and enhancer-gene associations. Using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in human neural progenitor cells and neurons, we measured activity of cCREs including both conserved and human-specific regions. CRISPR interference validated conserved enhancer function, including at neurodevelopmentally important genes like FAM181B. Motif enrichment identified transcription factors distinguishing conserved versus recent cCREs. Linkage disequilibrium score regression indicated that both conserved and human-specific cCREs were enriched for neuropsychiatric GWAS risk, while neurodegenerative risk was confined to conserved elements. Our findings define functional dimensions of enhancer conservation and demonstrate how regulatory evolution shapes human brain biology and disease susceptibility.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": ""}
