J.", "abstract": "Calcium-sensitive fluorescence indicators allow us to monitor the spiking activity of large neuronal populations in animal models. However, despite the plethora of algorithms developed over the past decades, accurate spike time inference methods for spike rates greater than 20 Hz are lacking. More importantly, little attention has been devoted to the quantification of statistical uncertainties in spike time estimation, which is essential for assigning confidence levels to inferred spike patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce (1) a statistical model that accounts for bursting neuronal activity and baseline fluorescence modulation and (2) apply a Monte Carlo strategy (particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling) to estimate the joint posterior distribution of spike times and model parameters. Our method is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised algorithms by analyzing the CASCADE benchmark datasets. The analysis of fluorescence transients recorded using an ultrafast genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP8f, demonstrates our method's ability to resolve inter-spike intervals as short as five milliseconds. Overall, our study describes a Bayesian inference method to detect neuronal spiking patterns and their uncertainty. The use of particle Gibbs samplers allows for unbiased estimates of spike times and all model parameters, and it provides a flexible statistical framework to test more specific models of calcium indicators.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

J.; Wu, J.; Song, X.; Bradford, W. D.; Cook, M.; Unruh, J. R.; Halfmann, R.", "abstract": "How minute pathogenic signals trigger decisive immune responses is a fundamental question in biology. Classical signaling often relies on ATP-driven enzymatic cascades, but innate immunity frequently employs death fold domain (DFD) self-assembly. The energetic basis of this assembly is unknown. Here, we show that specific DFDs function as energy reservoirs through metastable supersaturation. Characterizing all 109 human DFDs, we identified sequence-encoded nucleation barriers specifically in the central adaptors of inflammatory signalosomes, allowing them to accumulate far above their saturation concentration while remaining soluble and poised for activation. We demonstrate that the inflammasome adaptor ASC is constitutively supersaturated in vivo, retaining energy to power on-demand cell death. Swapping a non-supersaturable DFD in the apoptosome with a supersaturable one sensitized cells to sublethal stimuli. Mapping all DFD nucleating interactions revealed that supersaturated adaptors are specifically templated by other DFDs in their respective pathways, limiting deleterious crosstalk. Across human cell types, adaptor supersaturation strongly correlates with cell turnover, implicating this thermodynamic principle in the trade-off between immunity and longevity. Profiling homologues from fish, sponge, and bacteria, we find nucleation barriers to be ancestrally conserved. These findings reveal DFD adaptors as biological phase-change materials that function like batteries, storing and privatizing energy for life-or-death decisions.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Inference on patients data with models trained on healthy population is not effective because of domain shift.

Here, we introduce PDGrapher, a causally inspired graph neural network (GNN) model that predicts combinatorial perturbagens (sets of therapeutic targets) capable of reversing disease phenotypes. Unlike methods that learn how perturbations alter phenotypes, PDGrapher solves the inverse problem of directly predicting the perturbagens needed to achieve a desired response by embedding disease cell states into networks, learning a latent representation of these states, and identifying optimal combinatorial perturbations. In experiments in nine cell lines with chemical perturbations, PDGrapher identifies effective perturbagens in more testing samples than competing methods. It also demonstrates competitive performance on ten genetic perturbation datasets. An advantage of PDGrapher is its direct prediction, in contrast to the indirect and computationally intensive approach traditionally used in phenotype-driven models. This approach accelerates training by up to 25 times compared to existing methods, providing a fast approach for identifying therapeutic perturbations and advancing phenotype-driven drug discovery.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Signaling pathways depend on negative and positive feedback loops (NFLs and PFLs) to regulate internal noise. Across diverse organisms, signaling is regulated by NFLs that function at different cellular locations. These range from NFLs functioning upstream near signal-receiving receptors to those downstream within the nucleus. While previous studies have examined the relationship between NFLs, internal noise in signaling pathways, and network topology, none have directly addressed how the cellular location of NFLs impacts noise regulation. This is significant given the almost ubiquitous presence of multi-level regulation systems within signaling pathways. Here, we use stochastic models inspired by Imd and Toll signaling to address this gap within the context of immune signaling. We use both mechanistic and evolutionary models to demonstrate how noise is regulated by NFLs and how this, in turn, affects the host's ability to fight off infection while minimizing immunopathologic effects of excessive immune gene expression. We found that downstream NFLs reduce noise in antimicrobial peptides (AMP) expression for some parameter values. On the other hand, upstream NFLs amplify the noise, but the presence of a strong PFL can reduce this noise. Our evolutionary simulations suggest that the mechanisms through which the downstream NFL operates within the cell can affect the evolution of the upstream NFLs. The results of our study provide insight into why distinct signaling pathways are regulated by varying numbers of NFLs, which operate in different cellular locations and employ diverse mechanisms to control gene expression.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

While actin filaments are central to cell morphogenesis and are typically regulated by biochemical signaling, cells can form protrusions even without clear external cues, suggesting the existence of intrinsic physical mechanisms. Here, we report that actin filaments undergo directional movement driven by treadmilling, an ATP-fueled polymerization-disassembly cycle intrinsic to actin. These Self-propelled Treadmilling Actin filaments (SpTAs), exhibit stochastic yet directional motion, in a manner similar to self-propelled \"particles\" rather than the previously reported reaction-diffusion \"waves\". SpTA arrival at the cell periphery drives membrane protrusion by orienting their polymerizing ends outwards. This SpTA accumulation, guided by nascent membrane curvature, further amplifies protrusion growth and expansion, driving cellular polarization for migration.

An open question is the ability of machine-learning approaches to predict enzymatic functions unseen in the training sets.

Here we demonstrate that loss of Arpc5 in the murine hematopoietic system, but not the corresponding Arpc5l isoform causes early-onset intestinal inflammation. This condition is initiated by microbiota breaching the ileal mucosa, leading to local and systemic inflammation. Macrophage and neutrophils infiltrate into the ileum, but in the absence of Arpc5 fail to restrict microbial invasion.

Restorers in cultivated crops are often alleles with strong and dominant effect, but in wild plants, data often suggest more complex systems. Here, we characterized the inheritance and specificity of restoration in a new CMS model, the freshwater snail Physa acuta. We explored two different populations (i) a naive population i.e., without contact with CMS in the past 80 generations, (ii) a non-naive population, where CMS is present and largely restored. Although we found male fertility of individuals with CMS mitogenomes to be heritable in both contexts, this genetic determinism was of a different nature depending on population history.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient disease, caused by the human-adapted members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). The outcome of TB infection and disease is highly variable, and co-evolution between human populations and their MTBC strains may account for some of this variability. Particular human genetic ancestries have been associated with higher susceptibility to TB, but socio-demographic aspects of the disease can confound such associations. Here, we studied 1,000 TB patients from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, together with their respective MTBC isolates, by combining human and bacterial genomics with clinical data. We found that the genetic background of the TB patient population was strongly influenced by the Bantu migrations from West Africa, which is in contrast to the corresponding MTBC genotypes that were mainly introduced from outside Africa. These findings suggest a recent evolutionary history of co-existence between the human and MTBC populations in Dar es Salaam.

Such detection involves receptors and bridging molecules that recognize lipids -normally restricted to the inner leaflet of healthy cells- which become exposed on the surface of dead cells and the vesicles they produce. A majority of studies focus on phosphatidylserine (PS) for which there are well-established receptors that either bind to the lipid directly or indirectly via intermediary proteins. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is even more prevalent than PS in the inner leaflet of mammalian cells and also becomes exposed by the action of scramblases during cell death, though little is known about the effects of PE once scrambled. Here, we report that PE can itself serve as a phagocytic ligand for macrophages by engaging CD300 family receptors. CD300a and CD300b specifically modulated PE-mediated uptake, and this process involved ITAM-containing adaptors and the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). For bacteria, which contain PE but largely lack PS in their membranes, we report that PE engagement enabled the binding and uptake of spheroplasts and extracellular vesicles (EVs) that were unsheathed by the cell wall. The inflammatory responses of macrophages to PE particles containing LPS was also curtailed by CD300a expression.

Here, we developed Genome Organization with CUT and Tag (GO-CaT) to determine the T1- and T2-LAD substructure of postmitotic excitatory neurons isolated from the prenatal and adult human cortex. While T1-LADs exhibited epigenomic features characteristic of stable, cell type-invariant LADs including strong transcriptional repression, in prenatal neurons, T2-LADs were enriched for promoter-enhancer DNA interactions, intermediate levels of gene expression, and levels. In prenatal neurons, T2-LADs marked genomic regions critical for neuronal development and enriched for genetic risk associated with neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders. In adult cortical neurons, T1-LADs were expanded in size and genomic coverage, incorporating the majority of the prenatal T2-LADs, sequestering genes involved in neurodevelopment. In contrast, the minority of prenatal T2-LADs that relocated to inter-LAD regions in adult neurons were enriched for processes related to synaptic function.

This site is thought to recognize oxidatively damaged G4, specifically those containing 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) modifications. We hypothesize that FANCJ AKKQ recognition of 8oxoG-modified G4s (8oxoG4s) depends on the sequence context, the position of the lesion within the G4, and overall structural stability. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we measured the binding affinities of a FANCJ AKKQ peptide for G4s formed by (GGGT), (GGGTT), and (TTAGGG) sequences. G4 conformation and thermal stability were assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Each sequence was modified to include a single 8oxoG at the first (8oxo1), third (8oxo3), or fifth (8oxo5) guanine position.

We observed the upregulation of symbiotic genes, such as Chalcone-flavonone isomerase 1 and SWEET10, accompanied by increased rhizosphere siderophore and root flavonoid in Clark. This indicates a significant role of microbes in mediating differential stress tolerance in soybean. Particularly, the combined stress led to distinct root and nodule microbiome dynamics, with Clark recruiting beneficial microbes such as Variovorax and Paecilomyces, whereas Arisoy exhibited the opposite pattern. In addition, Clark maintained nodule Bradyrhizobium and tissue nitrogen status, supported by ammonium retention and induction of Ammonium transporter 1 in the roots. Furthermore, in vitro compatibility between V. paradoxus and P. lilacinus suggests a synergistic interaction, with their localized signals benefiting Clark. Remarkably, enriched microbiomes significantly improved growth parameters, accompanied by elevated rhizosphere siderophore in sensitive genotypes under stress. This study is the first to uncover mechanisms of dual stress tolerance in soybean that may offer promising targets for breeding programs and microbiome-based biofertilizer strategies to improve combined stress tolerance in soybean and other legumes.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Despite this burden, natural immunity prevents disease in more than 90% of exposed individuals. Previous studies have identified interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) as a key regulator of innate immune defense against MTB. Here, we investigate the impact of IFN-{gamma} timing on macrophage-mediated control of MTB infection. We demonstrate that IFN-{gamma} exposure before infection enhances macrophage antibacterial activity, whereas post-infection exposure does not. Further investigation into this phenotype revealed a strong association between c-Myc signaling and macrophage function in MTB control, as identified using unbiased in vitro systems approaches. Given the challenge of perturbing c-Myc in primary cells, we developed a lentiviral system for c-Myc inhibition and overexpression. Using a tetracycline-inducible Omomyc system - a small peptide inhibitor of c-Myc - we show that c-Myc inhibition promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype with enhanced antimycobacterial activity. Mechanistically, c-Myc inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming via increased mTORC1 activity, leading to upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase and improved bacterial control. In vivo analyses, including murine models and human clinical histopathology, reveal a strong correlation between c-Myc expression and MTB persistence, as well as active tuberculosis (TB), suggesting a role for c-Myc in immune evasion. These findings reveal c-Myc as a potential mediator of immune privilege in MTB infection and highlight its role as a promising target for novel TB therapies aimed at enhancing macrophage function.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Although microsporidia are highly diverse and ecologically important to a broad range of hosts, previous research on genome architecture has focused primarily on the mammal-infecting genus Encephalitozoon. Here, we expand that work, testing the universality of the patterns observed in Encephalitozoon by investigating and comparing variation in genetic and epigenetic architectures in the high-quality genome assemblies of several major microsporidia clades. Our comparison of nine genomes, including the first genome assemblies of Binucleata daphniae, Gurleya vavrai, and Conglomerata obtusa, and revised, improved assemblies of Glugoides intestinalis and Ordospora colligata, found limited conservation of genetic and epigenetic architecture across all microsporidia, although many genomic characteristics, such as nucleotide composition and repeat content, were shared between genomes of the same or related clades. For example, rRNA genes were hypermethylated in all species, but their position close to chromosome ends was only found in the Encephalitozoon and its sister clade. GC-content varied widely, linked to genome size, phylogenetic position and activity of repeat elements. These findings enhance our insight into genome evolution and, consistent with findings from other systems, suggest epigenetic modification as a regulatory mechanism of gene expression and repeat element activity in microsporidia. Our comparative genome analysis reveals higher variation among microsporidia than previously supposed.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

We here contribute another piece to the puzzle by providing a high-quality reference genome for the Ural Owl (Strix uralensis), a species of conservation concern and efforts affected by habitat destruction and climate change. Results We generated a reference genome assembly for the Ural Owl based on high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. It figures amongst the best avian genome assemblies currently available (BUSCO completeness of 99.94 %). The primary assembly had a size of 1.38 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 90.1 Mb, while the alternative assembly had a size of 1.3 Gb and a scaffold N50 of 17.0 Mb. We show an exceptionally high repeat content (21.07 %) that is different from those of other bird taxa with repeat extensions. We confirm a Strix characteristic chromosomal fusion and support the observation that bird microchromosomes have a higher density of genes, associated with a reduction in gene length due to shorter introns. An analysis of gene content provides evidence of changes in the keratin gene repertoire as well as modifications of metabolism genes of owls. This opens an avenue of research if this is related to flight adaptations. The population size history of the Ural Owl decreased over long periods of time with increases during the Eemian interglacial and stable size during the last glacial period. Ever since it is declining to its currently lowest effective population size. We also investigated cell culture of progressive passages as a tool for genetic resources. Karyotyping of passages confirmed no large variants, while a SNP analysis revealed a low presence of short variants across cell passages. Conclusions The established reference genome is a valuable resource for ongoing conservation efforts, but also for (avian) comparative genomics research. Further research is needed to determine whether cell culture passages can be safely used in genomic research.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Although functional alterations in cortical circuits have been observed in preclinical PD models, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, we investigated tissue-level changes in the cortices of rats and mice treated with alpha-synuclein (aSyn) seeds using a multi-omics approach. Our study revealed significant phosphoproteomic changes, but not global proteomic or lipid profiling changes, in the rat sensorimotor cortex 3 months after intra-striatal injection with aSyn preformed fibrils (PFFs). Gene ontology analysis of the phosphoproteomic data revealed that PFF administration impacted pathways related to synaptic transmission and cytoskeletal organization. Similar phosphoproteomic perturbations were observed in the sensorimotor cortex of mice injected intrastriatally or intracortically with aSyn PFFs. Functional analyses demonstrated increased neuronal firing rates and enhanced spike-spike coherence in the sensorimotor cortices of PFF-treated mice, suggesting that aSyn seeds induced cortical circuit dysfunction. Bioinformatics analysis of the altered phosphosites indicated the involvement of several kinases, including casein kinase-2 (CK2) and MAPK (ERK), both of which have been previously implicated in PD pathology. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of phosphorylation-mediated signaling pathways in the cortical response to aSyn pathology spread in PD and related synucleinopathies, setting the stage for developing new therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

However, integrating these data types remains challenging due to distributional discrepancies and distinct feature spaces. To address this, we present a novel single-cell Contrastive INtegration framework (sCIN), that integrates different omics modalities into a shared low-dimensional latent space. sCIN uses modality-specific encoders and contrastive learning to generate latent representations for each modality, aligning cells across modalities and removing technology-specific biases. The framework was designed to rigorously prevent data leakage between training and testing, and was extensively evaluated on three real-world paired and unpaired datasets including SHARE-seq, 10X PBMC (10k version), and CITE-seq. Paired datasets refer to multi-omics data generated using technologies capable of capturing different omics features from the same individual cells whereas unpaired datasets are collected from different but similar cell populations within the same tissue, with each modality measured separately. Results on paired and unpaired datasets show that sCIN outperforms state-of-the-art models, including scGLUE, scBridge, sciCAN, Con-AAE, Harmony, and MOFA+, across multiple metrics: Average Silhouette Width (ASW) for clustering quality, Recall@k, Cell type@k, Cell type accuracy, and Median Rank for integration quality.

Humans can also transmit viral infections back to domestic and wild animals, which can then act as reservoir for the maintenance of viruses, with the risk of epidemic diseases re-emergence. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the COVID-19, likely originated from wildlife and has already been evidenced to be transmitted from humans to captive, domestic and wild animals. In particular, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) show high-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following human contamination, and recent data suggest that white-tailed deer could act as an emerging virus reservoir. Here, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 could also have emerged in several longitudinally-monitored populations of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in direct contact with humans in France. We performed indirect tests (serological ELISAs and seroneutralization) on serum collected pre- and post-emergence of the virus in human populations. We also performed direct tests (nasal swabs followed by RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those populations in 2022. We also investigated the exposure and prevalence of the virus in three other cervid species in France. ELISA tests were positive for 2.20 % of the sera tested, both pre- and post-emergence of the virus, but all positive samples were negative with seroneutralization. Direct PCR testing showed no positive results in 2022. Thus, although seroprevalence increased after the COVID-19 emergence (2022) in one out of three roe deer population, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has not emerged in those populations, and that ELISA cross-reaction with another circulating virus, possibly an unidentified bovine coronavirus, is possible.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Immunostaining studies have revealed an accumulation of p-tau in the AD retina and suggested it may reflect tau pathology in the brain. To validate these findings and further investigate the relationship between retinal and brain tau pathology, we used mass spectrometry to measure p-tau peptides in matched retinal and hippocampal samples from non-demented controls (NC, n=8), AD ( n=12), and MS (n=4). We analysed the differences in p-tau levels between diagnoses and explored how retinal p-tau variants correlate with hippocampal p-tau and neuropathological changes. Our results revealed peaks corresponding to tau peptides phosphorylated at T181, S199/S202, T231, T231+T235, S396+T403/S404, and T403/S404.

Total tau phosphorylation and phosphorylation at S199/S202 and T231 were significantly higher in the retina of AD cases compared to NC. These two peptides, along with peptides phosphorylated at S396+T403/S404, were also higher in cases with high amyloid-beta (A{beta}) Braak stages compared to those with low A{beta} Braak stages.

Despite their therapeutic importance, key aspects of AAV natural biology remain obscure, complicating efforts to explain rare AAV-associated diseases and optimize gene therapy vectors. By analyzing sequence data from virus isolates and endogenous viral elements (EVEs), I reveal a striking evolutionary pattern: while AAV sub-lineages, defined by the replication-associated (rep) gene, have broadly co-diverged with host groups over millions of years, capsid (cap) diversity has been shaped by extensive recombination. In particular, one capsid lineage, Mammalian-wide (M-wide), has spread horizontally across diverse rep lineages and host taxa through multiple recombination events. Furthermore, several AAVs with M-wide capsids - including AAV-4, AAV-12, and bovine AAV (BAAV) - originate from historical adenovirus (Ad) stocks, raising the possibility that laboratory conditions contributed to capsid transfer. Distinguishing natural from laboratory-driven recombination is essential for understanding AAV ecology and its implications for gene therapy.

I.", "abstract": "Transposons, or \"jumping genes,\" are mobile genetic elements that reshape genomes. The Tc1/Mariner family, including Tc3a transposase, has been studied for decades, but key aspects of its DNA recognition and cleavage remain unresolved. Existing models propose a homo-dimeric process for DNA excision and integration, yet conflicting hypotheses exist about the initial steps of DNA cleavage and target site recognition. Here, we reveal a previously unrecognized base-flipping mechanism in Tc3a transposase that challenges long-standing models of Mariner transposon activity. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation induces a structural shift in the transposase-DNA complex, forcing a nucleotide in the inverted repeat to flip outward. This base-flipping event alters the local DNA conformation, creating torsional strain that may facilitate transposon inverted terminal repeat association. Unlike prior models, which assumed the entire protein, or protein dimers, were needed to illicit DNA interactions necessary for any types of torsion, our findings indicate that transposase bipartite binding itself actively reshapes DNA structure. We further show that this mechanism is dependent on the bipartite helix-turn-helix domains, which differentially contribute to DNA stabilization and recognition. Our simulations also reveal that the processed N-terminus plays an unexpected role in modulating DNA binding affinity, contradicting previous assumptions that it was structurally inconsequential. Together, the two helix-turn-helix motifs act to propagate the force caused by base flipping along one direction of the cognate DNA double helix axis. The fact that previous structural studies lacked this amino acid modification may explain why this mechanism was overlooked. These results provide a new framework for understanding transposase-DNA interactions, highlighting how a single molecular modification can trigger major DNA rearrangements. This discovery not only redefines the Tc3a transposition process but also calls for a reassessment of long-standing Mariner family transposon models.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Using fMRI data from 772 participants performing an extensively-validated language localizer paradigm that isolates language processing from other processes, we a) delineate a comprehensive set of areas that respond reliably to language across written and auditory modalities, and b) evaluate these areas' selectivity for language relative to a demanding non-linguistic task. In line with prior claims, many areas outside the core fronto-temporal network respond during language processing, and most of them show selectivity for language relative to general task demands. These language-selective areas of the extended language network include areas around the temporal poles, in the medial frontal cortex, in the hippocampus, and in the cerebellum, among others. Although distributed across many parts of the brain, the extended language-selective network still only comprises ~1.2% of the brain's volume and is about the size of a strawberry, challenging the view that language processing is broadly distributed across the cortical surface.

To investigate this, we studied 23 neurotypical (NT) and 23 high-functioning adults with ASD performing a probabilistic two-alternative value-based task while undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometry. The task comprised five sequential blocks with stable reward probabilities (70%:30%), but varying stimulus pairs and reward values, enabling the assessment of behavioral and neural adaptation to expected uncertainty. We analyzed the hit rate of advantageous choices, response times, and computational measures of prior belief strength and precision. To examine cortical activation during decision-making, we used magnetoencephalographic (MEG) source reconstruction to quantify -{beta} oscillation suppression in decision-relevant cortical regions within the pre-decision time window. Linear mixed models were applied to assess trial-by-trial effects. Behaviorally, ASD participants exhibited lower overall belief precision but intact probabilistic rule generalization, showing gradual performance improvement and strengthening of prior beliefs across blocks. However, unlike NT individuals, they did not show a progressive downscaling of neural activation during decision-making or a reduction in neural response to feedback signals as performance improved. Furthermore, on a trial-by-trial basis, increased belief precision in ASD was not associated with reduced cortical activation, a pattern observed in NT individuals. These findings suggest an atypically rigid and enhanced allocation of neural resources to advantageous decisions that individuals with ASD rationally judge as optimal.

We introduce a set of standardised tractography protocols for delineating tracts between the cortex and various deep subcortical structures, including the caudate, putamen, amygdala, thalamus and hippocampus. To enable comparative studies, our protocols are designed for both human and macaque brains. We demonstrate how tractography reconstructions follow topographical principles obtained from tracers in the macaque and how these translate to humans. We show that the proposed protocols are robust against data quality and preserve aspects of individual variability stemming from family structure in humans. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of these species-matched protocols in mapping homologous grey matter regions in humans and macaques, both in cortex and subcortex.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

One consequence of this arbitrariness is taxonomic synonymization, wherein variation determined not unique enough to constitute distinct species gets merged into one. Synonymization is non-random and subject to taxon and trait-specific biases. We explore these trends using a comprehensive dataset of the world's marine species for all large phyla and Animalia. We match all accepted species-names from the present day with their synonyms and calculate metrics of synonymization including the time lag between the years of descriptions of a species and its newest synonym. We find that although species description trends across phyla show no consistent, discernible trends, the fraction of names that gets synonymised remains initially constant across phyla, with a subsequent gradual decrease. Most accepted species described around the early 20th century possess synonyms created in the same year, indicating synonyms arising due to new name combinations, suggesting a distinct period of taxonomic praxis. This period was followed by a period of most species descriptions lacking synonyms on moving towards the present. Across taxa, we find the mean lag to be strongly negatively correlated to time, with time not being a limiting factor determining this trend. We also find the number of synonyms per accepted name to also be strongly negatively correlated to time in a taxon-independent manner. Our study considers when the diversity characterising species in the form of once-unique species-names becomes known to science. Our results suggest that across taxa, species described more recently encompass less biological variability, indicating a gradual change in how morphologically delineated species which comprise the vast majority of species described across time are described.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

M.; Iruzubieta, P.; Fernandez-Lopez, R.; Crespo, J.; de la Cruz, F.", "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a multifactorial condition influenced by the gut microbiome (GM). While previous studies have reported inconsistent associations between MASLD and key microbial clades using low-resolution 16S rRNA profiling, we employed high-resolution metagenomic sequencing and multi-marker taxonomic classification across three independent cohorts to identify robust microbial and functional signatures of MASLD. We consistently detected a depletion of Agathobacter rectalis, a known butyrate producer, in MASLD patients. Functionally, MASLD was characterized by a depletion of genes involved in butyrate and methane biosynthesis -particularly within the crotonyl-butyryl-CoA axis- alongside an enrichment of genes driving the production of endogenous alcohols such as ethanol and 1-propanol. Genes encoding these fermentative pathways, often organized in operons like pdu and tor, were more abundant in MASLD samples, indicating a potential shift toward alcohol-producing metabolism. These geno-metabolic changes were accompanied by a broader displacement of beneficial taxa and an increase in accessory gene content across the GM, underscoring the limitations of taxonomy-based disease associations. Many of the differentially abundant genes were also found on plasmids, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer contributes to strain-level metabolic variability relevant to MASLD progression. Our findings support a model in which GM-driven metabolic shifts -rather than taxonomic changes alone- play a central role in MASLD pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of functional and mobile genetic element profiling for uncovering mechanistic links between the microbiome and liver disease.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Using confocal and super-resolution imaging, we characterized the spatial distribution BetaII-spectrin and the assembly pattern of the MPS in human MN axons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discovered a striking gap-and-patch pattern in the medial axon, where sharply demarcated BetaII-spectrin gaps alternate with patches containing a well-organized MPS. The pattern is acutely induced by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine and pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization prevents patch formation, indicating a requirement for actin nucleation in MPS assembly.

M.; Wick, R. R.; Iqbal, Z.", "abstract": "Accurate detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes is essential for the surveillance, epidemiology and genotypic prediction of AMR. This is typically done by generating an assembly from the sequencing reads of a bacterial isolate and running AMR gene detection tools on the assembly. However, despite advances in long-read sequencing that have greatly improved the quality and completeness of bacterial genome assemblies, assembly tools remain prone to large-scale errors caused by repeats in the genome, leading to inaccurate detection of AMR gene content and consequent impact on resistance prediction. In this work we present Amira, a tool to detect AMR genes directly from unassembled long-read sequencing data. Amira leverages the fact that multiple consecutive genes lie within a single read to construct gene-space de Bruijn graphs where the k-mer alphabet is the set of genes in the pan-genome of the species under study. Through this approach, the reads corresponding to different copies of AMR genes can be effectively separated based on the genomic context of the AMR genes, and used to infer the nucleotide sequence of each copy. Amira achieves significant improvements in genomic copy number recall and nucleotide accuracy, demonstrated through objective simulations and comparison with alternative read and assembly-based methods on samples with manually curated truth assemblies. Applied to a dataset of 32 Escherichia coli samples with diverse AMR gene content, Amira achieves a mean genomic-copy-number recall of 98.4% with precision 97.9% and nucleotide accuracy 99.9%. Finally, we show that Amira consistently detects more true AMR genes across all E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. faecium nanopore datasets from the ENA (n=8580, 2448 and 415 respectively) than an assembly-based approach.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

In a large cohort of patients (n=38) with hippocampal damage due to autoimmune limbic encephalitis, we had reported evidence that extra-hippocampal structural and functional abnormalities in the broader hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network fully mediated the effects of hippocampal damage on several aspects of episodic memory. However, we had not examined the specific diencephalic nuclei affected or the white matter pathways that would help explain these remote effects. In this study, we used recently developed methods of automated segmentation of diencephalic nuclei, as well as a range of analyses of white matter integrity. As expected, we found atrophy in the anterior thalamic nuclei and in the mammillary bodies, but also in the laterodorsal, pulvinar, and dorsomedial nuclei. The extent of atrophy in some of these nuclei was comparable to, if not larger than that observed for the hippocampal formation, even though none of our patients' acute clinical scans disclosed thalamic damage. We also present evidence linking these volumes to patients' episodic memory impairment over and above any correlation with hippocampal/subicular subfield volumes. White matter integrity was strongly compromised in the hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network, and the volumetric relationship between the hippocampal formation and the mammillary bodies was at least partly mediated by the integrity of the fornix across patients, consistent with the assumption of Wallerian degeneration following focal medial temporal lobe damage. However, evidence for the specialisation of the hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network in recollection/recall was mixed, and white matter abnormalities extended to regions well beyond this network. Our findings highlight the need to longitudinally examine diencephalic and white matter integrity in cohorts of hippocampal damage with different aetiologies and update neuroanatomical models of this network.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Decreased GCase activity has also been observed in sporadic PD cases, supporting a broader role for GCase in the poorly understood mechanisms underlying PD etiopathogenesis. While most studies on the relationship between GBA mutations and PD have focused on neurons, evidence suggests that PD pathology promoted by GCase deficiency involves other cell types and, in particular, interactions between neuronal and glial cells. Here, we identify microglia as primary players undergoing significant alterations at early stages of the pathological processes triggered by a GCase impairment. Using both pharmacological and genetic mouse models of GCase deficiency, we observed microglial morphological, transcriptional and metabolic changes. Interestingly, these changes were associated with a cell-specific, significant reduction of microglial ATP levels. When microglial ATP depletion was reproduced in an in vitro system of co-cultured microglial and neuronal cells, the neuroprotective properties of microglia were compromised and neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress was enhanced. These findings underscore the role of microglia in PD pathogenesis and point to a pathogenetic mechanism by which microglial metabolic disturbances leading to ATP depletion enhance neuronal vulnerability to injury and neurodegeneration. This mechanism could be targeted for therapeutic intervention aimed at mitigating PD risk and counteracting the development of PD pathology.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

These protein accumulations are thought to be caused by impaired waste removal. In an alternative hypothesis, we have proposed the existence of an extensive glial canal system that is likely formed by myelinated aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-expressing tanycytes and removes cellular waste from the hippocampal formation. Here, we demonstrate that tanycyte-derived waste-internalizing receptacles are immunoreactive for A{beta} and emanate from specialized nucleus-like organelles in the following referred to as 'tanysomes.' Utilizing RNA-scope in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that these receptacle-forming tanysomes express RNA for AQP4 and the A{beta}-related genes, amyloid precursor protein, and presenilin 1. These findings suggest that A{beta} is likely synthesized where receptacle formation is observed and that A{beta} may play an important structural role in receptacle formation. In AD-affected hippocampus excessive amounts of A{beta}-immunoreactive waste receptacles emerge from tanysomes and have the appearance of plaques in A{beta}-immunolabeled hippocampus. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same receptacle-forming organelles exhibit strong immunolabeling for hyperphosphorylated tau protein in AD-affected tissue. We postulate that both proteins may play important structural roles in waste uptake and that hypertrophic swelling of impaired tanycytes in AD-affected brain may be due to obstructions of this extensive interconnected glial canal system.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

We and others have shown that activation of the Hedgehog and TGF-beta signalling pathways is required to initiate tail regeneration. In this study we initially focus on these two pathways to better understand their role regeneration. We have found that Hedgehog signalling acts upstream of the TGF-beta pathway by activating transcription of the TGF-beta ligand tgfb1a. We have identified differentially expressed genes that are regulated after tail excision as well as those that are dependent upon TGF-beta signalling. From this analysis we found that Keratin genes fall into categories of co-expression: one set that is upregulated by TGF-beta signalling after injury (krtup) and a second set that is downregulated (krtdown). To see whether these two sets show co-expression more broadly, we analysed single cell RNA sequencing data and found that krts fall into the same categories during zebrafish development. We have mapped the expression of a representative member of krtup (krt97) and krtdown (krt5) sets during development and regeneration and show that krt97 is found in epithelia that is moving and krt5 is expressed in epithelia that is stationary. Based upon our results we propose that the krtup set allows for collective epithelial migration while the krtdown set inhibits mobility.

V.", "abstract": "In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Method: Thirty healthy adults completed speaking and reading tasks while performing a concurrent working memory task. In speaking blocks, participants produced monosyllabic words, whereas in reading blocks, they silently read them. During each trial, participants categorized an auditory probe stimulus positioned between the vowels /{varepsilon}/ and /ae/. Trials were classified as congruent or incongruent depending on whether the vowel maintained in working memory matched the auditory target. Perceptual sensitivity and speech variability were measured across conditions.\n\nResultsIn the speaking condition, participants showed higher perceptual sensitivity in congruent trials compared to incongruent trials, indicating that maintaining a vowel in working memory biased auditory target perception during speech planning. No such effect was observed in the reading condition. Additionally, participants exhibited a trend of reduced speech variability in congruent compared to incongruent trials, suggesting that working memory modulates speech outcome. No significant relationship was found between changes in perceptual sensitivity and speech variability across subjects.\n\nConclusionThese findings suggest that maintaining a vowel in working memory shapes auditory target representations and modulates speech outcomes.

Here, we report the production of a high affinity nanobody against PstS-1 protein of Mtb which helps bacilli in phosphate uptake as well as host cell adhesion. C8 nanobody was isolated from a phage display library displaying nanobodies which was constructed from a camel immunized with secretory proteins of Mtb. C8 Nb was characterized in vitro and in vivo for its immunoreactivity against PstS-1 protein. Ability of C8 Nb to bind PstS-1 protein present on the surface of Mtb bacilli or adhered on macrophages and its localization around BCG cells injected intramuscularly in mice demonstrate its potential in the development of molecular imaging for tuberculosis.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

The use of Eco CRISPR-Cas3 to plants is challenging because 7 CRISPR-Cas3 components (6 Cas proteins and CRISPR RNA) must be expressed simultaneously in plant cells. To date, application has been limited to maize protoplasts, and no mutant plants have been produced. In this study, we developed a genome editing system in rice using Eco CRISPR-Cas3 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Deletions in the target gene were detected in 39-48% and 55-71% of calli transformed with 2 binary vectors carrying 7 expression cassettes of Eco CRISPR-Cas3 components and a compact all-in-one vector carrying 3 expression cassettes of Cas proteins fused to 2A self-cleavage peptide, respectively. The frequency of alleles lacking a region 7.0 kb upstream of the PAM sequence was estimated as 21-61% by quantifying copy number by droplet digital PCR, suggesting that mutant plants could be obtained with reasonably high frequency. Deletions were determined in plants regenerated from transformed calli and stably inherited to the progenies. Sequencing analysis showed that deletions of 0.1-7.2 kb were obtained, as reported previously in mammals. Interestingly, deletions separated by intervening fragments or with short insertion and inversion were also determined, suggesting the creation of novel alleles. Overall, Eco CRISPR-Cas3 could be a promising genome editing tool for gene knockout, gene deletion, and genome rearrangement in plants.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

EVs were separated by differential centrifugation followed by size exclusion chromatography and characterized using nanoflow cytometry, single-particle reflectance imaging sensing (SP-IRIS), and transmission electron microscopy. EV size, yield, and morphology did not differ significantly between MS and control samples. Proteomic analyses revealed downregulation of synaptic and mitochondrial proteins and upregulation of complement and inflammatory proteins and pathways in MS WM EVs. This suggests that EVs reflect ongoing synaptic pathology, metabolic dysfunction, and CNS-compartmentalized inflammation and that they may actively contribute to these pathological processes. Deconvolution analyses suggests a shift in EV cellular origin, with an increased astrocytic and decreased neuronal EV contributions in MS.

Using an engram tagging and manipulation approach in mice, here we provide evidence that intra-regional changes in organization underlie shifts in memory resolution. We establish that contextual fear memories lose resolution as a function of time, with mice exhibiting conditioned freezing in both the training apparatus (context A) and a second apparatus (context B) at more remote delays (freezingA {equiv} freezingB at remote delay). By tagging either hippocampal (dentate gyrus) or cortical (prelimbic cortex) neuronal ensembles in context A, and then pairing their optogenetic activation with shock (in context C), we monitored the resolution of these artificially-generated memories at recent versus remote post-conditioning delays by testing mice in contexts A and B. Hippocampal engrams for a fear conditioning event were initially high-resolution (recent delay: freezingA >> freezingB) but lost resolution with time (remote delay: freezingA {equiv} freezingB). In contrast, cortical engrams were initially low-resolution and remained low-resolution over time (recent and remote delay: freezingA {equiv} freezingB).

Q.; Soma, K.", "abstract": "Neuroestrogens are synthesized in the brain and regulate social behavior and cognition. In the song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), 17{beta}-estradiol (17{beta}-E2) promotes aggression, even during the non-breeding season, when circulating 17{beta}-E2 levels are low. Measuring estrogens is challenging due to their low concentrations and the limited sensitivity of many existing assays. Moreover, estrogens other than 17{beta}-E2 are often overlooked. Here, we developed a method for simultaneous measurement of eleven estrogens that is highly specific, sensitive, accurate, and precise. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with derivatization of estrogens by 1,2-dimethylimidazole-5-sulfonyl-chloride (DMIS) to enhance sensitivity. We included four 13C-labeled internal standards, which corrected for matrix effects when measuring catecholestrogens and methoxyestrogens. This method greatly improves upon our prior protocol, which could measure only four estrogens and included only one deuterated internal standard. Then, the new method was applied to samples from male song sparrows exposed to either a simulated territorial intrusion (STI) or a control condition during the breeding season or non-breeding season. Only estrone and 17{beta}-E2 were present in blood and brain, while the other nine estrogens in the panel were non-detectable. As expected, there was large regional variation in neuroestrogen levels and very low estrogen levels in blood. There was large seasonal variation, and estrogen levels were lower in the non-breeding season. Despite robust aggressive responses to the STI, estrogen levels did not differ between STI and control subjects in either season. In sum, our novel method enables ultrasensitive measurement of eleven estrogens and will be useful for studies of songbirds and other animals.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Voluntary movements elicit cortical activity that contain elements related to both motor planning and sensory activity. However, automatic movements that do not require conscious processing, for example grooming or drinking, are to a large extent controlled by subcortical systems such as the brainstem. While the cortex may not be required to generate these automatic behaviors, it is unclear whether cortical activity represents the movements associated with them. In this work, we use a simple procedure to stimulate stereotyped grooming behaviors in the head-fixed mouse while measuring neuronal function across the dorsal cortex. We find specific cortical representations of grooming both at a mesoscale network-level and single-cell resolution. Mesoscale cortical activation was most prominent at the onset of grooming episodes, and declined to baseline levels despite continuous engagement in the behavior. Further stratification of grooming component movements revealed that more directed and unilateral grooming movements had greater cortical associated responses than more stereotyped bilateral movements. These findings help to frame the impact of forms of automatic movements on large scale cortical ensembles and suggest they engage specific and transient cellular and regional cortical ensembles.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Some demand fast learning rates, while others benefit from using slower ones. To adjust learning rates, people could rely on either global, meta-learned differences between environments, or faster but transient adaptations to locally experienced prediction errors. Here, we introduce a new paradigm that allows researchers to measure and empirically disentangle both forms of adaptations. Participants performed short blocks of trials of a continuous estimation task - fishing for crabs - on six different islands that required different optimal (initial) learning rates.\n\nAcross two experiments, participants showed fast adaptations in learning rate within a block.

This fMRI study fills that gap by varying the number of English words presented while holding the amount of visual stimulation constant. We adapted the ''simultaneous suppression'' paradigm, which has demonstrated that the response to multiple stimuli presented simultaneously is typically smaller than the sum of responses to the same stimuli presented sequentially. On each trial, participants viewed rapid sequences of three frames. Each frame contained two character strings, most of which were pseudo-letters with visual features matched to familiar letters. The experimental conditions differed in the number of English words in the sequence: zero words; one word; two words sequentially; or two words simultaneously. Behaviorally, participants performed worse at detecting two words presented simultaneously than sequentially. In the brain, the BOLD response increased linearly with the number of words presented in several reading-related regions of the left hemisphere: the inferior frontal sulcus, the intraparietal sulcus, the superior temporal sulcus, and text-selective occipito-temporal regions. But the mean response magnitudes did not differ between sequential and simultaneous presentation of two words. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of ventral temporal text-selective regions to two words' lexical frequencies was attenuated by simultaneous presentation. This suggests that words were processed less deeply when they competed simultaneously. Our new paradigm, therefore, reveals processing capacity limits in the reading circuitry.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that dendritic inhibition terminates plateaus in an all-or-none manner. Plateaus were initially resistant to inhibition but became increasingly susceptible to termination as they progressed. Between two distinct subtypes of dendrite-targeting interneurons, OLMNdnf generated slower postsynaptic currents that terminated plateaus more effectively than OLM2. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) were necessary for plateaus, which were prolonged by blocking small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK). A single-compartment model with these two conductances recapitulated core experimental findings and provided a mechanistic explanation for terminations. Plateaus arose from VGCCs maintained in the active state by sustained Ca2+ influx, a positive feedback loop that was quasi-balanced by ISK. Inhibition terminated plateaus by driving the membrane potential below a dynamic threshold to deactivate VGCCs and end the positive feedback loop. Lastly, two-photon Ca2+ imaging showed that plateaus evoke large dendritic Ca2+ transients that were graded by terminations. Overall, our results demonstrate how the feedback inhibitory circuit interacts with intrinsic cellular mechanisms to regulate plateau potentials and shape dendritic Ca2+ signals in CA1-PYRs.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Recent research has demonstrated the importance of hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing neurons in driving hedonically-motivated feeding and in forming these associations. The MCH system interacts with mesolimbic dopamine (DA) transmission, offering a potential mechanism for the effects of MCH neurons on hedonic feeding and associative conditioning. However, this interaction has not been fully characterized in vivo with modern approaches that offer high temporal and spatial resolution. We characterized MCH-DA interactions during feeding and food-motivated Pavlovian conditioning using in vivo fiber photometry in the lateral hypothalamus/zona incerta (LH/ZI) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). We found that MCH neuron activity and DA release in the medial-shell of the NAc (mNAcSh) were co-activated during consumption and in response to reward-predicting cues. During consumption, DA release preceded MCH activity, while responses to reward-predicting cues emerged in MCH neurons earlier than in the DA system. Lastly, gain and loss-of function of the MCH system bidirectionally modulates DA release in the mNAcSh. These results indicate that physiological co-activation of the MCH and DA systems occurs during food-motivated learning, and demonstrate a capacity for bidirectional modulation of DA release in the mNAcSh by the MCH system.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

However, genetic studies have been limited by the lack of adequate genetic tools. Here, we established an antimetabolite-based transformation system, originally developed for ascomycetes, for use in P. chrysosporium. The transformation system utilizes pyrithiamine (PT), a thiamine antimetabolite, in combination with the pPTRII vector that contains the PT resistance gene (ptrA). PT effectively inhibited the growth of P. chrysosporium, and the introduction of ptrA conferred resistance to transformant mycelia. The transformation efficiency was comparable to that in ascomycetes, suggesting that the transformation system is also applicable to basidiomycetes. To examine the suitability of the system for heterologous gene expression, four cassettes were constructed to express GFP under the promoters of the actin1, DED, and GAPDH genes. Promoter activities were assessed via fluorescent microscopy observation of transformant mycelia and GFP quantification in crude cell extracts, revealing that the actin1 promoter drove the highest level of expression. Furthermore, truncating repeat sequences of the autonomously replicating sequence in the vector backbone improved transformation efficiency, likely due to the reduction in vector size. The transformation efficiency of the gene cassette-inserted vector in P. chrysosporium was relatively higher than that reported with alternative transformation systems in other species of wood-decaying basidiomycetes. The present transformation system could provide a platform for protein expression and genetic engineering in P. chrysosporium and potentially in other wood-decaying basidiomycetes.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we discovered that NTM such as M. abscessus exhibit exceptional tolerance to ultra-high electric field strengths, and that hypertonic preconditioning partially protects cells from electroporation-induced damage. Using ultra-high electric field strength (3kV/mm) electroporation, we achieved dramatic improvements in plasmid transformation efficiency--up to 106-fold in M. abscessus, 83-fold in Mycobacterium marinum, and 24-fold in Mycobacterium kansasii--compared to standard conditions (1.25kV/mm). Transformation efficiency was further influenced by the choice of selectable marker. Ultra-high field strength electroporation also markedly enhanced allelic exchange in M. abscessus expressing Che9c RecET recombinases, increasing recovery of gene deletion mutants by over 1,000-fold relative to conventional electroporation. In parallel, oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering for targeted point mutations produced nearly 10,000-fold more mutants under ultra-high field conditions.

Here, we demonstrate that reduced NMNAT1 enzyme function due to the p.V9M mutation leads to DNA damage in PRs, characterized by the progressive accumulation of the oxidative DNA adduct 8-oxo-dG in Nmnat1V9M/V9M mutant mice. Cells with oxidative DNA damage also demonstrate DNA double-strand breaks, as evidenced by co-staining with antibodies to phosphorylated H2AX ({gamma}H2A.X).

To reconcile these views, we introduce a novel conceptual framework of \"signaling homeorhesis\". Unlike homeostasis, homeorhesis describes the stable evolution of signaling trajectories over time. Defining this concept quantitatively using a dynamical systems framework, we use mathematical models of the Epidermal Factor Growth Receptor (EGFR) and the Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) networks, as well as available experimental temporal protein activity recordings in PC-12 cells to demonstrate that cells classify GF signals to unique signaling trajectories that encode for distinct cell phenotypes, irrespective of the GF identity.

Here, we show that a fraction of Cdc13 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm just prior to mitosis. This export could be critical to propagate CDK activity throughout the cell. Mutating three Cdc13 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) led to precocious enrichment of Cdc13 in the cytoplasm but did not accelerate mitotic entry, indicating that the export is not sufficient to trigger entry into mitosis. The export coincides with spindle pole body integration into the nuclear envelope and may be required to coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling required for this integration.

To address this question, we use microneedle manipulation to apply local force to spindle microtubule bundles, kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers), inside mammalian cells. We show that local load directly fractures k-fibers, and that newly created plus-ends often have arrested dynamics, resisting depolymerization. Force alone, without fracture, is sufficient for spindle microtubule stabilization, as revealed by laser ablating k-fibers under local needle force. Doublecortin, which binds a compacted microtubule lattice, is lost around the force application site, suggesting local force-induced structural remodeling. In turn, EB1, which recognizes GTP-tubulin, is locally enriched at stabilization sites, both before and after force-induced fracture. Together, our findings support a model where force-induced damage leads to local spindle microtubule lattice remodeling and stabilization, which we propose reinforces the spindle where it experiences critical loads.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

DNACipher takes 196 kb of genome sequences as input and imputes variant effects across 38,582 cell type-assay combinations. DNACipher generates predictions for >7 times as many contexts as Enformer, which allows for better detection of variant effects at expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We also introduce DNACipher Deep Variant Impact Mapping (DVIM), a method to identify variants with molecular effects at genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. Application of DVIM to type 1 diabetes (T1D) reduced the mean fine-mapping credible set size from 24 to 1.4 variants per signal. DVIM variants had significantly higher fine-mapping posterior probabilities, and their predicted effects were supported by single-nucleus ATAC-seq and luciferase assays. DVIM also detected 6547 rare variants with molecular effects at 96% of GWAS T1D loci, and these were enriched for associations with immune traits. In summary, DNACipher DVIM prioritises common and rare variants at GWAS loci by predicting molecular effects across a broad range of contexts.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

However, most publicly available sleep classifiers are trained on scalp EEG from traditional polysomnography (PSG) data, and thus generalize poorly to forehead EEG due to differences in electrode placement, referencing montages, and higher susceptibility to artifacts from user movements and electrode displacement. Conventional classifiers typically do not explicitly account for these artifacts, resulting in inaccurate and misleading sleep stage scoring. To address this gap, we developed a suite of artifact-aware sleep stage classifiers trained specifically using forehead EEG data, leveraging two comprehensive datasets --Wearanize+ and Donders2022-- that contain concurrent forehead EEG and clinical PSG recordings. We further introduce two classifier variants: one optimized for real-time applications that operates directly on raw EEG amplitudes, and another optimized for offline analysis utilizing normalized EEG signals. Validation results indicate robust and reliable classification performance across standard sleep stages (Wake, N1, N2, N3, REM), along with effective identification of artifact epochs. Importantly, the developed classifiers generalize well to forehead EEG devices beyond the original training platform.

C.", "abstract": "Introduction: Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in India, with conventional chemotherapy often limited by drug resistance, off-target toxicity, and metastasis promotion. These treatments indiscriminately attack rapidly dividing cells, including healthy tissues and immune cells, leading to severe side effects and weakened antitumor immunity. Hence, alternative strategies are needed to selectively target cancer cells while minimizing collateral damage. Methods: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated, cultured up to passage 4 (P4), and characterized via flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry for stemness markers. Their differentiation potential was validated using adipogenic and chondrogenic lineage assays. The MSC-derived secretome, collected under hypoxic conditions, was analyzed for its cytotoxic effects on cancer cells using MTT, TMRM staining, and scratch assays. NanoLC-MS/MS profiling and STRING-DB analysis identified key proteins involved in apoptosis, tumor suppression, and DNA damage response. Results: P2 secretomes exhibited the highest protein concentration and strongest cytotoxic effects. UCSC-derived secretomes showed superior anti-cancer activity, significantly reducing cancer cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and migration. Dose-dependent studies revealed up to 95% cancer cell death with UCSC secretome, while ADSC secretome achieved 80%. In contrast, HEK293-derived secretomes had minimal effects. LC-MS profiling identified tumor-suppressive and apoptosis-inducing proteins, with unique protein signatures distinguishing UCSC and ADSC secretomes. STRING analysis mapped key regulatory pathways in tumor inhibition. Conclusion: MSC-derived secretomes, particularly from UCSCs, effectively target aggressive breast cancer cells while sparing normal cells, offering a promising alternative to conventional therapies. Future research should optimize secretome formulations, identify key bioactive components, and validate their efficacy in in vivo models and clinical trials to advance this therapy toward clinical applications.

Transcriptomic co-expression network analysis identified gene expression modules specific to each cell type and infection state, and revealed that wMel tailors its gene expression to host context. In macrophage-like host cells, wMel expresses pathogenic effectors, whereas in neuron-like cells, wMel upregulates metabolic genes. Micro-C chromatin contact data revealed that many of these infection-induced changes are epigenetically encoded, with wMel infection conferring reduced chromatin contacts and widespread transcriptional derepression in D. melanogaster.

Using primary CFs and in vivo mouse models, we found that Lmna mutations impact various aspects of CF function. Both knockdown and point-mutant models impaired CF proliferation and contraction whereas other functions appear to be mutation-dependent. Simultaneous Lmna deletion in cardiomyocytes and CFs delayed disease progression, improved cardiac function, and prolonged survival, indicating that Lmna mediate an opposing balance between cardiomyocytes and CFs in driving disease pathogenesis.

Influenza A virus (IAV) faces similar constraints during infection but may have evolved strategies to enhance the biogenesis of its own membrane proteins. One such protein, the viroporin M2, contains functionally essential hydrophilic residues within its transmembrane domain, which should hinder efficient membrane insertion. We hypothesize that IAV has adapted to overcome these sequence-based limitations and ensure robust M2 biogenesis. Using a biotin pulse-labeling system in intact cells, we uncover the dynamics of M2 targeting and ER insertion. Attenuating the insertion rate by ablating a key insertion factor, the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), leads to M2 accumulating in the cytosol, but remaining partially insertion competent. We find that cytosolic stability of non-inserted M2 is crucial for efficient biogenesis under these conditions and identify amphipathic helix-mediated membrane association as the molecular mechanism that counteracts proteasomal degradation. We propose membrane association as a novel buffering mechanism that regulates membrane protein biogenesis by stabilizing pre-insertion intermediates.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Given the wide host and cellular tropism of IAV, the virus likely evolved mechanisms to leverage host translocation pathways efficiently. We demonstrate that although M2 utilizes the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), driven by signals encoded in its transmembrane and C-terminal domains, M2 maintains an approximately 50% membrane insertion rate in the absence of the EMC. This influences viral cell-to-cell transmission across different IAV strains, with a greater impact on those expressing lower levels of M2.

The ED is a simple organ made up of secretory epithelial cells that are encased by extracellular matrix and a layer of innervated contractile muscle. These secretory cells are post-mitotic and lack known stem cells or progenitors in the adult, but they are not fully quiescent. They undergo a variant cell cycle called endoreplication immediately post-eclosion to increase organ size and protein synthesis capacity. Polyploid and post-mitotic tissues often face unique challenges in response to cell loss due to their inability to proliferate. Here, we show that the adult ED is capable of significant recovery after cell loss due to a combination of increased nuclear and cellular hypertrophy that partially restores tissue mass and organ function. The early cell cycle plasticity of this adult tissue is critical for this recovery, as older tissues that have few or no endocycles exhibit reduced capacity for recovery after cell loss. Together, our findings establish the Drosophila ED as a model to study post-mitotic polyploid tissue repair and highlight a combination of endocycles and hypertrophy as a key mechanism for functional regeneration in the absence of mitosis.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Cultured cells under physical confinement have been shown to experience mechanical stress due to deformation of the nucleus. Nuclear deformation can lead to loss of nuclear integrity and DNA damage, and it has been proposed to underlie cancer initiation and progression. In vivo, the consequences of physical confinement on physiological, developmental cell migration remain so far unexplored. Here, we use the zebrafish neural crest as an in vivo model to address how multipotent embryonic cells respond to physical confinement during developmental migration. By measuring the extracellular space from head to tail along the embryonic body axis, we found that the level of tissue scale confinement increases along the antero-posterior axis. We found that neural crest experience dramatic nuclear deformation during their migrating between adjacent tissues, which quantitatively scales with tissue confinement. By using complementary genetic and mechanical strategies to ablate the surrounding tissue, we observe a rescue of nuclear deformation in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that while deformation of the NC nucleus causes stretching of the nuclear envelope, it does not cause DNA damage even upon extreme deformations. Instead, cells adapt, by decreasing both their DNA damage and LaminB2 levels upon entering confined spaces. In summary, we establish the neural crest as a physiological framework uncovering a dynamic adaptation to tissue confinement in vivo.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

As cells differentiate collectively, it raises the question of how tissue-level properties affect instructive cues of decision-making. Here, we show that a tissue rigidity phase transition guides patterning by tuning the length-scales and time-scales of morphogen signalling. By combining rigidity percolation theory, reaction-diffusion modelling, quantitative imaging, optogenetics and single-cell transcriptomics in zebrafish, we uncover dynamical global tissue rigidity patterns that actively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient by restricting ligand dispersal and accelerating its signalling activity. In this self-generated mechanism, Nodal, besides driving meso-endoderm fate specification, increases cell-cell adhesion strength via regulating planar cell polarity genes. Once adhesion strength reaches a critical point, it triggers a rigidity transition which collapses tissue porosity. The abrupt tissue reorganisation negatively feeds back on Nodal signalling impacting both its length-scales, by limiting Nodal diffusivity, and its time-scales, by speeding up the expression of its antagonist Lefty, thereby ensuring timely signal termination and robust patterning.

Many genetic mutations that cause HCM enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for beta-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to WT. This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin.ADP 5-fold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase Vmax 2-fold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed (SRX-DRX) regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosin's off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

However, they present challenges, and as such researchers have resorted to utilizing deep learning to automatically classify acquired data therefore expediting the review process. While this practice is common in field studies it has been less adopted in zoo monitoring. In this paper we deploy the YOLOv10x model to monitor four species at Knowsley Safari in the UK: African lions (Panthera leo), Southern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum simum), Grevys zebra (Equus grevyi) and Olive baboons (Papio anubis). Camera trap images were processed and classified using the Conservation AI desktop application. The raw images were saved to facilitate the comparative analysis of the models predictions against the findings of human observed images. Processing time for both methods was compared using a subset of 3015 images with Conservation AI, reducing the time required to classify the images by 82% compared to a human analyst. Confusion matrix results showed high accuracy rates for all four species (>0.90). Analysis of count data showed significant differences in three species, where the human observer recorded more observations of each than Conservation AI (lion, rhino, baboon p<0.005). However, no significant difference was seen in zebra (p>0.05). A strong positive correlation in count data between both methodologies was seen in all species; baboon (rho=0.955, p<0.005), lion (rho = 0.969, p<0.005), rhino (rho=0.887, p<0.005) and zebra (rho=0.843, p<0.005).

In this study, we developed a nanopocket membrane that can capture nanoparticles and extracellular vesicles in tangential flow filtration by pulling the species of interest into a nanopocket, while tangential flow washes away particles too large to be captured. We developed the pores using a four-step lithography process. By optimizing photolithography parameters, particularly exposure dose, we achieved well-defined pore shapes with the desired wall tilt, forming nanopocket geometries. We validated membrane performance using bead mixtures of varying diameters (50 nm - 10 microns), demonstrating its ability to pass small particles, capture mid-sized particles, and exclude larger ones. Surface modification with poly(l-lysine)- grafted poly(ethylene glycol) enhanced this performance by reducing pore size and improving particle release. Additionally, we demonstrated selective capture and release of liposomes as well as EVs in the presence of fluorescently labeled BSA (f-BSA) protein. During this process, EVs were retained and later released, while f-BSA passed through, confirming selective capture and reduced protein contamination. These PEGylated nanopocket membranes constitute a low- pressure platform for gentle, size-selective isolation of nanoscale bioparticles, laying the groundwork for improved extracellular-vesicle analytics and point-of-care diagnostic applications.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we present OriGene, a self-evolving multi-agent system that functions as a virtual disease biologist, systematically identifying original and mechanistically grounded therapeutic targets at scale. OriGene coordinates specialized agents that reason over diverse modalities, including genetic data, protein networks, pharmacological profiles, clinical records, and literature evidence, to generate and prioritize target discovery hypotheses. Through a self-evolving framework, OriGene continuously integrates human and experimental feedback to iteratively refine its core thinking templates, tool composition, and analytical protocols, thereby enhancing both accuracy and adaptability over time. To comprehensively evaluate its performance, we established TRQA, a benchmark comprising over 1,900 expert-level question-answer pairs spanning a wide range of diseases and target classes. OriGene consistently outperforms human experts, leading research agents, and state-of-the-art large language models in accuracy, recall, and robustness, particularly under conditions of data sparsity or noise. Critically, OriGene nominated previously underexplored therapeutic targets for liver (GPR160) and colorectal cancer (ARG2), which demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in patient-derived organoid and tumor fragment models mirroring human clinical exposures.

L.; MacKintosh, F. C.; Janmey, P. A.", "abstract": "Biological tissues experience mechanical compression under various physiological and pathological conditions and often exhibit compression stiffening, in which their stiffness increases during compression, a phenomenon that plays a crucial role in regulating cell behavior and maintaining mechanical homeostasis. However, most isolated biopolymer networks, such as fibrin and collagen hydrogels that form the extracellular matrix and actin network that forms the internal cytoskeleton, undergo compression softening, raising questions about how tissues achieve compression stiffening despite the softening properties of their extracellular and intracellular matrix components. Previous studies have shown that spherical inclusions at large volume fractions can induce compression stiffening in biopolymer networks, but they do not account for the effects of aggregation and irregular morphologies of cellular assemblies or other components in tissues. Here, we demonstrate a novel mode of compression stiffening induced by aggregated or irregularly shaped inclusions that occurs at significantly lower volume fractions. Using carbonyl iron particles and coffee ground particles, we find that the morphological diversity of inclusions enables tissue-like compression stiffening at a low volume fraction of inclusions. Through a set of experiments and computational analyses, we demonstrate that these particles can percolate at low volume fractions. We further show that the percolation of stiff inclusions creates a stress-supporting network and enables tension-dominated stress propagation in fibrin fibers, both of which drive macroscopic stiffening during compression. These findings provide insights into the regulation of tissue stiffness and have implications for designing biomaterials with physiologically relevant mechanical properties for biomedical applications.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Population structure analyses indicate that the Middle Eastern region was the centre of origin of common vetch, which then entered Europe in two distinct waves. One wave propagated by humans through Turkey into the Carpathian Basin before spreading throughout Europe via Danubian and Mediterranean routes. Demographic inferences revealed a significant bottleneck for all common vetch groups initiated during the Last Glacial Maximum, followed by an expansion that coincides with the onset of the warm Holocene epoch and the Neolithic Revolution.

However, the scalability of surveys is often limited by the effort, time and cost needed to deploy, maintain and retrieve sensors. Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) are emerging as a promising tool for fully autonomous data collection, but there is considerable scope for their further use in ecology. In this study, we explored whether a novel approach to UAV-based acoustic monitoring could detect biodiversity patterns across a varied tropical landscape in Costa Rica. We simulated surveys of UAVs employing intermittent locomotion-based sampling strategies on an existing dataset of 26,411 hours of audio recorded from 341 static sites, with automated detections of 19 bird species (n = 1,819) and spider monkey (n = 2,977) vocalisations. We varied the number of samplers deployed in a single survey (sampling intensity) and whether the samplers move between sites randomly, in a pre-determined route to minimise travel time, or by adaptively responding to real-time detections (sampling strategy) and measured the impact on downstream ecological analyses. We found that observed avian species richness and spider monkey occupancy was not impacted by sampling strategy, but that sampling intensity had a strong influence on downstream metrics. Whilst our simulated UAV surveys were effective in capturing broad biodiversity trends, such as spider monkey occupancy and avian habitat associations, they were less suited for exhaustive species inventories, with rare species often missed at low sampling intensities. As autonomous UAV systems and acoustic AI analyses become more reliable and accessible, our study shows that combining these technologies could deliver valuable biodiversity data at scale.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Our analysis reveals that estimates of total forest area at the CONUS scale differ by over 2,000,000 km^2, and correlations among forest change estimates vary widely in both direction and statistical significance. To support dataset selection and interpretation, we developed an open-access map comparison tool using Google Earth Engine.

This study investigates the functional specialisation of coelomocytes within the two main echinoderm body fluids, namely the perivisceral fluid (PF) from the perivisceral cavity and the hydrovascular fluid (HF) from the hydrovascular--ambulacral system. Given their specific distribution restricted to the HF, hemocyte-like cells (HELs) are particularly investigated. In echinoderms, hemocytes have been described as reddish cells containing haemoglobin and thus presenting a function in oxygen transport. Using an integrative approach combining cell morphological analyses, pigment profiling and multi-omics technologies, we demonstrate, in the sea cucumber Holothuria forskali, that HELs harbour exceptionally high concentrations of carotenoids, primarily canthaxanthin and astaxanthin--potent antioxidant molecules responsible for their pigmentation. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses reveal that HELs express candidate genes involved in the carotenoid metabolism pathway as well as catalase, an antioxidant enzyme. Additionally, spectral flow cytometry assays reveal that HELs do not produce reactive oxygen species in contrast to most coelomocyte types, reinforcing the hypothesis of their antioxidant function. HELs also contribute to the formation of large red bodies (i.e., coelomocyte aggregates) and increase in concentration following lipopolysaccharide injections, indicating an active role in immune defence. Given these results, we hypothesise that these cells act after the culmination of the immune response, forming an antioxidant shell around the cellular aggregates to mitigate oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced within the aggregate while encapsulating pathogens, thus protecting the host tissues. The discovery of carotenoid-carrying coelomocytes constitutes the first report of pigmented coelomocytes in sea cucumbers (except respiratory pigments), challenging the long-standing assumption that these cells contain haemoglobin. Therefore, we propose renaming hemocytes into carotenocytes, at least in this species. However, we think that this newly described coelomocyte type has been wrongly identified as haemoglobin-containing cells in many previous studies and could be present in many other holothuroid species. Our findings thus establish a new paradigm in the study of coelomocytes in echinoderms as well as the function of the hydrovascular system, unique to this phylum.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we constructed the chromosome-level genome of the sweet potato rot nematode and confirmed its genome comprises four chromosomes through Hi-C and karyotype analysis. Comparative analysis with two migratory PPNs, B. xylophilus and A. besseyi, revealed that the Nigon elements of B. xylophilus are largely conserved with those of the model organism C. elegans, whereas D. destructor and A. besseyi underwent extensive Nigon element recombination. Notably, these recombination events were highly correlated with their colinearity of protein sequences. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis across five developmental stages of D. destructor identified numerous stage-specific effectors and transcription factors. RNAi experiments demonstrated that these genes play crucial roles in embryonic development and parasitic capability. Overall, this study not only provides valuable genomic and transcriptomic resources for PPNs but also uncovers key aspects of their genome evolution and parasitic gene functions.

However, existing platforms only partially satisfy these requirements. In this study, we present the OrganoidChip+, an all-in-one microfluidic device designed to integrate both culturing and HCI of ASOs all within one platform. We previously developed the OrganoidChip as a robust imaging tool. Now, the OrganoidChip+ incorporates several additional features for culturing organoids in addition to fluorescence staining and imaging without the need for sample transfer. The organoids grown within a culture chamber are stained and then transferred to immobilization chambers for blur-free, high-resolution imaging at predetermined locations. We cultured adult stem cell-derived intestinal organoids in the chip for 7 days and tracked growth rates of each organoid using intermittent brightfield images, followed by multiple image-based assays, including viability assay using widefield fluorescence imaging, a redox ratio assay using label-free, two-color, two-photon microscopy, and immunofluorescence assays using confocal microscopy. These assays serve as proof-of-concept to showcase the chip's capabilities in HCI of ASOs. Organoids cultured in the chip exhibited superior average growth rates over those in traditional Matrigel dome cultures, off-chip. Viability and redox ratio measurements of on-chip organoids were comparable or slightly better than their off-chip counterparts.

Here, we present an alternative approach based on solid-supported inverse lipid bilayers (ILBs) in which two hydrophilic monolayer surfaces face each other across a thin water layer, as evidenced through x-ray reflectometry. The water uptake as a function of the dehydrating osmotic pressure is precisely measured with the help of ellipsometry under controlled humidity conditions. The measurements reproduce the known hydration decay lengths of interacting phospholipid membrane surfaces and of interacting glycolipid membrane surfaces. In addition, we present pressure-distance curves of the interaction between two dissimilar membrane surfaces, with phospholipids on one side and glycolipids on the other side.

RNAseq-based comprehensive analyses of alternative RNA splicing (AS) in HFD-fed mice for 1 or 6 weeks and in PQBP1-cKO mice reveal their common changes, which weigh on synapse-related genes. Betweenness-based extraction of core molecules from the common changes reveals CASK, Cacnb1 and Cyfip2 as key molecules of the network.

Their genetic data are only available from historical museum specimens, so it is based on highly fragmented and damaged DNA. Poor sequence recovery in these \"antique\" samples can bias phylogenetic inference which often results in exceptionally long terminal branches in the phylogeny. These long branches can distort estimates of phylogeny, an artifact known as long branch attraction. However, the best way to analyze this data is unclear because these long branches are typically artifactual, reflecting DNA quality. We investigated the position of Mohoidae within the superfamily Bombycilloidea using published alignments of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and re-assembled UCEs from raw sequencing reads. The uncertainty involves two monotypic families (Hypocoliidae and Hylocitreidae). Re-aligning UCEs using a smaller taxon set closely related to Mohoidae, along with edge trimming and reassembly, eliminated the long branches of Mohoidae and Hypocoliidae (also represented by an antique sample). The sister relationship of these two families in previous studies appears to be artifactual; our new analyses yielded congruent topologies that placed Mohoidae as sister to a clade comprising Hypocoliidae and Hylocitreidae. We also found that different assemblers (SPAdes vs Trinity) yielded sequences with conflicts towards the ends of the UCEs, especially for the antique samples, although this did not alter the topology. Finally, combining the UCEs with legacy data allowed us to produce a strongly supported complete phylogeny of Bombycilloidea the included all extant species as well as the extinct Mohoidae.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

To simulate cholinergic dysfunction, we administered scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, which produced dose-dependent declines in accuracy and reaction time. Mild and severe impairment levels were identified within each animal. We then tested three compounds: nicotine, guanfacine, and donepezil. Nicotine, a nicotinic receptor agonist, fully restored performance across both impairment levels, suggesting potential benefit in both early and advanced AD. Guanfacine, an 2A adrenergic agonist, improved accuracy only under mild impairment, while donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, showed inconsistent effects. None of the compounds reversed scopolamine-induced slowing of reaction time, indicating specificity for attentional control. These findings highlight the utility of the NHP CPT as a pharmacologically sensitive model for detecting attentional dysfunction and evaluating pro-cognitive therapeutics in aging and neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Prior research has identified regional deficits in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), a measure of vascular reserve, in patients with CAD. However, the impact of these cerebrovascular deficits on cognition has not been explored, nor has the effect of CAD on cerebral metabolic health. This study aims to fill these gaps by investigating how CAD influences cerebral vascular and metabolic health, and how these alterations relate to cognitive function across multiple domains. Methods: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was employed to measure a comprehensive profile of cerebral vascular and metabolic health, including CBF, CVR, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Cognition was assessed using a validated neuropsychological battery from which composite scores were extracted, reflecting executive functions, working memory, processing speed, and verbal episodic memory. Results: A total of 35 patients with CAD and 37 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. Patients with CAD demonstrated widespread impairments in both cerebral vascular and metabolic health, characterized by lower CBF , CVR, and CMRO2, and increased OEF, indicative of insufficient oxygen delivery. Notably, lower CVR was associated with poorer executive function, suggesting a specific role of vascular reserve for preserving executive functions. Furthermore, higher OEF was associated with poorer working memory, showing the importance of preserved oxygen consumption for maintaining cognitive function. Conclusion: This study reveals that CAD is associated with impaired cerebral vascular and metabolic health, providing a pathological basis for cognitive decline. Specifically, reduced CVR and elevated OEF emerged as sensitive biomarkers linking impaired brain health and cognition. These markers hold promise for guiding future interventions aimed at preserving cognitive health in patients with CAD.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the site fidelity and habitat use of juvenile yellow morphotype green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the Gulf of Santa Elena, north Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Fifteen juvenile yellow morphotype green turtles (49 - 83 cm curved carapace length; CCL) were monitored for 19 - 629 days with an array of 11 acoustic receivers placed within 5 main habitat types: muddy areas, reef patches, macroalgae, rocky reefs, and mangroves. Daily and seasonal locations of the turtles were estimated using a positioning estimation algorithm to determine the site fidelity and habitat use within the study area. Large juveniles ([&ge;]65 CCL) were detected disproportionally in the macroalgae habitat during the upwelling season (43.9% detections) from December - April, and in the reef patch habitat during the non-upwelling season (36.0%) from May to November. Small juveniles (< 65 cm CCL) had more detections in the reef patch habitat during both seasons (Upwelling: 35.4%, non-upwelling: 45.4%) relative to other habitats sampled. More than half of the turtles monitored (67%) showed strong site fidelity to the study area, ranging from 68.9 to 100% from October 2020 to September 2022. Our results suggest that juvenile yellow morphotype green turtles, particularly larger individuals, have a strong association with coral / rocky reef patches and macroalgae habitats, similar to adults.

The complex domestication history of G. hirsutum combined with reciprocal introgression with a second domesticated species, G. barbadense, has generated a wealth of morphological forms and feral derivatives of both species and their interspecies recombinants, which collectively are scattered across a large geographic range in arid regions of the Caribbean basin. Here we assessed genetic diversity within and among populations from two Caribbean islands, Puerto Rico (n = 43, five sites) and Guadeloupe (n = 25, one site), which contain putative wild and/or introgressed forms. Using whole-genome resequencing data and a phylogenomic framework derived from a broader genomic survey, we parsed individuals into feral derivatives and truly wild forms. Feral cottons display uneven levels of genetic and morphological resemblance to domesticated cottons, with diverse patterns of genetic variation and heterozygosity. These patterns are inferred to reflect a complex history of interspecific and intraspecific gene flow that is spatially highly variable in its effects. Wild cottons in both Caribbean islands appear to be relatively inbred, especially the Guadeloupe samples. Our results highlight the dynamics of population demographics in relictual wild cottons that experienced profound genetic bottlenecks associated with repeated habitat destruction superimposed on a natural ecogeographical distribution comprising widely scattered populations. These results have implications for conservation and utilization of wild diversity in G. hirsutum.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Antidepressants, including SSRIs, SNRIs, NRIs, NDRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, and PDE4 inhibitors, consistently improved DRL performance, increasing reinforcers earned and inter-response times while decreasing response rates. In contrast, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and psychostimulants without serotonergic or noradrenergic engagement failed to enhance performance. Critically, the primate DRL task identified antidepressant-like efficacy of PDE4 inhibitors, while also capturing emesis, a dose-limiting side effect not observable in rodent models. These findings validate the primate DRL task as a pharmacologically selective and translationally relevant platform for screening novel antidepressant therapies.

However, how different treatment strategies, such as abstinence versus extinction training, modulate the underlying neural circuits and synaptic mechanisms that shape relapse vulnerability remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that abstinence and extinction distinctly influence dorsomedial striatal (DMS) direct-pathway medium spiny neuron (dMSN) activity and dopamine signaling during cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. Using in vivo fiber photometry in D1-Cre rats expressing calcium or dopamine sensors, we found that abstinence enhanced dMSN calcium responses and dopamine release during reinstatement, whereas extinction normalized these neural signals and suppressed relapse-like behavior. Furthermore, bidirectional optogenetic modulation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-to-dMSN synapses revealed a causal role for corticostriatal plasticity in determining relapse propensity. Inducing long-term depression (LTD) in the abstinent state attenuated reinstatement, while inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) after extinction training reinstated alcohol seeking. Together, these findings identify distinct neural adaptations shaped by abstinence versus extinction and highlight corticostriatal plasticity as a potential target for relapse prevention.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

We tested relationships between eggshell maculation, surface temperature, hormone concentrations before and during incubation, and embryonic growth in Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs developing while artificially incubated in duplicate incubators. We detected 10 steroid hormones in the yolks during development and concentrations of all hormones declined to Day 15 (~2 days before hatch). Steroid declines at Day 9 of incubation were related to eggshell surface temperature, with warmer eggs having higher concentrations of androgens and progestogens, and incubator assignment, as eggs were warmer on average in one incubator than the other. However, eggshell surface temperature was not related to eggshell maculation, embryonic size, or embryonic heart rate during development.

E.", "abstract": "Neurofibrillary tangles are dynamic neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease with a hypothesized lifespan morphologically-defined by three maturity levels: pretangles, mature tangles, and ghost tangles. To better understand the progression of tangle pathophysiology, we characterized tangle maturity level predilection of 15 tau antibodies recognizing a broad range of linear, phosphorylation, conformational, and truncation epitopes in the hippocampus of 24 postmortem brains. We developed the tangle maturity scoring system to semi-quantitatively evaluate each tangle maturity level. Based on proportions of tangle maturity levels, we classified antibodies as \"early\" (mostly pretangles and mature tangles), \"middling\" (mature tangles with pretangles and ghost tangles), and \"advanced\" (mostly ghost tangles and mature tangles) tangle maturity markers. To summarize tangle maturity predilection, we developed the tangle maturity scale to integrate individual tangle maturity scores. Correlations showed stronger relationships between tangle maturity scale and subsector thickness for more advanced tangle maturity markers in CA1 and subiculum, whereas Braak tangle stage remained consistently correlated throughout markers of the tangle lifespan. To aid in scoring hippocampi, we used machine learning to recognize tangle maturity levels, which performed comparably to a domain expert and showed similar relationships by Spearman correlation. Pattern recognition software was used to assess tangle and neuritic tau burden separately, which generally correlated with Braak stage and neuronal counts. However, tangle-derived tau burden more consistently correlated with hippocampal subsector thickness. In conclusion, we developed manual and automated scoring systems to evaluate tangle maturity levels, demonstrating early 4R, phosphorylated, and oligomeric tau accumulation preceding more advanced 3R and truncated tau. Our study provides supportive evidence of disease-relevant ordering of tau posttranslational modifications in the brain, which may have implications for theragnostic development.

Here, we introduce an adaptation of Group Task-Related Component Analysis (gTRCA), a novel multivariate signal decomposition method, to automatically extract TEP components that are maximally reproducible across both trials and subjects. Following the validation of a new permutation-based statistical test for gTRCA using simulated data, the method was applied to two independent TMS-EEG datasets, in which stimulation was targeted to the primary motor cortex (M1) in cohorts of 16 and 22 healthy participants. We found that gTRCA reliably identified TEP components that were reproducible at the group level. Notably, the main gTRCA component captured the key spatial, temporal, and spectral features of motor TEPs, remained robust despite reduced number of stimuli and participants, and was consistent across different recordings. These findings demonstrate that gTRCA affords a more reliable characterization of TEPs at the group level, thereby facilitating the translation of TMS-EEG research into clinical practice.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

To address this question, we extract and analyze individual clearance rates from human glymphatic MRI (gMRI) data sets. These clearance rates define subject-specific maps of glymphatic clearance that vary both across cortical lobes and Braak staging regions. We apply these clearance maps as initial states in a computational network model linking misfolded proteins, tissue damage, and local clearance to simulate a series of individual proteinopathy trajectories. Our results show that the spatial heterogeneity in initial clearance induces characteristic propagation patterns, delaying and redirecting the disease progression. Moreover, reducing this spatial heterogeneity accelerates disease progression and induces staging patterns typically associated with AD. A comparison between well-rested subjects and subjects who underwent a single night of sleep deprivation did not reveal differences in initial clearance maps nor in simulated disease progression. These findings suggest that spatial heterogeneity in brain clearance may be a key factor for neurodegenerative resilience.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Senescent brain cells build up in the brains of AD patients and a causal link has been established between senescence and AD-related tauopathy. Methods: To investigate the role of cellular senescence in tau-mediated neuropathology, we crossed the Terc knockout (Terc-/-) senescent mouse model with the P301S tauopathy model (PS19 line). Using brain sections and protein extracts, we employed Western blot and immunostaining analyses to investigate the expression of tau-related neuropathological features within a senescent context. Results: We found that the brains of 6- and 9-month-old Terc-/- mice exhibit significant telomere attrition and signs of cellular senescence. Introducing a senescent phenotype in a tauopathy mouse model resulted in increased tau phosphorylation at key residues, particularly in the hippocampus. Over time, this was associated with enhanced tau truncation and aggregation. These pathological changes were accompanied by exacerbated astrocyte and microglial activation, as well as selective neuronal loss in vulnerable brain regions. Conclusions: Overall, our findings place senescence as a key upstream regulator of tau pathology, suggesting that targeting senescent cells and their detrimental effects may offer promising therapeutic strategies for AD and other related tauopathies.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

While it is often assumed that the remapped touch is encoded in an extrinsic, limb-independent reference frame, an alternative view proposes that touch may instead be represented within an intrinsic, limb-specific coordinate system. To test these hypotheses, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and a novel tactile stimulation paradigm in which participants received touch on their hands positioned at various locations relative to the body. Previous findings suggest that neural activity in primate sensorimotor and parietal regions monotonically encodes limb position. We therefore analyzed amplitude gradients in somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to test predictions from each coding scheme. If touch is coded extrinsically, neural gradients should reflect changes of the external stimulus location, regardless of the limb. If coded intrinsically, gradients should be tied to the position of each limb and mirror each other between hands. Both univariate and multivariate EEG analyses found no evidence for extrinsic coding. Instead, we observed neural signatures of limb-specific, intrinsic spatial codes, the earliest emerging about 160 ms after touch in centro-parietal regions, later shifting to fronto-temporal and parieto-occipital areas. Furthermore, a population-based neural network model of tactile remapping successfully reproduced the observed gradient patterns. These results show that the human brain localizes touch using an intrinsic, limb-specific spatial code, challenging the dominant assumption of extrinsic encoding in tactile remapping.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

We used an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope to deliver stimuli that moved contingent to retinal motion and measured subjects' perceived motion, under conditions with world-fixed background content. We also tested under conditions with background content closer and farther from the stimuli. We found a sharp discontinuity in motion perception.

Methods Muscle biopsies from three JDM patients and three age-matched controls were analysed using the Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler. Regions of interest were selected based on muscle fibres without immune cells, immune cell infiltration and CD68+ macrophage enrichment. Differential gene expression, pathway analysis and pathways clustering analysis were conducted. Key findings were validated in 19 cases of JDM using immunohistochemistry and chemical stains, and a bulk RNAseq dataset of four cases of JDM. Results JDM muscle tissues exhibited significant interferon pathway activation and mitochondrial dysfunction compared to controls. A 15-gene interferon signature was significantly elevated in JDM muscle and macrophage-enriched regions, correlating with clinical weakness. In contrast, mitochondrial dysregulation, characterized by downregulated respiratory chain pathways, was present regardless of interferon activity or muscle strength. The interferon-driven and mitochondrial signatures were replicated in an independent RNAseq dataset from JDM muscle; lack of association between interferon signature and mitochondrial dysregulation was validated in 19 cases by conventional staining methods. Clustering analysis revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles between JDM and control tissues, as well as between JDM patients with varying clinical phenotypes. Conclusions This study highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a consistent pathological feature in JDM muscle, which may be independent of interferon-driven inflammation. These findings highlight the potential for mitochondrial-targeted therapies in JDM management and emphasise the need for further studies to explore their therapeutic value.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

To determine mechanisms that determine long-lasting versus short-term immunity, we examined varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccination as a model system. We contrasted VZV antigen-specific T cells several years after vaccination in adults who had been vaccinated at young (<20 years) or older age (>50 years) with a live-attenuated vaccine that confers durable protection only when given at young age, or with an adjuvanted VZV component vaccine that elicits effective, long-lasting immunity in older adults. CD8+ T cells were highly sensitive to age-related changes showing T cell subset shifts, loss in TCR diversity and reduced stem-like features while gaining NK-like signatures without evidence for cellular senescence or exhaustion. VZV-specific CD4+ T cells were largely resilient to age and maintained phenotypic and TCR diversity. Immunization of older adults with the adjuvanted VZV vaccine did not reverse age-associated defects in CD8+ T cells. Instead, it selectively improved the functionality of VZV-specific Th17 CD4+ T cells and prevented their acquisition of Treg features, likely as consequence of lipid metabolic pathways. Collectively, our data indicate that effective vaccination in older adults is supported by the generation of a durable, antigen-specific CD4+ Th17 population that resists mis-differentiation into Tregs and that compensates for age-related defects in CD8+ T cells.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Equitable sharing of benefits from the commercial use of biological resources is a cornerstone of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). This principle is pivotal in advancing the other two CBD objectives: conserving biological diversity and its sustainable use. India, as a CBD signatory, enacted the Biological Diversity Act in 2002 (amended in 2023) and established a three-tiered implementation system involving the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA), State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs), and Union Territory Biodiversity Councils (UTBCs). A critical regulatory framework within this system is the Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) mechanism, guided by the Nagoya Protocol and NBA guidelines. This study addresses challenges in the identification and processing of biological resources listed as Normally Traded as Commodities (NTC), particularly when discrepancies in scientific nomenclature or taxonomic errors are present. We developed an R package, NTCmatch, designed to facilitate the identification of plant synonyms within the NTC list, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the ABS mechanism. The package was created using devtools and roxygen2, with readxl for data management. Results demonstrate the utility of NTCmatch in synonym matching, although the manual verification of plant parts and sources remains crucial. The package aims to streamline workflows for NBA, SBBs, and UTBCs, ensuring compliance with the Biological Diversity Act and facilitating the equitable sharing of benefits.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a scalable framework for quantifying and mapping multi-species genetic diversity using publicly available DNA sequence data. By calculating nucleotide diversity {pi} across taxa and aggregating values spatially, we define the Genetic Diversity Index (GDI): a site-level metric capturing geographic patterns of intraspecific genetic variation. Using simulations under different scenarios, we assessed the robustness of the GDI and implemented three corrective measures to address sampling bias and the additive effects of species richness. We queried over 25 million accessions from public databases representing 9,409 European vascular plant species and applied this approach to {approx}630,000 georeferenced sequences across 1,860 species. Our results reveal distinct genetic diversity hotspots in the Anatolian Peninsula, Southern Iberia, and Eastern Alps regions corresponding to historical glacial refugia and ecological transition zones. GDI values were largely uncorrelated with species richness or phylogenetic diversity, confirming that the index captures a unique and independent dimension of biodiversity. Our indices performed extremely well and showed that fewer than 1% of studied sites exhibited a significant effect of sampling bias, validating the method's reliability under uneven data coverage. By integrating genetic diversity into spatial biodiversity analyses, the GDI detects large-scale patterns of evolutionary significance. It fills a critical methodological gap, providing a reproducible tool to support conservation prioritization and policy at regional and global scales.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Examples span from the microscopic scale of cells differentiating based on the concentration of a morphogene, to the macroscopic scale of decisions by animals or human beings. The current paradigm in decision theory is based on the assumption that decisions, once taken, cannot be revoked. However, living systems often amend their decisions if accumulated evidence favors an alternative hypothesis. In this paper, we develop a theory for amendable decision making in living systems. We find that, in contrast with irrevocable decisions, optimal amendable decisions can be taken in a finite average time at zero error probability. Our theory successfully predicts the outcome of a visual experiment involving human participants and the accuracy of cell-fate decisions in early development.

This notion applies to all micro- and nanoscale aqueous volumes, each containing a large number of molecules. This allows one to define sets of local conditions, including thermodynamic ones; for instance, a defined temperature requires thermodynamic equilibrium by definition. Once such a condition is fulfilled, one can control local variables and their gradients to theoretically describe the thermodynamic state of living systems at the micro- and nanoscale. Performing ultralocal experimental manipulations has become possible thanks to the patch clamp technique to control the cell membrane potential, as well as fluorescent imaging to monitor molecular concentrations and their intracellular gradients.

These interesting observations closely paralleled ONG41008's ability to inhibit PDACs, and as expected, ONG41008 alone was able to actually ablate engrafted PDACs in nude mice. Interestingly, the anti-PD 1 developed by MSD did not appear to act on immune activation of exhausted Cd8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), but primarily on engrafted PDAC blood vessels. These observations support the latest report from MSD. A549 cells known to be a well appreciated human lung adenocarcinoma cell line were treated with ONG41008.

Statins, commonly used to lower cholesterol, have demonstrated certain selective toxicity towards KRAS-transformed cells, prompting the question of whether statins could achieve selective uptake specifically in KRASMUT cells. To investigate this, we synthesized statin-dye conjugates by attaching a fluorescent dye (Cy5.5) to two statins: simvastatin and pravastatin, aiming to assess whether selective uptake indeed occurs. Our findings revealed that these conjugates exhibited markedly enhanced uptake in KRASMUT cells compared to KRAS wild-type (KRASWT) cells. Given the magnitude of the selective uptake, we realized that the uptake of these conjugates itself is of considerable intrinsic interests. We evaluated the uptake of these conjugates in both KRASMUT and KRASWT cells and examined their potential to selectively target KRASMUT pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) using an engineered PDAC tumor model co-cultured with PCCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Our findings indicate that KRASMUT cancer cells exhibited higher uptake of statin-Cy5.5 conjugates via enhanced macropinocytosis compared to KRASWT cancer cells and CAFs. We also found enhanced uptake of the statin-Cy5.5 conjugate in MCF10A cells with PTEN deficiency, a condition known to elevate macropinocytosis, compared to control MCF10A cells with wild-type PTEN. Notably, in the PCC and CAF co-culture model, the pravastatin-Cy5.5 conjugate selectively killed KRASMUT PCCs without affecting the KRASWT CAFs.

To overcome these challenges and expand the chemical space for TREM2-targeting agents, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to identify novel small molecule TREM2 binders. Using temperature-related intensity change (TRIC) technology in a 384-well plate format (NanoTemper Dianthus), we screened two focused compound libraries comprising over 1,200 molecules. From this screen, 18 preliminary hits (1.44% hit rate) were identified and subsequently validated by dose-response binding studies using microscale thermophoresis (MST), yielding four validated hits (0.32% hit rate) with binding affinities in the high to medium micromolar range (e.g., T2337, KD = 22.4 M). The binding of the top hit, T2337, was further validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Additionally, we assessed the functional activity of all four validated hits in a cellular assay measuring TREM2-mediated Syk phosphorylation in HEK293 cells co-expressing human TREM2 and its adaptor protein DAP12.

We reveal that TGA1 and TGA4 are negative regulators of sulfate uptake, while other TGAs and the nitrate receptors NRT1.1 and NLP7 are not involved in this regulation. Our results show that TGA1 and TGA4 negatively regulate a larger set of genes involved in S signaling and metabolism, not only under nitrate provision, but also under S-deficiency. Under long-term S-deficiency, tga1 tga4 mutant had increased Cys levels in the shoots and showed better fitness. Additionally, TGA1 and TGA4 play a negative role in pathogen-induced indolic GSLs synthesis under sulfate deficiency.

SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) is a MADS-box gene that serves as a key integrator in the flowering pathway. In this study, two full-length SOC1 genes cloned from maize (ZmSOC1) and soybean (GmSOC1), along with a partial SOC1 gene from blueberry (VcSOC1K, containing the K-domain), were individually transformed into tomato for constitutive expression. Phenotypically, the expression of VcSOC1K and ZmSOC1, but not GmSOC1, led to early flowering. Most transgenic lines for all three constructs exhibited a significant increase in fruit number per plant. More importantly, compared to non-transgenic plants, all three constructs resulted in varying degrees of increased fruit production per plant, primarily through enhanced branching. At the transcriptomic level, comparative analysis of GmSOC1 revealed the broader impact of the transformed genes. The increased expression of CLF and EZA1 appears to explain the unchanged flowering time of the GmSOC1 transgenic plants, while the repressed expression of DWARF genes likely contributes to enhanced branching. Additionally, numerous genes associated with biotic and abiotic stress tolerance displayed differential expression.

Implementing state-of-the-art augmentation strategies to boost performance, our convolutional neural network-based model was able to confidently predict ABA responsiveness. We demonstrate that it learned actual motifs in the promoter sequences and confirm that ABRE-binding factor (ABF) binding sites play a key role in regulating ABA-dependent gene expression.

Plants avoid this by germinating only when sufficient water is present. However, the mechanisms by which sufficient water is sensed and how it triggers germination remain unknown. FLOE1 suppresses seed germination under water limitation by undergoing reversible phase changes in response to water potential(2). To understand how FLOE1 affects germination, we compared water behavior in wild type and floe1-1 null mutants. While both had similar amounts of water when dry, floe1-1 seeds hydrated less than the wild type after imbibition. Additionally, bound water was less restricted in floe1-1 embryos, suggesting FLOE1 promotes macromolecular water binding. By developing plant-compatible versions of Genetically Encoded Multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs)(3), we show that FLOE1 increases cytoplasmic viscosity during embryo rehydration. FLOE1 in yeast was sufficient to increase cytoplasmic viscosity.

Recent research underscores the importance of root-exuded coumarins in modulating the root microbiome community structure and facilitating iron uptake. However, interactions between root-associated fungi and coumarins in plant iron nutrition remain unknown. We investigated the mechanism by which a fungal endophyte, Macrophomina phaseolina (F80), enhances Arabidopsis iron nutrition. Fungal-coumarin interactions were assessed by profiling metabolites and measuring iron mobilisation in F80 cultures supplemented with specific coumarins, alongside quantifying growth performance and iron content in Arabidopsis coumarin-biosynthesis mutants inoculated with F80. Our findings reveal that an interaction between the coumarin scopoletin and F80 in the rhizosphere rescues plant growth under iron-limiting conditions by resolving the iron mobility bottleneck. F80 exhibits a capacity to modify scopoletin into iron-chelating catechol coumarin esculetin, thereby releasing available iron. We conclude that Arabidopsis-produced scopoletin functions as a precursor for fungal conversion into iron-chelating coumarins. By extending the role of coumarins from bacterial to fungal members of the root microbiota, this study places coumarins at the centre of commensal-mediated enhancement of plant iron nutrition across microbial kingdoms.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Methods: This study was conducted to investigate whether exogenous polyamine application has the potential to maintain poplar growth and yield under a short duration of salt stress. We analyzed the trends in growth and physiological and biochemical responses of hybrid poplar (Populus nigra x maximowiczii, clone NM6) plants to salt stress by foliar application of putrescine (a diamine). Leaves of young greenhouse-grown plants were sprayed with 1 mM putrescine on several days following one-time application of 100 mM and 200 mM NaCl via roots. For measurement of growth, plant height, stem diameter, and leaf number for each plant were recorded throughout the experiment. Studies on the physiological and biochemical trends included gas exchange, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, soluble sugars and proteins, amino acids, polyamines, and relative water content in leaves. Results: Putrescine spray on the salt-treated plants caused a significant increase in chlorophyll a & b, carotenoids, and soluble proteins on a fresh weight basis. Putrescine application caused a significant increase in fructose, glucose, and galactose in all plants, but putrescine spray had a variable impact on the sucrose content of 100 mM NaCl-treated plants. Based on metabolic responses, plants treated with 100 mM NaCl fared better when sprayed with putrescine than those treated with 200 mM NaCl.

Although conserved, the GBF1-type ARF-GEFs underwent plant-specific evolution. Of the 3 paralogs in Arabidopsis thaliana, AtGNOM-LIKE1 (AtGNL1) performs the GBF1 task of retrograde Golgi-ER traffic whereas AtGNOM mediates polar recycling from endosomes to the basal plasma membrane. AtGNL2 is specific to pollen and is functionally equivalent to AtGNOM. To clarify their evolutionary origin and functional diversification in the plant lineage, we established a phylogenetic tree and ortho-synteny groups (OSGs), which enabled identification of AtGNOM and AtGNL1 orthologs. In addition, somatic paralogs from several species were functionally analysed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants and tested for GNOM-specific DCB-DCB domain interaction in yeast two-hybrid assays. Our results support the following scenario. The ancient plant-specific GBF1-type ARF-GEF was functionally equivalent to AtGNOM and mediated both polar recycling and secretory trafficking. GNL2 only arose in the early flowering plants and then evolved independently. Genome duplication in the basal eudicots, but neither in monocots nor in magnoliids, gave rise to the AtGNL1 ortholog, distinguished by its unique OSG. The AtGNL1 ortholog lost the ability of DCB-DCB interaction and was free to evolve independently, eventually acquiring AtGNL1 function in the rosid clade of core eudicots. In eudicot evolution, the AtGNOM ortholog underwent repeated transposition to different OSGs whereas the AtGNL1 ortholog was recurrently lost but eventually positively selected. This evolutionary process uncoupled polar recycling required for gravitropic response or lateral root initiation from secretory trafficking required for growth.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

While animals use mobile immune cells to eliminate pathogens, plants rely on localized cells in contact with the pathogen to detect and mount immune responses. Although bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has enabled the assessment of plant responses to pathogen infection at the whole transcriptome level, the spatial coordination of plant immune responses remains elusive. In this study, we performed both spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomic experiments to capture the spatial pattern of soybean plant responses to Asian soybean rust infection caused by the pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. Through the analysis of both spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomics data, we identified two distinct host cell states with specific spatial localization in response to pathogen infection: the infected regions with the presence of the pathogen and the surrounding regions bordering the infected regions. Importantly, the surrounding regions exhibited higher expression of defense response-related genes than the infected regions, despite having minimal presence of the pathogen, indicating a cell non-autonomous defense response in the surrounding regions. Additionally, gene co-expression network analysis with single-cell resolution identified a key immune response-related gene module activated in the stressed cells captured in our single-nuclei RNA-seq data. This study reveals the intricate spatial coordination of plant defense responses against pathogen infection and enhances our understanding of the importance of localized cell non-autonomous defense responses in plant-pathogen interactions.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Responses of CO2 assimilation rate (A) to intercellular CO2 partial pressure (Ci) and irradiance (I) link gas exchange measurements to the underlying photosynthetic biochemistry of a leaf. The unique biochemistry and leaf anatomy which distinguish C4 photosynthesis make it necessary to apply models and fitting routines which appropriately parameterise and incorporate these characteristics. Here we provide updates to the C4 photosynthesis model by improving the parameterisation of cyclic electron flow in C4 photosynthesis using experimentally derived values from S. viridis. We additionally describe two fitting routines for assessing C4 photosynthesis based on the updated model. Fitting of a CO2 response curve (A/Ci) provides estimates of maximum PEP carboxylase activity (Vpmax) and maximum Rubisco activity (Vcmax), and calculates the electron transport rate (J) needed to sustain the measured CO2 assimilation rate (A). Fitting of an irradiance response curve (A/I) provides estimates for the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax), day respiration rate (Rd), the quantum yield ({varphi}CO2) and light compensation point ({Gamma}light). Values of the above output parameters are provided at both the measurement temperature and at 25 {degrees}C for ease of comparative reporting.

However, the timing and nature of neuronal changes, differences between neuronal subtypes, and their coordination with glia remain unclear. Here, we used non-negative matrix factorization to identify co-expression gene programs in single-nucleus RNA profiles from the prefrontal cortex of 437 samples from donors whose clinical symptoms ranged between no cognitive impairment and AD dementia. This approach identified early coordinated transcriptional changes across all neuronal subtypes, preceding clinical symptoms of cognitive decline, and validated in independent snRNA-seq, proteomics, and ELISA datasets. We found neurons in AD undergo rapid modulation of synaptic genes, accompanied by convergence of neurons into two distinct programs: An oxidative stress and apoptosis program abundant in vulnerable neuronal subtypes, and a DNA damage and cell-cycle reentry program associated with resilient subtypes. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming was closely tied to glial responses, and diverged between AD to non-AD brain aging, suggesting neuro-glial coordinated reprogramming shapes the AD cascade and influences disease outcomes.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Five deeply diverged chloroplast lineages were revealed that, with the exception of a Eurasian lineage, underwent divergence decoupled from speciation predating modern species lineages by up to 28 ma. The geographic distribution of chloroplast lineages reflects a complex history of genetic admixture during past contact between extinct and modern species including between different subgenera in East Asia and long-term persistence particularly in Japan which is the hotspot of plastome diversity.

Our results confirm the expected pRF size increase across eccentricity and visual areas but found no significant differences in pRF size estimates across MR sequences, voxel sizes, or field strengths. BOLD signal amplitudes were influenced by MR sequence, with the largest signal changes observed for 7TGE, and amplitude increases were noted across cortical depth for GE sequences but not for SE sequences. Contrary to our hypotheses, pRF size estimates were not noticeably affected by the local vascularization, suggesting that pRFs primarily reflect neuronal activity rather than vascular compartment characteristics. Our study highlights the robust nature of pRF size estimates across various fMRI conditions and points toward the decoupling of pRF properties from vascular factors.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Fermentation is under studied in modern and ancient biogeochemistry due to a lack of environmental biomarkers that would constrain its activity. It has long been assumed that fermentation, like respiration, does not express carbon isotope fractionations, precluding isotopic signals as a means of studying it in nature. Here, we tested this idea by growing pure cultures of four fermenting bacteria on glucose and measuring the carbon isotope composition of the organic acids and alcohols produced. We found that fermentation exhibits a strong carbon isotope fractionation, ranging from -6{per thousand} to +16{per thousand}, depending on the fermentation product. This range can even be observed within a single organism. Using bioisotopic models that track site-specific isotope enrichments through metabolic networks, we constrained the enzymes responsible for these fractionations. Our models reproduced in vivo organic acid values in all four organisms. These findings demonstrate that acetate 13C enrichment is likely a consistent signature of fermentation. Furthermore, our study suggests that fermentation imposes an anaerobic trophic carbon isotope fractionation as organic carbon is passed from fermenters to secondary degraders like sulfate reducers. Looking to the geologic past, this trophic fractionation could have imprinted isotopic signals on the three billion year record of sedimentary organic carbon, specifically the inverse {delta}13C pattern of Precambrian acyclic isoprenoid and n-alkane biomarkers. Pervasive evidence of fermentation in the rock record suggests its under-appreciated role in biogeochemical cycles throughout Earth history.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Because variable RBDs of different SARS-CoV-2 strains must bind to the same human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for viral cell entry and infection, we hypothesize that designing a protein with the same or very similar hACE2 binding interface might have a broad-spectrum effect against various SARS-CoV-2 strains. The designed protein binds specifically to the WT-RBD (with micromolar affinity) but not to RBDs from other SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy hotspot analysis revealed that CYN1's broader spectrum capability stems from its engagement of essentially all ACE2 hotspot residues critical for WT-RBD binding, unlike the designed protein. The discovery of CYN1, differing by only four mutations from the designed protein, confirms that targeting the small interface of human viral receptors, rather than the entire receptor, offers a viable strategy for developing broad-spectrum inhibitors.

We show that sex reversal induced by silver thiosulfate (XX masculinization) and ethephon (XY feminization) results in >80% floral sex conversion across genotypes. Despite a shared phenotypic response, transcriptomic analysis of 47 ethylene-related genes (ERGs) revealed a temporally dynamic and sex-specific response: a shared early-phase upregulation of biosynthesis and signaling genes at Day 1, followed by divergent gene expression patterns at Day 14 associated with phenotypic stabilization. Network analysis identified 14 candidate ERGs, including CsMTN, CsACS1, CsACO3, CsACO5 and CsERF1, as key regulators of plasticity. Genomic variant profiling and chromosomal localization further revealed low nucleotide diversity in most ERGs, with several key genes localized exclusively to X chromosome's non-recombinant regions and notably, absent from the Y non-recombinant region. Together, our findings demonstrate that ethylene-mediated sex change in C. sativa involves temporally distinct transcriptional programs that differ between XX and XY plants and affirm that sexual plasticity does not exclusively rely on sex chromosome-linked genes.

To address this, we produced a phylogenetically-informed species prioritisation for the conservation of crayfish and explored the consequences of projected climate change scenarios on crayfish phylogenetic diversity. We used the EDGE2 metric to highlight 70 priority species for conservation. Their combined threatened evolutionary history accounts for 40.7% of the expected phylogenetic diversity loss for all 673 crayfish. Of these priority species, 45.7% are vulnerable to climate change, with the majority (32 species) located in Australia. Under a high warming scenario, individual species that are more evolutionarily distinct are projected to be disproportionately affected. The extinction of climate change vulnerable species could cause the loss of up to 26.3% more phylogenetic diversity than the random expectation, equivalent to 409 million years of evolutionary history. Our results highlight the need to consider climate change effects on phylogenetic diversity to fully understand its impact on biodiversity.

Nevertheless, microbial functions and interactions driving these ecological processes remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyze oral microbiomes from a longitudinal cohort of 24 mother-infant dyads at 1 and 6 months postpartum using shotgun metagenomics. We identify two previously undescribed Streptococcus and Rothia species to be among the most prevalent, abundant and strongly co-occurring members of the oral microbiome of six-month-old infants. To explore the underlying genomic traits enabling this unique lifestyle, we leveraged metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and genome-scale metabolic models (GEMS). Comparative analyses revealed specific genomic and functional characteristics relative to other closely related species and highlighted unique functional features, including genes encoding adhesins and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). The observed co-occurrence patterns were further supported by predicted metabolic interactions within a network of co-occurring oral taxa. Metabolic modeling identified potential exchange of key nutrients, particularly malate and lysine, between these species, suggesting metabolic cross-feeding interactions that may explain their co-occurrence across infant oral microbiomes. Overall, this study provides key insights into the functional adaptations and microbial interactions shaping early colonization in the oral cavity.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Cellular trajectories were derived from the temporal data and probabilistic fate modeling with Waddington-Optimal Transport (WOT). We created transcription factor (TF) centered regulons mapped across the developmental timeline and through network-based prioritization with WOT predicted TFs and in silico TF perturbation, identified key drivers of cell state changes associated with EMT, vascular development, and circadian clock functions. Integration of mouse disease data with human CAD genetic findings identified transition SMC phenotypes that mediate disease risk and point to causal disease mechanisms. Parallel studies using knockout of the validated CAD gene Tcf21 revealed its impact on SMC transition cellular phenotypes and disease risk genes, due in part to a role regulating the transition of SMC precursor cells in the secondary heart field.

I evaluate and compare three four-microphone array geometries -- tetrahedral, planar square, and pyramid, and one with six, the Octahedron configuration -- across a volumetric spatial grid, generating detailed positional and angular error maps. My results demonstrate that the tetrahedral array offers the best balance between positional and angular accuracy, while the octahedral configuration excels in angular precision but with increased positional variability. Planar arrays perform less robustly, especially in angular localisation. My results demonstrate the critical influence of array geometry on localisation robustness and highlight the advantages of three-dimensional microphone arrangements for near- and mid-field echolocation monitoring.

M.", "abstract": "The Progressive Ratio (PR) schedule is a popular test for measuring the motivational value of a reinforcer, in which subjects must exert an increasing amount of work to obtain each successive reward. Despite its popularity, the PR task hinges on a low-dimensional behavioral readout -- breakpoint, or the maximum work requirement subjects are willing to complete before abandoning the task. Here, we show that with a simple modification, the PR task can be transformed into an optimization problem reminiscent of the patch-leaving foraging scenario, which has been analyzed extensively by behavioral ecologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. In the Progressive Ratio with Reset (PRR) task, rats perform the PR task on one lever, but can press a second lever to reset the current ratio requirement back to its lowest value at the cost of enduring a reset delay, during which both levers are retracted. Rats used the reset lever adaptively on the PRR task, and their ratio reset decisions were sensitive to the cost of the reset delay. We derived an approach for computing the optimal bout length -- the number of rewards to earn before pressing the reset lever that produces the greatest long-term rate of reward -- and found that rats flexibly changed their behavior to approximate the optimal strategy. However, rats showed a systematic bias for bout lengths that exceeded the optimal length, an effect reminiscent of \"overharvesting\" in patch-leaving tasks. The PRR task thus represents a novel means of testing whether and how rats adapt their behavior to the cost-benefit structure of the environment in a way that connects deeply to the broader literature on associative learning and optimal foraging theory.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we rigorously evaluate the performance of a recently developed RFID system (iID BEEscience from MicroSensys) in tracking bees under different conditions. We assessed the system's accuracy in detecting and identifying travel direction both in controlled laboratory settings and with free-flying bees. Additionally, we analysed the sources of incorrect or redundant readings and provide a Python script designed to filter out erroneous data, summarising the results in biologically relevant measurements (foraging trip number, trip duration, instances of drifting). Our controlled laboratory tests revealed that the RFID system's accuracy ranged from 93% to 100% in most cases, though accuracy diminished when a large number of transponders passed through the reader simultaneously. We also found certain transponder positions in relation to the reader position to be less reliable. In field conditions, we tracked 33 foraging trips of RFID-tagged honeybees trained to a sucrose solution feeder and observed a 100% success rate in identifying all foraging trips via the RFID data. Given that the transponders weigh only 2.1 mg, we propose that this system is a reliable tool for studying smaller bees (and other insects), which are currently understudied using RFID technology, although its application to species smaller than honeybees (Apis mellifera) requires further testing.

Nonetheless, there is growing interest in developing {beta}-arrestin biased drugs, due to the key regulatory role of {beta}-arrestins in modulating the cellular signaling of most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In cell-based studies of rhodopsin-family GPCRs, mutations in a conserved proline-hydrophobic (ProH) motif within the second intracellular loop (ICL2) have been shown to alter{beta}-arrestin signaling bias. The clinical relevance of such mutations in humans is unknown. However, if naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting this ProH motif exist across the GPCR family, then cross- referencing these genetic variants with large-scale population sequencing and epidemiologic data could reveal potential roles for {beta}-arrestin signaling in human health. In this report, we identify SNPs in human GPCRs that correspond to ProH substitutions, and we show that, in the neurotensin receptor NTSR1, these variants can indeed shift signaling bias. We also estimate a lower-bound population frequency for such SNPs, suggesting that although rare for any given receptor, their cumulative prevalence across the GPCR superfamily may be large enough to impact phenotypic variation. Together with emerging data from biased ligands, our findings support the idea that genetic variations in {beta}-arrestin signaling could represent a meaningful source of therapeutic relevance", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

By combining neural responses across experiments, we obtained high-dimensional population neural response templates that were used to classify unknown samples with a high accuracy.

PRESAGE transforms gene embeddings through an attention-based model to predict perturbation expression outcomes. To assess model performance, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite with novel functional metrics that move beyond traditional regression tasks, including measures of accuracy in effect size prediction, in identifying perturbations with similar expression profiles (phenocopy), and in prediction of perturbations with the strongest impact on specific gene set scores. PRESAGE outperforms existing methods in both classical regression metrics and our novel functional evaluations. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that knowledge source selection is more critical for predictive performance than architectural complexity, with cross-system Perturb-seq data providing particularly strong predictive power. We also find that performance saturates quickly with training set size, suggesting that experimental design strategies might benefit from collecting sparse perturbation data across multiple biological systems rather than exhaustive profiling of individual systems.

Three small proteins were considered. An unknotted one featuring a beta-sandwhich fold (FN3), a protein embedding a shallow trefoil knot (MJ0366), and a deeply knotted trefoil protein (YibK). Results from Monte Carlo simulations of a native-centric Calpha model show that thermal stability increases througout evolution for all considered proteins suggesting it provided a selective pressure for the introduction of biosynthetic amino acids in the alphabet repertoire. Additionally, the thermodynamic cooperativity, the two-state nature of the folding transition, and the kinetic efficiency of folding (and knotting) displayed by the unknotted (and shallow knotted) protein have been roughly conserved throughout evolution, indicating that early alphabets, and, in particular the anscestral one composed of 10 amino acids, is competent to self-assemble relatively complex native structures. However, while the ancestral alphabet is clearly more efficient in collapsing the polypetpide chain to non-specific (i.e. non-native) knots, it significantly compromises the thermodynamic cooperativity and the folding ability of the deeply knotted protein YibK. The findings presented here collectively suggest that the alphabet of amino acids evolved to improve folding, but early alphabets might not have favoured the folding of native structures with deep knots.

Whether lactate is a major fuel in cancer cells remains debated. This study investigated whether lactate could serve as a metabolic fuel in glioma cells and replace glucose to support viability. Methods: A bioluminescence ATP assay and calcein-AM/EthD-III double-staining were used to measure ATP content and viability in mouse (VM-M3, CT-2A) and human (U-87MG) glioma cells differing in cell biology and genetic background. Viability was assessed in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TPMs) from VM/Dk and C57BL/6J mice, used as syngeneic non-neoplastic controls for VM-M3 and CT-2A gliomas, respectively. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was determined using the Resipher system. Results: Lactate alone failed to sustain ATP content and viability in all glioma cell lines. ATP content and viability were lower in cancer cells cultured in glutamine and lactate than in glucose and glutamine. In contrast, lactate alone sustained over 45% viability in both TPM models. Moreover, viability was similar between TPMs cultured in glutamine and lactate and in glucose and glutamine. In human U-87MG, lactate addition under severe glucose restriction increased OCR and viability. A low dose of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose abolished both increases. Conclusions: Our results suggest non-neoplastic mouse TPMs utilize lactate more effectively than mouse glioma cells. In U-87MG, lactate utilization appears glycolysis-dependent, given its sensitivity to 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In conclusion, our data does not support lactate as a major oxidative fuel for viability in mouse and human glioma cells.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Importantly, rice plants are frequently cultivated in waterlogged soils that are highly reductive and prone to Fe3+ reduction to the more soluble Fe2+, which can accumulate and cause Fe toxicity. Little is known about which genes control Fe excess detoxification. OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 transport Fe into the vacuole, and OsVIT2 is induced under Fe excess, but whether they play a role in Fe detoxification was not demonstrated. We generated double mutants osvit1osvit2 using CRISPR-Cas9 to test whether loss of function of both genes could increase Fe concentration in seeds, and to test whether their loss of function has impact in rice Fe excess tolerance. We showed that osvit1osvit2 double mutants accumulated more Fe in brown rice. Fe accumulation was clear in embryo scutellum and plumule, suggesting VIT transporters have a role in determining Fe spatial distribution. We also showed that root uptake contributed significantly for increased Fe accumulation in osvit1osvit2 seeds, suggesting OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 are involved in sequestering Fe in vegetative tissues and decreasing translocation. Strikingly, we found that osvit1osvit2 plants were more sensitive to Fe excess, revealing a trade-off between Fe biofortification and Fe excess tolerance. Our data indicates OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 are key for Fe excess detoxification, which should be considered in their use as targets for biofortification.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in nanomaterials have offered novel molecular delivery platforms, but challenges such as toxicity, complexity, and labor-intensive processes persist. To address these issues, we developed a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based microneedle (MN) delivery system that can be precisely applied to various plant tissues (e.g., leaves or stems), which demonstrates high delivery efficiency compared to the conventional methods while reducing application dose by 90-99%. This MN system facilitates delivery of diverse small molecules ranging from fluorescent dyes, growth promoters, to antiviral agents into plant tissues. By applying fluorescent dye-loaded MNs onto tomato stems, we demonstrated effective molecular diffusion through vascular tissues. Additionally, MNs loaded with gibberellic acid (GA3) enhanced stem and branch growth in tomatoes and restored the lateral flowering phenotype in Arabidopsis ft-10 mutants, with significant upregulation of GA receptor gene expression. Lastly, salicylic acid (SA) injections with MNs induced resistance to Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) in Nicotiana Benthamiana, comparable to conventional spray-based approaches. This easily fabricated and cost-effective PVA-MN system provides a promising tool for precision agriculture, enhancing plant health and productivity while addressing the limitations of conventional delivery methods.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Major groups of volatile organic compounds that contribute to strawberry aroma include terpenes, fatty acid esters, furanones, and benzenoids. Understanding the biosynthetic genes and pathways underlying strawberry terpene metabolism provides resources for developing precision breeding strategies to improve strawberry aroma traits. Here we describe the genome-wide identification and functional analysis of the terpene synthase (TPS) family that governs terpene chemical diversity in strawberries. Mining of the allo-octoploid genome of the cultivar Royal Royce identified 75 TPS gene candidates. Biochemical characterization of 27 predicted mono-, sesqui- and di-TPS enzymes via in vitro activity assays and in vivo enzyme co-expression studies demonstrated a range of TPS activities that are relevant for the biosynthesis of two thirds of known strawberry terpenes as well as products not previously described in octoploid strawberry. Complementary metabolomic and transcriptomic studies across a diversity panel of strawberry accessions demonstrated substantial variation in the composition and abundance of more than 30 detected accession-specific and common terpene aromas, nine of which matching characterized TPS products. Analysis of a developmental time series of two accessions with contrasting aroma further revealed accession-specific alterations of terpene metabolism during fruit ripening. These results expand our understanding of strawberry aroma metabolism and characterized terpene aroma genes as a resource for the molecular breeding of desirable aroma traits.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Nest building is involved in thermoregulation, positive motivational states, and motor function, and has been proposed as an index for ethanol withdrawal severity in mice. However, nest building outcomes after voluntary ethanol consumption have not been examined. Here, we tested male and female C57BL/6J mice on a 4-day drinking in the dark (DID) paradigm of binge-like drinking with either ethanol or a water control and analyzed nest scores at two time points (48 hours and 7 days) after the last DID session. At 48 hours after the last DID session, there were no differences between the two groups in nest quality. At 7 days after DID, ethanol-drinking animals showed significantly lower nest scores than the water group. No differences were found between the ethanol- and water-drinking groups in locomotor activity or anxiety-like behavior at this timepoint, indicating that nest building deficits in the ethanol group were likely not due to underlying differences in these behaviors.

Although it is well established that individuals conceptualize emotions using a low-dimensional space organized by valence and arousal, the neural mechanisms giving rise to this configuration remain unclear. Here, we examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal circuits - regions implicated in forming cognitive maps - also support the abstraction of emotional experiences. Using functional MRI data collected as participants viewed emotionally evocative film clips, we found that activity in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex predicted self-reported emotion across schematically distinct videos, consistent with a role in structural learning. Computational modeling of emotion transitions revealed that hippocampal responses to films and emotion self-reports could be predicted based on the statistical regularities of emotion transitions across different temporal scales. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal-prefrontal systems represent emotion concepts at multiple levels of abstraction, offering new insight into how the brain organizes emotion knowledge.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

The CP regulates circadian rhythms, but links between CP circadian genes and migraine are unexplored. Objective: This study examined CP circadian gene transcriptome changes in a chronic migraine rat model versus controls to identify migraine-related pathways. Design: Chronic migraine model: Sprague Dawley rats (3 females, 3 males) received nitroglycerine (NTG) every other day for 9 days; controls (3 females, 3 males) got saline. CP from the 4th ventricle was collected 2 hours post-final injection for RNAseq. Methods: Migraine Behavior: Von Frey hair tests on days 1, 5, and 9, pre- and 2 hours post-NTG/saline injection, assessed basal and NTG-induced pain thresholds. RNAseq & Analysis: Differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05, fold change > 1) were identified. GO, KEGG, and Reactome enrichment analyses evaluated circadian gene expression changes. Results: NTG group showed reduced basal and NTG-induced pain thresholds on days 1, 5, and 9. Females had more upregulated genes (MT2A, SLC7A11), males upregulated ZBTB16, S100A8. SLC7A11, SCG2, GRIA1 showed inverse regulation (up in females, down in males). Circadian gene expression altered: 10 genes upregulated (e.g., SERPINE1, MAPK9, ATF4), 13 downregulated (e.g., PER2, DBP, EZH2). Sex-specific differences: females (FBXL12, GPR157), males (NKX2-1, ATF4, CLOCK). GO/KEGG analyses revealed significant enrichment of circadian rhythm-related pathways, insulin resistance, and inflammatory response processes, with sex-specific differences: females showed HIF-1 signaling and hemoglobin-related pathways, while males exhibited arachidonic acid and leukotriene production. Conclusion: CP transcriptomics in the rat migraine model revealed sex-specific gene regulation, with females upregulating antioxidant genes (MT2A, SLC7A11) and males upregulating inflammatory factors (ZBTB16, S100A8), alongside circadian disruption (e.g., SERPINE1 upregulated, PER2 downregulated). Pathway analyses indicate enriched circadian rhythms, HIF-1 signaling (females), inflammatory processes (males), lipid metabolism (PPAR), and heme signaling, highlighting sex-specific and circadian targets for migraine therapy.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we tested the effect of transgenic overexpression of LCMT-1 or PME-1 on cognitive and electrophysiological impairments caused by exposure to either recombinant oligomeric human tau or oligomeric tau prepared from mice subjected to blast-induced traumatic brain injury. We found that overexpression of LCMT-1 reduced sensitivity to tau-induced impairments, while overexpression of PME-1 increased sensitivity to these impairments.

This hypothesis seems at odds with evidence from large-scale neuronal recordings in mice showing that neuronal population activity is high-dimensional. To demonstrate that low-dimensional latent dynamics and high-dimensional activity can be two sides of the same coin, we present an analytically solvable recurrent neural network (RNN) model whose dynamics can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional dynamical system, but generates an activity manifold that has a high linear embedding dimension. This raises the question: Do low-dimensional latents explain the high-dimensional activity observed in mouse visual cortex? Spectral theory tells us that the covariance eigenspectrum alone does not allow us to recover the dimensionality of the latents, which can be low or high, when neurons are nonlinear. To address this indeterminacy, we develop Neural Cross-Encoder (NCE), an interpretable, nonlinear latent variable modeling method for neuronal recordings, and find that high-dimensional neuronal responses to drifting gratings and spontaneous activity in visual cortex can be reduced to low-dimensional latents, while the responses to natural images cannot. We conclude that the high-dimensional activity measured in certain conditions, such as in the absence of a stimulus, is explained by low-dimensional latents that are nonlinearly processed by individual neurons.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Our investigations revealed a reliable sensory response to stimulation of the lower incisor or lip within this ganglion. The responsive neurons were confined to a specific portion of the trigeminal ganglion, consistent with innervation of the lower oral cavity by the mandibular nerve (V3). Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe a discernible map differentiating the lower tooth and the lip. Instead, the spatial representation of the tooth and lip within this portion of trigeminal ganglion exhibited intermingling with no clear border between tooth-responding and lip-responding neurons.

Patients with SCN2A loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, such as protein-truncating mutations, often experience later-onset and drug-resistant epilepsy, highlighting an urgent unmet clinical need for new therapies. We previously developed a gene-trap Scn2a (Scn2agt/gt) mouse model with a global NaV1.2 reduction in the widely used C57BL/6N (B6) strain. Although these mice display multiple behavioral abnormalities, EEG recordings indicated only mild epileptiform discharges, possibly attributable to the seizure-resistant characteristics associated with the B6 strain. To enhance the epileptic phenotype, we derived congenic Scn2agt/gt mice in the seizure-susceptible DBA/2J (D2J) strain. Notably, we found that these mice exhibit prominent spontaneous absence seizures, marked by both short and long spike-wave discharges (SWDs). Restoring NaV1.2 expression in adult mice substantially reduced their SWDs, suggesting the possibility of SCN2A gene replacement therapy during adulthood. RNA sequencing revealed significant alterations in gene expression in the Scn2agt/gt mice, in particular a broad downregulation of voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) genes, including KV1.1. The reduction of KV1.1 expression was further validated in human cerebral organoids with SCN2A deficiency, highlighting KV1.1 as a promising therapeutic target for refractory seizures associated with SCN2A dysfunction.

Sox2-expressing cells are localized in the anterior parenchyma, marginal zone, and posterior pituitary, regardless of mouse age. Gonadotrophs are localized in the anterior parenchyma distinct from Sox2-expressing cells. During the juvenile and prepubertal periods, cells in transition from Sox2 expression to the tdTomato expression, as well as numerous differentiated gonadotrophs, were also present in the marginal zone.

Testing theories about the evolution of reproductive modes first requires knowing whether sex is present or absent in a population. While this seems straightforward, the literature on asexuality reflects a history of shifting claims and uncertainty regarding reproductive mode, especially where sex is potentially rare or cryptic. Here, we develop a new framework to explore the challenges in detecting and quantifying sexual reproduction from population genomic data, based on genetic simulations. We first show that commonly calculated population genetic statistics do not reliably distinguish sexual and obligate asexual scenarios if asexuality is accompanied by sex-independent homologous recombination, as emerging evidence suggests is often the case. We then present a new method to quantify the relationship between evolutionary trees and mode of reproduction by exhaustively classifying local trees for pairs of diploid individuals using ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs). This approach accurately distinguishes signatures of genetic exchange and homologous recombination, although uncertainty remains due to unavoidable biases in the steps needed to reconstruct trees from genome data. We introduce a new statistic and simulation models to account for common reconstruction biases. Our approach offers the potential for improved quantitative inference of reproductive modes that is extendable and applicable to a broad range of eukaryotes.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Comparative analyses revealed distinct species and genus specific genomic characteristics. Additionally, we used the graph pangenome to illustrate locus-level exploration by examining the Pun1 locus associated with capsaicinoid biosynthesis, identifying multiple Pun1-like genes including their genomic position and homology information. The integration of these new resources into a dynamic Capsicum pangenome framework provides a versatile platform for extracting genetic information relevant to both fundamental research and breeding applications.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

S.; Hill, K. A.; Kari, L.", "abstract": "Extreme environments impose strong mutation and selection pressures that drive distinctive, yet understudied, genomic adaptations in extremophiles. In this study, we identify 15 bacterium-archaeon pairs that exhibit highly similar k-mer-based genomic signatures despite maximal taxonomic divergence, suggesting that shared environmental conditions can produce convergent, genome-wide patterns that transcend evolutionary distance. To uncover these patterns, we developed a computational pipeline to select a composite genome proxy assembled from non-contiguous subsequences of the genome. Using supervised machine learning on a curated dataset of 693 extremophile microbial genomes, we found that 6-mers and 100 kbp genome proxy lengths provide the best balance between classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results provide conclusive evidence of the pervasive nature of k-mer-based patterns across the genome, and uncover the presence of taxonomic and environmental components that persist across all regions of the genome. The 15 bacterium-archaeon pairs identified by our method as having similar genomic signatures were validated through multiple independent analyses, including 3-mer frequency profile comparisons, phenotypic trait similarity, and geographic co-occurrence data. These complementary validations confirmed that extreme environmental pressures can override traditionally recognized taxonomic components at the whole-genome level. Together, these findings reveal that adaptation to extreme conditions can carry robust, taxonomic domain-spanning imprints on microbial genomes, offering new insight into the relationship between environmental mutagenesis and selection and genome-wide evolutionary convergence.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Training logistic regression models on increasingly large, publicly available single-cell datasets opens up opportunities to build accurate and robust cell type prediction models but poses major computational challenges. Here, we adapt and extend the theory of coresets for logistic regression. In particular, we compute a previously introduced classification complexity measure using linear programming to identify single-cell datasets which admit coresets, i.e. random samples of cells, that preserve logistic loss. We show that applying this complexity measure requires a prior dimensionality reduction by, e.g., principle component analysis, and prove that logistic loss is preserved under this linear transformation. In experiments on several cell atlases, we compared our method to CellTypist, a logistic regression-based immune cell atlas and scMulan, a pre-trained language model, to demonstrate that theoretical guarantees translate to an accurate cell type label transfer method that scales to atlas-scale datasets.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Although certain bacterial and fungal strains can colonize epoxy polymers, enzymes capable of efficiently degrading these materials have not yet been reported. Consequently, there is an urgent need for an effective, sustainable, and biologically inspired solution for CFRP recycling. Here, a chemo-enzymatic two-step oxidation process was developed. A chemical pre-treatment with propionic acid and hydrogen peroxide was used to recover imbedded carbon fibers. Additionally, three novel bacterial laccases isolated from the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) demonstrated the ability to degrade three epoxy resin scaffolds from Hexflow(R) RTM6, used in aircraft applications. The sequential combination of both oxidative steps enabled the retrieval of clean carbon fibers and partial modification of epoxy functional groups, with the release of defined products over time. This bio-inspired approach renders the process more environmentally friendly and marks an initial step toward developing a bio-based recycling method for epoxy CFRPs.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Rye is associated with several health benefits, which is attributed to its comparatively higher fiber content (primarily fructans and arabinoxylans) that promote production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) by gut microbiota, in particular butyrate. Intervention studies revealed bacterial alterations upon rye administration, however, the detailed mechanisms involved in its degradation are not understood. We grew fecal communities (n=20) on pre-digested rye and wheat, respectively, demonstrating that rye was yielding higher cell and SCFA concentrations in almost all samples along with distinct abundances of many taxa. A multi metaOmics (metagenomics/metatranscriptomics) approach (n=5 donors) showed higher bacterial growth rates for most taxa on rye compared to wheat. The higher growth rate of rye was accompanied by increased expression of genes involved in growth and energy generation suggesting higher carbon substrate accessibility. The carbohydrate active enzyme repertoire was greatly distinct between communities growing on the two substrates with several specific glycoside hydrolases increasingly expressed in rye containing cultures. Agathobacter faecis was revealed as the key butyrogenic species for rye degradation and its expression pattern based on metagenome assembled genomes showed adaptation to growth on rye via expression of genes involved in arabinoxylan degradation and fructose (major monomer of fructans) uptake. Our study verifies higher SCFA production from rye over wheat and gives detailed insights into molecular mechanisms involved. It supports that the observed health benefits of rye are mediated by gut microbiota.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Some antibiotics have the potential to mediate interference competition by triggering a bacterial stress response that subsequently activates endogenous viruses integrated in bacterial genomes (prophages). Canonically, this activation is regulated by the SOS response upon DNA damage. Here we show that a metabolite produced by natural isolates of Vibrio ordalii circumvents the SOS response by directly triggering prophage induction in other Vibrio species, co-occurring in the same environment. While the metabolite was previously classified as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, we observe how it acts as a peptide deformylase inhibitor that specifically induces certain prophages, even when target bacterial cells carry multiple other prophages. Its biosynthetic gene cluster, or ord cluster, also encodes its own peptide deformylase (OrdE) which provides self-immunity to producer strains. Likewise, among natural Vibrio isolates that carry similar prophages, resistance against the ord metabolite was found in those that had acquired a divergent second peptide deformylase. Finally, we show that prophage induction by the ord cluster prevents slower-growing producer strains from being outcompeted by their otherwise fast-growing competitors if they carry an inducible prophage. Thus, we demonstrate how natural products play additional impactful roles in communities beyond antibiotic activity and that prophage induction serves as an interference competition strategy, sustaining community diversity.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Its well-established synergy with influenza A virus (IAV) often results in secondary bacterial pneumonia, a condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. As pneumococcal pneumonia is invariably preceded by nasopharyngeal colonization, preventing colonization represents a promising intervention strategy. Current approaches, including pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and antibiotics, can drive serotype replacement and antimicrobial resistance, underscoring the need for novel, targeted, and serotype-independent alternatives. We previously identified seven commensal streptococcal strains (S. oralis A22 and S. mitis B22-G22) that robustly inhibit S. pneumoniae growth and biofilm formation in vitro. Here, using a murine model, we demonstrate that colonization with the commensal strain F22Ad significantly reduces pneumococcal density in the nasopharynx by day 10 post-infection and prevents pneumococcal dissemination to the lungs following IAV co-infection. This protective effect was dependent on bacteriocins encoded at the blp1 locus. Among these, Bac2v1 (alone or in combination with Bac1) significantly reduced pneumococcal colonization. Notably, Bac2v1 exerted serotype-independent inhibitory activity, impairing the growth of diverse pneumococcal strains. Our findings provide the first in vivo proof-of-concept that commensal streptococci, and specifically their bacteriocins, can disrupt S. pneumoniae colonization and prevent progression to secondary bacterial pneumonia.

The electron conduit consists of two c-type cytochromes on either site of the outer membrane and a {beta}-barrel protein in the middle that seems to facilitate interaction of the two heme containing proteins. This study reveals that the periplasmic c-type cytochrome MtrA is not only part of the electron conduit, but also assists in the periplasmic transport of the unfolded outer membrane protein MtrB, a function that was so far believed to be conducted for all outer membrane {beta}-barrel proteins by one of the canonical chaperones SurA, Skp or DegP.

Yet, despite their conserved function, many bacteria encode multiple PDFs, a genomic feature whose prevalence and implications remain largely unexplored. Here, we reveal that nearly half of all bacterial genomes carry more than one PDF gene, frequently embedded within mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and integrons. In Vibrio cholerae, the accessory PDF (Def2VCH) confers reduced susceptibility to actinonin (ACT), the most studied PDF inhibitor, while still supporting bacterial growth in absence of the canonical PDF copies (Def1VCH). Crystallographic analysis shows that this reduced susceptibility stems from an arginine-to-tyrosine substitution that probably reduces ACT binding. Strikingly, this resistance signature is shared by integron-encoded PDFs, and transfer of an integron-encoded PDF cassette from Pseudoxanthomonas into a susceptible V. cholerae is sufficient to abolish ACT susceptibility. These findings expose a cryptic reservoir of resistance within the bacterial mobilome and highlight a challenge to the therapeutic potential of PDF-targeting antibiotics: resistance may not only emerge, but is already encoded, mobile, and ready to spread.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

While CD4 downregulation by HIV-1 Nef and Vpu proteins has been extensively studied, the contribution of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) in this mechanism is less understood. While Env is known to retain CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through its CD4-binding site (CD4bs), little is known about the mechanisms underlying this process. Here we show that the cytoplasmic tail of Env is a major determinant in CD4 downregulation. This function is highly conserved as it was observed with nine different infectious molecular clones from four clades. The small but significant accumulation of CD4 at the surface of cells infected with Env cytoplasmic tail deleted viruses is sufficient to trigger Env to adopt a more open conformation. This prompted recognition of such HIV-1-infected cells by plasma from people living with HIV (PLWH) and several families of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies, leading to the elimination of these cells by ADCC. While cytoplasmic tail truncations are known to enhance Env expression at the cell surface, this did not fully explain the increased recognition of infected cells by CD4i antibodies and plasma from PLWH. Introduction of the CD4bs D368R mutation, which abrogates CD4 interaction, decreased Env recognition and ADCC. Overall, our results show that CD4 downregulation by the cytoplasmic tail of Env contributes to the protection of infected cells from ADCC.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Plasma IL-18 levels are elevated in Jak2VF CH. Genetic deficiency of IL-18 has been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in non-CH murine models. However, whether IL-18 inhibition promotes atherosclerosis in control or Jak2VF CH is unknown. Approach and Results: Ldlr-/- mice were transplanted with bone marrow (BM) from Mx1-cre Jak2VF (20%) and wild-type (80%) mice or with control BM, fed a Western-type diet (WTD) for 8, 10 or 16 weeks and administered control or IL-18 IgG from 4 weeks onwards. IL-18 antibody treatment increased plaque collagen content and cap thickness. Unexpectedly, IL-18 antibody treatment increased the size of early lesions and promoted formation of advanced lesions with large necrotic cores in Jak2VF CH mice. IL-18 antibody treatment was associated with diminished interferon (IFN)-{gamma} and AIM2 levels and reduced macrophage pyroptosis especially in Jak2VF CH mice. However, IL-18 antibodies increased cleaved Caspase-3 and TUNEL+ macrophages (indicating increased apoptosis) and reduced efferocytosis. Sc-RNA-seq analysis showed that IL-18 antibody treatment reduced expression of MHC class II genes, a marker of IFN-{gamma} signaling, and of genes mediating efferocytosis (Mertk and Axl), in resident-like macrophage subpopulations in Jak2VF CH mice. Consistently, IFN-{gamma} injection increased Axl and Mertk expression in resident peritoneal macrophages. Conclusion: Despite improvements in collagen and fibrous cap thickness in Jak2VF CH mice, IL-18 antibody treatment increased advanced necrotic lesions, reflecting a shift from pyroptotic to apoptotic cell death coupled with defective efferocytosis, events which were coordinated by reduced IFN-{gamma} signaling. These findings indicate a mixed atherosclerosis phenotype resulting from IL-18 inhibition, advocating for alternative therapeutic strategies.

In Escherichia coli, the initiator protein DnaA constructs a higher-order initiation complex at the origin oriC which locally unwinds the DNA, and recruits DnaB helicase-DnaC loader complexes to the unwound region. We previously demonstrated that the two DnaA subcomplexes formed on oriC bind a specific DNA strand of the unwound origin, and tether individual DnaB-DnaC complexes via stable interactions between DnaA domain I and DnaB. A low-affinity DnaA-DnaB interaction mediated by DnaA domain III His136 is essential for DnaB-dependent origin unwinding. Here, we identified DnaB Thr86 as the critical residue mediating this low-affinity interaction. Structural modelling suggests that Thr86 is surface-exposed near the DNA entry site of DnaB. Functional analyses revealed that DnaB Thr86 was specifically required for DnaB loading onto the DnaA-bound strand of the unwound oriC. Furthermore, this strand-specific DnaB loading was required for enabling translocation of the opposing DnaB helicase loaded on the DnaA-free strand.

Contrary to our expectations, all accessions showed unstable meiosis: the average tetravalent frequency per meiosis per plant ranged from 4.8 to 6.4 per line, and these tetravalent associations also persisted from diakinesis to metaphase I. Using chromosome-specific fluorescence in situ hybridisation probes, we found that most chromosomes showed similar frequencies of tetravalent formation except for chromosomes A03 and A06, which predominantly formed tetravalents (>90%).

M.; Hu, H.; Li, R.; Uribe-Salazar, J. M.; Dennis, M. Y.; Quon, G.", "abstract": "Identifying organism-level phenotypic variation that arises from genetic variation is a longstanding problem in genetics. Model organisms such as zebrafish are frequently used for genotype to phenotype studies as they can be genetically manipulated, grown and phenotyped for morphological changes in a high throughput manner through automated systems and imaging. However, individuals from model organisms are typically grown in groups: clutches for zebrafish and frogs, and litter for rodents. These clutches act as strong confounders during image analysis, as individuals from different genotypes but grown in the same clutch tend to look more similar to each other than to individuals with the same genotype in other clutches. Existing approaches such as conditional image classification models and domain adaptation approaches perform poorly on addressing these technical batch effects. Here, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model (cLDM) that disentangles these technical batch effects from morphological features by explicitly conditioning on batch-specific variables during generation, enabling targeted separation of technical artifacts from biologically relevant data. This approach enables accurate classification of genotypes using morphological images of individual zebrafish from distinct mutant classes. Furthermore, this approach allows us to efficiently correct for batch effect and demonstrates the versatility of cLDM in tackling domain-specific problems. This work highlights the potential of cLDM to overcome batch effects and extract meaningful features.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

While there have been thousands of host-pathogen PPIs determined to date, the lack of structural information for these impedes the study of the prevalence of molecular mimicry and convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. To address this, we benchmarked AlphaFold2 and 3 for prediction of structures of host-pathogen interactions observing that accurate models can be retrieved when ranking by modelling confidence, despite an overall low performance. We predicted structures for 6,782 pathogen-human PPIs yielding 803 models of higher confidence. Most pathogen proteins interacting with a common human protein are predicted to do so via the same interface, suggesting a high degree of convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. When comparing structural models from host-pathogen and host-host interactions, we observe that a majority of pathogen proteins are predicted to target existing human PPI interfaces. We categorized instances of mimicry into different modes, occurring at different frequencies: 1) via the same domain family (least common); 2) via a similar structural motif; and 3) via a similar linear motif (most common). We selected examples of linear motif interactions for binding assay testing, confirming 8 out of 12 predicted interfaces, including 3 viral linear motif interactions. This validates AlphaFold's ability to model some host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry. This work showcases the value of large-scale structural modelling to study convergent evolution of host-pathogen interactions and how molecular mimicry may contribute to infection or host defense.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

A key acid resistance mechanism of the facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella is expression of the arginine decarboxylase AdiA. While AdiA confers acid resistance via an H+-consuming reaction, we discover that the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of adiA mRNA is processed by RNase E into a regulatory small RNA, AdiZ. Through RNA-RNA interactome profiling and transcriptomic analysis, followed by in vitro structural probing and in vivo validations, we demonstrate that AdiZ directly base-pairs with and negatively regulates ptsG, pykF, and dmsA mRNAs involved in glucose uptake, glycolysis, and anaerobic respiration, respectively. Intriguingly, AdiZ is induced and facilitates Salmonella survival within macrophages, where acidic and hypoxic stresses prevail. Thus, simultaneous expression of AdiA and AdiZ from a single mRNA ties arginine-dependent acid resistance to metabolic reprogramming of Salmonella in the host intracellular niches.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

This process is challenged by the gradual degradation of the viral content of the wastewater over time. Testing protocols are complex and often cannot be performed on site, resulting in delays between collection and testing. The evidence of continued degradation of viral RNA when stored at low temperatures is currently limited to a small number of studies with mixed results. Taking advantage of variable delays between sample collection and processing, we used a Bayesian temporal model and data from two winter periods of a national surveillance program in Switzerland to determine the rate at which the measured viral concentrations of four respiratory viruses declined as a result of RNA degradation between sample collection and processing. We found evidence of substantial degradation between the collection and processing of samples with daily rates of up to -0.28 (-0.38 - -0.19 95\\% CrI). We established that reduction in viral concentrations resulting from post-sampling degradation was responsible for a number of measurements falling below quantifiable limits. For one treatment plant, we estimate that 39 measurements fell below the limit of detection due to RNA degradation over the course of a single season. Measurements are more likely to be lost early in the seasonal epidemic when concentrations are still low. This delays consistent reliable measurement and sets back epidemiological assessments relevant to public health management strategies.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

While codon optimization techniques employed by contemporary sequence providers promise high-expression products, expression levels are often unsatisfactory. Whether the causes for this performance unreliability are due to fundamental constraints on the predictability of protein yields, or whether they stem from differences in theoretical approaches, is unknown. Here, we performed a comparative analysis to address this question. We assessed the performance of twelve different optimization approaches at enhancing expression of a sequence encoding a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. Six approaches stemmed from commercial providers and six from freely available sources. Through analysis of their elongation time profiles and multidimensional scaling we assessed which algorithms follow a unique optimization approach. We found that codon-optimized sequences are, on average, capable to raise protein expression levels with respect to the nonoptimised source sequence. However, variation in the protein expression levels was large. Simple, non-proprietary optimization techniques were capable of achieving protein expression levels that fall within the top expression range amongst candidate sequences. Lastly, we found that negative epistasis influences sequence protein expression levels. Since therefore the protein expression landscape arising from synonymous sequence space must exhibit a non-negligible degree of ruggedness, standard approaches will be limited in their capacity to predict protein expression levels of sequences.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

P. leporinus vectors two bacterial pathogens, the {gamma}-proteobacterium Candidatus Arsenophonus phytopathogenicus (CAP) and the stolbur phytoplasma Candidatus Phytoplasma solani (CPS), which are responsible for a range of disease syndromes, including syndrome basses richesses (SBR) in sugar beet. We used long-read metagenomic sequencing to characterize the genomes of microbes associated with P. leporinus, resulting in the complete sequences of CAP and CPS, as well as primary symbionts of the genera Purcelliella, Sulcia and Vidania, and facultative symbionts Rickettsia and Wolbachia. The primary symbionts are inferred to provide all ten essential amino acids and contribute to B vitamin biosynthesis. The genomes of CPS and CAP encode numerous pathogenicity factors, enabling the colonization of different hosts. Bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the tissue distribution, cellular localization, relative abundance and transmission patterns of these bacteria. The intracellular presence of all primary symbionts in bacteriomes, the intracellular presence of Wolbachia, and the intranuclear localization of Rickettsia, suggest vertical transmission. CPS was restricted to salivary glands, suggesting strict horizontal, plant-mediated transmission, whereas CAP colonized all tissue types, allowing for horizontal and vertical transmission.

The Southern Ocean is among the regions where these impacts are particularly pronounced. Phytoplankton, which perform the bulk of primary production, both maintain the Antarctic marine food web and contribute to the role of the Southern Ocean as the largest oceanic sink for atmospheric CO2. Previous observational and modeling studies have revealed certain drivers-phytoplankton relationships and highlighted the important confounding factors. In this study, we quantified how climate and environmental drivers interact and influence phytoplankton biomass over a 20-year period, across the entire Southern Ocean, within a multi-factor framework. Specifically, we examined the relationships among atmospheric CO2, surface water pH, sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, dissolved iron concentration, and chlorophyll a concentration. To perform this analysis, we introduced and applied two novel methodological approaches. Firstly, to address seasonal autocorrelation, we combined seasonal trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) with piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM). This approach allowed for robust estimation of long-term driver magnitudes and causal pathways, even in the presence of limited sample sizes and complex data structures. Secondly, given the highly interconnected nature of environmental drivers, we employed a data-driven SEM approach to objectively identify causal structures and avoid biases associated with a priori pathway selection. Our results show a clear signal of ocean acidification driven by increasing CO2, iron limitation of phytoplankton biomass during spring, and seasonal differences in both the magnitude and structure of the causal pathways, demonstrating the dynamic nature of seasonal processes in the Southern Ocean. This study presents the first Southern Ocean-wide, multi-factor assessment of climate and environmental impacts on phytoplankton biomass over a two-decade period.

While the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway is the predominant IAA biosynthesis route, other pathways, like the indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) pathway, have been proposed. The IAOx pathway has garnered attention due to its supposed activation in auxin-overproducing mutants (e.g., sur1, sur2, ugt74b1) and the auxin-like responses triggered by exogenous application of its proposed intermediates: IAOx, indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN), and indole-3-acetamide (IAM). However, despite supporting evidence for individual steps, conclusive physiological relevance of the IAOx pathway remains unproven. Using a comprehensive genetic approach combined with metabolic and phenotypic profiling, we demonstrate that mutating gene families proposed to function in the IAOx pathway does not result in prominent auxin-deficient phenotypes, nor are these genes required for high-auxin production in the sur2 mutant. Our findings also challenge the previously postulated linear IAOx pathway. While exogenously provided IAOx, IAN, and IAM can be converted to IAA in vivo, they do not act as precursors for each other. Finally, our findings question the physiological relevance of IAM and IAN as IAA precursors in plants and suggest the existence of a yet uncharacterized auxin biosynthetic route, likely involving IAOx as an intermediate, for the production of IAA in the sur2 mutant.

Protein structure prediction models, like AlphaFold (AF), offer a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional methods like X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryo-EM for determining protein structures. These models are increasingly used in protein-ligand interaction studies, a key aspect of drug discovery. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations facilitate this process, and researchers are continuously developing open-access tools for cavity detection and docking to accelerate protein-ligand interaction studies. However, while many of these tools perform well in specific cases, their strengths and weaknesses in analyzing predicted protein structures remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is crucial to compare docking analyses using experimentally determined protein structures and deep learning-based models. In this study, two well-characterized proteins, dopamine D3 receptor with its ligand ETQ and neprilysin with its ligand sacubitrilat, are used to evaluate docking predictions. The docking tools CB-Dock 2 and COACH-D are applied to both X-ray crystallography-derived structures and five different AFgenerated models. The objective is to assess the accuracy of these docking approaches and determine whether this strategy can effectively simulate macromolecular behavior in their microenvironment. By doing so, this study aims to generate new insights and contribute to accelerating research in protein-ligand interactions.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

We introduce HEAL-KGGen, an end-to-end framework that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) through a hierarchical multi-agent architecture and an automatically constructed medical knowledge graph. The system includes a General Practitioner (GP) agent for initial biomarker triage and specialist agents for genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical interpretation. The core innovation of HEAL-KGGen lies in its dynamic knowledge graph pipeline, which combines entity extraction based on patterns and semantics, ontology-aligned normalization (using UMLS, MeSH, SNOMED CT), and the construction of multi-source relationships from biomedical databases and literature. Retrieved subgraphs are transformed into contextual prompts that guide LLM reasoning via structured, explainable pathways. Our experiments show that HEAL-KGGen significantly improves question-answering accuracy across multiple mainstream large language models, with the highest improvement observed on Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieving a 43.75% increase in accuracy. These findings confirm the value of domain-specific graph knowledge in advancing LLM performance for genetic and molecular diagnostics.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

M.; Siatkowski, C. W.; Yan, C.; Thiagarajan, S.; Cooper, V. S.", "abstract": "We established a research-education partnership known as EvolvingSTEM that provides secondary school students the opportunity to conduct authentic research experiments centered on microbial evolution. These experiments are currently conducted by thousands of high school students and can offer an unprecedented window into biofilm adaptation while building a community of young researchers. Providing high school students access to research experiences improves learning and can have positive and long-lasting impacts on their attitudes towards science. Moreover, student research can make impactful scientific contributions. Through EvolvingSTEM, students evolve populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens in a biofilm bead model and observe heritable changes in colony morphology. Genome sequencing of 70 mutants that they picked identified parallel mutations in genes known to regulate biofilm growth (wsp, yfiBNR, morA, fuzY). We also uncovered novel adaptations: loss-of-function mutations in phosphodiesterase PFLU0185 that did not alter colony morphology, and mutations affecting periplasmic disulfide bond formation producing small colonies. PFLU0185 mutations consistently reached high frequencies and phenotyping revealed roles in cyclic di-GMP regulation, biofilm formation, and motility, prompting us to name this gene bmo (biofilm and motility optimizer). Competition experiments and microscopy demonstrated bmo mutants employ generalist strategies and coexist with the ancestor and specialist mutants through niche differentiation. Consequently, phenotypic diversity is maintained, with smooth (ancestral and bmo) colonies consistently outnumbering wrinkly and fuzzy variants. The study advances understanding of biofilm genetic architecture while demonstrating that student-led research can uncover mechanisms of microbial adaptation relevant to Pseudomonas infection biology and provide transformative STEM experiences. IMPORTANCE: Bacterial biofilms dominate microbial life, yet their evolutionary genetics remain incompletely understood. This science education project engages thousands of high school students in experimental evolution, yielding discoveries about biofilm adaptation while transforming their science education. Selected mutants included PFLU0185/bmo, a conserved phosphodiesterase that helps bacteria balance the competing demands of attachment and dispersal essential for biofilm life cycle success. The finding that smooth-colony generalists rather than conspicuous variants dominate biofilm adaptation adds to our understanding of the process of niche differentiation in biofilms. This work also demonstrates the power of distributed research networks for discovery of new genetic pathways of adaptation. Students gained authentic research experience, potentially inspiring them to join the next generation of scientists, while identifying mutants adapted to discrete conditions that maintain diversity within biofilms. This synergy between education and discovery offers a scalable model for addressing complex biological questions while developing scientific literacy in diverse classrooms.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Several studies have demonstrated the antagonist relationship between the two organisms via several molecular mechanisms including competition for nutrients as well as via direct killing by hydrogen peroxide. During nasal colonization, the pneumococcus is in direct contact with the fatty acid h18:0, which is released into the extracellular environment by S. aureus. We report that h18:0 is specifically toxic to the pneumococcus amongst the pathogenic streptococci, providing a unique mechanism for interspecies competition during colonization. Exposure of cells to h18:0 revealed that S. pneumoniae could rapidly adapt to and overcome the observed toxicity. Whole genome analysis revealed the mechanism underlying this resistance being linked to a truncation of a glycosyltransferase in the capsule biosynthesis locus and a genomic inversion in the phase variation locus, leading to altered cell surface charge and membrane lipid composition. These physiological differences in the resistant isolates may aid in repelling toxic, charged fatty acids such as h18:0 from the cell membrane.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Research aimed at understanding how hosts mount immune defenses against viruses and how viruses evade those immune defenses relies on host/virus pairs that have evolved together overtime, thus necessitating a need for a DNA virus model system for Drosophila with a virus that naturally infects the host. The Drosophila innubila Nudivirus (DiNV) is an emerging model system poised to take on the role as the DNA virus model for Drosophila. In this paper we describe the development of the DiNV model system with animal and cellular resources. We describe the development of new Drosophila cell lines, virus titration assays, anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and injection-based DiNV infections in Drosophila innubila. We find that D. innubila cells can be used to grow DiNV for use in further experiments, and that DiNV is highly virulent when injected into adult D. innubila.

This method is not only time-consuming but also susceptible to human error and bias. In this study, we developed a semi-automated system to track and classify cleaning interactions between the cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) and the powder blue tang (Acanthurus leucosternon) in a controlled three-dimensional laboratory setting. We employed DeepLabCut (DLC), a deep learning-based tool for markerless pose estimation, to track both fish species simultaneously. The resulting model reliably tracked both individuals with low error rates. Using the tracking data, we designed a classification algorithm that detected cleaning interactions with 90% accuracy. Although the algorithm misclassified approximately 15% of non-interactions as interactions, it successfully identified 25% of video content as containing interactions, thereby reducing the amount of footage requiring manual annotation by 75%. This approach significantly decreases human labour while maintaining high classification performance. Overall, our system represents a valuable step toward automating behavioural analysis in marine mutualisms and can serve as a foundation for broader applications in ethology and conservation research.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": ""}

Detecting short amino acid sequences, termed patterns, across lung cancer and other related datasets facilitates the identification of relevant features. This study builds on previous findings by exploring proteins that share common patterns already identified. Using sequence matching at 5% and 10% occurrence thresholds, we identified 2,368 and 47 patterns, respectively. To reduce complexity and refine the dataset, shorter patterns from the 10% occurrence streamlined the analysis by isolating highly relevant patterns while reducing redundancy among proteins sharing sequence segments. Subsequent analyses integrated structural predictions for protein folding comparison, enabling the detection of patterns in different proteins and the identification of potential key residues. During cavity detection prediction, some amino acids were inspected in detail to assess their impact on protein function and their relevance in drug-target interactions. These insights were considered during docking studies, focusing on proteins used in treatments with pre-described ligands. By connecting raw sequence data to folding structures and functional features, we identified critical protein cavities that underscore the role of mutations in altering protein behavior and influencing drug-target interactions. These findings highlight protein activity's structural foundations and their importance in understanding cancer biology.

Treatment options for IVH are limited in their ability to improve long-term functional status. One promising target for treatment is the profound cellular inflammatory response that occurs after injury, but advances have been limited by our incomplete understanding of this phenomenon. We leveraged Recovery After Cerebral Hemorrhage, a prospective, observational study at the University of Maryland, to address this question. We sought to characterize the immune cell populations in the intraventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after IVH. To do so, we generated the first reported single-nucleusRNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data on CSF after acute brain injury. We performed 10x Genomics snRNA-seq of nuclei isolated from the CSF of 7 patients (ICH=6, SAH=1), yielding 11,191 high-quality transcriptomes. We identified four major cell populations, which we annotated as neutrophils (53.8%), monocytes (26.1%), lymphocytes (17.8%), and other cells (2.4%) based on the expression of canonical gene markers. Sub-clustering revealed distinct subtypes of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes that shared features with populations previously described in the systemic circulation. Neutrophils were categorized into nascent, quiescent, and interferon-activated states. The interferon-activated state has not been observed in the central nervous system previously. Monocytes were predominantly of a classical phenotype. Lymphocytes were predominantly T-cells, with the largest populations being naive and central memory CD4+ T-cells. This snRNA-seq data informed the design of a flow cytometry panel that we used to validate the presence of cell subtypes identified by transcriptomics. This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of snRNA-seq approaches to identify previously unexplored pathways and immune cell types that may be relevant to disease.

Further, to explore the potential influence of local population distribution on individuality, we also examined isolated males without neighbours and clumped males with neighbours. Our findings indicate higher individuality at higher densities across both scenarios, measured using two individuality metrics: Beecher's information statistic and Discrimination score. Additionally, clumped males exhibited significantly lower acoustic niche overlaps compared to isolated males, suggesting that the immediate social environment might be more influential than larger-scale population density patterns.

Here, we show that nest-building zebra finches follow a copy-if-dissatisfied strategy, but only when social information aligns with recent experience: after observing a conspecific build a nest, males were more likely to choose the demonstrated 'social' material--particularly on their first choice--if they had previously used low-quality material. Using Bayesian cognitive modelling, we estimated how latent learning mechanisms underpinned males' material choices, identifying two asocial and two social governing parameters. These parameters provide the first formal evidence for the cognitive basis of birds' nest building. Forward simulations informed--but not prescripted--by these parameters approximated observed material-choice trajectories, supporting their causal role. Additional simulations targeting simplified real-world contexts showed that payoff structure--not (dis)satisfaction--drove social material choice, though higher rewards did not proportionally boost its use, offering preliminary insights into the mechanisms underlying material-use variation more broadly.

Using principal component analysis, we identified eight latent impulsivity dimensions, the top three of which together accounted for the majority of the variance across all impulsivity assessments. The first principal component (PC1) was a general impulsivity factor that mapped onto all impulsivity-related assessments. PC2 mapped onto a 'mixed' impulsivity style related to both poorer, less attentive performance on the SST and decreased delay discounting. PC3 linked externalizing behaviors across multiple measures with indices of delay discounting, making delay discounting the only impulsivity-related assessment to load on all three of the top PCs. Multiple impulsivity PCs were significantly associated with subsequent initiation of alcohol and cannabis use. Finally, we found both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between the PCs and functional connectivity between and within frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular, and default mode networks.

Neural fate commitment is characterized by transient SoxC expression, with a homeodomain code associated with neural identities.

It remains less clear whether urbanization fosters cognitive skills that require flexibility, or whether successful individuals in urban environments simply apply pre-evolved skills to solve new problems. To investigate whether variation in anthropogenic experience drives behavioural flexibility required to solve a new technical problem, we presented 42 semi-urban vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) with a three-phase foraging experiment. For this, we measured each monkey's tendency to \"raid\" human structures in their search for food to assess whether their anthropogenic experience explained individual variation in flexibility and problem-solving skills. We then used a probabilistic model to describe the series of monkeys' actions when attempting to solve the foraging experiment. This allowed us to quantify three traits encompassing individuals' behavioural flexibility: switch tendency between solutions, innovativeness, and learning sensitivity. We found that individuals' switch tendency and innovativeness were not explained by anthropogenic experience and that the three traits were unrelated to each other. Moreover, neither switch tendency, nor innovativeness predicted the monkeys' human food consumption in this habitat. Thus, our study suggests that behavioural flexibility is not driven by anthropogenic foraging experience.
