Occluded object recognition, an ethologically critical cognitive capacity, is thought to rely on recurrent processing of visual information, but it remains unclear whether and how recurrent processing improves recognition of occluded objects. Using convolutional models of the visual system, we demonstrate how a distinct form of computation arises in recurrent--but not feedforward--networks that leverages information about the occluder to \"explain-away\" the occlusion--i.e., recognition of the occluder provides an account for missing or altered features, potentially rescuing recognition of occluded objects. This occurs without any constraint placed on the computation and is observed both across a systematic architecture sweep of convolutional models and in a model explicitly constructed to approximate the primate visual system. Building on these computational results, we conduct a behavioral experiment to study explaining-away in humans, and find evidence consistent with explaining-away. Finally, to demonstrate a specific mechanism for explaining-away, we develop an experimentally inspired recurrent model that recovers fine-grained features of occluded stimuli by explaining-away. Recurrent connections' capability to explain away may extend to more general cases where undoing context-dependent changes in representations could benefit perception.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Ribosome profiling is a valuable methodology for measuring changes in a cell's translational program. The technique can report how efficiently mRNA coding sequences are translated and pinpoint positions along mRNAs where ribosomes slow down or arrest. It can also reveal when translation takes place outside coding regions, often with important regulatory consequences. While many useful software tools have emerged to facilitate analysis of these data, packages can become complex and challenging to adapt to specialized needs. We therefore introduce ribofootPrinter, a suite of Python tools designed to offer an accessible and modifiable set of code for analysis of data from ribosome profiling and related types of small RNA sequencing experiments. Read alignments are made to a simplified transcriptome to keep the code intuitive. Multiple normalization options help facilitate interpretation of data, particularly outside coding regions. We also demonstrate how the length of reads that map to the transcriptome affects the frequency of matches to multiple sites and we provide multimapper identifier files to highlight these regions. Overall, this tool has the capability to carry out sophisticated analyses while maintaining enough simplicity to make it readily understandable and adaptable.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "An exchange between potential and kinetic energy over the step has long been considered a key feature in the energetic effectiveness of human walking. However, it is difficult to identify mechanisms responsible for limiting such an exchange in human walking. This study proposes a modified definition of center-of-mass (COM) energy recovery (R_c) that quantifies the proportion of mechanical energy transferred from one step to the next while accounting for total step dissipation. Simulations show that R_c decreases nearly linearly with walking speed on level ground, indicating no preferred speed. This behavior arises from analytical formulations that neglect active work during single support (pendular motion). In contrast, empirical data reveal consistently lower R_c, likely due to elevated collision losses or negative net single-support work not captured by the analytical model. When both single- and double-support phases are considered analytically, R_c exhibits a maximum of 59.4% at 1.21 m.s^(-1), coinciding with minimal active muscle work over the step. We further show that the R_c trajectory is asymmetric, contrary to prior assumptions, and is governed by total step dissipation. Accordingly, challenging walking conditions associated with higher metabolic cost, such as restricted visual lookahead, are predicted to reduce R_c (maximum 58.5%).", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

Due to the loss of bone mass being associated with increased marrow fat, trans-differentiation of osteoblasts into adipocytes been hypothesized as a contributor to osteoporotic bone loss and fragility. Reprogramming of transcriptional networks is a prerequisite for cellular differentiation, however, to which extent cell-type specific transcriptional networks modulate cellular plasticity within stromal cells remains unknown. In this study we performed gene expression analysis at bulk and single cell level in stromal cells being repeatedly exposed to osteogenic and adipogenic inducers in vitro. Surprisingly, cell type specific gene networks are not suppressive but instead promoting to obtain an opposing phenotype, e.g., enhanced osteoblast differentiation of adipogenic pre-stimulated stromal cells compared to undifferentiated ones. Mechanistically, lineage-selective genes with enhanced response upon interconversion are primed in the stem cell state and obtain modest activity levels during exposure to opposing lineage conditions. Finally, the presence of cells simultaneously showing an osteogenic and adipogenic phenotype highlighting a strong molecular plasticity of transcriptional networks in stromal cells.

While the sensory encoding of music is well-studied, when and how infants naturally start moving to music is largely unexplored. This study simultaneously investigates infants' neural (auditory) responses and spontaneous movements to music during the first postnatal year. Neural activity (EEG) and body kinematics (markerless pose estimation) were recorded from 79 infants (aged 3, 6, and 12 months) listening to refrains of children's music, along with shuffled, high-pitched, and low-pitched versions of the same songs. Neural data revealed that, across all ages, infants exhibit enhanced auditory responses to music compared to shuffled music, indicating that auditory encoding of music emerges early in development. Movement data revealed a different outcome. While coarse auditory-motor coupling is present at all ages, more complex structured movement patterns emerge in response to music only by 12 months. Notably, no age group demonstrated evidence of coordinated movements to music. Additionally, enhanced auditory responses to high vs low pitch were only evident at 6 months, while infants' movements were better predicted by high-pitched compared to low-pitched music at all ages. This study provides initial insights into how the developing brain gradually transforms music into spontaneous movements of increasing complexity.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a reward circuitry hub, is central to stress- and depression-related pathology. While NAc medium spiny neuron (MSN) transcriptional adaptations have been characterized in stressed male rodents, much less is known about female adaptations. To address this, we exposed female D1-Cre-RiboTag and A2A-Cre-RiboTag mice to chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS) and classified them as high- or low-social interactors. Ribosome-associated mRNA was isolated from MSN subtypes and analyzed by RNA sequencing, differential gene expression analysis (DEG), and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Cross-species consensus WGCNA with male mouse and human transcriptomic datasets was performed to identify conserved, sex-specific signatures. We detected 9 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in D1-MSNs and 630 in A2A-MSNs (FDR < 0.05). In D1-MSNs, DEGs were primarily upregulated in low interactors and enriched for energy homeostasis and cell adhesion. A2A-MSN DEGs included upregulated structural genes and downregulated neurotransmission-related genes. WGCNA identified 9 significant D1- and 5 significant A2A-MSN modules, with the most impacted enriched for PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and regulated by Nf1. Consensus analysis revealed a stress-associated, sex- and subtype-specific module enriched for PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling conserved across mice and humans.

In this basic physiology study, we used a uniquely designed processing protocol of urine collection to characterize the variation of uEV excretion and cargo throughout a 24 hour period in healthy subjects. Thirteen healthy adults collected every individual void over 24 hours and these voids were independently analyzed along with a composite sample intended to recreate a 24 hour collection sample. uEVs were enriched by low-speed centrifugation with three low-ionic-strength washes to minimize uromodulin contamination. Size, concentration, morphology and cargo of uEVs were characterized with nanoparticle tracking analysis, cryo-electron microscopy, immunoblotting and single EV flow cytometry. We observed a stable urine creatinine excretion into the urine over the day. uEV concentrations varied up to 100-fold across the day between individuals with a decreasing trend over time with the result close to reaching statistical significance (p=0.06). uEV concentration was positively associated with urine creatinine, specific gravity, and TSG101, an EV marker. The association between urine flow and uEV excretion varied across the day. Most tested uEV cargo markers exhibited substantial within individual variation over the day without consistent trends in our healthy cohort. When grouped into predefined time periods to visualize temporal patterns, a transient dip at noon was observed, followed by a significant increase in the subsequent period, consistent with a pattern previously reported.

Conversely, the geometry of structures modulates how these three aspects of organic form manifest in different taxonomic groups and ecological circumstances, raising challenges to causal inferences. Here, I apply the familiar logarithmic helicospiral (logspiral) model for coiled shells, to assess its fit to data on gastropods, and to study allometry, covariation and constraint in coiling behavior, in light of adaptationist and proximate mechanistic explanations. I derive convenient expressions for the three-way relationship between expansion rate, apical angle and downward lead angle of spiral paths on shells. Combining several published datasets, I find that centerline spirals of gastropod shells follow isometrically growing conical logspirals. Allometry manifests in the relative growth of apertures. Both empirical patterns and theoretical arguments further suggest that the relation between apical angle and expansion rate, usually attributed to economical and mechanical demands, can equally be explained by taxon-specific lead angles and plasticity in growth. Consequently, the lead angle emerges as a more biologically meaningful coiling parameter. I relate results to the longstanding methodological problem of confusing spire-height allometry with incorrect longitudinal origin of measurement, and to empirically derived patterns of covariation of coiling parameters and morphometric traits in gastropods. More generally, I demonstrate dangers of relying on only single methods, or on generic formulas and workflows, and that geometry dictates particular \"laws of form\" that have practical use in data analyses and integration, and need to be fully acknowledged when seeking causal adaptationist or mechanistic explanations.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

In the curent work, we recast metastatic spread in terms of tumor age and generational ancestry, turning an implicit notion into the main organizing principle of the model. Building on the classical Iwata-Kawasaki-Shigesada (IKS) framework, we construct a transformation from size to age and derive a hierarchy of integral equations indexed by metastatic generation. Our reformulation yields closed-form expressions for first-generation metastases and simple one-dimensional recursive integrals for higher generations, avoiding direct numerical solution of the original size-structured partial differential equation (PDE) with its nonlocal boundary condition. Using Gompertzian growth and power-law metastatic emission, we show that the age-generation model reproduces IKS predictions over clinically relevant time scales while offering improved numerical stability and interpretability. The generational decomposition reveals a robust pattern: lesions seeded directly from the primary dominate early in the disease course, whereas successively younger generations, emitted by existing metastases, come to dominate the total lesion count at small sizes, leaving older generations to occupy the macroscopic tail of the distribution. Introducing an explicit detection threshold naturally separates a small number of radiologically visible macrometastases from a much larger, unseen pool of micrometastases. Together, these results provide a transparent and computationally efficient framework that links primary-tumor growth, metastatic seeding across generations, and the hidden microscopic burden that underlies clinical presentation.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

The Drosophila p53 gene produces four mRNA isoforms, yet their individual contributions to nucleolar stress responses remain poorly understood. Using newly designed isoform-specific qPCR primers, we found that although all p53 isoforms exhibit moderate transcriptional changes following Noc1 reduction, the truncated isoform p53E is robustly and preferentially upregulated. Notably, p53E lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain and has been reported to negatively regulate p53-induced apoptosis in specific tissues. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that {gamma}-H2AV accumulation arises from caspase-dependent apoptosis rather than primary genomic lesions, suggesting the activation of a p53-dependent stress pathway distinct from canonical genotoxic pathways.

Here, we used Pax7CreERT2;RosaYFP mice (MuSCYFP) to label Pax7-expressing MuSCs and chronologically traced MusCs until geriatric age. Genetic labeling and chronological tracing revealed that the number of YFP+ MuSC remained comparable between young, middle and geriatric ages. At geriatric age, YFP+ MuSCs exhibited reduced expression of traditional MuSC markers such as VCAM1 and PAX7. A previously unrecognized subpopulation emerged, characterized by loss of VCAM1 and low or absent PAX7. Despite their altered marker profile, these cells retained transcriptional signatures of quiescence and myogenic potential, but displayed significantly reduced proliferative and regenerative capacities. They displayed gene expression patterns indicative of senescence-like state and were selectively ablated by senolytic treatment. DHT restored regenerative function in aged mice and re-induced VCAM1 expression in YFP+/Pax7-/low/VCAM1- cells, indicating responsiveness to rejuvenation. Based on their emergence with aging, functional impairment and responsiveness to rejuvenation, we termed this population GERI-MuSCs (Geriatric Emerging Rejuvenation-responsive and Impaired MuSCs).

In this study, we operationalized adolescent substance use along three dimensions--intent, access, and family-developmental history--and trained predictive models of each facet using resting-state connectivity. Trait impulsivity, a known risk factor, was also examined. Using Baseline and 2 Year Follow-Up data from the ABCD Bids Community Collection (ABCC), we found that prediction was more successful at follow-up than baseline. At baseline, predictive accuracy was modest and intent to use substances was the most accurately predicted facet. Prediction accuracies at follow-up were much higher, with access and family-developmental history being better predicted, signaling a developmental shift in the brain--behavior mapping of substance use vulnerabilities. These findings suggest that the neurobiological correlates of substance use are dynamic across adolescence, possibly reflecting changing phenotype.

In many insects, reproductive diapause shows clinal variation along environmental gradients such as photoperiod and temperature. How such continuous trait variation may be encoded at the molecular level and maintained in the presence of gene flow remains largely elusive. The fruit fly Drosophila triauraria is distributed across a wide latitudinal range of the Japanese archipelago. Northern strains exhibit a strong photoperiodic reproductive diapause in females, whereas southern strains fail to arrest ovarian development even under short-day conditions at low temperatures. These distinct phenotypes and the presumable clinal variation in between, provide an ideal opportunity to examine the molecular basis of latitudinal divergence. We first investigated diapause induction in both females and males from previously reported and newly tested strains collected from the regions spanning ~26-43{degrees}N along the Japanese archipelago.. The assessment revealed continuous geographic variation in sensitivity to photoperiod and temperature. We then analyzed the whole-genome sequences of 21 strains, including 14 newly sequenced, to identify genomic regions underlying this divergence. In addition to the conventional FST analysis, we applied a \"monophyletic window\" approach suitable for limited sample sizes. The analysis identified a candidate region containing putative E-box and TER-box sequence motifs of the timeless (tim) gene, which has been previously implicated in diapause regulation in multiple insect species. The quantitative PCR analysis further supported a partial association between the tim expression and the incidence of female diapause.

Methods: We employed three mouse ICC models, four clinical ICC patient datasets, and three spatial transcriptomic platforms to chart the macrophage landscape over time and space. Cell-cell communication analysis plus phosphoproteomics guided functional validation via TAM-ICC co-culture, cytokine treatment, gene silencing/knockout, orthotopic and metastatic ICC models, and three conditional knockout mice.

Further, M{varphi}_SPP1 drove ICC cell proliferation via the OSM-OSMR-STAT3-CCND1 and promoted invasion through THBS1-CD47-mTOR-DBN1 signalling.

Controls exhibited low to undetectable microbial translocation in plasma. By contrast, plasma Streptococcus and several S. species displayed CUD-specific oral enrichment and evidence of translocation into the bloodstream. In vitro, cocaine selectively enhanced S. parasanguinis growth, consistent with CUD-enriched oral pathobionts and translocation into circulation in vivo. S. parasanguinis, but not cocaine alone, induced IL-1{beta} and TNF- production in human primary monocytes. scRNAseq further revealed innate immune activation, impaired T cell function, and heightened susceptibility to infection in CUD. Conclusions. This is the first study demonstrating that CUD via smoking or snorting exhibited oral microbial dysbiosis and selective oral-to-blood microbial translocation in vivo. These findings suggest that a compromised oral-to-blood barrier, rather than cocaine itself, promotes immune perturbations in CUD.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

HS2PM stably records deep-layer membrane potentials from over 160 neurons simultaneously, with minimal photobleaching and phototoxicity.

Mouse models of progeria recapitulate pathological ageing phenotypes seen in patients, including cardiovascular defects, increased cellular senescence, systemic inflammation, DNA damage accumulation, and shortened lifespan. In cultured cells from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) patients, the human p53 isoform {Delta}133p53 was previously shown to inhibit p53-mediated cellular senescence, proinflammatory IL-6 production, and DNA damage accumulation, and to extend cellular replicative lifespan. Here we show that, in a heterozygous HGPS mouse model, transgenic expression of {Delta}133p53 reproduces these in vitro-observed effects across multiple organs in vivo and extends median lifespan by 11% (387 versus 349 days, P = 0.0379). In the aorta and skin, {Delta}133p53 abrogates progeria-characteristic pathological changes and preserves tissue integrity. Our data further suggest that {Delta}133p53 may promote a broad spectrum of ageing-counteracting mechanisms, including bone homeostasis, metabolic fitness, antioxidant defense, youthful epigenome, and tissue stemness. Together with the anti-inflammatory and tissue-preserving effects of {Delta}133p53 in naturally aged mice and its age-associated downregulation in human tissues, this study suggests that {Delta}133p53-based therapeutic strategies may be applicable not only to HGPS but also as broader interventions for preventing or delaying ageing.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

While imaging studies provide (micro)structural insights into brain changes across the ovarian cycle and pregnancy, the high resolution, single-cell map of the brain across reproductive transitions is missing. Here, we performed multiome (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) analysis of the mouse ventral hippocampus (vHIP) across sex, estrous cycle, and peripartum period at single cell resolution. We identify dynamic changes in vHIP cellular composition across the estrous cycle and pregnancy, including in the neural stem cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), enabling hormone-driven neurogenesis. Major gene expression changes are neuronal function-relevant, cell type-specific, and found in excitatory neurons of CA1, CA3, and DG subfields, across sex and reproductive transitions. In contrast, chromatin accessibility changes are more extensive and found across cell types, likely driven by estrogen level shifts in both within-female and between-sex comparisons. We show that chromatin remodeling during the estrous cycle primes the genome for gene expression changes during pregnancy and is also enriched for brain disease-relevant genes. Finally, we reveal a thyroid hormone transporter (Transthyretin, Ttr) gene as the major candidate gene that drives structural and behavioral changes across the estrous cycle and pregnancy.

Here, we examined how anxiety influences the segmentation of continuous experience into discrete events. Using a large-scale open-access dataset and data-driven methods to detect neural event boundaries, we compared neural event segmentation between healthy adults with high (N=60) and low trait-level anxiety (N=60) as they viewed a short suspenseful film. While the overall temporal event segmentation hierarchy was preserved across groups, higher-anxiety individuals had more idiosyncratic boundaries, exhibiting reduced alignment to both low-anxiety individuals and one another. This divergence was the most pronounced in the dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks, suggesting that anxiety-related disruptions in top-down attentional control may contribute to less consistent segmentation. Furthermore, boundary variability in anxious participants was higher during moments rated as more anxiety-provoking by a large language model, controlling for arousal, valence, and low-level visual features. Together, these findings suggest that idiosyncratic event models in anxious individuals result in non-normative organization of continuous experience, leading to more individualized and inconsistent event boundaries. Such variability in segmentation may have downstream consequences for prediction, memory, and social cognition, offering a potential neural mechanism by which anxiety influences the interpretation and recall of everyday experiences.

Here, we show that this alignment and prior failures depend on the underlying coding scheme. First, we examined neural representations of variables related to visual memory in macaque inferotemporal cortex. We found that spikes and HGA were strikingly aligned for variables encoded as population response magnitude (novelty, recency, and memorability). However, a variable encoded as a distributed pattern of activity (category) was misaligned.

Although metabolic dysregulation and neuropeptide imbalance have been linked to these disorders, the functional consequences of such imbalance and its potential for therapeutic reversal remain poorly understood. Our previous work identified chromogranin A, which encodes a pro-hormone for several metabolic peptides, as a key regulator of Tau pathology. Here, we investigate Catestatin, a chromogranin A derived peptide that is a potent inhibitor of catecholamine release and has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and lower peripheral blood pressure. We report significant reductions in CST levels in the hippocampus and cortex of AD brains, as well as in the frontal cortex of CBD and the basal ganglia of PSP. Supplementing CST in cortical neuronal cultures and organotypic slice cultures decreased Tau phosphorylation and aggregation. In vivo, CST administration in PS19 Tauopathy mice reduced pathological Tau species, attenuated gliosis, and improved cognitive function. CST treatment also lowered amyloid plaque burden and neuroinflammation in 5XFAD mice. Mechanistically, CST decreased epinephrine levels in both PS19 and 5XFAD mice and suppressed downstream protein kinase A hyperactivation in PS19 and OTSC. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized neuropeptidergic mechanism linking CST deficiency to elevated adrenergic receptor, epinephrine and PKA stress signaling and Tauopathy driven neurodegeneration, suggesting CST replacement as a promising therapeutic approach.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

However, how MITA GOFs are spontaneously activated remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that the activity of MITA hinge-region GOFs is compromised by an additional mutation at Lys150 and that the SAVI phenotypes of MITAN153S/WT mice are completely abolished in the MITAK150N/N153S (MITANS/NS) mice. Mechanistically, MITA GOFs constitutively associate with iRhom2 for the spontaneous ER-to-Golgi translocation, which is substantially inhibited by the introduction of a mutation at Lys150. Interestingly, cGAMP binds to MITANS, triggers the ER-to-Golgi translocation of MITANS as well as the MITANS-iRhom2 interaction, and induces the expression of downstream genes in MitaNS/NS cells similarly as in Mita+/+ cells. Consistently, structural studies demonstrate an inactive open conformation of apo-MITANS characterized by connector region crossover and a curved filament of cGAMP-bound MITANS characterized by parallel connector regions, similar to those observed in wild-type MITA. Furthermore, we design a SAVI-inhibitory peptide (SIP) that selectively inhibits the interaction between MITAN153S and iRhom2 and the activity of MITA GOFs and thereby abolishes the SAVI phenotypes of the MITAN153S/WT[-&gt;]WT chimeric mice.

In this study, we found that MOSPD3, an atypical VAP family protein, acts an adaptor that recruits ATG2A to the ER. MOSPD3 colocalizes with ATG2A and is specifically enriched at ER sites juxtaposed with the IM during autophagosome formation. Recruitment is mediated by direct interactions between the FFNT (two phenylalanines in a neutral tract) motif in the N-terminal region (NT) of ATG2A and the major sperm protein (MSP) domain of MOSPD3. Co-expression of MOSPD3 with ATG2A-NT, but not a MOSPD3-binding-defective mutant ATG2A-NT-T362A, markedly rescued the autophagic defect caused by ATG2A/B double knockout (DKO).

In this study we employed a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) system that integrated time-synchronized high-density electroencephalography with three-dimensional motion capture during a touchscreen visual working memory task requiring dynamic upper extremity reach responses. Using this framework we examined how increasing memory load (e.g. from 1-disc to 4-discs) influences behavior and scalp-recorded neural activity when cognitive and motor processes are coupled within a single task, and whether these effects are modulated by handedness. Increasing memory load reliably degraded working memory task performance and slowed motor preparation while core movement execution measures remained largely preserved. Regarding electroencephalography data, parieto-occipital activity increased with load during both the early visual-evoked N1 and the delay period However, load-related modulation reached a plateau at the 3-disc condition during the delay period only. Posterior-frontal engagement also strengthened as load increased, consistent with demands on attentional control memory maintenance and sensorimotor planning. Brain-behavior associations were most robust at a moderate 2-disc level where contralateral delay activity correlated with both cognitive and motor performance measures. Finally, although handedness exerted selective behavioral effects it did not modulate load-related parieto-occipital neural activity Together these findings demonstrate that a multimodal MoBI approach captures integrated cognitive-motor dynamics during working memory guided actions, providing a more comprehensive characterization of behavior and underlying neural signatures than either modality alone This framework offers a translational approach for studying cognitive-motor interactions and their potential disruption in neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

Most existing deep learning models are trained on large proxy datasets derived from high-throughput assays; however, their performance often degrades when evaluated on experimentally validated off-target sites. This limitation raises concerns about the generalization ability of proxy-trained models and highlights the need for architectures that better transfer to biologically relevant benchmarks such as TrueOT. We propose a two-stage deep learning framework that decouples sequence representation learning from off-target classification. In the first stage, guide RNA sequences are encoded using pretrained transformer-based embeddings learned from large genomic corpora. In the second stage, a hybrid neural network integrates these embeddings with mismatch-level and sequence-pair features to predict off-target activity. Models are trained exclusively on a proxy dataset and evaluated under strict external validation on the TrueOT benchmark. Our results show that incorporating pretrained sequence embeddings substantially improves generalization performance. The full two-stage model achieves consistent improvements in ROC-AUC and PR-AUC on TrueOT, relative to proxy-only baselines, across repeated runs. We demonstrate a consistent generalization effect under distribution shift, robust to training noise, seeds, and evaluation variance.

They represent an important class of potentially druggable binding sites. Reliably predicting cryptic pockets capable of binding ligands, however, remains a challenge. Herein we examine the use of AlphaFold 3 (AF3) for generating realistic conformational ensembles that include known cryptic pockets. We find that AF3 is generally able to reproduce the scale of conformational change required for cryptic site formation. When given a cryptic-site ligand for the protein, AF3 predominantly predicts conformations competent to bind the ligand in the cryptic site; without the ligand, conformations lacking the cryptic pocket generally dominate. While the results may reflect a bias toward memorized structural priors, the level of detrimental memorization appears to be limited. We also show that the choice of the ligand can significantly impact the predictions, and that AF3 is able to produce models with the ligand correctly positioned. Variability in ligand position, however, suggests that generating ensembles of co-folded predictions is critical to enhancing the likelihood of obtaining a correct binding mode. Overall, AF3-generated protein-ligand structural ensembles have potential utility in cryptic-site drug discovery, and they can reveal ligands likely to bind to those sites.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

Under ex vivo and in vitro conditions, AbpX assembles into a para-crystalline lattice composed of semiflexible fibrils. CryoEM analysis of recombinant AbpX fibrils reveals that the precursor protein polymerizes through donor strand complementation (DSC), a process previously reported for chaperone-usher fimbriae in Gram-negative bacteria. Unlike the latter DSC protein polymers, AbpX undergoes chaperone-free polymerization in the presence of calcium ions, which are sequestered at the donor strand-acceptor groove interface between protomers in the fibril. Using a combination of cryoEM and crystallographic structural information, an atomic model is proposed for the AbpX lattice that provides insight into its potential role in biofilm formation. These findings suggest that calcium ion coordination triggers fibril assembly and pre-organizes the fibrils for incorporation into the protein lattice.

However, the cell-type specificity of brain miRs and tRFs remains poorly characterized, limiting the interpretation of their function. To address this issue, we generated a comprehensive, cell-type-resolved atlas of miRs and tRFs from live human brain tissues. Specifically, we isolated neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes from neurosurgery-obtained fresh human brain samples and profiled their miR and tRF repertoires using small RNA-sequencing. Our atlas revealed multiple differences in miR and tRF expression between the four cell types and consequently identified novel cell-type markers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR cell-type specificity may be regulated by quantitative trait loci located in cell-type-associated enhancer regions. We also report higher levels of 5'-tRNA halves in neurons compared to glia, including a particular neuronal enrichment of 5'-tRNA halves derived from glycine, leucine and lysine tRNAs. These neuronal tRFs were significantly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease postmortem brain samples compared to age-matched controls, possibly reflecting a neuronal response to disease. Our atlas, together with an accompanying statistical tool for miR cell-type enrichment analysis, provides a publicly available resource for delineating small RNA cell-type origin and function in the human brain.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

This study investigates age-related behavioural changes and their correlation with microglial function in female Sprague Dawley rats across their lifespan. Using a longitudinal design at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months of age, we assessed motor performance, mood-related behaviours, and spatial cognition alongside microglial morphometric analysis in key brain regions. Results showed that motor and cognitive performance began to decline significantly at 12 months, with severe impairments and depressive-like behaviours appearing by 24 months. These deficits were paralleled by progressive gliosis in the hippocampus and striatum. Microglial morphometric analysis further indicated a more reactive, region-dependent phenotype, with cells in the striatum adopting a smaller area, reduced perimeter, and fewer intersections. These findings provide compelling evidence for significant age-dependent deterioration in motor performance, mood regulation, and cognitive abilities in female rats. Our data strongly suggest an underlying progression of neurobiological changes, with microglial dysfunction and neuroinflammation being central candidates. This research contributes valuable insights into the cellular correlates of behavioural decline across the female lifespan, serving as a reference for the multifaceted changes that occur during normal aging.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

Connectome analyses position the neurons on top of a layered brain circuit, which recruits a specific population of descending neurons to control forward walking independently of turning and other parameters. As predicted by the connectome, the circuit enforces straight walking when activated unilaterally, and the activity of the central brain neurons represents a high-level walking drive. This drive is suppressed during flight but flexibly integrated with other control signals to enable complex movement sequences during obstacle negotiation. Together, our findings elucidate a dedicated brain circuit that enables efficient computation, selection, and integration of forward-walking signals for context-appropriate motor control.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

Although peripheral transduction has been defined in detail, the central circuits and neuromodulatory mechanisms that translate nociceptor activity into escape decisions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine targeted behavioral perturbations with anatomical tracing to delineate a nociception to escape pathway that engages dopaminergic modulation of mushroom body (MB) output. Kir2.1 mediated silencing across candidate neurotransmitter systems revealed a specific requirement for MB innervating dopaminergic neurons (DANs), particularly subsets within the PPL1 and PAM clusters, for robust nociception induced escape. Anterograde trans Tango tracing from painless and trpA1 expressing nociceptors labeled these MB dopaminergic neurons as direct postsynaptic partners, consistent with convergence of distinct nociceptor inputs onto a shared dopaminergic pathway. Finally, silencing a subset of mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) delayed escape without overtly disrupting baseline locomotion, supporting a model in which dopaminergic signaling recruits MB output to shape defensive action selection. Together, our results define a multi layer circuit motif linking peripheral nociception to MB dependent escape and provide a framework for dissecting how neuromodulation gates rapid defensive behaviors.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

Here we show that exosomes derived from fetal chorion trophoblast cells (CTCs) restore P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter function in inflammation-impaired maternal decidual cells (DECs) at the feto-maternal interface. CTCs maintain high P-gp expression under inflammatory stress, whereas DECs exhibit marked downregulation of transporter genes and proteins. Proteomic analysis revealed that CTC-derived exosomes package P-gp as a stable cargo that enters DECs through clathrin and heparan sulfate dependent uptake pathways. Delivery of CTC exosomes reinstated P-gp abundance and efflux capacity in LPS-stimulated or P-gp-deficient DECs, as shown by calcein efflux and immunofluorescence assays. In pregnant P gp knockout mice, exosome treatment restored systemic clearance of the P gp substrate tacrolimus and improved pharmacokinetic parameters. These findings establish exofection as a naturally occurring mechanism of transporter rescue at the feto-maternal interface, where fetal exosomes compensate for inflammation-induced maternal loss of efflux capacity. By restoring P gp mediated barrier function, exofection provides a protective strategy that limits the accumulation of xenobiotics and cytokines in maternal tissues and safeguards the fetus.

We also show that in postprandially high glucose, glucose-bound GK interacts and inhibits KATP, as assessed by immunoprecipitation and FRET-FLIM analyses, as well as patch clamping. In addition, we have utilized GK mutants identified in diabetics, demonstrating that those mutants defective in binding to glucose impair GLP-1 secretion in however high glucose, whereas mutants constitutively bound to glucose with defects in catalysis, promote GLP-1 secretion even in low glucose. Furthermore, the KATP mutant unable to bind to GK blocks GLP-1 secretion in high glucose.

We trained and compared several machine learning models to assess performance. Twenty-three volunteers with no prior laparoscopic experience performed a virtual reality-based laparoscopic double-grasper task while hemodynamic activity over frontal and motor cortical areas was recorded using eighteen fNIRS channels. Alongside fNIRS, we collected subjective workload (NASA-TLX), error numbers, and a VR gentleness score. This task involves using two grasper tools simultaneously to perform the tissue like balloon manipulation in a VR environment. We extracted temporal features (slope, RMS, standard deviation) and trained machine learning models to classify performance levels based on cortical activation. Labels were binarized as low vs. high using median splits for the gentleness score. Models were evaluated with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and summarized by accuracy. Results showed stronger right-frontal HbO activity and increased left-motor HbR responses in the low-performance group, suggesting greater cognitive effort and less efficient motor strategies during VR-based laparoscopic manipulation. Across classifiers and feature sets, slope-based features consistently outperformed variability- and amplitude-based metrics. Among the tested models, HbR slope features achieved the best overall classification performance, with the highest accuracy obtained using K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest classifiers (accuracy {approx} 0.89, AUC up to 0.97).

Only a few studies have examined VWM utilization when participants were allowed to interact with the environment and found that participants often preferred to resample their environment rather than rely on VWM storage. However, since eye movements were not controlled in these studies, the link between VWM utilization and free visual exploration remained unknown. In two experiments (N = 40), we investigated how visual exploration shapes reliance on VWM versus perceptual input. Participants searched for a common target across two item sets and could either store multiple items for comparison or repeatedly resample the sets by switching between them. Results revealed that when switching was achieved through eye movements, participants consistently relied more on visual resampling and less on VWM; in contrast, when switching required a manual response, they shifted toward greater VWM use. This pattern persisted even when peripheral input was equated, suggesting that natural exploration through eye movements reduces the cognitive cost of acquiring visual information, leading to a strategic reduction in VWM use.

We show that this dormant state is established in specific fetal HSCs that evade the activation of Notch signaling within the fetal liver niche, rather than through global loss of pathway activity. Genetic and transient perturbation of Notch signaling reveals a narrow developmental window in during which reduced Notch exposure promotes entry into a durable dormancy program, whereas irreversible pathway disruption compromises long-term function. Notably, transient Notch during fetal development, but not in adult BM, induces HSC quiescence while enhancing long-term repopulation capacity.

Therefore, accurately predicting essential genes is of great scientific importance and has many applications in basic research and the biomedical field. In this study, we propose EssTFNet, a novel and interpretable deep learning framework that combines adaptive time - frequency analysis with a DNA language model to achieve accurate prediction of human essential genes while enabling mechanistic biological interpretation. Specifically, EssTFNet leverages the architecture of ATFNet, which innovatively maps DNA and protein sequences into equivalent time-series signals to extract periodic and non-stationary features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex sequence patterns.

Reciprocal gardens, established a decade ago, are composed of different A. gerardi ecotypes sourced along a rainfall gradient (MAP 480 to 1167mm/yr) and sown as ecological communities.

From our analysis, we find that interface hot spots are typically concentrated on the paratope (antibody side) of the interface, indicating that paratopes typically function as hot spot rich environments in which the antigen can bind. Additionally, we observe that hot spot formation on both sides of the interface is particularly enriched by Trp and Tyr residues, underscoring the key role of aromatic side chains with some amphiphilic character in antibody design. Furthermore, we find that when strong interface hot spots are detected, they tend to persist in the apo conformation, suggesting that there is an inherent structural stability that surrounds core interface hot spots.

L.; Teige, I.", "abstract": "Although checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, responses are largely restricted to targeting CTLA-4 and PD-(L)1. TNFR2 has been identified as a target of interest, but a lack of understanding of whether agonists or blockers should be used, and whether Fc{gamma}R interactions promote efficacy, has hampered therapeutic antibody development. Here, we engineered two distinct -TNFR2 types: ligand-blocking Fc{gamma}R-engaging versus non-ligand-blocking agonist antibodies. Both showed potent anti-tumor efficacy across multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models and combined effectively with -PD-1. The ligand-blocking antibody depleted intratumoral T regs and reprogrammed the myeloid compartment, directing monocytes towards a pro-inflammatory macrophage and dendritic cell trajectory. Surprisingly, this effect depended on both inhibitory and activating Fc{gamma}Rs. In contrast, the agonist directly co-stimulated T and NK cells, through partially Fc{gamma}R-independent mechanisms. Both antibodies converged on activating tumor-specific CD8+ T cells mediating tumor rejection. Clinical assessment of both ligand-blocking (BI-1808) and agonist (BI-1910) -TNFR2 antibodies is currently ongoing.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Provirus induction diversifies adaptive variation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa lysogen populations", "doi": "10.64898/2026.01.04.697566", "authors": "Suttenfield, L. C.; Mercado, M.; Jose, S.; Hassan, A.; Whitaker, R. J.", "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that forms chronic infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Often P. aeruginosa strains are lysogens, infected with proviruses, that are induced by cellular stressors which include challenge with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. We asked how infection of P. aeruginosa with Mu-like provirus DMS3 would alter the evolution of antibiotic resistance through serial transfer of six replicates of four strain backgrounds, with and without sublethal doses of ciprofloxacin over 20 days. Through population metagenome sequencing we found that inducing lysogen populations had significantly higher diversity in adaptive mutations than non-lysogens after 20 days. Lysogen populations have more co-existing mutations within the population and a higher number of mutations in adaptive genes, including antibiotic efflux pump and gyrase alleles, and CRISPR-Cas loci. These data suggest that viral induction shifts the adaptive regime of a clonal population from one of stepwise periodic selective sweeps to recurrent competing mutations. Our results demonstrate the way that provirus infection can shape the evolutionary trajectory of their hosts in an environment-dependent manner.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}

F.; Wang, T.", "abstract": "Somatic variant detection is technically challenging due to low variant allele fractions, the confounding presence of germline variation, and reference bias. Linear references such as GRCh38 miss sample-specific variation, causing misalignments and incorrect variant calls. Although telomere-to-telomere donor-specific assemblies (DSAs) accurately represent individual genomes, their application is limited by cost and technical barriers. Alternatively, the graph-based human pangenome provides a scalable framework to improve read alignment and perform genome inference. Here, we benchmarked somatic variant detection using GRCh38, graph-based pangenomes, and pangenome-inferred DSAs with a HapMap mixture dataset and the COLO829 melanoma cell line. Pangenome-guided alignment improves read mapping and somatic variant calling accuracy. Furthermore, personalized pangenomes partially reconstruct donor-specific genomic content, improving accuracy, reducing germline contamination, and enabling detection of events in loci absent or poorly represented in GRCh38. These findings demonstrate that graph-based and personalized pangenomes are effective strategies for enhancing somatic variant detection compared with GRCh38.", "date": "2026-01-04", "journal": ""}
