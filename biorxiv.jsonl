Identifying TCR/antigen binding pairs from the large TCR repertoire and antigen space is crucial for biomedical research. Here, we introduce copepodTCR, an open-access tool for the design and interpretation of high-throughput experimental assays to determine TCR specificity. copepodTCR implements a combinatorial peptide pooling scheme for efficient experimental testing of T cell responses against large overlapping peptide libraries, useful for \"deorphaning\" TCRs of unknown specificity. The scheme detects experimental errors and, coupled with a hierarchical Bayesian model for unbiased results interpretation, identifies the response-eliciting peptide for a TCR of interest out of hundreds of peptides tested using a simple experimental set-up. We experimentally validated our approach on a library of 253 overlapping peptides covering the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We provide experimental guides for efficient design of larger screens covering thousands of peptides which will be crucial for the identification of antigen-specific T cells and their targets from limited clinical material.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

However, the physiological and transcriptomic features of the cells residing in the invasive leading edge (LE), including both neurons and glioblastoma cells (GBCs), remain unclear, challenging our comprehension of the glioblastoma pathophysiology. Methods: To elucidate molecular and morphophysiological features of LE cells, we established an experimental workflow enabling the investigation of GBCs and neurons within cancer-infiltrated organotypic tissue specimens from the same patients. With this approach, we characterized the electrophysiological properties of cells in the neocortical tumor LE (LE cells). We further performed single-cell Patch-seq experiments, enabling transcriptomic analysis of electrophysiologically recorded LE cells. Results: Upon depolarization, 58% of LE cells exhibited aberrant action potentials (aAPs). Electrophysiological assessment showed that a subset of GBCs generated aAPs, with no significant differences in aAP properties compared to LE neurons. Transcriptomic analysis of 144 LE cells revealed four transcriptomic clusters, including two GBC populations and two neuronal populations. LE GBCs exhibited diverse cellular states, including mesenchymal-like, astrocyte-like, neural progenitor-like, and oligodendrocyte-precursor cell-like phenotypes. Notably, LE GBCs exhibiting aAPs displayed reduced mitotic pathway activity and developmental regulatory ion channel CaV1.2. Cell-cell interaction analysis illustrates a higher signaling interaction between aAP LE cells compared to no-aAP LE cells. Conclusion: In summary, we find comparable electrical properties between neurons and a subset of GBCs in the leading edge, suggesting an active electrophysiological role of GBCs in the tumor's pathophysiology.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

In many other vertebrates including humans and teleost fish, however, androgens facilitate these behaviors directly via the androgen receptor without aromatization into estrogens. Here we report that mutagenesis-derived male medaka fish lacking Cyp19a1b (a subtype of aromatase predominantly expressed in the brain) exhibit severely impaired male-typical mating and aggression, despite elevated brain androgen levels. These phenotypes can be rescued by estrogen administration, indicating that brain-derived estrogens are pivotal for male-typical behaviors even in teleosts. Our results further suggest that these estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen action in the brain via the direct stimulation of androgen receptor transcription. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated mode of action of brain-derived estrogens in shaping male-typical behaviors.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Yet, the mechanisms underlying the interactions between the sensory and emotional aspects of chronic pain remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of FKBP51, a regulator of the stress response, in mediating both sensory and emotional symptoms of chronic pain. Inhibition of FKBP51, via genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade, in persistent joint pain reduced fast-onset sensory, functional and activity-related symptoms, as well as late anxio-depressive comorbidities. FKBP51 inhibition after the establishment of the hypersensitive state provided only temporary symptoms relief, while acute inhibition at disease onset protected from the full development of sensory and anxio-depressive symptoms for up to 6 months. Our results also indicated that early pain symptoms could predict the late sensory and emotional outcomes of chronic pain. RNA sequencing of spinal cord tissue revealed that late FKBP51 inhibition transiently altered nociceptive genes associated with mechanical hypersensitivity. In contrast, early inhibition persistently downregulated the Naaa gene, a key regulator of the transition to chronic pain, and reorganized spinal cilia. Our results indicate that early FKBP51 inhibition after injury can persistently reduce chronic pain and prevent the onset of associated emotional comorbidities by modulating critical spinal neurobiological pathways that play pivotal roles in the transition to chronic pain.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Pareto optimality describes how trade-offs between optimal solutions account for variation, predicting that the boundary points of a data distribution reflect specialized functions. We hypothesized that Pareto optimality dominates transcriptomic variation across all cell types. We used the Tabula Sapiens atlas of single-cell RNA sequencing across cell types and tissues in the human body to test this hypothesis and discovered that most cell types adhere to this theory. This enabled us to use this principled method to characterize the functions performed by each cell type. These phenotypes are derived from an unbiased approach and do not incorporate ideas from existing biological models or theories, and yet in many cases they recapitulate our understanding of the functions of major cell types. Ultimately, we conclude that multi-objective optimization broadly shapes the observed phenotypic variation within cell types.

Here, we present an integrated framework leveraging an AI agent that interprets species' habitat connectivity changes along with climate and water co-benefits to select optimal conservation and restoration priorities. We implement this framework through scenarios maximizing biodiversity protection with ecological integrity, carbon storage, and water co-benefits to achieve Canada's 30x30 conservation and restoration targets. Our results suggest that prioritizing the protection of threatened biodiversity and irrecoverable carbon storage would optimally enhance existing Protected Areas outcomes and conserve 30% of lands by 2030. However, effectively restoring 30% of degraded land will require targeted actions in existing natural and transformed ecosystems. The assessment of current anthropogenic pressures suggests that conservation and restoration actions may enhance climate resilience for forestry in natural lands and potentially benefit agricultural production and public health in transformed lands. Moreover, the mining sector represents the largest growing pressure on both conservation and restoration priorities in the upcoming decade. Overall, this integrated framework reveals strategic conservation and restoration priorities to align environmental targets, while identifying opportunities to coordinate NbS interventions across sectors.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

SwiftMHC predicts peptide MHC binding in 0.009 sec/case in batch mode on a single A100 GPU-nearly an order of magnitude faster than leading sequence-based methods such as NetMHCpan 4.1 (0.081 sec/case) while performing competitively in predictive accuracy. In addition to affinity estimation, SwiftMHC generates all atom 3D pMHC structures and achieves a median Ca-RMSD of 1.32 A against Xray benchmarks, matching or better than the accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., AlphaFold with fine-tuning) but running thousands of times faster (excluding disk-writing time). These results demonstrate the power of task-specific AI trained on physics derived synthetic data to overcome the scarcity of experimental structures. Optimized for HLA A*02:01 9mers but readily extensible to other alleles, SwiftMHC enables rapid and accurate identification of peptides distinct from self at Tcell exposed surfaces.

However, the possibility of this recurrent mutation is often ignored, even when it has the potential to introduce errors, such as when assuming co-ancestry through variant sharing for demographic analysis. Even rare variants such as doubletons, which should be particularly informative about recent demography, may have multiple origins despite arising relatively recently in the population. Here, we develop methods first to estimate the frequency of recurrent doubletons in a population genomic dataset from the occurrence of tri-allelic sites with two different singleton mutations, and then to identify a subset of high confidence single origin doubletons based on the presence of a linked rare variant on the surrounding shared haplotype. Applying these methods to data for the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sampled from across Africa, we estimate that up to ~16% of reported doubletons have independent origins. We then identify a set of doubletons likely (~99%) to have a single origin, which consists of ~68% of all the expected single origin doubletons (and ~57% of all observed doubletons). The effectiveness of our approach is queried, and these doubletons are then used to test population genetic hypotheses about recombination, selection, and isolation by distance. The methods developed here should be useful for demographic inference when populations are large enough such that recurrent mutation cannot be ignored.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

We applied this model to study HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, which can persist in tissue reservoirs including in the brain despite viral suppression by antiretroviral therapy. These glia-immune humanized mice supported robust HIV-1 replication in the peripheral blood, lymphoid tissues, and the brain, and recapitulated the synapse loss observed in patients. Furthermore, HIV-infected mice exhibited heightened inflammation in both peripheral and brain tissues. Notably, OPCs and oligodendrocytes in HIV-infected brains adopted an immune activated phenotype, upregulating interferon-stimulated genes, highlighting understudied roles of oligodendroglia in HIV infection. RNA-sequencing of human glia identified the upregulation of inflammasome-associated genes and the downregulation of genes involved in transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic regulation.

DC-dependent systemic spread of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is dependent on expression of a viral G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) homolog, encoded by M33. We performed global transcriptional profiling of murine DCs infected with either wild-type mouse MCMV or a M33 mutant harbouring a single point mutation (R131Q; denoted M33NQY), which ablates constitutive G protein-dependent signalling. RNA-seq analysis revealed that MCMV induces substantial transcriptional reprogramming, with over 2,400 significantly altered genes affecting key immune and migration pathways. Wild-type MCMV infection resulted in 1,883 upregulated and 658 downregulated genes, while M33NQY infection showed comparable effects with 1,905 upregulated and 668 downregulated genes. Both viruses systematically downregulated the MHC class II antigen presentation machinery, with substantial suppression of H2 molecules, peptide-loading components (H2-DMa/H2-DMb1), and the class II transactivator Ciita (log2FC > -6.4). Pathway analysis revealed coordinated disruption of B cell receptor signalling, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and antigen processing and presentation. A comparison between wild-type and M33NQY-infected DCs demonstrated that while both viruses similarly impair antigen presentation, M33 signalling specifically enhances the expression of genes involved in transendothelial migration, including Spp1 (osteopontin, log2FC = 0.65), cytoskeletal components (Actg1, Actb), adhesion molecules (Icam1), and matrix interaction factors (Tnc, Plau). Network analysis identified critical hub genes, including B2m, Itgb1, Itgam, and Icam1, as key regulatory nodes connecting antigen presentation and migration pathways.

Here, using a TDP-43 RNA aptamer and a Stathmin-2 cryptic exon transcript BaseScope(TM) ISH probe, we identify widespread peripheral organ TDP-43 pathology prior to motor symptom onset in a discovery cohort of ante-mortem tissues from people who went on to develop ALS. Peripheral organs exhibiting both TDP-43 toxic gain- and loss-of-function include muscle, lymph node, gallbladder, colon and, with notably high incidence, skin. Given the accessibility of skin as a readily biopsiable tissue, representing a promising substrate for the detection of disease-associated proteinopathies and the development of minimally invasive biomarkers, we established an extended cohort of ante-mortem skin samples for TDP-43 pathology validation and further investigation. In skin biopsies taken during life from 17 individuals who went on to develop ALS we identify TDP-43 pathology from all 17 individuals in a wide distribution of anatomical sites, up to 26.5 years before ALS diagnosis - a presymptomatic period comparable to that observed for skin alpha-synucleinopathy in Parkinson's disease. TDP-43 pathology was most abundant in skin biopsies from the back and shoulder, with sweat and sebaceous glands showing the highest involvement. TDP-43 pathology was also associated with structural changes. As skin alpha-synucleinopathy has been established as a biomarker for both the detection of Parkinson's disease and the differentiation of Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy, we propose that skin TDP-43 likewise holds diagnostic and discrimination potential for diseases characterized by TDP-43 proteinopathy.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Behavioral experiments revealed that observers could categorize style-synthesized versions of natural scene and object images with high accuracy. Furthermore, we recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for the original, SS, and PS images and decoded natural scene and object categories using a support vector machine (SVM). Consistent with the behavioral results, natural scene categories were decoded with high accuracy within 200 ms after the stimulus onset. In contrast, object categories were successfully decoded only from VEPs for original images at later latencies. Finally, we examined whether style features could classify natural scene and object categories. The classification accuracy for natural scene categories showed a similar trend to the behavioral data, whereas that for object categories did not align with the behavioral results.

Nevertheless, it has been proposed that many cells in visuo-oculomotor areas are involved in both motor preparation and covert attention, and consequently their neural signatures should functionally overlap to a large degree. Here, we directly tested this proposal: we combined human (both sexes) EEG with sensitive decoding techniques to investigate whether the neural signatures of preparatory overt and covert attention are dissociable across large-scale neuronal populations. We found that neural decoding reliably discerned whether overt or covert attention was shifted well before saccade initiation. Further, inverted encoding modeling revealed earlier and sharper spatially-tuned activity in preparatory overt than in covert attention. We then asked whether preparatory overt attention achieved sharper spatially-tuned activity by using more-of-the-same covert attention, or by recruiting additional spatially selective neural processing. Cross-decoding results demonstrated that preparatory overt attention recruited at least one additional, frontal process. This additional spatially selective process emerged early and likely reflects motor preparation or predictive remapping. To summarize, we found that the neural signatures of overt and covert attention overlap, yet diverge rapidly, in part because overt attention employs an additional spatially selective neural process. Extending beyond a dissociation on the single-cell level, our findings demonstrate that population-level neural activity dissociates preparatory overt from covert attention.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that, while CML single cell transcriptomes exist along continuous transcriptional microstates, clinically relevant leukemia phenotypes clearly manifest only at the pseudobulk (macrostate) level. By leveraging state-transition theory, we reveal how robust disease phenotype state-transitions are governed by cell type specific contributions. Our results establish a theoretical framework explaining why discrete disease phenotypes remain hidden at the single cell scale but emerge clearly at the aggregated macrostate level, enabling previously inaccessible biological insights into leukemia evolution.

L.", "abstract": "Vici syndrome (VS) is a rare pediatric genetic disorder characterized by profound developmental delay, seizures, immune deficits, cardiomyopathy, and progressive motor dysfunction. This devastating condition is caused by pathogenic variants in the EPG5 gene, which encodes a regulator of autophagy, leading to the accumulation of toxic intracellular material and widespread cellular dysfunction. Pathogenic mutations in EPG5 have also been seen in some rare familial forms of Parkinsons Disease, suggesting deficits in EPG5 function may be causative for a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, there are no effective treatments for neurodegenerative disorders involving deficits in EPG5 function. The underlying cellular mechanisms driving the progressive neurological decline in VS remain poorly understood. Previous studies using Epg5 knockout models have demonstrated severe neurological phenotypes; however these models have not been characterized for molecular and cellular deficits within the central nervous system. We report the generation and analysis of novel genetically engineered mice with mutations in Epg5 as models of VS, including a strain harboring a truncating mutation that recapitulates a patient-derived pathogenic variant and a strain with an Epg5 null allele. These novel Epg5 mutant mouse models exhibited partial perinatal lethality. Neurological deficits of surviving were detectable by six weeks of age, which worsen over time. Histological analysis revealed widespread expansion of microglia and astrocytes throughout the CNS. Transcriptomic profiling of CNS tissue revealed robust neuroinflammatory signatures, sharing molecular profiles with disease-associated microglia observed in other models of neurological disease and injury. The analysis of these novel mouse models of Vici syndrome suggest a critical role for neuroglial activation in the pathogenesis of VS. These novel in vivo models will be an essential platform for preclinical evaluation of therapeutics that target autophagy-related neurodegeneration in congenital disorders of autophagy.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

If local-scale environmental heterogeneity has a similar capacity to generate patterns of adaptation to that found across broad gradients, then we currently underestimate adaptive capacity to global change. We quantified population variation in climate tolerance traits and their plasticity for five populations of Drosophila melanogaster from a 3000-km latitudinal gradient, which we contrasted with eight local populations from an environmentally heterogeneous 600x300km area. Population variation in stress tolerance at the local scale was comparable to that across latitude. Consistent with local adaptation, populations from warmer and drier environments showed greater heat and desiccation tolerance, and populations from more predictable environments showed greater plasticity. Adaptation at smaller geographic scales can therefore contribute more to adaptive capacity than originally thought. However, patterns of adaptation often changed across geography, which makes predicting responses to global change challenging.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Pathogenic chlamydial species restrict their peptidoglycan (PG) to the division septum of their replicative forms. PG is a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) and two of its major pattern recognition receptors in human cells are nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins 1 and 2 (NOD1 and NOD2, respectively). It has been proposed that this unique morphological feature is evidence of pathoadaptation by the microbe, permitting PG-dependent cell division while also reducing the bacterium's recognition by innate immune receptors. Chlamydia trachomatis-infected cells activate NOD1 signaling within 8-12 hours of exposure to the bacterium, roughly coinciding with the microbe?s transition from its infectious to replicative forms. Here we report that, unlike NOD1 signaling, Chlamydia-induced NOD2 signaling does not occur until later in the pathogen's developmental cycle. Both C. trachomatis and the related murine pathogen Chlamydia muridarum signal late in infection in HEK293 reporter cell lines expressing either human or murine-derived NOD2 receptors. NOD2 signaling can be modulated by disruption of the chlamydial amidase enzyme, AmiACT, interrupting the microbe?s developmental cycle, and inducing RB lysis with inhibitors of lipooligosaccharide or peptidoglycan biosynthesis / assembly. These results mirror prior observations with Chlamydia-induced TLR9 signaling, leading us to hypothesize that Chlamydia-induced NOD2 signaling results from RB lytic events that occur sporadically during the RB to EB transition. Given our finding that pre-treating cells with NOD2-stimulatory ligands reduces chlamydial inclusion size, we hypothesize that the microbe preferentially degrades its PG during development to reduce the generation of NOD2 ligands, at the cost of enhancing NOD1 signaling.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Sex in haplodiploids is commonly determined by the alleles present at a complementary sex determination (CSD) locus, with heterozygosity triggering the female developmental pathway. The identity of this locus differs among taxa and is only known in a few species. Here, we map a single CSD locus to a 2 kbp region in the genome of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. It overlaps the long noncoding RNA ANTSR, which has been identified as the sex-determining gene in the invasive ant Linepithema humile. This locus is homozygous in diploid males and exhibits extremely high levels of haplotype diversity, consistent with the action of frequency-dependent selection. The elevated levels of heterozygosity in the CSD locus enable us to fine-map potentially functional genetic variation within it. We also identify elevated levels of genetic diversity in the ortholog of the CSD locus in five other bee and ant genera, suggesting that it may govern sex determination widely in Hymenoptera. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that ANTSR evolved a role in sex determination over 150 million years ago and is the ancestral sex-determination locus of bees and ants.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

R.; Labeit, S.; Moriscot, A. S.", "abstract": "Background: Mechanical inactivity rapidly induces diaphragm muscle fibers contractile dysfunction and atrophy. Diaphragm weakness can impair respiratory function, quality of life, and increase risks of morbidity and mortality. Muscle RING- finger protein-1 (MuRF1) expression is upregulated during denervation and muscle inactivity, and is known to target key muscle proteins for degradation. We previously reported that the small-molecule targeting MuRF1 (MyoMed-205) protects against diaphragm contractile dysfunction and atrophy after 12 hours of unilateral diaphragm denervation (UDD) in rats. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which MyoMed-205 protects the diaphragm structure and function during early UDD in rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to unilateral diaphragm denervation (UDD) for 12 hours. Immediately after UDD, rats received either a placebo (vehicle) or small-molecule targeting MuRF1 (MyoMed-205, 50 mg/kg bw), and outcomes were compared with Sham-operated controls. Diaphragm was used for histological, morphometric, transcriptomic (RNA-seq), and protein content (Western Blot) analysis. Results: UDD induced diaphragm slow- (type I: p = 0.03) and fast-twitch (type IIa: p = 0.04; type IIb/x: p = 0.02) fibers atrophy after 12 hours, which was prevented by MyoMed-205 (p < 0.05). Mechanistically, UDD perturbed mechanisms involved with myofiber ultrastructure and contractility, mitochondrial function, proteolysis, and tissue remodeling in the diaphragm. MyoMed-205 enhanced the activation of mechanisms required for sarcomere integrity, calcium handling, antioxidant defense, chaperone-mediated unfolded protein response, and muscle growth. MyoMed-205 also mitigated intramuscular fat deposition and pro-fibrotic responses triggered by UDD. Conclusion: Small-molecule targeting MuRF1 (MyoMed-205) protects against diaphragm muscle contractile dysfunction and atrophy after 12 hours of UDD. Herein, we demonstrate that this protective effect involved augmented activation of signaling pathways controlling muscle structure and function, chaperone-mediated unfolded protein, and muscle growth, while mitigating intramuscular fat deposition and pro-fibrotic responses triggered by UDD at the transcriptional and/or protein level.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Background: The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) has shown potential as a therapeutic target for several neuropsychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, chronic pain, and substance use disorder. Signaling of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like the KOR is generally thought to change in magnitude, not valence, with behavior states. Here we investigated KOR modulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons following an acute, behaviorally aversive manipulation. Methods: KOR agonist responses were measured with whole cell recordings in acute brain slices containing the VTA from male and female rats. Slices were made <1 hr, 3 days or 5 days after a foot shock or sham session. Slices from untreated rats were used to determine the mechanism of action. Recordings were also made in neurons labeled by the retrograde tracer DiI to evaluate circuit specificity. Place conditioning to intra-VTA KOR agonist injections was performed in sham vs shock rats. Results: After acute stress KOR activation excited a subset of VTA dopamine neurons. In slices from untreated animals, brief corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) exposure ex vivo rapidly induced a similar switch in KOR signaling. This effect was observed specifically in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) projecting VTA neurons, but not in other projections. Behaviorally, foot shock stress produced a loss of conditioned place aversion to intra-VTA KOR activation. Conclusions: After acute aversive stress, KOR activation in the VTA excites, rather than inhibits, dmPFCprojecting VTA dopamine neurons. This change can be generated by activating the CRF system and interferes with the aversiveness of VTA KOR activation.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

This study examined whether negative affectivity (such as depressiveness, anxiety, and stress level), conceptualized as both transient states and stable traits, moderates the effects of tDCS on working memory (WM) and associative memory (AM). We pooled data from six sham-controlled experiments involving 144 healthy young adults (351 tDCS sessions) using within-subject crossover designs. Participants completed WM and AM tasks following active anodal tDCS or sham, as well as Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) before each session. We found that trait-level negative affectivity, but not state-level emotional fluctuations, moderated WM. Individuals with higher levels of depression, anxiety, or stress demonstrated greater tDCS-induced WM gains. In contrast, AM benefits were consistent and unaffected by affective traits or states. These findings indicate that psychological traits can shape the variability of tDCS effects. In particular, negative affectivity influences susceptibility to tDCS effects on cognitively demanding tasks that rely heavily on executive control. This effect may stem from negative affectivity's association with downscaled baseline cortical excitability in prefrontal networks, crucial for WM performance, thereby opening the possibility of greater tDCS-induced improvement. These findings provide further support to our growing understanding of the complex interplay between emotional and cognitive processes in shaping individual responses to tDCS and point out that negative affectivity should be taken into consideration when evaluating individual variability of the tDCS (and other non-invasive brain stimulation techniques) effects on memory and cognition.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate for the first time that clinically relevant doses of image-guided targeted radiotherapy induce metastasis in a genetically engineered KPC mouse model of PDAC. Furthermore, this induction is largely driven by an organotropic switch in lung metastasis. Using an in vitro RNAi screening approach, we identified a key role for myotonic dystrophy-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK) in driving this response. MRCK activity was spatially upregulated at the plasma membrane in response to radiotherapy in PDAC cell lines as well as at the invasive margins of PDAC tumors. This upregulation of activity was maintained in metastases, suggesting an important role for MRCK in not only triggering local invasion in response to radiotherapy but also promoting distant metastases. Importantly, inhibition of MRCK with a small-molecule inhibitor (BDP9066) specifically opposed radiation-driven MRCK upregulation and pro-metastatic response.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Recent work established ARID1A-dependent functions within germinal center (GC) B cells, but its role during early B cell development, and whether its homolog, ARID1B, contributes distinct or compensatory roles at steady state or during transformation, remain unknown. Here, we used CD19-Cre-mediated deletion initiated at the pro-B cell stage to investigate their role in B cell development in vivo. Loss of either gene partially blocked B cell differentiation, reducing immature/recirculating B cell output, and impaired germinal center formation following antigen challenge. Combined deletion further reduced peripheral B cells, shortened survival, and resulted in aggressive leukemia. Unexpectedly, the malignancy was of myeloid origin and arose from a subset of CD19-expressing multipotent progenitors (MPPs).

This approach aims to create a robust coating that enhances corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and the antifouling properties of Al, towards biofilm-forming organisms such as C. albicans, S. aureus, and E. coli. Current study identifies that concentrations, particularly 100 and 250 ug/mL of GO on Al exhibit potent biocidal activity, while preserving aforementioned material properties. Since Al is an infinitely recyclable, green material, this work offers a sustainable alternative to traditional antimicrobial surfaces. Further, this presents a strategy for surface modification of implantable biomedical devices, reducing periprosthetic infection and extending device longevity; as well as for ex vivo applications requiring strong antimicrobial performance.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

D.; Marti, M. A.", "abstract": "Hemoglobin (Hb), a well-characterized protein central to oxygen transport and molecular medicine, serves as a model for studying how sequence variations influence protein structure and function. Its precise activity depends on tightly regulated structural dynamics, which can be disrupted by mutations that give rise to structural hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease, unstable hemoglobins, methemoglobins, and hemoglobins with altered oxygen affinity, each associated with distinct functional and clinical consequences.Among genetic variants, missense mutations are the most widely studied in clinical settings. Accurately predicting their clinical impact remains challenging, requiring integration of evolutionary, biochemical, and structural data. While broad deep learning models like AlphaMissense show promise, they often lack interpretability and protein-specific precision. This motivates the development of focused models that leverage detailed knowledge of individual proteins, like hemoglobin, to improve both predictive power and mechanistic understanding. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of all known and potential human adult hemoglobin (HbA) variants, guided by the hypothesis that a deep understanding of the sequence-structure-function relationship in Hb can yield interpretable and predictive insights into the functional and clinical consequences of single amino acid substitutions. We curated an updated dataset of HbA variants annotated with their clinical classifications, Benign, Pathogenic, or of Uncertain Significance (VUS), and systematically mapped each to a range of features, including structural location and classification, predicted impact on folding stability, and evolutionary conservation. Using this data, we developed a pathogenicity prediction model and benchmarked it against AlphaMissense, demonstrating strong and complementary performance. Additionally, we generated a complete mutational landscape of all possible single amino acid substitutions (SAS) in HbA, providing a resource for future clinical interpretation. Our findings provide insight into the molecular basis for variant effects in HbA and highlight the utility of combining structure-informed features with Machine Learning (ML) for variant interpretation. Moreover, our results offer a framework for evaluating the portability and interpretability of variant effect predictors across structurally dynamic systems, with implications in the improvement of variant classification in other protein families.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

However, environmental perturbations can be subtle, and the associated biological effects could be masked by experimental noise and bioinformatic processing, especially when the samples are generated separately. Multiplexing strategies have been developed to label each sample and process them together to reduce experimental noise, but existing multiplexing methods often fall short for non-human and non-mouse models in established single-cell RNA sequencing protocols like the BD Rhapsody technology. To address this gap, we combined Lipid Modified Oligonucleotide (LMO) cell tagging with the BD Rhapsody platform to achieve efficient and scalable multiplexing of early embryonic chick cells under different environmental conditions. This species-agnostic LMO approach overcomes limitations of antibody-based multiplexing methods that are often restricted to human and mouse systems, and the only multiplexing option available with the BD Rhapsody system. In our study, we successfully compartmentalized and multiplexed chick embryonic cells under different treatment conditions, analyzing up to 40,000 viable cells per experiment. This strategy minimized experimental noise, eliminating the need for bioinformatics-based batch correction. As a result, we were able to achieve high-quality transcriptomic profiling with minimal loss of critical biological information and identified subtle biological differences that were masked when using data integration pipelines. Our workflow provides an adaptable, robust solution for LMO-tagged single-cell analyses of complex non-human models with the BD Rhapsody technology and opens new avenues for developmental biology research by accurately capturing treatment-induced effects in embryonic tissues.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

W.; Lu, T.; Bhatti, S.; Kouba, P.; Huang, P.-S.", "abstract": "Structure-conditioned sequence design models aim to design a protein sequence that will fold into a given target structure. Deep-learning-based approaches for sequence design have proven highly successful for various protein design applications, but many non-idealized backbones still remain out of reach for current models under typical in silico success criteria. We hypothesize that training objectives prioritizing native sequence recovery unintentionally push models to reproduce non-structural signals (e.g. phylogenetic relatedness, neutral drift, or dataset sampling biases), rather than a broadly generalizable structure-sequence mapping. Inspired by recent work bridging sequence likelihood and fitness prediction in protein language models, we introduce Caliby, a Potts model-based sequence design method capable of conditioning on an ensemble of structures. Conditioning on a synthetic ensemble generated from an input backbone allows sampling of sequences consistent with the structural constraints of the ensemble while averaging out undesired biases towards the native sequence. Ensemble-conditioned sequence design with Caliby reduces native sequence recovery while substantially improving AlphaFold2 self-consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art models ProteinMPNN and ChromaDesign on both native and de novo backbones. Finally, we train a variant of Caliby on only soluble proteins and demonstrate in silico that Protpardelle-1c binder designs that were previously deemed undesignable by SolubleMPNN are actually designable under SolubleCaliby, highlighting limitations of existing filtering pipelines.

In fact, a single NRPS gene can already exceed the size limits of standard cloning vectors. In this study, we establish split inteins as a novel tool for NRPS engineering to enable the expression of single, covalently linked NRPS proteins from multiple plasmids and to perform cloning-free module swapping.

A complex interplay between environmental factors and a multitude of genetic determinants, most of them composed of low-risk variants, impose difficulties in understanding the molecular and cellular underpinnings of these conditions. In some cases, autistic patients have been shown to display alterations in splicing patterns of several genes, but the extent to which this phenomenon is common in the context of these multifactorial disorders is unknown, nor is it known if monogenic cases of autism also display dysregulation of splicing. Moreover, very few studies have investigated the causal links between splicing alterations in specific genes and the phenotypic characteristics of the neural tissue in autism patients. In this study, we have focused on a monogenic type of autism caused by haploinsufficiency of the Transcription Factor 4 gene, known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome. We show that neurons and organoids derived from patients with this disease have altered expression of splicing regulators in the NOVA and RBFOX families, accompanied by aberrant splicing patterns in a substantial number of genes involved in neural tissue development and synapse organization. We focused on a gene encoding a member of the Neurexin Family, the splicing of which normally leads to the production of transcript variants coding for both transmembrane and secreted protein isoforms. In Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome neurons, we detected an aberrant splicing pattern that results in lower expression of the transcript that encodes the secreted isoform, a phenomenon that may explain why the neural tissue in these patients have decreased electrical activity through impaired synapse organization.

In both animals and humans, dysfunction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) contributes to stress-impaired extinction, but the neural circuit by which stress modulates vmPFC function is not known. We hypothesize that locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine undermines extinction learning by recruiting projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to vmPFC. Using a combination of circuit-specific chemogenetics and calcium imaging, we find that activation of LC noradrenergic neurons mimics a behavioral stressor (footshock), induces freezing behavior, reduces spontaneous neuronal activity in the vmPFC, impairs extinction learning, and alters the population dynamics of vmPFC ensembles. Activation of LC also increases shock-induced responses in BLA neurons that project to vmPFC. Selective chemogenetic activation of LCBLA projections impairs extinction; propranolol infusions into the BLA mitigate the effects of LC activation. Together, these results indicate that the BLA serves as a critical interface between the LC and mPFC to mediate stress-induced extinction impairments.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

We investigated the IC-PL circuit in a social affective preference (SAP) test in which subject rats are exposed to 2 age-matched conspecifics where one is stressed via footshock and the other is naive to stress. Typically, rats approach stressed juvenile conspecifics but avoid stressed adults. Using a combination of local and tract specific loss of function methods, we demonstrate that the PL, anterior IC, and the tracts between the posterior or anterior IC and the PL are necessary when rats face the choice to approach or avoid stressed conspecifics. Going further, chemogenetic inhibition of PL neurons innervated by the IC also interfered with social affective behaviors.

The understanding of how morphogens can be used to guide patterning and differentiation has matured rapidly, however, the influence of basal media components on organoid development remains unclear. Standard organoid media frequently contain non-physiological concentrations of nutrients, including glucose, a central regulator of cellular metabolism and signaling. Here, we examine how glucose availability shapes cerebral organoid growth, morphology, and cell-type composition by comparing conventional hyperglycemic media to media with glucose levels more closely resembling physiological conditions. We find that organoids derived from multiple human pluripotent stem cell lines can grow in physiological glucose, but exhibit altered growth rates, structural features, and lineage distributions. In H9 embryonic stem cell-derived organoids, inhibition of the mTOR pathway under physiological glucose restores neurodevelopmental cell types otherwise diminished in these conditions. These findings highlight glucose as a key determinant of organoid lineage specification and cellular signaling.

A.; Iulianella, A.", "abstract": "The mammalian hippocampus derives from the cortical hem region of the forebrain and is one of the two regions in the mammalian forebrain that contains neural progenitors capable of generating new neurons in the postnatal brain. Hippocampal neural stem cells, referred to as type I progenitors, are Sox2+/GFAP+, localize along the hilar boundary region, and possess a radial glia fiber that spans the thickness of the dentate gurus. The hilar boundary region serves as a niche for the neural progenitor pool, controlling the activation of type-1 progenitors to transit amplifying type-2 neural progenitors which lose their apical adherence to the hilus as they differentiate to granule cells. The genetic regulation of this process is not fully understood and requires factors that control the mobilization of type-1 cells from their hilar niche in the subgranular zone. To that end we now report a role for Mllt11 (Af1q/Tcf7c; Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to chromosome 11/All1 Fused Gene from Chromosome 1q/T cell factor 7 co-factor), a regulator of neurite formation and migration in the cortex, in the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis by restricting the transition of type-1 cells to transit amplifiers and neuroblasts. We previously showed that Cux2 (Cutl2) is widely expressed in the developing hippocampus, initially in the subventricular zone of the cortical hem, which generates the dentate gyrus, then in both type-1 and type-2 neural progenitors, and later in maturing granule cells of the perinatal hippocampus. To evaluate a role for Mllt11 in hippocampal neurogenesis, we used a Cux2IRESCre/+ line to generate a Mllt11 loss-of-function in perinatal hippocampal progenitors and differentiating granule cells. The loss of Mllt11 led to enlarged dentate blades dues to increased generation of NeuN+ and Calbindin+ granule cells. Explorations of the progenitor pool revealed increased transit amplifying cells due to an expanded pool of displaced Sox2+/GFAP+ deep in the dentate blades, with altered radial glial morphology. Consequently, type-1 progenitors aberrantly transitioned to amplifying progenitors and neuroblasts, resulting in enhanced granule cell neurogenesis in the postnatal hippocampus. Primary neurosphere formation assays confirmed enhanced proliferation of neural stem cells derived from Mllt11 knockout hippocampi. Taken together, the findings reported here demonstrate the critical role of Mllt11 in maintaining the hippocampal radial glial phenotype and their association within the subgranular zone-hilar niche boundary region, thereby controlling their differentiation to transit amplifiers and granule cells.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Many existing methods use prior knowledge or heuristic selection rules, such as selecting highly variable genes, which overlook gene-gene correlations and may consequently result in suboptimal coverage. To address the limitations of the existing methods, we introduce scGPD, a deep learning-based framework for gene panel design that leverages single-cell RNA-seq data to identify compact, nonredundant sets of genes for spatial profiling. scGPD uses a gene-gene correlation-aware gating mechanism to extract informative features from data, encouraging diversity among selected genes and eliminating redundancy. Across diverse single-cell datasets, scGPD outperforms existing gene panel design methods in recovering transcriptome-wide expression using a limited number of genes. When applied to spatial transcriptomics data, it achieves superior cell type classification accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization across modalities. The gene panels selected by scGPD further exhibit well-defined spatial expression patterns, highlighting their robustness and relevance for spatial analysis. The scGPD framework is flexible and can be adapted to multiple use cases, enabling the prioritization of genes relevant to specific diseases or phenotypes.

In this regard, investigators have focused on the effects of minor cannabinoid activation / desensitization of peripheral sensory neurons on nociceptive signaling and/or peripheral inflammation. With a focus on peripheral nociception, four common minor cannabinoids: cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabichromene (CBC) were studied in primary cultures of mouse Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons. We queried if calcium responses induced by the four cannabinoids differed in potency of activation, neuronal size preference, and dose-response relationships. Additionally, we determined the dependence of CBD and CBN on key channel-receptors that are known to mediate pain and/or antinociception. Individually, CBD, CBG and CBC directed greater response magnitudes when compared to CBN. All four minor cannabinoids activated overlapping but distinct size populations of sensory neurons. CBD and CBG activated the widest range of DRG neuron sizes (smaller-larger) overlapping with smaller capsaicin-sensitive neurons. In contrast, CBN and CBC activated predominantly larger sensory neurons. CBD diverged from other minor cannabinoids in directing a linear dose-response profile whereas CBG and CBC directed sigmoidal dose-response profiles and CBN activated DRG neurons with an inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship. CBD-induced activation of DRG neurons was dependent on co-expression of the nociceptive channel TRPV1 plus cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R), whereas CBN-induced activation was independent of TRPV1. Overall, we observed that minor cannabinoids CBD, CBG, CBN and CBC differed in their activation of DRG neurons and directed unique activation properties across a diverse population of sensory neurons. Such differences underly the hypothesis that a combination (entourage) of complimentary minor cannabinoids can direct synergistic antinociceptive activity", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

E.; Yang, Z.; Griffiss, M.", "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the immunogenicity of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) based gonococcal vaccines, we developed a multiplexed fluorescent microsphere immunoassay that distinguishes and quantifies antibodies that bind the various LOS antigens. Methods: We coupled LOS from gonococcal strains 1291wt (nLc4  chain), 1291a (Lc3  chain) and 1291c (Lc2  chain), to different fluorescent microsphere regions (BioRad) after disaggregation in 1% deoxycholate. The microspheres were incubated with sera from 37 participants in a study of gonococcal risk factors. Laser excited fluorescence from each region was converted to ng/mL of IgG with use of affinity purified human IgG specific for each LOS. IgG specific to the nLc4 terminal galactose was quantified by subtraction of Lc3 IgG from 1291wt IgG; that specific to the Lc3 terminal glucosamine by subtraction of Lc2 IgG from Lc3 IgG. Results: Concentrations of nLc4, Lc3 and Lc2 IgG summed to the concentration of 1291wt IgG. Visual inspection of the data revealed a non-normally distributed, bimodal distribution of nLc4 IgG concentrations; 31/37 had a mean serum nLc4 IgG concentration of 6.22 ng/mL, and the other six had a mean nLc4 IgG concentration of 11.2 ng/ml. Upon statistical comparison of these groups, conducted prior to knowledge of infection status, those participants whose nLc4 IgG concentration centered around a higher mean, were more likely to be asymptomatic (p = 0.03) and were less likely to be infected (p = 0.05) than those with lower IgG concentrations. Conclusions: This accurate LOS immunoassay can be expanded to include any number of LOS specificities.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Although they possess a latent capacity to generate oligodendrocytes, these cells predominantly differentiate into astrocytes after injury. The molecular cues that govern their lineage commitment toward astrocytic versus oligodendroglial fates remain poorly defined. In this study, we addressed this gap in vitro by investigating the emergence of PDGFRA oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in neurosphere cultures derived from adult spinal cord stem cells. We first observed that neurosphere cells exhibited a hybrid identity, co-expressing transcription factors of both astrocytic (NFIA, SOX9) and oligodendrocytic (OLIG1/2, SOX4, NKX2.2, TCF4) lineages. Upon differentiation, oligodendrocytic transcription factors were selectively maintained in OPCs but reduced in other cells. Using PdgfraH2B-GFP mice, we then isolated newly formed PDGFRA OPCs from neurospheres and performed multi-omic profiling. OPC formation was associated with the upregulation of chromatin remodelers and the downregulation of stem-cell markers such as EGFR, HES1, and TNC. Strikingly, OPC specification coincided with reduced expression of YAP1 and its partner TEAD1, key effectors of the Hippo pathway. Functional analyses revealed that YAP1 loss enhanced oligodendrocytic differentiation while reducing astrocytic and ependymal/cilia-associated gene expression. Conversely, constitutive YAP1 activation blocked differentiation into both lineages and promoted an ependymal-like transcriptional program, including upregulation of the ependymal marker CD24a and cilia-related proteins such as CROCC (Rootletin). Collectively, these findings uncover previously unrecognized roles for YAP1 in adult spinal cord stem-cell fate decisions and provide a molecular framework for leveraging these cells in regenerative strategies targeting spinal cord repair.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

This issue calls for approaches that support decisions on conservation prioritization, such as species phylogenetic relationships or diversity and endemism metrics. However, these traditional approaches often neglect some important aspects, limiting their effectiveness. We used desiccation-tolerant vascular plants (DT plants) to investigate the effectiveness of such approaches to prioritize species and areas for conservation. We used climate data and modeled the distribution of all DT plants recognized to date to evaluate if species phylogenetic relationships can depict similarities in species sensitivity and exposure to climate change, and to evaluate if centers of diversity and endemism for DT plants can indicate regions prone to climate change. We found that the species phylogenetic relationships weakly explains species sensitivity to climate change, although it can, to some extent, describe trends in species exposure to climate change. We also found that centers of diversity and endemism for DT plants are not necessarily the most prone ones to climate change. We suggest a limited effectiveness of phylogenetic relationships and of diversity and endemism metrics for conservation prioritization, once these approaches might overlook vulnerable species and regions exposed to climate change. We discuss that a better understanding of the mechanisms of diversity would help to identify situations in which closely related species show lower ecological differences than distantly related species, when phylogenetic relationships is a more relevant approach in a conservation context. We also suggest that more efficient conservation strategies in centers of diversity and endemism of DT plants should focus on species sensitivity and adaptive capacity to climate change, rather than the magnitude of climate change.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

However, to reconstruct high-quality images, vis-OCT requires special post-processing, including balanced detection. An open-source, standardized vis-OCT data processing software is essential for clinical applications and translation of vis-OCT. Methods: We developed Vis-OCT Explorer, an open-source, modular Python-based software for processing vis-OCT images. In addition to the standard spectral-domain OCT processing pipeline, including k-space resampling, dispersion compensation, and fast Fourier transformation, Vis-OCT Explorer offers unique dual-spectrometer balanced detection, short-time-Fourier transformation (STFT) based dispersion compensation coefficient optimization, and GPU-accelerated processing. We evaluated the reconstruction performance by quantifying a quality index extracted from individual B-scan images. We also assessed the repeatability of retinal thickness measurements by five operators on images acquired from different testing sites using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis. Results: Balanced detection and STFT-based dispersion compensation significantly increased the quality index of reconstructed B-scan images. ICC values of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness measurements from four testing sites exceeded 0.8 in 87.5% of the macular-centered images. The ICC of RNFL thickness measurements on all optic nerve head-centered images is above 0.8, showing strong repeatability across users.

N-glycosylation is a key post-translational modification influencing the biological activity of many protein-based therapeutics, yet structure-function relationships of N-glycans remain poorly understood due to challenges in producing homogeneous glycoforms. Current go-to production hosts, mammalian and yeast cells, often yield heterogeneous glycan profiles and require extensive genetic manipulation. Alternative production hosts such as the plant Nicotiana benthamiana, provide more homogeneous glycosylation and flexibility through transient expression, but are limited in the generation of certain glycoforms. In vitro glycoengineering can overcome these limitations but is time consuming and requires expensive resources. In this study, we show that by combining in planta and in vitro glycoengineering strategies, we can quickly produce a wide range of homogeneous glycoforms of pharmaceutical proteins with high mannose, paucimannose, hybrid and complex N-glycan structures. Using N. benthamiana as a transient expression host, we produced two pharmaceutical glycoproteins - the monoclonal antibody rituximab and the helminth vaccine candidate OoASP-1 - and modified them in vitro using Escherichia coli produced glycoenzymes. The combination of these two glycoengineering systems minimizes the amount of time and resources required, while maintaining high glycan homogeneity.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central to cellular signalling and represent one of the largest classes of therapeutic targets, yet their functional modulation remains challenging. Here, we present RareFoldGPCR (RFG), a GPCR-specialised AI model for structure prediction and design that supports NCAAs. By applying transfer learning on high-resolution GPCR structures, RFG accurately models and rationally designs both linear and cyclic peptides that incorporate NCAAs and modulate GPCR activity. This is achieved without the model ever being trained on NCAA-based GPCR modulators. We showcase the capability of RFG by designing peptide agonists for the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and validating their functional activity experimentally in cell-based assays. We investigate the precise capabilities of generating active agonists by expanding different regions of the native GLP-1 hormone, and further demonstrate the design of cyclic peptide agonists with entirely novel sequences and topologies, creating new agonist modes. We analyse how design metrics relate to pathway specificity, enabling precise modulation of pathway activity, such as activating the cAMP response without recruiting {beta}-arrestin to reduce receptor desensitisation.

To quantify how this subtle chemical change leads to profound functional compromise, we used an advanced molecular dynamics framework guided by Variational Autoencoder to unravel GccF's complex dynamics.

Here we present a secondary-structure-based framework to annotate and detect RNA triple helices. First, we extend the dot-bracket formalism with a third annotation line that encodes Hoogsteen contacts. Second, we introduce TripleMatcher, which searches for a tripl-helix pattern, filters candidates by C1'-C1' distance thresholds, and merges overlaps into region-level zones. Using telomerase RNAs and RNA-stability elements with experimentally established triple helices (8 RNAs), TripleMatcher localized all annotated regions (structure-wise detection 8/8); geometric filtering removed most spurious candidates and improved precision (PPV from 0.42 to 0.81) and overall accuracy (F_1 from 0.42 to 0.62) while maintaining sensitivity. Benchmarking eight predictors showed that pseudoknot-aware methods most reliably reproduce the local architecture required for detection, aligning secondary-structure quality with downstream triple-helix recovery. Applied prospectively, the framework identified candidate regions directly from predicted secondary structures and scaled to a screen of 4,147 RNAs, where distance filtering reduced 150,948 raw candidates to 90 geometrically feasible regions across seven molecules, including human telomerase complexes.

First, using gastric epithelial biopsies, BRCA2 carriers were found to harbor higher expression of the proliferative marker Ki-67 within the antral gastric epithelium and strikingly, biopsies from both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers displayed a marked increase in double-stranded DNA damage. These results were further explored using PDGOs, where a growth advantage was observed for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 PDGOs compared to non-carrier PDGOs. Furthermore, both BRCA1 and BRCA2 PDGOs displayed a more pronounced enhancement of Ki-67 expression as well as increased double stranded DNA damage compared to non-carrier PDGOs. Importantly, none of the PDGOs showed signs of BRCA1 or BRCA2 loss of heterozygosity, potentially indicating a haploinsufficient phenotype.

In Systems Biology, dynamical systems provide a foundation for modeling and predicting the intricate behaviors of biological systems. Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), have enabled the development of models that are either fully or partially data-driven. Integrating data-driven components into dynamical systems amplifies the challenge of generalization beyond training data, highlighting the need for robust methods to quantify uncertainty in scenarios not encountered during training. In this work, we investigate the reliability of uncertainty quantification (UQ) based on ensembles of models in the reconstruction of dynamical systems. We show that standard ensembles (i.e., models trained independently with different random initializations) risk producing overconfident predictions in previously unseen scenarios, as the models in the ensemble tend to exhibit similar behaviors. To address this issue, we propose a novel ensemble construction method for NODEs and UDEs that fosters diversity in the reconstructed vector field across models within specific regions of the state space, while maintaining explicit control over the fit on the training set. We evaluate our method on synthetic test cases derived from three models commonly used as benchmarks for data-driven reconstruction of dynamical systems: the Lotka-Volterra model, the damped harmonic oscillator, and the Lorenz system.

These could adopt beads-on-string conformation effectively promoting assembly of diverse enzymes aiding swift degradation of host cell wall. Both animal pathogen secretory proteins and intracellular plant pathogen effectors show enrichment for strong polyampholytes, potentially aiding phase-separation and organizing intracellular biological matter to hijack or suppress host machinery.

This study investigated the hypothesis that Ang II increases T cell activation, as indicated by altered cytokine secretion and expression of surface markers associated with activation. To test this, 11-week-old C57Bl/6J male mice received saline vehicle or Ang II (490 ng/kg/min) via osmotic pump for 14 days (n=10/group) followed by immune cell isolation and ex vivo activation. Splenic T cells from Ang II-infused mice had modestly increased expression of CD25 (CD4: p=0.024, CD8: p=0.007), CD69 (CD4: p=0.017, CD8: p=0.032), and CD137 (CD8: p=0.022) 24 hours post-activation, as measured by median fluorescent intensity. The increased expression of activation markers correlated with an increase in select cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-28B (IFN{lambda}3) and interferon (IFN)-{gamma}-induced protein 10 (IP-10) at 24 hours and IFN{gamma} and IP-10 at 120 hours, while decreasing IL-23 at 120 hours. The increased expression of CD25 and CD69 suggests Ang II may increase the magnitude of T cell activation.

L.", "abstract": "Nuclear speckles have long been recognized as RNA-rich nuclear bodies, yet their role in genome organization and gene regulation remains incompletely understood. Using a rapid dTAG-mediated degradation system to simultaneously deplete SON and SRRM2, the core structural components of nuclear speckles, we identify a novel class of genomic regions, which we term SWING domains. Upon speckle disruption, SWING domains relocate to the nuclear periphery and acquire repressive histone marks such as H3K9me3, accompanied by transcriptional downregulation, particularly of genes involved in developmental pathways. Notably, human mutations in SON and SRRM2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability and global developmental delay. Patient-derived cells bearing such mutations similarly exhibit SWING-domain relocalization and gene repression, underlining a role for speckles in developmental gene regulation. We also report that previously discovered drug-induced speckle rejuvenation can partially rescue aberrant SWING-domain localization to the nuclear lamina and the associated transcriptome in patient-derived cells. These findings establish nuclear speckles as key organizers of active chromatin, functioning in opposition to repressive compartments like the nuclear lamina. Our work reveals a mechanism for how nuclear bodies contribute to 3D genome organization and highlights the importance of nuclear speckles in developmental regulation, providing potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Slightly jittering stimulation pulses (called \"dithering\") was previously proposed on the basis of mathematical modelling to selectively entrain a target neural rhythm while avoiding harmonic entrainment. In this study, we investigated the potential of dithering in humans. Using photic stimulation (light flicker) and EEG recordings in healthy participants, we showed that dithering suppresses half-harmonic synchronisation relative to perfectly periodic flicker, and more so than synchronisation at the stimulation frequency. This was also the case for a periodic condition with reduced stimulation amplitude, as predicted by theory. Furthermore, we demonstrated using synthetic data and modelling that the half-harmonic responses observed in participants cannot be explained by the superposition of evoked responses (even when modulated at the half-harmonic frequency), and are better matched by a minimal oscillator model. Our findings are consistent with half-harmonic EEG synchronisation in response to photic stimulation predominantly reflecting half-harmonic entrainment rather than the summation of evoked responses, and with dithering being an effective strategy to suppress subharmonic entrainment.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

The role of these junctions in early cell-state changes as cells form clusters is unclear. Here, we uncover that the formation of cadherin junctions as cells cluster drives a ubiquitous metabolic reprogramming. This reprogramming enhances the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and NADPH production to augment a reductive state. Consequently, cell clusters stabilized by cadherin junctions have reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), are resistant to exogenous ROS-inducing agents, and have reduced apoptotic markers. Mechanistically, this metabolic reprogramming is driven by the cadherin-dependent activation of NRF2. Blocking the cadherin junction-dependent metabolic program reverses clustered cells to resemble the solitary cell state, increasing cell death and enhancing sensitivity to exogenous ROS. These insights suggest a biochemical basis for adherens junctions mediating a reductive metabolic program as solitary cells form clusters, with implications for understanding multicellular organization and collective cell behavior.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Using published growth data from human colon carcinoma (HCC1), mouse colon carcinoma (MCC26), V79 fibroblasts, and EMT6-Ro spheroids, we demonstrate that the model accurately reproduces observed growth kinetics across multiple phases. Importantly, the model predicts viable rim thickness and oxygen distribution over time, in agreement with theoretical expectations.

In this study the effect of empagliflozin (EM) on sympatho-excitation and potential neurogenic mechanism for EM`s therapeutic effects on cardiac remodeling were studied. Methods: Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt and high-salt (8%) diet (HSD) mouse models were utilized. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to explore the mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardiac remodeling in hypertension. Meanwhile, blood samples were collected from hospitalized patients diagnosed with heart failure to verify the results of animal studies. Results: In DOCA-salt or HSD treated mice, EM was associated with a protective, blood pressure-independent effect on cardiac remodeling. Both DOCA-salt and HSD induced sympatho-excitation, together with neuronal hyper-activity in the pre-autonomic regions of brain, and these were blunted in mice with EM co-treatment. Additionally, single-nucleus RNA sequencing using hypothalami indicated that cellular interplays among the vessels, microglia and inhibitory neurons were involved in the disease- and EM-associated actions. Further analysis of microglia pinpointed a close involvement of peripheral immune activation in disease-associated state transformation of microglia, during DOCA-salt or HSD treatment, including increased lymphocytes count and plasma level of interferon-{gamma}. Differentially expressed genes in neurons highlighted that EM abolished disease-associated upregulation of protein ubiquitination, which might support imbalance of presympathetic excitatory/inhibitory tones, and vasopressin production. In patients` blood samples, EM was associated with significant elevation of hematocrit value in all groups, and reduction of lymphocytes counts in the patients with high NT-proBNP value (> 2550 pg/mL, no diuretic co-treatment). Conclusions: Our data provide a neuro-immune pathway by which EM blunts disease-associated cardiac sympathetic tone and hypertrophic remodeling.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

By systematically dissecting one such genomic locus, the COL1A1-SGCA locus, we identified redundant NS-targeting cis regulatory elements, including a ~600 bp fragment with 17 binding motifs for 8 transcription factors (TFs). Four NS-targeting TFs within this fragment contain acidic activation domains (AADs) that provide both chromatin-context and transcription-dependent NS-targeting, a property that appears common among several other tested AADs.

T.; Sawant, M.; Kang, M.; Xie, L.; Thiam, H. R.", "abstract": "Primarily studied for its role in gene expression, chromatin organization is emerging as an important regulator of nuclear mechanics. Although the nucleus is in mechanical equilibrium with the cell, we do not know whether and how chromatin reorganization actively regulates the mechanical properties and downstream behaviors of cells. Here, we tested the hypothesis that as a dynamic crosslinked polymer, chromatin directly impacts cell mechanics independently of transcription by studying NETosis: a transcription-independent process where chromatin decompacts and the plasma membrane (PM) ruptures. Using high resolution microscopy and ATAC-see, we found that chromatin accessibility progressively increases during NETosis suggesting that chromatin binding proteins (CBPs) dissociate from chromatin during NETosis. To determine the identity and dynamics of these dissociated CBPs, we used fluorescent-recovery after photobleaching to measure the mobility and localization of the linker histone H1, the nucleosomal histone H3 and the heterochromatin binding protein HP1. We found that the mobile fraction of nuclear H1 increases during NETosis while fractions of HP1 and H3 diffuse outside of the nucleus suggesting that they become cytosolic osmolytes and potentially alter the mechanical state of cells. Consistently, we found that plasma membrane tension and cell volume increase as chromatin decompacts during NETosis. In non-NETing U2OS cells, we found that inducing chromatin decompaction increases plasma membrane tension, independently of the cytoskeleton, indicating a causal relationship between chromatin organization, cell volume and plasma membrane tension. Our findings reveal a novel non-genetic role of chromatin in cellular biophysics: regulating cell volume, PM tension, and thus, overall cell mechanics.

Here, we identify the X-linked lncRNA XACT, abundantly but transiently expressed during early human embryogenesis, as a critical regulator of pluripotency, lineage specification, and cancer-like states. In human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), XACT overexpression--but not depletion-sustains self--renewal without exogenous factors and prevents lineage commitment. Mechanistically, XACT upregulation drives hyper-elevation of the core pluripotency factors OCT4 and NANOG at the protein level by repressing their 3' UTR; untranslated regions (UTRs). XACT overexpression confers context-dependent states: in standard hPSC medium it promotes a naive-like program, whereas in the absence of exogenous factors it drives transcriptomic states resembling testicular germ cell tumors, linking misregulation of a developmentally restricted lncRNA to tumorigenic potential. In hPSC-based models of post-implantation development, XACT expression normally declines, whereas its sustained expression disrupts embryonic progression, while depletion has little effect. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of post-implantation human embryos showed that XACT levels correlate positively with pluripotency-associated gene networks. Together, these findings establish XACT as a potent, human-specific modulator of pluripotency and early embryogenesis, and suggest that its aberrant upregulation may underlie both developmental failure and germ cell tumorigenesis.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

They facilitate the regulation of viral RNA (vRNA) turnover by recognizing and forming complexes with the vRNA structure via specific RNA motifs-RNA binding domain interaction. However, due to consistent evolving nature of viruses, silent mutations in the viral genome can impact RBP-vRNA binding thereby altering the RNA processing. While efforts have been made in characterizing other forms of mutations leading to changes in amino acid sequences in SARS-CoV-2 variants, details on how silent mutations impact RBP-vRNA interaction remain limited. Here, we use extensive in silico mutagenesis to introduce silent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to generate four different synthetic variants and map the interaction of the variants and the wild-type with a catalogue of human RBPs. Our result shows variation in accumulation and reduction of the RBPs binding motifs in the variants compared to the virus reference sequence on a global scale and at the UTRs. The majority of the RBPs with AU-rich binding motifs are reduced in the variants, while RBPs with mostly GC-rich motifs accumulate more binding positions, suggesting that a single change from U/A to G/C and vice versa can impact RBP-viral interactions. Furthermore, we use structural analysis to show the interaction of the vRNA with PUF60 and KHDRBS3 proteins, two RBPs that have not been previously implicated in SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Our findings show that loss to the conserved poly(U) in PUF60 binding motifs in some of the variants affects its interaction with the protein at the 5' end, which may disrupt the function of the protein as an anti-viral RNA regulator. We also predicted the key residues in KHDRBS3 interacting with its binding motif in the wild-type at the 3' end, while noting that the vRNA structural changes in the variants may contribute to the loss of this interaction. Overall, our predictions contribute to the insights into virus evolution and pathogenicity of potential new variants due to the impact of synonymous changes in the nucleotide sequences on protein-RNA interaction.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Although bacteria lack meiotic recombination, HR extensively shapes their genomes. However, the mechanisms and ecological conditions sustaining frequent HR in bacteria remain unclear. Using Escherichia coli, we reveal how frequent recombination emerges from herd immunity to a generalized transducing phage. Herd immunity-established here via CRISPR immunity-maintains genetic polymorphism and enables stable host-phage coexistence, thereby promoting genome-wide gene flow and accelerating adaptation through recombination up to two orders of magnitude relative to de novo mutations. Notably, we show that recombination occurs in stationary phase and is mediated by RecG, which has been previously reported to be regulated by the stringent response - a bacterial reaction to nutrient deprivation and other stress conditions. Bacterial herd immunity thus fulfills an unexpected role of promoting adaptation by HR. This mechanism helps explain the enigmatic high rates of HR across bacterial populations, clarifies how bacteria adapt as resources wane, and suggests a broader evolutionary role for bacterial immune systems beyond individual defense.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Although mediators such as Interleukin-6 have been implicated, how these signals impair host organ function remains incompletely defined. Here, we identify a cytokine-lipid axis that drives hepatic autophagy dysfunction. Specifically, in Drosophila, the gut tumor-derived interleukin-like cytokine Upd3 induces the expression of the triglyceride lipase CG5966, which we named cancer-associated lipid mobilizer (calm), and the ceramide synthase schlank in the fat body/liver, which rewires fat body lipid metabolism resulting in an autophagic-flux blockade. Genetic reduction of either CG5966 or schlank restores organelle homeostasis and mitigates paraneoplastic phenotypes. This mechanism is conserved in mammals: in mice, IL-6 upregulates the lipoprotein lipase Lpl and ceramide synthases which in turn trigger a hepatic autophagy-flux blockade; in humans, hepatic LPL and ceramide synthases expression correlates with poorer survival in hepatocellular carcinoma. Our findings position hepatic lipid metabolism rewiring, especially ceramide synthesis as a critical, conserved node coupling systemic inflammation to organelle dysfunction, and suggest this pathway as a possible therapeutic entry point for cancer-associated liver disorders.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we introduce EWF 2.0, an exact simulation algorithm that accommodates time-varying demography within Wright-Fisher diffusions whilst retaining all the functionality of previous EWF versions. This extension is particularly valuable for bridge simulation, where existing methods cannot handle differing mutation and selection rates. For a specified demographic history, mutation parameters, selection function and sampling times, EWF 2.0 generates exact draws from the law of the corresponding Wright--Fisher diffusion or diffusion bridge. We validate correctness using distributional tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, QQ plots), confirming agreement with theoretical expectations.

PROTAC-induced degradation of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) early in the transition weakens PE connectivity, while inhibition of its H3K27 methyltransferase activity does not, suggesting a non-catalytic role of Polycomb in supporting PE contacts.

A major challenge lies in prioritizing biologically meaningful splicing events identified through short-read RNA sequencing. Existing splicing analysis tools typically rank target events based on splicing change magnitude or gene-level annotation, often without evaluating how resulting isoforms impact protein structure or function.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) dysfunction and impaired calcium (Ca2+) handling are recognized as central contributors to arterial stiffening and calcification. However, the molecular and functional determinants of Ca2+ clearance in vascular aging remains a topic of ongoing research. We identify the (Na+)-sodium/Ca2+-calcium (K+)-potassium-dependent exchanger 4 (NCKX4) as a critical functional regulator of VSMCs Ca2+ clearance and vascular integrity. We demonstrate that NCKX4 (coded by Slc24A4) expression is markedly reduced in aorta of aged (72-78 weeks) mice, with a pronounced decline in females. Functional assays revealed impaired Ca2+ clearance in both aged and Nckx4-/- VSMCs, which was accompanied by increased calcification. Histomorphometric analyses of young Nckx4-/- mice revealed fragmentation of elastic fibers, collagen accumulation, wall thickening, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, all hallmarks of vascular aging that closely resembled those of aged wild-type mice. Transcriptomic profiling of VSMCs showed that loss of NCKX4 alters pathways linked to Ca2+-integrin signaling, ECM turnover, and mineralization, including dysregulation of protective anchorage integrins, microfibril-stabilizing, osteogenic drivers and pro-fibrotic integrins. These findings support a model in which impaired Ca2+ clearance promotes maladaptive inside-out integrin signaling, disrupting VSMCs anchorage, ECM homeostasis, and mineralization processes. Collectively, our results establish NCKX4 as a previously unrecognized determinant of vascular aging, whose decline accelerates premature arterial remodeling and calcification. This study positions NCKX4 as a potential mechanistic link between age, sex-dependent vulnerability, and vascular stiffening, with implications for novel therapeutic strategies targeting Ca2+ handling in CVDs prevention.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Wnts are commonly induced by tissue damage but how they become activated transcriptionally is not well understood. Here, we report that mouse Wnt1 and Wnt10b are induced following injury in both lung and muscle. These Wnts occupy the same chromosome and are transcribed in opposite directions with 12kb between them. We identified a highly conserved cis-acting regulatory region (enhancer) residing between Wnt1 and Wnt10b that, when fused to a LacZ reporter, is activated post-injury. This enhancer harbors putative AP-1 binding sites that are required for reporter activity, a feature observed in other injury-responsive enhancers. Injured muscles in mice carrying a germ-line deletion of the enhancer region display reduced Wnt1 and Wnt10b expression and show elevated intramuscular adipogenesis--a hallmark of impaired regenerative capacity--revealing a requirement of this enhancer for proper regeneration.

In a one-shot experiment, observers each viewed a single trial with a random degree of hue change and provided one hue judgement response. Across participants, the entire morph was probed. Observers' hue reports revealed an overall bias towards the past that increased in magnitude as more of the morph was experienced.

The lack of biological markers for psychiatric conditions such as PTSD highlights the need for omics-based approaches to diagnosis. Discovery of novel blood-based biomarkers could aid in the development of treatments or therapies, quantify groups for those at the highest risk of adverse events, and provide insight into the molecular underpinnings of PTSD. This study used untargeted lipidomics to analyze 602 circulating lipid species in blood from a cohort of 133 veterans and combat members with varying severities of PTSD. We discovered five circulating lipids, including serum total cholesterol, cholesterol ether (ChE(18:2)), and lipids associated with metabolic dysfunction (CL(87:7), MLCL(50:4), PE(18:1e_20:3)) that correlated significantly with increasing PTSD severity after adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Without extended use of direct-acting antivirals FIP is invariably fatal, but there is potential for the emergence of anti-viral resistance. To understand host and viral factors associated with FIP, multiple tissues from cats with and without FIP were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and targeted sequencing of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was conducted for mesenteric lymph nodes in a larger cohort. Samples from cats with FIP demonstrated higher expression of genes involved in type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine signalling, as well as the adaptive immune response, and expression of these genes was highly correlated with FCoV abundance. Analysis of FCoV genomic variation across tissues revealed dynamic within-host evolution of FCoV, and identified distinct mutations associated with systemic virus spread both within and among cats. Assembly of TCR and B-cell receptor (BCR) sequences identified changes in the immune repertoire associated with FIP, highlighting the polyclonality and ineffectiveness of the immune response to FCoV in cats with FIP, and revealing the presence of potentially protective TCR clonotypes in cats without FIP. Together, these results represent the first analysis of immune repertoire in any feline infectious disease and demonstrate naturally occurring within-host evolution of FCoV.

Compared to a standard ready-to-use supplementary food, a microbiome-directed complementary food (MDCF-2) designed to repair these perturbations produced superior improvements in ponderal and linear growth in clinical trials of Bangladeshi children with moderate acute malnutrition. Here, reverse translation experiments are performed where intact fecal microbiomes collected from trial participants prior to and at the end of treatment are introduced into female gnotobiotic mice just after delivery of their pups. Pups received diets designed to resemble those consumed by children in the trials to recreate unrepaired and repaired gut ecosystems. Analyses of the abundances of bacterial strains (metagenome-assembled genomes), their expressed genes and metabolic products, combined with assessments of ponderal growth and intestinal epithelial lineage transcriptomes (single-nucleus RNA-Seq with follow-up immunocytochemistry) disclosed effects of MDCF-2 associated microbiome repair that cannot be determined, in part because no treatment control arms cannot be ethically incorporated into these trials. Specifically, microbiome repair in these mice produced significant increases in ponderal growth, changes microbial gene expression consistent with a less virulent gut ecosystem and changes in expression of (i) components of gut epithelial cell junctions in the enterocytic and goblet cell lineages, (ii) pathways for synthesis and secretion of eicosanoid immune effectors in chemosensory tuft cells, and (iii) goblet cell pathways involved in glycosylation and secretion of mucin.

In Tanzania, a series of RVF outbreaks in livestock have been reported. The epidemiological information about hosts exposures status, time, location and risk factors that contribute to virus maintenance between one epizootic and the other, is important for preparedness and intervention plans. This study investigated the seroprevalence and potential determinants of RVFV exposure in cattle in Babati, Hai, and Moshi Districts between the last RVF outbreak in 2007 and the anticipated El Nino rains of 2024, which could precipitate the next outbreak. Methods: A total of 1,627 cattle serum samples (790 from Babati, 518 from Moshi, and 319 from Hai), were collected between August and October 2023 from both urban and rural areas, were analyzed using a competitive ELISA to detect RVFV specific antibodies. Data on cattle biodata, management practices, environmental factors, were obtained through structured questionnaires and field records. Seroprevalence was determined by descriptive statistics, while risk factors were quantified by multivariable logistic regression and RVF seropositivity was plotted on administrative boundaries of Babati, Moshi, and Hai districts by using QGIS. Results: The overall RVFV seroprevalence was 15.0% (95% CI: 13.26 _ 16.73). Seropositivity was 22.2% (95% CI: 18.62_25.78) in Moshi, 12.2% (95% CI: 8.63_15.82) in Hai and 11.4% (95% CI 9.18_13.61) in Babati. Age (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.15_1.3, p<0.001), sex (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36_0.79, p = 0.0017), herd size (OR=0.2201; 95% CI: 0.095_0.5101; p=0.0004), water access along irrigated crop fields (OR=3.7181; 95% CI: 1.5868_8.7121; p=0.0025), and geographical location (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.63_3.06, p < 0.001) were significant predictors of seropositivity. Spatial visualization revealed clustering of seropositive herds in villages near lake Manyara and Tarangire National parks in Manyara region, also seropositive clusters in villages near irrigated areas, Nyumba ya Mungu dam and floodplains in lower Moshi. Conclusion: This study highlights ongoing inter-epizootic exposure of cattle to RVFV in northern Tanzania. The RVFV is not randomly distributed during inter_epizootic periods, but rather forms seropositive clusters. Most significant determinants of seropositivity includes age, sex, herd size, water access along irrigated crop fields and geographical location Moshi showing higher seropositivity.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Identifying its genetic determinants is crucial for enhancing understanding of its biological basis and clarifying its relationship with fracture risk. Methods: We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of TBS from 44,767 participants (95.08% European ancestry). Sex heterogeneity was assessed through sex-stratified GWAS. Post-GWAS analyses included functional annotation, gene-set enrichment analysis, and cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) colocalization. Two-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) were employed to investigate the causal effect of TBS on fractures. Findings: We identified 33 independent variants associated with TBS, which explained 4.06% of TBS phenotypic variance. All the discovered signals map to previously identified BMD-associated loci. Additionally, we identified genetic variants in the RAB11FIP3 locus that exhibited a sex-heterogeneous effect, being associated with TBS exclusively in males. Functional annotation and colocalization identified functional genes related to TBS. The two-sample and multivariable MR analyses indicated that TBS potentially has an independent causal effect on fracture risk. Interpretation: Our study unveiled 33 independent loci associated with TBS, all in BMD-associated loci. One locus was further identified as associated with TBS only in males. MR results suggested that genetically derived TBS may be causally associated with fracture risk at different sites, potentially beyond BMD.

Glycosylation imparts structural chirality to graphene quantum dots (GQDs), directing site-selective assembly of indocyanine green (ICG) that turns on photoinduced electron transfer (PET), producing a 64-fold increase in ROS relative to free ICG. Nanochirality also modulates extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. L-GQDs show a less favorable hyaluronan binding free energy, thus accelerating interstitial transport and resulting in ~21-fold deeper tumor penetration by L-Chi-GAIN than conventional nanocarriers. Under near-infrared irradiation, L-Chi-GAIN elicits strong oxidative stress and triggers Gasdermin-D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptosis, leading to significant suppression of tumor growth.

On the CAMEO2024, CASP15, and CASP16 evaluation datasets, the model achieves backbone RMSDs of 0.4377, 0.5293, and 0.7567, respectively, and achieves 100\\% codebook utilization on a held-out validation set, substantially outperforming prior VQVAE-based tokenizers and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Beyond these benchmarks, on a zero-shot set of 1,938 completely new experimental structures, GCP-VQVAE attains a backbone RMSD of 0.8193 and a TM-score of 0.9673, demonstrating robust generalization to unseen proteins. Lastly, we elaborate on the various applications of this foundation-like model, such as protein structure compression and the integration of generative protein language models.

However, the feasibility of applying machine learning (ML) models to predict FSHD using these molecular signatures has not been explored. In this study, we developed ML models to predict FSHD using a multi-omics dataset comprising protein abundance and miRNA expression profiles. Key predictive features were identified using Random Forest and the Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) methods. Performance evaluations demonstrated the robustness of the ML classifiers, with logistic regression consistently achieving the robust predictive accuracy in distinguishing FSHD from healthy conditions. Additionally, we assessed the predictive power of the identified features by comparing them with biomarker sets reported in previous studies.

Such experiments characterize thousands of image features in millions of cells across thousands of experimental conditions. Analytical difficulties arise with this scale of analysis as many features have distributions with extremely long tails, high skewness, remote outliers, and high-leverage points. This makes important signals difficult to find and means analyses are often sensitive to individual observations or features. This work considers a recent high-quality Cell Painting dataset profiling compounds from the EU-OPENSCREEN consortium. The study perturbs HepG2 human liver cancer cells in order to morphologically profile cellular response to the compounds. Without adjustment, analysis of the imaging data is hampered by long-tailed distributions and outliers. To combat this, we introduce Wasserstein Geodesic Transformations (WGTs), a new approach that adaptively moves features in Wasserstein space to make downstream analysis less ad-hoc, more stable, and more scalable. In application to the Cell Painting data, WGTs substantially improve data analysis by enhancing visualization, improving compound clustering, and stabilizing analyses. They also help uncover unwanted spatial effects arising from plate layout, explaining some outlying compound responses.

We have characterized and implemented a novel, fluorescence-based method of measuring 5-HT binding to gain a fuller understanding of the interactions between 5-HT and its receptors. This method involves expression of 5-HT receptor proteins with the fluorescent, non-canonical amino acid L-3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropanoic acid (ANAP) incorporated into the ligand binding site. ANAP fluorescence was quenched in solution by both 5-HT and dopamine. Time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed that ANAP quenching by 5-HT involved a rapidly reversible charge-transfer process. Based on density functional theory calculations, this process likely involved a ANAP reduction by 5-HT as assessed using whole-cell patch clamp. To test this method on intact receptors in a cellular context, we expressed 5-HT3A receptors (5-HT-gated ion channels) in HEK293T cells with ANAP inserted co-translationally into the transmitter binding site. Fluorescently labeled 5-HT3A receptors were functional and activated by 5-HT. Addition of 5-HT caused a concentration-dependent quenching of fluorescence from ANAP-tagged channels expressed in intact cells and unroofed plasma membranes, demonstrating the utility of this method for measuring 5-HT binding to its receptors. Collectively, these results delineate a technique for measuring transmitter binding that can be widely adopted to measure 5-HT binding not only to 5-HT3 receptors, but to any 5-HT receptor, transporter, or binding protein.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

MetSCs are tumor cell subpopulations enriched for their ability to reinitiate and sustain metastatic growth, displaying phenotypic plasticity and resistance to chemotherapy. These cells express the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), a transmembrane protein detected in numerous human solid tumor types and at multiple disseminated organ sites. As a selective surface marker of MetSCs, L1CAM is a promising candidate for molecularly targeted drugs aimed at eliminating metastases, yet strategies to date have not achieved clinical success. Here, we develop antibody-drug conjugates to deliver highly toxic PNU-159682 payloads to L1CAM-expressing cells. We report the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with high binding affinity, specificity and selectivity for the human L1CAM extracellular domain. Optimized L1CAM-targeting mAbs were conjugated to PNU-159682 to generate ADC variants with both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, with an average drug-antibody-ratio (DAR) of four. ADCs derived from three antibodies targeting various epitopes of the L1CAM extracellular portion potently killed cells exhibiting varying levels of surface L1CAM expression. L1CAM ADCs given as monotherapy resulted in robust tumor control and extended survival in mice harboring subcutaneous L1CAM+ xenografts or L1CAM+ lung metastases from triple-negative basal breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma.

Here, we identify Notch1 as a pivotal regulator of hyaloid vessel clearance, acting independently of apoptosis to coordinate endothelial detachment, transient plasticity, and migration. Using an endothelial-specific Notch1 knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of Notch1 results in persistent hyaloid vasculature characterized by excessive proliferation and stabilization of the vascular network. Mechanistically, Notch1 activation during the regression window induces endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) marked by Snail1 and Slug upregulation. This transcriptional signature is accompanied by detachment of endothelial cells from the vascular tubes. In contrast, Notch1-deficient hyaloid vessels retain endothelial cells stably adherent to the vessel wall. Further analysis reveals that Wnt receptors FZD4, LRP5 and LRP6 previously implicated in hyaloid involution are transcriptionally downregulated in Notch1-deficient hyaloids, suggesting that the collaboration between these processes may occur through crosstalk between the Notch and Wnt pathways. Collectively, our findings uncover a Notch1-driven multicellular regression program that governs developmental vessel regression, redefining the molecular principles of vascular pruning.

TAT1 localized to the flagellar tip, suggesting that it is the primary site of acetylation. Loss of acetylation caused an increase in axonemal tubulin turnover, as revealed by dikaryon-fusion assays. Unexpectedly, the tat1 mutant displayed an increased number of dynamic cytoplasmic microtubules and could regenerate long flagella after amputation, even when protein synthesis was inhibited. Despite these cytoskeletal changes, steady-state flagellar length, cell growth, and cell division remained essentially normal.

These stimuli include environmental odorants that evoke positive approach behavior and negative avoidance behavior. While stimulus perception has evolved similarly across ecological niches, we still do not know the mechanisms that drive evolution of stimulus perception across taxa. The blind Mexican cavefish provides a unique model for understanding how changes in environmental pressures impact the evolution of the vertebrate brain and behaviors. For instance, cavefish exhibit sleep loss due to life in an environment with no sunlight. Therefore, we wondered how odor perception has evolved in cave adapted populations that experience vastly different environmental conditions and odors than their surface ancestors. We found that surface fish display approach behaviors when exposed to food and social odors, while exhibiting avoidance behaviors when exposed to alarm and death odors. Conversely, we find that cave populations exhibit approach behaviors when exposed to alarm and death odors in the dark, while only females show approach behaviors when exposed to social odors. In addition, we find that surface to cave F2 hybrids display a range of behaviors, from full avoidance to approach when exposed to social, alarm and death odors, that suggests these differences are genetically inheritable. Finally, forebrain phospho-ERK mapping revealed overlap in the activity of thalamic and preoptic subregions of the brain when cavefish were exposed to food or death odors. Taken together, we find that changes to cavefish odor perception provide a unique model for investigating the genetic and neurological mechanisms underlying olfactory evolution in vertebrates.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Viral recombination occurs during simultaneous infection of an individual host with multiple strains (co-infection). This means that processes which affect the incidence of a disease in the host population affect how often viral genotypes recombine. We investigate whether and how host traits influence the rate of viral recombination using a mathematical model that makes feedbacks between viral evolution and host ecology explicit. Using approximations from population genetics, we find that viruses of host species that are short-lived, acutely infected, or whose immunity wanes quickly recombine more frequently than those of hosts that are relatively long-lived, chronically infected, and have long-lasting immunity. This is because of differences in the density of (co-)infections at equilibrium. Using highly pathogenic avian influenza sequence data we test the prediction that recombination is elevated in short-lived hosts. In agreement with this prediction, the magnitude of statistical associations between mutations on different segments of the flu genome increases with host body size, a proxy for lifespan. We discuss the implications of these findings for emergence.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Rodent models capture biventricular changes, including at the cell- and organ-scale, and pulmonary vascular remodeling seen in preterm humans. However, synthesizing these measures across scales and organ systems is challenging. We hypothesized that in-silico modeling of biventricular mitochondrial, myofiber, and organ-scale function plus circulatory function could capture key features of cardiopulmonary abnormalities due to preterm birth. Therefore, we calibrated a multiscale model to subject-specific biventricular pressure-volume data from a hyperoxic rat model of preterm birth alongside normoxic controls to investigate the impact of preterm birth on multiscale cardiopulmonary function. The calibrated model demonstrates excellent agreement with the data and captures the expected increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular dilation also seen in preterm born. Simulations also predict an increase in right ventricular myofiber power and rapid septal wall flattening with subsequent rapid return to normal curvature, or septal bounce. By calibrating a multiscale model to organ-scale data, we identified correlations between septal motion, pulmonary arterial resistance, and right ventricular myofiber power, suggesting that septal bounce may be a non-invasive marker of preterm right ventricular dysfunction severity. Our multiscale modeling approach captures cardiopulmonary abnormalities across spatial scales and provides an innovative approach to explore the consequences of preterm birth beyond experimental data alone.

This genetic mouse model demonstrates that AKT-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation is the predominant mechanism of hepatic mTORC1 induction by insulin but is dispensable for activation by feeding. Furthermore, dietary protein is critical and dictates the insulin-responsiveness of hepatic mTORC1 signaling. Contrary to dogma, hepatic mTORC1 signaling was not elevated in response to diet-induced obesity associated with the phenotypes of type-2 diabetes, including hyperinsulinemia, systemic insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia, and blocking hepatic AKT-TSC-mTORC1 signaling did not prevent these metabolic impairments.

Reverse-phase protein array profiling and partial least squares regression modeling revealed that AKT, GSK3, and MAPK signaling are differentially regulated by hypertrophic agonists and are predictive of distinct phenotypic outcomes. Nrg1 uniquely induced cardiomyocyte elongation in both neonatal rat and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, in addition to increasing cell area.

Building on results at the crossroads of evolutionary theory and game theory, it is first shown that in an uninvadable population state of behavioral rule evolution, individuals are compelled to use strategies that are Nash equilibria of a lineage fitness game. Thus, choice behavior evolves to be representable as the maximization of a utility function, as if each individual holds a personal preference that orders own and interaction partner strategies. Second, the paper contrasts two representations of personal utility that are found to be uninvadable. The first is semi-Kantian in form. This preference averages a fitness self-interest with a relatedness weighted Kantian interest. The latter interest evaluates the consequence of own behavior for own fitness, assuming the interaction partner adopts the same behavior as self. The second preference is a personal inclusive fitness. This preference combines a self-regarding interest with a relatedness weighted other-regarding interest. Each such interest takes the form of an average effect, which evaluates the consequence of expressing own behavior, instead of average population behavior, on a statistical average fitness to self and the interaction partner.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Most existing methods depend on companion single-cell datasets and are sensitive to cell segmentation. We present SpacGPA, a segmentation-free, single-cell-independent framework that identifies de novo interpretable gene programs--co-expressed gene modules capturing key biological processes--from spatial transcriptomes. Leveraging GPU-acceleration and block-matrix operations, SpacGPA efficiently detects gene programs based on a graphical Gaussian model in ultra-large datasets. These programs exhibit domain-specific spatial expression patterns and cell type-specific expression in independent single-cell datasets, serving as robust markers for spatial domains. Applied to four mouse and human spatial datasets, SpacGPA identified 58-109 gene programs per dataset, revealing refined tissue structures. Hub genes within these programs correlate with canonical cell type markers and SVGs, enabling systematic SVG identification. The programs are also functionally enriched and transferable across datasets and platforms.

However, this remains a challenge in established techniques: for surface plasmon resonance, bulk refractive-index shifts and non-specific adsorption in hydrogel matrices can dominate the signal in serum, whereas for isothermal titration calorimetry, complex media primarily introduce large, composition-dependent background heats and run-to-run variability that obscure the binding enthalpy. Here, we demonstrate that focal molography, a label-free optical biosensing method, can reliably measure the kinetics and thermodynamics of the protein kinase A regulatory subunit binding to cyclic AMP derivatives in both buffer and 50% human serum. By performing the kinetic measurement over a range of temperatures, we were able to reveal that binding remains highly favorable in both environments, yet the results suggest that the balance of driving forces shifts toward enthalpic contributions in serum. This hints at the substantial difference of interaction mechanisms in a complex biological media compared to buffer systems. Our findings show that focal molography reliably quantifies protein-ligand interactions in complex media, providing consistent kinetic and thermodynamic data while overcoming limitations of existing methods. This highlights the potential of focal molography as a valuable tool for studying interactions under near-native conditions.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

While their contribution to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation through matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been explored, the role of other macrophage-derived factors in ECM remodeling and their impacts beyond degradation remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the development of a 3D collagen-based tumor spheroid model to investigate the impact of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived macrophages on cancer cell-ECM and cancer cell-macrophage interactions within the TME. We observed that cancer cells stimulated PBMC-derived macrophages into an M2-like phenotype and that tumor spheroid conditioned macrophages (TSCMs) shifted cancer cell populations toward phenotypes with greater invasion distances and reduced circularity, indicative of increased malignancy. Such observations can be explained by macrophage-mediated ECM remodeling. Specifically, we demonstrate that TSCMs secreted a variety of soluble factors that are known to contribute to ECM remodeling, including ECM degradation and fiber realignment. These processes collectively create a tumor-favoring environment by loosening the collagen matrix and aligning fibers that serve as invasion tracks for migrating tumor cells that facilitate cancer cell migration and invasion. This model provides a robust platform to study the interactions between cellular and non-cellular components in the TME and to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression.

Early molecular rewiring indicative of a DNA damage response was detected by phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic profiling within days post-exposure. Transcriptomic analyses identified a persistent and robust interferon response as the dominant activated pathway. This chronic interferon signaling, which remained unresolved, correlated with extensive clonal expansion, an early hallmark of oncogenesis.

To address this, we develop a variational autoencoder (VAE)-latent neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) approach that learns a low-dimensional latent representation of cellular states and models their temporal evolution. We apply our framework to the single-cell fluorescence imaging spatiotemporal atlas of Drosophila melanogaster blastoderm embryos via spatial registration, which comprises six registered developmental time points prior to gastrulation. In our approach, gene expression profiles are encoded into a latent space where a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) is trained to capture the continuous dynamics of cellular states over time, and a decoder subsequently maps these evolving latent representations back to the original high-dimensional gene expression space, enabling accurate reconstruction of observed transcriptional patterns. While such black-box deep learning approaches excel at capturing complex dynamical trajectories, they are inherently limited in their ability to predict the effects of combinatorial perturbations. To overcome this limitation, we leverage the inferred latent dynamics as a foundation for fitting a mechanistic Hill-function model of gene regulation, which--guided by the black-box representations--enables interpretable predictions by systematically perturbing couplings between specific gene pairs and thus provides mechanistic insight into developmental regulatory programs.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a novel high-resolution ultrasound-photoacoustic (PA) imaging approach enabling real-time, non-invasive monitoring of deep cerebrovascular oxygenation dynamics in awake mice with intact skulls. Materials and Methods: Swiss male and female mice (n = 5-6) were head-fixed using a customized holder adapted to the Neurotar Mobile HomeCage floating platform. High-resolution ultrasound combined with PA imaging (VevoLAZR-X, VisualSonics) was used to discriminate oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin in multiple brain regions. Cerebrovascular responses were assessed under three paradigms: (i) baseline awake state vs. 2% isoflurane anesthesia, and (ii) right whisker stimulation to probe sensory-driven hemodynamics. Results: PA imaging successfully resolved deep-brain oxygenation in awake, intact-skull mice. Under isoflurane anesthesia, we observed a rapid and transient increase in cerebrovascular sO2; (p < 0.01). During whisker stimulation, we detected robust, region-specific increases in total hemoglobin, reflecting localized neurovascular coupling in awake mice. Conclusions: This study establishes high-resolution PA imaging as a powerful, non-invasive tool to monitor cerebrovascular oxygenation dynamics in awake mice. By integrating baseline, anesthetic, and sensory paradigms, we demonstrate its potential to dissect neurovascular physiology without the confounding effects of anesthesia.

Approach and Results: We joined two ICH cohorts (N= 200, 45% women: 76.8{+/-}13 years; 55% men: 67.9{+/-}14 years). DNAm levels were obtained from whole blood samples using Illumina EPIC array.

Using BLAST homology analysis, we demonstrate that the oligomer-forming splice isoform A0A7P0Z4F7 is conserved across distantly related mammals, including the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas), with E-values of 2e-12 and 3e-10, respectively. More distant homology was detected in bacterial proteins, indicating an origin potentially extending back 2-3 billion years. Phylogenetic reconstruction identified the evolutionary breakpoint at which beta-sheet oligomerization first emerged, likely driven by truncation-induced destabilization of helix packing. This structural exaptation may have persisted through constrained neutral evolution, with beta-sheet assemblies stabilized in the absence of functional transport activity. We also identify a highly conserved 10-residue motif (WLDSLLAIDA), absolutely preserved across unrelated proteins, including transcriptional regulators and ATPases. Our findings further suggest that the persistence of beta-sheet isoforms can be framed within an evolutionary game-theoretic landscape, where alternative folding strategies coexist as stable equilibria sustained by conserved motifs. Such conservation highlights fundamental biophysical constraints on protein folding and oligomerization, with possible implications for the functional evolution of neural glutamate transporters and their roles in disease.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Ageing skull niches consistently show loss of mesenchymal and osteoprogenitors, suppression of angiogenic and lymphatic programs, adipocyte accumulation, vascular senescence, DNA replication stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, and heightened inflammation. Proteomic profiling further highlights this vulnerability, demonstrating that vertebral niches, unlike the skull are relatively spared from these ageing hallmarks.

In this study, we investigated the localization and functional role of a novel microtubule-associated protein, Apicortin, uniquely conserved in apicomplexans and the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens. Apicortin contains both a doublecortin (DCX) domain and a partial tubulin polymerisation-promoting protein (TPPP) domain, both implicated in microtubule binding and stabilization. Using live cell imaging of transgenic Plasmodium berghei lines expressing GFP-tagged Apicortin, we observed its expression at the apical end of invasive transmission stages during parasite development within the mosquito vector. High-resolution imaging, including super-resolution and expansion microscopy, further revealed that Apicortin forms a distinct ring-like structure at the apical end of ookinetes and sporozoites, coinciding with the apical complex region. Surprisingly, functional analysis through gene knockout demonstrated that Apicortin is not essential for parasite development or transmission through the mosquito, suggesting potential redundancy in apical complex stabilization mechanisms or compensatory functions.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

While Tgfb2 knockout mice die at birth and adult heterozygotes develop late, non-dissecting or non-rupturing aneurysms, the role of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived TGF{beta}2 in postnatal aortic homeostasis and disease remains undefined. Approach and Results: We generated tamoxifen-inducible, SMC-specific Tgfb2 conditional knockout mice (Tgfb2cKO) by crossing Tgfb2flox alleles with Myh11CreERT2 and ROSAmT/mG lineage reporter mice. Tgfb2 deletion was induced at 4 weeks of age. Tgfb2cKO mice developed rapidly progressive aneurysms involving both ascending and descending aortas, with intramural dissection and/or rupture at the proximal descending aorta. Lineage tracing confirmed loss of Tgfb2-deficient SMCs during disease progression. Histological and morphometric analyses revealed elastic fiber fragmentation, SMC loss and de-differentiation, medial thickening, adventitial fibrosis, and accumulation of collagen and proteoglycans. Molecular profiling demonstrated reduced expression of SMC contractile genes (Acta2, Myh11), increased fibrillar collagen (Col1a1) expression, early suppression of SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and increased non-canonical TGF{beta}2 signaling via p38 and pERK1/2 MAPK pathways.

Additionally, these protein-coding genes occupy long stretches of DNA that incur significant metabolic burdens on host cells, which negatively impacts plasmid manufacturability and functionality, leading to high production cost and compromised clinical efficacy.

Towards this end, we computationally profile and characterize the sequence and structure statistics and properties of hundreds of thousands of potential small proteins proposed through free unconstrained generation from architecturally distinct PLMs. We show that although these models exhibit a prodigious latent capacity to access novel amino-acid sequences, they struggle to approach the structural variation that exists on plain display in nature.

We demonstrate DREAMER-S in its application to tissue images captured by Quantum Cascade Laser IR imaging, where the model assigns attention weights to each spectrum, producing spatial \"importance maps\" that localize class-relevant regions without requiring manual annotation, and automatically surfaces the most informative spatial instances for downstream analysis. As the DREAMER-S MIL attention layer yields ROI maps and an instance-level filter, the technique is broadly applicable across spatial biology tasks to narrow regions-of-interest in high-content imaging datasets. We demonstrate the approach on a chemotherapy-response task in colorectal cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, separating a chemo-sensitive class (CRC0344) from a less responsive class (CRC0076) with a best validation F1-score of ~0.95 using a compact, residual-free linear network tuned by grid search. The attention mechanism both accelerates computation and functions as a data-reduction stage, enabling targeted interpretation with SHAP that highlights biochemically meaningful spectral features (nucleic acids, lipids, amide features) while excluding sample artifacts such as paraffin wax. In validating DREAMER-S from an explainability perspective, we connect model saliency to cellular physiology, finding: (1) unsupervised embeddings of the high-attention spectra stratify samples by treatment (FOLFOX, ABT-199, combination, vehicle), and (2) selected spectral markers correlate with pro-apoptotic proteins (Bim, Puma) measured independently in the same PDX system, overall supporting a mechanistic link between spectral signals and apoptosis pathways.

Certain AMPs exhibit a low hemolytic index and non-forming fibrils at physiological pH (7.4), enhancing their therapeutic potential. In this study, we employ constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations to investigate the pH-dependent behavior of a 13-residue-long positively charged AMP, GL13K, focusing on the deprotonation states of lysine residues in a single GL13K AMP and their impact on its structural dynamics. We show that the last lysine located near the C-terminus (LYS11) has a significant deprotonation ratio difference with other lysine residues at the reported average experimental side chain pKa value. We observe that increasing the pH results in eventual decrease of the radius of gyration and end-to-end radius and dominance of random coil structure in metastable states. Overall, our study shows the pH-dependent conformational dynamics and pKa variations of lysine residues in the GL13K antimicrobial peptide, providing critical insights into its structural behavior in solution. These findings establish a foundation for further exploration of GL13K in multi-peptide systems, advancing its potential development as an antimicrobial agent.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

We employed an integrated approach combining RNA sequencing, molecular docking, microscale thermophoresis, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular targets of magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG). Chronic-binge alcohol-fed mouse models and ethanol/palmitic acid-exposed AML-12 hepatocytes were used to evaluate its hepatoprotective effects. Hepatocyte-specific genetic manipulations were performed to validate downstream signaling pathways. MgIG was found to directly bind hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 1 (HSD11B1) at residue Lys187. In vivo, MgIG significantly ameliorated alcohol-induced liver injury, reducing histological damage, hepatic steatosis, and abnormal liver-to-body weight ratios. In vitro, it attenuated lipid accumulation, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis identified isopentenyl diphosphate delta isomerase 1 (IDI1) as a key downstream effector, and genetic validation confirmed that MgIG modulates the HSD11B1-SREBP2-IDI1 axis, thereby suppressing lipogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis. We reveal HSD11B1 as a novel direct molecular target of MgIG and elucidate its therapeutic mechanism through the HSD11B1-SREBP2-IDI1 signaling axis, which profoundly impacts ALD pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Conventional dynamic fMRI metrics treat networks as memoryless and cannot capture the persistence that makes some states fleeting and others entrenched. We introduce the functional inertia index (FII), the first index to quantify temporal momentum by measuring the force required to deviate from a brain's long-running trajectory. Applied to resting-state fMRI from a multisite schizophrenia cohort, FII revealed distinct recurrent states, with prolonged residence in a high-inertia plateau predicting greater symptom severity. This effect was mediated by whole-brain FII, which also showed a positive relationship with cognition in patients but a negative relationship in controls, revealing a dissociation between adaptive and maladaptive rigidity. At the regional level, FII unifies two long-standing observations in schizophrenia: excessive rigidity in associative hubs and pathological volatility in sensory pathways, situating both within a single inertial framework and offering a candidate dynamic biomarker.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Analysis of collagen content and organization in human ovaries revealed increased coherence associated with fibrosis in premenopausal BRCA+ ovaries relative to those without a BRCA mutation. Brca1 deficiency in murine ovarian fibroblasts triggered the expression of hallmarks of senescence, including Cdkn2a (p16) and acidic {beta}-galactosidase activity.

Some of these microtubule-mediated processes are conserved in all eukaryotic lineages while others are specific for certain groups of organisms. Here, we focus on the microtubule cytoskeleton of oomycetes in the genus Phytophthora, a group of harmful plant pathogens. For visualizing microtubule organization and dynamics, we generated transgenic Phytophthora palmivora lines expressing GFP-tagged -tubulin. Besides a conserved localization in the mitotic spindle, we observed cytoplasmic microtubules originating from microtubule-organizing centers associated with nuclei in the coenocytic hyphae. These dynamic microtubules initiated long-lasting, antiparallel connections with microtubules originating from adjacent nuclei. After mitosis, these microtubules rapidly increased in length while maintaining their antiparallel interaction. Frequent buckling events suggest that microtubule-based force generation plays a role in nuclear spacing. This idea was strengthened by erratic nuclear motility and positioning in hyphae exposed to the microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin. Besides aberrant nuclear positioning we also observed defects in hyphal growth; in oryzalin-treated hyphae lacking microtubules, tip growth was less sustained than in non-treated hyphae. This suggests that microtubules radiating into the hyphal tip from the apical nucleus have a function in sustaining tip growth. Altogether, this study provides novel insights in the localization, dynamics and functions of the microtubule cytoskeleton in the coenocytic Phytophthora hyphae.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Heavy infestations of this insect have contributed to significant yield losses in Central Europe, but little is known about how different B. vulgaris genotypes influence vector behavior and performance. Understanding such interactions is critical for both pest management and the development of sugar beet cultivars that are less favorable to the vector. We investigated oviposition decisions, nymphal development, and belowground chemotaxis of P. leporinus using twelve B. vulgaris genotypes: eight sugar beet genotypes with contrasting SBR tolerance, two Swiss chard, and two beetroot varieties. In no choice assays, females oviposited at similar rates on all tested genotypes, indicating broad host suitability. However, in three choice tests, significant differences emerged, with several genotypes receiving more egg batches than the reference variety Vasco. Despite adult host preferences, nymphal survival, growth, and instar development did not differ among genotypes. In contrast, belowground olfactometer assays revealed that nymphs exhibited clear chemotactic responses: several genotypes attracted significantly more individuals than others. This represents the first documentation of chemotactic host location in P. leporinus nymphs. Our findings reveal a mismatch between adult oviposition preference and nymphal performance, a pattern not uncommon in other generalist herbivores. Both adult and nymphal behaviors were nevertheless influenced by genotype-specific traits, likely linked to plant chemistry. Identifying these cues could inform breeding strategies aimed at reducing vector attraction, thereby complementing pathogen-targeted approaches and supporting integrated management of SBR in sugar beet.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Fish and invertebrate communities were surveyed at two kelp farms and compared to nearby natural kelp forests and pelagic control sites. Results from gill-net fishing, camera observations, and invertebrate sampling revealed lower species richness and abundance at kelp farms compared to natural habitats. eDNA analyses (12S and CO1 markers) showed few differences in community composition between sites, and no species were identified as indicators of kelp farms. Traditional sampling detected the presence of the amphipod Caprella mutica in the kelp farms, indicating that operators can play roles in alien species spread. Overall, kelp farms supported distinct but less diverse communities than natural kelp forests, being more similar to pelagic control sites. Finally, eDNA provided limited insights compared to traditional methods. These findings suggest that kelp farms currently provide limited habitat provisioning in Norway, likely as a result of how and where kelp aquaculture is currently performed. We suggest the need for population-level assessments for relevant species like Atlantic lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) and locally based assessments in collaboration with authorities to define nature-positive or negative outcomes to balance ecological and economic goals in the growing seaweed aquaculture industries of the Atlantic.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

The C-terminal region of UBQLN2 is lysine-depleted, and we show that introducing lysine residues in this region leads to its E6AP-dependent degradation. The UBL domain critically stabilizes UBQLN2 and protects it from proteasomal degradation.

The developed serum-free process generated clonally derived PCLs with productivity and product quality on par with traditional serum-based methods. This approach significantly reduced the cell line generation timeline and eliminated the challenge related to serum supplementation, adapting it to industry requirements.

We study a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) network in which the local excitability is extended by a fifth-order nonlinearity and the global coupling strength adapts homeostatically to the spatial variance of neural activity. Using a combination of numerical bifurcation analysis and direct time-domain simulation, we map regimes of quiescence, stable fixed point, and self-sustained oscillation in the two-parameter space of input current and nonlinearity. The analytically predicted Hopf boundary agrees closely with the simulated transition to oscillations. Extending to networks with ring, Watts-Strogatz, and Barabasi-Albert topologies, we show that variance-driven adaptation strongly increases coupling and synchrony in rings, is partly suppressed in small-world graphs, and is almost ineffective in scale-free networks where hubs dominate connectivity. A simple feedback controller regulating the Kuramoto order parameter enables targeted desynchronization or resynchronization. Finally, stochastic forcing produces a non-monotonic impact on coherence, suggesting noise-induced resonance effects. This simulation-based framework links single-neuron excitability, network topology, and adaptive coupling control, and may inform strategies for brain-computer interfaces and neuromodulation therapies.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Phosphorylation is the most common post-translational protein modification, often acting as the activator of protein function. In the case of MEK1, a member of the MAP kinase family, phosphorylation of both S218 and S222 are necessary for activation. Yet the molecular activation mechanism and its cooperative nature are poorly understood, especially due to the lack of experimental phosphorylated MEK1 structures. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural and dynamical consequences of single and double phosphorylation in MEK1. We find that successive phosphorylation progressively unwinds the helix containing the phosphorylation sites, thereby rotating the phosphate groups to directly interact with the catalytic site. Consequently, the solvent accessible surface area of the catalytic residues increase with phosphorylation. Yet, only in the double-phosphorylated state do all four critical catalytic residues become solvent exposed. By calculating the conformational entropy, we find that only in the double-phosphorylated state do all four catalytic residues have mutual information with each other, suggesting that phosphorylation also induces correlated motion at the active site. To validate our approach, we show that our simulations predict the alignment of the R-spine motif in the double-phosphorylated state, in agreement with the other kinases for which this alignment has been experimentally observed. These results show that phosphorylation can, via a partial unfolding mechanism, increase the solvent exposure of and dynamical coupling within the active site, both of which are critical for enzymatic activity.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

J.; Morales, S.; Senior, J.; Mather, M.", "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies have shown that age-related dysregulation of the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system is associated with cognitive decline. However, due to limitations in directly measuring LC function in vivo, it remains unclear whether age-related alterations in humans reflect tonic LC-NA system hyper- or hypoactivity, constraining our understanding of underlying mechanisms and hampers the development of targeted preventative interventions. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that cognitively healthy older adults sustain tonic LC hyperactivity, by acquiring electrophysiological, pupillometric, and behavioral measures during a passive and active auditory oddball paradigm. We capitalized on the LC-NA system's role in arousal regulation and manipulated state arousal using the unpredictable threat of electric shock. We hypothesized that if older adults maintain elevated LC activity compared with young adults, task-evoked noradrenergic responses would be less responsive to arousal in older adults. Consistent with this hypothesis, arousal elicited weaker behavioral responses, pupil dilation responses, and P300 event-related potentials in older adults compared with young adults. Linear mixed models revealed an arousal by modality interaction, showing that arousal differentially modulated attentional control to salient but task-irrelevant distractors between both age groups. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that aging is associated with tonic LC-NA system hyperactivity in humans, with neuromodulatory consequences for mechanisms of attentional control. Furthermore, the multimodal approach underscores the potential of non-invasive physiological markers to assess LC-NA system function throughout aging and identify individuals at elevated risk for neurodegenerative progression prior to the emergence of clinical biomarkers.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Global and resting-state network dynamics in DoC were closer to equilibrium than in controls, decreasing stepwise with decreasing levels of consciousness. Mapping site specific hierarchical drive over the system revealed disruptions within default-mode network components (e.g., medial and dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus) and subcortical hubs (e.g., thalamus, pallidum and putamen) differentiating between all groups. Recovery of near-control hierarchy in the visual network differentiated MCS from UWS, whereas multiple limbic areas showed similar abnormalities across both DoC groups.

We investigated the burden of brain TDP-43 pathology across ageing, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and examined ferritin as a region-specific correlate of TDP-43 pathology. Methods: Pathological TDP-43 was detected using an HDGFL2 cryptic exon in situ hybridisation probe and a TDP-43 RNA aptamer, providing greater sensitivity and specificity than antibody-based approaches. Amygdala, hippocampus, and frontal cortex tissue was analysed from non-neurological controls (ages 40-80), AD cases, and ALS cases. Ferritin (as a proxy for iron accumulation) was quantified in parallel to assess its association with TDP-43 pathology. Findings: TDP-43 pathology was detectable from the fourth decade of life, with a 4.5-fold increase in hippocampal involvement after age 60 years. In AD, pathology was present in 90% of cases and distinguished from ageing by selective amygdala involvement. In ALS, TDP-43 pathology was nearly ubiquitous across all regions studied. Regional ferritin strongly predicted TDP-43 burden: amygdala ferritin explained 87% of TDP-43 variance in ALS and 66% in AD, while hippocampal ferritin differentiated AD from controls. Across AD, ferritin explained between 43-81% of regional TDP-43 variance. Interpretation: TDP-43 brain pathology emerges in midlife with increased involvement after age 60 years, exhibits disease-specific regional signatures in AD and ALS, and is closely linked to ferritin accumulation. As TDP-43 confers a worse prognosis in AD, the capacity of ferritin, detectable with iron-sensitive MRI, to serve as a proxy for regional TDP-43 burden highlights its promise as a biomarker for disease stratification and prognosis.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

M.; Lak, A.; Packer, A. M.", "abstract": "The combination of two-photon calcium imaging and two-photon optogenetic stimulation, termed all-optical interrogation, provides spatial and temporal precision when recording and manipulating neural circuit activity in vivo. All-optical experiments often use red-shifted opsins in combination with green fluorescent reporters of neuronal activity. However, their excitation spectra still partially overlap, meaning that the imaging laser can excite the opsin. Though some care has been taken in the past to understand the effects of this spectral overlap, further work is required to understand its impact on the findings of all-optical studies. We aimed to investigate whether two-photon imaging of the green fluorescent calcium reporter GCaMP6s at 920 nm increases the rate of desensitization in neurons expressing the red-shifted opsin C1V1. We systematically varied either the inter-stimulus interval or the duration of two-photon calcium imaging during two-photon optogenetic stimulation of mouse layer 2/3 barrel cortex or visual cortex neurons. We found that two-photon imaging at 920 nm increases the desensitization of photostimulation responses across trials in C1V1-expressing neurons - an effect that is exacerbated at shorter inter-stimulus intervals. Reduced photostimulation responses are not limited to targeted cells, and are found across the entire field of view. Such network effects are less pronounced at shorter imaging doses. Our results provide methodological optimizations that enable opsin desensitization to be mitigated in all-optical experiments. This will reduce an external source of trial-by-trial variability in future all-optical experiments.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Current conceptualizations of episodic and semantic memory interactions emphasize a one-way consolidation from episodic traces in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to semantic knowledge in neocortex (CTX). However, this tradition has left largely unexplored how semantic memory may affect episodic encoding of new memories. Here we introduce a cognitive model in which the code used in episodic memories shifts from purely sensorial to including explicit semantic representations of stored events. Simultaneously, we propose a computational circuit model of how such a cognitive strategy could be implemented in the brain using biologically-plausible learning rules. We show that increased sparsity during replay enables neocortex to extract compositional structure from overlapping episodes, which creates a dictionary of inter-connected concepts in semantic memory. Furthermore, we show that spontaneous activity in neocortical areas can imprint the abstracted representations into the medial temporal lobe, giving rise to concept-like cells. This bidirectional interaction improves episodic recall and replay fidelity, and facilitates the consolidation of higher-order representations based on previous semantic knowledge. The model accounts for behavioural advantages of schema-congruent learning, the emergence of concept neurons, and enhanced memory performance for semantically familiar stimuli. Together, our results provide a mechanistic account of how episodes and concepts reinforce each other, extending standard consolidation theories and suggesting a cooperative framework where semantic knowledge scaffolds episodic encoding, which in turn favours compositional abstraction.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

The structured rehabilitation alone was ineffective in improving function whereas complex housing did improve performance on several measures. FGF-2 alone was ineffective but in combination with either the rehabilitation training or complex housing it did provide functional benefit. The combination of complex housing and FGF-2 was most effective as all motor measures showed significant improvement. Golgi analysis of layer III cortical pyramidal neurons showed that the complex housing essentially reversed the dendritic loss in the lesion animals. Curiously, there was no effect of FGF-2 on the cells measured, even though there was a beneficial effect of the combined FGF-2 and complex housing.

M.; Ranson, A.", "abstract": "Binocular rivalry arises when incongruent images are presented to the two eyes, producing stochastic alternations in perceptual dominance. While rivalry has been extensively studied in species with highly developed binocular vision, it is unclear whether similar representational dynamics occur in the mouse, a model system that allows large-scale cellular and circuit-level measurements. Here we used two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice to examine the population dynamics of primary visual cortex (V1) and long-range feedback axons from retrosplenial cortex (RSC) during presentation of dichoptically incongruent drifting gratings and natural movies. At the single-cell level, incongruent stimulation increased trial-to-trial variability of visually evoked responses relative to monocular stimulation. Linear SVM decoders trained on monocular responses revealed that during prolonged incongruent stimulation, V1 population activity alternated stochastically between representations of the two competing stimuli in a contrast-dependent manner. Decoder confidence was independent of pupil-indexed arousal state suggesting the dynamics observed may depend mostly on feedforward mechanisms. Transition analyses showed that switches in decoder output were typically driven by the emergence of responses to the ipsilateral stimulus, consistent with release from suppression of the non-dominant population. During incongruent presentation of natural movies, similar representational alternations were observed, indicating that rivalry-like dynamics were not dependent on orientation-selective adaptation. Imaging of RSC[-&gt;]V1 feedback axons revealed retinotopically specific, eye and orientation-selective signals that also alternated in dominance across time. These results establish the mouse as a model of rivalry-like cortical dynamics, demonstrate that both feedforward and feedback circuits contribute to representational alternation during binocular conflict, and provide a framework for mechanistic dissection of bistable perception.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

We synthesized a series of pregn-5-ene and androst-5-ene derivatives (11-23) and evaluated their positive allosteric modulator (PAM) activity on recombinant rat GluN1/GluN2B receptors via patch-clamp in HEK293 cells.

Evidence demonstrates that loss of entropy is a generic feature of pathological dynamics in the brain, including the ictal state. However, the impact of recurrent seizures on entropy in the interictal state remains unknown. Methods: Resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) scans and resection masks of 32 individuals with epilepsy who had Engel I outcome post-surgery were retrospectively retrieved. Using co-registered FreeSurfer parcellations, we reconstructed the source localised MEG time series and computed sample entropy for 114 regions of interest. We then tested the association of entropy with the resected volume of the brain, and additional clinical variables including the age of seizure onset, seizure frequency and duration of epilepsy. To further understand the temporal relationship between seizure onset and entropy in the interictal state, we collected and computed sample entropy for week-long EEG traces from leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 monoclonal antibody (LGI1-mAb) rodent models of autoimmune encephalitis (n=5) and control rats (n=5). Results: In individuals with epilepsy, a lower age of seizure onset was associated with lower mean sample entropy of the whole cortex (Spearmans rho =0.60, p<0.001; partial correlation =0.41, p=0.021). Entropy did not differ between the resected and non-resected regions of the brain. Furthermore, LGI1-mAb treated rodents showed a persistent decrease in sample entropy as compared to control rats, after the onset of seizures, and this difference was greatest during periods of highest seizure frequency (p<0.001). Conclusion: Recurrent seizures are associated with a persistent decrease in entropy, even in the interictal state, and this decrease was found to be most profound and affecting the whole cortex in patients who had a lower age of seizure onset.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

While tau is thought to spread along brain networks, the role of inter-individual variability in shaping these patterns remains underexplored. Using resting-state fMRI and tau- PET from 805 participants across the AD continuum, we studied whether subject-specific functional connectivity (FC) profiles enhance the characterization of tau deposition patterns. A hybrid approach integrating individual and group- average FC outperformed both alone, particularly in symptomatic individuals and at finer spatial resolutions, the latter underscoring a critical but often overlooked role of spatial scale. Individualized FC also better captured individual tau topographies than canonical tau-PET maps derived from cohort-level data. These effects were specific to tau, and not seen for {beta}-amyloid, and their predictive power increased with spatial granularity. Furthermore, baseline FC also predicted future tau accumulation at the individual level, supporting its prognostic value. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that individual functional brain architecture shapes tau propagation in humans, supporting the network spread hypothesis by showing that variability in connectivity translates into heterogeneity in tau distribution. This work advances biological understanding of tau propagation in AD, highlighting functional connectivity as a mechanistic substrate that supports prognostic assessment of tau trajectories.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

However, relatively little is known about how cholesterol affects other aspects of the viral replication cycle. Here, using an infection model focused on reactivation from latency, we demonstrate that depleting intracellular cholesterol inhibits the production of infectious Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) virions. Treatment of latently infected cells with the liver X receptor  (LXR) agonist 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22OH) increased expression of sterol response genes, including the cholesterol efflux pump ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), and triggered lytic reactivation and sharp reductions in the levels of intracellular cholesterol. Using a proteomics approach, by late stages of replication, we observed diminished viral protein accumulation and significant alterations in host protein expression, including proteins regulating the cell cycle and innate immune responses. Cholesterol poor conditions led to the accumulation of defective capsids in the nucleus and a reduction in viral particles accessing the cytoplasm. This effect on viral egress suggested functional defects in the conserved herpesvirus nuclear egress complex (NEC), comprised of two viral proteins that accumulate at the inner nuclear membrane and facilitate primary envelopment. We investigated the effects of 22OH on herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication and NEC protein trafficking. We found that 22OH inhibited HSV1 and HSV2 replication and spread in plaque reduction assays and impaired recruitment of NEC proteins UL31 and UL34 to the nuclear periphery. Taken together, these findings indicate that cholesterol efflux inhibits herpesvirus replication by interfering with nuclear egress.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

The composition and dynamics of cellular membranes are impacted by the underlying cytoskeleton. Zyxin, a cytosolic protein that bridges the actin cytoskeleton with adhesion receptor proteins, was recently identified as an antiviral factor that antagonizes HSV-1 entry. To determine if zyxin specifically interferes with membrane fusion, we examined its impact in a quantitative cell-cell fusion assay. HSV-1 entry proteins exhibited enhanced fusion activity with retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells when the cells were knocked out (KO) for zyxin. Zyxin-KO cells also showed enhanced fusion activity with pseudorabies virus (PRV), paramyxovirus and rhabdovirus fusion proteins. Additionally, the size of plaques formed following infection with members of each viral family were increased in the absence of zyxin. Bulk RNA sequencing of wild-type (WT) and zyxin- KO RPE cells identified 18 genes that enrich into several ontology groups of interest, including regulation of membrane potential, herpes simplex virus 1 infection (CCL2 and ZNF14), NABA core matrisome (CCL2 and ZNF14), extracellular matrix organization (CTSK, SERPINE1 and TGFB2), cell-cell adhesion (RAC2 and TGFB2), anchoring fibril formation, and regulation of the MAPK cascade (ACKR3 and TGFB2).

Control relies on flukicides, most of which are adulticides, with only triclabendazole effective against the pathogenic migratory juvenile. Classical neurotransmitter pathways are widely targeted by anthelmintics yet remain underexplored for flukicide development. Here we explore the importance of serotonin (5-HT) signaling in juvenile fluke. In silico analyses confirmed all F. hepatica life stages express a complete 5-HT signaling pathway encompassing genes encoding proteins for 5-HT synthesis, transport, and reuptake, as well as five putative 5-HT G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Homology and binding motif analyses supported the presence of two 5-HT1 (Fh5HT1A, Fh5HT1B) and three 5-HT7 (Fh5HT7A, -7B, -7C) GPCRs. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed widespread neuronal expression of 5-HT, its synthetic enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (FhTPH), and the GPCR Fh5HT7C. 5-HT addition stimulated juvenile fluke motility; consistent with this observation, serotonin reuptake inhibition, which causes 5-HT persistence at synaptic junctions, also enhanced juvenile movement. Silencing of FhTPH, a key enzyme in 5-HT synthesis, blunted juvenile motility, a phenotype reversed by the addition of 5-HT. Silencing the fluke vesicular monoamine transporter (FhVMAT), which packages 5-HT into synaptic vesicles, reduced juvenile motility, whilst silencing the 5-HT reuptake transporter (FhSERT) which recycles synaptic 5-HT increased juvenile motility and growth, consistent with 5-HT accumulation enhancing effects. Whilst combinatorial silencing of Fh5HT1 receptors reduced fluke motility, silencing Fh5HT7 receptors led to a greater reduction in motility. Exogenous addition of 5-HT partially rescued motility deficits of juveniles with silenced Fh5HT1 receptors, but 5-HT excitation was abolished in Fh5HT7-RNAi juveniles, exposing their importance to fluke motility. Notably, sustained 5-HT exposure promoted juvenile growth, but these effects were not blunted by receptor-RNAi. The findings emphasize a central role of serotonin signaling in both juvenile motility and growth, exposing novel aspects of receptor function and encouraging therapeutic exploitation for liver fluke control.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

While a hierarchical gene regulatory network (GRN) describing signaling pathways and transcription factors underpinning the establishment of definitive neural crest cells has been generated by integrating the work of numerous groups, much remains to be learned about the relationships of distinct GRN components to each other. Here, we use high-resolution fluorescent in situ Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR-FISH) to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural crest gene expression in Xenopus laevis embryos. We find that the onset of snai2, sox8, and foxd3 expression during late gastrulation is broad, heterogeneous, and partially overlapping, with distinct anterior-posterior and medio-lateral biases. By neurulation, these markers converge on a shared neural crest domain but retain relative expression differences along axial levels that persist into migratory stages, producing stream-specific gene expression patterns. Computational surface mapping revealed that these differences correlate with dynamic, layered expression of NPB factors, particularly pax3 and zic1. Correlating relative intensities of pax3 and zic1 with the presence or absence of nascent neural crest transcripts predicts that these NPB factors can differentially regulate snai2 and sox8, which we confirm with functional experiments. Strikingly, later stages show an inverse correlation between neural crest and NPB gene expression, suggesting a handoff mechanism in which pax3 and zic1 initially promote neural crest gene activation but are downregulated as neural crest identity emerges and contribute to combinatorial signatures of gene expression along the A-P axis.

Therefore, identifying temporal trends in mosquito abundance and areas conducive to their proliferation is essential for public health preparedness and response planning. This study aims to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus populations in Miami-Dade County, Florida. We analyzed eight years (2017-2024) of mosquito surveillance data from 308 mosquito traps operating across the county. We characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of female Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus and identified persistent areas of high mosquito abundance (hotspots) using local spatial analysis. A total of 399,418 Ae. aegypti and 1,250,879 Cx. quinquefasciatus were collected. The two species showed distinct and opposing seasonal patterns: Ae. aegypti abundance peaked during the summer wet season, whereas Cx. quinquefasciatus peaked in the winter dry season. Our analysis identified spatially consistent hotspots for both species, with some traps classified as hotspots in over half the years studied. The consistent seasonality of the two species and detection of hotspot areas across years provides operational value for long-term monitoring, evaluation of control interventions, and targeted resource allocation.

Apoa1bp knockout in APP/PS1 mice exacerbates microgliosis, increases amyloid plaque burden, neuronal cell loss, and reduces survival at 6 months. Although APOA1BP mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in humans, its cell-type-specific distribution in the brain remains unclear.

Using GFAP and IBA1 to label astrocytes and microglia, respectively, we found that AIBP protein was highly expressed in astrocytes, but not in microglia. Stratification of subjects by Braak stage (I-II, III-IV, V-VI) revealed a progressive decline in astrocytic AIBP expression with advancing AD pathology. Meta-analysis of RNA-seq profiling indicated enriched Apoa1bp expression in adult mouse astrocytes. Systemic Apoa1bp knockout in the APP/PS1 mouse exacerbated astrogliosis.

K.", "abstract": "Of the 2.8 million individuals who seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year, nearly 300,000 require hospitalization, with up to 60% of these needing intensive care. Intensive care treatment of TBI involves stressful events such as sleep disruption, noise, and painful procedures, potentially leading to chronic stress in patients undergoing such treatment. Given that physiologic stress can exacerbate neuroinflammation and impair normal neural function, we hypothesized that chronic variable stress (CVS) following TBI would exacerbate behavioral and pathological outcomes. We tested this hypothesis by subjecting adolescent male mice to blunt TBI, followed by two weeks of CVS or control conditions. We assessed brain pathologic responses to injury 2-, 5-, 20-, and 28-weeks post-injury. We found chronic optic tract degeneration by Fluoro-jade B staining in TBI groups. Unexpectedly, CVS+TBI mice did not show evidence of optic tract axon degeneration 20 weeks after injury, but did at the other time points. CVS led to increased microglial phagocytic markers early after injury, regardless of TBI status, and TBI led to increased microglial phagocytic markers in a delayed fashion as well. Notably, microglial phagocytosis markers were not elevated in TBI+CVS groups compared to TBI only groups 20 weeks post-injury. There was no effect of TBI or CVS on behavioral measures taken at the end of CVS. These findings suggest a delayed, but not permanent, protective effect on axonal degeneration after TBI, potentially related to altered microglial and astrocytic phagocytic activity.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

H.; Liou, J.-y.", "abstract": "Introduction: Seizures are traditionally attributed to excessive excitation or deficient inhibition, yet recent clinical and slice data show they can also paradoxically arise when inhibition outweighs excitation. We chemogenetically suppressed neocortical glutamatergic neurons to test whether such suppression elicits epileptic activity in vivo. Methods: CaMKII-driven Gi-coupled hM4Di or Gq-coupled hM3Dq Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADDs) were expressed in cortical glutamatergic neurons of Rasgrf2-jGCaMP8m and wildtype C57BL/6J mice. Widefield calcium imaging and 32-channel transparent electrocorticography were performed before and after systemic clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 1.25 ~ 5 mg/kg). Results: DREADD activation induced intermittent, large-amplitude, synchronized calcium transients confined to the CaMKII-hM4Di focus, accompanied by focal ECoG spikes that persisted for >3 h and sometimes evolved into seizures. By contrast, CNO activation of excitatory neurons via CaMKII-hM3Dq DREADDs desynchronized activity without epileptiform discharges. The same process duplicated in wild-type animals provoked similar epileptiform discharges. Conclusion: Selective suppression of excitation can paradoxically drive cortical networks into hypersynchronous, epileptic states, challenging the simple excess-excitation model of ictogenesis. These findings highlight that seizures may result from relative inhibitory dominance, and that considering this excess inhibition mechanism could inspire new therapeutic approaches.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

A central unresolved question, however, is whether lipidomic signatures identified in accessible peripheral biofluids faithfully recapitulate the pathogenic alterations within the central nervous system (CNS). This gap impedes the development of reliable biomarkers and constrains a comprehensive understanding of PD pathophysiology. To address this challenge, we employed a cross-species lipidomic approach. We modeled PD in both male and female mice by injecting human -synuclein preformed fibrils into the substantia nigra. Three months post-injection, lipidomic profiles of the midbrain and plasma were generated and compared. These findings were further validated in plasma from male and female PD patients and age-matched controls, enabling the identification of conserved alterations. We identified shared dysregulation of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and fatty acids in the brains and plasma of diseased mice as well as in plasma from PD patients. Notably, lipids associated with lipid droplet biogenesis, including triacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols, were elevated in diseased mouse brains and patient plasma. These alterations coincided with a marked accumulation of lipid droplets in the mouse midbrain and were further corroborated by increased lipid droplet abundance in macrophages derived from PD patients. Interestingly, lipid droplet accumulation exhibited sex-specific patterns: male mice displayed greater microglial accumulation, whereas female mice showed enhanced neuronal deposition. Together, these findings demonstrate that peripheral lipidomic signatures reflect CNS pathology in PD, highlighting new opportunities for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, sex-specific lipid droplet accumulation in innate immune cells and neurons implicates these pathways as mechanistic contributors to PD and underscores the necessity of sex-stratified strategies in biomarker discovery and disease modeling.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Unlike first-order thalamic regions which are known to primarily relay sensory signals to the neocortex, the functions of HO thalamic nuclei remain far less clear. Although previous studies indicate HO thalamic nuclei influence cortical processing and consciousness, most studies examined single nuclei in isolation. To investigate the effect of conscious state across nuclei, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) across multiple thalamic nuclei in awake and anesthetized mice during sensory stimulation. The effect of voluntary locomotion was also studied in the awake state. Surprisingly, we found that LFP traces were strongly correlated across HO nuclei in both states, which cannot be explained by volume conduction alone, suggesting the existence of shared synaptic inputs. Anesthesia significantly reduced MUA across HO nuclei, while in the awake state locomotion and sensory stimuli activated many nuclei, including those that have not classically been regarded as sensory or motor. Moreover, we found that sensory responses of HO nuclei depended on the sensory modality and conscious state of the animal.

Q.; Machado, M. C.", "abstract": "The hippocampal formation and adjacent parahippocampal areas are central to intelligent behaviour such as memory and navigation. Understanding how systems in the brain generate structured representations from experience remains a fundamental goal in neuroscience. A central open question is whether a single computational principle can account for the diverse neural responses observed across the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit. Existing models often rely on hand-crafted features or specialized learning mechanisms unrelated to sensory observations, and typically express representations of only a small subset of known cell types. Further, representations learned in such models are often not empirically evaluated against neural representations observed in the navigating brain. Here, we introduce a neurobiologically-inspired and robust computational model in which diverse cell types emerge from a single learning objective with minimal hand-engineered assumptions. Our model applies contrastive graph representation learning to transitions between high-dimensional visual observations, constructing a metric space in which temporally adjacent sensory observations are mapped to nearby states. Inspired by the anatomical information flow of the hippocampal-entorhinal system, and anchored in output representations based on neural coding in the entorhinal cortex, the model gives rise to activity resembling place cells, grid cells, boundary vector cells, band cells, corner cells, and conjunctive cells among others. Across varied environments and sensory streams, the framework captures not only diverse neural response patterns but also the functional dependencies between them, mirroring the proposed sequential representational structure observed in the hippocampal-entorhinal system. Crucially, place-cell-like features of the model quantitatively reproduce remapping dynamics observed in CA1 of freely moving animals, and afford theoretical explanatory power of existing neurobiologically-informed models. This work thus offers a unified computational model of spatial coding in the hippocampal-entorhinal system and a testable framework for generating mechanistic hypotheses in silico, to be evaluated in vivo.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

This coordination is inherently challenging for the brain. Effective coordination of multiple joints relies on intact feedforward control to predict movement dynamics in the initial phase of the movement, and on feedback control to fine-tune the execution in the final phase. However, the effect of aging on these specific control mechanisms remains controversial. In our experiment we investigated a pure elbow motion task using the KINARM exoskeleton. A group of 50 young (20-35 years old), 80 old (55-70 years old) and 30 older-old (80+ years old) healthy participants were recruited. Each participant performed 30deg elbow rotations while stabilizing the shoulder joint. Movements were directed toward two distinct targets in both flexion and extension directions. The task was performed under two controlled speed conditions to maximally challenge the motor system, as higher elbow velocities increase interaction torques at the shoulder, demanding greater neuromuscular effort for stabilization. The timing and magnitude of anticipatory EMG activity of the agonist shoulder muscle, necessary to counteract interaction torques, were preserved across all age groups. Moreover, increasing elbow velocity did not result in any performance differences between young and older old adults, indicating that shoulder stabilization during movement initiation remained intact with age. However, older adults exhibited reduced ability to stabilize the shoulder position until the end of the movement, leading to decreased reaching accuracy with older age. These results suggest that feedforward control, essential for movement planning, which is essential for shoulder stabilization during initiation, is preserved during healthy aging and remains resilient to increased motor demands, even in older old adults. In contrast, feedback control appears to deteriorate with age, potentially contributing to reduced movement precision in the final phase of the multi-joint movement.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

While such overlap supports generalization and abstraction, it also increases interference and threatens representational stability. Here we introduce Homeostatic Binary Networks (HBNs), a minimal recurrent framework that combines binary activity, adjustable inhibition, Hebbian learning, and homeostatic plasticity to address these challenges. First, we formalize an Episode Generation Protocol (EGP) that creates compositional episodes with controllable overlap and noise, and define a corresponding semantic structure as conditional probabilities between concepts. We then show analytically and through simulations that recurrent synapses converge to conditional firing probabilities, thereby encoding asymmetric semantic relationships across concepts. These recurrent dynamics enable reliable recall and replay of overlapping episodes without representational collapse. Finally, by incorporating feed-forward plasticity with a neuronal maturity mechanism, output neurons form selective receptive fields in a one-shot manner and refine them through replay, yielding robust unsupervised classification of overlapping episodes. Together, our results demonstrate how simple principles such as neural and synaptic competition can support the stable representation and organization of overlapping memories, providing a mechanistic bridge between episodic and semantic structure in memory systems.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to estimate trial-wise learning rate, predicted conflict level, and prediction error, providing computational indices of cognitive control flexibility. Neural correlation analysis revealed that these variables correlated with Theta, Alpha, and Beta oscillations in distinct brain regions. Connectivity analysis among these regions indicated enhanced cross-frequency directional interactions triggered by stimuli. Furthermore, connections reflecting updates to predicted conflict level prior to stimulus onset indexed individual strength in proactive control, while connections reflecting learning rate updates after stimulus onset indexed reactive control.

Sleep and circadian disruption have been linked to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation and neuroinflammation, but whether dim light at night (dLAN) modifies these processes remains unclear. We tested whether chronic dLAN exposure (8 lux during the dark phase, 8 weeks) alters circadian rhythms, amyloid pathology, and neuroinflammation in 12-13 month-old humanized APP knock-in (KI) mice. hAPPSAA KI mice, which develop plaques, were compared with hAPPWT KI controls carrying only a humanized APP sequence. dLAN reduced circadian rhythm amplitude and stability while increasing fragmentation in both genotypes within two weeks. In hAPPSAA KI mice, dLAN modestly increased hippocampal plaque burden and soluble neocortical A{beta}. Astrocyte reactivity was elevated by genotype but not altered by nighttime light exposure. In contrast, microglial markers (CD45, MHCII) were increased with dLAN with CD45+ area elevated in hippocampus, and MHCII+ cell counts greater in the cortex and hippocampus of hAPPSAA KI mice. There were also distinct spatial responses between the microglia markers suggesting that dLAN primes microglia toward an antigen-presenting phenotype (MHCII) in the presence of A{beta}. Yet, the microglia/macrophage priming was not associated with amplified cytokine or chemokine levels at the 8-week dLAN exposure timepoint in the brain. These findings add to growing evidence that nighttime light exposure can disrupt circadian and immune regulation, and suggest that environmental light pollution should be further explored as a modifiable factor contributing to Alzheimer's disease progression.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Ageing is typically associated with enhanced emotion regulation, including greater differentiation of affective states and a shift toward positivity. Whether SVD disrupts these resilience mechanisms before overt clinical impairment is unknown. Methods Eighty-two adults were studied: young (n=22) and middle-aged (n=23) adults without brain abnormalities, and middle-aged adults with early SVD (n=37). Participants completed an ecologically grounded social emotion fMRI paradigm and self-report questionnaires of interoceptive and emotional awareness. Group differences in emotional differentiation, positivity, and neurovisceral integration were analysed to assess the effects of healthy ageing and early SVD. Results Compared with young adults, middle-aged adults without SVD showed preserved emotional differentiation, positivity bias, and intact neurovisceral integration. In contrast, early SVD was associated with reduced emotional differentiation, loss of the age-related positivity effect, and altered insular encoding of arousal. Impaired neurovisceral integration translated into diminished heart rate adaptation during sustained emotional processing. Self-report alexithymia ratings and interoceptive profiles further indicated reduced emotional awareness and embodied self-regulation in adults with SVD. These effects persisted after adjustment for cognition, cardiovascular risk factors, depression, and anxiety. Conclusions Early SVD is associated with affective-interoceptive disintegration evident across behavioural, neural, and physiological levels. Altered embodied regulation of emotion may constitute an early marker of vascular brain injury and a target for preventative interventions.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

While the mechanisms underlying toxin-mediated acute diarrhea are known, the molecular events involved in ETEC-related sequelae remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) profoundly remodels intestinal epithelial composition and function through modulation of WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling. Using human ileal enteroids, we demonstrate that LT stabilizes {beta}-catenin independently of WNT ligands, promotes its nuclear accumulation, and enhances TCF/LEF-driven transcription. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses reveal that LT increases intestinal proliferation by enhancing cell cycle activity across all epithelial lineages, thus disrupting epithelial composition by expanding proliferative progenitor populations at the expense of absorptive enterocytes. Simultaneously, LT impairs epithelial maturation and suppresses transcriptional programs required for nutrient absorption and differentiation. Together, these findings identify LT as a potent driver of intestinal epithelial reprogramming, providing mechanistic insight into how ETEC infection may drive long-term consequences beyond acute diarrhea and may inform strategies to prevent major sequelae, including malnutrition, that affect millions of children worldwide.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that the main function of mtETC in blood stage Plasmodium falciparum is to regenerate ubiquinone, which serves as an obligatory co-substrate of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), an essential mitochondrial enzyme for pyrimidine biosynthesis. P. falciparum can be rendered resistant to all mtETC inhibitors by provision of a bypass mediated by cytosolic yeast DHOD, a fumarate-reducing enzyme. Malaria parasite mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes only 3 proteins, each a component of mtETC. However, attempts to eliminate mtDNA in transgenic parasites expressing yDHOD have been unsuccessful, suggesting the possibility that essential function(s) other than the canonical redox reactions of the mtETC also require mtDNA maintenance. Here we have tested the hypothesis that Complex III serves the dual functions of processing imported mitochondrial proteins, as well as ubiquinone regeneration. We have generated transgenic lines that conditionally express mitochondrial processing peptidase a (MPP), which is also a component of Complex III. Using these parasites, we have determined that MPP is essential even when the need for mitochondrial electron transport is bypassed. MPP knockdown also resulted in hypersensitivity of the parasites to proguanil, a drug that synergizes with mtETC inhibitors such as atovaquone. Pulldown with MPP followed by proteomics revealed the association of multiple mitochondrially targeted proteins, in addition to all components of Complex III. These results are consistent with the suggestion that Complex III in P. falciparum serves both mtETC and protein processing functions in mitochondrial physiology.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Examples of opportunistic pathogens that disrupt the intestinal barrier and contribute to microbial imbalance in the gastrointestinal tract include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. This study evaluated the in vitro effectiveness of a bacteriophage cocktail composed of three host-specific phages: Lilla1 targeting Klebsiella pneumoniae, PAE1 targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Smarc1 targeting Serratia marcescens. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm, and phage replication was quantified by plaque-forming unit assays. Each phage exhibited strong host specificity and produced significant reduction of growth of the corresponding bacterium while increasing in concentration during incubation. When applied as a cocktail, these three phages produced stronger and more sustained suppression of bacterial growth than single-phage treatments, both in individual cultures and in mixed cultures containing all three pathogens. In mixed cultures, continuous inhibition of bacterial growth persisted throughout a 24-hour incubation, and concentrations of Lilla1, PAE1 and Smarc1 increased significantly, indicating active replication and enhanced efficacy in combination. In single bacterial growth assays, bacterial populations that were initially suppressed showed regrowth after extended incubation. Regrowth manifested as a renewed increase in optical density several hours after initial decline and is consistent with selection of phage-resistant subpopulations, potentially arising from modification of surface receptors, phase variation or activation of adaptive defence systems. The observed biphasic response highlights the need for measures to limit microbial resistance to phage treatment, including expanded phage cocktails, adjusted dosing strategies and combined phage-antibiotic regimens. The results demonstrate that a three-phage cocktail can simultaneously inhibit multiple bacterial pathogens associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction and provide a basis for further in vivo evaluation and therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Bats' preference for the lit exit increased prior to sunset, then switched back to preferring darkness only near sunrise. This behaviour contrasts with that of previously studied cave-dwelling bats. Irrespective of their exit choice, bats used echolocation in all trials, consistent with a multimodal sensory strategy in which light conveys critical environmental information beyond the range of echolocation, but not replacing it. However, light governed the time-dependent shift in exit selection. The circadian shifts in light/dark preference are consistent with two hypotheses related to navigation mechanisms and stopover behaviour: Preference for light cues may facilitate compass calibration mechanisms, whereas the dawn preference for darkness likely reflects roost-searching and predator avoidance. These findings underscore the integral role of vision in bat navigation and highlight how circadian rhythms modulate photic responses in a migratory context. Such insights are essential for designing wildlife-friendly lighting and for interpreting future multi-sensory experiments, including those probing bat magnetoreception, where natural photic responses must be taken into account.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Using both cachectic and non-cachectic tumor models in Drosophila, we observed that fat body-derived hexamerins accumulate in the tumors through a selective uptake process. Disabling this uptake led to a marked reduction in tumor growth, demonstrating that hexamerins are used as a nutrient source to support cancer progression. Hexamerin uptake also supports expression of the relaxin-like Dilp8 by the tumor, inhibiting ecdysone production and extending the growth period. This coupling between nutrient uptake by the tumor and inhibition of the developmental progression exerts a full diversion of the host resources. Functional parallels with mammalian albumins suggest evolutionarily conserved mechanisms with potential implications for cancer biology.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

The neurotrophic factor BDNF also decreases in the aging brain. We hypothesized that BDNF regulates the homeostasis of cerebral pericytes and microvasculature. We used differently aged C57BL/6J mice, and C57BL6 mice with conditional knockout of Bdnf gene. Collagen IV-positive microvessels and PDGFR{beta}-positive pericytes in the brain were counted after immunological staining. Pericytes were also quantified by Western blot of PDGFR{beta} and CD13 in isolated cerebral microvessels. The level of BDNF and TrkB phosphorylation was determined in brain homogenates. To demonstrate the direct effect of BDNF on pericytes, TrkB and pericytes were co-stained in brain tissue, single-cell sequencing and transcriptomic analysis were used to identify and characterize Ntrk2-expressing pericytes, and TrkB was also detected in the pericyte cell line by Western blot. Cultured pericytes were further treated with recombinant BDNF in the presence and absence of an Akt inhibitor and examined for PDGFR{beta} expression. The length and branching of microvessels and pericytes decreased in conjunction with the reduction in mature BDNF and TrkB phosphorylation in aging brains. Deficiency of BDNF in neurons or astrocytes was sufficient to reduce cerebral microvessels, PDGFR{beta} and CD13 concentrations and Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in isolated blood vessels. A subset of pericytes in the brain and cultured pericytes expressed TrkB. BDNF treatment increased PDGFR{beta} expression along with Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in cultured cells. The effect of BDNF on PDGFR{beta} expression was abolished by treatment with Akt inhibitor. Therefore, BDNF induces the expression of PDGFR{beta} and CD13 by activating Akt signaling in pericytes, promoting the homeostasis of pericytes and microvasculature in the aging brain. Our study identified a BDNF-mediated mechanism that regulates microvascular integrity in the aged brain.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

M.; Sussillo, D.", "abstract": "The computation-through-dynamics perspective argues that biological neural circuits process information via the continuous evolution of their internal states. Inspired by this perspective, Latent Factor Activity using Dynamical systems (LFADS, Pandarinath et al., 2018) identifies a generative model consistent with the neural activity recordings. LFADS models neural dynamics with a recurrent neural network (RNN) generator, which results in excellent fit to the data. However, it has been difficult to understand the dynamics of the LFADS generator. In this work, we show that this poor interpretability arises in part because the generator implements complex, multi-stable dynamics. We introduce a simple modification to LFADS that ameliorates issues with interpretability by providing an inferred per-trial bias (modeled as a constant input) to the RNN generator, enabling it to contextually adapt a simpler dynamical system to individual trials. In both simulated neural recordings from pendulum oscillations and real recordings during arm movements in nonhuman primates, we observed that the standard LFADS learned complex, multi-stable dynamics, whereas the modified LFADS learned easier-to-understand contextual dynamics. This enabled direct analysis of the generator, which reproduced at a single-trial level previous results shown only through more complex analyses at the trial average. Finally, we applied the per-trial inferred bias LFADS model to human intracortical brain computer interface recordings during attempted finger movements and speech. We show that modifying neural dynamics using linear operations of the per-trial bias addresses non-stationarity and identifies the extent of behavioral variability, problems known to plague BCI. We call our modification to LFADS as \"contextual LFADS\".", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

These clinical fluctuations are accompanied by widespread functional disruptions in the brain. However, the shared and individual specific neural mechanisms across distinct episodes of BD remain poorly understood. Methods: We analyzed resting state fMRI data from 190 participants (BD patients in four episodes and healthy controls) using edge centric functional connectomes (eFC), which capture time resolved cofluctuations between brain regions. A common orthogonal basis extraction (COBE) algorithm was applied to decompose individual eFC matrices into shared and individual specific subspaces. We characterized the spatial topology, genetic relevance, and circuit level correlates of the shared component. Dynamic properties (entropy, identifiability) and symptom prediction models were assessed using entropy metrics, intraclass correlation coefficients, and support vector regression. Results: The shared eFC pattern was stable across participants, aligned with the sensory association gradient, and exhibited significant heritability and test retest reliability . Entropy of individual loadings increased with illness duration and was significantly elevated in BD, particularly in mBD. Microcircuit modeling revealed that this shared pattern was inversely related to external input strength , indicating intrinsic network dominance. mBD was associated with globally elevated eFC entropy and markedly reduced fingerprint stability. Symptom severity (HDRS, YMRS, HAMA) was significantly predicted from individual network topographies across BD phases, highlighting clinically meaningful dynamic signatures. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that BD episodes are underpinned by a conserved functional scaffold and distinct individual specific neural fingerprints. Edge centric dynamics especially those derived from individual specific decompositions offer robust biomarkers for mood state characterization and symptom severity, and may facilitate future personalized interventions in BD.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we provide a region-specific transcriptomic map of the hippocampus in MRL/Lpr mice --a validated NPSLE model-- compared to MRL+/+ controls. Bulk RNA-seq combined with integrative analyses (e.g. differential expression, GSEA, WGCNA, cell-type deconvolution) uncovered a robust disease-specific signature centered on oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelination failure. Key myelin-related genes (Mbp, Plp1, Mog) and lineage-defining transcription factors (Sox10, Nkx6-2, Olig2) were repressed, while OPC markers remained unchanged, indicating a maturation blockade rather than lineage loss. Gene set enrichment highlighted widespread suppression of oligodendrocyte differentiation, axon ensheathment, and Wnt/retinoic acid signaling, alongside dysregulation of extracellular matrix components critical for axo-glial interactions. Co-expression network analysis revealed a disease-associated module enriched in myelination programs, with hub genes spanning structural, transcriptional, and adhesion-related functions. Deconvolution analysis confirmed a selective reduction of mature oligodendrocytes, contrasting with preserved neuronal populations and absence of classical astroglial or microglial activation signatures. RT-qPCR and Western blot validated the repression of myelination pathways at both mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, these findings challenge the inflammation-centric paradigm of NPSLE, revealing a cell-intrinsic vulnerability of the oligodendrocyte lineage. This conceptual shift --from immune-driven damage to impaired glial development-- redefines NPSLE pathogenesis and suggests novel therapeutic avenues targeting oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination rather than focusing solely on immunosuppression.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

We characterized each neurons trial-averaged peri-event activity with interpretable metrics and mapped these response properties across areas, revealing large-scale spatial structure. Neuronal response profiles often shifted abruptly at anatomical borders: motor areas showed sharper tuning and more linear relationships with target location, whereas somatosensory areas displayed more heterogeneous response patterns. Neural response properties also differed according to somatotopic representation. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction of the neural feature matrix revealed that areas varied in their average response profiles, but also that each area contained subpopulations. Neurons in each subpopulation had characteristic response profiles and were distributed across multiple cortical areas. The spatial distributions of the subpopulations overlapped, with neurons from different subpopulations salt-and-pepper intermingled in the overlap zones.

A consistent finding with this technique is large inter-individual variability regarding tracer propagation. In this study, we outline an approach which predicts the distribution of tracer in the parenchyma based only on geometric information from brain tissue as captured by MRI, addressing one possible explanation for this variability. Methods: Registrations are computed from pre-injection MRI, and used to map images at 24 hours after tracer injection to perform predictions of tracer enrichment in the parenchyma in other patients. We apply the method to a dataset of human brain MRI of 134 patients examined for different tentative diagnoses including idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, spontaneous intracranial hypotension and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, as well as a group of reference patients. Results: Tracer enrichment mapped between patients by image registration correlate strongly with actual observed enrichment. For patients in the reference group, the relative root mean squared error on our predictions is on average 26% in the gray matter, and 15% or less in other brain regions. Predictions are generally less reliable in the gray matter, and for patients with identified CSF leaks.

Here, we use hiPSC-derived neuronal networks containing both excitatory and inhibitory neurons to show that excessive bursting activity in DS cultures is driven by excitatory neurons.

Among them, Enterococcus faecalis is a major pathogen of surgical site incisional and of diabetic chronic wounds, but factors driving its colonization and persistence in wounds remain poorly understood. Iron, manganese, and zinc are essential cofactors in cellular processes, prompting the host to restrict their availability through mobilization of metal-sequestering proteins, a defense known as nutritional immunity. Previously, we showed that E. faecalis strains lacking key iron ({Delta}5Fe), manganese ({Delta}3Mn), or zinc ({Delta}2Zn) uptake systems have impaired virulence. Here, we used an excisional wound model in normoglycemic (C57Bl/6J or B6) and diabetic (C57Bl/6J lepR-/- or DB) mice to examine the role of these metal import systems in wounds. The strong upregulation of metal import genes and reduced wound colonization by {Delta}3Mn, {Delta}5Fe, and {Delta}2Zn strains in B6 mice indicate that iron, manganese, and zinc are limited during wound infection. While {Delta}2Zn and {Delta}3Mn strains showed no improved colonization in diabetic wounds, the {Delta}5Fe exhibited a temporary colonization advantage over non-diabetic mice. Quantifications of metal-sequestering proteins lactoferrin, transferrin, calprotectin and psoriasin from intact skin and infected wounds indicated that nutritional immunity, especially iron restriction, is delayed in diabetes.

We have created an integrated ratiometric calcium reporter that allows comparative analysis of calcium levels in germ cells. We observe a positive correlation between the rate of cell proliferation and calcium levels. Conditions that decrease proliferation decrease basal cytoplasmic calcium levels, these include starvation and loss of insulin, TGF-{beta}, and folate signaling. Conversely, overproliferating germline tumor cells have increased basal cytoplasmic calcium levels. To determine if basal calcium levels regulate the rate of proliferation, we decreased calcium levels by inactivating the TRPM7-related GON-2 calcium channel. A gon-2 null mutant has significantly decreased basal cytoplasmic calcium levels and germ cell proliferation. Partial reduction of GON-2 activity in a gon-2 mutant heterozygote also reduces calcium levels and proliferation, but to a lower extent. This identifies GON-2 as a calcium channel that is required to maintain basal cytoplasmic calcium levels in germ cells. Conversely, increasing basal cytoplasmic calcium levels in germ cells either by inhibiting the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (which transports cytoplasmic calcium out of cells) or by inhibiting the SERCA channel (which transports cytoplasmic calcium into the endoplasmic reticulum) increased basal calcium levels and germ cell proliferation. This study identifies the germ line as the first tissue in C. elegans whose rate of cell proliferation is regulated by calcium. While transient increases in calcium are associated with cell proliferation in many animal species, our study suggests that the basal level of cytoplasmic calcium acts as a rheostat to modulate the rate of C. elegans germ cell proliferation in response to physiological processes and signals.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Methods: We exposed Calu-3 airway epithelial cell cultures to PM2.5 (10, 50, and100 m/ml) and SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.01) for 24 h. The viability of Calu-3 cells and epithelial barrier integrity were determined using MTT assay and immunofluorescence staining for Zonula Occludens-1, respectively. mRNA expression for inflammatory and inflammasomal genes including interleukin (IL)-8, nuclear factor (NF)-kB p65 (RelA), JNK, c-JUN, Caspase-1 and NLRP3, and viral entry-related genes such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 and transmembrane protease, serine (TMPRSS)2 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Intracellular viral spike protein intensity and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) expression were determined using immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR, respectively. Inflammatory cytokine release was analyzed by ELISA. Results: Higher concentrations of 100g/ml PM2.5 decreased Calu-3 cell viability (p=0.02) and deteriorated epithelial barrier integrity, and 50 g/ml of PM2.5 (p<0.01) induced mRNA expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Although PM2.5 alone did not alter the expression of mRNA for JNK and RelA, a combination of SARS-CoV-2 and 50-100g/ml PM2.5 led to a significant increase in mRNA for both genes (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively).

However, the evolutionary history and likely effector gene remain unclear. We investigated signatures of historical selection at this locus and the mechanism by which it might influence COVID-19 severity. Using 1000 Genomes Project data from diverse global populations, we applied various selection scans methods and integrated it with functional analysis. Multiple, independent lines of evidence indicate strong positive selection at 3p21.31 in East Asians. The region exceeds the 99.99th-percentile PBS threshold in EAS, shows extended ROH and the slowest LD decay among populations, and exhibits reduced nucleotide diversity and significantly negative Tajima D, consistent with a selective sweep. XP-EHH identified a pronounced signal centred on LZTFL1. Marginal-tree reconstruction indicates the derived allele arose in modern humans and swept to high frequency in East Asia at a time consistent with an ancient corona or related virus-like epidemic ~20,000-25,000 (20-25 Kya) years ago. LD and pathway analyses implicate a high-LD haplotype tagging LZTFL1 shows significant enrichment for cilium-assembly and BBSome-mediated cargo-targeting pathways likely causing subtle shifts in cilium number or beat frequency, in lung and airway epithelia, thereby profoundly affecting the mucus and pathogens clearance. Based on the Overall observation, we propose that after the Neanderthal introgression, East Asia went through pathogen pressure for ~20-25 Kya old ancient coronavirus- or related virus epidemic leading to positive selection at 3p21.31locus.

Starting with large (~750 kb) yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)-based constructs limits the rampant multimerization that has complicated many prior types of HACs. Large YAC construction is accomplished using transformation-associated recombination (TAR) strategies that can become unwieldly when several functional modules are to be incorporated and tested. To address this issue, we developed an approach where modules are built using high-fidelity in vitro assembly strategies in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) format. Then, the assembled modules are transferred in a simplified TAR step into a recipient YAC harboring the prokaryotic stuffer DNA that comprises a large portion of the final HAC construct. This approach is highly efficient with two-thirds of all screened yeast clones harboring the correct TAR product. Further, whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing/alignments, de novo assembly of the final YAC using a single ONT sequencing run, and close inspection of highly repetitive regions are all streamlined to rapidly validate clones that match the design. The fully sequenced, verified strain harboring a multi-module construct was then fused to human cells, where it efficiently formed functional HACs upon initial seeding with CENP-A-containing nucleosomes. We envision that the rapid assembly steps will be useful to quickly incorporate different functional modules, including diverse genetic cargoes, to engineer HACs with specific design features.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

In arid and semi-arid regions, this tripartite relationship must withstand long periods of drought followed by brief periods of rainfall. In the present study, we employed a combination of RNA/DNA metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to provide insights into the functional capabilities and activity levels of the bacterial communities present in the bulk soil and rhizosphere samples of Pappostipa frigida, a grass species endemic to the Andean steppe of the Atacama Desert. Results The active bacterial community in the rhizosphere of P. frigida exhibited greater diversity and a higher Shannon index than the total bacterial community. In terms of beta diversity, the structures of the total and active communities differed markedly between the BS and the RZ. Furthermore, active bacteria in the RZ showed a stronger correlation with total bacterial populations than those in the BS. This finding is consistent with the low proportion of ASVs derived from RNA extractions detected in the BS. Notably, 64% of these putative inactive bacterial populations were identified as active RZ members and 73% grew in culture media, suggesting they were likely dormant. The bacterial communities of the BS exhibited higher abundances of sporulation genes. In contrast, active bacterial communities in the RZ consistently contained higher abundances of genes associated with halotolerance, siderophore synthesis, and resuscitation-promoting factors. Conclusions The results emphasize the importance of the conditions created by plants in recruiting bacterial populations from the soil and provide insights into how the rhizosphere of arid native plants influences the activity and functional traits of soil microorganisms in their natural habitat.

Here, we show that MreB does not stiffen the envelope directly, but instead mechanically couples the cell wall to the cytoplasmic membrane through its role in peptidoglycan synthesis, increasing resistance to bending. Under hyperosmotic stress, MreB relocalized to the poles, forming linkages that prevent membrane detachment from the cell wall and attenuate cytoplasmic contraction. Disruption of MreB filament formation, nutrient starvation, or inactivation of glycan elongation factors abolished or reduced this coupling, revealing that peptidoglycan biosynthesis actively mediates stress distribution across surface layers.

Embedded within the IMC are the apical annuli: 5-6 ring-shaped pores facilitating dense granule exocytosis. Here we describe a novel apical annuli protein, AAP7. AAP7 depletion causes a severe fitness defect. In stable AAP7-depleted (ATc-resistant) parasites, LMBD3 no longer traffics to the annuli, but accumulates among the secretory organelles. This suggests AAP7 is required to traffic LMDB3 to the plasma membrane through a novel route. Moreover, it indicated that AAP7 connects plasma membrane embedded LMDB3 to the AAP proteins embedded in the IMC sutures. Functionally, AAP7 depletion results in reduced secretion of dense granule proteins. Specifically, parasitophorous vacuole membrane pore forming GRA17 secretion is reduced, causing 'bubble' vacuoles. GRA17 overexpression overcomes AAP7 depletion and reduces bubble vacuoles revealing the critical defect. An additional AAP7 depletion phenotype is the accumulation of polyglutamylated SPMTs at the basal end, indicating slow turnover. Lastly, from a comparative angle, we investigated annuli in Sarcocystis neurona , revealing 6 apical annuli. This is surprising considering S. neurona 's 11 alveolar vesicles and expected 11 annuli. Ergo, annuli architecture does not take cues from IMC suture positioning. In summary, our analysis of AAP7 led to equally versatile and novel insights in apical annuli architecture, their assembly (uncovering a potentially novel trafficking process), how they interface with the IMC and impact the SPMTs, and their critical function in facilitating GRA17 secretion required for the pore across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Because our understanding of the mechanisms driving enhanced disease severity during co-infection is limited, we sought to evaluate how interactions with C. albicans regulate S. aureus virulence towards host cells. We determined that C. albicans enhances S. aureus cytotoxicity towards murine monocytes via a mechanism requiring the Agr system. Agr is a major regulator of S. aureus virulence factors and was previously shown to be activated by C. albicans, but the Agr-regulated virulence factors driving immune cell death are unknown. We identified that enhanced murine monocyte cell death requires the -type phenol soluble modulins and {gamma}-hemolysin. Because several S. aureus toxins have species-specific effects, we also tested how co-culture impacts cytotoxicity towards human monocytes. Unexpectedly, we discovered that C. albicans induces robust cytotoxicity of an S. aureus agr mutant ({Delta}agr), which is completely non-toxic towards murine monocytes. Using reporter strains and combinatorial mutants, we identified that co-culture activates the SaeRS regulatory system in S. aureus, and SaeRS is required for human-specific cytotoxicity. We further discovered that the SaeRS-regulated toxin Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) drives S. aureus {Delta}agr cytotoxicity following co-culture. Finally, we observed similar cytotoxicity phenotypes using both S. aureus and C. albicans clinical isolates, demonstrating broad conservation of this interaction. Interestingly, the magnitude by which C. albicans isolates induce cytotoxicity of S. aureus {Delta}agr varies among strains tested.

Here, we demonstrate that Aspergillus oryzae, the filamentous fungus used in soy sauce production, shares more recent ancestry with a predominantly northern, largely non-aflatoxigenic population of Aspergillus flavus (population C). Strikingly, A. oryzae isolates also overlap with the recently described, clinically enriched A. flavus population D, suggesting the possibility of multiple domestication events. Although A. oryzae exhibits reduced virulence compared to A. flavus, all isolates tested retained pathogenicity in a zebrafish infection model. At the transcriptomic level, Aspergillus populations are significantly differentiated, with distinct responses to population density, indicating that population-specific transcriptomes adapt differently to ecological conditions. These differences extend beyond gene content and are not always explained by phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that phenotypic diversification occurs through the rapid reorganization of transcriptomic architectures. For example, A. oryzae displays significantly elevated expression of a module enriched for carbohydrate metabolism. Population-specific variation is also evident among secondary metabolite (SM) gene clusters. While A. oryzae shows markedly reduced expression of specific SM genes, particularly those involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis, this trend does not extend across the entire secondary metabolome. Using machine-learning-based gene regulatory network inference, we identified population-specific transcriptomic differences linked to distinct transcription factors, with evidence for both cis- and trans-acting regulatory divergence, but no changes in global regulators such as laeA.

Currently, a single genome exists for the one formally described species in the genus, Bodo saltans. Previous studies on Bodo saltans have shown that it is dependent on an endosymbiotic bacterium from the order Holosporales, Candidatus Bodocaedibacter vickermanii. Using single cell-sequencing, we isolated, sequenced, and assembled genomes for seven uncultured Bodo spp. cells from a single freshwater sample from Royal Leamington Spa, UK. By using comparative genomics, we show that these seven cells represent three potentially novel Bodo species and exhibit unexpected levels of diversity at the genome level. Our results indicate that Small Subunit (SSU) rDNA sequencing, often used to classify Bodo flagellates, is insufficient for determining species delimitation in this genus. In addition, we recovered a Holosporales bacterium genome from all seven Bodo spp. cells.

This diversity would be indistinguishable in routinely-used SSU ribosomal DNA (rDNA) metabarcoding or bulk sequencing pipelines, thus demonstrating the utility of using single-cell sequencing to reveal the level of genomic diversity within lineages of microbial eukaryotes.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by gluten-derived peptides that resist gastrointestinal digestion, notably the proline-rich 33-mer and 11-mer gliadin epitopes. Here, we describe a rational, data-centric strategy to identify gut microbiome-derived prolyl peptidases capable of degrading these immunogenic peptides. Integrating metagenomic mining with structure-based in silico screening, we identified two novel enzymes PSP692 and PSP464 from Segatella copri and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, respectively. Recombinant expression and enzymatic characterization confirmed their activity under physiologically relevant conditions: PSP692 efficiently degrades the 33-mer at pH 6, while PSP464 targets the 11-mer at pH 4. Functional assays using CaCo-2 monolayers demonstrated that enzymatic degradation of gliadin epitopes significantly restored expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin), reduced IL-6 secretion, and improved barrier integrity. These findings establish a foundational strategy for the discovery of microbiome-derived glutenases and provide a compelling case for combinatorial enzyme therapy to mitigate gluten immunotoxicity in CeD and related disorders.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Geranium macrorrhizum is known to produce bioactive extracts and essential oils rich in monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenes. While various Geranium species have demonstrated antiprotozoal activity, the potential of G. macrorrhizum against protozoan parasites remains unexplored. Given the increasing resistance of protozoan pathogens to conventional treatments, there is a pressing need to identify alternative therapeutic agents from natural sources. Plant material was grown in greenhouse and aeroponic systems. Extracts were obtained via hydrodistillation and Soxhlet, and analyzed by GC-MS. In vitro assays were performed to evaluate antiparasitic activity and cytotoxicity. Morphological changes induced by germacrone were analyzed using light microscopy. The study evaluated the antiparasitic potential of essential oils, extracts, and compounds from Geranium macrorrhizum, cultivated under controlled conditions, against Giardia duodenalis, Trichomonas gallinae, and Leishmania infantum. Results showed broad-spectrum activity, particularly from non-polar extracts and EOs, suggesting that lipophilic compounds, especially germacrone, are key contributors to the observed effects. Germacrone exhibited strong activity and selective toxicity. Structural analogues of germacrone showed reduced efficacy, highlighting the importance of its specific chemical structure. Morphological analyses revealed parasite-specific responses to germacrone, contrasting with the more destructive effects of metronidazole and amphotericin B. The findings support G. macrorrhizum as a promising source of natural antiprotozoal agents and justify further investigation into its bioactive compounds and mechanisms of action.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

P. P.; KC, R.; Fairfax, K.; Hewitt, A. W.", "abstract": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) is a rare, fatal paediatric neurodegenerative genetic disease that causes progressive psychomotor decline, epilepsy, speech impairment, vision loss, and premature death by late childhood or early adolescence. It is caused by mutations in the TPP1 gene, which encodes the tripeptidyl peptidase 1 enzyme. To date, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human TPP1 is the only approved treatment available and it does not appear to have a curative effect on disease progression or rescuing complex motor functions. This underscores the importance of developing more effective treatment strategies for CLN2 disease. In the quest for an alternative therapy, we here seek to utilise CRISPR based prime editing (PE) to correct one of the most frequent TPP1 mutations of c.622 C>T (p. Arg208Ter). In cultured mammalian HEK293a cells we screened 16 different PE and pegRNA combinations, achieving on-target editing efficiencies up to 27.36 %. To enable efficient in vivo gene editing, we packaged the most promising PE and pegRNA combination using engineered virus-like particles (eVLPs) which resulted in 12.6 % on-target editing. Given the robust on-target editing and reduced risk of bystander editing, PE is deemed suitable for in vivo testing in the pre-clinical models for CLN2 disease. Overall, our findings establish the proof of concept for CRISPR-based prime editing to correct pathogenic human TPP1 nonsense mutation of c.622 C>T (p.

Here, we identified condensin I subunits in the proximity proteomes of Pgm and PgmL4. We show that they belong to a condensin complex that is essential for PDE and localizes to developing somatic nuclei. Depleting the development-specific subunits of this complex blocks DNA elimination, phenocopying a Pgm depletion. Developmental condensin is required for the correct nuclear localization of Pgm and some of the PgmLs. Moreover, Pgm and these PgmLs co-immunoprecipitate with condensin I.

Using a suite of complementary selection scans, we quantified signatures of positive selection across evolutionary timescales and genomic contexts. Despite substantial divergence, approximately 9-13% of adaptively evolving genes were shared between species across methods, revealing widespread convergence at the gene and pathway levels. Convergence was particularly pronounced for insecticide resistance genes, and was also evident in oxidative stress experiment.

The R120G mutation in  Crystallin B chain (CRYAB) disrupts CRYAB's chaperone activity, leading to aggregation of CRYAB and its client proteins (including Desmin).This causes Desmin-related cardiomyopathy (DRM). Prior experimental systems for modeling DRM linked to CRYAB require massive overexpression of mutant CRYAB isoforms, raising questions about translational relevance. Here, we establish the first micro-engineered tissue model of CRYAB-linked DRM that uses genome-edited hiPSC together with isogenic controls, allowing us to study the impact of mutant CRYAB expressed at near endogenous levels. Within micro-engineered heart tissues (HT), CRYAB R120G mutant hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes recapitulated key DRM hallmarks, including Desmin and CRYAB aggregation, contractile dysfunction, and increased vulnerability to PQC pathway inhibition. CRYAB-R120G mutant HT also exhibited dysfunctional calcium-contraction coupling, which exacerbated contractile deficits at higher pacing frequencies. JAK1 inhibition with Itacitinib partially restored contractile function at higher pacing frequencies, suggesting JAK1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy.

A crucial step in the development of computational tools for the objective and quantitative analysis of tissue sections has been color deconvolution. Color deconvolution functions by separating the absorption of colors corresponding to stained molecular or tissue compartments. The most widely used color deconvolution method in digital pathology, linear color deconvolution as described in Ruifrok 2001 et al., decomposes color images according to the absorbance values for individual stains. However, linear color deconvolution assumes that stains are linearly decomposable, and it relies heavily upon identifying optimal color vectors of stains, which is often challenging. Furthermore, linear deconvolution methods cannot deconvolve the image with more than three stains, further limiting their broader applicability. To combat the limitations of previous methods, we developed an intuitive and robust color deconvolution method that effectively and accurately separates more than three stain signals, does not rely on predetermined color vectors, and does not rely on identifying optimal stain vectors. The proposed method, NLTD 2.0, presents a robust and efficient solution to tackle color variations in histopathology images, enhancing the reliability and precision of computational pathology. Additionally, incorporating the method as an ImageJ plugin amplifies accessibility and usability, enabling researchers and pathologists to leverage its capabilities without specialized programming skills.

T.", "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a single-celled Apicomplexan parasite that relies on a highly polarized endomembrane system for its invasion into and survival within host cells. Recent advancements in imaging technologies have revealed that vesicle transport and organization of organelles in the endomembrane pathway requires a highly dynamic actin cytoskeleton. These dynamics in turn rely on the activity of Myosin F (MyoF), a molecular motor unique to Alveolates. The defining characteristic of this molecular motor is a WD40 beta-propeller domain, exclusively found in this class of myosin. To understand the mechanism by which MyoF controls the dynamics and organization of actin, we studied the biophysical properties of the purified motor in vitro. A MyoF construct lacking its WD40 tail domain (MyoF{Delta}tail) is dimeric and can bind and translocate actin in an in vitro motility assay. Single molecule studies show that the dimeric construct is non-processive however small ensembles move inefficiently on single filaments of skeletal actin. In contrast, single molecules of the full-length motor move processively on Toxoplasma actin and jasplakinolide-stabilized skeletal actin bundles. Electron microscopy of negatively stained images of MyoF and quantitative size exclusion chromatography shows that the WD40 domain oligomerizes to form a complex containing multiple dimeric molecules, which provides an explanation for why the full-length motor is processive compared to the dimeric MyoF{Delta}tail construct. Finally, we show that MyoF binds microtubules through its WD40 domain and can slide actin filaments relative to microtubules. We propose a model whereby MyoF oligomers drive actin dynamics by translocating filaments relative to the parasites cytoskeleton. These molecule features provide new insight into how MyoF functions in the cell to regulate actin organization during vesicle transport.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Traditional approaches for studying co-culture interactions, such as transcriptomics and flow cytometry, provide valuable insights but are limited by their static nature and reliance on fixed or dissociated cells. In contrast, label-free time-lapse microscopy preserves temporal and spatial context, enabling observation of live-cell behaviours over time. A major challenge, however, lies in the analysis of the resulting high-dimensional datasets. Using co-cultures of breast cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a model system, we show that the CellPhe toolkit enables label-free identification and phenotypic characterisation of different cell types within complex live-cell imaging datasets. Our analysis shows that exposure to CAFs drives marked phenotypic shifts in breast cancer cells, including elongation, loss of cell-cell adhesion, and redistribution of intracellular components - hallmarks of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To probe the underlying mechanisms, we performed a Luminex immunoassay on CAF-conditioned media and identified secreted analytes strongly associated with EMT induction.

B.; Rich, S. S.", "abstract": "Rationale: A polygenic score (PGS) summarizes the genetic information of a person in a single number for a trait, and its utility in genomic medicine is well-recognized. Although PGS models have been generated for many traits, they are not broadly available for certain traits due to limited sample sizes in studies of infrequent outcomes. Often, prediction of these not well-studied traits (e.g., treatment/drug responses) would be of great clinical utility and have been underutilized due to statistical power limitations. To support more versatile trait prediction, we present a method of developing PGS models that can be used in studies of any size with genome-wide SNP data. Method: We first generate thousands of PGSs for each study participant in a given data set using their genome-wide SNP data and public resources. A PGS-wide scan involves evaluating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of prediction for a binary trait (or the R-squared of association for a quantitative trait) at each PGS. We present two methods for the PGS model development, SECRET-Best, which selects the most predictive PGS from the PGS scan for prediction, and SECRET-WTSUM, which considers a combined score from multiple correlation-pruned PGSs. This algorithm is scalable and implemented in a user-friendly software tool, SECRET (Screen and Evaluate Catalogued Risk scores to Enhance Trait predictions). Results: We applied SECRET to a binary outcome (type 1 diabetes [T1D]) and a dataset of 2,100 samples, each with 12 laboratory test-related continuous traits. For nine traits with existing PGSs available in the PGS catalog, eight of the traits were predicted correctly, with the same trait-related PGS identified as the top predictor. We showed that the existing PGS methods had rather limited power to predict trait values in a validation set when only 1,500 samples were used to develop a PGS model, while the SECRET methods were able to maintain the prediction power for under-powered GWAS studies even when the sample size of the study was in hundreds. Conclusion: The SECRET methods and tool provide a valuable resource for studies with genomic data but of limited sample sizes. This approach enables systematic development and evaluation of PGS models.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we show the presence of a physiological left-right asymmetry in mGlu5 expression in the hippocampus of wild-type mice, with higher levels in the left hemisphere, consistent with previous observations. Importantly, we reveal that this asymmetry is lost in J20 AD model mice due to a selective reduction of mGlu5 in the left hippocampus. Then, using the light-controllable negative allosteric modulator Alloswitch-1, we demonstrate that selective inhibition of mGlu5 in the left, but not right, hippocampus is both necessary and sufficient to restore working and short-term memory in J20 mice. This left-specific modulation also reverses downstream pathological signaling, including aberrant Pyk2 and GSK3-{beta} activation and tau hyperphosphorylation, in both hippocampi.

Here we use quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in wild-derived house mice from temperate and tropical environments to describe the genetic architecture of adaptive skeletal evolution. This study provides a unique view into the evolution of discordant phenotypic changes within the interconnected skeletal system, since tropical and temperate mice have evolved under the opposing forces of Allens and Bergmanns rules (shorter extremities, but larger body size in cold climates). We generated an F3 mapping population of 449 mice and measured a variety of cranial and post-cranial skeletal traits. First, we discovered that temperate and tropical house mice have undergone extensive skeletal divergence in accordance with Allens and Bergmanns rules. Warm-adapted mice have longer limbs, longer pelvic girdles, longer and narrower skulls, but smaller overall body size. Second, we identified 83 QTL across 13 traits and found that the genetic basis of skeletal divergence involved mainly additive, small-effect loci distributed across the genome. While most QTL influenced only one or two traits, we also identified several highly pleiotropic QTL that influenced multiple traits across the skeletal system, often antagonistically to the evolved difference. Such pleiotropic loci may constrain adaptation. Lastly, we found that QTL for overall skeletal variation were enriched for signatures of selection in wild house mouse populations, providing evidence that skeletal variation in this system is indeed driven by adaptive evolution.", "date": "2025-10-03", "journal": ""}
