Inhibition of SF3B1, a core U2 spliceosome component, by Pladienolide B (PladB) in human K562 cells caused widespread intron retention and modest R-loops gains. Minimal overlap existed between these events, suggesting that unspliced introns by themselves do not cause excessive R-loops. R-loop gains were instead driven by extensive readthrough transcription at a subset of stress-response genes, defining a new class of aberrant downstream of genes (DoG) R-loops. Such DoG R-loops were temporally and spatially uncoupled from loci experiencing DNA damage. Unexpectedly, the predominant response to splicing inhibition was a global R-loop loss. This resulted from increased promoter-proximal pausing and defective transcription elongation associated with premature termination. Similar results were observed upon depletion of Aquarius, a U2 spliceosome-associated factor previously thought to suppress R-loops. Thus, U2 spliceosome-targeted splicing inhibition triggered profound alterations in transcriptional dynamics, leading to unexpected disruptions in R-loop landscapes.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

R.; Rifkin, S. A.", "abstract": "Although similar developmental regulatory networks can produce diverse phenotypes, different networks can also produce the same phenotype. In theory, as long as development can produce an acceptable end phenotype, the details of the process could be shielded from selection, leading to the possibility of developmental system drift, where the developmental mechanisms underlying a stable phenotype continue to evolve. Many examples exist of divergent developmental genetics underlying conserved traits. However, studies that elucidate how these differences arose and how other features of development accommodated them are rarer. In Caenorhabditis elegans, six transcription factors that bind motifs with a GATA core sequence (GATA factors) comprise the zygotic part of the endoderm specification network. Here we show that the core of this network - five of the genes - originated within the genus during a brief but explosive radiation of this gene family and that at least three of them evolved from a single ancestral gene with at least two different spatio-temporal expression patterns. Based on analyses of their evolutionary history, gene structure, expression, and sequence, we explain how these GATA factors were integrated into this network. Our results show how gene duplication fueled the developmental system drift of the endoderm network in a phylogenetically brief period in developmentally canalized nematodes.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

However, the intricate interaction between these distinct neural processes and their impact on decision behaviors remains unexplored. Here, we examined the interplay of these decision processes in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) when monkeys performed a flexible decision task. We found that the PPC activity related to monkeys' abstract decisions about visual stimuli was nonlinearly modulated by monkeys' following saccade choices directed outside each neuron's response field. Recurrent neural network modeling indicated that the feedback connections, matching the learned stimuli-response associations during the task, might mediate such feedback modulation. Further analysis on network dynamics revealed that selectivity-specific feedback connectivity intensified the attractor basins of population activity underlying saccade choices, thereby increasing the reliability of flexible decisions. These results highlight an iterative computation between different decision processes, mediated primarily by precise feedback connectivity, contributing to the optimization of flexible decision-making.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

F.; Vaisse, C.; Caspary, T.", "abstract": "Cilia are near ubiquitous cellular appendages critical for cell-to-cell communication and involved in diverse developmental and homeostatic processes. ARL13B is a regulatory GTPase enriched in cilia. We engineered an Arl13b mouse allele, Arl13bV358A, which retains ARL13B biochemical activities but renders ARL13B undetectable in cilia. Surprisingly, these mice are hyperphagic and become obese and insulin resistant. In addition to its GTPase function, ARL13B acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARL3. To test whether ARL13B's GEF activity is required to regulate body weight, we analyzed the body weight of mice expressing an ARL13B variant lacking ARL3 GEF activity (Arl13bR79Q). We found no difference in body weight, indicating ARL13B is unlikely to regulate weight via its ARL3 GEF activity. Ciliary ARL13B could control energy homeostasis through a role in development or in adult mice. We induced wildtype ARL13B expression, which localizes to cilia, in 4-week-old Arl13bV358A/V358A mice and found the obesity phenotype and associated metabolic impairments were rescued, consistent with ARL13B regulating homeostatic signaling within cilia in adult mice. These results show that ciliary ARL13B functions to control body weight. Our ability to genetically control the subcellular localization of ARL13B by removing and introducing it into cilia enables us to define the cilia-specific role of ARL13B and provides key information for understanding how cilia act as a signaling hub critical for energy homeostasis.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

This species rich Neotropical monocot clade includes predominantly epiphytic species displaying vast phenotypic diversity. Recent in-depth phylogenomic work revealed that the subgenus originated within the last 7 MY, with one major expansion from South into Central America within the last 5 MY. However, disagreements between phylogenies and lack of resolution at shallow nodes suggest that hybridization may have occurred throughout the radiation, together with frequent incomplete lineage sorting and rapid gene family evolution. We used whole-genome resequencing data to explore the evolutionary history of representative ingroup species employing both tree-based and network approaches. Our results indicate that lineage co-occurrence does not predict relatedness and confirm significant deviations from a tree-like structure, coupled with pervasive gene tree discordance. Focusing on hybridization, ABBA-BABA and related statistics were used to infer the rates and relative timing of events, while topology weighting uncovered high heterogeneity of the phylogenetic signal along the genome. High rates of hybridization within and among subclades suggest that, contrary to previous hypotheses, the expansion of subgenus Tillandsia into Central America proceeded through several dispersal events, punctuated by episodes of diversification and gene flow. Network analysis revealed reticulation as a plausible propeller during radiation and establishment across different ecological niches. This work contributes a plant example of prevalent hybridization during rapid species diversification, supporting the hypothesis that interspecific gene flow facilitates explosive diversification.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

G.; Wozna, J.; Soteropoulos, D. S.; Kraskov, A.", "abstract": "The hand grasp of an object is normally consistent, determined by the optimal, most efficient strategy learnt from previous experience. Yet in certain settings, despite object properties remaining constant and intention the same, the grasp chosen by an individual can vary with a lack of clear preference for a particular grasp configuration. This is referred to as motor ambiguity. Here, we compare the influence of preceding static versus dynamic visual information on participants' choice between two possible hand configurations when grasping an object at various orientations. We confirm previous findings that presentation of an object in an initial static orientation prior to the grasping in ambiguous orientation causes subjects to select a grasp that would be most congruent with the initial, determinate orientation. However, we unexpectedly found that when object rotation is observed between the initial and target positions, the bias is inversed, i.e. subjects choose the alternate grasp configurations. Furthermore, the inverse bias strength was found to be independent of the motion magnitude, and persists even when greater decision time is allowed. We provide evidence that this bias effect is not a perceptual phenomenon, and suggest it is potentially a behavioural manifestation of inhibitory circuits that delay decisions in conditions of motor ambiguity.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Here, by combining gene functional analyses, pharmacological analyses, and live imaging, we propose that the gap represents the time required for sufficient cAMP accumulation to trigger metamorphosis. Not only the Gs pathway but also the Gi and Gq pathways are involved in the initiation of metamorphosis in the downstream signaling cascade of the neurotransmitter GABA, the known initiator of Ciona metamorphosis.

The lack of efficient and less invasive therapies for developmental diseases highlights the need for animal models that replicate the complex pathological phenotypes, while preserving scalability for drug screening. Zebrafish exhibits high fecundity and rapid development that facilitate efficient and scalable in vivo drug testing. Here, we aimed to assess the potential of zebrafish to study PERK function and its pharmacological modulation, and as model organism of developmental diseases such as the WRS. Using bioinformatic analyses, we showed high similarity between human and zebrafish PERK. We used the pharmacological PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, which was bioactive in zebrafish, to modulate PERK function. Using transgenic zebrafish expressing fluorescent pancreatic markers and a fluorescent glucose probe, we observed that PERK inhibition decreased beta-cell mass and disrupted glucose homeostasis. By combining behavioural and functional assays, we show that PERK-inhibited zebrafish present marked defects in growth and skeletal development, as well as neuromuscular and cardiac deficiencies, which are clinically relevant in WRS patients, while sparing parameters like otolith area and eye/body ratio which are not associated with WRS.

Here we define a pathway by which viral infections are inhibited by specific tryptophan-catabolizing bacteria. Using HIV as a model, we bioinformatically associated and experimentally validated several bacterial species that inhibited viral replication. This activity required the aromatic amino acid aminotransferase (ArAT) to metabolize tryptophan into 3-indolelactic acid, which agonizes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Given that AhR regulates multiple viral infections, we found that commensal bacteria also inhibit cytomegalovirus (CMV) in an ArAT-dependent manner. Finally, we confirmed that ArAT is associated with protection against disease outcomes in three distinct human cohorts at-risk for HIV, CMV, or symptomatic COVID-19.

In this study, we present a ddPCR-based approach to quantify P. viticola oospores in soil samples. We used this method to describe the spatial distribution of P. viticola primary inoculum in a vineyard soil at the onset of the growing season. We found P. viticola oospores in all soil samples (n=318) except one. The distribution of primary inoculum at the field scale was not random but characterized by 25 m-diameter patches of concentrically increasing oospore concentration. The results indicated that oospores accumulated 5 times more in the ridge of soil below the vine stocks than in the inter-row. We conducted a leaf disc bioassay to assess soil infectious potential on a subset of samples collected in the field and evaluated whether the ddPCR-based assessment of inoculum concentration had an epidemiological significance. Soil infectious potential estimated through infected leaf-disc area was positively correlated with our DNA-based quantification of oospores.

Two systems synthesize peptidoglycan during the growth of rod-shaped bacteria, which are found pervasively across diverse bacterial taxa: the multi-protein Rod complexes are critical for cell shape because they synthesize anisotropic peptidoglycan oriented along the cell circumference, whereas PBP1 synthesizes isotropic peptidoglycan (Fig. 1A). In Gram-positive bacteria, rod shape is also dependent on wall teichoic acids5, an abundant cell wall polymer, for entirely unknown reasons. Here, we show that teichoic acids occlude nanoscopic pores in the cell wall, which simultaneously promotes Rod complex activity and inhibits PBP1. Depletion of teichoic acids exposed these pores within minutes, coinciding with a rapid activation of PBP1. In contrast to previous steady-state measurements, we found that teichoic acid depletion also caused the transient arrest of Rod complexes prior to the onset of amorphous growth. Teichoic acids, therefore, are a new critical factor in peptidoglycan synthesis regulation. Our work further identifies the cell wall, via its molecular-scale structure, as a non-canonical auto-regulatory factor in its own synthesis. Since teichoic acids additionally govern peptidoglycan hydrolysis, our results position these polymers as 'master regulators' of rod-shaped cell growth.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Current management strategies rely heavily on pesticides, but some effective pesticides are being withdrawn and the efficiency of remaining pesticides is also decreasing as aphids build up resistance. Biological control using predators can provide a sustainable alternative to pesticides under some circumstances, while the deliberate introduction of facultative bacterial endosymbionts that induce host fitness costs and reduce plant virus transmission provides another potential future strategy to combat aphid pests. However, new control options should not be antagonistic, with the concern that the effectiveness of biocontrol might be altered by endosymbiont presence in hosts. We, therefore, tested if predation by two aphidophagous ladybirds, Adalia bipunctata and Harmonia conformis, on the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, and the oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, was affected by transinfected Rickettsiella viridis and both native and transinfected Regiella insecticola endosymbionts at different temperatures. The predation rate of aphids infected by either endosymbiont was higher at 14 degrees C than the rate for uninfected aphids of both species, but the opposite pattern was apparent at 20 degrees C and for one host-endosymbiont combination at 26 degrees C. Overall, the results showed that higher temperatures increased predation, while differences between intermediate and low temperatures were species dependent. No transmission of endosymbionts from aphid to ladybird through predation was detected. These findings point to a lack of consistent effects of the investigated endosymbionts on predation rates in these major aphid pests.

This Food Pellet Competition Test (FPCT) was designed to (1) provide researchers with a choice of new food competition paradigm and (2) expose psychological factors influencing the establishment and/or expression social status in mice by avoiding direct physical competition between contenders. Meanwhile, we wanted to evaluate the consistency of social ranking results between FPCT and typically available space competition paradigms - tube test and warm spot test (WST). We hypothesized inconsistency of rankings of mice tested by FPCT, tube test and WST as they possess different targets for mice to compete and different factors determining competitiveness.

L.; Banerjee, S.", "abstract": "Neural tube closure is a critical morphogenetic process in vertebrate development, and failure to close cranial regions such as the hindbrain neuropore (HNP) leads to severe congenital malformations. While mechanical forces like actomyosin purse-string contraction and directional cell crawling have been implicated in driving HNP closure, how these forces organize local cell shape and motion to produce large-scale tissue remodeling remains poorly understood. Using live and fixed imaging of mouse embryos combined with cell-based biophysical modeling, we show that these force-generating mechanisms are insufficient to explain the robust patterns of cell elongation and nematic alignment observed at the HNP border. Instead, we show that local anisotropic stress and cytoskeletal organization are required to generate these patterns and promote midline cell motion. Our model captures key features of cell shape dynamics and emergent nematic order, which we confirm experimentally, including the alignment of actin fibers with cell shape and enhanced midline cell speed. Comparative analysis with chick embryos, which lack supracellular purse-strings, supports a conserved link between tension generation and cellular patterning. These findings establish a physical framework connecting force generation, cell shape anisotropy, and tissue morphodynamics during epithelial gap closure.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Surprisingly, over 10 months, concomitant postnatal deletion of Cox-1 and -2 failed to cause intestinal injury in mice unless they were treated with naproxen or its structural analog, phenylpropionic acid, which is not a COX inhibitor. Cox double knockout mice exhibit a distinct gut microbiome composition and cohousing them with controls rescues their dysbiosis and delays the onset of NSAID-induced GI bleeding. Suppression of bile acid synthesis is also protective. In both the UK Biobank and All of US, coadministration of antibiotics with NSAIDs is associated with an increased frequency of GI bleeding.

On solid surfaces leeches display crawling, a rhythmic motor pattern that can be elicited in the isolated nerve cord or even in single ganglia isolated from it. This study aimed to learn how this motor output is shaped by concurrent premotor signals. Specifically, we analyzed how electrophysiological manipulation of a premotor nonspiking (NS) neuron, that forms a recurrent inhibitory circuit (homologous to vertebrate Renshaw cells), shapes the leech crawling motor pattern. The study included a quantitative analysis of motor units active throughout the fictive crawling cycle that shows that the rhythmic motor output in isolated ganglia mirrors the phase relationships observed in vivo.

Quantifying the proteins present in flagellar motors from a range of species delivers insight into how motility has changed throughout history and provides a platform for estimating from its genome whether a species is likely to be motile. We conducted sequence and structural homology searches for 54 flagellar pathway proteins across 11,365 bacterial genomes and developed a classifier with up to 95% accuracy that could predict whether a strain was motile or not. We then mapped the evolution of flagellar motility across the GTDB bacterial tree of life. We confirmed that the last common bacterial ancestor had flagellar motility and that the rate of loss of this motility was four-fold higher than the rate of gain. We showed that the presence of filament protein homologues was highly phylogenetically correlated with motility and that all species classified as motile contained at least one filament homologue. We calculated the rate of gain and loss for each flagellar protein and that the filament protein FliC was highly correlated with motility across the tree of life. We then measured the correlation of each flagellar motor protein with FliC and showed that the filament, rotor, and rod and hook proteins were all highly correlated with FliC, and thus with motility. We calculated the differential rates of gain and loss for each flagellar protein and quantified which genomes encoded for partial sets of flagellar proteins, indicating potential pathways by which motility could be lost. Overall, we show that filament, rod and hook and rotor proteins are conserved when flagellar motility is preserved and that the presence or absence of a FliC homologue is a good, simple predictor of whether or not a species has flagellar motility.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

These circuits traverse a cortical region (LMAN), a specialized region of the basal ganglia essential for vocal learning (Area X), and a region of dorsomedial thalamus (DLM). Area X includes functional analogs of mammalian direct and indirect pathways that may have opposing effects and thereby increase or inhibit thalamic activity respectively. Direct pallidal neurons of Area X send projections to DLM, whereas indirect pallidal neurons form intrinsic connections onto DLM-projecting neurons. Expression of the transcription factor FoxP2 in the basal ganglia is necessary for normal vocal learning and production in both humans and songbirds. We used tract-tracing techniques to label direct pallidal Area X[-&gt;]DLM projection neurons and immunohistochemical techniques to label neurons expressing the transcription factor FoxP2 in adult and juvenile male zebra finches. Our results showed that DLM-projecting neurons in Area X did not express FoxP2 in either adults or juveniles. We also observed a population of large neurons that expressed FoxP2 but were not retrogradely-labeled from DLM. A putative marker of striatal neurons (DARPP-32) did not co-localize with FoxP2 in most of these large neurons, suggesting that they form a class of indirect pallidal neurons.

We demonstrated that multiple antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation increased the concentration of a wide range of nutrients and decreased the concentration of a wide range of microbial metabolites. We found significant but incomplete suppression of VRE growth by individual short chain fatty acids that were decreased in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes.

We also showed that VRE could use most nutrients increased in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes as carbon or nitrogen sources to support their growth.

Here, we tested the independent and interactive effects of social environment and cadmium ingestion - a highly toxic and common heavy metal pollutant - on the microbiome of juvenile European earwigs. We reared 900 juveniles either alone, with siblings or with siblings plus the mother. We exposed them to cadmium-enriched food at 0, 25 or 100mg.L-1, and analysed their microbiome composition and diversity at the end of the family life period. Our results showed that both social environment and cadmium exosure shaped the phylogenetic beta-diversity of the juvenile microbiome, with no evidence of an interaction between these factors. In contrast, alpha-diversity remained unaffected by either factor or their interaction. Notably, several specific bacterial taxa, including putatively pathogenic (Serratia) and mutualistic (Lactobacillus) symbionts, were more abundant in juveniles reared with family members than in those reared in isolation, reflecting classical patterns observed in social species. Overall, our findings suggest that while both social environment and cadmium shape the microbiome of earwig juveniles, family life neither amplifies nor mitigates the effects of chemical exposure.

Conversely, Nodal activates a distinct transcriptional module resembling the early streak. By engineering gastruloids with varying levels of Nodal signalling, we demonstrate that a decreasing temporal gradient of Nodal activity is critical for establishing the anterior body, with higher Nodal levels producing more anterior structures in a concentration-dependent manner.

However, many roles of Mullercells remain largely unknown, particularly for those in the inflamed retina. In this article, we reanalyzed a single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset from Aire-/- mice, which exhibits autoimmune retinal inflammation, specifically focusing on Mullercells and T cells, identifying nine distinct Mullercell subgroups along with five T cell subgroups.

To understand the role of this modification in C. elegans, we functionally characterised the methyltransferases (CMTR-1 and CMTR-2) responsible for installing cOMe. These enzymes have distinct expression patterns, protein interaction partners, and loss of function phenotypes. Loss of CMTR-1 causes dramatic reductions in cOMe, impaired growth and sterility.

High-frequency tRNS (hf-tRNS) is thought to enhance excitability and has been reported to have facilitatory effects on behavior in healthy and clinical populations. Due to the potential application of tRNS, clear demonstrations of the efficacy and replicability of stimulation are critical. Here, we focused on replicating the facilitatory effect of hf-tRNS over the human middle temporal complex (hMT+) on contralateral motion processing, initially demonstrated by Ghin et al. (2018). In this prior study, the improvement in performance was specific to global motion processing in the visual field contralateral to stimulation. The motivation to replicate this effect was reinforced by the well-supported hypothesis that hMT+ is critical for contralateral global motion processing. However, our results indicated that hf-tRNS does not improve motion discrimination. Specifically, we were unable to replicate a contralateral global motion processing facilitation following hf-tRNS to hMT+. In our within-subject controls, we also found no difference between hf-tRNS to hMT+ on contralateral global motion processing in comparison to sham stimulation, or in comparison to hf-tRNS to the forehead. While it remains possible that our lack of replication could be due to minor changes in the protocol from the original Ghin et al., study, for hf-tRNS to become a widely applied method, the modulatory effect of hf-tRNS should be robust to slight adjustments to the procedure.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) [~]22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. Despite being indispensable for sex determination, we detected low levels of amhy expression throughout early development. This indicates the mechanism of sex determination is likely unrelated to overall dosage of amhy and its autosomal paralog, amha. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. The creation of sex reversed lines allow us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics.

Pattern formation involves communication through extracellular signals and complex intracellular gene networks integrating these signals to determine cell responses (e.g., further signaling, cell division, cell differentiation, etc.).

We show that gene networks within each class share the same logic on how they lead to pattern formation and hence, lead to similar patterns. We characterize the main features of each class and discuss how they constitute an exhaustive zoo of pattern-forming gene networks.

In chronically infected hepatocytes with hepatitis B virus (HBV), covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) serves as the master template for viral transcripts and gene products. In the present study, we evaluated the outcomes of anti-HBV multiplex gene editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) using primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and HBV mouse models. Nonviral delivery of SaCas9-encoding mRNA and a pair of HBV-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) substantially reduced viral biomarkers and intrahepatic HBV DNA copies in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that fragmentation of HBV DNA primarily leads to its degradation. Hybridization capture sequencing analyses indicated that small insertions and deletions (indels) and structural variants including excisions and inversions of the viral sequences were accumulated in the residual HBV DNA. These assays also demonstrated that transient expression of the HBV-targeting SaCas9 significantly suppressed random integration of HBV DNA, while this therapeutic approach was unlikely to affect chromosomal translocations involving viral copies.

We characterized the non-content related talk of instructors teaching 48 introductory biology lab courses, half CUREs and half non-CUREs. We identified 14 types of instructor talk that fit these theoretical perspectives: fostering students' closeness with their instructor (i.e., immediacy talk), building students' confidence in their scientific abilities (i.e., self-efficacy talk), and promoting students' sense of worth in their work (i.e., task value talk). Course type had a medium effect on talk type, with CURE instructors utilizing more immediacy, self-efficacy, and task values talk than non-CURE instructors but also showing more variation in these types of talk. Our results suggest that motivation-related instructor talk is more prevalent in CUREs than non-CUREs, but wide variation in CURE instructor talk indicates additional investigation is needed before non-content talk can be considered a mechanism for the motivational influences of CUREs.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we expanded our studies to a larger cohort of RTT samples covering a range of mutations and evaluated expression of the three widely expressed group III mGlu receptors (mGlu4,7 and 8). We found significant decreases in mGlu7, but not mGlu4 or mGlu8, mRNA expression across this larger cohort; additionally, we identified a previously unknown and robust correlation in the expression of mGlu4 and mGlu8 in control individuals. Stratification of RTT patients into individuals with mutations that are clinically correlated with severe versus mild disease revealed statistically significant decreases in mGlu7 expression only in patients with mutations that induce more severe symptoms. We then administered the PAM VU0422288 to mice modeling the mild R306C mutation (Mecp2R306C/+) and found a significant reduction in apneas induced by VU0422888 administration despite no decreases in mGlu7 expression in the brainstem or cortex.

CSA requires a thorough evaluation of each step using appropriate experimental animal models, with pigs being particularly suitable due to their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans. The critical challenge in HT is spinal cold fusion, which current research suggests can be facilitated using fusogens. To refine the technical aspects of the procedure, we conducted head replantation in a pig model using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-chitosan conjugate (Neuro-PEG). In this article, we evaluate the technical aspects of this procedure, the rate of recovery of ventilation after spinal cord fusion, and phrenic sparing in a model of autologous decapitation-reanastomosis in a single swine. Methods: A Hungarian Mangalica pig was submitted to surgical separation of the head while maintaining blood flow to the brain through cannulation of the primary cervical vessels. After cephalic separation, the head was reconnected, and the cervical spinal cord fused. Results: The animal was weaned from ventilation after 5 h and kept on spontaneous breathing. The animal regained full consciousness, demonstrated early signs of sensory recovery, and restored brain functions. Conclusion: Pending further confirmatory studies, a phrenic-sparing cephalic reanastomosis with spinal cord fusion using fusogens has clarified the technical aspects of the procedure.

Our understanding of RS neural activity in older children and adults is limited by our poor understanding of the maturation of RS activity (oscillatory and non-oscillatory) from infancy to preschool ages. The present study used MEG with source imaging and an adapted Dark Room eyes-open task to assess oscillatory and non-oscillatory RS activity. 107 typically developing children 2 to 68 months were enrolled. For the Dark-Room eyes-open task, each child alternated between viewing an Inscapes video without audio for 20s and then resting with their eyes open for 30s in total darkness. This was repeated for 6 cycles. Whole-brain RS activity maps were computed using Minimum Norm Estimates, with RS power spectra divided into estimates of periodic measures (dominant frequency and power) and aperiodic measures (the exponent - slope of the 1/f function; the offset - vertical displacement of the 1/f function). An infant dominant peak was observed more often in the Dark-Room (94% of children) than in the Video-On condition (83% of children). The Dark-Room condition elicited a 36% increase in dominant oscillation activity than the Video-On condition. The maturation of the parietal-occipital periodic dominant frequency increased non-linearly as a function of age. The maturation of aperiodic measures decreased nonlinearly as a function of age, with aperiodic measures as well as their maturation rate differing across the brain. Finally, more mature aperiodic values predicted better adaptive behaviors and daily living skills. Present findings demonstrate that (1) the use of an appropriate Dark-Room eyes-open task provides measures of young child RS periodic activity with excellent SNR, (2) an understanding of the development of infant RS activity is best achieved via obtaining measures in brain source space in order to detect regional differences in aperiodic activity, and (3) a more mature aperiodic value predicts higher developmental behavior scores.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Using a pluripotent stem cell derived forebrain model, we show that FOXG1 positive NPCs express IGF1 receptors but lack endogenous IGF1, instead depending on neighboring epithelial-like domains that secrete IGF1. IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation, clonal expansion, and vertical tissue growth by activating PI3K AKT mTOR and MEK ERK pathways. Ribosome profiling and 5-UTR reporter assays reveal that mTOR signaling selectively enhances translation of neurodevelopmental and biosynthetic transcripts including GSX1, a ventral fate determinant implicated in interneuron specification and autism.

An analysis of previously published live imaging experiments indicates that tubulin is strongly enriched in the synaptic vesicle cluster. To analyze the vesicle-tubulin interaction directly, we isolated vesicles from the mouse brain and imaged them together with fluorescent tubulin in vitro.

However, there is currently no validated method of diagnosing this type of cochlear deafferentation in living humans. Animal models indicate that cochlear synaptopathy is associated with reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave 1 amplitude and envelope following response (EFR) magnitude for a sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tone. However, translating the SAM EFR to humans is complicated because it is difficult to obtain this measurement in humans using the same modulation frequency that showed the strongest relationship with synaptopathy in mice (1000 Hz). Computational modeling suggests that EFR magnitude measured with a rectangular amplitude modulated (RAM) tone may be a more sensitive measure of synaptopathy than the SAM EFR. In addition, because synaptopathy likely co-occurs with outer hair cell dysfunction, a diagnostic assay for synaptopathy needs to be robust even when auditory thresholds are abnormal. This study compared the relative ability of the ABR, SAM EFR, and RAM EFR to predict synapse numbers in mice with a large range of auditory thresholds and degrees of synaptopathy. The results indicate that the RAM EFR modulated at 1000 Hz is the single best predictor of synapse number when there is a broad loss of synapses across frequency, while combining RAM EFR and ABR further improves synapse prediction. In contrast, focal synaptopathy is best predicted by ABR wave 1 amplitude.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Using high-resolution imaging, we characterized the spatial distribution and assembly dynamics of {beta}II-spectrin in human motor neuron (MN) axons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discovered a striking gap-and-patch pattern in the medial axon, where sharply demarcated {beta}II-spectrin gaps alternate with patches containing a well-organized MPS. These gaps lack periodic F-actin and II-spectrin and do not reflect axonal degeneration or spectrin cleavage. The pattern increases with culture time and is acutely induced by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization prevents patch formation, indicating a requirement for actin nucleation in MPS assembly. Our data supports a model in which spectrin incorporation into nascent MPS patches depletes neighboring regions, producing periodic interruptions. This study provides the first detailed nanoscale analysis of MPS organization in human MNs, offering new insights into cytoskeletal remodeling in axons and its potential relevance to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

We find that the embryonic epithelium behaves elastically on short timescales with a modulus {approx} 2 nN/m but flows over longer timescales with a viscosity {approx} 4 N.s/m, and that both properties are under active regulation. Notably, we demonstrate that cell division is an active epithelial fluidizer, with division rates correlating with tissue fluidity.

Hippocampal activity provides a representation of the world around us and our movement and navigation within that world, but it is not known if and to what extent the chosen navigational reference frame can influence hippocampal representations during memory-based tasks, including those focused on future activity. Here, we develop and employ two naturalistic, carefully controlled variants of the everyday memory task to model the use of egocentric and allocentric coordinates in the same arena. By recording hippocampal neural activity through miniature microscopes in rats performing each of the two tasks, we uncover differences in the representation of space, and in the features of memory-based action planning. By also deploying optogenetic inactivation during navigational decision making, we find that hippocampal representations observed during the planning phase are necessary for solving the allocentric, but not the egocentric version of the task. Overall, our findings reveal a functional link between non-local hippocampal representations and allocentric navigation.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Neurons in primary visual cortex are often suppressed by stimuli extending beyond their receptive fields. This surround suppression is proposed to reduce the redundancy of encoding large stimuli and support scene segmentation. We find that surround suppression decreases firing rates in mouse primary visual cortex by accelerating the decay of visually-evoked responses and reducing response duration. The rapid decay of visual responses at large sizes is enhanced by increased contrast, reduced by locomotion, and invariant to stimulus orientation, consistent with the engagement of a network mechanism. While fast-spiking interneurons have faster dynamics relative to neighboring pyramidal cells, the dynamics of somatostatin-expressing interneurons are delayed. At the subthreshold level, the rapid decay of visual responses with increasing size is due to a delayed removal of both synaptic excitation and inhibition below baseline levels following visual input. We propose that the delayed activation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons drives a network-wide suppression and accelerates the decay of the visual response. Thus, these data identify a key role for synaptic network dynamics in regulating both spatial and temporal integration in mouse visual cortex.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

We directly addressed this question by leveraging the Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control (DMCC) project, as it employed a fMRI neuroimaging design optimized to test for individual differences (sample N > 100), with task variants that independently assessed proactive and reactive control relative to baseline conditions. Behavioral analyses replicated prior work with the AX-CPT paradigm, in which a measure of target preparation based on contextual cues (the A-cue Bias index) was both reliably increased under task conditions encouraging proactive control and positively associated with WMC. Analyses of fMRI activity indicated that A-cue Bias was selectively linked to increased cue-related neural activity in left motor cortex (lMOT). Additionally, WMC was associated with increased cue-related activation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), even when statistically controlling for baseline and reactive conditions. The relationship between these two effects was supported by a latent path analysis, which suggested that the rDLPFC-lMOT circuit preferentially mediates the WMC-A-cue Bias relationship present under proactive task conditions. The results suggest this neural circuit may translate strategic task goals into active response preparation as a mechanism of proactive control. Individuals high in WMC may be better able to implement proactive task strategies when instructed via contextual cues. The sensitivity of the rDLPFC-lMOT circuit to individual differences suggest it as a potential target for cognitive enhancement.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

This has led to its widespread use in various computational tools for scRNA-seq analysis. However, the underlying reasons for its ubiquitousness remain unclear. Here, we use a computationally efficient model selection technique to precisely map the relationship between the choice of the best-fit models --- Beta-Poisson (Telegraph), NB and Poisson --- and the kinetic parameters that control the stochasticity of gene expression. We find that the NB distribution is an excellent approximation to simulated data, that accounts for both biological and technical noise, in an intermediate range of an effective parameter --- the sum of the gene activation and inactivation rates normalized by the mRNA degradation rate. The size of this range increases with decreasing mean expression, increasing technical noise, and increasing sample size (number of cells). These findings have important implications: (i) excellent NB fits span diverse parameter regimes and are not exclusive indicators of transcriptional bursting; (ii) for small sample sizes, biological noise generally becomes the primary factor shaping the NB characteristics of the count distribution, even when technical noise is significant; (iii) under the assumption of steady-state conditions, gene-specific parameters (burst size and frequency) estimated in regions where the NB model fits well, typically show large relative errors, even after corrections for technical noise; (iv) gene ranking by burst frequency remains accurate, indicating that burst parameter magnitudes are often only relatively informative.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Subjects viewed natural scenes while their gaze patterns were recorded and analyzed in relation to normative computational saliency maps generated using a deep learning model of visual attention. Results revealed increased fixation on salient image regions and reduced inter-fixation distance under the high-dose condition, suggesting heightened sensitivity to visual salience and more localized gaze behavior. The Shannon entropy of fixations on high-saliency regions indicated a more exploratory and less predictable visual scanning of the images. Complementary EEG recordings showed broadband spectral power reductions and increased Lempel-Ziv complexity, with delta power negatively correlating with salience metrics.

We employed a multimodal approach combining high-density EEG, respiratory and behavioral monitoring, and first-person reports across three conditions: baseline resting state, progressive hypnotic induction (Light and Deep phases), and an ideomotor challenge comparing a hypnotically suggested arm catalepsy to a voluntary simulation. EEG results revealed that light hypnosis was associated with early parieto-occipital alpha suppression and increased theta-band activity. As hypnosis deepened, frontoparietal connectivity increased while parasympathetic activation declined, challenging the view of hypnosis as a passive, low-arousal state and instead pointing to active top-down reorganization of large-scale brain networks. During the ideomotor phase, participants exhibited distinct patterns of behavioral responsiveness, classified as tremblers and non-tremblers, despite reporting comparable disruptions in the sense of agency; phenomenological analyses corroborated these distinctions by uncovering divergent experiential strategies. Tremblers showed increased frontoparietal gamma activity and reduced delta connectivity, suggesting heightened sensorimotor integration and greater executive monitoring under motor conflict. Together, these findings show that hypnosis engages dynamic top-down processes that reconfigure both neural connectivity and subjective experience, supporting predictive coding accounts of agency disruption and highlighting the value of neurophenomenological methods for advancing consciousness science and informing clinical applications.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

The absence of specific antivirals for arbovirus infections underscores the urgent need for novel research to develop effective treatments. Natural products have emerged as promising candidates. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a natural lignan predominantly found in Larrea spp., has shown antiviral activity against several viruses, including Dengue. This study aimed to investigate the antiviral potential of NDGA against West Nile virus (WNV), assessing its mechanism of action and cellular interactions. Using plaque-forming unit reduction and immunofluorescence assays in LLC-MK2 cells, we determine the reduction in viability of WNV viral particles at different times post-infection. The potential involvement of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) and 5-lipoxygenase pathways in WNV infection was evaluated. Additionally, we analyzed the cytoskeleton integrity in treated cells. NDGA, had the greatest inhibitory effect on WNV replication when added 1 and 2 h post-viral internalization (PI), losing activity when added after 3 h PI, thus suggesting it targets early viral infection events. The SREBP pathway seems to be involved in the inhibition of WNV by NDGA, likely due to its lipogenic activity. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of NDGA could be related to its ability to modify the cytoskeleton of LLC-MK2 cells. These findings highlight NDGA potential as a therapeutic candidate against WNV and other flaviviruses. Plant metabolites are among the leading therapeutic resources globally. Further research is necessary to comprehensively assess the therapeutic promise of NDGA.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Deletion or overexpression of ePK2 results in impaired cytokinesis, with the deletion cells being unable to generate single chromosome cells after synchronization and the overexpression cells exhibiting growth retardation and cell enlargement. Interestingly, overexpression of ePK2 leads to a coherent reduction in cellular proteasome activity and degradation of cell division proteins. We identify S200 and T213 of the proteasome  subunit as specific target sites for ePK2 phosphorylation. Functional and structural analyses of site-directed mutants at S200 and T213 suggest that S200 phosphorylation disrupts the assembly of 20S into 26S proteasome whereas T213 phosphorylation interferes the de novo  ring assembly.

Consequently, 3S-iPSCs proliferate faster and spend less time in G1 of the cell cycle. This reduces the opportunity for growth of a primary cilium, an important developmental signaling hub. Inhibiting MCU or slowing proliferation of 3S-iPSCs is sufficient to increase ciliation and improve commitment to NE.

Our theory demonstrates how cryptic relatedness results in correlated test statistics between studies, inflating meta-analysis. We characterize the effects of different between-study relatedness scenarios, particularly population structure and recent family relatedness, on meta-analysis type I error control and power. We simulated data with (1) no family relatedness between subpopulations, (2) family relatedness within subpopulations, (3) family relatedness across subpopulations, and (4) single population with family relatedness. We run joint and meta-analyses on simulations using both binary and quantitative traits. In scenarios with family relatedness, sex-stratified meta-analysis exhibits severe inflation and lower AUC compared to joint and subpopulation meta-analyses. Remarkably, genomic control succeeds in correcting inflation in these cases, but does not alter calibrated power. Analysis of real datasets confirms severe inflation for sex-stratified meta-analysis in family studies, but a negligible effect for population studies with up to 10,000 individuals.

Here, we use a multi-omics approach to identify the oncogenic alterations caused by transient centrosome loss. By integrating genomic and transcriptomic data of the prostate lines, we identified a consensus set of focal copy-number variations (CNVs) induced by centrosome loss in cultured cells that are also detectable within a subset of samples from a prostate cancer patient cohort. Using this CNV signature, we were able to derive a unique transcriptomic signature from prostate cancer patient samples that showed strong predictive value for adverse clinical outcomes. In summary, our experimental system uses centrosome loss to promote a punctuated burst of genomic crisis that is characteristic of genome evolution during prostate cancer progression.

An overlooked question in the ongoing debate is whether this VSTM distraction is linked to the original sensory information or the ultimate perceptual experience. Here we addressed this issue by leveraging the perceptual invariance during ocular tracking of an object (i.e., smooth pursuit), where retinal image motion induced by smooth pursuit is encoded in early visual areas involved in motion processing, including the middle temporal (MT) and the medial superior temporal (MST) areas, but is perceptually suppressed. Our results showed that retinal image motion during the VSTM maintenance (delay period) attracted the memorized motion speed, consistent with previous studies. Importantly, the impact was comparable whether the retinal image motion was due to physical displacement of objects in world coordinates or to apparent motion induced by smooth pursuit without actual motion in world coordinates. In fact, observers' responses in the VSTM task were partially predicted by retinal image motion during the delay period by a cross-condition classifier, where the distraction effect induced by the smooth pursuit-induced apparent motion was replicable using a classifier trained on data from the condition with the world-coordinate motion, and vice versa. These findings provide behavioral evidence that sensory inputs can distract VSTM without conscious perception and also suggest that the VSTM system shares neural substrates with sensory processing, but not with perception.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Neuroinflammation triggers cellular reorganization requiring L-serine for sustained syntheses of membrane lipids and nucleic acids, whereas it causes aberrant glutamatergic neurotransmission involving D-serine. However, significance of serine metabolism in MS pathology remains unexplored. Here we show that serine chiral homeostasis is disrupted in MS and endogenous D-serine prevents motor deficits caused by inflammatory demyelination. We found in a large cohort study that patients with MS exhibit elevated D-serine levels and the D-/total serine ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid at diagnosis. Steric deviation toward D-serine accords with emergence of the intrathecal inflammatory marker oligoclonal bands, and correlates negatively with proinflammatory cytokines. An in vivo animal model of MS, genetically engineered to exhibit distinct metabolic states of D-serine, revealed that endogenous D-serine synthesis mitigates the progression of motor deficits and suppresses proinflammatory and vascular endothelial pathogenic signaling. Moreover, pre-symptomatic oral supplementation with D-serine, but not L-serine, enhances production of extracellular matrices, preserves integrity of the blood brain barrier, attenuates demyelination, and improves motor function. Contrary to the previously recognized neurotoxic nature of D-serine, our findings reveal an unrecognized significance of D-serine metabolism in MS and a protective function of D-serine against neuroinflammation involving disruption of the blood brain barrier, which may present an untapped therapeutic target in MS.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Our findings demonstrate that targeting C42 on PKGI with urolithin A effectively limits diastolic dysfunction and cardiac remodeling in a multi-hit mouse model of HFpEF, while also improving the kinetics of relaxation and contraction in human-engineered heart tissue. Methods: We evaluated various polyphenols, including urolithin A, for their capacity to oxidize and activate PKGI. This assessment involved recombinant protein, isolated rat aortic smooth muscle cells, and myography experiments using isolated mesenteric vessels. Additionally, we investigated the ability of urolithin A to stimulate PKGI-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). A multi-hit mouse model was employed to induce HFpEF in wild-type and C42S PKGI knock-in (KI) mice. Following this, the mice were given vehicle or urolithin A by gavage, and heart function was evaluated using echocardiography. The relevance to human physiology was assessed using human-engineered heart tissue. Results: The polyphenols quercetin, fisetin, and urolithin A were shown to induce C42-dependent activation of PKGI. This mechanism of kinase activation led to vasorelaxation, which was attenuated in mesenteric vessels isolated from KI mice. Additionally, urolithin A treatment promoted PKGI-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban in isolated cardiomyocytes. In a multi-hit model of HFpEF, urolithin A reversed diastolic dysfunction and cardiac remodeling in wild-type mice, but not in KI mice. These findings were shown to be likely relevant to humans, as urolithin A also enhanced the kinetics of relaxation and contraction in human-engineered heart tissue. Conclusions: Targeting C42 in PKGI with urolithin A presents a promising new strategy for the treatment of HFpEF.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

In the fields of chemistry and pharmacy, chemical language models (CLMs) have achieved remarkable success in two-dimensional (2D) molecular modeling tasks by leveraging one-dimensional (1D) representations of molecules, such as SMILES and SELFIES. However, extending these successes to three-dimensional (3D) molecular modeling remains a significant challenge, largely due to the absence of effective 1D representations for capturing 3D molecular structures. To address this gap, we introduce ConfSeq, a novel molecular conformation description language that integrates SMILES with internal coordinates including dihedral angles, bond angles, and pseudo-chirality. This design naturally ensures SE(3) invariance, while preserving the human readability and conciseness characteristic of SMILES. ConfSeq enables the reformulation of a range of 3D molecular modeling tasks, such as molecular conformation prediction, 3D molecular generation, and 3D molecular representation, into sequence modeling problems. Then, by simply employing a standard Transformer architecture, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark sets. Furthermore, compared to widely used diffusion-based approaches in 3D molecular modeling, the ConfSeq-based method offers unique advantages in inference efficiency, generation controllability, and enables scoring of generated molecules.

Cryopreservation offers a promising alternative for extending preservation time, but it remains a challenge to avoid toxicity from the high concentrations of cryoprotective agents (CPAs) required to prevent ice formation. In this study, we expanded a previously reported high-throughput CPA toxicity screening platform by retrofitting an automated liquid handling system with subambient cooling capabilities. This enabled systematic assessment of CPA toxicity at 4 {degrees}C, a temperature commonly used for CPA equilibration in tissue and organ cryopreservation. Overall, we screened 22 individual CPAs and a wide range of binary mixtures at concentrations up to 12 mol/kg, allowing us to identify CPA combinations that reduce toxicity. Our findings revealed that at 4 {degrees}C, CPA toxicity was significantly reduced compared to room temperature. Several CPA combinations resulted in significantly lower toxicity than their constituent CPAs at the same concentration, including 12 CPA mixtures at 6 mol/kg and 8 CPA mixtures at 12 mol/kg. Toxicity neutralization was also observed in 9 cases, especially in combinations involving formamide, acetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and glycerol. For example, exposure to 6 mol/kg formamide alone resulted in 20% viability, but the addition of 6 mol/kg glycerol to create a mixture with a total concentration of 12 mol/kg eliminated this toxicity, resulting in a viability of 97%. These findings support the rationale for using multi-CPA cocktails and underscore the potential of rational mixture design to reduce toxicity.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Animal studies have explored the gateway hypothesis, but data on ethanol consumption are limited. This study aimed to investigate the potential link between adolescent cannabis exposure and ethanol self-administration, as well as the relationship between predisposing behavioural traits and ethanol consumption. Methods: Adolescent rats were exposed to vapourised {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alone or with cannabidiol (CBD) at different ratios, or to a vehicle, from postnatal day (PND) 28 to 44, every other day. Behavioural assessments, including novelty and saccharin preference, goal-tracking, elevated plus maze, and ethanol self-administration (fixed and progressive ratio, punished seeking), were conducted from PND 70. Naltrexone was administered to assess its effects on ethanol intake. Results: Cannabinoid exposure did not significantly affect behavioural traits or ethanol self-administration. However, sex differences emerged, with females showing a more vulnerable pattern of ethanol consumption and seeking. In THC-exposed males, a negative correlation was observed between sucrose preference and compulsive ethanol seeking, which was absent in vehicle-exposed males. In females, THC exposure disrupted the correlation between novelty preference and ethanol intake and was associated with a negative correlation between goal-tracking and compulsive seeking. Naltrexone was most effective in reducing ethanol intake in THC-exposed rats. Conclusions: Adolescent cannabinoid exposure has limited effects on overall alcohol risk but may alter the psychological framework of alcohol-related behaviours and increase naltrexone potency.

Using genetically diverse inbred rat strains, we investigated operant oral oxycodone self-administration, identifying Augmenter phenotypes that dramatically increased consumption during extended (16h vs. 4h) access, a vulnerability not predicted by standard motivation tests. A key innovation was applying lick microstructure analysis (LMA) to operationally distinguish 'consumption' from seeking lick clusters within the inter-reward interval. During extended access, Augmenters of both sexes exhibited a striking surge in the frequency of both consumption and seeking clusters (p<0.0001), driving their escalated intake. Notably, female Augmenters also showed larger seeking cluster sizes (p=0.006), suggesting enhanced reward value specifically linked to seeking behavior. In contrast, interlick interval (a palatability measure) did not differentiate phenotypes. This LMA-based approach reveals that an increased drive to seek out additional oxycodone, rather than altered hedonic impact alone, underlies the augmentation of opioid intake, offering a nuanced rodent model of heightened vulnerability and a powerful tool to dissect reward dynamics.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Traditionally, P. polysora was considered clonal with minimal genetic variation. However, our population genomic and transcriptomic studies conducted in China, the emerging epicentre of the disease, have challenged this view. By adopting variant analyses appropriate to the dikaryotic nature of the pathogen, we discovered an unexpectedly clear population structure with six distinct groups. A cryptic group exhibits high virulence, facilitated by group-specific variation, and diversification of effectors. Although the Chinese population of P. polysora is predominantly asexual, internuclear exchange on some chromosomes have introduced recombination signals. The comprehensive pan-effectorome analyses revealed presence/absence variation and alternative splicing events on effectors, shaping a highly adaptive effector repertoire in P. polysora.

We found that neural decoding reliably discerned whether overt or covert attention was shifted well before saccade initiation. Further, inverted encoding modeling revealed sharper spatially tuned activity in preparatory overt than in covert attention. We then asked whether preparatory overt attention achieved sharper spatially-tuned activity by using \"more-of-the-same\" covert attention, or by recruiting additional spatially selective neural processing. Cross-decoding results demonstrated that preparatory overt attention recruited at least one additional, frontal process. This additional spatially selective process emerged early and likely reflects motor preparation or predictive remapping. To summarize, we found that the neural signatures of overt and covert attention overlap, yet diverge rapidly, in part because overt attention employs an additional spatially selective neural process. Extending beyond a dissociation on the single-cell level, our findings demonstrate that population-level neural activity dissociates preparatory overt from covert attention.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

We now have evidence that resident T cells occupy intraocular tissues.

This suggests resident T cells in the uvea may have similar functions in non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis, a collective term for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases of the uveal tract causing intraocular inflammation. Here, we demonstrate by spectral cytometry and immunofluorescence imaging that non-inflamed uveal tissue contains multiple T cell subtypes including CD8+ CD103+ tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells. Using single cell RNA & T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile aqueous humour cells from donors with acute, active uveitis, we identify clonally expanded T cells which are enriched for TRM -associated genes. We further show that in donors with active uveitis, CD8+ CD103+ T cells persist within tissue in the uveal tract. Using bulk RNA sequencing and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) we show that quiescent iris tissue from donors with a history of uveitis are enriched for genes associated with T cell activation and antigen presentation. Finally, we demonstrate that TRM cells persist in the anterior uvea in mice following resolution of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Our results show that the human eye contains T cells both in health and during active inflammation. Our findings challenge the dogma that the eye is devoid of lymphocytes and supports the concept of resident T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis and as promising targets for therapy.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Reovirus tropism is controlled by properties of {sigma}1. {sigma}1 is present as trimers that are held within turrets at the icosahedral vertices of reovirus virions. However, because {sigma}1 has not been visualized on reovirus virions in high resolution structures and because the full-length structure of purified {sigma}1 protein has not been solved, it is not clear how {sigma}1 is presented on virions. What properties of {sigma}1 are essential for its incorporation on virions is also not known. In this study, we used ColabFold to model the structure of reovirus serotype 1 (T1) and serotype 3 (T3) {sigma}1 proteins. We find that these proteins fold into similar structures with regions of flexibility between the head and body domains of {sigma}1. We also predicted the structures of chimeric {sigma}1 proteins comprised of domain swaps between T1 and T3 {sigma}1 proteins. Our analyses indicate that chimeric proteins with mismatched body and head domain have increased flexibility in this region. Characterization of particles expressing such chimeric {sigma}1 proteins demonstrated that deviation from the flexibility of parental {sigma}1 leads to a reduction in {sigma}1 incorporation on to the virion. Further, we find that even when incorporation is not affected, virus attachment to host cell receptors is influenced by altered {sigma}1 flexibility.

Currently, the Cyathostominae are most prevalent, while the Strongylus species are only rarely detected. Since eggs and, in most cases, infective larvae cannot be differentiated to species level, with the exception of Strongylus spp., species-specific knowledge of the pathology, epidemiology and ecology of these parasitic nematodes is limited. Reference sequence data for several cyathostomin species are limited or missing. Deep amplicon sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) regions of nematodes has been used in equines previously, although barcoding studies demonstrate a better species resolution for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region. The present study introduces a nemabiome method based on the sequencing of COI fragments. This method was applied to compare third stage larvae, representing strongyle communities, derived from regularly treated (RT) and never treated (NT) equine populations from Brazil, France (only RT), Germany, Ukraine, the UK, and the USA. Samples were predominantly from horses, but some were obtained from Przewalskis horses (Ukraine), donkeys (Germany, Ukraine) and kulans (Ukraine). Most sequence reads (87.7%) were identified to the species level, but unclassified reads occurred more frequently in donkeys and kulans than horses. No obvious difference in species diversity and richness was observed between RT and NT equines. However, there were significant differences in species composition between the RT and NT groups. While Strongylus spp. were significantly more abundant in the NT groups, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicostephanus longibursatus, and Cyathostomum catinatum were more abundant in the RT group, suggesting that strongyle communities in domestic equines may have been shaped by anthelmintic treatments in the last decades. The decreased classification success for reads from non-caballine equines suggests that there are more strongyle species specific for this rarely-investigated group and that additional efforts are needed to improve the sequence database, particularly for these hosts.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Here we show differential expression of several lncRNAs in primary mouse target cells infected with a vaccine strain of VEEV (TC-83) but not a pathogenic strain (TrD). Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), suppressing lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (Snhg15) resulted in about a 7-fold increase in VEEV TC-83 replication in primary mouse astrocytes. Knockdown of Snhg15 during VEEV TC-83 infection resulted in the suppression of ten genes including Irf1, Junb, Atf3, Relb, Pim1, Hbegf, Ccl5, Ankrd33b, and H2-K2, all of which were also increased during TC-83 infection when the expression of Snhg15 increased in primary mouse astrocytes. Most of these genes are involved in antiviral responses. KEGG pathway analysis confirmed the suppression of both pattern recognition receptor and inflammatory pathways after in Snhg15 knockdown.

C. T.; Tebbji, F.; Alikashani, A.; Vincent, A.

To explore the genetic circuit by which the highly prevalent human opportunistic yeast Candida albicans controls sulfur utilization, we characterized the transcriptional landscape associated with sulfur starvation in this fungus. We identified many desulfonation enzymes that were differentially modulated and showed that Jlp12, a sulfonate/-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, was critical for the utilization of different sulfur sources found in many niches of the human host. We also uncovered that the Zinc-finger transcription factor Met32 acts as a master regulator, that modulates genes of sulfur utilization including Jlp12. Importantly, we found that C. albicans Met32 exclusively regulates sulfur utilization genes, while in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae lineage, it controls methionine biosynthesis. This work also identified Seo13 as the first major facilitator superfamily transporter in fungi that transports the alternative sulfur source glutathione, under the direct control of Met32. Furthermore, we showed that Met32 modulates C. albicans tolerance to sulfite excess by tuning the basal transcriptional level of the superoxide dismutase Sod1. This underscores the dual role of Met32 in the breakdown of sulfur-containing metabolites and the neutralization of the resulting reactive sulfur species (RSS). Our study delineates a new mechanism by which fungal pathogens utilize sulfur sources and neutralize RSS and underscores its importance in fungal fitness in vivo.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms by which osteocytes, the most numerous cells in bone, meet their energetic demands are still unknown. To address this, we used the IDG-SW3 osteocyte cell line to examine changes in metabolism during differentiation from late osteoblasts to mature osteocytes. There was a significant increase in the expression of glycolysis genes (including Pkm and Ldha), glucose consumption and lactate production during late differentiation of these cells. This was concurrent with the onset of the expression of mature osteocyte markers. Inhibition of glycolysis using the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) inhibited IDG-SW3 cell mineralization and differentiation into osteocytes. To examine the effect of glycolysis inhibition on mature osteocytes, we treated differentiated IDG-SW3 cells and long bone osteocytes with 2-DG. Glycolysis inhibition resulted in decreased expression of the bone formation inhibitor Sost and mineralization inhibitor Fgf23. Concurrently, there was an increase in genes associated with lipolysis (Lpl) fatty acid {beta}-oxidation (Ppar{delta} and Cpt1a). Treatment of differentiated IDG-SW3 cells with the unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid increased Cpt1a expression and downregulated Sost and Fgf23. Application of mechanical stress to IDG-SW3 cells resulted in upregulation of oxidative metabolism, Ppar{delta} and Cpt1a expression. Long and short chain acylcarnitines were increased in the cortical bone of axially loaded tibiae compared to non-loaded controls, indicative of increased {beta}-oxidation. Overall, our data suggests that while glycolysis is essential for osteocyte differentiation, mature osteocytes are metabolically flexible. Furthermore, {beta}-oxidation may play an important role in the osteocyte response to mechanical stress.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Morphology, gene expression, cell death and functional assessments detected no apparent alterations of EHTs and NOs in co-culture under normal conditions.

Here, we combine endogenous tagging of human RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and TFIID with simultaneous live cell, multicolor single molecule imaging to quantitatively map Pol II behavior during transcription initiation and early elongation. Using GRID (Genuine Rate Identification) analysis, we resolved four distinct kinetic populations of chromatin bound Pol II. The dynamics of Pol II populations reveal that initiation is highly inefficient, with over 94% of Pol II molecules dissociating within tens of seconds. Kinetic partitioning of Pol II dwell times enables quantification of proximal pausing, which is globally sensitive to CDK9 inhibition. Single cell analysis uncovers substantial heterogeneity in initiation efficiency and pausing across individual cells. Colocalization of Pol II with TFIID is associated with higher initiation efficiency and reduced promoter proximal pausing compared to global Pol II. Further dissection of Pol II/TFIID assembly pathways reveals that canonical assembly, where TFIID binds first, is linked to inefficient initiation and frequent pausing. In contrast, noncanonical assembly, where Pol II binds first followed by TFIID, supports more efficient initiation with lower pausing. Together, these findings establish that transcription initiation efficiency is shaped by both the kinetic stability of Pol II engagement and the temporal order of preinitiation complex assembly, providing a new framework for understanding dynamic gene regulation in vivo.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The fitness of a pathogen can be characterised at multiple levels corresponding to different stages of its life cycle, including replication within target cells (replicative capacity), immune evasion, and the capacity to infect new hosts (transmissibility). Pathogens evolve towards greater fitness within hosts, which can potentially compromise transmissibility. Typically, epidemiological studies for measuring pathogen fitness compute a single selection coefficient for pathogen variants that encompasses all stages of the pathogen life cycle. To address this problem, we develop a population-genetic model and software for the inference of multi-level selection coefficients which represent relative within-host fitness and transmissibility. Our approach builds on population genetic models previously applied to macro-evolution, whereby speciation and extinction rates are state-dependent. We relate the state-dependence in speciation and extinction rates to competing within- and between-host selection. Evolution of beneficial phenotypes within hosts may occur rapidly (higher 'speciation'), but reduce rates of dispersal between hosts (higher 'extinction'). This new coalescent-based method also accounts for highly nonlinear-population dynamics and variable sampling through time making it suitable for epidemiological studies. We derive the equilibrium proportion of a variant with multi-level selection under mutation-selection balance and show how this can be used in combination with the coalescent to greatly increase accuracy and precision of estimated selection coefficients. We characterise the accuracy of this method using a variety of birth-death and coalescent simulations before analysing a real dataset of HIV-1 genetic sequences from a large population-based sample of 4056 people living with HIV in Zambia. We quantified the multi-level relative fitness underlying HIV-1 'co-receptor switching'. In accordance with previous observations, we estimate that the relative transmissibility of X4-tropic virus is 9%, while within-host switching to X4-tropism is approximately seven-fold higher than switching to R5-tropism, indicating a strong within-host and between-host tradeoff of co-receptor usage.

Here we show that the Pus7 mutation in human patient cells and in a Drosophila model is associated with a specific decrease of tRNA:Aspartate (tRNA-Asp) levels, which leads to slow decoding at Aspartate codons. This in turn activates the integrated stress response and induces a metabolic shift towards increased glycolysis and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Elevating tRNA-Asp expression, inhibiting the integrated stress response or dampening the glycolytic pathway is sufficient to rescue the aggressiveness phenotype, demonstrating the involvement of the tRNA-Asp-ISR-glycolysis axis in this behavior.

The repetitive fraction of the genome of C. purpureus and C. americanus corresponds to 52.23% and 76.82%, respectively.

Four new satellite sequences were identified as subgenome-specific sequences for both species, along with new centromeric variants. The ancestral relationship and the polyploidization-diploidization cycles played a fundamental role in the composition of their repetitive fraction.

M.", "abstract": "Common optimization approaches to solve the muscle redundancy problem in musculoskeletal simulations can predict shoulder contact forces that violate joint stability with lines of action outside the glenohumeral joint border. Approaches with simple joint stability constraints were previously introduced imposing an upper limit on the direction of the contact force to stay within a specified stability perimeter. Such approaches predicted higher rotator cuff muscle activation than without constraints, but the estimated joint contact forces were oriented along the specified perimeter, raising questions about validity. In this study, several glenohumeral stability formulations were investigated, and tested against in vivo measurements of glenohumeral contact forces from the Orthoload dataset on one participant data in three dumbbell tasks: lateral raise, posterior raise, and and anterior raise. The investigated formulations either imposed inequality constraints on the contact force direction to remain within a stability perimeter whose shape was varied, or added a penalty term as a criterion measure to the objective function that made the objective function costly for contact force directions to deviate from the glenoid cavity center. All stability formulations predicted contact force magnitudes that agreed relatively well to the in vivo measured forces except for the strictest formulation that constrained the joint contact force to be directed at the glenoid cavity center. Models that restricted the force direction to lie within a specified shape estimated force vectors that largely lay along the perimeters. Models that instead penalized force directions that deviated from the glenoid cavity center estimated relatively more accurate contact force directions within the glenoid cavity, though still not entirely in agreement with in vivo measurements. Our findings support the proposed penalty formulations as more reasonable and accurate than other investigated existing glenohumeral stability formulations.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Recent neuroscientific advancements have identified further potential in VNS, calling for technical advancements to explore these possibilities. To address this, we developed a neuromodulation platform that can perform both neural activity excitation and inhibition, to further explore spatially and directionally selective stimulation. The platform can be powered wirelessly through ultrasound and includes a charge balancing mechanism to enhance stimulation safety. The platform performs biphasic and monophasic voltage-controlled stimulation, using 6 electrodes for excitation and 2 for inhibition. The pulse width can be varied between 0 and 1500 s, and the pulse repetition rate between 1 Hz and 1 kHz for excitation and 1 kHz to 50 kHz for inhibition. The implemented charge balancing mechanism uses a digital PID controller to reduce the voltage offset at the stimulation site to values as low as 2 mV. The introduced neuromodulation platform provides a versatile experimental tool intended for, but not limited to, VNS in pre-clinical and clinical settings. It is designed using only commercially available components and is easily reproducible, allowing to explore the possibilities of VNS while identifying the necessary components and processes for developing a miniaturized version.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

R.; Shatby, A.", "abstract": "Several recent studies have reported that multiple genes in the M. tuberculosis (Mtb) genome are under positive selection, based on analysis of large collections of Mtb clinical isolates. It is inferred that mutations in these genes are adaptions to selection pressures associated with modern clinical treatment of TB. Many, but not all, of these genes under selection are related to drug resistance. Although the calculations are based on a variety of evolutionary principles, most of these studies have evaluated positive selection at the gene-level. However, positive selection can be evaluated on different scales, including individual codons, and local regions within an open reading frame (clusters of residues). In this paper, we use GenomegaMap to evaluate selection of genes in the Mtb genome at all three levels, and we present evidence that the intermediate level (so-called \"Window model\") provides the most credible list of candidate genes under selection. A further advantage of this approach is that it identifies specific regions within an ORF that harbor the selection signal (clusters of SNPs with a local excess of non-synonymous changes), which can be useful for structural and functional analysis. In an analysis of 2,057 Mtb clinical isolates from Moldova, we observe 53 statistically significant genes under selection, including expected drug-resistance genes, as well as resR and phoR (regulators of antibiotic tolerance, and virulence/stress response, respectively), that have previously been identified to be under selection in Mtb. To evaluate the generality of the results, the analysis was then repeated on a larger, global set of 5,195 clinical isolates from 15 other countries. While many of the same genes were under significant selection in both datasets, the global dataset also revealed positive selection of multiple ESX-1 genes, along with whiB6 and phoR, which have been shown to regulate expression of ESX-1, a type VII secretion system that plays an important role in modulating the host immune response. The selection signals for these ESX-1 genes lend support to the potential selective advantage of genetic variants affecting ESX-1 function, as adaptations to modern treatment of TB.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Using a qPCR-based method allowing accurate quantification of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondria number, we reveal distinct changes in mitochondrial ploidy that correlate with the genotoxic impact of specific agents. Among the mutagens tested, MX, benzidine, cyclophosphamide, hydrogen peroxide, semustine and nickel (II) chloride induced the most pronounced alterations in mitochondrial DNA content and organization.

Traditionally, this is understood through the lens of control mechanisms designed to offset deviations and maintain certain quantities near functionally desired set-points. Here, we propose an alternative perspective to understand homeostasis: the dynamic perspective, in which homeostasis emerges from high-dimensional interactions creating stable attractors in the phase space. These multi-dimensional attractor manifolds can constrain all components collectively, eliminating the need for explicit control of individual variables. The presence of null directions on an attractor allows for degenerate states that can add flexibility while preserving functionality. Using single cell growth and division homeostasis as a test case, we develop and support our perspective by models and meta-analysis of numerous single-cell datasets across organisms and conditions. Importantly, we do not reject the control-theory perspective but rather suggest that control circuit models can be seen as low-dimensional projections of a more complex, multi-dimensional system.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a systematic framework to investigate nutrient dependencies and applied it to study glutamine addiction. By measuring metabolite exchange rates across 54 cancer cell lines with different levels of dependency on extracellular glutamine and in human stem cells, we discovered that a dualistic regulation of glutamate biosynthesis from glutamine or aspartate, driven by the tissue of origin, generates a tradeoff between fast growth and metabolic flexibility. Monitoring dynamic metabolic adaptation to glutamine deprivation showed that the role of glutamine as limiting substrate in purine biosynthesis is not responsible for glutamine dependency. Rather, growth arrest is mediated by glutamine as a signaling molecule. Our approach opens new opportunities to map, mechanistically investigate and pharmacologically interfere with metabolic dependencies, beyond glutamine addiction.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

We systematically evaluate many widely used community detection algorithms and their variants to identify clusters in complex networks. As the ground truth for assessing accuracy, we use artificial networks modeled on power-law distributions and real-world social networks. In addition, we also performed gene enrichment analysis on human and yeast protein protein interaction networks to evaluate algorithms on their ability to uncover enriched communities. We implement and adapt an extensive suite of classical algorithms and their modern variants, classified into five types: stochastic, kernel-based, modularity-based, hierarchical, and local search-based. The algorithms are benchmarked primarily using the Normalized Mutual Information metric, with additional analyses focused on granularity by examining cluster ratio and computational time complexity. We find that decreasing the modularity of networks leads to a consistent decline in performance that follows a sigmoidal trajectory as communities become less defined. Algorithms with greater granularity remain stable when community structures are less distinct, while computation time remains independent of network modularity. Additionally, algorithms tend to perform poorly on smaller networks, and higher accuracy often requires a time complexity trade off for specific high performing methods. However, as the analysis expands to more extensive networks, this trade off becomes more pronounced, highlighting the need for efficient scalability. Based on our benchmark and gene enrichment analysis results, we also present recommendations to practitioners. Our robust Python package, complete with a user friendly command-line interface, empowers users to easily apply these algorithms to their datasets.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

In the latter case, stochastic HIV gene expression tended to be a pure epigenetic phenomenon: the identical provirus demonstrated fluctuations in its transcription with an elevated frequency. We observed similar expression patterns between sense and antisense RNA transcripts. Notably, both HIV long terminal repeats reacted to drug stimulation and may reveal distinct behaviors.

Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), we quantified GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and inferior occipital gyrus (IOG). Parallel gut microbiome profiling identified functional pathways associated with the synthesis and degradation of GABA, glutamate, short-chain fatty acids, p-cresol, and inositol. We observed significant, region-specific associations between microbial neuroactive pathways and both neurotransmitter concentrations and excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, a key regulator of neuroplasticity and mental health. Notably, microbial GABA synthesis pathways were inversely related to brain glutamate levels in the dlPFC, while glutamate synthesis pathways correlated with GABA levels in the ACC. Additional pathways, including p-cresol and SCFA metabolism, showed region-dependent relationships with brain neurochemistry and E/I ratios. These neurochemical findings were complemented by associations between the same microbial pathways and psychological outcomes, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality.

Participants were instructed to ignore a salient distractor that appeared more frequently at one specific location than at others. Learning high-probability distractor locations reduced attentional capture by salient distractors, coinciding with increased micro-saccade rates and decodable representations of these locations in alpha power (8-14 Hz) before stimulus onset. Strikingly, these anticipatory micro-saccades were more frequently directed toward high-probability distractor locations than away from them, supporting a reactive suppression mechanism.

However, little is known about the basis of sex-based differences in human neutrophils. Methods Starting with human neutrophils from healthy donors, we used RNA-seq to examine total RNA profiles, RNAs not associated with ribosomes and thus not being translated, RNAs in monosomes, and RNAs in polysomes and thus heavily translated. Results There were sex-based differences in the levels of RNAs across free RNA, monosome, and polysome fractions. Male neutrophils had increased levels of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins in the free RNA fractions, indicating low levels of translation. The polysomes of male neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, and cell activation. The polysomes of female neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs associated the regulation of metabolic processes, cytokine responses, and mitochondrial proteins. Conclusions These data indicate that male and female neutrophils have different expression patterns and different translation efficiency of some mRNAs.

Here, we combine metabolomics, metagenomes, and viromes to demonstrate that phage abundances have significant relationships with DOM composition on the reefs of Curacao, Southern Caribbean. By constructing co-occurrence networks between free or cell-associated viruses and exometabolites, we identified thousands of statistically significant associations between phages and organic compounds. While total viral abundances did not significantly correlate with overall dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, cell-associated phages had significantly more positive associations with compounds that had a reduced nominal oxidative state of carbon (NOSC). Furthermore, temperate phages were more frequently correlated with metabolites exhibiting higher Gibbs energy than lytic phages. Six of the ten viruses with the highest number of positive associations with metabolites were temperate (i.e., encoded an integrase or were identified as a prophage), despite this network consisting of approximately 90% lytic viruses. These temperate viruses were predicted to infect members of the genus Sphingobium.

Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these tod genes, unusual among Acinetobacter species, were likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that todF and todC1 are co-transcribed, while the adjacent fadL2 gene, encoding a putative outer membrane transporter corresponding to P. putida todX, is independently transcribed. Functional characterization using gene-knockout mutants revealed that TodC1, the large subunit of dioxygenase, is essential for growth on toluene, whereas FadL2 is not essential. Growth experiments further showed that the todC1 knockout mutant could metabolize benzoate, but not toluene or benzene, confirming that the TOD pathway is the primary route for toluene and benzene degradation in Tol 5.

Overexpression of dominant-negative Rab4 or Rab5 similarly inhibits neutrophil migration. Our data suggests that RABEP1 drives endosomal recycling, Rac activation, and leading-edge actin polymerization, providing significant insights into the role of the endocytic pathway in neutrophil motility.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

This enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites, pyridoxal-phosphate inactivation and consequently severe neurological symptoms. Current treatments, including vitamin B6 supplementation and lysine-restricted diets, partially alleviate seizures and intellectual disability but are not curative. To explore underlying mechanisms and potential therapies, we generated patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem lines (hiPSC) that were subsequently differentiated into astrocytes, the primary source of ALDH7A1 in the brain and key regulators of metabolic homeostasis. Metabolomic analyses confirmed elevated PDE biomarkers, and RNA sequencing revealed gene expression changes consistent with increased oxidative stress. Oxidative damage was validated by markers of DNA oxidation and lipid peroxidation. In addition, dysregulated oxygen consumption rates suggested mitochondrial dysfunction in PDE astrocytes. Notably, these pathological phenotypes were alleviated by downregulating AASS, the first enzyme of the lysine catabolism, by using CRISPR/Cas9 editing or antisense oligonucleotides (AON). This demonstrates that lysine catabolism underlies these phenotypes and highlights the therapeutic potential of AON therapy targeting AASS to reduce neurotoxic metabolite accumulation. These findings provide a promising strategy for developing targeted treatments for PDE and other rare neurometabolic disorders.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

One form of LD degradation is autophagy-mediated, referred to as lipophagy. Here, we demonstrate that Pln1, a perilipin located on the surface of LDs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, previously known for its role in LD biogenesis, is essential for lipophagy. Pln1 facilitates the docking of cytosolic LDs to vacuoles, the lysosome-like organelles responsible for LD degradation, under various nutrient conditions. Molecular dissection of Pln1 revealed that the N-terminal PAT (Perilipin (PLN1), Adipophilin (PLN2), and TIP47 (PLN3)) domain and a hydrophobic region are critical for the localization and binding of LDs to vacuoles. Site-specific mutagenesis within the PAT domain identified a semi-hydrophobic LD Interacting Motif (LIM), which is vital for this interaction. Furthermore, an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) near the center of Pln1 is required for efficient LD-vacuole tethering. These findings support a model in which Pln1 bridges LDs and vacuoles by simultaneously interacting with both organelles. Notably, deleting PLN1 did not impair survival during prolonged nitrogen starvation and enhanced viability in autophagy-defective (atg8{triangleup}) cells, suggesting that balancing Pln1-mediated LD biogenesis and lipophagy is crucial for yeast survival under starvation conditions.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we uncover a pivotal, non-canonical role for RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) in driving these chromatin state transitions during Caenorhabditis elegans oogenesis. Using the auxin-inducible degron system to selectively deplete either a Pol I-specific catalytic subunit or a ribosome assembly factor, we disentangle the consequences of impaired nucleolar integrity from reductions in ribosome biogenesis. Strikingly, although disrupting ribosome assembly caused minimal effects on oocyte production, loss of nucleolar structure via Pol I depletion led to severe meiotic chromosome abnormalities, widespread changes in chromatin accessibility, and a dampening of the typical distal-proximal H3K4me3 gradient required for oogenesis, resulting in fewer but significantly larger oocytes. Despite their promoters becoming more accessible, oogenesis genes did not show large changes in steady-state mRNA, consistent with transcriptional repression prior to fertilization. Instead, Pol I depletion prematurely remodeled oogenic chromatin, through a misdirection of H3K4me3 deposition towards promoters normally primed for zygotic genome activation. These findings reveal an epigenetic gating function for nucleolar integrity in oocyte maturation: Pol I preserves three-dimensional chromatin organization and maintains proper spatiotemporal regulation of histone modifications, independent of ribosome production. Given the evolutionary conservation of nucleolar dynamics and histone modifications during gametogenesis, our work suggests that nucleolar stress, whether from environmental factors, aging, or genetic disorders, could broadly compromise fertility by disrupting oogenic chromatin priming.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that the rhizosphere microbiome assembly of these landraces is distinct compared to elite varieties, specifically those that come from ancestral groups (AGs) not used in modern breeding. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to identify changes in microbial communities of rhizosphere soil collected from 81 landraces and two elite varieties. We found high similarity in microbiome recruitment between the elite cultivars and the two AGs genetically closest to the elite. The rhizosphere microbiome of five AGs genetically distant from the elite cultivars showed significant differences in the abundance of taxa involved in nitrogen and carbon turnover, keystone taxa and associations within the microbial network.

Renowned for their beauty, roses are cultivated throughout the world for ornamental purposes and the production of essential oils and perfumes. Despite their cultural and commercial significance, the genomic resources of wild Rosa species have not been studied comprehensively, hampering the understanding of their genetic diversity, evolutionary history, and breeding potential. Here we report on high-quality de novo genomes for Rosa sericea and Rosa rugosa. By integrating these two de novo genomes with existing public genomic resources, we have built a Rosaceae panproteome and a Rosa pangenome (spanning wild, traditional garden, and modern rose lineages) using a De Bruijn graph (DBG)-based approach. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny of 18 Rosa haplotypes based on 4,367 single-copy core homology groups (genes) provided robust evolutionary inference, confirming the basal position of R. sericea, and enabled a gene-based macrosynteny analysis across the pangenome. Our analyses revealed significant genomic diversity among species, extensive variation in core gene content, and lineage-specific transposable element (TE) expansion patterns that contribute to the variation in Rosa genome size and to species-specific adaptations. The pangenome also revealed biased diversification of homology groups potentially linked to phenotypic plasticity in Rosa. Specifically, our analysis of the rose scent-related gene family, NUDX1, uncovered its evolutionary trajectory in Rosa, in which TEs insertions provided putative novel regulatory elements that facilitated adaptive evolution in metabolic pathways. This pangenomic study deepens our understanding of the genetic diversity and evolution of traits within the Rosa genus.

To elucidate the mechanism behind this aptamer-induced full activation of the IR, we determined the structure of the IR in complex with a dimeric form of A62 (A62D) linked by an 8-nucleotide connector. We identified three distinct conformations of the IR: arrowhead-shaped, pseudo-arrowhead-shaped, and pseudo-gamma-shaped. The pseudo-gamma-shaped conformation closely resembles the structure of a fully active IR bound by a single insulin molecule. In these configurations, only one A62 monomer (A62M) within the A62D dimer binds to the IR dimer.

Most antiviral therapies target the -subfamily of HHVs, while treatment options for the {beta}- and {gamma}-subfamilies remain limited. A key antiviral target in -subfamily is the helicase-primase complex (HPC), which is essential for viral DNA replication; however, its structure and inhibition mechanism have remained unclear. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the HPC from human herpesvirus 1 (HHV1) bound to single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) and either of two clinical inhibitors, amenamevir or pritelivir. The HPC comprises flexible helicase and primase modules, and both inhibitors engage a shared allosteric pocket near the ATPase site. Structural, biochemical, and molecular dynamics analyses reveal that these inhibitors lock the helicase in an open, inactive conformation, thereby preventing ATP binding and DNA unwinding. Furthermore, quantitative interaction energy analysis by fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculation elucidates why these inhibitors are -subfamily selective and how subtle chemical differences between amenamevir and pritelivir lead to distinct antiviral spectra. Our findings clarify the inhibition mechanism of clinically relevant HPC inhibitors and provide a structural basis for their subfamily selectivity.

Here we present a novel platform technology that leverages intrinsic post-translational protein glycosylation to enable site-specific metabolic engineering of GFs with azido tags for subsequent ECM hydrogel conjugation. Using Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor as a model, we demonstrated efficient, glycosylation-dependent azido incorporation during its recombinant expression with preserved bioactivity. We further expanded the utility of this strategy to non-glycosylated proteins through engineered N-linked glycosylation via the incorporation of a signal peptide that directs newly synthesized proteins to the secretory pathway where glycosylation takes place along with a sequon for glycan attachment. The resulting GF with site-specific azido incorporation can be effectively immobilized within dibenzocyclooctyne-bearing ECM hydrogel via the copper-free click chemistry, exhibiting sustained GF retention and delivering augmented angiogenic responses.

This study proposes a machine learning (ML) and interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) framework to identify transcriptomic biomarkers for HIV diagnosis using immune cell-specific gene expression data. We utilized the GSE6740 dataset, which includes microarray profiles from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of HIV-positive (treatment-naive) and HIV-negative individuals. Feature selection was performed through differential gene expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. Hub genes identified through these methods were used to train six supervised ML classifiers. The best-performing model was selected based on cross-validated metrics, including accuracy, Kappa, ROC, sensitivity, and specificity, and further interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Seven co-expression modules were identified, with the red and green modules showing strong positive and negative correlations with HIV status, respectively. From the intersection of WGCNA modules, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and PPI networks, ten hub genes were prioritized. Among the trained models, the regularized regression model (GLMNET) demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance (ROC = 0.97, accuracy = 91%). SHAP analysis highlighted GBP1, ISG15, OAS2, OAS1, and DDX60 as the most influential genes contributing to model predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and biological relevance.

To design effective sonoporation-based therapeutic delivery strategies, it is therefore critical to identify the biological responses that determine these distinct cell fates. Here, we developed a custom-built high-resolution multicolour imaging device and applied a single pulse of ultrasound (267 kHz frequency, 20 s duration, and ~110 kPa peak-negative pressure) to trigger targeted microbubble-mediated reversible and irreversible sonoporation events within a confluent monolayer of cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells. We found that intracellular calcium levels rose rapidly and peaked within 10 s in both types of sonoporated cells, although the levels declined differently. In reversibly sonoporated cells, these levels gradually returned to baseline, whereas in irreversibly sonoporated cells, they dropped rapidly, falling well below baseline within 7.9 {+/-} 3.0 min (mean {+/-} s.d.). Using single-vesicle imaging, we further found that vesicles containing the tight junction protein claudin-5 remained mobile with subtly reduced movement in reversibly sonoporated cells, whereas they almost stalled in irreversibly sonoporated cells.

E.; DeVallance, E.", "abstract": "Inhalation of ultrafine particles (UFP) mediates systemic vascular impairment which is, in part, driven by elevated rates of oxidant generation. One significant source of oxidant production in the vascular compartment is the purine catabolizing enzyme, xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR). However, mechanisms linking XOR and/or endothelial glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-sequestered XOR to vessel dysfunction allied to UFP inhalation remain underexplored. Based on known interactions between UFP and the liver, we hypothesized that exposure could lead to hepatic release of XOR to the circulation which subsequently contributes to vascular impairment. Utilizing our murine hepatocyte-specific XOR knockout (XORHep-/-) model (loss of function) in conjunction with reintroducing exogenous XOR (restoration of function) we demonstrate a specific role for liver-derived XOR in the pathogenesis of UFP-induced vascular impairment. Exposure of mice as well as in vitro exposure of hepatocytes to our model UFP, nano titanium dioxide (nTiO2) results in the upregulation and active release of XOR. Drinking water supplemented with the XOR inhibitor febuxostat or nitrite (NaNO2-) partially prevented nTiO2-induced impairment of vascular reactivity. Interestingly, nitrite appears to cause a down-regulation of hepatic XOR. XORHep-/- mice were partially protected against both impairment of endothelial dependent dilation and augmented angiotensin II constriction. To further demonstrate the role of circulating XOR in nTiO2-induced impairment of vessel reactivity, XORHep-/- mice had circulating XOR restored by i.v. injection prior to exposure, which eliminated the protection of the hepatic knockout. It is important to note that acute restoration of intraluminal XOR in isolated vessels did not alter endothelial-dependent dilation or angiotensin II constriction. As such, we interrogated potential downstream mediators of XOR effects on endothelial function and found a decrease in the repressive trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone 3. Together these findings demonstrate that circulating XOR is a key contributor to endothelial dysfunction caused by UFP exposure. However, the impairment is not acute in nature and might involve epigenetic-mediated alterations in gene expression.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "We report here that a multicellular signaling pathway in the mouse retina targeting glutamate homeostasis and nitric oxide production is activated upon optic nerve injury and modulates retinal ganglion cells' (RGCs') ability to mount a robust regenerative response. A novel highly sensitive and specific NO sensor (FL2) revealed that optic nerve injury leads to a rapid, prolonged NO elevation in the inner retina. Amacrine cell-specific genetic deletion of the neuron-specific isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS1, nNOS) or the NOS1 inhibitor N(w)-propyl-L-arginine (L-NPA) suppressed optic nerve regeneration. Steps leading to NOS1 activation are shown to include Kv2.1 phosphorylation and activation, reversal of glutamate uptake by the glutamate transporter GLT-1 (EAAT2), and subsequent NMDA receptor activation. Conditional knockout of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in bipolar cells, intraocular injection of the GLT-1 blockers dihydrokainate (DHK) or WAY213613, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-AP5), or the Kv2.1 blockers RY796 or stromatoxin all suppressed NO generation and strongly diminished RGCs' ability to respond to Pten deletion and other factors. Thus, optic nerve injury activates a sequence of pathophysiological changes in retinal interneurons that gates RGCs' ability to regenerate injured axons.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

We generated mice lacking the Zn-dependent transcription factor Metal-responsive Transcription Factor 1(MTF1{Delta}IEC) in intestinal epithelial cells. MTF1{Delta}IEC mice exhibited altered metal homeostasis and acute susceptibility to Zn supplementation. Transcriptional and cellular analyses revealed increased inflammatory immune responses to microbes in MTF1{Delta}IEC mice. Mechanistically MTF1 deletion resulted in the loss of Tuft cell lineages compromising barrier function against commensal microbes and pathogens. Ex vivo experiments demonstrated that at a cellular level, Zn treatment skewed the cellular composition from proliferating to differentiated cells. Specifically, we show that Zn sensing via MTF1 is required for IL-13 dependent induction of Tuft cells. Our findings underscore critical role of Zn in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis through differentiation of specialized cell lineages, highlighting importance nutrient sensing in the constantly remodeling epithelial barrier.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

However, traditional screening methods often involve significant costs and labor, restricting their accessibility and practical use. In this study, we developed and validated low-cost, high-throughput screening techniques, predominantly employing agar plates and liquid culture assays, to effectively differentiate tolerance levels among various algae strains. The methodologies were optimized using the model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its closely related species Chlamydomonas incerta and the recently discovered extremophilic Chlamydomonas pacifica. We systematically evaluated the algae for tolerance to extremes by establishing precise gradients of pH (acidic to alkaline conditions), salinity (0 to 5 M NaCl), temperature (34 - 42C), and light intensity (40 to 2977 microE/m2s1). Our results demonstrated that these cost-effective, agar plate-based methods effectively distinguished algae strains exhibiting superior tolerance to extreme environmental conditions. These screening techniques not only provided clear differentiation among the closely related strains but also delivered reproducible outcomes suitable for scaling up to larger bioprospecting efforts. Furthermore, the affordability and simplicity of these methods facilitate their implementation in resource-limited laboratories, thereby broadening participation in algae bioprospecting endeavors. This study highlights the potential of low-cost, accessible screening techniques to significantly enhance the discovery and characterization of algal strains with extreme traits. Ultimately, these methods support the development of robust algae-based resources, driving innovation in diverse industrial processes and environmental solutions.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

P. S.; Manganelli, R.", "abstract": "In this study, we investigated how iron limitation alters central metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using metabolomics and stable isotope tracing. Our findings reveal a well-orchestrated metabolic program to enable Krebs cycle activity despite the inefficient action of its iron-dependent enzymes. Under such conditions, carbon flux through the oxidative branch of the Krebs cycle is stalled, resulting in the accumulation of metabolites that are partially secreted. As a result, carbon flux from glycolysis is partially diverted to the reductive branch of the Krebs cycle to support the production of oxaloacetate and malate through the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate carboxylase. Both branches terminate with the synthesis of malate, which is secreted. This unprecedented split of the Krebs cycle and malate secretion in a bacterial pathogen facilitates the continuous flow of carbon through the core of carbon metabolism, overcoming the metabolic stalling triggered by iron starvation.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

C.; Lutchko, M. C.; Stapleford, K. A.", "abstract": "How orthobunyaviruses establish infections and disseminate to cause disease is not well understood. In a previous study using the in vivo evolution of La Crosse virus (LACV), we discovered a cluster of mutations localizing to the LACV Gc head domain. However, we do not understand how the Gc head domain contributes to infection. We generated each of the aforementioned mutations and addressed the role of the Gc head domain in viral replication and infectivity in human neurons and myoblasts. We found that specific head domain residues could attenuate replication and infectivity in both cell lines, indicating an important role for the head domain during infection in vitro. Focusing on the Gc N609D variant which was attenuated in vitro, we infected three-week-old WT C57BL/6J mice via the footpad with WT LACV or the Gc N609D variant and found that the Gc N609D virus was completely attenuated. To address whether the variant was also attenuated in a highly susceptible mouse model, we infected Ifnar1-/- mice with WT LACV and Gc N609D and found that virulence in mice infected with Gc N609D was delayed with several mice surviving the infection. Subsequent studies looking at virus dissemination to the brain show that the Gc N609D virus has decreased neuroinvasive events, supporting a role for the head domain in virus dissemination. Together, these studies define a critical role of the Gc head domain in infectivity, dissemination, and pathogenesis. Studies are underway to further define how the orthobunyavirus Gc head domain contributes to infection and disease.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements such as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) utilize host tRNA as a primer for reverse transcription, and are thus susceptible to silencing by small RNAs derived from the 3'-end of mature tRNAs (3'-tRFs). Rigorous quantification reveals that tRNA level are not directly proportional to 3'-tRFs but specific isoacceptor and isodecoder sequences are highly enriched in a pattern conserved between mouse and human. We found 3'-tRFs are 2'-O methylated by the small RNA methyltransferase HENMT1 protecting them from degradation and promoting ERV silencing. In the absence of HENMT1, 3'-tRFs are subjected to non-templated tailing by the terminal nucleotidyltransferases TUT4 and TENT2 that regulate small RNA turnover. Due to the perfect sequence complementarity of 3'-tRFs to endogenous retroviral sequences, they have thousands of targets in mammalian genomes. We conducted a massively parallel reporter assay using Mus musculus particle type D, a highly active murine ERV, to determine target site rules for 3'-tRFs. Our results suggest that HENMT1 not only stabilizes germline integrity but also serves transposon control by 3'-tRFs in the soma.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

However, their capacity to do so is largely unknown. Yet, some corals naturally persist in habitats with multi-stressor conditions which can provide crucial insight into coral adaptive capacity under future ocean conditions. To assess the role of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation in coral acclimatory responses to novel conditions, we reciprocally transplanted two coral species (Siderastrea siderea, branching Porites) between a multi-stressor, highly variable inland bay and a more stable fringing reef, and measured key phenotypic traits after 0, 4, and 12 months. Reef-origin corals demonstrated high plasticity when transplanted to the bay, as both species maintained high survival and calcification, and matched bay natives' phenotypic traits. Yet, both species had reduced photosynthesis-to-respiration ratios, highlighting the risk of metabolic tradeoffs unless compensated for through increased heterotrophy. Conversely, bay-origin corals had enhanced photosynthetic performance but lower calcification on the reef. Reaction norms provided stronger evidence for environmental specialization in bay-origin than reef-origin corals, which could limit their use as stress-tolerant source corals for reef restoration. Overall, our findings suggest multi-stressor variability may promote specialized genotypes, rather than increased phenotypic plasticity.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

Human studies support increased PD risk following exposure to the pesticide maneb yet animal studies generally report subtle or no dopaminergic phenotypes unless maneb is combined with additional pesticides. Consequently, it is unclear whether exposure to maneb alone promotes dopamine (DA) neurodegeneration and if so, what the underlying mechanisms are. We hypothesized that gene-environment interactions are major determinants of maneb-mediated neurodegeneration and in support of this find that DA neuron viability is quantitatively divergent among 186 maneb-exposed genetically varying fly strains from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). Through genome-wide association analysis we identify several candidate genetic modifiers of maneb-induced DA neurodegeneration and further validate two candidate genes, fz2 and CG14186 which we find potentiate maneb-induced DA neurodegeneration when knocked-down. fz2 and the mammalian ortholog of CG14186 (TMEM237) are both thought to be necessary for intact Wnt pathway signaling in nervous system development and maintenance. Accordingly, we find that adult-specific perturbation of Wnt signaling is sufficient to promote maneb-induced DA neuron loss. Collectively, these results support a role for gene-environment interactions in PD etiology and reveal candidate mediators of maneb-related DA neurodegeneration in vivo.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": ""}

C.; Dumoulin, S. O.", "abstract": "Vision is not instantaneous but evolves over time. However, simultaneously capturing the fine spatial details and the rapid temporal dynamics of visual processing remains a major challenge, resulting in a gap in our understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we introduce a forward modeling technique that bridges high-spatial resolution fMRI with high-temporal resolution MEG, enabling us to non-invasively measure different levels of the visual hierarchy in humans and their involvement in visual processing with millisecond precision. Using fMRI, levels of the visual hierarchy were identified by measuring individuals population receptive fields and determining visual field maps. We predicted how much the activity patterns in each visual field map would contribute to brain responses measured with MEG. By comparing these predicted responses with the measured MEG responses, we assessed how much a given visual field map contributed to the measured MEG response, and, most importantly, when. We combined information from all MEG sensors and revealed a cortical processing hierarchy across visual field maps. We validated the method using cross-validations and demonstrated that the model generalized across MEG sensor types, stimulus shapes, and was robust to the number of visual field maps included in the model. We found that the primary visual cortex captured most of the variance in the MEG sensors and did so earlier in time than extrastriate regions. We also report a processing hierarchy across extra-striate visual field maps and clusters. We effectively combined the advantages of two very different neuroimaging techniques, opening avenues for answering research questions that require recordings with high spatiotemporal detail.

We therefore targeted the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 to primary cilia in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived hypothalamic neurons to biotinylate and identify ciliary proteins. Among the cilia-enriched proteins, we identified synaptic proteins, neurotransmitter receptors, and cell-cell adhesion and axon guidance proteins, extending recent findings that primary cilia interact with neuronal synapses. We also found genes associated with increased body weight and metabolic phenotypes that could represent new therapeutic targets including the lysophosphatidic receptor 1 (LPAR1), which we validated is cilia-localized and we confirmed that its ligand (LPA) mediates ciliary shortening.

We highlight the relationship between normalized gene expression covariance, extrinsic noise, and overdispersion, showing that extrinsic noise explains the baseline overdispersion commonly observed in scRNA-seq data. We validated the technical model by testing the relationship on data from RNA solutions. Interestingly, our model accurately describes mature mRNA counts but not nascent mRNA counts, suggesting the need for an alternative technical model for data derived from nascent transcripts.
