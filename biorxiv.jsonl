Population mean fitness is expected to decline when novel environments exceed the limits to plasticity, but the level of fitness costs is expected to vary among genotypes that can increase adaptive potential. We lack fundamental insights into how and when changes in early development traits increase adaptive potential in novel environments, which limits our ability to predict the response of natural populations to global change. To test whether genetic variation in development time is associated with increased adaptive potential in novel environments, we used a breeding design to generate c.20,000 seeds of two ecologically contrasting Sicilian species of daisies (Senecio, Asteraceae) adapted to high and low elevations on Mount Etna. We planted the seeds across four elevations that included the native range of each species, and a novel elevation. We tracked seedling mortality and measured development time as the number of days it took seedlings to establish. As predicted, genetic variance in survival increased at novel elevations. However, genetic variance in development time showed the opposite trend, decreasing at novel elevations. A strong negative genetic correlation between development time in the native range and survival at novel elevations suggested that genotypes with faster development in native environments survived better in novel environments. These results were consistent across the two ecologically contrasting species, suggesting that genetic variance in early development in native environments could be used to predict population responses to novel environments.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

S.; Sense, F.; van Rijn, H.; Stocco, A.", "abstract": "Despite the importance of memories in everyday life and the progress made in understanding how they are encoded and retrieved, the neural processes by which declarative memories are maintained or forgotten remain elusive. Part of the problem is that it is empirically difficult to measure the rate at which memories fade, even between repeated presentations of the source of the memory. Without such a ground-truth measure, it is hard to identify the corresponding neural correlates. This study addresses this problem by comparing individual patterns of functional connectivity against behavioral differences in forgetting speed derived from computational phenotyping. Specifically, the individual-specific values of the speed of forgetting in long-term memory (LTM) were estimated for 33 participants using a formal model fit to accuracy and response time data from an adaptive paired-associate learning task. Individual speeds of forgetting were then used to examine participant-specific patterns of resting-state fMRI connectivity, using machine learning techniques to identify the most predictive and generalizable features. Our results show that individual speeds of forgetting are associated with resting-state connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) as well as between the DMN and cortical sensory areas. Cross-validation showed that individual speeds of forgetting were predicted with high accuracy (r = .78) from these connectivity patterns alone. These results support the view that DMN activity and the associated sensory regions are actively involved in maintaining memories and preventing their decline, a view that can be seen as evidence for the hypothesis that forgetting is a result of storage degradation, rather than of retrieval failure.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

To acquire iron, many bacteria secrete siderophores, secondary metabolites that chelate ferric iron.

Pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella produce siderophores during gut infection. In response to iron starvation, the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron upregulates an iron piracy system, XusABC, which steals iron-bound siderophores from the invading pathogens. Here, we investigated the molecular details of xenosiderophore uptake across the outer membrane by the XusAB complex. Our crystal and cryogenic electron microscopy structures explain how the XusB lipoprotein recognises iron-bound xenosiderophores and passes them on to the XusA TonB-dependent transporter.

R.; BONADA, M.; Collins, C.", "abstract": "Estimation of water balance components, water stress and crop coefficients at different spatial scale are crucial for understanding regional dynamics in irrigation requirement and crop water use. We estimated these parameters for irrigated vineyards over 3 consecutive seasons (2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21) at 48 locations in the Barossa region, South Australia. We used FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach by integrating relevant data for soil, crop, and climate parameters from the study sites. Numerous statistical error estimates, and efficiency parameters were estimated to compare and verify the predictions by FAO-56 approach. Results show a huge variability in the irrigation, water balance parameters, crop and water stress coefficients, and water productivity parameters. For instance, a coefficient of variation ranging from 20 to 97% was observed in daily and seasonal actual ET (ETc act) across different sites and seasons. Average actual transpiration (Tp act) and evaporation (Es) account for around 65 and 35% of the ETc act, respectively, showing the potential to save water lost to the environment from the soil surface. Estimated actual single crop coefficient (Kc act) across all sites varied from 0.35 to 0.59, 0.16- 0.62 and 0.18- 0.68 during the budburst to flowering (BB-FL), flowering to veraison (FL-V), and veraison to harvest (V-H) stages of crop growth, respectively. Similarly, actual basal crop coefficients (Kcb act) for grapevine reveal immense site-specific variability questioning the adoption of uniform coefficients at subregional and regional levels. Results further demonstrate that water stress (Ks) gradually increased reaching its peak from late November to early December, with variations across the region ranging from 23 to 64%. A comparison of water productivities in relation to ETc act and Tp act exhibit almost 61% higher values for the latter across all the sites and subregions. Dry biomass productivity shows huge potential for renewal energy generation. Variations in the components of ET and crop coefficients are consistent with the characteristic variation in soil, topography, and microclimates. This study suggests that locally estimated Kc act and Kcb act will contribute to the efficient use of limited freshwater resources for sustainable wine grape production.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

D.; Madhavapeddy, A.; Barbier, N.; Vincent, G.; Coomes, D.", "abstract": "To understand how tropical rainforests will adapt to climate change and the extent to which their diversity imparts resilience, precise, taxonomically informed monitoring of individual trees is required. However, the density, diversity and complexity of tropical rainforests present considerable challenges to remote mapping and traditional field-based approaches are limited in scale. This study introduces a new approach for mapping tree species linking a multi-temporal implementation of the convolutional neural network method, detectree2, to segment tree-crowns from aerial photographs and machine learning classification to identify species from hyperspectral data (416 - 2500 nm). We build upon previous work in two ways. Firstly, we aimed to improve the accuracy of crown delineations by surveying the same patch of forest with UAV-RGB ten times over six months and fusing multi-date information on the location and shape of individual trees. Secondly, we extended the scope of species identification to include far more species than has been previously attempted (169 compared to 20 previously). We trained and tested our algorithms on subsets of a database of 3500 ground truth, labelled tree crown polygons representing 239 species in French Guiana that we delineated by hand and field verified. We assessed how well our segmentation approach could locate and delineate individual tree crowns and how well our classification approach predicted the species of those crowns. We extracted information on waveband importance for distinguishing species from our classification model. Based on an existing phylogeny of the species in our dataset, we tested for phylogenetic signal across the hyperspectral bands and probed how species were being classified by comparing the phylogenetic signal to the importance of bands for separating species. The accuracy of delineations increased gradually as additional dates of tree crown maps were stacked and combined. Stacking increased the F1-score from 0.69 (a single date) to 0.78 (all dates). The overall (weighted) F1-score for species classification within the site was 0.75. A total of 65 species were predicted from the hyperspectral data with F1-score > 0.7. The performance for classifying species increased with the number of crowns of that species available in the dataset: 8 training crowns were needed to achieve an expected test F1-score = 0.7 for crown level classification within site. With this new approach, we assessed that 70% of tree crown area at landscape-scale was accurately mapped. The most important wavebands for discriminating species were narrowly clumped on the NIR side of the red edge region (748 - 775 nm). While most wavebands showed some phylogenetic signal, waveband importance for species classification was negatively correlated with phylogenetic signal. Our integrated approach makes a significant contribution to the ongoing development of efficient and accurate methodologies for mapping canopy tree species in tropical forests, providing a framework for mapping trees in diverse tropical forests that is far more comprehensive than its predecessors.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

A.; Riginos, C.; Hereward, J.; Liggins, L.; Jasper, M.; Aguirre, J. D.; McGuigan, K.", "abstract": "The relative contributions of heritable versus non-heritable phenotypic variation determine how selection may shape evolutionary responses. While genome-wide association studies can provide some insight into large-effect loci underpinning phenotypes, they potentially miss much of the evolutionarily important variation in polygenic traits because many small-effect loci will contribute to heritable variation. Genomic animal models can estimate trait heritability from genomic data but are often difficult to apply to wild organisms. Sampling groups of close kin improves their power, yet this can be logistically challenging in species with large populations and high dispersal. Furthermore, many common approaches for power simulations rely on kin structure in the genomic relationship matrix, A, but such simulations on an unstructured A (comprised of unrelated individuals) are likely uninformative. We developed a novel framework to generate simulated expectations from genomic animal models when applied to samples of unrelated wild organisms. A key innovation of this framework is the use of a 'phenotypes-from-genotypes' approach that allows quantitative traits to be simulated from genotypes, independently of A. This provides clear utility where kin structure is absent. We illustrated the use and flexibility of our phenotypes-from-genotypes simulation approach to explore how the performance of genomic animal models can be influenced by different genetic architectures (clumped vs even genomic distribution of QTLs, and different QTL effect sizes), levels of heritability, and experimental design (sampled individuals and genetic markers). We then applied our framework to a study of head shape traits in a wild marine intertidal fish, Bathygobius cocosensis (Bleeker 1854), for which we acquired SNP genotypes with RADseq. Although our working sample of 297 fish contained no close kin, our framework helped validate the power of genomic animal models, allowing us to confidently infer heritable variation in one head shape trait (estimated h2 = 0.17). Our study addresses key methodological gaps for using quantitative genomic approaches on wild organisms, offering a rare example of partitioned heritable and non-heritable contributions to phenotypic variation in a non-model wild marine fish. Our novel phenotypes-from-genotypes approach also provides a new method for simulating QTLs using observed population genetic data.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

In this study, we combine in vivo GRadient-INdex (GRIN) lens mini-endoscopic calcium imaging (to track neuronal activity), optogenetics, clustering analysis, and computational modeling to investigate MePD circuitry. Our findings reveal two anti-correlated GABA sub-populations in the MePD that dictate responses to both UCN3 neuron stimulation and restraint stress. Our computational modeling suggests that mutual inhibition between these GABA groups drives this anti-correlated activity and predicts how these interactions shape downstream responses to stimulation of GABA and UCN3 neurons. We test these predictions using optogenetics and confirm that GABA neurons are critical for the transmission of UCN3 signals to regulate luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency.

Upon lipid peroxide accumulation, p38- and JNK-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2, KAP1/TRIM28, and ZNF354A leads to disassembly of the repressive complex, releasing ZNF354A from specific DNA loci and activating a network of protective genes, including NRF2 targets.

Owing to their unique geographic setting, islands can function as natural laboratories in which to examine the interactions between demographic history and natural selection replicated across isolated populations. We used whole genome sequences of wild-caught deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) from two islands (Saturna and Pender) and one mainland location (Maple Ridge) in the Gulf Islands region of coastal British Columbia to investigate two primary determinants of genome-wide diversity: chromosomal inversions and non-equilibrium demographic history. We found that segregating inversions produce characteristic, large-scale distortions in allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium that make it possible to identify and characterize them from short-read sequence data. Patterns of variation within and between karyotypes indicate that six inversion polymorphisms have been maintained by a shared history of balancing selection in both island and mainland populations. Whereas the estimated timing of contemporary population splits is consistent with the isolation of island populations following the Last Glacial Maximum, ancestral island and mainland lineages are inferred to have diverged much earlier. These aspects of demographic history suggest that shared inversions existed long ago in a common ancestor or spread via limited gene flow between ancestral island and mainland lineages. Our results raise the possibility that inversions segregating among Gulf Islands populations are on similar evolutionary trajectories, providing a contrast to previous findings in mainland P. maniculatus and contributing to the emerging portrait of inversion evolution in this species.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Although originally formulated in the context of operant choice, matching also applies to time allocation in foraging and to Pavlovian responses, indicating its generality across behavioral domains. However, empirical evidence has thus far been largely limited to vertebrates and arthropods. Addressing the broader applicability of this principle requires extending investigations beyond these taxonomic groups, across a wider phylogenetic spectrum. Here, we examined phototactic behavior in the acoel flatworm Praesagittifera naikaiensis, a species that acquires nutrients through photosynthesis by symbiotic algae and exhibits positive phototaxis. Using a custom-built T-maze in which the number of illuminated LEDs varied across arms, we found that the animals distributed themselves in proportion to relative brightness, consistent with matching behavior. Moreover, prior exposure to light for 24 hours attenuated this pattern. This manipulation was intended to induce a state of nutritional sufficiency, and the resulting decline in phototactic responses suggests that internal physiological states can modulate even seemingly reflexive locomotor behaviors.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Here we use zebrafish to dissect DTG toxicity during early vertebrate development. DTG exposure from 2-4 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 24 hpf produced high mortality and abnormal morphology; co-treatment with folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate partially restored normal morphology, whereas calcium had no effect. Strikingly, supplementation with magnesium (Mg) rescued DTG-exposed embryos almost as effectively as folate, implicating magnesium availability in protection. In competitive binding assays, Mg increased binding of folate to purified folate receptor (FOLR1) by 30% in the presence of DTG. Maternal-zygotic zebrafish folr1 mutant embryos contained significantly less endogenous folate than wild-type embryos yet displayed marked hypersensitivity to DTG that could not be mitigated by folate supplementation. Critically, magnesium supplementation partially rescued DTG toxicity in folr1 mutants, indicating a Folr1-independent component and placing the free DTG vs Mg-bound DTG balance upstream of folate transport. These results support a model in which free DTG antagonizes FOLR1, and Mg modifies DTG developmental toxicity by both FOLR1 dependent and independent processes.

Here, we close this gap with Horizyn-1, a deep learning framework for direct reaction-to-enzyme recommendation validated through comprehensive experimental testing. Leveraging a computationally efficient combination of reaction fingerprints and protein language models, we trained Horizyn-1 on 8.9 million reaction-enzyme pairs to achieve state-of-the-art performance, recovering an enzyme with correct activity within the top 100 hits for over 75% of test reactions. We experimentally validate Horizyn-1 across three enzyme discovery scenarios: identifying enzymes for orphan reactions, predicting enzyme promiscuity for both characterized and uncharacterized enzymes, and discovering enzymes for non-natural biochemical reactions including lysine-driven transaminations that enable efficient synthesis of non-canonical amino acids. On underrepresented reaction classes, we find that fine-tuning with fewer than 10 additional reactions can dramatically improve performance. Furthermore, a logarithmic scaling of model performance with training dataset size suggests continued improvement with larger and more diverse reaction datasets.

By using high-throughput toe-printing combined with deep sequencing (toe-seq analysis), we show that BotA2 induces ribosome stalling predominantly when a glycine codon enters the A-site of the ribosome, with stalling efficiency independent of codons located in the P- and E-sites. Our biochemical and biophysical data reveal that BotA2 arrests glycine-containing ternary complexes on the ribosome thereby preventing the full accommodation of incoming Gly-tRNAGly in the peptidyl transferase center. Altogether, our findings uncover a completely novel, previously undescribed mechanism of translation inhibition based on the context-specific immobilization of ternary complexes on elongating ribosomes.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

However, the underlying mechanism by which how Mn induces TBK1 phosphorylation remained unclear. Here, we show that Mn dose-dependently induced TBK1 phosphorylation in the presence of ATM across multiple cell lines, as well as in primary human macrophages and T cells. This phosphorylation was abolished in ATM-deficient cells, and we identified cytoplasmic ATM as a key mediator. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Mn promoted ATM phosphorylation at Ser1893, Ser1981, and Ser2996. TBK1 interacted with phosphorylated ATM at early stages, but upon phosphorylation, TBK1 dissociated from the ATM-TBK1 complex. This dissociation coincided with enhanced antiviral cytokine production. Furthermore, Mn dose-dependently suppressed HIV replication by inducing multiple antiviral host factors and cytokines. Together, these findings identify a cytoplasmic ATM-TBK1 phosphorylation cycle as a critical regulator of antiviral innate immunity and suggest Mn supplementation as a potential therapeutic approach against HIV and other viral infections.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

D.; Nakahara, T.; Kitano, T.; Kosako, H.; Murano, K.; Siomi, H.", "abstract": "During early mammalian embryonic development, repetitive elements such as transposons and duplicated genes are transcriptionally active and play key roles in embryogenesis. MERVL, an endogenous retrovirus, is essential for shaping the early transcriptome, particularly during the transition from totipotency to pluripotency. However, the function of many repetitive elements remains poorly understood. Here, we add a new repetitive player, REFEE, that regulates repetitive RNAs and contributes to totipotency regulation through post-transcriptional mechanisms. REFEE was initially identified as a paralogue of Alyref, a nucleocytoplasmic RNA exporter, transiently expressed during the 2-cell stage of mouse embryogenesis. REFEE preferentially binds and stabilizes MERVL RNA, promoting its export. REFEE knockdown embryos fail to complete zygotic genome activation (ZGA), accompanied by a significant reduction in MERVL RNA levels. REFEE primarily influences transcript levels of ZGA genes, upregulating or downregulating them in a manner correlated with their genomic proximity to MERVL. Proteomic analysis further revealed that REFEE knockdown also decreases protein levels of its RNA targets, indicating an additional layer of post-transcriptional regulation beyond RNA stability. Our findings identify REFEE as an essential post-transcriptional regulator of early embryonic development and highlight the functional interplay between repetitive elements in shaping the zygotic transcriptome.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Drosophila mutant flies that have seizure phenotypes have been used effectively as a model for human epilepsy. In this study, we tested whether stimuli that induce seizures in Drosophila parabss mutants, a mutation in the fly sodium channel gene, affect learning. We used an adult conditioned courtship model and both rewarding and aversive associative learning assays in Drosophila larvae. For the conditioned courtship model, males exposed to mated females show depressed mating when placed with virgin females, suggesting that they learned from their rejection. In the larval paradigm, larvae are trained by pairing an odor (octanol or amyl acetate) with a reward (fructose) or an aversive stimulus (electrical shock) and then tested for learning by looking for movement towards or away from the odor they were trained on in a choice assay. We found that our wildtype CS stock and parabss mutants did not respond to octanol as a neutral odor but as an aversive one. Therefore, octanol was used to train in a positive associate learning task and amyl acetate was used in aversive assays. Our parabss stock performed almost as well as wildtype in learning in all of these assays, although other labs had reported learning deficits in these mutants. In addition, seizure induced through vortex in the adult learning paradigm and cold in the larval assay disrupted learning. These results suggest that learning deficits may be directly due to seizures rather than some other effect of the mutant.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Drug efficacy is often attributed to drug response, commonly measured as the concentration of a drug required to inhibit a biological activity. In contrast, drug sensitivity reflects how strongly a tumor responds to a drug, where a lower effective dose indicates higher sensitivity. Machine learning-based drug response prediction has the potential to accelerate biomarker discovery and facilitate the development of more effective therapeutics. In this study, we present PathPCNet, a novel interpretable deep learning framework that integrates multi-omics data (copy number variation, mutation, and RNA sequencing) fused with biological pathways, drug molecular structure, and Principal Component Analysis for drug response prediction. Our model achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.941 and an R-squared of 0.885, outperforming the existing pathway-based approaches. We employ SHAP-based model interpretation to quantify the contributions of omics and drug features, uncovering key pathways and gene-drug interactions associated with resistance mechanisms. These results demonstrate the utility of integrative deep learning models not only for accurate prediction but also for generating biologically meaningful insights, which can advance drug discovery and precision oncology.

A.", "abstract": "Animals frequently communicate in dense social aggregations characterized by the presence of overlapping signals from multiple individuals. Receivers have to perceptually organize these overlapping signals into distinct auditory objects, each corresponding to the perceptual representation of an individual signal. All the signal components produced by the same individual should be integrated into a unitary auditory object while those produced by distinct individuals should be segregated. The principles of auditory object formation and their importance in vocal communication are less understood in non-human animals relative to humans. Here, using American green treefrogs, Hyla cinerea, we tested the hypothesis that receivers exploit the relative timing and harmonic relatedness of multiple spectral components to integrate or segregate sounds during auditory object formation. Using phonotaxis as a behavioral assay, females were given a choice between an attractive conspecific call consisting of three spectral components and a composite call consisting of the same three conspecific spectral components to which we added three spectral components from the call of a heterospecific sister species (Hyla gratiosa). The addition of heterospecific components to conspecific calls renders them less attractive. Across treatments, we manipulated the relative onset timing and harmonic relatedness of the heterospecific components in relation to the conspecific components. We predicted that asynchronous temporal onsets and inharmonic relationships between the conspecific and heterospecific components would promote their perceptual segregation. Our findings are consistent with this prediction. We discuss these findings in the light of parallel perceptual processes across animal taxa and neuroethological theories of auditory processing.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

We tested whether other primate species possess enriched HCN-channel dependent membrane properties.

However, understanding of dopamine function is complicated by the fact that reward cues not only motivate reward pursuit, but also enable the reward predictions that shape how reward is pursued. Thus, here we used dopamine sensor fiber photometry, cell-type and pathway-specific optogenetic inhibition, Pavlovian cue-reward conditioning, and test of cue-induced reward-pursuit strategy in male and female rats, to ask how cue-evoked phasic dopamine release supports reward pursuit. Cues that predicted imminent reward with high probability triggered a large NAc dopamine response and checking for the expected reward in the delivery location, rather than exploratory reward seeking. Cues that predicted reward with low probability elicited less dopamine and biased towards motivation to seek, rather than check for reward. Cue-evoked dopamine inversely related to and predicted reward seeking. Correspondingly, yet surprisingly, inhibition of cue-evoked NAc dopamine increased reward-seeking motivation and decreased reward checking. Thus, cue-evoked NAc dopamine is positively modulated by high imminent reward prediction to constrain exploratory reward-seeking motivation in favor of a more focal reward-checking strategy. These data advance understanding of dopamine function by indicating dopamine does not simply promote reward-seeking motivation, but rather supports reward predictions to shape adaptive reward pursuit strategy.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Nanomolar concentrations of WS-23 triggered calcium influx in hESCs, as visualized using Fluo-8. Live cell imaging showed that 26 to 2600 nM of WS-23 inhibited hESC colony growth in a concentration dependent manner. Growth inhibition was caused by an increase in cell death and a reduction in cell division. Exposure to nM WS-23 inhibited mitochondrial reductases in the MTT assay, altered colony morphology, and induced formation of gaps between cells. The above processes were blocked by a TRPM8 channel antagonist. WS-23 at concentrations as low as 26 nM caused loss of OCT4 (a pluripotency marker) in hESCs and expression of SOX17 (an endoderm marker).

M.; Fichtner, A.; Huang, Y.; Roscher, C.; Schmid, B.; Eisenhauer, N.; Mueller, J.", "abstract": "When biodiversity-stability relationships are assessed from temporal patterns of species (or species assemblages) biomass or other key variables, ecological stability is commonly quantified as the inverse of the coefficient of variation (CV) or its square. However, just as biodiversity cannot be fully characterized by a single value, the complexity of temporal stability/invariability cannot be completely captured by one metric, especially since CV is disproportionally sensitive to large data values. Ecologists now recognize that species diversity can be fully characterized by a continuum of Hill-number-based measures parametrized by a diversity order q >= 0, which determines the sensitivity of the measure to species abundance. Building on the intuitive concept that temporal stability can be quantified by the closeness between the data vector and the ideally maximally stable vector, we propose a continuum of information-based measures of temporal stability/invariability parameterized by an order q>0. This continuous parameter q determines the sensitivity of the measure to the magnitude of biomass or other ecosystem functions. By varying q, researchers can differentially weight small, medium, or large values in a time series, thereby disentangling their respective contributions to stability. Our framework unifies and generalizes classical measures: the case q=1 links to Shannon entropy, reflecting MacArthur 1955 stability concept; q=2 connects to the conventional CV-based measure. Unlike these traditional metrics, our approach explicitly accounts for the number of data values (i.e., time points), adjusting for time-series-length effects to enable fair and meaningful comparisons across datasets of varying lengths. We extend the framework to hierarchical structures by developing additive and multiplicative decompositions of stability in a metacommunity (or metapopulation) into alpha and beta components. The beta component can be further used to obtain measures that quantify (a)synchrony among communities (or populations). For q=2, the resulting (a)synchrony measure provides a mathematically rigorous, CV-based metric. The proposed measures are illustrated using 22-year biomass time series data from the Jena Experiment in Germany. We developed the R package iSTAY (information-based stability measures) and online tools for computation and visualization. Our measures are adaptable to other functions beyond biomass and are applicable in both temporal and spatial contexts.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

L.; Ghanbarian, E.; Bain, R.; Saxena, R.; Chandrasekaran, M.; McNaughton, B. L.", "abstract": "Early life stress (ELS) and enrichment often have opposing effects on long-term cognitive abilities. Deprivation, such as institutionalized care during early childhood neurodevelopmental periods, results in lifelong working memory and recall deficits. In contrast, enrichment facilitates new learning and slows cognitive decline due to aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Similarly, in rodent models, enrichment facilitates learning whereas ELS induces prominent spatial memory deficits. Environmental enrichment (EE) and ELS can cause opposing changes in hippocampal structure (e.g. shifts in synaptic density) that largely depend on experimental conditions. However, it remains untested whether EE can rescue the behavioral disruptions caused by ELS and how this would impact the hippocampus at advanced ages. To address this, we conducted a longitudinal study on ELS mice, extensively training them on a cognitive enrichment track (ET) or an exercise alone control track (CT). After this, the mice underwent repeated memory testing followed by brain extraction for anatomical analysis of their hippocampus. We found that ET reversed spatial memory deficits at 6, 13 and 20 months and reduced the number of dentate gyrus (DG) to CA3 synapses. Surprisingly, this reduction occurred at excitatory MF synapses surrounding CA3 somas in the stratum pyramidale, a layer not typically associated with MF terminals. Collectively, these findings suggest that cognitive enrichment during early adulthood may reverse ELS-induced spatial memory deficits by adjusting synaptic connectivity between the DG and CA3.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Because snRNA-seq captures nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, transcripts, direct use as a reference could reduce deconvolution accuracy. Here, we systematically benchmark strategies to integrate both modalities, focusing on transformations and gene-filtering approaches that harmonize snRNA-seq with scRNA-seq references. Across four diverse tissues, we evaluated principal component-based shifts, conditional and non-conditional variational autoencoders (scVI), and the removal of cross-modality differentially expressed genes (DEGs). While all methods improved performance relative to untransformed snRNA-seq, filtering consistent cross-modality DEGs delivered the greatest gains, often matching or surpassing scRNA-only references. Conditional scVI performed comparably and was especially effective when matched scRNA-snRNA cell types were unavailable. In real adipose bulk samples without ground truth, DEG pruning and conditional scVI provided the most robust cell-fraction estimates across donors and transformations. Together, these results demonstrate that scRNA-seq should be prioritized as the reference when available, with snRNA-seq appended only after filtering cross-modality DEGs. For less-characterized systems where DEG information is limited, conditional scVI offers a practical alternative.

It is thought that proprioceptive Ia afferents target motor neurons of the same spinal segment; yet, how this specificity, if any, is established during early development is unknown. Using ex vivo spinal cord electrophysiology preparations from neonatal mice of both sexes, we identified a developmental period during which proprioceptive la afferents evoke both segmental and intersegmental responses at monosynaptic latencies. We provide anatomical evidence that motor neurons in the lumbar segment 4 (L4) receive direct input from proprioceptive Ia afferents in L5 during early postnatal development. Intersegmental responses (L4/L5) were prominent at postnatal days (P) 4-7 but were virtually absent by P11-13. To test the role of proprioceptor activity on segmental specification, we analyzed Nav1.6 conditional knockout mice (Nav1.6cko), in which proprioceptor signaling is impaired, and found that intersegmental responses persist up to P11-13 but were absent in age-matched floxed controls. We predict this is due to impaired activation of complement signaling pathways, as Nav1.6cko mice showed reduced C1qA expression in the ventral spinal cord at P9. Consistent with this, C1qA knockout mice also retain intersegmental responses at P11-13. Collectively, these findings identify an important postnatal window during which segmental specificity of proprioceptive circuits emerges and suggest that proprioceptor activity induces C1qA-mediated elimination of excessive intersegmental connectivity.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

The system permits dynamic tracking of cell fate within individual droplets and supports the quantification of stochastic and concentration-dependent responses to chemical stimuli. Using tobacco protoplasts, we further investigated the effect of low concentrations of cytokinins (BAP) and auxins (NAA) for the early protoplast culture, up to the first division. Low concentrations significantly enhanced cell survival and cell growth, while higher doses did not yield additional benefits. This work underscores the potential of droplet-based microfluidics as a high-resolution, low-volume platform for protoplast-based assays and dose-response screening, with applications across diverse plant biotechnology studies.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

This study applied an integrated machine learning (IML) framework to discover cellular senescence (CS) related gene biomarkers and candidate therapeutic targets in GBM. Using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) training and validation cohorts, 113 machine learning models across 11 algorithms were integrated to pinpoint CS associated gene signatures. Differential expression analysis combined with overlap of a CellAge senescence gene set yielded 129 CS related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment of these DEGs highlighted pathways related to cellular senescence and cell cycle regulation (Gene Ontology and KEGG). A multivariate classifier constructed via stepwise generalized linear modeling (GLM) and LASSO achieved high diagnostic performance (area under the ROC curve 0.92 in training, each independent validation set is over 0.85). Seven top ranked genes from this model were validated, with TGFBI emerging as the most robust biomarker (AUC > 0.85) and its elevated expression was associated with significantly shorter overall survival. Spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing localized TGFBI expression to tumor cell clusters harboring high copy number variation (CNV) burdens. Immune microenvironment profiling linked TGFBI expression with increased macrophage infiltration. Finally, single-cell gene set enrichment (scGSEA) and AUCell analyses indicated enrichment of ECM receptor interaction signaling in TGF{beta}I-expressing cells. In summary, IML combined with spatial and single-cell transcriptomics identified TGFBI as a potent CS related biomarker and a promising therapeutic target in GBM.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

KTKEGV repeats (KR) of Syn are key mediators of prion-like propagation and neurodegeneration. Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments, no current therapy effectively delays disease progression. Here we report a 77-nucleotide (nt) RNA aptamer (1R6) with potent affinity and selectivity for Syn1-95 (KD = 18 nM) through in vitro selection. 1R6 significantly inhibited Syn oligomerization and {beta}-sheet-rich fibril assembly and promoted disaggregation of preformed fibrils. Additionally, 1R6 suppressed Syn seeding, as determined by FRET-based cellular biosensor cell assay. Cellular studies revealed that 1R6 cotransfection completely prevented Syn-induced cytotoxicity. To assess the protective effects of 1R6 in vivo, we used a Drosophila melanogaster model expressing human Syn in neurons. Flies fed with 1R6 showed improved locomotor defects, reduced photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased Syn levels in the head. Structural characterization through 1H-15N heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation nuclear magnetic resonance experiments demonstrated that 1R6 targets KR motifs, a finding further supported by in silico simulations. Our findings indicate that RNA aptamers, such as 1R6, may represent promising therapeutic candidates for synucleinopathies, thus opening new avenues in the treatment of these diseases.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

We examined divisive normalization in mouse visual cortex using population calcium imaging of excitatory and parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory neurons, combined with computational models of varying complexity. We found that suppression in PV neurons was transiently reduced, driven by the dynamics of subcortical input, and that heterogeneity in suppression strength was linked to population correlations, variability in excitatory-inhibitory balance, and suppression of both subcortical and local cortical inputs.

The vastness of opsin sequence space makes systematic exploration difficult. New method: In recognition of the need for datasets linking opsin genetic sequence to function, we pursued a novel method for screening channelrhodopsins to obtain these datasets. In this method, we integrate advances in robotic intracellular electrophysiology (Patch) to measure optogenetic properties (Excite), harvest individual cells of interest (Pick) and subsequently sequence them (Sequence), thus tying sequence to function. Results: We used this method to sequence more than 50 cells with associated functional characterization. We further demonstrate the utility of this method with experiments on heterogeneous populations of known opsins and single point mutations of a known opsin. Of these point mutations, we found C160W ablates the response of ChrimsonR to light. Conclusion and comparison to existing methods: Compared to traditional manual patch clamp screening, which is labor-intensive and low throughput, this approach enables more efficient, standardized, and scalable characterization of large opsin libraries.

The complex nature of Tfh cell populations, inconsistent findings across experimental systems and potential differences across species have fueled ongoing debate regarding core regulatory pathways that govern Tfh differentiation. Many studies have experimentally investigated individual proteins and circuits involved in Tfh differentiation in limited contexts, each providing only a partial understanding of the process. To address this, we adopted a novel multi-scale network systems approach that incorporates both regulatory and protein protein interactions. Our approach integrates diverse data types, captures regulation across multiple levels of immune system organization, and recapitulates known drivers. Further, we discover a core Tfh gene set that is conserved across tissue types and disease contexts, and is consistent across data modalities - bulk, single-cell and spatial. While components of this set have been individually reported, a novel aspect of our work lies in the discovery, characterization, and connectivity of this core signature using a single unbiased approach. Using this method, we also uncover a novel function of IL-12, a molecule with reported conflicting functions, in the regulation of Tfh differentiation. Notably, we find that, in both humans and mice, IL-12 is permissive for the differentiation of Tfh precursors, but blocks subsequent differentiation into GC Tfh cells. Overall, this work elucidates novel networks with unexplored roles in governing Tfh cell differentiation across species and tissues, paving the way for novel -therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Yet, for most insect taxa, the relative roles of stochastic events versus deterministic forces in shaping these communities remain unknown. We investigated microbiome assembly in fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR from 12 species and species groups collected across the Northeastern United States. We hypothesized that firefly microbiomes are predominantly structured by stochastic ecological processes, such as random microbial exposures. Consistent with this, we observed elevated normalized stochasticity ratio (NST) values for most bacteria, coupled with high intraspecific variability in bacterial abundance and composition. However, microbiomes were more similar among closely related firefly hosts, and several bacterial taxa, including endosymbionts and unusually prevalent mollicute strains, showed lower NST values, species-specific associations, and patterns linked to geography, season, and sex. These results reveal that deterministic processes--likely involving host-driven microbial filtering, microbe-microbe interactions, and reliable transmission modes--act alongside stochastic forces to shape firefly-microbe associations. By disentangling these ecological drivers in a diverse, understudied beetle lineage, our study advances understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes structuring microbiomes in the wild.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

COs are non-uniformly distributed along chromosomes and almost universally suppressed in centromere-proximal regions, notably creating a significant bottleneck for plant breeding. The mechanism of this CO suppression is elusive, but chromatin state is a contributing factor. Here, we identify three factors that actively limit proximal CO in Arabidopsis, the cohesion establishment factor CTF18, the centromeric cohesin protector SGO2, and the deSUMOylase SPF2. The mutation of these factors allows both the formation of CO in centromere-proximal region where they were completely absent in the wild-type, and enhance their frequency where they were rare. COs can be further increased by combining these mutations together or with mutation in the DNA methylase CMT3, suggesting that multiple mechanism prevent proximal CO in parallel. The identification of the very conserved CTF18, SGO2 and SPF2 as suppressors of centromere-proximal CO highlights the importance of cohesin turnover in this process and opens up new possibilities for plant breeding.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

A subset of RH2 domain-containing proteins from the RILP-homology family, including RILP, RILPL1, RILPL2, JIP3, and JIP4 are Rab effectors that recognize the LRRK2-phosphorylated switch 2 threonine of phospho-Rab8A and phospho-Rab10. More recently, phospho-Rabs have been found on lysosomal membranes within multi-protein assemblies involving TMEM55B and RILPL1. TMEM55B is a 284-residue lysosomal membrane protein with no homology to known proteins. It comprises a 218-residue cytosolic N-terminal region and two predicted transmembrane -helices. Residues 80-160, which face the cytosol, mediate binding to a C-terminal motif of RILPL1, formed after RILPL1 associates with phospho-Rab8A. Here, we report the crystal structures of TMEM55B alone and in complex with a C-terminal RILPL1 peptide, encompassing the TMEM55B interaction region, which we define as the TMEM55B Binding Motif (TBM). The cytosolic domain of TMEM55B adopts a rigid architecture of two tandem RING-like domains, each forming a Zn-stabilized 40-residue {beta}-sandwich. TBM binding is mediated primarily by backbone hydrogen bonding and anchored by two glutamate residues from RILPL1. These findings support a model in which RILPL1 is recruited to phospho-Rab8A-positive lysosomes prior to TMEM55B engagement. Further co-immunoprecipitation and mutational analyses indicate that TMEM55B forms complexes independently of phospho-Rabs with proteins containing a conserved TBM, like that of RILPL1, including JIP3, JIP4, OCRL, WDR81, and TBC1D9B.

Threatened species persist in phosphorus-limited nutrient-poor habitats, while naturalized and invasive species more often occur in nitrogen-limited nutrient-rich habitats. These opposing niches suggest invasive species do not directly displace threatened species; instead, species replacement and extinction result from nutrient regime shifts. Mitigating and preventing nutrient enrichment, especially phosphorus, for nature conservation protects existing nutrient niches for threatened species and limits plant invasion.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Natural chemical chronologies stored in metabolically inert, incrementally growing tissues (e.g., otoliths) provide a powerful tool for this purpose. However, traditional approaches face biological challenges (e.g., dispersal, maternal effects), collapse chronological data into summary metrics, and rely on subjective interpretation--limiting their accuracy and scalability. We present a novel, flexible framework that integrates machine learning, time-series analysis, and ensemble modeling to improve provenance assignment from archival tissue chemistry. Using otolith 87Sr/86Sr profiles from 17 natal sources of California Central Valley Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), we moved beyond conventional summary-based methods by developing fully automated time-series feature extraction, explicit time-series classification (including dynamic time warping [DTW] with k-nearest neighbors [KNN]), and ensemble models that combine multiple classifiers. We further incorporated simulated data to represent under-sampled life history strategies and validated the framework on real-world, known- and unknown-origin samples. Time-series-based approaches consistently outperformed traditional methods, particularly for sources with strong maternal signatures or early dispersal. Feature extraction approaches informed by biological knowledge were most effective when chemical chronologies followed predictable life-stage-specific patterns, whereas explicit time-series classification (DTW + KNN) excelled when sources displayed distinct overall profile 'shapes'. Ensemble models leveraged the complementary strengths of individual approaches, outperforming any single method. Incorporating simulated data corrected systematic underrepresentation of key life history phenotypes in real-world applications, improving model performance, population composition estimates, and their relevance for management decisions. Our results highlight the power of treating archival chemical data as time series, combined with machine learning and ensemble strategies, to enhance the accuracy, consistency, and scalability of provenance assignment.

The current study was conducted to determine the effect of methanol stem-bark extract of Erythrina senegalensis (MEES) on serum albumin level of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced liver damage in wistar rats. Method: Thirty wister rats of either sex weighing were randomly divided into six groups of five rats each. Group 1 served as the control received standard pelleted rat feed with normal distilled water. Group 2-6 were administered 30% CCl4 1ml/kg body weight in liquid paraffin at 72hrs interval. Group 2 was untreated while group 3 was orally treated with standard drug salymarin for 14days. Group 4-6 were orally treated respectively with 100, 300 and 500mg/kg body weight of the MEES. Result: The phytochemical analysis of the MEES indicated the presence of saponins, phenols, flavonoids, and tannins while the acute toxicity test showed no adverse reaction within the test population at a dose range of 200-2000mg/kg body weight. Unlike the control, inducement of CCL4 to Group2-6 indicated significant changes (p < 0.05) in the serum albumin level and hematological parameters. However, treatment with silymarin and increasing doses of the MEES restore the changes. The histopathological studies also reveal that increasing concentration of administered doses of the MEES significantly (p < 0.05) reduces cell necrosis around central vein.

Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of mortality in individuals with FRDA. To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying FRDA-associated cardiac dysfunction, we employed induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from three individuals with FRDA, each paired with an isogenic control line generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated excision of the pathogenic GAA repeat expansion. Correction of the mutation restored FXN expression to levels comparable to healthy donor iPSCs, and all lines differentiated efficiently into cardiomyocytes. Functional analysis revealed significant contractile abnormalities in FRDA cardiomyocytes and multicellular cardiac microtissues, including prolonged contraction and relaxation times and faster beating rates, consistent with clinical observations of cardiac contractile dysfunction. FRDA cardiomyocytes also exhibited pathological features such as increased cell size, irregular calcium transients, elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels, increased mitochondrial fission and increased cell death. These phenotypes were exacerbated by pathological levels of iron supplementation in culture media, highlighting the heightened sensitivity of frataxin-deficient cardiomyocytes to iron-induced metabolic stress.

However, the mechanistic link between PV neuron deficits, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological enhancement of phasic PV neuron activity markedly attenuates tau accumulation and neuronal loss in a tauopathy mouse model. We developed DSR-143630, a novel activator of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, selectively expressed in PV neurons. Administration of DSR-143630 alleviated febrile seizures in Nav1.1 haploinsufficient mice and suppressed high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), an electrophysiological signature of hyperexcitability associated with cognitive impairments, in rTg4510 tau transgenic mice. Longitudinal tau PET and volumetric MRI demonstrated that DSR-143630 treatment from 4 to 11 months of age profoundly reduced age-dependent tau deposition and atrophy in the neocortex and hippocampus. Postmortem analyses further revealed decreased levels of phosphorylated tau, preservation of neuronal populations, and attenuated neuroinflammatory responses, including reactive gliosis. These findings establish PV neuron dysfunctions and consequent network hyperexcitability as key drivers of tau pathogenesis and highlight pharmacological Nav1.1 activation as a promising disease-modifying strategy for neurodegenerative tauopathies.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Using this stream-lined model architecture, we investigate the ability of models pretrained on human genomic datasets to transfer performance to a variety of different tasks. Models pretrained on human data but fine-tuned on genomic datasets from diverse tissues and species achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy while significantly reducing training time compared to models trained from scratch, with Pearson correlation coefficients between experimental results and predictions as high as 0.8. Further, we found that including excessive training tasks decreased model performance and that this compromised performance could be partially but not completely rescued by fine-tuning.

However, one limitation of these approaches is that most require fusing the target protein with the enzyme that biotinylates nearby proteins (i.e., TurboID or APEX2), which risks sterically disrupting the protein's native function. Here, we present a method designed to reduce the steric impact of these fusions and offer greater flexibility in labelling modalities. The method, Antibody and Small-tag Assembly on Proteins for Interaction Detection (ASAP-ID), involves a bipartite system. Target proteins are fused to a small peptide antigen that recruits TurboID or APEX2 fused to an antibody directed to the antigen. Using two different antigen/antibody systems (SunTag and MoonTag), we show that ASAP-ID can specifically label human Lamin A in cells. The method works when the target protein and nanobody are co-expressed together in cis (ASAP-IDIC). We also demonstrate that the approach works when the antibody fusion is added in trans to fixed cells post-expression (ASAP-IDIT). ASAP-IDIT identified more than 448 known and previously undescribed interactors of lamin. We further used ASAP-IDIT to study how ALS-mutant profilin 1 affected its interactome. The method identified proteins involved in protein quality control that correlated with aggregation propensity. Moreover, the different mutants showed variation in the cellular location where aggregates formed. ASAP-IDIT revealed preferences for mitochondrial proteins for the two profilin mutants that tend to aggregate in the cytoplasm, C71G and M114T, and nuclear proteins for a mutant more prone to nuclear aggregation. These findings position ASAP-ID as a powerful addition to the proximity labelling toolkit, capable of probing subtle differences in interactomes in a less invasive manner.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

In task-based studies, this is often defined from pre-stimulus baselines, but for resting-state data the problem presents a fundamental challenge. Conventional solutions, such as empty-room recordings or diagonal white sensor noise, are not optimal. They either ignore brain-generated noise or yield artificial, non-uniform source-level baselines that can distort results. Our proposed approach is to define a baseline at the source level as a uniform distribution of uncorrelated, randomly oriented neural dipoles, representing a maximum-entropy 'ground state' of brain activity. Projecting this source model through the electromagnetic lead fields yields a sensor-level covariance that captures realistic spatial correlations. A data-driven constraint scales the model to match measured data, ensuring a physically admissible solution. Applied to real human resting-state data, the method produces a structured, non-uniform sensor covariance dictated by subject's anatomy, source reconstructions that are smooth and plausible, and free from the artificial peaks induced by diagonal noise models. This source-level approach provides a principled and physiologically grounded baseline for beamforming and improves the reliability of resting-state analyses and interpretation.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Despite its value as a noninvasive follicle visualization method, optical coherence microscopy (OCM) lacks sufficient spatial resolution, imaging depth, and noise suppression capabilities to resolve fine follicular structures in deep ovarian tissue. In this study, we applied speckle modulation to a wavelength-swept OCM optical system in the near-infrared region to visualize the fine structure of follicles distributed in deep tissues. OCM images of 4-day-old mice revealed dense superficial-layer distributions of primordial follicles. These follicles were distinguishable from primary follicles, which were surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells. In 14-day-old ovarian tissue, secondary follicles exhibited spatial dominance, and the fine structures constituting the follicles were successfully visualized. In ovarian tissues extracted from a patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the fine structures of primordial follicles were visualized to a depth of 300 m, and a comparison with HE staining revealed that follicle density varied significantly depending on the ovarian regions. Speckle modulation-assisted OCM visualized the microstructure of follicles with varying degrees of maturation in human ovaries at the depth necessary for clinical application.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) dysfunction serves as a link between obesity and CVD, promoting inflammatory and metabolic alterations that increase CVD risk. While EAT normally supports cardiac health, obesity-induced adipocyte hypertrophy triggers excessive fatty acid and cytokine release, driving myocardial lipotoxicity and inflammation that impair electrophysiology and metabolism, leading to beating irregularities, insulin resistance, and heart failure. The lack of sufficient EAT in small animal models and the impracticality of using large mammals hinder insights into the effects of EAT hypertrophy on the myocardium. To address this gap, a human-derived 3D bioprinted coculture of obese adipocytes and cardiomyocytes (CMs) is developed using patient-derived adipocytes and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived atrial CMs (a-iCMs).

The small GTPase Rab5, a key regulator of early endosomal dynamics, has been observed to localize to the surface of LDs, suggesting it may play a role in LD turnover. However, the regulation of Rab5-LD interactions and its functional consequences in HCC cell metabolism and proliferation have not been elucidated. In this study, we explored the role of Rab5 in governing LD homeostasis and its impact on HCC cell proliferation. We found that the GTP-bound (Q79L), active form of Rab5 exhibited increased association with LDs compared to the GDP-bound, inactive mutant (S34N). Nutrient starvation enhanced Rab5 GTP-loading and its recruitment to LDs, indicating that Rab5's GTPase cycle regulates its LD localization. Importantly, inhibition of Rab5 GTP-binding impaired LD catabolism, reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and significantly impaired HCC cell proliferation. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that RAB5 is significantly overexpressed in HCC patient samples, and this overexpression correlated with poorer overall survival. These findings demonstrate that Rab5's GTPase cycle is a critical regulator of LD dynamics in HCC cells, governing LD turnover to sustain mitochondrial energy production and support cancer cell proliferation.

K.; Mayer, B.; fassett, J.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin is an effective cancer chemotherapeutic, but its use is complicated by cardiotoxic side-effects. 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAr) is a widely used pharmacological activator of adenosine monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK), but also exerts AMPK-independent actions that may have unrealized therapeutic potential. Here, we identified a novel mechanism by which pretreatment with AICAr protects neonatal rat cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin toxicity. Despite increasing AMPKThr172 and ULK1Ser555 phosphorylation, AICAr suppressed cardiomyocyte LC3 lipidation and caused accumulation of the autophagy receptor, p62 SQST1, through an adenosine kinase (ADK)-dependent, AMPK-independent mechanism. The accumulation of p62 was associated with increased expression and transcriptional activity of NRF2, as well as decreased doxorubicin-induced reactive oxygen species and cell death. Notably, AICAr-induced increase of NRF2, antioxidant gene expression, and doxorubicin resistance were blocked by RNAi depletion of p62, indicating that the protective effects of AICAr rely upon the secondary effects of autophagy inhibition, rather than autophagy inhibition per se. While doxorubicin treatment alone did not affect cardiomyocyte LC3 lipidation, it did significantly decrease p62 levels and diminish NRF2 nuclear localization. Pretreatment with AICAr to provide surplus p62 and nuclear NRF2 diminished the impact of these doxorubicin effects. Importantly, MCF7 breast cancer cells, which poorly express ADK, were not protected by AICAr pretreatment and instead were sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cell death. These findings raise the possibility that differences in ADK expression between cardiomyocytes and breast cancer cells might be exploited by pretreatment with AICAr or similar ADK-dependent drugs to provide dual benefits in doxorubicin therapy.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Histological analyses of aortic valve tissues stratified into healthy and diseased cohorts based on degree of calcification reveal increased valve calcification area in diseased male aortic valves relative to female, and increased valve thickening in diseased female aortic valves. Single cell sequencing analysis of heterogeneous valvular interstitial cell (VIC) populations reveals male-dependent gene expression of the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex.

This functional difference was associated with an increase in the proportion of insulin-sensitizing, resident ATMs in SAT. In vivo and in vitro measurements of ATM growth and trafficking combined with single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that higher resident ATM survival and lower blood monocyte immigration along with decreased transition to pro-inflammatory ATMs collectively lead to the relative abundance of resident ATMs in SAT in obesity.

The prevailing explanation for the effect is that the illusory syllable is a consensus percept intermediate between otherwise incompatible auditory and visual representations. To test this idea, we turned to a deep neural network known as AVHuBERT that transcribes audiovisual speech with high accuracy. Critically, AVHuBERT was trained only with congruent audiovisual speech, without exposure to McGurk stimuli or other incongruent speech. In the current study, when tested with congruent audiovisual \"ba\", \"ga\" and \"da\" syllables recorded from 8 different talkers, AVHuBERT transcribed them with near-perfect accuracy, and showed a human-like pattern of highest accuracy for audiovisual speech, slightly lower accuracy for auditory-only speech, and low accuracy for visual-only speech.

To examine the individual variability that is hallmark of human perception of the McGurk effect, 100 variants of AVHuBERT were constructed.

Despite this crucial role Mg2+ has on brain health, its effect on the dynamics of networks of neurons is still not fully understood. This study investigates the impact of several doses of elevated extracellular Mg2+ on organotypic cultures. Cultures were recorded on a 512-microelectrode array and analyzed using the burstiness index (BI), the rate of network wide bursts relative to other neuronal activity. We also use a suite of information theoretic measures to further establish the role Mg2+ plays in the brain. Elevated Mg2+ is found to have a dose-dependent increase on BI caused by a loss of network activity not contained within a burst or high firing rate activity. Information dynamics further show that the network experiences a loss of entropy and an increase in time-reversibility, connectivity, and transfer of redundant information. These factors indicate that Mg2+ causes a loss of complex activity and an increase in highly integrated, constant dynamics. This lays the groundwork for a deeper examination of the role Mg2+ plays in learning, memory and treating neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

These parasites reside and replicate within a vacuole in host red blood cells. Egress of daughter parasites out of the vacuolar and host membranes is tightly regulated via a complex mechanism. Prior studies have suggested that a cyclic-GMP driven calcium signaling pathway leads to the signal-dependent exocytosis of egress-specific vesicles that discharge several proteases into the parasitophorous vacuole. However, signal-dependent exocytosis during egress has not yet been observed in live parasitized RBCs. We targeted the exocytosis reporter, superecliptic pHlourin or SEP, to these egress-specific vesicles and utilized time-lapse imaging to observe exocytosis in live P. falciparum parasites. The spatiotemporal relationship between exocytosis and the breakdown of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) as well as parasite egress was also determined using a fluorescent reporter targeted to the PVM. Our data showed that exocytosis is triggered as early as 3 hours prior to merozoite egress. These data suggest that the PVM rupture occurs at a single site and rapidly expands from that initial site of rupture, releasing the merozoites into the RBC. This is followed by RBC membrane rupture and egress of merozoites. Using conditional mutants of the P. falciparum endoplasmic reticulum calcium-binding protein (PfERC), we demonstrate that knockdown of PfERC inhibits signal-dependent exocytosis of egress-specific vesicles. Together, these data demonstrate that signal-dependent exocytosis of egress-specific vesicles starts well before merozoites are formed via cytokinesis, PVM ruptures at a single site, and that PfERC is required for exocytosis of egress-specific vesicles.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of the maternal allele of the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. UBE3A is imprinted with maternal-allelic expression in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) and biallelic expression in other cell types. Consequently, in Angelman syndrome, UBE3A is substantially reduced in CNS neurons and reduced by half in other cells. It is unclear how cell type-specific gene expression in the brain is dysregulated in Angelman syndrome, as previous studies have lacked cell type resolution. Using single nuclei RNA-sequencing, we show that gene expression is dysregulated in neuronal subtypes in the frontal cortex of neonatal pigs with a UBE3A maternal deletion. A total of 3,812 unique genes were dysregulated across ten cell type clusters, with most of the dysregulated genes (3,154 genes) in excitatory neurons. Pathway analysis revealed alterations in oxidative phosphorylation, proteasome function, and synaptic function. Additionally, somatostatin (SST) --a secreted neuropeptide involved in GABAergic inhibition and synaptic plasticity-- was reduced in inhibitory neurons in the cortex and hypothalamus, which correlated with lower circulating SST protein in neonates but not adolescent pigs. Overall, these findings provide greater clarity on the cell type-specific dysregulation of gene expression and cellular pathways caused by the loss of UBE3A in CNS neurons, expanding our understanding of the molecular pathology in Angelman syndrome.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

While the novel SDHI fungicide flubeneteram exhibits high efficacy against Pst, the molecular mechanisms governing resistance to both fungicides remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the ABC transporter PstABCG2 as a key mediator of multidrug resistance (MDR) through combined transcriptomic, genetic, and biochemical analyses. First, time-series transcriptomics revealed sustained upregulation of PstABCG2 under fungicide stress, with silencing via in planta RNAi and HIGS significantly enhancing Pst sensitivity to both triadimefon and flubeneteram. Heterologous expression of PstABCG2 in a Fusarium graminearum {Delta}FgABCG2 mutant restored fungicide tolerance, confirming its efflux function. Crucially, saturation mutagenesis and structural modeling pinpointed E1184 as a critical residue for fungicide binding: the E1184Y mutation disrupted triadimefon affinity (validated by MST/ITC, {Delta}G reduced from -7.1 to -6.5 kcal/mol) but minimally impacted flubeneteram binding due to adaptive halogen-bond networks. Furthermore, we discovered that the GATA-family transcription factor PstGATA directly activates PstABCG2 expression by binding to promoter cis-elements, and silencing PstGATA phenocopied the hypersensitivity of PstABCG2-silenced isolates.

However, qMRI processing can be complex, especially for users with limited coding experience. We introduce Resomapper, an open-source, cross-platform tool that integrates established processing libraries into a unified, user-friendly workflow, simplifying qMRI analysis while promoting accessibility, reproducibility, and data sharing. Materials and Methods: Resomapper is a Python-based pipeline designed for intuitive multiparametric MRI processing. It supports T1, T2, and T2* relaxometry, magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model fitting. The software includes advanced preprocessing options such as denoising, Gibbs artifact removal, and bias field correction. Users can process data interactively through a sequential pipeline or via an automated JSON-configured workflow, both executable through simple command-line instructions. Resomapper ensures compatibility by converting raw MRI data from different formats into the standardized NIfTI format within a BIDS-like structure, enhancing reproducibility, scalability, and data management efficiency. To demonstrate its application, we present a brain MRI study carried out on healthy, adult C57BL/6J mice, both sexes. MRI acquisitions were conducted on a Bruker Biospec 7T system using a multiparametric MRI protocol that included anatomical T2W images, T2 and T2* maps, MTI and DTI. The data were processed with Resomapper and co-registered using ANTsPy. Finally, a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis was performed to examine differences between sexes and brain areas, focusing on the cortex (Cx), hippocampus, (HPC), thalamus (Thal), and hypothalamus (HTH). Results: Differences in all MRI parameters were found across brain regions, as expected. Additionally, a small significant sex difference in T2* was observed, with higher values in the thalamus and hypothalamus of female mice compared to males. This may reflect sex-specific responses to anesthesia. Moreover, this study also serves as a reference for standardized multiparametric qMRI studies in mice using Resomapper. Conclusions: By integrating multiple processing tools into a single, accessible framework, Resomapper streamlines qMRI workflows and enables reproducible, high-quality image analysis. Thanks to its ability to handle diverse preprocessing techniques, multiple imaging modalities, and standardized data formats, the software proves to be a valuable resource for researchers with varying levels of programming expertise.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Previous theories have suggested these effects rely on the level of attention devoted to stimuli, magnitude of the stimulus dimension, or intensity of the population neural response, yet cannot account for the full range of experimental effects. Recently, we demonstrated that perceived time is affected by the image properties of scene clutter, size, and memorability (Ma, et al. 2024), with the former compressing and latter two dilating duration. Further, perceived duration also predicted recall of images 24h later, on top of memorability. To explain the memorability effect, we found that a recurrent convolutional neural network (rCNN) could recapitulate the time dilation effect by indexing the rate of entropy collapse, or \"speed\", across successive timesteps, with more memorable stimuli associated with faster speeds. Here, we replicate and extend these Wndings via three experiments (n=20ea.) where subjects performed a sub-second temporal bisection task using memorability stimuli with increasing memorability, but a constant speed (exp 1), increasing speed, but constant memorability (exp 2), or increasing in both (exp 3), each followed by a surprise memory test 24hr later. We found that either increasing memorability or speed alone led to time dilation effects, with faster/slower speeds shifting memory recall by ~8.4% in either direction. However, when both metrics increased, memorability dilated time while speed compressed it, while still improving recall overall. These Wndings can be explained by a model wherein the visual system is tuned to a preferred speed for processing stimuli that scales with the magnitude of visual response, such that stimuli closer to this speed are dilated in time. Overall, these Wndings provide a new lens for interpreting time dilation/compression effects and how visual stimuli are prioritized at temporal scales.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

By combining primary T-cell culture and a syngeneic mouse tumor model with both genome-wide and custom CRISPR/Cas9 screenings, we systematically identified genes and pathways that regulate PD-1 expression and functions of CD8+ T-cells. Among them, inactivation of a key enzyme in glycoconjugate biosynthesis, beta 1, 4-galatosyltransferase 1 (B4GALT1), leads to significantly enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) activation and functions of CD8+ T-cell. Interestingly, suppression of B4GALT1 enhances functions of TCR-T-cells, but has no effect on chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells. We systematically identified the substrates of B4GALT1 CD8+ T-cell surface by affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, which include protein components in both TCR and its co-receptor complexes. The galactosylation of TCR and CD8 leads to reduced interaction between TCR and CD8 that is essential for TCR activation. Artificially tethering TCR and CD8 by a TCR-CD8 fusion protein could bypass the regulation of B4GALT1 in CD8+ T-cells. Finally, the expression levels of B4GALT1 normalized to tumor infiltrated CD8+ T-cells in tumor microenvironment are significant and negatively associated with prognosis of human patients. Our results reveal the important roles of protein N-glycosylation in regulating functions of CD8+ T-cells and prove that B4GALT1 is a potential target for tumor immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that Reserpine, chronic inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), robustly extends lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster in a dose-dependent manner. However, reserpine-treated flies also exhibit reduced locomotor activity and impaired survival under acute heat stress, indicating a context-dependent trade-off between lifespan extension and stress resilience. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that reserpine induces a transcriptionally repressed, low-energy state characterized by downregulation of metabolic, immune, and stress-response genes in treated aged animals.

Using genome-wide analyses and CRISPR-based genome editing, we identified the tumor protein p63 as a key mediator of GR's tumor-suppressive chromatin activity. Loss of p63 reprograms GR activity toward an oncogenic state, marked by enhanced cell migration, invasion, and altered morphology. This shift is driven by increased GATA2 expression, which alters GR's chromatin binding and transcriptional output.

These widely-used methods require extensive manual parameter tuning, hindered by the combinatorial complexity of multiple parameters and heterogeneous sequencing data. To address this, we propose MRDadaptis, a novel SV detection tool that uniquely incorporates a self-adaptive parameter optimization mechanism. MRDadaptis distinguishes itself by integrating Bayesian optimization with meta-learning techniques to dynamically adjust detection parameters automatically, based on intrinsic features derived from the ctDNA sequencing data itself. This innovative approach not only reduces manual intervention but also effectively captures sample-specific characteristics, significantly improving detection stability and detection performance. Extensive validation experiments using both simulated and real-world ctDNA datasets demonstrates MRDadaptis distinct advantages, including markedly improved average F1-scores and superior stability (reduced variance, lower RMSE, increased kurtosis) These results highlight the significant advantages of MRDadaptis in addressing sample heterogeneity, underscoring its potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of MRD detecting through ctDNA analysis. https://github.com/aAT0047/MRDadaptis.git Keywords: structural variant detection, ctDNA, Self-Adaptive Parameter Configuration, Bayesian optimization, meta-learning, heterogeneous sequencing sample.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

This mathematical identity with the classical MM form can bias interpretation of fitted parameters and conceal mechanistic diversity. We show that variance in substrate energetics can shift KMapp and kcatapp as strongly as changes in mean binding or activation energies, making substrate heterogeneity an independent but hidden design axis. Numerical simulations of 500 coupled Michaelis-Menten reactions - each representing a distinct substrate - validated the closed-form expressions for the apparent parameters. Analysis of 43220 curated BRENDA entries quantified the kinetic spread in enzymology, and our framework shows that realistic substrate heterogeneity gives comparable variability.

In this study, we utilize protein engineering to create a series of novel peptide biosensors from the anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) nanopore by targeting its central phenylalanine clamp constriction (residue F427), a key site known to interact dynamically with translocating molecules. This series of engineered variants were evaluated for their performance in both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification of a diverse set of seven guest-host peptides. Intriguingly, we found that the engineered variants exhibited a broad range of unique biosensing and classification properties. There was a notable divergence between the ability of the variants to intrinsically separate peptides (unsupervised clustering) and their performance in supervised classification tasks. Notably, PA F427A nanopores showed enhanced specificity for small molecular weight peptides that were challenging for WT nanopores to classify, achieving exceptionally high performance (accuracy of 0.93). These findings challenge the assumption that a single unmodified biosensor is sufficient for complex discrimination. Instead, our results highlight the potential for a more robust approach: leveraging the unique, complementary strengths of multiple sensor variants in an ensemble or multiplexed array. Such a system can achieve high and balanced performance across diverse peptide classes, representing a significant step forward in the development of sophisticated nanopore biosensors.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell activation and bioenergetics, is a promising immunotherapy target for haematological malignancies. Disruption of CD38 expression using base editing prevented fratricide between T cells expressing anti-CD38 CAR (CAR38). Additional base editing enabled generation of a \"universal\" donor CAR38-T cells, devoid of endogenous TCRab and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules after disruption of T Cell Receptor Beta Constant (TRBC), Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and Regulatory Factor X5 (RFX5).

To determine whether NRDE2 may be implicated in other processes in humans, we performed tandem affinity purification followed by proteomic analysis of NRDE2 from nuclear extracts in HEK293T and HeLa cells. Our data show that, in addition to its well-characterized partner, MTR4 helicase (MTREX), as well as several splicing factors, NRDE2 also interacts with chromatin-associated factors involved in transcription, including the Polymerase-Associated Factor 1 (PAF1) complex and elongating forms of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). To further investigate the function of NRDE2 in gene expression, we performed RNA-seq following its transient depletion. Differential expression analysis showed that loss of NRDE2 modulated the expression of thousands of genes. While effects on splicing, including intron retention, were detected, as described previously, our analysis revealed that the impact of NRDE2 on intron retention is more widespread than previously thought. Moreover, intron retention was also highly associated with down-regulation of mRNA expression.

This study aimed to investigate the function of SUMOylation in CE-related hepatic fibrosis and evaluate the anti-fibrotic effects and mechanisms of ginkgolic acid (GA) via regulation of the SUMOylation pathway. Methodology Peri-lesional (PL) and adjacent normal (AN) liver tissues from CE patients were collected to examine histopathology and SUMO pathway proteins. A CE-infected mouse model was established and treated with GA to assess cyst burden, serum TGF-{beta}1 levels, hepatic fibrosis markers, and SUMO-related proteins. In vitro, macrophages and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs, LX-2 line) were stimulated with Echinococcus granulosus cyst fluid (EgCF) or TGF-{beta}1 to evaluate GAs effects on macrophage polarization (CD206/CD86), HSC activation (-SMA/PCNA), Smad4 SUMOylation, and nuclear translocation. Macrophage-HSC crosstalk was investigated via conditioned medium co-culture assays. Result Fibrosis was exacerbated in peri-lesional liver tissues of CE patients, accompanied by SUMO pathway activation. GA significantly alleviated hepatic fibrosis in CE mice and reversed SUMO pathway dysregulation. Mechanistically, GA inhibited EgCF-induced pro-fibrotic M2 macrophage polarization and blocked Smad4 SUMOylation and nuclear translocation by modulating SUMOylation. Furthermore, GA directly suppressed HSC activation and bidirectionally disrupted the pro-fibrotic crosstalk between macrophages and HSCs under EgCF stimulation, ultimately alleviating fibrosis. Conclusion This study reveals the critical role of SUMOylation modification in CE-associated hepatic fibrosis and elucidates a novel anti-fibrotic mechanism whereby GA targets the SUMOylation-Smad4 axis to regulate the immune microenvironment.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Chromatin remodeling is thought to play a role in enabling this transcriptional response, but the specific mechanisms remain unclear. In Drosophila, a transcriptional trace of courtship LTM training can be observed in the mushroom body (MB) during the memory consolidation phase after the end of training. Here, we investigated the role of Bap60, a core subunit of the Drosophila SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in the transcriptional trace of memory consolidation. Adult-specific knockdown of Bap60 in the MB selectively impaired LTM with short-term memory (STM) left intact. Transcriptome analysis of Bap60 knockdown MBs following courtship LTM training revealed near complete disruption of LTM training induced transcription in the MB. MB-specific CUT&RUN was used to map SWI/SNF binding sites and identify over 100 candidate direct Bap60-dependent training induced genes. Bap60 was not required for training induced activation of immediate early genes (IEGs), Hr38 and Sr, which are transcription factors that are critical for courtship LTM. This suggests that Bap60 may regulate LTM gene induction downstream of IEGs. Interestingly, we identified Sr binding sites at 30% of Bap60-dependent training induced genes. Many of these target genes were transcription factors, including Prospero (Pros), which we show is also required in the MB for LTM but not STM. Interestingly, Pros is induced in a subset of MB nuclei, suggesting Bap60 is involved in cell specific LTM training induced gene activation. Together, these findings reveal a critical role for Bap60, a core SWI/SNF subunit, as a key regulator of LTM training-induced transcription downstream of IEGs.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

M. tuberculosis is a classic example of this, where ample studies have provided evidence of how the transcriptional regulators are involved in various survival mechanisms in the bacterium. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a well-known pathogen due to the emergence of drug resistance associated with it, and the genome of M. tuberculosis encodes many transcriptional regulators. Our work explicates the mechanism of K+/ Na+ mediated oligomerization and DNA binding of MoyR. In vitro assays revealed a complex pattern of MoyR oligomerization depending on monovalent cation concentrations where MoyR tends to form tetramers and hexamers which directly affect the MoyR affinity to its cognate DNA. The tetramer bound DNA was found to be highly stable even at high monovalent cation concentrations such as 500 mM which is unusual for a protein-DNA binding in a mesophilic bacteria. GntR proteins are substantially known to bind the DNA as homodimers in a two-fold symmetry, but this study is the second, that reports of a tetrameric GntR protein assembly after the GntR regulator Atu1419 in Agrobacterium fabrum. MoyR binds with high affinity (Kd,app = 3.47 nM) and specificity to the shared promoter region between the divergently oriented Rv0789c-Rv0790c-Rv0791c-moyR operon and Rv0793. The moyR gene cluster was identified as a conserved region and most of the adjacent genes are homologous to monooxygenases which highly likely to be likely to be implicated in a polyketide antibiotic synthesis pathway of the bacterium and this can provide a novel paradigm to the antibiotic tolerance and resistance of M. tuberculosis wherein this elicits the importance of MoyR as a drug target.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Herein we examine the miRNA regulation of OGT by the human miRNAome using our high-throughput miRFluR assay. We found >200 miRNA regulators of OGT, including 17 down- and 15 upregulatory miRNAs previously identified in CLIP datasets. We validated the impact of select miRNA on OGT and O-GlcNAc levels using both miRNA mimics and inhibitors that reduce endogenous miRNA levels. We focused our studies on two miRNA families, the downregulatory let-7 family and the upregulatory miR-148/152 family. For the let-7 family, we found that only let-7a-3p and let-7g-3p strongly downregulated OGT. Downregulation required two seed-dependent binding sites. Evolutionary analysis found that the more recent of the two sites emerged in placental mammals. A similar conservation pattern was observed for the site of regulation by the miR-148/152 family, which was previously identified in CLIP datasets. All three miRNA in this family upregulated OGT. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this upregulatory site has been conserved for the past 98.7 million years. The emergence of these regulatory sites correlates with that of disease states that both OGT and the miRNA are known to impact.

It remains unclear whether this extends to the within-host physiological environment and what the consequences are for reinfecting pathogens. Here, we asked whether prior pathogen exposure of hosts induces gene expression heterogeneity in the host and/or pathogen during infection. We quantified gene expression in vivo following high-dose pathogen challenge of house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) previously given controlled, varied exposure histories to a bacterial pathogen (Mycoplasma gallisepticum; MG). To measure gene expression heterogeneity, we collected transcriptomic data from two host tissues (conjunctiva and spleen), and, simultaneously, from pathogen infecting the primary site of infection (conjunctiva). In the conjunctiva, but not the spleen, prior pathogen exposure induced significant heterogeneity in host gene expression relative to pathogen-naive hosts. Further, hosts that received a lower prior exposure dose rather than a higher primary dose showed the greatest within-group heterogeneity in expression during re-challenge. Functional enrichment analyses for significantly variable host genes indicated an over-representation of terms involved in the immune system response to pathogens, namely a diversified inflammatory response, in birds with prior pathogen exposure. The infecting pathogen from the conjunctiva followed similar patterns of heterogeneity in host gene expression, where pathogen infecting hosts with prior exposure had more heterogeneous expression than those infecting pathogen-naive hosts. While the exact mechanisms that underlie greater variation in gene expression cannot be resolved by this study, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that prior host exposure induces a within-host environment that promotes heterogeneous gene expression across both hosts and pathogens. This suggests that to understand the coevolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases we must consider not only the genetic sequence variation, but also gene expression variation in host and pathogen.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we present time-resolved single-particle cryo-EM structures of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophytochrome (PaBphP) captured at multiple time points during dark reversion from Pr to Pfr. We identify structural asymmetries in the precursor Pr state stretching from the homodimer interface to a conserved histidine (H277) next to the bilin and find that these lead to a strong imbalance of the dark reversion reaction rate of the two protomers. Supported by molecular modelling, we conclude that small, protomer-dependent changes of the conserved histidine control the hydrogen-bonding network around the chromophore, thereby exerting control over the activation energy of the isomerization reaction.

AAV based CAR T therapy addresses these challenges by providing stable and safe CAR delivery with low integration risk, enhancing persistence while reducing insertional mutagenesis concerns. AAVCD4CAR transduced primary human T cells at high efficiency and viability; the resulting CAR T cells selectively recognized and killed HIV1 infected CD4+ T cells, significantly reducing viral p24 levels in infected PBMC cultures.

R2 non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons integrate via target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) specifically targeting the 25S ribosomal DNA multicopy site and enabling double-strand-break-free installation of gene-sized DNA sequences. We adapted the avian Taeniopygia guttata R2 protein (R2Tg) for targeted DNA insertion into plant genomes through engineering of R2Tg expression cassettes and RNA payloads carrying intron-disrupted mCherry and RUBY retrotransposition reporters with length-optimized rDNA homology arms. These efforts, together with optimized construct delivery formats and incubation temperatures, define R2 editor design rules enabling efficient DNA integration and functional protein expression from the 25S rDNA locus. In Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts, and Solanum lycopersicum seedlings, the optimized R2Tg editor system achieved targeted insertion with efficiencies up to 24% payloads ranging in size from 2kb to 5kb. This work establishes a compact R2Tg ribonucleoprotein platform for targeted DNA insertion into plant genomes, targeting a multicopy genomic safe harbor site to enable efficient multi-kilobase gene addition", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

However, viral diversity and evolution associated with this archaeal lineage, especially for extremophilic Thaumarchaea and Aigarchaea, remain uncharacterized. Here, we reveal the neglected diversity of the Thaumarchaea virome by identifying 152 species-level viral and mobile genetic element (MGE) sequences associated with extremophilic Thaumarchaea, which mainly colonize in hyperthermophilic environments, deep sea, and acidic soils. Importantly, we identified 263 previously unrecognized species-level viral/MGE sequences associated with Aigarchaea, including a novel rod-shaped viral family uniquely characterized by capsid heterodimers, thereby filling a long-standing gap in the viral diversity of the TACK super-phylum. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close evolutionary relationships between Aigarchaea-associated rod-shaped viruses and Methanophagales (ANME-1) rod-shaped viruses, suggesting that they may have evolved from a common rod-shaped viral ancestor. In contrast, Aigarchaea-associated head-tailed viruses formed three distinct monophyletic clades compared to other viruses, representing previously undiscovered evolutionary lineages within virosphere. Gene functional analysis identified 32 viral-encoded genes potentially involved in supplementing host metabolism, including, for the first time, genes that confer selective advantages to their extremophilic archaeal hosts, such as those involved in oxidative stress adaptation and antibiotic synthesis. Approximately 54% of 6,505 horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) occur bidirectionally between Nitrososphaerota and viruses/MGEs, highlight the significant role of viruses/MGEs in facilitating gene exchange within the archaeal communities.

The insertion of the endotracheal tube (ETT) compromises the host bronchial defenses and facilitates the formation of microbial biofilms and VAP. Although antibiotics remain the cornerstone treatment, their efficacy is often compromised by poor biofilm penetration and the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. This reveals the need to develop novel non-antibiotic therapeutic strategies. We engineered a non-pathogenic strain of the pulmonary bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae CV2 to express anti-biofilm and bactericidal enzymes (VAP platform). The therapeutic effect was validated in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and ex vivo in ETTs of patients with P. aeruginosa-induced VAP. We evaluated the safety of an improved version of CV2 (CV8, Mycochassis) in a miniature pig model, and its efficacy with the VAP therapeutic platform (CV8_VAP) in a piglet model of P. aeruginosa-induced VAP. CV8_VAP was administered via intralobe instillation or nebulization. We assessed the platform ability to degrade biofilms formed on ETTs in vivo and its impact on the airway microbiota. We evaluated bacterial load in the lungs, inflammatory responses, histopathological and the clinical outcomes to provide a comprehensive characterization of therapeutic efficacy and safety. VAP platform reduced biofilm thickness and P. aeruginosa load in ETTs and lungs, with the nebulized route showing enhanced efficacy. CV8_VAP contributed on microbiome diversity restoration. Inflammatory markers in the lung were markedly decreased, suggesting a local immunomodulatory effect. These findings support that CV8_VAP as a promising, non-antibiotic therapeutic strategy for treating VAP caused by P. aeruginosa.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

The infection outcome depends on the complex interplay between insect immune defenses and fungal adaptive strategies. However, how host immune effectors contribute to resist fungi with different ecological strategies remains incompletely understood. In this study, we employ Drosophila melanogaster as a genetically tractable model to dissect immune defenses against diverse fungal pathogens. Our study uncovers that the Toll pathway is the key determinant of immunity against all species tested regardless of their ecological strategy, primarily through resistance mechanisms that limit fungal proliferation. In addition, melanization, but not phagocytosis or the Imd pathway, also has a role in limiting fungal entry and proliferation. Additionally, we show that fungal protease detection by Persephone has a quantitatively more critical role than the glucan sensor GNBP3 in the activation of the Toll pathway upon fungal infection. Our study also reveals that the fly-specific obligate fungus Entomophthora muscae employs a vegetative development strategy, protoplasts, to hide from the host immune response. These findings reveal that Drosophila immune mechanisms effectively defend against a broad range of fungal pathogens with various ecological lifestyles, while highlighting striking adaptations to overcome these defenses in highly specialized fungal pathogens.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Phages counteract bacterial immune signaling using sponge proteins that bind and sequester the immune signals, but the breadth of immune signals targeted by phage sponges is unclear. Here we study the functional versatility of Acb2, Tad1 and Tad2, three families of sponge proteins known to inhibit CBASS and Thoeris signaling. Eighty-four proteins representing the phylogenetic diversity of these sponge families were tested for their ability to inhibit immunity by sequestering 3'3'-cGAMP and 3'3'-cUA (CBASS), cCMP and cUMP (Pycsar), and 3'cADPR, His-ADPR and N7-cADPR (types I, II and IV Thoeris, respectively). While Acb2 proteins were so far reported to inhibit only CBASS systems, we found Acb2 homologs that bind 3'cADPR and inhibit Thoeris defense. In addition, we discovered sponge proteins that inhibit Pycsar and type IV Thoeris by binding cUMP and N7-cADPR, respectively. Using crystal structures, structural modeling and biochemical analyses, we explain the molecular basis for signal-binding specificities in members of these sponge families.

It is orchestrated by over 200 ribosome assembly factors and 75 small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), which guide site-specific chemical modifications of precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA). While canonical box C/D snoRNPs direct 2'-O-methylation, the atypical box C/D snoRNPs snR4 and snR45 mediate acetylation of 18S rRNA residues C1280 and C1773, respectively, catalyzed by the acetyltransferase Kre33. Here, we identify and characterize Ynl050c/Sni445 as a novel ribosome assembly factor and previously unrecognized auxiliary component of the snR4 and snR45 box C/D snoRNPs. Sni445 associates with snR4 and snR45 in their free form and is required for their stable incorporation into 90S pre-ribosomes. Genetic interactions link Sni445 and the snR4 and snR45 snoRNAs to ribosomal proteins Rps20 (uS10) and Rps14 (uS11), which are positioned near the respective acetylation sites in the 40S subunit. Moreover, Sni445 physically interacts with Kre33 within the 90S pre-ribosome, and its absence abolishes acetylation of C1280 and C1773. Our findings suggest that Sni445 facilitates the recruitment of snR4 and snR45 snoRNPs to 90S particles and might promote their interaction with Kre33, thereby enabling the site-specific acetylation of 18S rRNA by Kre33.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

To allow translation to the clinic we evaluated the therapeutic effects of hiEVs for osteoarthritis treatment. Specifically, we assessed the efficacy of hiEVs collected from serum-containing and serum-free, PurStem (PS), media in an OA mice model. Methods: hiEVs were administered with or without hydrogel via intra-articular (i.a.) injection in a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model. Fluorescence imaging was used to monitor the retention of IR780-labeled hiEVs in the joint cavity. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by analyzing damage scores as well as catabolic and anabolic markers, including Mmp13 and Col2 expression, in joint tissues. Results: Fluorescence imaging confirmed that hiEVs remained localized at the injection site without systemic migration. HiEVs demonstrated significant protective effects against joint tissue degeneration in the DMM mouse OA model, as evidenced by reduced damage scores, decreased Mmp13 expression, and increased anabolic processes (Col2 expression). The hydrogel alone also exerted beneficial therapeutic effects, including reduced damage scores, increased Col2 expression, and reduced Mmp13 levels; however, these effects were notably smaller than those achieved with hiEV treatment while it was independent of the medium used for hiEV collection. Conclusions: Together, our findings demonstrate that hiEVs from xeno-free conditions effectively prevent cartilage degradation and promote its repair. This paves the way for future clinical translation of hiEV-based therapies as a safe, scalable, and effective approach to treat osteoarthritis.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

These efforts have led to a stable classification of the group into suborders and infraorders. However, several taxa, such as the genus Argynnia, remain unplaced due to ambiguous morphology and unresolved positions in single-gene phylogenies. In this study, we explore the diversity of Argynnia by presenting new records of species sampled across Brazil. To address its longstanding taxonomic uncertainty, we performed a phylogenomic analysis incorporating transcriptomic data from the Protist 10,000 Genomes isolate P10K-MW-000941 (P10K941). Through single-gene phylogenies, this isolate was shown to be closely related to Argynnia, which previously lacked genomic-level data. Here, we further confirm this relationship and present a 227-gene phylogenomic reconstruction that identifies the placement of P10K941 within Arcellinida, thereby resolving the phylogenetic placement of Argynnia. We obtained a curated, contaminant-free phylogenomic dataset for Arcellinida, including the P10K941, through the PhyloFisher workflow. Our analysis recovers P10K941 as a well-supported long-branch, sister to the infraorder Longithecina. Given this phylogenomic placement, along with Argynnia's characteristic morphology and the consistent results of single-marker analyses placing it outside existing infraorders, we propose the Pyrumthecina infraorder novum and the family Argynniidae family novum to accommodate the P10K941 isolate and all Argynnia species. These findings resolve the phylogenetic position of Argynnia and allow for interpreting shell evolution and deep diversification patterns within Arcellinida. The recognition of Pyrumthecina also highlights the likely existence of deeply branching lineages among arcellinid taxa currently classified as incertae sedis.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

While Cu(II) reduction is commonly attributed to unfolded or amyloid proteins, here we show that the well-folded plasma protein human serum albumin (HSA) intrinsically reduces Cu(II) to Cu(I) in the absence of external reductants. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), circular dichroism (CD) and computational modelling (QM/MM and DFT), we identify a redox mechanism involving the disulphide bond Cys392-Cys438 in domain III of HSA. Cu binding at the high-affinity ATCUN motif triggers conformational changes that expose this disulphide bond, enabling thiol-mediated electron transfer and Cu(I) formation. Chelation with tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) impairs this reduction by restricting access to the reactive disulphide site. Comparative analysis with other globular proteins reveals that Cu reduction requires both accessible disulphide motifs and a native folded structure. Simulations and spectroscopy of SOD1 confirm that disulphide cleavage enhances Cu-thiolate interaction, supporting a generalizable two-site redox mechanism. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mode of protein-mediated copper reduction and suggest broader physiological roles for disulphide-regulated redox switching in metal homeostasis.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of extracts and silver nanoparticles synthesised using bacterial endophytes isolated from Cola acuminata and Cola nitida roots. Methodology: The roots of each plant were harvested, washed, cut and surface sterilised. The sterile pieces were placed on the surface of nutrient agar and incubated, after which the microorganisms were sub-cultured until pure colonies were obtained. Secondary metabolite production was then undertaken over a 12-day fermentation period in Mueller Hinton Broth, conducted under stringent aseptic conditions. Each microorganism was fermented in two different tanks. The first was used for the preparation of crude extracts, and the second for the synthesis of nanoparticles. The in vitro antibacterial activity was determined using the broth microdilution method against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and Escherichia coli. The MIC and the time-kill kinetic were used to determine the inhibiting parameters. The endophytes that produced the most promising effects were identified using microscopy and MALDI-TOF techniques.

To this end, our workflow first identifies relatively conserved short stretches (36-nt) within all DENV genomes, which could potentially serve as triggers that activate Toehold RNA sensors. We then add a crucial step of mismatch-tolerance that allows related triggers with high sequence diversity and multiple mismatches in the sensor-binding region to be efficiently sensed by the same sensor. The sensitivity of the Toehold sensor assay is often increased by inclusion of an isothermal RNA amplification step. We show by employing multiple primer sets that diverse trigger RNAs from all four serotypes of the dengue virus can be successfully amplified and subsequently detected by the same sensor.

To understand larval habitat characteristics for Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), we quantified microbial community carbon flows based on growth and grazing rates from depth profiles of dilution incubations and carbon biomass assessments from microscopy and flow cytometry (FCM) during their peak spawning off NW Australia (Indian Ocean) in February 2022. Two Chla-based estimates of phytoplankton production gave differing offsets due to cycling or mixotrophy, exceeding 14C net community production on average (677 versus 447 mg C m-2 d-1). Productivity was higher than in the Gulf of Mexico spawning area for Atlantic Bluefin Tuna but less than similar studies of oceanic upwelling regions. Microzooplankton grazing averaged 482 mg C m-2 d-1 (71% of production). Two measurement variables for Prochlorococcus gave average production and grazing rates of 282 and 248 mg C m-2 d-1 (86 grazed). Prochlorococcus comprised almost half of production and grazing fluxes in the upper (0-25 m) euphotic zone where SBT larvae reside.

The male bias was classically considered a consequence of the higher number of cell divisions in the male germline, but recently multiple lines of evidence find this to be an inadequate explanation. The revived damage-induced hypothesis posits that males are either more prone to germline damage or less likely to repair damage, leading to more mutations. The model predicts that, when males and females are treated with approximately equal levels of mutagenic stress, the male germline will accumulate more mutations. Here we provide the first test of the damage hypothesis by exposing male and female mice to mutagenic chemicals with both untreated and a non-mutagenic (PBS) controls, assaying de novo mutations via parent-offspring whole-genome sequencing. As predicted, in the instances where the mutagens caused a net increase to the mutation rate, it went up more in male germline. Comparison with established mutational signatures reveals differential involvement of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Similarly, transcriptome analysis finds higher expression levels of DNA repair genes in ovary compared to testis for those genes in the BER pathway, a difference that becomes more extreme on administration of mutagens. As parental age, hence number of germline cell divisions, is controlled, we conclude that the male mutation bias is, at least in part, owing to differential damage repair with lower base excision repair in males playing a significant role.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

Using long-read 16S rRNA gene sequencing, diet metabarcoding, and whole-genome host data, we show that gut microbiome diversity aligns with predictions of island biogeography theory rather than host colonization history, revealing that microbial dispersal limitation independent of the host is a dominant mechanism of community assembly. Geography and diet primarily explain bacterial presence-absence patterns, whereas host genetic differentiation and heterozygosity influence abundant, potentially resident taxa. Challenging previous assumptions about birds, we detect clear signals of phylosymbiosis (i.e. similar microbiome composition among closely related hosts), however phylogenetic reconciliation reveals these associations result from convergent host filtering of environmentally acquired bacteria, likely via shared diets or physiological traits, rather than detectable co-diversification.

CiliaHub identified 2011 experimentally supported ciliary genes, including 1323 not previously listed in curated databases. Notably, some of these genes are co-found in both cilia and other organelles, such as mitochondria and lysosomes. Cross-referencing with mouse knockout model data revealed strong associations with ciliopathy-relevant phenotypes, such as infertility in Cep70 and renal defects or hearing abnormalities in genes like TMEM145. This work also provides novel ciliopathy candidate genes for further investigation. CiliaHub provides a broad platform for fundamental and translational research, enabling the effective prioritization of candidate disease genes, including recently identified ciliopathy candidates.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

J.; Villanueva, C. M.; Barandon, P. L.; Grafton, S. T.; Lapate, R. C.", "abstract": "Emotional processing is ubiquitous in everyday life, informing goal pursuit not only in response to current demands, but also in anticipation of future outcomes. Lateral prefrontal (LPFC) function supports cognitive control, and emerging evidence suggests a unique role for its anterior-most region -the lateral frontal pole (FPl) - in integrating putatively amygdala-originated emotion signals with goal information. However, whether these organizational properties of LPFC are expressed during the anticipation of future threat remains unknown. Here, we used FIR modeling and pattern similarity analysis to examine dynamic engagement and representational properties of distinct LPFC regions during threat anticipation requiring goal-directed action. Healthy participants (n=67) were scanned during a threat-of-shock paradigm consisting of a prolonged (18s) countdown to possible shock administration. Threat unpleasantness and controllability were manipulated orthogonally: in controllable trials, participants could avoid an unpleasant or mild shock by making a successful time-sensitive response; in uncontrollable trials, shocks were administered regardless of performance. LPFC robustly coded for anticipated threat unpleasantness, with FPl showing the strongest modulation by threat unpleasantness and controllability relative to caudal and mid-LPFC regions. Caudal and mid-LPFC maintained independent representations of threat unpleasantness and controllability. In contrast, FPl held conjunctive threat-and-controllability representations, which were associated with successful motor performance following anticipation of unpleasant shocks. Stronger conjunctive FPl representations were also associated with greater inverse amygdala-FPl coupling. Together, these findings provide insight into LPFC organization under naturalistic emotional challenges and highlight a key role for FPl in integrating affective and control-related information during threat anticipation to support goal-directed action.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

G.; Abbott, L.", "abstract": "In biological neural circuits, the dynamics of neurons and synapses are tightly coupled. We study the consequences of this coupling and show that it enables a novel form of working memory. In recurrent neural network models with ongoing Hebbian plasticity, we find that, following oscillatory stimulation, neurons continue to oscillate long after the input is removed. This creates a dynamic form of memory that has no explicit storage or retrieval phases and that requires no prior knowledge of the input. We trace the mechanism of these \"persistent oscillations'' to an interaction between neurons and synapses that creates complex outlier eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix. This is shown both in simulation and analytically. We leverage this mechanistic understanding to generate persistent oscillations with prespecified dynamics, creating a dynamic analog of a classical Hopfield network. Our work demonstrates that coupling neuronal and synaptic dynamics enables novel forms of computation.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms underlying the directional cilia orientation and reverse movement are unknown. Here we show that the primary cilia of pyramidal neurons are localized near the base of the apical dendrites and aligned on the nuclear side opposite to the axon initial segment. However, this pattern is not observed in atypical pyramidal neurons in the deep neocortex, excitatory neurons in non-laminated brain regions, interneurons, or astrocytes, where their cilia are irregularly positioned around the nuclei and lack preferred orientation. In Reelin-deficient mice (reeler), the directional orientation and apical localization of cilia in late-born neocortical and CA1 neurons are partially impaired, because their initial impairments are partially corrected during late postnatal development, along with a realignment of apical-basal orientation. In contrast, loss of Reelin drastically disrupts the directional orientation of primary cilia in early-born neocortical neurons and principal neurons in the piriform cortex; consistently, their cilia and centrioles do not preferably localize to the base of the apical dendrites. Additionally, Reelin deficiency increases the cilia length of principal neurons in the cerebral cortex after P14 when WT cilia stabilize, but not in interneurons, astrocytes, or excitatory neurons in non-laminated regions. Together, Reelin controls the directional orientation, intracellular localization, and length of primary cilia in principal neurons in the cerebral cortex. These results underscore primary cilia as a key apical unit, particularly prominent in late-born neurons.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

E.; Rashighi, M.; Garber, M.", "abstract": "Photosensitivity is central to cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and dermatomyositis (DM), but the mechanisms linking UVB exposure to tissue-specific autoimmunity are poorly defined. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, UVB provocation, and in vitro modeling, we identify MMP9 CD14 myeloid cells as critical mediators of photosensitivity. These cells expand significantly in lesional skin, produce IFN-b, and colocalize with cytotoxic CD4 T cells at the dermal-epidermal junction. Keratinocytes activate fibroblasts in the superficial dermis, prompting them to release chemokines (CCL2, CCL19, CCL7, CCL8, CXCL12) that recruit MMP9 CD14 cells. IFN-I-primed keratinocytes exposed to UVB release cytokines activating dendritic cells, mirroring in vivo responses. UVB irradiation of non-lesional DM skin rapidly recruits these myeloid cells. In a clinical proof-of-concept study, anti-IFN-I treatment with anifrolumab prevented UVB-induced myeloid infiltration and reduced photosensitivity. Thus, targeting MMP9 CD14 cells may offer therapeutic potential for managing photosensitive autoimmune skin conditions.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}

C.; Coraca-Huber, D. C.; Ausserlechner, M. J.; Romanelli, A.; Marx, F.", "abstract": "Candida albicans, a commensal and opportunistic fungal pathogen, is a major clinical concern due to its ability to cause infections ranging from mild mucosal conditions to life-threatening systemic diseases, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Its capacity to form biofilms on medical devices further complicates treatment by enhancing antifungal resistance and immune evasion. In the search for novel therapeutic strategies, the lysine-enriched amphibian-derived temporin B analog, TB_KKG6K, has emerged as a promising antifungal agent. This study demonstrates that TB_KKG6K exhibits potent activity against planktonic C. albicans cells, with a low potential to induce adaptation or resistance, even after prolonged exposure. TB_KKG6K has no adverse impact on the anti-Candida efficacy of standard antifungal drugs like amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole or 5-flucytosine, when applied in combination. Additionally, TB_KKG6K effectively reduces biofilm maturation on silicone elastomers, a material commonly used in medical devices, further highlighting its therapeutic potential. These data together with our previous documentation of minimal cytotoxicity and irritation potential in human cells, makes TB_KKG6K a strong candidate for combating both planktonic and biofilm-associated C. albicans infections. These findings underscore the dual efficacy of TB_KKG6K and its potential to address the challenges posed by C. albicans in clinical settings.", "date": "2025-08-24", "journal": ""}
