Current structural knowledge of the trimeric spike protein relies on truncated recombinant proteins and/or inactivated full-length forms, which may suffer from overstabilization. Here, we apply cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) at a Biosafety Level 3 facility to study the virus structure in its native, active state. The virus particles exhibit variable shapes and sizes with diffusible spikes, with the majority in typical prefusion conformations. Notably, we identified unprecedented, a transient open-trimer prefusion states, revealing a hidden flexibility with opened S1 conformation. Subtomogram averaging of the prefusion spikes indicates a loosely packed trimeric architecture that may facilitate the formation of open-trimer state. A cryo-EM map of recombinant Omicron BA.2.75 spike protein further confirms the presence of this loosely packed trimer as a minor conformational state. The observed dynamics uncover conserved cryptic regions that can be targeted for broadly effective vaccines.

Here, we report that cancer cells endowed with high metastatic ability and cancer stem cell-like traits employ ether lipids to maintain low membrane tension and high membrane fluidity. Using genetic approaches and lipid reconstitution assays, we show that these ether lipid-regulated biophysical properties permit non-clathrin-mediated iron endocytosis via CD44, resulting in significant increases in intracellular redox-active iron and enhanced ferroptosis susceptibility. Using a combination of in vitro three-dimensional microvascular network systems and in vivo animal models, we show that loss of ether lipids from plasma membranes also strongly attenuates extravasation, metastatic burden and cancer stemness.

The GluN3A subunit, which forms non-classic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), is enriched in the hippocampal CA1 subregion and has a poorly understood functional role, especially in stress-related behavioral regulation. Here, we employed chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and GluN3A knockout (KO) mouse models combined with behavioral, molecular, genetic, pharmacological, and circuit-level analyses to investigate the role of hippocampal GluN3A in stress coping. We found that CSDS selectively reduced GluN3A expression in the intermediate CA1 (CA1i) region. Decreased GluN3A expression in CA1i, from either stress or genetic deletion, promoted passive coping behaviors, whereas overexpression of GluN3A in CA1i reversed the phenotype under both conditions. Mechanistically, consistent with GluN3A enrichment in pyramidal neurons, c-fos staining and fiber photometry revealed that GluN3A was essential for CA1i pyramidal neuronal activation during coping behaviors. Further chemogenetic manipulations demonstrated that activating CA1i neurons facilitated active coping, while inhibition induced passivity. Moreover, local administration of D-serine, an agonist of GluN3A-containing NMDARs, rapidly shifted coping behavior from passive to active by activating CA1i neurons via GluN3A-dependent mechanisms. Circuit tracing revealed that CA1i neurons project to multiple sub-hippocampal and cortico-limbic regions, and GluN3A overexpression selectively enhanced downstream neuronal activity in CA3 and infralimbic cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens. Together, these findings identify GluN3A as a key molecule linking hippocampal subregional specialization with adaptive stress coping, and suggest that the rapid, resilience-promoting effects of D-serine are also GluN3A-dependent.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, CAMBUS revealed cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory landscapes, linking genetic constraint with gene regulation in immune cells and identifying plausible connections between 1,533 causal variants and 70 complex traits.

We studied the consequences of EPB41L4A-AS1 perturbation in breast cancer cells and found that it acts both in cis, to enhance transcription of the proximal EPB41L4A gene and additional genes in its two flanking topologically associated domains, and in trans by broadly regulating gene expression, including expression of snoRNAs, transcription of genes involved in nucleolar biology and the distribution of nucleolar proteins. These effects are phenocopied by the loss of SUB1, an interactor of EPB41L4A-AS1, and are observed following transient perturbations of EPB41L4A-AS1 that do not affect steady-state SNORA13 levels or the rRNA modification it helps install. Exogenous expression of the full-length EPB41L4A-AS1 locus but not SNORA13 expression can rescue the trans-acting transcriptional effects of its perturbation.

Methods: Utilising cardiac tissues from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and C57BL/6J mice, we combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolic profiling, non-targeted 1H NMR spectroscopy, and in silico computational modelling using the genome-scale mammalian network CardioNet. Main Findings: Our analyses revealed that bat hearts exhibit a distinct metabolic profile characterised by depleted glycogen reserves and increased reliance on lipid oxidation to meet energy demands. Notably, bat hearts displayed elevated fluxes in oxidative phosphorylation, beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, and the Krebs cycle, alongside reduced amino acid catabolism. These findings suggest that bats have evolved unique metabolic strategies to support the high-energy demands of flight, maintaining cardiac function without succumbing to pathological remodelling. Conclusions: This study provides the first comprehensive insight into the metabolic adaptations in the cardiac tissue of a bat species, contributing to our understanding of how these mammals endure extreme physiological stresses. Integrating metabolomics with computational modelling offers a powerful approach to studying metabolic adaptations in non-model species, potentially informing therapeutic strategies for human cardiac conditions.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

A fundamental challenge for this computation is parallax: as the animal moves, the direction of nearby landmarks shifts, potentially introducing systematic, position-dependent errors. Whether and how the HD system corrects for parallax has remained unclear. Here we show that the HD signal in the postsubiculum of freely moving mice exhibits position-dependent biases consistent with parallax in a single-cue environment. These biases were smaller than predicted by geometric calculation of parallax, and in more natural, multi-cue settings the bias was strongly attenuated. Using computational modeling, we further show that two passive effects are sufficient to explain this attenuation: multi-view averaging, whereby temporal integration of the same landmark sampled from different locations averages out position-dependent error, and multi-cue averaging, whereby concurrent weighting of multiple landmarks causes their parallax-induced biases to cancel each other out. Our results suggest that passive averaging, without active position-dependent correction, provides a simple and robust strategy for maintaining a stable allocentric reference frame, central to cognitive mapping. More broadly, these findings highlight a trade-off in neural coding between computational efficiency and positional accuracy, with implications for both biological and artificial navigation systems.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

We showed that HSN class motor neurons degenerate in early adult stage animals. Here, we expand on our past work by performing behavioral analyses to deduce the effect of APOE4 on the function of distinct neuronal circuits. We found evidence that APOE4 induces dysfunction of other neurons; this spatiotemporal pattern roughly correlates with endogenous levels of PTL-1, the C. elegans homolog of human MAPT also known as tau. Moreover, deletion of ptl-1 suppressed defects in multiple behaviors, suggesting broad protective effects across the nervous system including the HSN neurons. Lastly, we show that PTL-1 in the touch receptor neurons, where PTL-1 is most abundant, contributes non-cell autonomously for age-related axon dysmorphia and dysfunction of the HSN neurons.

I first show that the high diversity reported by Siljestam and Rueffler is so sensitive to parameter values that the underlying phenomenon cannot explain the widespread diversity of MHC genes. I then consider a fundamental problem with explaining MHC diversity by heterozygote advantage alone: selective forces that favored heterozygotes would lead to the evolution of haplotypes having much higher fitness when homozygous, diminishing or eliminating heterozygote advantage. Diversity maintained by another force, however, might bring about adaptation to the more common heterozygous state at the expense of homozygous fitness.

Whether such pathways can solubilize economically-critical cobalt remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that secondary metabolites produced by the model bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis subspecies aureofaciens associated with MIC of iron could corrode cobalt by oxidation (i.e., phenazines) or by acting as a ligand (i.e., cyanide). One-week incubations using live cells supplied with Co(0) wires led to 20-30% cobalt mass losses and ~2200 M Co(2+) recovered in solution, which was at least 3-fold higher than filtered cultures and sterile medium controls. Removing the capacity for cells to produce phenazines and cyanide showed similar corrosion compared to wild type cells and phenazine standards did not corrode cobalt, ruling these metabolites out as contributors to MIC. Further experiments testing whether metabolite mixtures devoid of phenazines could corrode Co(0) in the presence and absence of oxygen confirmed that atmospheric oxygen initiates Co(0) oxidation, and that unidentified cell-derived metabolites drive MIC forward by keeping Co(2+) from precipitating as oxides that form a passivation layer on the wire surface. This revised mechanistic explanation underscores the importance of considering how abiotic redox cycling and cellular metabolites that solubilize metals interact in the MIC of non-ferrous metals. Identifying the biosynthetic pathways involved in solubilizing cobalt will be key to reframing MIC as more than an environmental concern and optimizing sustainable cobalt recovery strategies for solid waste that rely on naturally-occurring microbial metabolites.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Relapsed AML remains largely unresponsive to current therapies and carries a poor prognosis. We developed a large-language model (LLM) agent that incorporates multi-modal data to nominate druggable therapeutic targets for AML. We identified that higher expression of AGTR2 (encoding AT2R) is associated with better chemotherapy response and longer survival. In functional studies of 68 primary human AML samples, we found that LSCs consistently lacked AT2R expression. Across both CD34-expressing and -non-expressing AML samples, AT2R expression positively correlated with CD34 and CD117 expression. In patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models using 21 primary AML samples, AT2R- cells initiated leukemia, whereas AT2R+ cells failed to do so. AT2R- cells gave rise to both AT2R+ and AT2R- progeny, suggesting hierarchical differentiation. Following chemotherapy in AML PDX mice, bone marrow analysis showed a marked enrichment of AT2R- cells and depletion of AT2R+ cells, indicating that AT2R- cells drive minimal residual disease and relapse. These results support the role of AT2R absence as a marker of LSCs. We observed reduced AT2R expression in AML cells compared to healthy peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Whole-genome sequencing of AML patients revealed no functional mutations in AGTR2. However, 3D chromatin and epigenetic analyses uncovered frequent chromatin rearrangements involving AGTR2 promoter-silencer interactions, indicating epigenetic silencing as a likely mechanism for AT2R downregulation in AML. To validate the tumor suppressor role of AT2R, we developed murine AML models driven by MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a fusions with either Agtr2 knockdown or enforced expression. Agtr2 knockdown accelerated leukemogenesis, while enforced Agtr2 expression delayed AML progression. In these models, enforced Agtr2 expression reduced LSC frequency, impaired cell cycle progression, and decreased AML stemness, as confirmed by limiting dilution assays and analysis of LSC-enriched populations. Mechanistically, enforced Agtr2 expression suppressed fatty acid metabolism - a key driver of AML stemness and growth - and inhibited downstream signaling pathways, including GSK3, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/b-catenin. This led to reduced SREBF1 activity, confirmed by protein level changes and CUT&Tag assays. We tested buloxibutid (C21), a small-molecule AT2R agonist currently in phase II trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in AML PDX models derived from 20 de novo and 6 relapsed AML samples. C21 significantly inhibited AML progression and enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy, particularly in relapsed AML models.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

However, current approaches predominantly rely on a narrow set of ubiquitously expressed E3 ligases, such as Cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel Lindau (VHL), which limits tissue specificity, increases systemic toxicity, and fosters resistance. Here, we present an AI-driven framework for the rational identification of tissue specific E3 ligases suitable for precision-targeted degradation. Our model leverages a BERT-based protein language architecture trained on billions of sequences to generate contextual embeddings that capture structural and functional motifs relevant for E3 substrate compatibility. By integrating these embeddings with tissue resolved protein protein interaction data, the framework predicts ligase/target interactions that are both biologically plausible and context restricted. This enables the prioritization of ligases capable of driving selective degradation of pathogenic proteins within disease-relevant tissues.

R.; Koslicki, D.; Martinez, C.", "abstract": "With the surge in sequencing data generated from an ever-expanding range of biological studies, designing scalable computational techniques has become essential. One effective strategy to enable large-scale computation is to split long DNA or protein sequences into k-mers, and summarize large k-mer sets into compact random samples (a.k.a. sketches). These random samples allow for rapid estimation of similarity metrics such as Jaccard or cosine, and thus facilitate scalable computations such as fast similarity search, classification, and clustering. Popular sketching tools in bioinformatics include Mash and sourmash. Mash uses the MinHash algorithm to generate fixed-size sketches; while sourmash employs FracMinHash, which produces sketches whose size scales linearly with the total number of k-mers.\n\nHere, we introduce a novel algorithm, MO_SCPLOWAXC_SCPLOWGO_SCPLOWEOMC_SCPLOWHO_SCPLOWASHC_SCPLOW, which for a specified parameter r > 1, will produce, without prior knowledge of n (the number of k-mers) a random sample of size r lg(n/r)+ [O] (r). Notably, this is the first deterministic, permutation-invariant, and parallelizable sketching algorithm to date that can produce sub-linear sketches. We also introduce a variant, -MO_SCPLOWAXC_SCPLOWGO_SCPLOWEOMC_SCPLOWHO_SCPLOWASHC_SCPLOW, that produces random samples of size{Theta} (n) for a given  [isin] (0, 1).

The most common method for computing motor modules is non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which identifies a matrix of motor modules and their corresponding time-series activity from electromyography data. NMF has several limitations, including dependence of the muscle weightings on the number of modules selected. Approaches for selecting the number of modules vary between studies, making it difficult to compare and reproduce results. Some metrics of motor control complexity use the variance accounted for when extracting a single motor module (VAF1), yet that modules structure offers little biomechanical interpretability. In this work, we present a method for computing motor modules using an autoencoder, a neural network architecture that can find latent representations of data. Using a single layer autoencoder, we extracted motor modules from data in able-bodied and individuals post-stroke. The structure of autoencoder-computed modules were significantly less sensitive to selected module number. With the autoencoder-computed modules, increasing the number of modules added new information, instead of splitting previous modules. Autoencoder-computed modules, especially at low module counts, had more distinct and interpretable biomechanical functions. Lastly, the autoencoder-computed modules are consistent with previous NMF studies in persons with stroke, which found fewer modules needed to explain the muscle activity of paretic limbs. Our autoencoder-based method offers a new approach for computing motor modules, with advantages of better stability in module structure across module counts, and a more biomechanically relevant interpretation of VAF1.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYThis work presents an approach for computing motor modules using an autoencoder and comprehensively compares the in stability of motor module structure, functional significance at low module counts, and interpretation of VAF1 to the current state of the art.

Engineered with surface-displayed nanobodies, SimCells and mini-SimCells selectively bind bacteria expressing specific antigens (e.g., OmpA in E. coli). The selective interactions facilitate close SimCell-pathogen proximity, enabling two antimicrobial mechanisms: direct injection of toxic effectors into bacterial cytoplasm via a heterologous expression of type VI secretion system (T6SS), and enzymatic conversion of aspirin into catechol by engineered salicylate hydroxylase, leading to sustained local production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Our results demonstrate that both reprogrammed SimCells and mini-SimCells can eliminate target E. coli with high specificity and efficiency. Multi-dose reprogrammed mini-SimCell treatment led to a 10^3-fold selective reduction of targeted bacteria in mixed microbial communities, with minimal disruption to non-target bacteria.

Astrocytic calcium events arise both spontaneously and in response to behaviour. In this study, we examined how these unitary events shape population-level calcium activity during quiescence and locomotion. Using two-photon imaging of astrocytic calcium in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake mice running on a freely rotating disk, we found that spontaneous fluctuations during quiescence were driven mainly by the co-occurrence of new calcium events rather than by their enlargement. During locomotion, population responses progressed through four phases: the emergence of new events, their merging into a superevent, fragmentation of this superevent, and an afterburst. New events appeared immediately at locomotion onset, indicating a rapid astrocytic response. The response also exhibited a temporal threshold of ~5 seconds: when locomotion was shorter than this, the superevent phase failed to develop, and the population response was markedly reduced. In suprathreshold responses, the superevent displayed a {Delta}F/F intensity pattern that reproduced reliably across locomotion episodes. Hotspots within this pattern had shorter latencies and were also more active during quiescence, suggesting that the response is at least partly deterministic. Consistent with this, we were able to reproduce both the response phases and the superevent pattern using a dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model driven by synthetic or real locomotion inputs.

Since rodent studies indicated that stress regulation relies on limbic and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) outputs, we aimed to investigate whether data from these regions could also predict cortisol and affect trajectories following psychosocial stress in humans. In this pre-registered study, 281 healthy adults (145 female) were exposed to ScanSTRESS. Repeated assessments of salivary cortisol and negative affect were used to identify response trajectories (i.e. groups of participants) using latent class mixture modelling (LCMM). LCMMs without brain predictors were compared to LCMMs including structural (volume, thickness) and functional (activation, exposure-time effect) predictors from the amygdala, hippocampus, or mPFC regions. Results showed that cortisol LCMMs without brain predictors exhibited a single mean trajectory. Adding brain predictors resulted in three to four response trajectories, depending on region and outcome. Within identified models, cortisol hyper-response trajectories were predicted by larger amygdala and hippocampus volumes. Cortisol non-responses were predicted by greater amygdala activation and volume. Elevated baseline cortisol was predicted by higher hippocampal activation. mPFC markers did not predict cortisol trajectories, however, medial orbitofrontal cortex parameters identified affect response profiles mirroring trait-like affect.

The leading hypothesis posits that tFUS exerts its neuromodulatory effects through direct activation of neurons, while others attribute effects to indirect activation of auditory pathways. Here, we investigated the neuromodulatory effects of tFUS on the dentato-thalamo-cortical (DTC) pathway by targeting either the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) or auditory cortex (AUD) in anesthetized rats. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from bilateral motor cortices and the contralateral auditory cortex revealed that tFUS reliably evoked cortical potentials, whereas sham stimulation produced no responses. Both LCN and AUD stimulation activated the auditory cortex, suggesting auditory pathway involvements. However, only LCN stimulation elicited early and significant event-related potentials and gamma-band activity in the contralateral motor cortex, consistent with DTC pathway engagement. We propose that LCN-targeted stimulation engages the DTC pathway through modulation of neuronal excitability, while concurrent auditory inputs account for global cortical activation. These results are consistent with a hybrid mechanism in which tFUS modulates neuronal dynamics, converging both direct and indirect components depending on the stimulation site. Proposed framework reconciles competing views of tFUS as either a direct or indirect modulator and clarifies how ultrasound can differentially influence cortical circuits depending on the stimulation target.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate how chronic fentanyl use (i.e., 20 days) influences the neuroimmune state, microglial activity, and amyloid burden in wildtype and APPPS1-21 mice, a transgenic model of AD. In wild-type mice, fentanyl use promoted a pro-inflammatory state without increasing the incidence of disease-associated microglia.

Our findings indicate that chronic fentanyl use fundamentally changes the trajectory of neuroimmune activity and features characteristic of early AD by enabling microglia to enhance A{beta} clearance.

A.", "abstract": "Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small, circular double-stranded DNA viruses that establish lifelong persistent infections. PyV infections are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause severe disease particularly in immunosuppressed individuals, including BKPyV-associated nephropathy, and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) caused by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). While most individuals are infected with PyVs during childhood, it is unclear how these viruses persist in the host and what cellular signals prompt their reactivation. The early regions of PyV genomes encode regulatory proteins that control viral replication and host cell transformation in the case of MCPyV, SV40 and murine polyomavirus (MuPyV). All PyV early regions encode Large and Small Tumor antigens (LT, ST), which are splice variants of a common transcript. PyV LTs bind and inhibit RB1 via a conserved LxCxE motif, deregulating E2F transcriptional activity and cell cycle control to promote viral replication and tumorigenesis. The existing paradigm in the field is during normal PyV infection, LT is expressed and drives the host cell into S phase. However, a recent study revealed that cells infected with BKPyV only express LT and replicate the viral genome when already in S phase, but the mechanisms activating LT expression during S phase are unknown. The Non-Coding Control Region (NCCR), found in all PyVs, contains the viral origin of replication and predicted transcription factor (TF) binding sites, yet only a handful have been experimentally validated and shown to regulate PyV early transcription. Here, we set out to identify host TFs that bind the MCPyV NCCR to regulate early transcription in both MCC cells and in an in vitro model of MCPyV infection. We identified E2F1-3 as critical regulators of MCPyV early transcription, which bind to the MCPyV NCCR via a consensus E2 site just upstream of LT/ST transcriptional start site. We discovered E2 sites in the NCCRs of several other polyomaviruses, including MuPyV but not BKPyV. Deletion of the E2 sites in PyV NCCRs downregulates early transcription in luciferase assays. Despite not containing a consensus E2 site, we detected weak E2F binding to the NCCRs of BKPyV and SV40, suggesting that E2Fs also contribute to transcription of their early genes. Overall, our findings challenge the existing paradigm of PyV infection, that LT expression activates E2F signaling via RB1 inhibition, and suggest that E2Fs must already be active in the PyV-infected host cell for LT/ST expression and viral replication.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

These effects are generally attributed to reduced hepatic lipogenesis and increased {beta}-oxidation; however, the contribution of white adipose tissue (WAT) towards the hypotriglyceridemic properties of N-3 PUFA is less defined. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) regulates TAG hydrolysis to influence fatty acid uptake into WAT, a process that can be inhibited by angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4). When re-examining a previous mouse study, we found that mice consuming a diet rich in EPA/DHA had increased WAT Angptl4 expression in the fasted state compared to a control diet. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore the role of N-3 PUFA on the regulation of Angptl4 expression and LPL activity in adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with DHA (100M), but not ALA or EPA, increased Angptl4 expression and reduced LPL activity similar to that observed with a PPAR{gamma} agonist (pioglitazone). When Ppar{gamma} expression was knocked down with siRNA, the ability of DHA and pioglitazone to induce Angptl4 expression was ablated. Further, DHA- and pioglitazone-induced reductions in LPL activity were mitigated when Angptl4 expression was silenced. Taken together, these results suggest that DHA regulates LPL activity by increasing Angptl4 expression in a PPAR{gamma}-dependent manner.

We used Cosinor regression to reanalyze four human skin time-series transcriptomic datasets (paired epidermis/dermis samples, N=11, N=19) and found that, using either absolute or relative amplitude measures, distributions of gene amplitudes tended to cluster by subject.

Based on this observation, we used the properties of concave functions to model how phenotypic differences and inheritance vary across increasingly integrated levels of organization. We show that the more integrated the phenotypic levels, the closer the phenotypic values and the larger the positive deviation from additivity (i.e. dominance or heterosis). These results may explain various observations such as the low heritability and high inbreeding depression of fitness components, and the phenotypic buffering of molecular polymorphisms. Furthermore, the introduction of a cost/crowding factor in the model may explain why overdominance is so rare while heterosis is so common. To our knowledge, this systems biology approach to the genotype-phenotype relationship is the first to be based on a theoretical model of the propagation of genetic variation across phenotypic levels.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Increasing evidence points to epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, as regulators of these processes, yet their role in long-lived trees across seasons and generations remains poorly understood. We generated single-base resolution maps of cytosine methylation exploring the epigenetic landscape of 180 year-old mature oak (Quercus robur) trees (genetically homogeneous) along spring, summer and autumn, and in their progeny. Genome-wide DNA-methylation revealed a progressive increase in the CHH context (H = A, T or C) from Spring to Summer and Autumn, suggesting epigenetic reprogramming is happening over season. Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) were concentrated in promoter regions and terminal inverted repeat (TIR). Differentially methylated transposable elements (TEs) and genes were involved in leaf development and hormonal signalling. By contrast, generational differences (parents versus offspring) were most prominent in CG and CHG contexts and were concentrated in genic regions. Oaks exhibit distinct seasonal and generational DNA methylation signatures, highlighting the plasticity and developmental specificity of epigenetic regulation. These findings provide a genomic foundation for understanding how epigenetic memory contributes to phenology, developmental programming and long-term adaptation in long-lived plants.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

P.; Elston, S. P.; Royer, C. M.; Ji, H.", "abstract": "Exposure to wildfire smoke is a significant public health concern with the respiratory system heavily impacted. Wildfire events are increasing in number and severity, and inhalation of wildfire smoke can lead to airway inflammation, oxidative stress-induced lung injury, impaired mucociliary clearance, and exacerbation of respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Despite these well-documented health risks, the molecular mechanisms underlying the respiratory effects of wildfire smoke exposure and recovery remain incompletely understood. In this study, we utilized transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to investigate how exposure to wood smoke (WS) influences the expression patterns of gene networks in differentiated tracheobronchial epithelial cells. Our analysis identified exposure-induced differentially methylated regions, differentially expressed genes and gene networks that are implicated in lung disease, including dysregulation of immune responses, oxidative stress and cell death, compromise of epithelial barrier integrity and function, and epigenetic remodeling. Strikingly, significant transcriptomic changes were still detected one week after exposure cessation, enriched in pathways involved in inflammation, wound healing and tissue repair. Despite these transcriptomic and epigenomic perturbations, histology staining revealed no significant changes in epithelial tissue morphology following WS exposure. However, we found a significant number of pulmonary disease-associated genes and pathways whose transcription were affected by WS exposure. Our study enhances understanding of the molecular basis of wildfire smoke-induced respiratory effects and highlights the potential for WS to leave a lasting imprint on airway epithelium, with important implications for respiratory health in exposed populations.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Here we systematically explored complementary strategies to bypass this initiation block across editable and hard-to-edit human cell types. In Expi293F suspension cells, precise genome editing of EIF2S1 to block Ser52 phosphorylation (eIF2-S52A) produced high-activity extracts. Genetic knockout of EIF2AK2 (PKR)-the principal eIF2 kinase engaged in eIF2 phosphorylation in Expi293F lysates-also improved translation, further establishing eIF2 phosphorylation as the dominant bottleneck in Expi293F translation extracts. Because genome editing is impractical in many contexts including primary human cells, we also implemented expression-based rescue of eIF2 phosphorylation: stable piggyBac integration of truncated GADD34 (PPP1R15A) and K3L, a viral eIF2 decoy, under control of a Tet-inducible promotor in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and primary human fibroblasts. After differentiating engineered KOLF2.1J iPSCs into cardiomyocytes, we found that stable GADD34/K3L expression increased translation output in cardiomyocyte translation extracts. Using the piggyBac expression system in primary fibroblasts also resulted in improved translational output. Together these data pinpoint eIF2 phosphorylation as the key barrier to robust translation in human cell translation extracts. They also show that editing eIF2 or removing PKR is optimal where genome editing is feasible, while providing a portable GADD34/K3L expression cassette enables production of translationally active lysates from systems where genome editing is challenging or not possible.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

During m7G cap formation in mammals, nascent transcripts receive a guanosine cap which is methylated by RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT). Unlike other capping enzymes which interact directly with RNA pol II, RNMT is recruited to the guanosine cap by interactions with RNA and the cap itself. RNMT is regulated during cell differentiation with significant impact on which RNAs are expressed and translated. The gene-specificity of RNMT was unexplained since RNMT in complex with activating subunit, RAM, binds to RNA without sequence preference. Through the development of improved RNA-protein detection, CLIP-ART, we report that RNMT interacts directly with RNA G4 quadraplexes (rG4). RNMT predominantly interacts with rG4s in the 5' UTR (untranslated regions) of mRNAs, indicating a mechanism for anchoring RNMT adjacent to the guanosine cap substrate. RNMT interacts with rG4s in transcripts which encode proteins involved in growth and proliferation. The RNMT-rG4 interaction is specific to the RNMT monomer, rather than RNMT-RAM, indicating a mechanism by which differential regulation of RNMT and RAM, can lead to cap methylation of specific RNAs involved in growth control.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

However, current methods for their preparation often lack specificity, resulting in heterogeneous products. Here, we present a novel strategy to covalently label the Fc domain of antibodies with single-strand DNA in a site-specific and stoichiometrically controlled manner. This method employs unmodified oligonucleotides and a fusion protein consisting of a protein G dimer linked to an HUH endonuclease. We first evaluated the sequence specificity and optimal conditions for DNA attachment to three HUH endonuclease variants, DCV, PCV2, and WDV. Our results show increased sequence specificity in the presence of Mg2+ compared to the more commonly used Mn2+ cofactor ion. Although formation of the phospho-tyrosine bond is found to be reversible, no significant hydrolysis of the protein-DNA conjugates is observed for up to 8 days at room temperature. The DCV domain allowed essentially complete formation of DNA-fusion protein conjugates at a 1:1 protein-DNA ratio, eliminating the need for removal of excess oligos. Subsequent photo-crosslinking yielded antibody-DNA conjugates that were successfully used in a proximity extension assay (PEA) to detect TNF and IL-6.

To replicate these conditions, we examined sperm scattering and migratory behavior in microfabricated obstacle lattices with varying spacing. We found a passive adaptive sensing mechanism that regulates sperm surface interactions in confined and curved environments. Specifically, scattering dynamics, including the collision angle, were impacted as sperm navigated the lattice, and surface interaction times were reduced under more confined conditions. A mathematical model was developed to describe sperm transport in these structured landscapes, predicting up to a nine-fold enhancement of diffusivity compared to free swimming sperm. Hyperactivated sperm displayed similar adaptive behavior within the lattice. We found that sperm dynamically adjust their navigation strategy in response to environmental geometry, allowing efficient migration despite confinement. More broadly, the study highlights how physical structure modulates microswimmer behavior and provides new insight into the physical processes that govern sperm navigation and the mechanisms underlying mammalian fertilization.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Q.", "abstract": "Actin is a conserved cytoskeletal protein essential for processes such as morphogenesis, motility, and division. Its versatility stems from filament assembly and regulation by actin-binding proteins (ABPs). Among these, alpha-actinin organizes actin filaments into bipolar bundles or unipolar networks, while cofilin preferentially binds to ADP-actin regions, clustering and shortening the half helical pitch (HHP). How alpha-actinin alters or stabilizes filament and protomer conformations and affects cofilin binding remains unsolved. Using high-speed AFM, all-atom MD simulations, and principal component analysis (PCA), we show that alpha-actinin stabilizes actin filaments in the canonical helical state more effectively than bare filaments, thereby preventing cofilin-induced helical shortening required for cooperative binding and clustering. Our results further reveal stabilized local fluctuations without significant changes in protomer spacing or subdomain geometry, maintaining a flattened protomer conformation that restricts the twisting necessary for cofilin cooperativity. We decipher that cofilin binding and clustering proceed through initial attachment to shortened ADP-bound HHP, followed by protomer twisting and further HHP shortening with fewer protomers, leading to enhanced cooperative binding. Conversely, the absence of these steps inhibits cooperative binding. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized atomic mechanism by which alpha-actinin modulates actin filament dynamics and structure-dependent interactions with other ABPs essential for spatiotemporal cytoskeletal organization.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

M.; Takeshita, S. S.; Foley, S. L.; Johnson, M.

Protein-based biochemical oscillators have particular applications in synthetic biology because they can access fast and slow timescales that are independent from the transcription-translation machinery required of genetic oscillators. Here, we introduce and model such a mass-conserving biochemical oscillator using mass-action reaction kinetics that exploits dynamic changes to membrane phospholipid concentrations to drive proteins on and off the membrane in robust, tunable rhythms. Importantly, the oscillations rely on amplification of reactions on the membrane via dimensional reduction, and they are therefore tunable by variations in the volume-to-surface area ratio (V/A) of the system. With components inspired by the endocytic machinery, we show that a wide range of physiologically relevant biochemical rates can produce oscillations in part due to this independent geometric control. A broad computational screen of the high-dimensional parameter space reveals that oscillations require relatively strict enzyme kinetic design rules for low V/A but much more permissive kinetics for larger V/A. We validate that oscillations persist with more realistic reaction-diffusion simulations that captures explicit diffusion and stochastic, integer valued copy numbers, in overall good agreement with the period and amplitude of the deterministic oscillators. Because the oscillations rely on time-dependent changes to the surface properties and not post-translational modifications to the protein subunits, we demonstrate that it can be coupled to a self-assembling trimer, driving not only changes in localization but trimer yield. Our analysis establishes this membrane-localization oscillator as a new, geometry tunable and programmable timing module and suggests a potential for geometry sensing in engineered or cell-free systems.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

To examine this, we conducted cardiac phase-targeting rapid cryofixation of Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. We adjusted the timepoint of cryogen exposure to the electrically paced heart and observed phase-dependent differences in the sarcomere length (SL) of subepicardial myocytes by -actinin immunohistochemistry, namely a significantly shorter SL during systole than during diastole. We detected spatially inhomogeneous SL distributions by generating a heatmap of the myocardium. For peak systole the SL heatmap exhibited nearly uniform SL shortening within and among the individual myocytes with some myocardia exhibiting nonuniform SLs. During diastole, the heart showed predominant SL elongation, which was also accompanied by patchy distributions of locally short-SL regions, reflecting inhomogeneous SLs. This SL inhomogeneity was attenuated by pharmacological relaxation by 2,3-butanedione monoxime. The heatmap of the rapidly-frozen heart during ventricular fibrillation also revealed inhomogeneous SLs within and among individual myocytes. Overall, cardiac phase-targeting cryofixation unveiled in-depth behaviors on SL in the heart.

The Cancer Dependency Map Project (DepMap) aimed to characterize the landscape of single-gene dependencies, which increased the universe of potential drug targets. However, the common challenges of drug off target effects and polypharmacology may limit effectiveness of single genes as drug targets. To address this limitation, we apply BioBombe, an AI/ML framework, to DepMap gene dependency data. This approach characterizes gene process dependencies, which are groups of genes within a biological process that cells rely on for survival. BioBombe fits many hundreds of dimensionality reduction models, across a range of latent dimensionalities. We find that this multiple-model approach discovers many more gene process dependencies than any single model alone. Using Reactome and CORUM-based gene set enrichment analyses, we characterize the landscape of the gene process dependencies, identifying, for example, mitotic regulation or the citric acid cycle as targets, as well as many cancer type-specific dependencies. In gliomas, TP53- and mitochondrial-related pathways emerged as key process vulnerabilities. Linking gene process dependencies with drug sensitivity scores on matched cell lines, we discovered both established and novel candidates.

The limited progress in developing more effective therapies is, in part, attributable to the vast desmoplastic stroma present in PC. Additionally, immunosuppressive steroid-signalling has recently been shown to aid the development and metastasis of various tumour types. Therefore, we sought to explore whether local steroidogenesis and steroid signalling within the tumour microenvironment (TME) play a role in pancreatic cancer development. Reanalysis of publicly available datasets, including single cell RNA sequencing, as well as in vivo metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mouse models, allowed us to identify Hsd11b1 as the key enzyme responsible for locally elevated levels of the immunosuppressive glucocorticoid hormone, corticosterone. We identified fibroblasts as the major Hsd11b1-expressing populations in the pancreatic TME. Specifically, in mice, Hsd11b1 expression is primarily observed in iCAFs. Additionally, we found that patients with higher HSD11B1 expression present an increased mortality rate as well as an enriched fibrotic signature and inhibited immune activity. Collectively, these findings suggest that Hsd11b1 upregulation in iCAFs could be aiding PDAC development by promoting the activation of glucocorticoids directly in the TME. The presence of glucocorticoids inhibits inflammation and could also be enhancing local fibrosis by autocrine signalling in the fibroblast population. Given the urgent need for effective treatments in this fatal disease, targeting HSD11B1 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome the immunosuppressive desmoplastic barrier and improve patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Vitis vinifera cultivars, responsible for most wine and table grape production, are particularly sensitive to water deficit, whereas many rootstocks derive from different Vitis species or interspecific hybrids with higher stress tolerance. A key step toward mitigating the effects of severe drought is the identification of regulatory genes controlling drought responses, enabling the design of gene expression based strategies or the generation of resilient cultivars through new breeding technologies. In this study, we performed a meta-transcriptomic analysis to identify genes consistently differentially expressed under drought in cultivated V. vinifera and two hybrid rootstocks (M4 and 101-14). Using more than twenty drought-control comparisons, we identified a core set of 4,617 drought-responsive genes that were consistently mis regulated across multiple experimental conditions. This core gene set was used to construct gene regulatory networks integrating genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding motif analysis with random forest-based regulatory network generation employing machine learning techniques. We identified key TFs, including the Abscisic-Acid-(ABA) Responsive Element Binding Factor 2 (ABF2), MYB30A and an uncharacterized HMGbox domain protein, as central regulators within the network. Several top-ranking TFs, displaying up- or down-regulation under drought conditions, were primarily identified as positive regulators of their target genes, while lower-hierarchy TFs exhibited inverse expression relationships with their predicted targets. The network exhibited a hierarchical organization architecture among several TFs whose homologues in other species are linked to ABA signaling, with several TF families represented, each potentially operating at distinct regulatory tiers. Some TFs appear to act as central hubs orchestrating broad transcriptional programs, whereas others likely control more specialized branches of the drought response.

Utilising these data, together with new computational tools, we extract and analyse the dendrites of all T4 and T5 neurons within one hemisphere (n [~] 6000). T4 and T5 neurons are the first uniquely direction-selective neurons in the visual pathway, and are classified into four subtypes (a,b,c, and d). Each subtype encodes one of four cardinal motion directions (up, down, forwards, backwards). The dendrites of these neurons form in two distinct neuropils, the Medulla (T4) and the Lobula (T5), and are asymmetrically oriented in a direction inverse to the direction of motion which they encode. However, their densely overlapping and compact arbours has made rigorous morphological quantification challenging. The presence of differences beyond their characteristic orientation, both between T4 and T5, as well as within subtypes, has remained poorly understood. Our analysis reveals a high degree of structural similarity across both types and subtypes. Particularly, measures of geometry and graph topology show only minor variation, with no consistent separation between T4 and T5, or their subtypes. These results indicate that, despite forming in different neuropils, and serving distinct motion directions, T4 and T5 dendrites follow closely aligned morphological patterns.

Using multimodal MRI data from 72 BD patients and 65 matched healthy controls, we observed a global increase of MFC of BD, which indicates a desimilarity of brain microstructure and function. Partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis revealed that the principal latent component linking MFC to behavioral scores explained 67.2% of the variance, with the strongest contributions from the control and somatosensory networks. Mediation analysis demonstrated that regional MFC influenced anxiety indirectly through depressive symptoms, supporting a sequential affective transition from depression to anxiety. Moreover, macroscale gradient analysis showed that the principal MFC gradient was significantly correlated with neurotransmitter receptor distributions, including A4B2, 5 HT1B, and H3.

GSK4716 also prevented alcohol-conditioned place preference without affecting saccharin intake or mouse locomotion. Similarly, in rats, GSK4716 reduced operant oral alcohol self-administration in non-dependent and dependent (by CIE) rats under fixed and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement. Overall, these results support the efficacy of transcriptome-wide gene regulatory network approaches for the identification of key druggable regulators of long-term transcriptional adaptations that sustain the molecular and behavioral pathology of alcohol dependence and identify ERR{gamma} as a regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and seeking, and a therapeutic target for AUD.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

However, a critical methodological challenge lies in the variability of dFC estimates across different dFC assessment methods, raising concerns about the reliability and interpretation of downstream findings. While deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated the ability to capture traditionally inaccessible data patterns in many disciplines, they encounter challenges when applied to neuroimaging data. For instance, the high dimensionality, noise, and temporal complexity inherent in dFC makes it challenging for DL models to extract meaningful and interpretable insights. In this study, we investigated how DL architectures can be developed and adapted to predict task presence over time from task-based dFC data, and additionally, how the choice of dFC assessment method influences the predictive performance of DL models. We developed and compared a convolutional neural network (CNN), a node-level classification graph convolutional network (GCN), and a graph-level classification GCN based on their ability to predict time points at which subjects were performing a cognitive task or at rest. In our study, the results indicate that both DL model architecture and dFC estimation methodology significantly impact task presence prediction capacity, while the specific task paradigm had minimal influence out of the limited types that were explored. This work offers a powerful benchmark for understanding the dynamics of underlying task-driven cognitive state transitions and the analytical flexibility limitations of dFC estimation methods and DL architectures.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

We also used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to visualize the evolving patterns of neural activity. Two main findings emerged. First, numerosity exhibited the hallmarks of a primary perceptual attribute: its neural signature appeared rapidly after stimulus onset, preceding the encoding of non-numeric features that could otherwise define number. Second, Visualization of the neural patterns using MDS suggested a temporal transformation in representational geometry, reflecting the engagement of two distinct coding schemes- an early, linear number line, consistent with a \"summation code\", dominating activity in occipital regions, and a later, curved number line, consistent with \"numerosity-tuned code\", emerging more strongly in associative areas along the dorsal stream. Together, these findings demonstrate that numerosity processing is encoded directly from the visual image and unfolds through a rapid hierarchical transformation, from a broad quantity signal to a finely tuned, number-specific code, linking perceptual encoding to higher-level numerical abstraction.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

While the glutamate/glycine-activated GluN2-containing NMDA receptors (GluN1/GluN2) have been extensively studied, the physiological roles and pharmacology of glycine-activated GluN3-containing receptors (GluN1/GluN3) remain less understood. Although GluN1/GluN3 receptors exhibit unique functional properties and play distinct roles in neuronal development and synapse maturation, studies of their precise roles in neurophysiology and circuit function are impeded by limited availability of GluN3-selective pharmacological tools. This study describes UCM-A86, a novel GluN3-selective positive allosteric modulator, with EC50 values of 21 M and 19 M at GluN1/GluN3A and GluN1/GluN3B receptors, respectively. UCM-A86 selectively potentiates recombinant GluN1/GluN3A and GluN1/GluN3B receptors by 436% and 174%, respectively, relative to activation by glycine, with no activity at recombinant GluN1/GluN2A-D receptors. Furthermore, UCM-A86 selectively potentiates responses from native GluN1/GluN3A receptors expressed in somatostatin-expressing interneurons of the somatosensory cortex with no modulation of hippocampal AMPA receptor- and GluN1/2 NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Mechanistic studies suggest that UCM-A86 modulation is facilitated by agonist binding (or channel gating) and that UCM-A86 primarily potentiates GluN1/GluN3A by increasing open probability with no effects on mean channel conductance. These findings advance the synthetic pharmacology of GluN1/GluN3 receptors and provide a novel tool for modulation of native GluN3-containing NMDA receptors.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Tuning of excitability in the corticospinal tract is central to many cognitive and motor processes, but little is known about how the LC contributes to this tuning. In particular, no existing studies have examined the effect of tVNS on corticospinal excitability 'online' during active stimulation, where the largest effects on pupil size are observed. Method: To address this question, we delivered repeated 4-second trains of tVNS and sham stimulation and elicited MEPs during stimulation trains (online) and shortly after train offset (offline). Pupil size was concurrently recorded throughout each train. Results: We discovered that tVNS significantly increases corticospinal excitability compared to sham stimulation, but only when measured online and not offline. The excitatory effects on corticospinal excitability were greater in the latter half of tVNS trains. Pupil size was also significantly increased by tVNS compared to sham; however, the effect on pupil size peaked earlier during the tVNS trains compared to corticospinal excitability. In line with these distinct temporal profiles, changes in corticospinal excitability and pupil size were not significantly correlated, likely reflecting differences in the anatomical circuits underpinning each effect. Conclusions: This work demonstrates for the first time that tVNS increases corticospinal excitability at rest, but the effect only emerges when corticospinal excitability is measured online during active tVNS.

We introduced premature termination codons (PTCs) at 15 different positions within the coding region of a GFP reporter gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Mutations located in the first third of the coding region typically led to decreased mRNA levels, whilst those occurring further downstream caused either no change or only minor reductions, consistent with current splicing-independent NMD models. However, PTCs located closer to the normal stop codon unexpectedly resulted in increased mRNA levels compared to the PTC-less control transcript. Analysis of intron-containing versions of these constructs confirmed that splicing enhances the impact of a nonsense mutation on mRNA levels. As expected, deletion of UPF1 in wild-type cells increased the levels of transcripts normally reduced by NMD. Interestingly, it also further increased the levels of transcripts that were already elevated compared to the PTC-less control in the wild-type background. The greater abundance of these mRNAs does not appear to be due to increased mRNA stability. Notably, a PTC located near the end of the coding sequence not only resulted in increased mRNA levels, but also in the production of a truncated, yet functional, GFP protein.

ERK supports protrusion of a leading edge and also activates the small GTPase Rho, which induces actin assembly into contractile stress fibers that pull the cell body forward. Yet, the mechanism behind ERK's induction of Rho in the cell body has remained elusive. We discover here that ERK controls Rho activity and contractile stress fibers by inhibiting Ezrin, a protein that physically links proximal actin filaments to the plasma membrane, but which also inhibits Rho by recruiting and activating ARHGAP18. ERK specifically reduces Ezrin activity in the cell body by phosphorylating the C-terminal tail of the Ezrin-activating kinase lymphocyte-oriented kinase (LOK). This phosphorylation inhibits LOK's activation of Ezrin, thereby releases Ezrin's inhibition of Rho and stress fibers.

The resulting Rivers are depleted of glycolytic enzymes but enriched in T cell derived stemness factors, enabling targeted rejuvenation of senescent tissues across multiple organs. In aged mice, adoptive transfer of young or metabolically reprogrammed CD4+ T cells triggered River production in vivo, and Rivers isolated from these animals could be transplanted into other aged mice to propagate the rejuvenation phenotype independently of T cells.

The dual origin of the trigeminal ganglion leads to a heterogenous neuronal population that transmits somatosensory information from the face back to the brain. Proper trigeminal ganglion development relies, in part, on neurotrophic signaling, including interactions between Nerve Growth Factor and its cognate receptor, Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), a receptor tyrosine kinase. Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, play a crucial role in the ability of TrkA to reach the plasma membrane, yet the specific glycan profile and functional relevance of these modifications have not been characterized in sensory neurons in vivo. Here, we sought to characterize the different glycosylation events occurring on TrkA during trigeminal ganglion neurodevelopment. We discovered that multiple glycoforms of TrkA exist that correlate to partially and fully mature versions of the protein reported in vitro. Furthermore, we discovered that TrkA interacts with a cell adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, on membranes of trigeminal neurons, both in the cell bodies and axons. Based on the size of the TrkA bands that interact with N-cadherin, our results suggest these interactions are occurring both on the plasma membrane and intracellularly on the membrane of organelles. While interactions between receptor tyrosine kinases and cadherins have been shown in other contexts, our findings are the first to identify such an interaction in the trigeminal ganglion and suggest an important role for coordination between neurotrophic signaling and cell adhesion for proper neurodevelopment, both during TrkA protein maturation and during receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.

Here, we show that the poorly characterized putative protease inhibitor gene, mlt-11, is directly regulated by the NHR-23 transcription factor. We identify key cis-regulatory elements required for robust mlt-11 expression. An internal MLT-11::mNeonGreen translational fusion transiently localized to the aECM in the cuticle and embryo. MLT-11::mNeonGreen was also detected in lining openings to the exterior (vulva, rectum, mouth). mlt-11 is necessary to pattern all layers of the adult cuticle, and reduction of MLT-11 levels disrupted the barrier function of the cuticle. Deletion of conserved Kunitz protease inhibitor domains or intervening sequences produced a range of defects including either left or right rollers, and small separations of the cuticle along the length of the animal (microblisters). MLT-11 is processed into at least two fragments and internal and C-terminal mNeonGreen knock-ins display distinct localization patterns. Predicted mlt-11 null mutations caused fully penetrant embryonic lethality and elongation defects.

While UCEs have been widely used in phylogenetic studies to reconstruct evolutionary relationships, their use in population-level research has been limited. This limited application stems from uncertainty over whether UCEs can capture the levels of genetic variation needed to answer population genomic questions central to ecology and biodiversity research. The concern is that, by definition, UCEs are highly conserved and may therefore lack sufficient within-species variation. The more variable flanking regions (400 to 750 bp from the UCE core) contain informative polymorphisms, though diversity decreases near the core. Thus, any naive estimator of genetic diversity that ignores this conservation will have an underestimation bias. In this paper, we introduce SPrUCE: Sigmoid Pi requiring UCEs, a reference-free method that estimates nucleotide diversity from aligned UCE data. SPrUCE corrects underestimation bias by modeling the change in diversity away from the UCE core using a Gompertz function. The model accounts for the bias introduced by the conserved core and allows for more accurate per-site diversity estimates. We tested SPrUCE on UCE alignments from a range of taxa, including invertebrates and vertebrates (finches, honeybees, sheep, and smelt). SPrUCE produces diversity values consistent with whole genome derived estimates that require an assembled reference. It is fast, scalable, and effective even with missing data.

We found, using in-vitro stopped-flow kinetic and equilibrium binding experiments, that the full-length protein has high dimerization affinity and dimerizes before binding DNA, as recently shown for the standalone CREB bZIP domain. CREB contains three recognised intrinsically disordered activation domains, which fall into classical acidic and glutamine-rich classifications. We show that all three contribute to decrease general affinity for DNA. This, in turn, makes the target-search process more efficient by limiting CREB sequestration on non-target DNA.

However, the underling mechanism of how ODC is recognized and processed without the ubiquitin tag by the 26S proteasome remain unclear. Here, we present eleven cryo-EM structures of the human 26S proteasome in complex with C-terminal truncated or full-length ODC, capturing the entire degradation process from initial recognition to final unfolding. These structures reveal a dynamic, multivalent recognition process involving sequential engagement with vWA domain of Rpn10, Rpt4/5 coiled-coil, and Rpn2 PC domain, collectively bypassing the need for ubiquitin. Although the folded ODC core is sufficient for initial binding, its flexible C-terminal tail is crucial for allosterically activating the proteasome AAA+ ATPase motor. Furthermore, we also identify a unique translocation gateway where Rpn11 JAMM motif guides the ODC C-tail into the AAA+ATPase ring, repurposing this deubiquitinase for a novel function. Once activated, the proteasome translocates ODC C-tail and unfolds ODC using its canonical ATP-driven machinery.

In humans, unilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) occur sporadically (VSspo), or bilaterally with neurofibromatosis type 2 syndrome (NF2) - VSnf2. VS formation is driven by sub-haploid NF2 gene dosage, typically by biallelic loss. Loss of merlin promotes hippo/TEAD dependent transcriptional reprogramming, proliferation, and paracrine signaling that varies across time, and tumor volume. These variations lead to a clinically unpredictable course, and incomplete response to treatment. We hypothesized that Schwann cell merlin inactivation state determines cell-wise hippo/TEAD dependency and drives schwannoma pathogenesis. We analyzed clinical samples from VSspo and VSnf2 with a multi-omics approach and detected variation in merlin activity within tumor Schwann cell population. We found that tumor-driving merlin-depleted Schwann cells (Schwannmer-) exhibited elevated hippo activity that was predominantly driven by TEAD1. In-silico TEAD1 perturbation led to a reversal to merlin intact Schwann phenotype. These findings, and tumor cell growth suppression were confirmed in NF2fl/fl;Peri-Cre mouse model, and in human-derived schwannoma cells treated with a pan-TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibitor VT3989.

Existing systems such as genetically engineered mouse models, xenografts, and patient-derived organoids have each advanced mechanistic insight but are limited by genetic scope, scalability, or lack of immune context. To overcome these constraints we developed ProMPt, a genetically-defined syngeneic mouse modelling platform that captures combinations of the most recurrent clinical prostate cancer genomic alterations to enable scalable in vitro and in vivo interrogation of prostate cancer evolution. Tumours derived from ProMPt organoids recapitulate the histologic and molecular diversity of human disease. Cross-species transcriptomic integration and multivariate single-cell analysis under defined culture permutations revealed conserved phenoscapes, highlighting a central role for MYC in disease progression and therapy resistance. Guided by these insights, preclinical intervention studies demonstrated that combined MAPK inhibition and blockade of protein translation synergistically suppressed tumour growth in castration-resistant models. This combination not only suppressed proliferation but also remodelled the tumour immune landscape, underscoring its dual epithelial and microenvironmental effects. Together, these findings establish ProMPt as a versatile framework for linking genotype, lineage plasticity, and therapeutic vulnerability in prostate cancer.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Adipocytes have emerged as key immune metabolic regulators that influence intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the role of IL-22RA1 signaling in adipocytes has not been explored. In the present study, we examined the role of IL22RA1 signaling in adipocytes in response to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mediated gut inflammation. To do this, we subjected adipocyte specific Il22ra1 knockout mice (Il22ra1Adipo) to intestinal inflammation under normal chow and HFD conditions. Compared to littermate controls, Il22ra1Adipo mice displayed significant weight loss on day 9 of DSS treatment and showed altered expression of immune response and lipid metabolism related genes in white adipose tissue (WAT) under a normal chow diet. Notably, when mice were primed with HFD prior to DSS induced intestinal injury, WAT from Il22ra1Adipo mice showed a significant reduction in Fabp4 expression and a marked increase in the proliferation marker Ki67. These findings indicate that loss of IL22RA1 signaling in adipocytes disrupts adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, leading to increased proliferation of preadipocytes or stromal cells without proper maturation. Importantly, this altered adipose tissue response occurred despite similar levels of colonic inflammation between knockout and control mice, suggesting a critical role for adipocyte IL22RA1 signaling in maintaining metabolic and inflammatory homeostasis in WAT during combined metabolic and intestinal inflammatory stress.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

However, recent work has revealed that temporary noise-induced threshold shifts may be associated with long-lasting cochlear histopathology. One such effect is cochlear synaptopathy, i.e. changes to the afferent synapse between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. Noise-induced synaptopathy has been extensively characterized in several rodent models, and temporal bone studies suggest similar age-related changes in humans. However, it remains unclear how noise-induced temporary threshold shifts affect cochlear structures in humans and nonhuman primates, which show greater resistance to noise exposure than other animals. Additionally, the long-term sequelae of temporary threshold shifts are largely unknown. Here, we characterized the effects of a noise exposure causing temporary hearing loss on cochlear histopathology in macaque monkeys at long post-exposure survival times. Overall, cochlear histopathology was variable across subjects, similar to the variable susceptibility observed in humans. At 2 and 10 months post-exposure, macaques had no significant loss of hair cells, inner hair cell synapses, or cholinergic efferent innervation. However, enlargement of ribbons in both inner and outer hair cells was observed. Together, these findings provide insight into the cochlear effects of single-exposure temporary threshold shifts in nonhuman primates.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

In the Xenopus laevis tadpole, we describe secondary vestibular neurons of inhibitory nature, and the synaptic contacts they make on VS neurons. Then, using a brainstem/spinal cord in vitro preparation we show that the spinal responses evoked by galvanic vestibular stimulation are shaped by both commissural and local inhibitory brainstem networks.

Aging is also associated with increased interindividual variability in behavioural and structural markers, and some studies report stronger brain-behaviour associations in older compared to younger adults. However, evidence for this remains mixed, and it is unclear whether young adults express similar relationships under comparable task demands. We tested whether bimanual performance is related differently to structural brain properties in younger and older adults. Twenty-three younger (22-27 years) and twenty-three older adults (65-70 years) performed a visually guided bimanual pinch-force task and underwent whole-brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and cortical thickness (CTh) were extracted from a pre-defined bilateral visuo-motor network and compared between groups. In regions showing significant age-related differences, we tested whether and how FA and CTh values correlates with bimanual performance within each age group. Older adults showed lower FA in the anterior portions of the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) III and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and lower CTh across most visuomotor regions, along with lower bimanual performance compared to young adults. Structure-function analyses in these areas revealed that bimanual performance correlated positively with FA in the anterior segment of the right SLF III in younger but not older adults. Furthermore, larger hemispheric asymmetries in cortical thickness between the dominant and non-dominant SMA correlated positively with larger intermanual performance differences between the dominant and non-dominant hand in younger but not older adults. These findings suggest that intrahemispheric white-matter integrity and interhemispheric cortical balance support efficient bimanual control in early adulthood, but they provide no evidence that structure-function relationships increase with age.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

SOAE is commonly characterized by peaks in a spectral domain representation (as derived from a discrete Fourier transform), occurring at idiosyncratic frequencies unique to a given ear. Such is typically computed as an averaged magnitude spectrum that discards phase information. Here, we explore the hypothesis that SOAE phase, readily extracted from pre-existing recordings, contains complementary information. We propose several measures to use this information to quantify otocoherence (a form of autocoherence referring to a phenomenon of the ear), primarily by measuring the consistency in SOAE phase accumulation over a particular timescale. We present results based on recordings from different species with disparate inner ear morphologies (humans, barn owls, lizards). For regions of SOAE activity we extract time constants representing the timescale over which otocoherence is maintained. We demonstrate that these vary significantly across species and (for the barn owl and Tokay gecko where this data is available) appear to correlate with measures of auditory nerve fiber tuning. Additionally, we adapted the method to identify regions of weak SOAE activity among fluctuations in the noise floor. These methods can readily be employed to re-analyze SOAE waveforms previously collected from a variety of species, making them of broader comparative utility to reveal information about SOAE generation and thereby active cochlear mechanics.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

However, the precise role of the locus coeruleus in the early stages of the disease remains unclear. To address this, we developed and characterized a novel mouse model based on the PRSx8-driven overexpression of human alpha-synuclein in noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus using an adeno-associated viral vector. Animals were assessed at 1 and 3 months post-injection using an integrated battery of histological, behavioural, neurochemical, and electrophysiological analyses. We observed robust accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the locus coeruleus, along with widespread propagation to projection areas, including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and dorsal raphe. Despite the absence of neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus, we identified reduced noradrenergic axonal integrity and marked decreases in both noradrenaline and serotonin levels, highlighting a disruption of neurochemical balance at an early stage. The electrophysiological data revealed transient alterations in the excitability and intrinsic properties of locus coeruleus neurons in a sex-dependent manner, suggesting that alpha-synuclein pathology induces early functional disruption prior to overt neurodegeneration. Behavioural outcomes demonstrated selective cognitive deficits and mild anxiety-like behaviours, while other non-motor functions remained preserved. Importantly, although several pathological and functional alterations were evident in the initial phases, behavioural impairments were also maintained at later time points, indicating that locus coeruleus-driven pathology exerts long-lasting consequences. Interestingly, female mice exhibited colon shortening, providing evidence of a sex-specific pathological process at the level of the gut-brain axis. We believe that this model accurately replicates key prodromal features of Parkinson disease, demonstrating that alpha-synuclein-induced pathology in the locus coeruleus leads to functional circuit impairment and cognitive decline. Our findings emphasize the locus coeruleus as a critical site of early vulnerability in Parkinson Disease and underscore the importance of sex as a biological variable influencing disease progression and therapeutic response.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Accordingly, cortical-evoked N1 responses to balance perturbation, assessed using electroencephalography (EEG), are smaller in young and older adults with better balance. These responses may thus reflect individual balance challenge versus functional, or objective, task difficulty. However, the effect of balance expertise on cortical responses to balance perturbation has not been studied. We hypothesized that balance ability gained though long-term training facilitates more automatic balance control. Using professional modern dancers as balance experts, we compared cortical-evoked responses and biomechanics of the balance-correcting response between modern dancers and nondancers. We predicted that modern dancers would have smaller cortical-evoked responses and better balance recovery at equivalent levels of balance challenge. Support-surface perturbations were normalized to individual challenge levels by delivering perturbations scaled to 60% and 140% of each individual's step threshold. In contrast to our prediction, dancers exhibited larger N1 responses compared to nondancers while demonstrating similar biomechanical responses. Our results suggest dancers have greater cortical sensitivity to balance perturbations than nondancers. Further, dancer N1 responses modulated across perturbation magnitudes according to differences in objective task difficulty. In contrast, nondancer N1 responses modulated as a function of individual challenge level. Our findings suggest dance training increases sensitivity of the initial, cortical N1 response to balance perturbation, supporting postural alignment to an objective reference. The N1 response may reflect differences in balance-error processing that are altered with specific long-term training and may have implications for rehabilitation.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in social cognition and value-based decision-making, yet the neural mechanisms by which it encodes the relative value of competing social choices remain poorly understood. Here, we employed fiber photometry, optogenetics, and projection-specific recordings in mice performing four distinct binary social discrimination tasks to reveal how mPFC pyramidal neurons encode social choice. We found that mPFC pyramidal neurons exhibit profound inhibition during bouts toward the preferred stimulus. This inhibitory response was specific to transitional bouts, when animals switched between stimuli, and was absent during non-transitional bouts, which occurred during continued engagement with the same stimulus. Notably, this differential activity encoded relative rather than absolute stimulus value, such that the same stimulus evoked opposite neural responses depending on its contextual preference. Accordingly, manipulating the subject's preference between food and social stimuli via food deprivation inverted its inhibition-excitation pattern. Furthermore, negative calcium transients in the mPFC predicted subsequent investigation of the preferred stimulus, suggesting a functional role in guiding behavioral choice. Optogenetic activation of mPFC pyramidal neurons during stimulus investigation produced immediate aversion yet paradoxically biased the stimulated animal to persistently re-engage with the stimulus-associated option through repetitive non-transitional bouts. Finally, projection-specific recordings revealed that mPFC neurons targeting the nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala were differentially recruited across tasks, reflecting functional specialization of output pathways. Together, these findings identify inhibition of mPFC pyramidal neurons as a key neural signature for encoding relative stimulus preference, thereby establishing a neural principle by which the mPFC dynamically guides social choice.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Previous neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have suggested that the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and supplementary motor area (SMA) are involved in time perception. However, it remains inconclusive whether the activity in these regions is crucial for time perception, partly due to the possible spread of TMS effects across anatomically connected brain regions. Such a remote effect is less likely to happen with transcranial static magnet stimulation (tSMS), as the static magnetic field is expected to modulate the firing threshold of neurons rather than directly triggering an action potential. In this study, we aimed to determine the causal relevance of local activities in the right IPL and the SMA for temporal processing using tSMS. We measured duration discrimination thresholds, along with orientation discrimination thresholds as a control, using staircase methods before and during the administration of tSMS over the IPL/SMA. Our results indicated no significant changes in duration discrimination thresholds in either the IPL or SMA conditions. In contrast, we observed an improvement in orientation discrimination thresholds in the IPL condition. This improvement correlated with individual differences in the distance between the scalp and the IPL. Overall, our findings demonstrate a causal involvement of the IPL in orientation processing. The correlation between the effects of tSMS and the scalp-to-target distance suggests that the efficacy of tSMS may be sensitive to the strength of the magnetic field.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we used label-free, non-invasive optical metabolic imaging (OMI) of NAD(P)H and FAD to characterize the activation response of frozen T cells from healthy donors and lymphoma patients post-thaw.

Intercalated cells (ICs), specialized renal tubular epithelial cells responsible for proton secretion, are strategically positioned at the epithelial-immune interface, making them ideal sensors of stress signals and potential triggers of immune responses. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which ICs interact with immune cells to maintain renal immune homeostasis and contribute to the development of autoimmune kidney disease. We depleted Foxp3 regulatory T cells (Tregs) by injecting diphtheria toxin (DT) into male and female Foxp3-DTR mice. Two weeks after depletion, we observed autoimmune inflammation marked by increased renal immune infiltration, including neutrophils, macrophages, and subsets of T and B cells, along with the formation of ectopic lymphoid-like structures and enhanced antigen presentation. We found higher levels of renal autoantibodies in urine and serum, with antibodies depositing in glomeruli and tubules. Our analysis identified several renal antigens targeted by autoantibodies, suggesting their potential role in antibody-mediated renal injury. Kidney damage included smaller glomeruli, proximal tubular injury, an increased urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and decreased urine output. Disruption of immune tolerance led to the upregulation of inflammasome-related genes and IL-33 in ICs, which acts as a key alarmin signaling damage and promoting activation and expansion of Tregs. Our findings uncover a novel IC-Treg interaction mediated by the IL-33 pathway, revealing immune-regulating mechanisms that support renal immune tolerance. Although Tregs were initially depleted, a significant rebound in their numbers and function occurred.

Two inhibitors were used: panRAS-ON, which forms a ternary complex between cyclophilin and RAS in the GTP bound state; and panKRAS-off, which binds specifically to the KRAS switch II pocket. RAS inhibitors were found to significantly alter 16.5% of proteins in proximity to KRAS. Despite their distinct mechanisms-of-action, the KRAS inhibitors induced highly correlated changes in the KRAS interactomes. Among proteins in close proximity to KRAS, Afadin was found to be highly regulated by RAS inhibition. AFDN has been characterized as a key regulator of cell motility, invasion, and metastasis. Analysis of AFDN phosphorylation revealed that AKT only partially modulates p-Ser1718, while inhibition of KRAS is sufficient to abolish EGF-mediated AFDN phosphorylation. Knockdown of AFDN in a KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer model abolished chemotaxis in a transwell migration assay and disrupted directional movement in an EGF-driven wound healing model.

Compared with paired primary tumors, CRC brain metastases showed increased chromosomal instability, with activation of RNA-processing, stress response, and junctional remodeling pathways. After radiation treatment, resistant clones had increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition, while the immunosuppressive stroma remained intact. We identified tumor-derived MIF, GDF15, PRSS3 and SEMA3C ligands and macrophage-derived SPP1 that have the potential to affect multiple cell types in the metastatic niche. These ligand-receptor interactions drive angiogenesis, stromal activation and immune suppression. In a macrophage-tumor-fibroblast co-culture model, knockout of SPP1 in macrophages led to reduced expression of lipid-metabolism related genes and disrupted tumor-promoting interactions. Together, these results indicate that CRC growth in the brain is sustained by a specific cellular organization with immunosuppressive multicellular interactions.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Single-cell transcriptomic and histological analyses reveal that ecDNA-driven tumors rapidly establish an immunoevasive tumor microenvironment (TME), marked by increased myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) and reduced T cell infiltration. Mechanistically, ecDNA heterogeneity generates a subset of cancer cells with extremely high Kras expression, termed super-expressors, which secrete amphiregulin to promote myCAF expansion and suppress T cell infiltration. Clonally organized super-expressors establish an immunoevasive niche in the TME from patients with PDAC. Our findings demonstrate a causal role of ecDNA in TME remodeling, offering insights into cancer heterogeneity and immune evasion.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

However, a detailed description of neural dynamics underlying brain power fluctuations is missing. Here, we provide a proof of principle study that these dynamics can be described using two new dynamical systems measures: instability frequency and relative wandering time. These capture interactions between neural activity and the mesoscale oscillatory electric fields generated by it. The two measures seem to split low vs. high HDRS scores within a small patient cohort. They are motivated by the cytoelectric coupling hypothesis, that suggests that efficient information processing results from mesoscale electric fields; and that the re-emergence of depression symptoms might result from altered electric fields.

Recent cryo-electron microscopy and molecular-dynamics studies show that mechanical force transmitted through the T-cell receptor, the peptide-major histocompatibility complex, and the CD3 signaling module can enhance this sensitivity and thereby promote T-cell activation. We present a minimal energy-landscape model showing how force transmission reshapes the activation barrier and bond lifetime. Mathematically, we prove a sharp force cutoff \\(F_c = D_0/(2 d_0)\\) (maximum binding depth \\(D_0\\), optimal distance \\(d_0\\)) above which no bound state exists. At or below \\(F_c\\), the system admits at most two stationary points: a bound minimum and a saddle that coalesce in a fold (saddle-node) at the bond-breaking point. Stable binding occurs only on the near-separation branch \\(d < d_0 \\ln 2\\) (smaller receptor-ligand separation). Numerically, we tracked these stationary points as the force varied, computed the force-dependent barrier \\(\\Delta V_f\\), and mapped bond lifetimes using Kramers/Langer theory. We found that agonists and weak agonists follow a catch-slip pattern; barriers and lifetimes peak at intermediate forces, whereas antagonists exhibit slip, with barriers and lifetimes decreasing as force increases.

This strategy leverages both the physical knowledge of the system and the predictive power of machine learning methods, and it has been applied to a variety of bioprocesses. Nevertheless, it faces important challenges: (I) the often limited availability of experimental data and (II) the incorporation of uncertain mechanistic knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that generates mathematical models that enforce only minimal yet essential qualitative properties such as: non-negativity of state variables, biogenesis, and the requirement that biomass mediates both substrate uptake and product formation. This avoids reliance on kinetic expressions while ensuring that only certain knowledge is introduced, thus addressing (I). Because batch cultures are the standard experimental setup in early-stage bioprocess research and are routinely repeated under different conditions, we focus on this type of experiment to address (II). We propose a minibatch optimization scheme based on the ADAM optimizer, where each batch experiment naturally corresponds to a minibatch in the algorithm. Using both synthetic and experimental datasets, we show that only a few batch experiments are sufficient to train accurate and generalizable hybrid models, and that incorporating stochastic regularization provides better interpretability to the model. Overall, this work provides a structured and biologically grounded alternative to existing hybrid modeling approaches, improving how machine-learning tools can be integrated into bioprocess modeling under limited data and limited prior knowledge.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

However, the optimal configuration (e.g., the size and number of restored patches) of habitat, given a fixed total area, remains an unresolved question. Here, we ask whether restoring a single large habitat patch or a mixture of smaller patches of the same total area supports higher plant diversity. To address this question, we measured taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of all naturally recruiting woody species in 52 restored vegetation patches in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Thirteen restored patches of each of four sizes (25, 100, 400, and 1,600 m2) were established within conventional oil palm plantations six years before vegetation sampling. From these 52 patches, we generated 750 random comparisons between a single large patch vs. several small patches, ensuring equal total area (100, 400, or 1,600 m2). We evaluated taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity separately for all species, for native species, and for native forest species, using three diversity measures: species richness, the exponential of Shannon entropy, and the inverse of Simpson concentration. Our findings indicate that restoring several smaller patches results in greater taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of recruiting woody species than restoring a single large patch of the same total area. This result holds across the three total habitat areas (100, 400, and 1,600 m2), all species groupings, and all diversity metrics. As expected, species diversity also increased with total area in all cases. Our findings challenge restoration strategies that focus exclusively on enlarging patches. Instead, biodiversity will be enhanced by increasing the total restored area across many patches of different sizes, including very small ones (e.g., 25 m2).", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Abundance of insect herbivores often depends on host plant suitability for their specialised immature stages. Suitability can be strongly influenced by both microclimate and the nutritional quality of the plants themselves. Where soil nitrogen is high, host plants tend to have high nutritional quality, but vigorous growth of surrounding vegetation reduces microclimatic temperatures. Thus, thermophilous insects may face a choice between host plants with optimal microclimates and those with optimal nutritional quality. We investigated how microclimate and nitrogen content influence oviposition choices by the declining Small Copper butterfly, Lycaena phlaeas, on its host plant, Rumex acetosa. We predicted that warmer plants would have lower nitrogen content, and that butterflies would choose cooler, high-nitrogen plants during warmer ambient conditions. Although warmer R. acetosa plants had lower nitrogen content, L. phlaeas consistently chose to lay eggs on plants in warm microclimates, implying a trade-off between temperature and the nutritional quality of host plants. Patches of bare ground created by Talpa europaea (European Mole) near R. acetosa plants increased microclimatic temperatures and decoupled the negative association between nutritional quality and thermal suitability. Our results have implications for the conservation of thermophilous insect herbivores, especially close to their range margins and in the context of climate change. Rather than maximising host plant abundance or nutritional quality, management that creates suitable microclimatic conditions is likely to be critical. Our findings also suggest that, while nitrogen pollution may increase host plant nutritional quality, its negative impacts on microclimate will likely further reduce breeding habitat for L. phlaeas and other insects in grassland habitats.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Wild plant-pathogenic Pseudomonas compete using tailocins--phage-derived molecular weapons that bind to specific cell-surface receptors. Genomic surveys and functional assays reveal that the most broadly lethal tailocins remain rare--while the tailocin's production increases competitive killing, it also compromises plant colonization. We determine that the polymorphisms behind this tradeoff are not transient -- historical genomes spanning two centuries show that the tradeoff has been maintained for at least 105-106 generations. Our results demonstrate that, in natural populations, a tradeoff between competition and pathogenicity is fundamental and not easily overcome.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

However, even the fastest algorithms for inferring these networks face scalability challenges as the number of species increases. This limitation arises because these methods use as input a large concordance factors (CFs) table, which summarizes the observed CFs of all possible four-species combinations in each row. The size of this table scales with the fourth power of the number of species, creating computational bottlenecks and highlighting the need for more efficient solutions. Sparse learning has been shown to reduce the dimensionality of large-scale datasets while producing results of comparable quality to those obtained using the full dataset. In this study, we adapted two sparse machine learning models - Elastic Net and Ensemble Learning + Elastic Net - to guide the subsample of an optimal number of rows from the CFs table required to accurately predict the overall phylogenetic network pseudolikelihood. Both methods account for the inherent correlation among rows, which arises because rows overlap in species information. We call this method Qsin. In two simulated datasets, Qsin reduced the dataset by approximately half without compromising accuracy. For the Xiphophorus fishes dataset, which contains 10,626 rows in the CFs table, we recovered the same topology as with the full CFs table but using only 763 rows. Using these subsamples also reduced running times by up to 60% without compromising accuracy. These gains are expected to persist as species numbers increase. Qsin contributes to ongoing efforts to make phylogenetic network inference more efficient and opens the door to analyses of more complex evolutionary histories.

Interestingly, a genome-wide screen for gene loss events in vertebrate species identified the disruption of the GPRC6A gene in toothed whales, in contrast to widespread conservation in the closely related Bovidae family.

This chemical approach enables both one-step and two-step functionalization of adherent, suspension, and primary cells with diverse ligands, including imaging probes, carbohydrates, biotin, and proteins, without inducing cytotoxicity or immune activation. Membrane engineering through bioconjugation is emerging as a valuable tool in biomedical research, given the cell membrane's central role in signaling, transport, and cell-cell interactions. Compared to traditional glyco-engineering methods that often require multiday incubations and can cause cellular stress, our approach achieves precise and high-density grafting in less than one hour, with improved reproducibility and biological compatibility. Importantly, we demonstrate that this strategy can be applied to a variety of cell types, encompassing both immortalized cell lines and primary cells, notably Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and human effector cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, to enhance their cytotoxic function against EGFR-positive cancer cells via surface-conjugated Nanofitin. Moreover, we show that the bioconjugated signal diminishes over time due to cell division, offering a self-limiting alternative to permanent genetic modifications such as CAR-T, thereby mitigating risks associated with overly prolonged immune activation.

Conventional immunosuppressive therapies have reached their therapeutic ceiling, with mucosal healing and long-term remission remaining unmet therapeutic goals for many patients. Organoid-based regenerative therapy offers a new paradigm by reconstructing damaged mucosa rather than merely controlling inflammation. Methods: We hypothesized that fragmented intestinal organoids, building upon the foundational model established by Yui et al., whose use of immunodeficient Rag2-/- mice and surgical mucosal injury first demonstrated the feasibility of colon organoid transplantation. Our study advances this framework by introducing optimized transplantation timing and employing immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice to refine translational relevance and clinical feasibility, thereby extending the applicability of organoid therapy to more realistic physiological contexts., when transplanted rectally at an optimized time point, could integrate more efficiently into inflamed mucosa and accelerate epithelial regeneration even in an immunocompetent environment. A 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model was established in C57BL/6 mice. Intestinal organoids and crypts derived from EGFP-transgenic donors were cultured and transplanted rectally using a minimally invasive delivery system. Fluorescence microscopy, histological analysis, and clinical indices were used to evaluate engraftment and mucosal repair. Results: EGFP organoid fragments and crypts successfully engrafted at ulcerated sites, reconstituting epithelial structures and restoring mucosal integrity. Mice receiving organoid or crypts transplantation exhibited rapid weight recovery and reduced bleeding compared to DSS-only controls. Histological and fluorescence analyses confirmed epithelial restitution exceeding 60% by day 7 post-administration versus 18% in controls. These results validate the regenerative potential of organoid transplantation within an immunocompetent host.

Benchmark evaluations on public datasets show that under the mutation-level data splitting strategy, SAMAffinity outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence-based method AttABseq by 33.3%, 72.3%, 31.8%, and 30.5% on S1131, S4169, S645, and M1101 datasets, respectively. Moreover, under the complex-level data splitting strategy, SAMAffinity surpasses the structure-based method MpbPPI by 22.9%, 22.7%, 5.0%, and 11.4% on the corresponding datasets. Beyond predictive accuracy, the strong consistency between the model's predicted distribution and natural amino-acid mutation tendencies indicates that SAMAffinity effectively captures the underlying mutational landscape shaped by intrinsic biochemical and evolutionary factors. Based on this capability, SAMAffinity demonstrated strong generalization in a study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases, suggesting its potential for optimizing therapeutic antibody design.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Currently, there is no predictive framework that integrates methylation-aware binding specificity with 3D structure-based residue interactions for quantitatively assessing the impact of DNA methylation on protein-DNA interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce mIDEA (Methylation-informed Interpretable protein-DNA Energy Associative model), a structure-aware, residue-level biophysical framework that predicts and interprets protein-methylated-DNA interactions by optimizing an amino acid-nucleotide energy matrix explicitly accounting for the modulatory effect of 5-methylcytosine. We validate mIDEA across diverse human transcription factors with distinct CpG methylation preferences. Using only structural templates and prior biochemical knowledge, mIDEA accurately recapitulates both \"methyl-plus\" and \"methyl-minus\" effects of DNA methylation on protein-DNA binding. Incorporating quantitative methylation-sensitive binding data further enables mIDEA to capture position-specific methylation effects. When integrated with whole-genome methylation profiles, the model enhances in vivo binding-site prediction by reducing false positives while preserving sensitivity compared to models trained on unmethylated sequences. Overall, mIDEA provides a principled framework for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying methylation-modulated protein-DNA recognition.

However, variant calling on ONT data remains challenging due to platform-specific error profiles, particularly indels in homopolymer regions. Here, we introduce description and comprehensive benchmarks of the Sentieon DNAscope LongRead and DNAscope Hybrid pipelines on ONT whole-genome datasets, demonstrating high accuracy and substantially reduced computational requirements across SNP, Indel, and Structural Variant detection. Benchmarked against multiple truth sets including GIAB v4.2.1, CMRG, and T2T-Q100, DNAscope LongRead reduced SNP errors by ~50% relative to Clair3 across five reference samples and showed consistently higher accuracy in all non-long-homopolymer stratifications. Integration of ONT and Illumina short reads via DNAscope Hybrid further improved variant detection: with low depth ONT + Illumina datas, the pipeline achieved F1 scores of 0.9992 (SNPs) and 0.9979 (Indels), outperforming alternative pipelines. In challenging benchmarks such as T2T-Q100 and CMRG genes, DS-Hybrid reduced SNP and Indel errors significantly, compared to next-best methods. For structural variants, DNAscope pipelines outperformed alternative (e.g. Sniffles2), highlighting the advantages of haplotype-resolved SV detection method. Despite its accuracy, the Sentieon software suite remains computationally efficient: complete ONT long read FASTQ-to-VCF analysis completed within ~190 minutes on a 120-vCPU Azure instance, at costs less than $5 USD. Overall, the DNAscope LongRead and Hybrid pipelines deliver fast, accurate, and scalable germline variant calling for ONT datasets, providing a practical solution for comprehensive whole-genome analysis in both research and clinical genomics.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

While powerful, such analysis is challenging due to the inherent sparsity of single cell data. Results: We present the MetaFR approach to learn gene-specific models that link open-chromatin variation from scATAC-seq data to gene expression from scRNA-seq. Using efficient regression trees, we illustrate that accurate expression prediction models can be learned on the single-cell or meta-cell level. Validation was done using fine-mapped eQTLs. Meta-cell models were found to outperform single-cell models for most genes. Comparison to the SOTA method SCARlink revealed advantages of MetaFR in terms of runtime and prediction performance. MetaFR thus allows time-efficient analysis and obtains reliable models of gene expression prediction, which can be used to study gene regulation in any organism for which scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data is available.

C.; Holzer, E.; Martens, S.; Hummer, G.", "abstract": "Autophagy is a complex process in which eukaryotic cells degrade cytosolic components by delivering them to lysosomes via double-membrane autophagosomes. The lipid transfer protein ATG2A plays a crucial role in autophagosome formation by tethering the phagophore membrane to the ER and delivering a significant fraction of the required lipids. The mechanism by which ATG2A shuttles lipids from one membrane to the other, however, remains elusive. Here, we combine structural predictions, molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro lipid transfer assays to gain mechanistic insights into ATG2A-mediated lipid transport. Using this integrative approach, we characterize the contact sites of the protein with donor and acceptor membranes. Our simulations capture multiple events of lipid uptake and delivery from and to the bound membrane. Conformational rearrangements of N-terminal amphipathic helices emerge as a critical factor for facile lipid transport. With this insight, we designed an ATG2A mutant that transfers lipids three times faster than the wild type in vitro. In complex with ATG9A, ATG2A forms a bridge between two parallel membranes at [~]12 nm separation. Overall, our findings suggest that ATG2A is a lipid transporter gated at the N-terminus by blocking helices that, upon release, act as additional membrane tethers.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The increase in enzyme-catalyzed reaction rates with temperature is typically modeled using Arrhenius or Eyring relations. Interpretation of extracted parameters is subject to multiple caveats. Here we analyze the impact of expected small temperature variations of underlying activation/Eyring parameters on this modeling. Linear Arrhenius/Eyring behavior can still be observed when the underlying activation energy Ea or enthalpy {Delta}H and entropy {Delta}S vary with temperature. Modest variations -- of the order of an H-bond energy over 60 {degrees}C -- lead to large fractional deviations of Ea, {Delta}H and {Delta}S values derived from linear fits from their underlying values and to deviations of Arrhenius prefactors A by orders of magnitude. In a family of related enzymes with similar activation free energies {Delta}G , small differences in temperature variation of {Delta}H and {Delta}S will lead to apparent enthalpy-entropy compensation and may scramble enzyme ordering based on {Delta}H or {Delta}S. For enzymes from cold and warm-adapted species having largely similar active sites, small temperature variations of {Delta}H and {Delta}S may explain large differences in apparent {Delta}H values. Similar considerations apply to interpretation of van 't Hoff plots of equilibrium measurements and related observations of enthalpy-entropy compensation. Complementary methods including simulations and multi-temperature static and time-resolved atomic-resolution structural studies should play a key role in interpreting temperature-dependent kinetic and equilibrium data from enzymatic systems.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Here using a clinically relevant RNA-lipoplex vaccine, we investigated efficacy constraints in a preclinical model. Vaccination remodeled the tumor microenvironment (TME), increasing T cell infiltration and promoting a proinflammatory myeloid compartment. This was associated with complete regression of smaller, immature tumors, but only delayed growth of larger, established tumors. While vaccine-induced T cells were long-lived and functional in peripheral tissues, intratumoral T cells declined rapidly in abundance, diversity, and function, reverting to a prevaccine-like state. scRNA-seq suggested that this was driven by a pro-apoptotic program, with surviving T cells showing signatures of cellular stress and impaired activation. Importantly, recurrent vaccination replenished functional T cells in the TME and enhanced efficacy. These findings highlight the importance of optimizing vaccine schedules and tailoring therapeutic strategies to tumor stage.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Characterisation of forty-five single-chain variable fragment (scFv) intrabodies expressed in human cells confirmed charge to have the greatest impact on solubility. We created new interdomain linkers, optimised scFv domain orientation and found variable heavy domain framework sites to be generally positively charged, and promote insolubility, but be amenable to optimisation. This is applied in combination to reduce the search space and refine the products of AI-led inverse folding to create highly soluble, abundant and thermally stable intrabodies that maintain parent antibody epitope recognition. Over six hundred intrabody sequences are described targeting sixty cytoplasmic proteins with linear, conformational, post-translational modification or oligomeric state specificity.

A.", "abstract": "Heart injury triggers a robust cellular response in zebrafish, characterized by neovascularization, immune cell activation, and the infiltration of proliferative cardiomyocytes that collectively lead to scarless regeneration. Upon injury, damage-associated molecular patterns are released by dying cells and injured extracellular matrix. These molecules bind to pattern recognition receptors on various cell types, promoting inflammation and immune cell recruitment by upregulating chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We previously identified the activation of injury-induced interferon signaling as a distinguishing feature between the regenerative zebrafish and non-regenerative medaka. Here, we establish interferon-{Phi}1 (IFN{phi}1) as the primary driver of interferon signaling after zebrafish heart injury. IFN{phi}1 expression is induced hours after injury and directs interferon-stimulated gene expression, which peaks at 72 hours post-injury. This response is lost in ifnphi1 mutants, which disrupt IFN{phi}1 expression. ifnphi1 mutants have reduced neutrophil recruitment to the injured myocardium, while macrophages and neovascularization are unaffected. By studying later stages of regeneration, we find that ifnphi1 mutant hearts have a modest defect in scar resolution. Collectively, these findings uncover a critical early signaling cascade during the inflammatory response to heart injury and provide new insights into the mechanisms that choreograph zebrafish heart regeneration.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Spatial and spatiotemporal models are increasingly used in ecology for a range of purposes, such as tracking population change, assessing species distributions, and modelling spatial processes. Many models, including generalized additive models (GAMs) and Gaussian random fields (fit via the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation [SPDE] approach), approximate spatial surfaces using basis functions defined over a set of knots or mesh vertices. A common assumption is that higher resolution approximations with more knots yield better predictions, but this is rarely tested. We develop three case studies and a simulation to understand how mesh resolution affects prediction quality and parameter estimates. Using temperature and groundfish data from U.S. West Coast fish surveys, we developed spatial and spatiotemporal models of ocean temperature and fish biomass density. We fit models with varying mesh complexity and assessed prediction quality using log predictive density (log score) with k-fold cross-validation. We also compared SPDE approaches to GAMs. Our temperature models showed that the finest scale meshes decreased log predictive density. As mesh complexity increased, estimated spatial range, spatial variance, and observation error declined. Groundfish models showed similar patterns: more vertices led to smaller estimated spatial range and variance parameters. For most species, mesh resolution had little effect on area-weighted biomass indices, but it did affect scale for some. Simulations showed that predictive density declined with increasing mesh complexity, especially under fine-scale spatial variability, high spatial variance, and low observation error. Root mean square error remained stable, indicating that degraded predictive densities stemmed from poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates rather than reduced accuracy of predictions. Our work highlights that practitioners should not assume predictive performance always improves with increased spatial complexity. Selecting appropriate spatial complexity is expected to improve parameter estimation accuracy and derived quantities when out-of-sample prediction is a focus of inference.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Background: While primarily a disease of tropical and subtropical regions, dengue outbreaks are increasing in non-endemic regions due to environmental change and increasing travel and trade. For these non-endemic regions, estimating the risk of dengue is challenging as transmission is driven by both local environmental conditions and the introduction of viremic travelers. In this study, we aimed to estimate current and future dengue risk in California, USA--a region that has recently experienced its first cases of locally-acquired dengue. Methods: We modeled dengue risk as the product of three key components needed for local transmission--vector presence, temperature-suitability for pathogen transmission, and viral introductions via travel-associated cases--estimated using vector and case surveillance, sociodemographic, and environmental data. We estimated risk for locations and months where local transmission was reported in 2023-2024 to define a 'threshold' level of risk. We then projected monthly, census tract-level risk under both current conditions and future scenarios of climate warming and urban expansion. Findings: Approximately 18.2 million (95% CI: 17.9-18.3) California residents--primarily in the Central Valley and the Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas--currently live in areas where peak monthly dengue risk exceeds levels estimated during observed local transmission. Under moderate scenarios of climate warming and urban expansion, an additional 4.1 million (95% CI: 3.7-4.6) California residents may be at risk by mid-century, with the largest increase in risk estimated for September and for the Sacramento Valley and coastal southern California regions. Outside the summer months and beyond the Central Valley and southern California, current and future risk remains low due to one or more major bottlenecks to transmission. Interpretation: Our study identifies the specific regions and months conducive to dengue transmission in the non-endemic setting of California. At present, this covers a substantial portion of the state and is projected to expand under on-going climate warming and urbanization. Our results underscore the need for sustained vector control, and timely detection and management of travel-associated cases.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}

Anticipating where invasive species are likely to establish, as well as the potential impact of climate change on their range expansion, is essential for early detection and targeted management.

Our model accurately predicts the species' current range in Iberia and identifies additional climatically suitable areas, particularly in southern and western Europe. Under warming scenarios of +2 {degrees}C and +4 {degrees}C, suitable areas expand northwards, with over two-thirds of Europe classified as suitable under the most extreme scenario. These results suggest that the species is already operating near the cold limits of its thermal niche in parts of its invasive range, and that rising temperatures may remove these constraints, allowing expansion into previously unsuitable areas.

ISR allows enhanced protection of aboveground plant parts against herbivores before IR induction. Both ISR and IR are systemic and may involve the production of toxic, antifeedant and/or repellent compounds, and/or reduce nutrient availability, which may in consequence affect plant usability and palatability for later arriving herbivores. The combined effects of ISR and IR on different herbivores sharing the same plant and plant performance have been rarely addressed. Here, we assessed the effects of three plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), Azotobacter chroococcum, Azospirillum brasilense and Pseudomonas brassicacearum, on the defense response and physiology of strawberry plants upon sequential attack by two herbivores with different feeding modes, two-spotted spider mites Tetranychus urticae and cotton aphids Aphis gossypii. Attack of strawberry plants by spider mites and aphids adversely affected the abundance of the later arriving herbivore, mediated by the host plant's defense system. First-attacking spider mites exerted much stronger adverse effects on later attacking aphids than first-attacking aphids on later attacking spider mites. In absence of PGPR inoculation, the herbivores, especially first-attacking spider mites, severely impaired host plant physiology and productivity. PGPR inoculation primed the plant's defense system to attack by spider mites and aphids, allowing the plants to produce more secondary metabolites such as phenols. In consequence, the abundances of both herbivores were lower on PGPR-inoculated plants compared to chemically fertilized and control plants. Overall, our study suggests that PGPR inoculation ameliorates the plant damage caused by sequentially attacking herbivores. Additionally, the PGPRs improve the physiology and productivity, and favorably balance the nutritional state, of strawberry plants.", "date": "2025-11-16", "journal": ""}
