High-resolution intracellular compositions of individual monocytes are quantitatively measured in terms of the three-dimensional distribution of refractive index values using holotomography, which are then analyzed using machine-learning algorithms to train for the classification into three distinct immune states: normal, hyper-inflammation, and immune suppression. The immune status prediction accuracy of the machine-learning holotomography classifier was 83.7% and 99.9% for one and six cell measurements, respectively.

D.; Torrellas, J.; McKenna, R.; Vo, Q.; Mietzsch, M.; Borchelt, D. R.; Prokop, S.; Chakrabarty, P.", "abstract": "The two most prominent post-translational modifications of pathologic tau are Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation and Lys acetylation. Whether acetylation impacts the susceptibility of tau to templated seeding in diseases like Alzheimer disease (AD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is largely uncharacterized. Towards this, we examined how acetylation mimicking or nullifying mutations on five sites of tau (K311, K353, K369, K370, K375), located within the tau filament core, influenced the susceptibility of P301L (PL) tau to seeds from AD (AD-tau) or PSP (PSP-tau) in HEK293T cells. Acetyl-mimicking substitutions of individual Lys sites to Glutamine as well as mutation of all 5 sites together (PL+5K-Q and PL+5K-R) had inconsistent effects on tau seeding by AD-tau or PSP-tau seeds. Unexpectedly, mutating all 5 sites to Alanine (PL+5K-A) resulted in a tau variant that spontaneously aggregated. These aggregates were amorphous and yet able to propagate to naive cells expressing P301L tau but not wild-type tau. Previously, we reported that a phospho-mimetic S305E mutation in PL tau abrogated seeding by AD-tau but not PSP-tau seeds in the HEK293T cells. To assess how changes in acetylation and phosphorylation together could influence seeding, we combined the S305E and the 5K-Q mutations in P301L tau, creating a variant that retained specificity for PSP-tau seeds over AD-tau seeds. Our findings indicate that phosphorylation of tau at Ser305 is a strong determinant of disease-specific tau templating, even in the presence of hyperacetylation within the fibril core domain. Overall, our findings suggest that acetylation could be a secondary modifier of misfolded hyper-phosphorylated tau seeds.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

S.; Eugene, M.; Munoz-Tamayo, R.", "abstract": "Ruminants play an important role in global warming by emitting enteric methane (CH4) through the degradation of feeds by the rumen microbiota. To better understand the dynamics fermentation outputs, including CH4 and volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, mathematical models have been developed. Sensitivity analysis (SA) methods quantify the contribution of model input parameters (IP) to the variation of an output variable of interest. In animal science, SA are usually conducted in static condition. In this work, we hypothesized that including the dynamic aspect of the rumen fermentation to SA can be useful to inform on optimal experimental conditions aimed at quantifying the key mechanisms driving CH4 and VFA production. Accordingly, the objective of this work was to conduct a dynamic SA of a rumen fermentation model under in vitro continuous conditions (close to the real in vivo conditions). Our model case study integrates the effect of the macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis (AT) on the fermentation. AT has been identified as a potent CH4 inhibitor via the presence of bromoform, an anti-methanogenic compound. We computed Shapley effects over time for quantifying the contribution of 16 IPs to CH4 (mol/h) and VFA (mol/l) variation. Shapley effects integrate the three contribution types of an IP to output variable variation (individual, via the interactions and via the dependence/correlation). We studied three diet scenarios accounting for several doses of AT relative to Dry Matter (DM): control (0% DM of AT), low treatment (LT: 0.25% DM of AT) and high treatment (HT: 0.50% DM of AT). Shapley effects revealed that hydrogen (H2) utilizers microbial group via its Monod H2 affinity constant highly contributed (> 50%) to CH4 variation with a constant dynamic over time for control and LT. A shift on the impact of microbial pathways driving CH4 variation was revealed for HT. IPs associated with the kinetic of bromoform utilization and with the factor modeling the direct effect of bromoform on methanogenesis were identified as influential on CH4 variation in the middle of fermentation. Whereas, VFA variation for the three diet scenarios was mainly explained by the kinetic of fibers degradation, showing a high constant contribution (> 30%) over time. The simulations computed for the SA were also used to analyze prediction uncertainty. It was related to the dynamic of dry matter intake (DMI, g/h), increasing during the high intake activity periods and decreasing when the intake activity was low. Moreover, CH4 (mol/h) simulations showed a larger variability than VFA simulations, suggesting that the reduction of the uncertainty of IPs describing the activity of the H2 utilizers microbial group is a promising lead to reduce the overall model uncertainty. Our results highlighted the dynamic nature of the influence of metabolic pathways on CH4 productions under an anti-methanogenic treatment. SA tools can be further exploited to design optimal experiments studying rumen fermentation and CH4 mitigation strategies. These optimal experiments would be useful to build robust models that can guide the development of sustainable nutrition strategies.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Genes that encode antibiotic resistance are often harbored on plasmids, extra-chromosomal DNA molecules found in bacteria. The emergence of multiresistance plasmids is particularly problematic and demands the development of new antibiotics and alternative strategies. CRISPR-Cas derived tools with their sequence specificity offer a promising new approach to combating antibiotic resistance. By introducing CRISPR-Cas encoding plasmids that target antibiotic resistance genes on plasmids, the susceptibility of bacteria to conventional antibiotics can be restored. However, genetic variation within bacterial populations can hinder the effectiveness of such CRISPR-Cas tools by allowing some mutant plasmids to evade CRISPR-mediated cleaving or gene silencing. In this study, we develop a model to test the effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas in sensitizing bacterial populations carrying resistance on non-transmissible plasmids and assess the success probability of a subsequent treatment with conventional antibiotics. We evaluate this probability according to the target interference mechanism, the copy number of the resistance-encoding plasmid, and its compatibility with the CRISPR-Cas encoding plasmid. Our results identify promising approaches to revert antibiotic resistance with CRISPR-Cas encoding plasmids: A DNA-cleaving CRISPR-Cas system on a plasmid incompatible with the targeted plasmid is most effective for low copy numbers, while for resistance plasmids with higher copy numbers gene silencing by CRISPR-Cas systems encoded on compatible plasmids is the superior solution.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Earlier studies have shown a deep divergence between freshwater and marine clades of goniomonads that comprise large genetic distances between members within the group and also between the two groups of marine and freshwater taxa. Still, marine and freshwater species carry the same genus name, and until up to date only few species have been described. We therefore restructured goniomonad systematics based not only on a separation of marine and freshwater taxa, but, taking the large genetic distances into account, also several new genera are described.

New methods to understand the underlying neurogenetics are valuable for designing personalised interventional strategies. Here, we used a novel, two-choice self-administration zebrafish assay (SAZA) to isolate the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit alpha3 ( chrna3 ) in alcohol response. Juvenile zebrafish exhibited a biphasic response when self-administering alcohol that transitioned from attraction to aversion within minutes, suggesting they can regulate alcohol exposure. This inverted U-shaped self-administration mirrored the effect alcohol has on shoaling behaviour. Exposure to low concentrations of alcohol reduced anxiety-like behaviours, while sedative effects became prominent at higher concentrations resulting in reduced locomotion and uncoordinated swimming. In contrast, these responses are blunted in chrna3 mutants. They exhibit prolonged alcohol self-administration, and increased gregariousness. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission alongside cholinergic signaling is impacted in the mutant brains. Our results thus suggest that chrna3 dysfunction has a systemic change with an increase in alcohol tolerance being one effect.

We present a program, COALISPR, for explicit and transparent application of negative control data in the comparison of high-throughput sequencing results. This yields mapping coordinates that guide fast counting of reads, bypassing the need for a reference file, and is especially relevant when small RNA sequencing libraries contaminated with breakdown products are analysed for poorly annotated organisms. We have re-analysed small RNA datasets for mouse and fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, leading to consistent identification of miRNAs and of fungal transcripts targeted by siRNAs. Cryptococcal Argonautes are directed to spliced transcripts indicating that RNAi must be triggered by events downstream of intron removal. Negative control datasets contain large amounts of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragments (rRFs). These differ from small RNAs associated with RNAi, making a biological role for rRFs in association with Argonautes unlikely. Background signals enabled identification of cryptococcal genes for RNase P, U1 snRNA, 37 H/ACA and 63 Box C/D snoRNAs, including U3 and U14 essential for pre-rRNA processing.

Direct anatomical evidence from Neodiapsida, which includes the reptile crown-group Sauria and its closest extinct relatives, shows that this diversity originates from a single common reptilian ancestor that lived some 255 million years ago in the Paleozoic. However, the evolutionary assembly of crown reptile traits is poorly understood due to the lack of anatomically close outgroups to Neodiapsida1-7. We present a substantially revised phylogenetic hypothesis, informed by new anatomical data derived from high-resolution synchrotron tomography of Paleozoic reptiles8-12. We find strong evidence placing the clade Millerettidae as a close sister to Neodiapsida, which uniquely share a suite of derived features among Paleozoic stem reptiles. This grouping, for which we name the new clade Parapleurota, replaces previous phylogenetic paradigms by rendering the group Parareptilia as a polyphyletic assemblage of stem reptiles, of which millerettids are the most crownward. Our analysis presents hypotheses that resolve long-standing issues in Paleozoic reptile evolution, including the placement of captorhinids on the amniote stem lineage and firm support for varanopids as synapsids, which taken together provide a greatly improved fit to the observed stratigraphic record. Optimizations of character evolution on our phylogenetic hypothesis reveals gradual assembly of crown reptile anatomy, including a Permian origin of tympanic hearing, the presence of a lower temporal fenestra in the amniote common ancestor, with subsequent modifications on the reptile stem lineage, leading to the loss of the lower temporal bar. This evolutionary framework provides a platform for investigating the subsequent radiations of the reptile crown group in the Early Triassic, including the lines leading to dinosaurs (including birds), crocodilians, lepidosaurs, and extinct marine reptiles.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Previous studies of epithelial folding have revealed diverse mechanisms driven by epithelium-intrinsic or -extrinsic forces. Yet little is known about the biomechanical basis of epithelial splitting, which involves extreme folding and eventually a topological transition breaking the epithelial tube. Here, we leverage tracheal-esophageal separation (TES), a critical and highly conserved morphogenetic event during tetrapod embryogenesis, as a model system for interrogating epithelial tube splitting both in vivo and ex vivo. Comparing TES in chick and mouse embryos, we identified an evolutionarily conserved, compressive force exerted by the mesenchyme surrounding the epithelium, as being necessary to drive epithelial constriction and splitting. The compressive force is mediated by localized convergent flow of mesenchymal cells towards the epithelium. We further found that Sonic hedgehog (SHH) secreted by the epithelium functions as an attractive cue for mesenchymal cells. Removal of the mesenchyme, inhibition of cell migration, or loss of SHH signaling all abrogate TES, which can be rescued by externally applied pressure. These results unveil the biomechanical basis of epithelial splitting and suggest plausible mesenchymal origins of tracheal-esophageal birth defects.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

The host defense against pneumococci relies heavily on macrophages, which can effectively internalize and degrade bacteria. Recent studies have implicated both canonical and non-canonical autophagy-related processes in bacterial clearance, but the precise pathways mediating defense against S. pneumoniae remain unknown. Here, we utilize a well-established zebrafish larval infection model to investigate the role of autophagy in host defense against pneumococci in vivo. Using a transgenic macroautophagy/autophagy reporter line, we found the autophagy marker Map1lc3/Lc3 being recruited to pneumococci-containing vesicles upon bacterial internalization by zebrafish macrophages. The genetic inhibition of core autophagy gene atg5 led to loss of the Lc3 associations and their impaired acidification, significantly delaying bacterial clearance. This Lc3 recruitment is partially mediated by LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), as knockdown of cyba and rubcn moderately reduced Lc3 association with phagosomes and diminished pneumococcal degradation. Interestingly, we observed no involvement of xenophagy components in S. pneumoniae-infected macrophages, suggesting the activation of another non-canonical autophagy pathway, distinct from LAP, targeting pneumococci-containing phagosomes. Instead, we found that the pneumococcal pore-forming toxin pneumolysin induces ROS-independent CASM pathways, one of which is abolished by knockdown of tecpr1a indicating the involvement of sphingomyelin-Tecpr1-induced LC3 lipidation (STIL). Collectively, our observations shed new light on the host immune response against S. pneumoniae, demonstrating that several distinct non-canonical autophagy pathways mediate bacterial degradation by macrophages and providing potential targets for the development of novel therapies to combat pneumococcal infections.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we propose a simple and biologically plausible solution: local deviations from precise excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance encode error signals that instruct synaptic plasticity. Using a computational model derived from an adaptive control theory framework, we demonstrate that targeted feedback to inhibitory interneurons, which perturbs the E/I balance, can produce neuron- or assembly-specific error signals that enable learning in multilayer networks. Simulations reveal that such a balance-controlled plasticity mechanism is consistent with phenomenological local plasticity models while enabling online learning in hierarchically organized networks.

FEG-SEM analysis of the surface of RSV-infected cells labelled with an anti-G protein antibody revealed the presence of virus filaments and clusters of the G protein distributed intermittently along their surface. RSV-infected cells thinly coated with chromium were imaged using FEG-SEM and revealed a distinct structured surface topology consisting of closely packed surface domains. The G protein clusters were only associated within a subset of these domains which suggested that this structured topology was mainly derived from the host cell, and the presence of the cell glycocalyx that coats the virus filaments was further suggested. Imaging of RSV-infected cells using AFM was undertaken as a different but complementary approach to the FEG-SEM analysis. Imaging using AFM revealed a similar structured surface topology on the virus filaments to that observed in the FEG-SEM analysis, indicating the consistency in the appearance of the virus surface topology using these different methods. Collectively, this study provides the first detailed imaging of the surface topology of the virus filaments as they form on RSV-infected cells. The imaging data is consistent with the envelopment of the virus filaments by the glycocalyx and highlights the complexity of the spatial organisation within the viral envelope.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Differentiation therapy aims to reprogram tumor cells into more mature, less aggressive states to counteract this plasticity. Here, we identify cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) as a novel therapeutic target that promotes sustained differentiation in breast cancer. Using tumor-derived organoids from both mouse models and patient biopsies, we show that brief, low-dose exposure to phytogenic or synthetic CB2R ligands induces a basal-to-luminal switch, suppresses stemness, and reduces invasiveness and self-renewal. These phenotypic changes are associated with decreased tumor initiation and aggressiveness in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that CB2R activation initiates transient chromatin remodeling and epigenetic reprogramming, resulting in a stably differentiated state. Importantly, CB2R-driven differentiation sensitizes tumor cells to tamoxifen, enabling lower therapeutic doses with improved efficacy-supporting the principles of adaptive therapy aimed at long-term disease control. Our findings position CB2R modulation as a promising non-cytotoxic strategy to restrict cancer plasticity and enhance the effectiveness of existing breast cancer treatments.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

MEFI encodes a fusion protein that assembles virus-like particles (VLPs) and encapsulates both itself and cargo mRNA into these VLPs, orchestrating reproduction of VLPs from targeted cells and continuous intercellular spreading. MEFI significantly amplified cargo protein expression in the transfected cell populations (~20-fold ) and in organs (~500-fold in lung ) from mice administered systemically. Notably, through intramuscular injection of naked plasmids, MEFI promoted robust (~20-fold ) and durable (~2-month ) cargo expression, interorgan mRNA transfer, and successful crossing of the blood-brain barrier.

Subtype-specific transcription factor binding site (TFBS) variations within the LTR significantly influence latency and reservoir stability. In earlier work, we identified HIV-1C LTR variants with duplicated TFBS motifs, including NF-{kappa}B, AP1, RBEIII, and TCF-/LEF-1. Using five cell models, including Jurkat and primary CD4+ T cells, we compared canonical R-LTR and variant R2-LTR strains. Across sub-genomic reporters, single-round infections, and full-length viral vectors, we found that the balance between RBEIII and NF-{kappa}B motifs governs stability of latency. The two-viruses-one-cell system that normalized confounding environmental factors further revealed that latency is primarily controlled by intrinsic transcriptional circuits rather than external stimuli. In longitudinal studies of HIV-1C; individuals from acute and chronic infection phases, we observed dominant R strains during early infection and the spontaneous emergence of R2 strains in nearly half of chronic-phase subjects, a process accelerated by ART. Upon CD4+ T cell activation, R strains preferentially rebounded, while R2 strains showed strong resistance to reversal, even in subjects harbouring a co-infection. Together, these findings establish the clinical significance of LTR variation in latency regulation and identify the R2 phenotype as a critical determinant of reservoir persistence.

In this study, we used spatial transcriptomics to quantify host and viral gene expression at the maternal-fetal interface at near single-cell resolution. Guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection after mid-gestation causes focal infections at the base of the main placenta. Samples for spatial transcriptomics were collected from guinea pigs infected with GPCMV at 35 days gestation. Viral loads and the location of infected cells in placentas were assessed using virus-specific droplet digital PCR and in situ hybridization at 21 days post-infection. Representative placentas were sectioned onto Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slides and sequencing libraries were prepared from six infected and six uninfected tissue sections. Spatial transcriptomes from 33,687 55-{micro}m spots were generated and used in subsequent analyses. To assess how infection affected gene expression at the maternal-fetal interface, a combination of graph-based clustering and manual classification was used to assign spatial transcriptomes to clusters representative of different anatomic regions. Infection dysregulated more transcripts in the decidua and junctional zone than in the labyrinth or non-capillarized syncytium. Notably, infection downregulated transcripts involved in lipid metabolism and upregulated transcripts involved in antiviral defense and chemokine signaling. A second analysis compared the spatial transcriptomes of GPCMV-infected cells and their immediate microenvironment with similar regions in uninfected placentas. A transcriptional signature indicative of immune activation was clear in this comparison, and the local placental response to cytomegalovirus infection was driven by upregulated chemokine signaling. Thus, spatial transcriptomics revealed regional patterns of gene expression in the guinea pig placenta and illuminated how the host response to GPCMV may compromise placental function.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

To overcome these challenges, there is a critical need for a suitable animal model that mimics human disease through the natural route of infection via mites. Here, we report for the first time that a genetically engineered humanized mouse strain (with triple knockout/knock-in of IFN-{gamma} and its receptors), exhibits increased susceptibility to intradermal Ot infection compared to wild-type (WT) mice. This is evidenced by greater body weight loss, elevated bacterial burden, and reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).

Cortical microcircuits might contribute to this cognitive goal by either completing or cancelling predictable activity, but it remains unknown whether, and how, a single circuit can implement these antagonistic computations. To address this central question, we used all-optical physiology to simulate sensory-evoked activity patterns in pyramidal cells (PCs) and somatostatin interneurons (SSTs) in the mouse primary visual cortex. In the absence of external visual input, photostimulation of orientation-tuned PC ensembles drove either completion or cancelation of input-matching representations, depending on the number of photostimulated cells. This dual computational capacity arose from the co-existence of \"like-to-like\" excitatory interactions between PCs, and a newly discovered \"like-to-like\" SST-PC connectivity motif, in which SSTs are preferentially recruited by, and in turn suppress, similarly tuned PCs. Finally, we show that photoactivation of tuned SST ensembles during visual processing improved the discriminability of their preferred visual input by suppressing ambiguous activity. Thus, these complementary feature-specific connectivity motifs allow different strategies of contextual modulation to optimize inference by either completion (through PC-PC interactions) or cancelation (via PC-SST-PC loops) of predictable activity, depending on the structure of the input and the network state.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a chemical proteomic strategy to delineate how PTM states remodel protein ligandability in human cells. By deploying broad profiling photoaffinity probes, we identified over 400 functionally diverse proteins whose ability to engage small molecules is impacted by phosphorylation or N-linked glycosylation status. Integration of binding site mapping with structural analyses revealed a diverse array of PTM-dependent pockets. Among these targets, we discovered that the phosphorylation status of common oncogenic KRAS mutants impact the action of small molecules, including clinically approved inhibitors.

We employed an in-silico approach using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the interaction and stability of antibiotics with SF. We also assessed the structural stability of SF when conjugated with these antibiotics. Molecular level characterization using a blind docking approach and MD simulation revealed that Doxycycline exhibited the strongest binding affinity of -6.0 kcal/mol, compared with both Tetracycline (-5.9 kcal/mol) and Minocycline (-5.7 kcal/mol). The MMPBSA analysis also showed that Doxycycline exhibited the highest binding energy of -25.71 kcal/mol compared to Tetracycline (-18.27 kcal/mol) and Minocycline (-10.8 kcal/mol). The strong binding energy and stability of Doxycycline with SF was attributed mainly by van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. To evaluate the stability of protein-antibiotic complexes, 100 ns MD simulations were performed. The RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, SASA, and DSSP analyses revealed that SF was stable without much deformation upon docking of all three antibiotics.

Preclinical models such as cervical 2 (C2) hemisection (C2HS), resulting in disrupted communication between the respiratory centers and the phrenic motoneurons (PMN) pool, have been used since decades to study respiratory dysfunction and neuroinflammation after cSCI. Recently, contusive injuries such as C3 hemi-contusion (C3HC) have been increasingly used, as they induce phrenic motoneuron damage and offer a more clinically relevant model of SCI. However, these two different models may engage distinct pathophysiological cascades, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings across injury paradigms. In this study, we compared neuroimmune responses following C2HS or C3HC in mice. Animals underwent C2HS or C3HC, and spinal cord segments (C1-C8) were collected seven days post-injury for immuno-histological analyses around the lesion level and flow cytometry analyses at the lesion level. We observed that C2HS preserved more neurons and exhibited elevated CD86 and F4/80 expression. These markers are typically expressed by activated microglia and are indicative of a response oriented toward phagocytic and reparative functions. This phenotype was associated with limited pro-inflammatory cell infiltration and normalized level of systemic IL-6 in this model. Conversely, C3HC induced more extensive tissue damage, heightened microglial activation, a trend toward increased astrocytic reactivity, and significantly elevated CSPG levels on the contralateral side. Moreover, a persistent NK cell, neutrophil, and CD43 antigen-presenting cells infiltration, along with persistently high circulating IL-6 has been observed following C3HC. These findings demonstrate distinct neuroinflammatory signatures and repairing mechanisms between models, with C2HS promoting a microglia profile toward repair and C3HC leading to a prolonged and potentially harmful immune response.

Such a transition likely reflects dynamic neurophysiological changes within central auditory and non-auditory networks. Our integrated model of tinnitus posits that sensory precision (sensory weighting) may be heightened during the acute stages of tinnitus to resolve degraded auditory input, but in chronic tinnitus, its role may diminish as plastic processes take over the percept's maintenance. Consequently, we hypothesize that bottom-up neural mechanisms linked to initiation of tinnitus, such as central gain and neural synchrony, are maximal around the time of tinnitus onset, but later subside by way of regression to the mean. We evaluated this hypothesis by measuring central auditory reactivity through the Intensity Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potential (IDAEP), a non-invasive index of higher-order inhibitory processing within the auditory system. A steeper IDAEP slope is associated with heightened sensory reactivity (higher sensitivity to changes in auditory stimuli), indicative of reduced central inhibition. Conversely, a shallower slope reflects greater inhibitory control. Studying a group with acute tinnitus (onset within six weeks), with a repeated assessment after six months from onset, we found an initially increased IDAEP slope in the acute stage, which had significantly reduced at follow-up, supporting our hypothesis that there is increased sensory reactivity during tinnitus onset, which need not persist in order for tinnitus to become chronic.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

However, the evidence for local adaptation on contrasting soils in this region remains limited. Using a reciprocal translocation and common garden approach, we use the polymorphic geophyte Gladiolus carneus to test for local adaptation to soil properties along an elevational gradient. Methods: We first quantified the edaphic niche of all ecotypes of G. carneus across its entire range and for three experimental populations used for reciprocal translocations. Next, under common garden conditions, we tested whether the three focal populations had a fitness advantage on their native soils relative to other populations. We then assessed whether those same populations showed evidence of local adaptation. Key results: We found that G. carneus ecotypes occupied distinct edaphic niches and that our three experimental populations occurred in nutrient-poor, intermediate-nutrient and nutrient-rich soil conditions. The common garden showed that seedlings native to the nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites, experienced a fitness advantage over non-native seedlings. Additionally, we found evidence of local adaptation at all translocation sites. Together, the common garden and reciprocal translocation suggests that edaphic conditions are contributing to local adaptation at the nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites. Conclusions: We provide the first evidence of local adaptation to edaphic niches in the hyper-diverse Cape Floristic Region.

Ganfeborole is also a potent time-dependent inhibitor of Escherichia coli LeuRS (ecLeuRS, IC50 2 nM), however no antibacterial activity is observed towards E. coli up to 1 mM ganfeborole despite the observation that less potent ganfeborole analogs have antibacterial activity. To rationalize this observation, we propose that ganfeborole forms a complex with AMP that binds to the ecLeuRS editing site but does not impact aminoacylation. In support, addition of 12.5 M norvaline generates a ganfeborole MIC of 0.4 M since ecLeuRS is unable to hydrolyze norvaline-tRNALeu. Additionally, mutations that reduce the affinity and residence time of ganfeborole-AMP on ecLeuRS result in antibacterial activity. We propose that the activity of ganfeborole towards Mtb is because mtLeuRS is a highly vulnerable target so that only low levels of enzyme need to be inhibited by the ganfeborole-tRNALeu complex in contrast to ecLeuRS, which we previously demonstrated is a low vulnerability target.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

P.; Bitbol, A.-F.", "abstract": "Language models starting from biological sequence data are advancing many inference problems, both at the scale of single proteins, and at the scale of genomic neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce ProteomeLM, a transformer-based language model that reasons on entire proteomes from species spanning the tree of life. Leveraging protein language model embeddings, ProteomeLM is trained to reconstruct masked protein embeddings using the whole proteomic context. It thus learns contextualized protein representations reflecting proteome-scale functional constraints. We show that ProteomeLM spontaneously captures protein-protein interactions (PPI) in its attention coefficients. We demonstrate that it screens whole interactomes orders of magnitude faster than amino-acid coevolution-based methods, and substantially outperforms them. We further develop ProteomeLM-PPI, a supervised PPI prediction network that combines ProteomeLM embeddings and attention coefficients, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across species and benchmarks. Finally, we introduce ProteomeLM-Ess, a supervised predictor of gene essentiality that generalizes across diverse taxa.

V.; Leese, F.; Mayer, C.", "abstract": "Background: RNA-sequencing has greatly improved our understanding of the transcriptomic regulation of fundamental biological processes. Although the method has matured significantly within the last decade, bioinformatic processing of the resulting high-dimensional data sets is still challenging and the performance of algorithms can vary between data sets. As a consequence, for most non-model organisms, in particular arthropods, there is no or limited literature evidence which software is best suited to handle taxon-specific data characteristics. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of different de nonvo transcriptome assembler (Trinity, rnaSPAdes, IDBA-tran) and transcript quantification software (RSEM, Salmon) on transcriptomic data of a non-model insect and freshwater crustacean species, as well as the impact of different quality trimming strategies on the downstream bioinformatic processing results. Results: While the trimming strategy had no considerable effect on the quality of transcriptome assemblies, the choice of the assembler had a substantial impact. IDBA-tran was less sensitive than the two other assemblers and produced the most fragmented transcriptome assemblies. The low remapping rates of reads against IDBA-tran assemblies further suggest that the input read data was not effectively leveraged by this algorithm. In contrast, Trinity and rnaSPAdes both generated comprehensive and contiguous de novo transcriptome assemblies, although Trinity appeared to be slightly more sensitive. This increased sensitivity, however, was associated with a higher redundancy in Trinity-generated assemblies compared to assemblies produced with rnaSPAdes. When the quality of the transcriptome assembly was high, RSEM and Salmon were able to identify the origin of at least 90% of the read data in the reference. Despite their different underlying quantification approaches, the estimated transcript counts of both tools were highly correlated and their expression signal was consistent. Notably, the alignment-free quantification algorithm Salmon was substantially faster than the alignment-based approach of RSEM. Furthermore, it was also slightly more sensitive, increasing the average re-mapping rate to ~98%. Conclusion: Since the performance of bioinformatic algorithms, especially of de novo assemblers, varies for different RNA-sequencing data sets, establishing an appropriate analysis workflow remains an important task. Our results show that the better performing combinations of algorithms produce congruent count data sets with consistent expression signal, highlighting the robustness of RNA-sequencing data analysis software.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The application of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) often relies on proxy estimates of cortical excitability (CE), such as the resting motor threshold (rMT), measured through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, estimating the rMT is not always possible, as it requires an intact corticospinal pathway for neural signals to travel from the cortex to the periphery. To broaden the application of NIBS there is a need for additional CE measures. In three experiments combining TMS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and eye-tracking, we measured TMS-induced pupil dilations as a potential CE proxy. We present Bayesian evidence (Experiment 1: BF > 9; Experiment 2: BF > 46; Experiment 3: BFs > 6) that TMS-induced pupil dilations serve as an objective CE proxy, with larger pupil size reflecting higher CE. We also show that these effects are not due to auditory, muscle, or sensory confounds. The introduction of this novel measure paves the way for a deeper understanding of CE by enabling objective NIBS measures beyond the motor cortex. Moving away from the reliance on the motor cortex would allow NIBS research and therapy to become more inclusive, allowing access to populations that are affected by damage along the corticospinal pathway.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

We present the first population genomic study of the endangered scaly-foot snail (Chrysomallon squamiferum), an iconic species distributed across three vent biogeographic provinces. Analysing 125 individuals from eight vent fields using 14 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify five genetic groups that warrant recognition as evolutionarily significant units. Demographic modelling reveals critical contributions from extinct or unsampled 'phantom populations' to the contemporary genetic structure. Together with physical ocean modelling, we show that the deep currents drive asymmetric south-to-north gene flows, while transform faults act as dispersal barriers. We propose Longqi-Duanqiao fields on the Southwest Indian Ridge and Wocan field on the Carlsberg Ridge as two isolated populations prioritised for protection. Given its exceptional adaptations, wide distribution, and public recognition, the scaly-foot snail is well-positioned to serve as both a flagship and umbrella species to ensure the survival of a broader suite of vent biodiversity.

R.; Fahrunnida, F.; Robert, C.; Retnoaji, B.; Alam, C.

We use high speed videography to deduce the velocities of recoil motion in both bending (B) and torsion (T), in downstroke and upstroke modes of flapping. Elastic recoil is faster in downstroke (DS) than it is in upstroke (US), reaching average velocities, [v], 244 {degrees} {middle dot} s-1 in DS-B vs 6434 {degrees} {middle dot} s-1 in US-B, and 5887 {degrees} {middle dot} s-1 in DS-T vs 4545 {degrees} {middle dot} s-1 in US-T. Our results also therefore evidence that bending velocities during elastic recoil, are higher to the velocities in torsion, and conclude that this is a result of the necessary geometrical distances that need to be covered over a stroke. The wings do not act alone as biological springs, but rather, we find that the stiffnesses of the wings (1.7-3.6 GPa) are higher when attached to the cicada body, than they are when detached. This evidences thoracical involvement as part of the biological spring enabling elastic recoil, indicating that elastic recoil of flapping wings should be approached from a systems perspective, rather than solely through a localised understanding of wing mechanics.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

While its relevance in adulthood has been extensively explored, less is known about how these abilities develop during adolescence, a period characterised by significant physical and psychological changes. This study aimed to investigate three distinct dimensions of interoception -- accuracy, sensitivity and awareness -- in adolescents and adults to better understand the developmental profile of this sense. Fifty-four adolescents (aged 12-14) and 50 adults (aged 25-34) completed the Heartbeat Monitoring Task to assess their actual ability to detect heartbeats, their confidence in this ability, and the confidence-accuracy correspondence, and a questionnaire on the tendency to focus on bodily sensations. The study also examined where participants localised bodily sensations during the interoceptive task. The results revealed no significant differences in interoceptive accuracy between the two groups. Both age groups exhibited similar body localisation patterns, primarily focusing on the chest during heartbeat detection. However, adolescents showed significantly lower metacognitive awareness of their ability to perceive internal bodily sensations, and higher focus on interoceptive sensations, as reflected in their higher confidence ratings and questionnaire scores. No significant correlations emerged among the three interoceptive dimensions in either group, which supports the view that these dimensions represent independent components of interoception. These findings suggest that, while basic interoceptive detection may be established by early adolescence, the capacity to accurately reflect on these internal sensations continues to mature into adulthood. The mismatch observed between adolescents' heightened bodily focus and their limited metacognitive insight may partly help explain why adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to mental health difficulties.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Network-level effects were more likely when stimulating sites in white matter, in close proximity to the targeted network, and within a region predominantly occupied by the targeted network.

We investigated this question in Drosophila acentrosomal salivary glands (SGs), a physiological polyploid model where cells reach high chromosome content through endoreplication. Using genetic tools, live imaging approaches, super-resolution microscopy combined with tissue clearing and electron microscopy, our study uncovers a novel centrosome elimination pathway in vivo. This process requires non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) activity and the macroautophagic machinery to drive centrosome release into the lumen of the salivary glands via autolysosomal exocytosis. Failure to eliminate centrosomes disrupts the mitochondria network, impairing respiration and ATP production. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism that removes centrosomes through the secretory autophagy pathway to protect mitochondrial function and support the high metabolic demands of polyploid cells.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

A.; Worbs, T.; Thielscher, A.; Grill, W. M.; Peterchev, A.

A recent study proposed a statistical method to account for the influence of microscopic perturbations to the E-field. The method, however, relies on the unsubstantiated assumption that thresholds can be predicted by single pointwise samples of the E-field strength along neural cables. Objective: We analyzed neural responses to E-field with microscopic perturbations and demonstrate via theoretical derivation and simulations that neural activation is not determined by pointwise E-field amplitude but rather by spatial integration of the E-field along the neural cable. Therefore, the influence of microscopic E-field perturbations is negligible due to the spatiotemporal filtering by the neural membrane and axoplasm. Methods: We derive the axial and transmembrane currents in a neural cable for an imposed E-field with microscopic perturbations. We simulate neural activation thresholds of unmyelinated and myelinated axons in two stimulation scenarios and compare thresholds for E-field activation with and without perturbations. Results: In the theoretical derivation, the perturbation terms average out to zero on larger spatial scales indicating that they do not influence neural activation thresholds. Simulated thresholds with the E-field spatial perturbations present had negligible differences (< 3.4%) compared to those without. Conclusion: Single point samples of the microscopic E-field on a neural cable cannot predict neural activation thresholds. Neural simulations should be used to determine any influence of the E-field spatial perturbations. The latter, however, are unlikely to account for the difference between experimental and simulated E-field thresholds.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

HB research has been hampered by a paucity of established cell lines, particularly those bearing these mo-lecular drivers. All combinations of B, Y and N (i.e. BY, BN, YN and BYN) are tumorigenic when over-expressed in murine livers but it has not been possible to establish cell lines from primary tumors. Recently, we found that concurrent Crispr-mediate targeting of the Cdkn2a tumor suppressor locus allows for such immortalized cell lines to be generated with high fidelity. Methods: We generated 5 immortalized cell lines from primary Cdkn2a-targeted BN and YN HBs and characterized their properties. Notably, 4 of the 5 retain their ability to grow as subcutaneous or pulmonary tumors in the im-mune-competent mice from which they originated. Most notably, when maintained under hypoxia conditions for as little as 2 days, BN cells reversibly up-regulated the expression of numerous endothelial cell (EC)-specific genes and acquired EC-like properties that ben-efited tumor growth. Conclusions: The above approach is currently the only means by which HB cell lines with pre-selected, clinically relevant oncogenic drivers can be gener-ated and the only ones that can be studied in immune-competent mice. Its generic nature should allow HB cell lines with other oncogenic drivers to be derived. A collection of such cell lines will be useful for studying tumor cell-EC trans-differentiation, interactions with the immune environment and drug sensitivities.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

This study presents the first integrative analysis of how recurrent drought (D2), drought memory (D1), and methyl jasmonate-induced memory (M1) independently and interactively shape metabolomic diversity, composition, and morpho-physiological traits. Using Festuca rubra as a model species and using a full-factorial design, we found that current drought (D2) was the primary driver of metabolic reprogramming, reducing metabolite richness but enhancing uniqueness, suggesting a streamlined, stress-optimized strategy. D1 and M1 had significant, context-dependent impacts: D1 increased richness under well-watered conditions but reversed under drought, while M1 stabilized both metabolomic and trait variability. Importantly, D1 and M1 effects were non-additive, producing emergent biochemical states and morpho-physiology. A significant D1 x D2 x M1 interaction revealed complex integration of environmental and hormonal legacies. The metabolomic shifts closely aligned with traits such as specific leaf area and relative water content, indicating a coordinated adaptation at both metabolomic and morpho-physiological levels through memory-driven mechanisms. Our findings confirm that both drought and hormone induced memories are transgenerational and compositional, with synergistic roles in plant stress adaptation.

MOR dysfunction has been linked to several psychiatric and nociceptive disorders. Identifying the key brain regions mediating the behavioral consequences of disrupted MOR signaling can shed light on the role of the opioid system in mood and pain regulation. In this study, we administered methocinnamox (MCAM), a long-acting, pseudo-irreversible MOR antagonist, acutely or chronically to adult C57BL/6J mice. A comprehensive behavioral battery was used to assess affective, social, and pain behavior. A single MCAM administration (10 mg/kg, s.c.) did not alter baseline behavior, but blocked opioid-induced analgesia, suggesting that basal -opioid tone does not contribute to these behaviors. In contrast, chronic MCAM administration (10 mg/kg, s.c., 3x/week for 4 weeks) led to increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased sociability, as well as enhanced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Remarkably, selective knockout of habenular MORs in adult Oprm1fl/fl mice reproduced key features of the chronic MCAM phenotype, including anxiety-like behavior and mechanical hyperalgesia.

Vesiculoviruses offer potent oncolytic and immunogenic potential. However, leveraging their serological diversity for repeat dosing remains unexplored. We generated a library of chimeric vesiculovirus vectors incorporating glycoproteins from less well characterized vesiculovirus species. We evaluated vector replication, infectivity, interferon (IFN) responses, and oncolysis in vitro, alongside assessments of neutralization resistance using patient sera, monoclonal antibodies, and in silico structural modeling. In vivo studies assessed tumor delivery, immune activation, and therapeutic efficacy following intravenous administration. The vesiculovirus library exhibited broad tumor infectivity, distinct IFN-stimulatory profiles, and variable oncolytic activity. Neutralization assays and computational modeling identified serological distinctness across vectors, driven by hypervariable glycoprotein epitopes, enabling evasion of cross-neutralizing antibodies. Tumor delivery and anti-tumor immunity were preserved despite humoral barriers. Incorporating tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) further amplified anti-tumor responses, even in the context of anti-viral memory. Sequential administration of distinct vesiculovirus vectors induced robust immune activation and improved survival in a B16-OVA-IFNAR-/- model. Our findings establish a glycoprotein-diverse vesiculovirus platform capable of overcoming humoral immunity, enabling repeat intravenous dosing and sustained engagement of the tumor microenvironment.

Here, we show through cytological analysis of early meiotic events that there are several key differences in the genesis of apyrene sperm and eupyrene sperm. Specifically, apyrene spermatocytes fail to condense and pair their chromosomes during meiotic prophase I. In addition, telomeres do not attach to the nuclear envelope. Due to these differences, full-length synaptonemal complex does not form. RNA sequencing of both eupyrene- and apyrene-producing testes revealed distinct changes in transcriptional programs, including down-regulation of a myriad of meiotic genes and cell cycle checkpoint factors during apyrene meiosis. By comparing wild-type and Sxl-knockout apyrene testes, we found that Sxl is not required for the changes in the expression of the meiotic genes but instead plays a role in checkpoint inactivation to allow this error-prone meiosis to proceed. Together, our findings reveal significant insights into two converging molecular pathways that promote the formation of dimorphic sperm in Lepidoptera.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we collected and uniformly processed more than 300 human and mouse neuronal Hi-C datasets and examined chromatin features ranging from chromatin compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) to chromatin loops, Polycomb-mediated contacts, and frequently interacting regions (FIREs). We found that iPSC-derived neurons largely retain chromatin state of undifferentiated cells and resemble fetal rather than mature neurons. iPSC-derived neurons exhibit unusually strong compartmentalization, an enrichment of developmental genes at TAD borders, and a marked reduction of long-range repressive Polycomb-mediated contacts that typically silence early fetal programs. Conversely, these cells robustly capture contacts involving GWAS SNPs relevant to neurological diseases. Thus, while iPSC-derived neurons may not fully replicate 3D genome architecture of adult neurons, they effectively model interactions linking disease-associated SNPs to target genes.

C.; Luque, A.", "abstract": "While the majority of viruses falls within a handful of well-defined realms, many novel viruses and virus-like genetic elements remain to be discovered. Given the abundance and diversity of small, circular DNA genomes in animal gut viromes, we hypothesized that viruses of similar size might have been overlooked in other environments. Re-analyzing existing ocean virome datasets for small viruses, we discover a novel group of circular mobile genetic elements of ~4.6kb in size, likely with double-stranded DNA, which we term Charybdis elements. Charybdis elements form a singular group based on cohesive gene content, encode around 10 hypothetical genes but apparently contain no virus, transposon or plasmid associated hallmark proteins. They are detected exclusively in marine datasets ranging from surface water to hydrothermal vents and sediments, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Virome datasets separating virus-like particles by density gradients show that Charybdis elements accumulate in the fraction representing extracellular vesicles and small, tail-less viruses that are often associated with lipid membranes. One specific clade of Charybdis elements is shown to integrate into the genomes of the common marine group II archaeon candidate order Poseidoniales, the putative host of these elements. Analysis of thousands genomes shows a common genome architecture consisting of two modules: An accessory module containing a diverse range methyltransferases and other genes likely involved in host interactions, and a more conserved (putative) structural module. The structural module encodes proteins that are confidently predicted to form striking tri- or pentameric structures. These structures show stark resemblance and in some cases homology to protrusion or tail-elements on the capsids of viruses from the realms Varidnaviria and Duplodnaviria. Given these traits, Charybdis elements likely represent a hitherto undiscovered group of virus or virus-satellites, with at least one protein of a novel double-Greek-key fold serving as a potential capsid element. However, since their hosts remain unculturable, the true nature of these ubiquitous marine elements remains as of yet unresolvable.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

A subset of intoxicated mice had blood collected on days 1 and 4 for blood ethanol concentration analysis, confirming heavy intoxication (~289 mg/dL). At 9 weeks of age, animals were tested in the Light-Dark Box (LDB) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) immediately after receiving either 1.2 g/kg ethanol or saline. In the LDB, adolescent ethanol intoxication led to increased latency to enter the light compartment, although pre-test ethanol did not affect anxiety-like behaviors. Intoxicated females showed enhanced exploratory activity and males had reduced risk assessment behaviors. In the EPM, the effects of pre-test ethanol were more pronounced than adolescence intoxication, producing an anxiolytic effect accompanied by increased exploration and a reduction in risk assessment behaviors. Finally, a separate cohort was tested for ethanol drinking using a two-bottle choice Intermittent Overnight Drinking (IOD) protocol in adulthood.

However, it remains unclear how these differences manifest in wild primates, particularly among vervet monkeys. To address this, we employed a novel experimental co-feeding paradigm adapted for field conditions, presenting a fake grass carpet with a fixed density of corn and a plot area proportional to group size to measure group-level co-feeding tolerance. The study was conducted with two habituated groups of wild vervet monkeys at the iNkawu Vervet Project in South Africa.

Egalitarian is an adaptor protein that binds localization signals in specific RNAs in Drosophila and recruits them to the dynein-dynactin complex for microtubule-based transport. We determined the crystal structure of Egalitarian in complex with the localization signal of the K10 mRNA. Three structural units of Egalitarian, a 3'-5'exonuclease domain, a linker and a C-terminal domain form shape-specific, base-directed and backbone interactions with the RNA. Based on the structure we identified conserved residues recognizing RNA in vitro. Genome-edited flies with mutations in these residues have deficits in Egalitarian function that are congruent with changes in in vitro RNA binding affinities.

Previous studies showed that ICL2 is allosterically regulated by acetyl-CoA and its analogues but the molecular mechanism underpinning this regulation is unknown. Here, we use protein NMR, crystallography, molecular dynamics, and mutagenesis studies to show that two unique structural features of ICL2, its C-terminal domain and a unique helical substructure on its N-terminal catalytic domain, play important roles in its allostery. In particular, we found that the binding of acetyl-CoA promotes the dimerisation of the C-terminal domain and disrupts its interactions with the unique helical substructure on the N-terminal domain. This leads to conformational changes in the ICL2 enzyme that induces activation. Taken together, our findings reveal, for the first time, how the binding of acetyl-CoA, which is not an ICL2 substrate, induces ICL2 activation. By extension, the work also identifies a novel allosteric mechanism controlling M. tuberculosis metabolism that is amenable to therapeutic manipulation.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

M.; Zhang, J.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a systems-level disorder driven by the failure of interconnected biological networks, demanding therapeutic strategies and analytical frameworks that operate beyond single-target paradigms. The multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib is a promising therapeutic candidate due to its senolytic properties and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, its precise systems-level impact on AD-relevant gene networks remains unresolved. Here, we employ the GeneTerrain-GMM (gtGMM) framework, a novel method combining topological data analysis with unsupervised clustering, to dissect the mechanism of dasatinib in a human SH-SY5Y neuronal model. By analyzing high-throughput gene expression data from a curated network of 100 AD-implicated genes, we demonstrate that dasatinib, unlike an inert control, induces a profound, global reorganization of the gene expression landscape. This response is characterized by a smooth, highly coordinated topography, which gtGMM decomposes into a dominant, statistically robust functional module. Strikingly, this single module integrates canonical AD pathways with distinct signatures of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and ferroptosis, a convergence that provides a powerful mechanistic fingerprint of the drug's action. Our findings reveal that dasatinib's effect is not diffuse but is focused on a critical nexus linking protein misprocessing to inflammation and programmed cell death.

Although models that use multiple sequence alignments (MSA), such as MSA Transformer, offer parameter-efficient alternatives by extracting evolutionary information directly from homologous sequences rather than storing it in parameters, they generally underperform compared to single-sequence-based language due to memory inefficiencies that limit the number of sequences and averaging evolutionary signals across the MSA. We address these challenges with MSA Pairformer, a 111M parameter memory-efficient MSA-based protein language model that extracts evolutionary signals most relevant to a query sequence through bi-directional updates of sequence and pairwise representations. MSA Pairformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised contact prediction, outperforming ESM2-15B by 6% points while using two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. In predicting contacts at protein-protein interfaces, MSA Pairformer substantially outperforms all methods with a 24% point increase over MSA Transformer. Unlike single-sequence models that deteriorate in variant effect prediction as they scale, MSA Pairformer maintains strong performance in both tasks. Ablation studies reveal triangle operations remove indirect correlations, and unlike MSA Transformer, MSA Pairformer does not hallucinate contacts after removing covariance, enabling reliable screening of interacting sequence pairs.

We show here that Munc13-1-mediated priming of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at active zones controls hMF STF and PTP in response to Ca2+-phospholipid and Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) signaling. Knock-in mice expressing Munc13-1 variants that are insensitive to Ca2+-phospholipid and Ca2+-CaM signaling exhibit severely impaired STF and PTP at hMF synapses. Moreover, the PTP-induction threshold is strongly increased upon the loss of Ca2+-phospholipid-Munc13-1 signaling. Since these synaptic defects are accompanied by working memory deficits, especially in mice expressing the Ca2+-phospholipid-insensitive Munc13-1 variant, we conclude that Ca2+-dependent regulation of Munc13-1-mediated SV priming co-determines hMF short-term plasticity and working memory formation.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

The function of around half of low threshold mechanoreceptors is dependent on the presence of the mechanically gated ion channel PIEZO2.

Here we re-examined this question by making a quantitative study of mechanically-gated currents activated by substrate deflection in sensory neurons lacking PIEZO2. We characterized mechanically-gated currents from embryonic and post-natal sensory neurons, taken from global Piezo2-/- or Piezo2 conditional knockouts (Piezo2cko), respectively. Surprisingly in both models, Piezo2 gene deletion was not associated with any significant reduction in the sensitivity or incidence of mechanosensitive currents compared to wild type controls. There was, however, a moderate reduction in the incidence of RA-currents with very fast activation and inactivation kinetics in both embryonic Piezo2-/- and juvenile Piezo2cKO mice. These results show that PIEZO2 channels are not the only mechanosensitive channels mediating RA-currents in sensory neurons. Furthermore, our data suggest that the phenotypes associated with Piezo2 loss of function alleles may sometimes be due to secondary effects of gene deletion, for example, by changing the developmental trajectory of sensory neurons.

Neuroinflammation contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease, with several microglial activation genes linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease, affects both microglial activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell-type independently contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. Conditioned media from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial conditioned media driving higher neuronal firing rates than APOE3 conditioned media. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network activity in response to conditioned media treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase presynaptic puncta with APOE4 microglial conditioned media. Conditioned media-derived exosomes from LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Lastly, increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet metabolism and blocking lipid droplet metabolism abolishes network activity.

However, for species whose adaptive potential is compromised due to ongoing threats, like disease, the outcome of such management interventions becomes more complex. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is a prime example, where the emergence of Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) has led to significant population declines, raising concerns about their long-term survival. It is therefore critical to understand if the introduction of new functional genetic variants through supplementation actions enhances, or potentially hinders, their long-term persistence. We investigated changes in functional gene diversity at both the population- and individual-levels, pre and post supplementation, across multiple wild devil sites (four supplemented and four not supplemented). We found that functional diversity increased post supplementation. Though the magnitude of change was varied among sites, a similar site-specific pattern was also evident in genome-wide diversity. Importantly, we saw no evidence of swamping of local alleles or those putatively associated with DFTD regressions. This is likely due to the source population representing the broad wild genetic diversity and supplementations facilitating gene flow across the current fragmented landscape. Continued and long-term monitoring at multiple wild sites will be necessary to determine whether future generations retain this introduced genetic variation.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Using quantitative in vitro reconstitution with supported lipid bilayers and fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that the BRAF CRD exhibits high intrinsic affinity for phosphatidylserine-rich membranes, but the inclusion of the BSR markedly reduces the membrane binding. We further demonstrate that the inhibitory function of the BSR correlates with its global electrostatic properties rather than a single defined sequence motif. This inhibitory effect of BSR was corroborated in live cells by quantifying plasma membrane localization of BRAF constructs, including the full-length protein. When canonical autoinhibition of CRD-- mediated by sequestration within the 14-3-3 dimer--is disrupted by oncogenic mutation or RAF inhibitor treatment, the BSR assumes a compensatory role in repressing CRD--lipid interaction. This additional regulatory layer provided by the BSR prevents RAS-independent membrane recruitment under both physiological and pathological conditions.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

We obtain highly specific dye-binding proteins with low nanomolar affinities for the intended target; a crystal structure of one binder confirms close resemblance to the design model. Simultaneous labeling of mammalian cells expressing three dye-specific binders at different subcellular compartments demonstrates the utility in multiplex imaging. We further expand the functionality of the binder by incorporating an active site that carries out nucleophilic aromatic substitution to form a covalent linkage with the dye, and develop split versions which reconstitute fluorescence at subcellular locations where both halves are present towards monitoring in-cell protein interactions and chemically induced dimerization.

However, most superresolution methods are ill-adapted for live-sample imaging because they are unacceptably slow, susceptible to artifacts, or require the use of specialized fluorophores and labeling protocols. We introduce a superresolution method called centroid reassignment microscopy (CRM) that overcomes these limitations. CRM is a simple variation on confocal microscopy wherein the single-element detector and small pinhole are replaced by a centroid detector and larger pinhole. Superresolution is obtained by reassigning the centroid location of the detected fluorescence as a function of the scanning excitation focus location. Our method bears resemblance to the method of image scanning microscopy, which involves the use of an array detector, with the advantage that CRM provides improved resolution for the same number of detected photons while being simpler to implement. CRM is light-efficient, fast (single frame), robust to defocus aberrations, and requires no changes whatsoever in standard fluorescence imaging protocols, making it uniquely attractive for superresolution imaging of live, dynamic samples.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we combine genetic and pharmacological approaches to demonstrate that CDK11 is a critical regulator of cancer cell survival that is required for RNA splicing and the expression of homologous recombination genes. Inhibition of CDK11 disrupts genome stability, promotes the retention of intronic sequences in mature mRNAs, and induces synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors. Through integrative analysis of functional genomics datasets, we identify heterozygous deletions of chromosome 1p36 - which encompasses CDK11 and its activating cyclin CCNL2 - as a recurrent and predictive biomarker of sensitivity to CDK11 inhibition. To assess the therapeutic potential of CDK11, we develop MEL-495R, a selective and orally bioavailable CDK11 inhibitor. Additionally, we establish a genetically-engineered mouse model that allows us to differentiate between the on-target and off-target effects of CDK11 inhibitors in vivo. Using this platform, we demonstrate that MEL-495R induces widespread on-target toxicity, revealing a narrow therapeutic index. Together, these findings define CDK11 as a core cancer dependency, uncover a chromosomal deletion that sensitizes tumors to CDK11 inhibition, and provide a generalizable strategy for deconvolving drug efficacy and toxicity in vivo for novel oncology targets.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Although extensive literature has proposed that alpha oscillations (7-14 Hz) suppress distractor processing, recent studies have questioned this role. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we used a modified Stroop task to investigate whether (1) alpha oscillations are associated with functional inhibition in higher-order visual regions and the ventral attention network (VAN), and (2) alpha phase adjusts in anticipation of relevant and irrelevant stimuli. We found no significant increase in pre-stimulus alpha power or phase adjustment over higher-order visual regions in the attend-color condition, consistent with the absence of a behavioral Stroop effect. However, we observed elevated alpha-beta power (10-20 Hz) in the VAN during both attend-color and attend-word conditions compared to control conditions, occurring before stimulus onset. Higher alpha-beta power in the right temporo-parietal junction correlated with faster reaction times, suggesting that inhibition of this network region facilitates task performance. This alpha-beta modulation in the VAN may represent a general mechanism for resisting distraction, preventing attentional capture by irrelevant information regardless of task condition. Additionally, we found enhanced theta power (4 Hz) over the VAN and left medial frontal gyrus (part of the cognitive control network) in both experimental conditions. Theta power correlated with improved reaction times across these regions. Furthermore, theta activity in the left medial frontal gyrus synchronized with VAN nodes, potentially indicating cross-network interaction between cognitive control and attention systems.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

This study recorded nighttime polysomnography in patients with UWS, patients with minimally conscious state (MCS) and healthy controls, showing that spectral slope could index arousal, fluctuating among sleep stages in all three groups. Both spectral entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity can index awareness, showing a significant difference between conscious and unconscious states.

We analyzed over 45 million nights of sensor data from 105,741 German adults wearing consumer-grade wearables across 2.7 years. Sleep timing displayed a continuous east-west gradient, with later onset, midsleep, and offset in western regions, consistent with solar progression. This effect was strongest on weekends and in rural areas, where midsleep was delayed by 2.2 minutes per degree longitude and sleep duration increased by 1.0 minute. A north-south gradient also emerged. Weekday midsleep advanced by 0.9 minutes per degree latitude, while weekend midsleep was delayed by 0.2 minutes, resulting in greater social jetlag in the north. Sleep duration declined toward higher latitudes across both day types. Seasonal analyses revealed consistent annual rhythms. Sleep duration increased by 24.7 minutes in winter relative to summer, and sleep offset closely followed sunrise. These patterns highlight the joint influence of solar and social time on sleep, with implications for regionally tailored public health strategies.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

However, these systems do not afford the neat phase diagrams and exquisite control available in condensed matter physics. How can one assess proximity to criticality when control parameters are unknown, difficult to manipulate experimentally, and fluctuating in response to changing environmental or internal conditions? Here we meet this challenge with a rigorous theoretical framework and data-analytic strategy for measuring proximity to criticality from observed system dynamics. We developed a temporal RG, well-suited to commonly measured time series, and an information theoretic quantification of proximity to criticality that is independent of model parameterization. After benchmarking our approach on diverse ground-truth cases, we apply it to recordings of spiking activity in the mammalian brain, addressing a long-standing controversy. We show that brain dynamics shift closer to criticality during wakefulness and shift away during deep sleep.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

Genomic analysis revealed genes related to phosphorus solubilization and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis. In vitro assays confirmed its ability to solubilize tricalcium phosphate and produce gluconic acid. IAA production was higher under microaerobic conditions compared to aerobic cultures. Using Arabidopsis thaliana DII-VENUS reporter lines, we confirmed in vivo IAA perception in roots, with reduced VENUS fluorescence upon bacterial inoculation, regardless of prior oxygen conditions. Confocal microscopy showed root surface colonization and internal localization in cotyledons, including sub-stomatal spaces. Morphological changes in A. thaliana included reduced primary root length and increased root hair length. In wheat, P. extremaustralis exhibited chemotaxis toward root exudates and colonized root tissues. After 30 days in pot experiments, inoculated wheat plants showed significantly higher stem dry weight and leaf phosphorus content than control plants. These findings indicate that P. extremaustralis promotes plant growth through multiple mechanisms, supporting its potential as a bioinoculant under variable environmental conditions, including low oxygen availability.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

I.; Gaona, O.; Garcia, A. E.; G-Santoyo, I.", "abstract": "Gut microbiota composition is shaped by environmental factors such as lifestyle, diet, socioeconomic and cultural context, as well as host-related factors like age and sex. Although microbiota research has expanded rapidly in recent years, most current paradigms are based on data from individuals in high-income, industrialized countries, particularly in Europe and North America. As a result, microbiota profiles from non-Westernized populations--especially those from Indigenous communities--remain underrepresented in global studies, limiting our understanding of the full ecological and evolutionary diversity of human gut microbial communities. In this study, we characterized the bacterial gut microbiota of Mephaa individuals, a pre-Columbian Indigenous group from the south-central region of Mexico. This rural community maintains a subsistence lifestyle centered on high-fiber, plant-based diets and limited exposure to industrialized foods. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed microbial profiles from 62 individuals aged 5 to 60 years, examining differences across age and sex to explore patterns of diversity and community structure. Despite sharing similar life conditions, noticeable differences in gut microbiota were observed; alpha and beta diversities revealed significant variation across age and sex. Children exhibited greater microbial richness and inter-individual variability, consistent with dynamic colonization processes that begin in early life. In contrast, adults showed more taxonomically uniform communities, with a higher abundance of taxa such as Prevotellaceae, Succinivibrio, and Dialister, which are associated with fiber fermentation and complex carbohydrate metabolism. Additionally, sex-related differences were evident, with adult males displaying the highest relative abundance of Prevotellaceae. Finally, the presence of taxonomic groups rarely observed in urban Western populations suggests that indigenous lifestyles may preserve microbial diversity with potential metabolic relevance. Our findings advance the ecological and evolutionary understanding of human gut microbiota and highlight the importance of integrating non-Westernized populations into microbiome research to better elucidate host-microbe coadaptation and its implications for health.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Transcription factors are among the most challenging targets for drug discovery due to their lack of classical binding pockets and high degree of intrinsic disorder, despite the therapeutic importance of many of these proteins. IRF5 and IRF8 are key transcriptional regulators of innate immune signaling that orchestrate pro-inflammatory gene expression programs in response to stimuli such as toll-like receptor activation, making them central players in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Despite their therapeutic interest, direct targeting of IRF5 and IRF8 has remained challenging. Here, we screened a library of cysteine-reactive covalent ligands to identify hits that could degrade IRF5. We identified acrylamide EN1033 as the top hit, which not only led to IRF5 loss in a proteasome-dependent manner but also bound directly and covalently to the IRF5 protein, inhibiting IRF5-specific transcriptional activity in a macrophage cell line. Upon further analysis, however, we found that EN1033 not only engaged and degraded IRF5 but also more robustly engaged and degraded a related inflammatory transcription factor, IRF8, more rapidly. We further demonstrated that EN1033 destabilized and degraded IRF5 and IRF8 by covalently targeting C28 and C223, respectively, as evidenced by the attenuation of their degradation through mutagenesis of these cysteines. We also found that IRF8 loss led to the downregulation and inhibition of IRF5 activity, suggesting a crosstalk between these two transcription factors, which are both targeted by EN1033. Overall, we identify an early-stage pathfinder molecule that covalently targets IRF8 and IRF5, thereby degrading these transcription factors and inhibiting their pro-inflammatory transcriptional activity.", "date": "2025-08-03", "journal": ""}

The novel pathways leverage oxidative deamination and decarboxylation reactions and efficiently channel metabolic flux toward malonyl-CoA, leading to increased triacetic acid lactone (TAL) production beyond the capability of the native acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
