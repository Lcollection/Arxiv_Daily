What is the spore survival, that one would expect upon analysing a self-cross, in a wild fission yeast strain? Could this two research questions be, somehow, related? In this manuscript, I am describing some interesting observations obtained while studying fission yeast spore survival values upon genetic crosses. Early findings brought my attention into mainly studying self-crosses (intra-strain crosses in which any cell can be involved in by matting with a sibling cell). This study, yield some interesting findings. As a summary: 1) most fission yeast self-crosses do show low spore survival values; 2) clonally related strains show a high phenotypic variability in self-cross spore survival values; 3) differences in self-cross spore survival values can be detected when comparing zygotic and azygotic mattings; 4) self-cross spore survival values are highly affected by environmental factors, mainly producing a reduction in the spore survival values; 5) self-cross spore survival values are recovered when cells are subjected to several rounds of meiotic divisions; 6) signs of correlation between spore survival and vegetative cell survival (prior to the entry into meiosis) have been observed in this study. All those observations, among others, are discussed as part of an epigenetic variability that exist in fission yeast populations. A cyclical behaviour, of this epigenetic variability it is proposed, defining an underlying ratchet-like epigenetic mechanisms acting in all cells. In this manuscript, I propose that this mechanism, is, indeed, the main cause of the ageing process.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, employing information-theoretic metrics, we quantified gesture and speech information, alongside their interaction, utilizing entropy and mutual information (MI). Neural activities were assessed via interruption effects induced by High-Definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). Additionally, chronometric double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-temporal event-related potentials were utilized to decipher dynamic neural changes resulting from various information contributors. Results showed gradual inhibition of both inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) as degree of gesture-speech integration, indexed by MI, increased. Moreover, a time-sensitive and staged progression of neural engagement was observed, evidenced by distinct correlations between neural activity patterns and entropy measures of speech and gesture, as well as MI, across early sensory and lexico-semantic processing stages. These findings illuminate the gradual nature of neural activity during multisensory gesture-speech semantic processing, shaped by dynamic gesture constraints and speech encoding, thereby offering insights into the neural mechanisms underlying multisensory language processing.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate how subjective, physiological, and behavioural indicators of arousal and attentional state vary in relation to ongoing cardiac activity and brain-heart coupling. Electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and pupillometric records were obtained from 65 adults during the performance of a sustained attention to response task (SART). Thought probes were intermittently administered during the SART to collect subjective reports of attentional state (i.e., on-task, mind-wandering, mind-blanking) and vigilance level (i.e., alertness vs. sleepiness). Mind-wandering and mind-blanking reports increased in frequency with time-on-task and were accompanied by decreases in alertness and pupil-linked arousal, but evinced distinct psychophysiological and behavioural profiles. While mind-wandering was associated with greater heart-rate variability and late modulation of the heartbeat-evoked potential, mind-blanking was characterised by greater decreases in heart-rate, pupil size, and brain-heart coupling. Lower heart-rate predicted decreased vigilance and pupil size, in addition to slower, less-biased responses; increased heart-rate variability predicted more impulsive behaviour and pupil dilation. Together, these findings reveal that cardiac and brain-heart connectivity measures afford complementary information about arousal states and attentional dynamics during task performance.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

As such, migraine involves integration of sensory, pain, cognitive, autonomic, and affect-related circuits. It is essential to understand how neural activity across various brain regions is coordinated during migraine pathophysiology. Using a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mouse model of migraine, we probed neural oscillatory activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala (AMY), thalamus (Po, VPM, and MDthal), and parabrachial nucleus (PBN) following peripheral administration of CGRP. We found that power across the network was lowered within 10 minutes of peripheral CGRP exposure, which was sustained for ~40-50 min. Coherence was mostly disrupted in amygdalar brain region pairings, and took on a shorter timecourse. Sumatriptan partially reversed these CGRP-induced network responses. Early life stress, which has been shown to increase the likelihood of migraine in adulthood in humans, exacerbated CGRP-induced migraine-related behavioral and network physiology phenotypes. Clustering based on a changepoint analysis of coherence identified individual mice hypersusceptible to migraine.

Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) often experience rapid amino acid sequence divergence, but because they do not fold into stable 3D structures, it remains unknown when and how function is conserved. As a model system for studying the evolution of IDRs, we examined transcriptional activation domains, the regions of transcription factors that bind to coactivator complexes. We systematically identified activation domains on 502 homologs of the transcriptional activator Gcn4 spanning 600 MY of fungal evolution in the Ascomycota. We find that the central activation domain shows strong conservation of function without conservation of sequence. We identify the molecular mechanism for this conservation of function without conservation of sequence: evolutionary turnover (gain and loss) of acidic and aromatic residues that are important for function. We further see turnover of complete N-terminal activation domains. This turnover at two length scales confounds multiple sequence alignments, explaining why traditional comparative genomics cannot detect functional conservation of activation domains. Evolutionary turnover of key residues is likely a general mechanism for conservation of function without conservation of sequence in IDRs.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we have characterized the functional diversity of VIP INs in the primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) using intersectional genetic approaches. We found that VIP INs are comprised of four primary populations that exhibit different laminar distributions, axonal and dendritic arbors, intrinsic electrophysiological properties, and efferent connectivity. Furthermore, we observe that these populations are differentially activated by long-range inputs, and display distinct responses to neuromodulation by endocannabinoids, acetylcholine and noradrenaline.

While these phenomena have been studied extensively with experiments and theory, the underlying principles for combining E and I inputs are still unclear. Here, rules for probabilistically combining E and I inputs are derived that describe how neurons in a feedforward inhibitory circuit respond to stimuli.

C.", "abstract": "Humans and other primates are capable of learning to recognize new visual stimuli throughout their lifetimes. Most theoretical models assume that such learning occurs through the adjustment of the large number of synaptic weights connecting the visual cortex to downstream decision-making areas. While this approach to learning can optimize performance on behavioral tasks, it can also be costly in terms of time and energy. An alternative hypothesis is that the brain favors simpler learning rules that do not necessarily optimize the readout of information from visual cortical neurons. Here we have examined these hypotheses by reversibly inactivating visual area V4 in non-human primates at different stages of training on shape discrimination tasks. We find that V4 inactivation generally has a behavioral effect for only a subset of the stimuli that are encoded in the V4 population activity, specifically those that can be represented efficiently in the population firing rate. As a result, there is little relationship between neural measures of discriminability and the causal contribution of V4 neurons to a particular task. This pattern of results can be explained by incorporating a strong inductive bias for simpler perceptual readouts into existing theoretical frameworks. Such a simplicity bias is suboptimal in the sense that it ignores information that could theoretically be extracted from the neural population, but it has the likely advantage of facilitating efficient learning on ecologically-relevant timescales.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Crucial work remains to domesticate and optimize pennycress for incorporation into cropping systems and increasing resilience to rising temperatures. We found that increased planting density reduces biomass and swiftens time to flowering and maturity, which are features associated with shade avoidance responses. In controlled conditions, we found that pennycress elongates in response to foliar shade and increased ambient temperatures (20 {ring}C to 28 {ring}C). We applied the knowledge base from Arabidopsis thaliana to manipulate genes in the PHYB signaling pathway to simultaneously decrease the shade avoidance response during interseeding and tissue responses to elevated temperatures. Evaluation of CRISPR alleles of PIF7 shows that pif7 reduces organ elongation to competition and heat cues and retains a compact rosette when exposed to shade or elevated temperature and their combination. Crucially, yield and oil content were unaltered in pif7 and plants maintained earlier flowering in stress conditions. Furthermore, indicators of plant health, such as hue, chlorophyll indices, and root system architecture were improved between wild type and pif7. This is evidence that plant architecture and physiological health can be uncoupled under competition and heat conditions, supporting our efforts to attenuate morphological responses to environmental cues. We propose this strategy to reduce SAR will improve pennycress performance at high densities, during interseeding establishment in standing crops, and in a warming climate.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we established a mouse reporter model for studying muscle cell contribution to bone fracture repair. Analyzing skeletal muscle scRNA-seq datasets revealed that Prg4 marks a fibro-adipogenic progenitor (FAP) subpopulation. In mice, Prg4+ cells were specifically located in the skeletal muscle, but not at the periosteum or inside cortical bone. These cells expressed FAP markers, responded to muscle injury, and became periosteal cells under normal and muscle injury conditions. Fracture fragmented muscle fibers, rapidly expanded Prg4+ FAPs at the injury site and promoted their migration into the fracture site. Later, they gave rise to many chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the outer periphery of callus next to muscle. In repaired bones, the descendants of Prg4+ FAPs were detected as mesenchymal progenitors in the periosteum and osteocytes at the prior fracture site. A second fracture activated those cells and stimulated them to become osteoblasts in the inner part of callus. Importantly, ablation of Prg4+ FAPs impaired fracture healing and functional repair. In an intramembranous bone injury model (drill-hole), Prg4+ FAPs became periosteal cells, but their contribution to bone defect repair was significantly less than in fractures.

In ferrets, as in primates, selectivity for motion direction is found both in early cortical stages like the primary visual cortex (V1) and in higher visual areas like primate MT and ferret PMLS.

Here, by studying the development of the ferret's motion pathway, we first reveal the surprising finding that direction selectivity develops earlier in PMLS than in V1, contrary to the areas' hierarchical positions. Our data furthermore show that while direction selectivity is sensitive to visual experience in both areas, the sensitivity profile differs between them: Moving stimuli, containing both spatial and temporal cues, are required to promote direction selectivity development in V1, but flashing stimuli that remain stationary spatially are sufficient for direction selectivity development in PMLS. Collectively, our findings reveal that the development of the motion pathway is highly complex when considered at the network level, and does not adhere to a simple feedforward model in which the development of lower visual areas sets the pace for higher ones. Not only will developmental models need to be updated to include this complexity, characterizing the link between the development of different visual areas will likely also be crucial for understanding the consequences of developmental disorders.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

However, emerging evidence highlights their implication in the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Nevertheless, isolating and studying the cellular mechanisms of PFs presents a significant challenge due to their intricate arborizing structure, heterogeneous cardiomyocytes (CMs) phenotype, and relatively small proportion within the ventricular mass, all of which hinder detailed functional investigations and comprehensive analysis of the conduction system network. OBJECTIVE: To develop a new methodology for dissociation and classification of cell populations related to the ventricular conduction system from adult sheep. This workflow establishes, in part, a proof-of-concept deep learning-based classification strategy that leverages standard cellular imaging data. METHODS: We developed a multi-tiered workflow to isolate and classify cardiac cell populations from adult sheep hearts. Coronary perfusion and enzymatic digestion were used to dissociate CMs from the left ventricular free wall (LVMs) and Purkinje-rich free-running false tendons (FTs). A three-pronged classification strategy was developed and implemented: (1) expert-guided visual phenotyping based on distinctive morphological traits; (2) rule-based morphometric quantification using automatic image analysis; and (3) deep learning-based classification with a retrained YOLOv9 model trained on augmented brightfield image datasets. This pipeline enabled accurate discrimination between LVM and FT-derived cells. Independent validation was performed using patch-clamp electrophysiology, T-tubule structure imaging with di-8-ANEPPS, and gene expression profiling (RT-qPCR) for Purkinje-specific biomarkers (Tbx5 and Cx40). RESULTS: During the qualitative inspection, FT-dissociated cells had distinct morphological features, including an elongated or slender shape, finger-like projections, curves and tortuous shapes, and a new feature: the presence of spurs along the lateral membrane. Subsequently, a YOLOv9 model achieved an accuracy of 98% in distinguishing LVM and FT cells, based on the initial visual selection made by the operator. In addition, FT-cells exhibit a lower organization and density of T-Tubules compared to LVM. This classification was confirmed by the characterization of the typically longer action potential (AP) durations in FT cells. Finally, higher mRNA expression of the transcription factor Tbx5 and connexin40 (Cx40) was observed in FTs compared to left ventricular tissues. CONCLUSIONS: We present a robust and scalable workflow for isolating and classifying cardiac Purkinje fiber cells from adult sheep, integrating manual phenotyping, rule-based morphometrics, and AI-driven deep learning. This multimodal approach enables high-accuracy identification of PF cells within heterogeneous tissue, confirmed through structural, molecular, and electrophysiological validation.

Non-additive responses to simultaneous activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways are one potential contributor. Here we explored mechanisms underlying the TLR2/MyD88 and TLR3/TRIF-mediated responses in macrophages for canonical pro-inflammatory and antiviral targets including TNF, IL-6, IL-12p40, IFN-{beta} and CXCL10. We found that all targets exhibited characteristic levels of synergistic cytokine activation that varied with TLR-ligand concentration and exposure time. These trends were conserved when the TLR3-ligand polyI:C (PIC) was combined with either of the TLR2-mediated pathogens S. aureus or L. pneumophila. Using pharmacological inhibitors, genetic knockouts, and recombinant cytokines, we explored how TLR2-TLR3-induced paracrine signaling via TNF and IFN-{beta} affected synergy. While TNF synergy is paracrine-independent, IFN-{beta} contributes to synergistic activation of IL-6 and IL-12p40. When IFN-{beta} was directly combined with P3C or S. aureus infection, low concentrations produced modest synergy for both, while high concentrations increased IL-6 but antagonized IL-12p40.

Whereas previous findings have shown elevated responses toward fungal antigens in individuals with IBD, e.g., elevated anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) levels, an exhaustive mapping of immune responses toward fungal antigens remains incomplete. Thus, we analyzed the fungal mycobiome profiled using internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)-sequencing simultaneously with the T cell repertoire of 637 individuals with IBD from the SPARC IBD cohort, which enabled us to identify 31 T cell clonotypes targeting several prevalent members of the gut mycobiome. Subsequently, we developed a novel phage-immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq) library covering 12,000 potential antigens from the proteome of S. cerevisiae and screened for antibody responses in 100 individuals with CD and 60 healthy controls with known ASCA status, enabling us to identify public and private antibody responses against several S. cerevisiae proteins. In conclusion, we corroborated previous findings showing elevated T cell responses against fungal antigens in individuals with IBD and identified multiple antigenic proteins from the proteome of S. cerevisiae that are targeted by the immune system of individuals with and without CD.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

The most prevalent of these is the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. The microbe infects between 40-60% of insect species, causes important reproductive manipulations, and limits virus replication in arthropod vectors, becoming a promising biocontrol agent. Understanding the molecular basis of Wolbachia infection and Wolbachia-induced phenotypes is critical to the use of Wolbachia in vector control. These Wolbachia ankyrin repeat proteins (WARPs) represent a highly dynamic and diverse part of the Wolbachia pangenome and remain thus far, largely uncharacterized. Here, we perform molecular and genetic screens to identify interactions between WolbachiawMel WARPs and their target host proteins in Drosophila melanogaster Our results identify strong interactions of two Wolbachia proteins, WARP434 and WARP754, with two host targets (CG11327 and Ptp61F, respectively). Heterologous expression of these two WARPs is extremely toxic in Drosophila tissues and the toxicity is dependent on the ankyrin repeat domain of each WARP. Importantly, knockdown of the host targets alleviates toxicity, confirming WARP/target interactions. Finally, antibodies targeting both WARPs show expression by Wolbachia during infection of Drosophila cells. Understanding how Wolbachia manipulates its host biology and which host pathways it targets during infection will help us divine how the most prevalent intracellular bacterial parasite on Earth interacts with its insect hosts at the molecular level. Our screen is the first step towards that goal.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Lung, liver, kidney, and heart samples were collected for microbiological and histopathological analyses. Bacterial isolation on blood agar showed the growth of spherical/ovoid colonies after 48 hours, consistent with the Photobacterium genus.

T.; Levesque, R. C.; Deziel, E.", "abstract": "The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for several acute and chronic infections. It produces a diverse array of virulence and survival determinants, many of which are tightly regulated by three interlinked quorum sensing (QS) systems named las, rhl and pqs. RhlR, the transcriptional regulator of the rhl system, activates multiple virulence genes upon binding to its cognate autoinducer signal. Meanwhile, the pqs system relies on 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) as signaling molecules to induce the transcriptional regulator MvfR (PqsR). MvfR then activates the transcription of the pqsABCDE operon, encoding enzymes for HAQ biosynthesis. The final gene in this operon encodes PqsE, a multifunctional protein unique to P. aeruginosa. Beyond its thioesterase activity in HAQ biosynthesis, PqsE stabilizes RhlR, facilitating its regulation of target genes, some of which are implicated in virulence. Because of its role in pathogenicity, PqsE is regarded as a promising therapeutic target for combating P. aeruginosa infections.\n\nWhile the role of PqsE towards the RhlR regulon is increasingly understood in prototypical P. aeruginosa strains such as PA14 and PAO1, its broader relevance as an anti-virulence target remains underexplored. Here, we confirm that PqsE is functionally relevant across a panel of twelve genetically diverse P. aeruginosa strains using metabolite quantification and phenotypic assays. Significant strain-to-strain variations further highlight the importance of studying QS regulation among diverse isolates. Moreover, this study underscores PqsE as a key QS regulator with a conserved role in coordinating virulence determinant production and social behaviors across diverse P. aeruginosa populations.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of TbAQP2 from Trypanosoma brucei, bound to either the substrate glycerol or to the sleeping sickness drugs, pentamidine or melarsoprol. The drugs bind within the AQP2 channel at a site completely overlapping that of glycerol. Mutations leading to a drug-resistant phenotype were found in the channel lining. Molecular dynamics simulations showed the channel can be traversed by pentamidine, with a low energy binding site at the centre of the channel, flanked by regions of high energy association at the extracellular and intracellular ends. Drug-resistant TbAQP2 mutants still bind pentamidine, but the much weaker binding in the centre of the channel is insufficient to compensate for the high energy processes of ingress and egress, hence impairing transport at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.

Our findings reveal that modest warming enhanced photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and night respiration, leaf anatomical traits as well as growth in Schima superba, Ormosia pinnata, and Pinus massoniana, of those species under warming. In contrast, Castanopsis hystrix demonstrated reduced performance in all measured traits because it may lack adaptive traits critical for warming resilience, indicating a divergent response to the same environmental condition.

Five species were previously known from other locations: C. briggsae, which was predominant, C. tropicalis, C. nigoni, C. brenneri and C. elegans. The five other species are new, and we describe them here as Caenorhabditis indonesiana, Caenorhabditis malino, Caenorhabditis ceno, Caenorhabditis brawijaya and Caenorhabditis ubi. RNA sequence analysis of 1,861 orthologous genes placed all species from Indonesia in the Elegans group of Caenorhabditis species. Four of the new species belong to a Sinica subclade of species so far only found in an East Asia-Indo-Pacific world region. The fifth new species, C. indonesiana, appears as the sister of the C. tropicalis-C. wallacei pair, both also found in Indonesia. The present findings are thus consistent with diversification in the Elegans group having occurred in this world region. Crosses between closely related species showed counterexamples to Haldane's \"rule\": for two pairs of species, in one cross direction we only found hybrid males.

Identifying the most similar barcode for each read is a theoretically attractive solution for barcode calling. However, an all-to-all exact similarity calculation is practically infeasible for applications with millions of barcodes and billions of reads. Hence, several computational approaches for barcode calling have been proposed, but the challenge of developing an efficient and precise computational approach remains.

Previous studies, however, suggest that the insula directly senses internal states, but the mechanisms remain elusive. We identified a novel population of glutamatergic leptin receptor-positive (LepR+) cells with a unique morphology in the insula (INSLepR). Based on leptin's known role in signaling adiposity levels, we hypothesized that INS-LepR neurons detect internal states and thus regulate food intake and body weight. Accordingly, we found that leptin administration in the insula increases intrinsic excitability of INSLepR cells, suppresses feeding, and reduces body weight. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of INSLepR cells suppresses learned operant feeding and leads to avoidance in a real time place preference context. We also found that INSLepR neurons encode operant feeding bouts, and their activity is modulated specifically by hunger, but not thirst, states. Single-nuclei sequencing and ribosome profiling revealed that INSLepR is expressed on both Layer 6 neurons and on vascular cells, suggesting that leptin can be delivered directly through receptor-mediated transport through the blood brain barrier into the insula. . INSLepR neurons form mainly local connections within the insula and an external projection to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals also regulated learned operant feeding. Moreover, we found that administration of leptin alters insula neural dynamics in response to feeding, but not drinking, behavior, and reshapes the transcriptome, suggesting that internal state information provided by leptin is used by the insula to coordinate feeding behavior. Taken together, our data supports a model for direct interoceptive input to the insula, in which INSLepR cells integrate adiposity level signals to regulate feeding and body weight in a learned manner.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

A separate group of participants (N = 421) rated the same images on nutritive properties (healthiness, calorie content, edibility, and level of transformation), hedonic properties (tastiness, willingness to eat, negative and positive valence, and arousal), and familiarity (previous exposure, recognisability, and typicality). Using representational similarity analysis, we quantified differences in patterns of multivariate EEG signals across foods and assessed whether the structure of these differences was correlated with differences in attribute ratings. We observed similar correlation time-courses for many attributes. There was an early window of correlations (~200 ms from image onset), followed by sustained windows of correlation from ~400-650 ms. Using principal components analysis, we identified a set of broader constructs that accounted for variance in ratings across multiple attributes, and also correlated with the EEG data. Our results indicate that food attributes important for choice are represented rapidly and in parallel, over similar time windows. Furthermore, we reveal that broad dimensions underlying individual attributes are also represented in the neural activity with distinct time-courses, indicating a multilevel structure of food attribute representations.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

The pan-PDE4 inhibitor crisaborole partially protected against hyperthermia-induced seizures and reduced spontaneous seizures in Scn1a+/- mice, while rolipram and roflumilast showed no efficacy at tolerable doses. SN-2000, a first-in-kind allosteric modulator of PDE4B, was rationally designed for isoform selectivity and brain penetration, and demonstrated versatile reduction of seizure activity across multiple zebrafish and rodent genetic and acquired epilepsy models, with efficacy comparable to standard-of-care ASMs. SN-2000 also demonstrated favorable behavioral outcomes, reducing post-ictal aggression and anxiety-like behaviors, and improving cognitive performance in both wild-type and epileptic mice. These effects were linked to paradoxical regulation of excitatory and neuronal activity in the cortex and thalamus of epileptic mice, respectively, as well as elevated cAMP signaling and downstream pCREB activation.

However, up to 60% of patients do not achieve a complete response. To uncover determinants of therapeutic efficacy, we analyzed the infusion products of eight r/r DLBCL patients with distinct clinical responses to axicabtagene ciloleucel using single-cell transcriptomics. Compared to patients who exhibited progressive disease, infusion products of complete responders demonstrated enriched signatures of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Based on these findings, we developed a novel strategy to improve CD19-directed CAR T-cell treatment efficacy by incorporating IFN-I as an enhancer during the ex vivo manufacturing process. For both CD28- and 4-1BB-costimulated second-generation CARs, we found that low-strength IFN-I signaling enhanced CAR T-cell cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy. On the other hand, high-strength IFN-I signaling compromised cell viability and in vivo efficacy. Our low-strength IFN-I signaling approach leverages an existing FDA-approved pharmacologic agent and is compatible with current CAR constructs and manufacturing workflows. Together, our results establish IFN-I as a potent and costimulation-independent enhancer of CAR T-cell efficacy and provide a translationally feasible approach to enhance CAR T-cell therapies for r/r DLBCL.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Although soil microbial communities are remarkably diverse and technological advances have provided a high capacity to acquire reliable sequence data, unique microbial taxa in soil, root and rhizosphere samples remain poorly described. For the first time, we organized a consortium to collect soil samples covering all Brazilian biomes, providing a comprehensive and unprecedented view of soil microbial diversity. This understanding is critical, especially within the context of climate change, which affects plant physiology, root exudation and, consequently, the composition and functionality of soil microbial communities. The interactions between soil, roots and rhizosphere are influenced by evolutionary and adaptive forces and shape the production of microbial natural products, which exhibit great therapeutic potential and Mapping and studying rhizosphere microbial biodiversity not only increases our knowledge of soil ecology but also offers valuable insights for developing sustainable practices. We employed both 16S/18S/ITS amplicon and metagenomic short-read shotgun sequencing methods to examine and catalogue the large-scale genomes of culture-independent rhizosphere microbes and their interactions with roots in six terrestrial Brazilian biomes, namely, the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, Caatinga, Pampa and Pantanal. Our results revealed the ubiquity of Proteobacteria, which reflects their adaptability to contrasting environments. Biomes with greater moisture availability, such as the Amazon and Pantanal, exhibited greater diversity and abundance of fast-growing bacteria, such as Proteobacteria, and nutrient cyclers, such as Thaumarchaeota. Arid and semiarid biomes, such as the Caatinga, were dominated by microorganisms tolerant to drought and nutrient-limited environments, such as Actinobacteria. Acidobacteria, which thrive in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, were very abundant in forest biomes. The Planctomycetes phylum also occurred more frequently in areas with a relatively high soil organic matter content, such as the Cerrado. Bacteroidetes was significantly more abundant in Pampa than in the other biomes. The results provide comprehensive insights into soil, root and rhizosphere biodiversity and not only enhance the knowledge of the fundamental biological processes sustaining plant life but also constitute a reliable sequencing databank to address present-day agricultural and environmental challenges.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

M.; Caballero Quiroga, I.; Singh, A.; Dennehy, J. J.", "abstract": "The timing of host cell lysis is a fundamental life history parameter in bacteriophages as it presents an evolutionary trade-off between maximizing intracellular phage replication and optimizing transmission to new host cells, ultimately determining viral fitness in dynamic bacterial populations. In the bacteriophage {lambda}, lysis time is dependent on the expression of a timekeeper protein, holin, which accumulates in the Escherichia coli inner membrane. Cell lysis is triggered when the membrane concentration of holin crosses a critical threshold level. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the rate of holin translation on lysis timing and its precision. We show that modulating holin translation efficiency through genetic modifications and antibiotic treatment alters bacteriophage lysis timing and its precision, providing insight into how phages optimize the evolutionary trade-off between replication and transmission. Reducing ribosomal binding affinity decreased holin expression and delayed lysis, while optimizing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence enhanced translation and accelerated lysis. Surprisingly, very low tetracycline concentrations may have improved translation efficiency and hastened lysis, whereas higher doses predictably delayed it. In all cases, longer lysis times corresponded with decreased timing variability. A model that incorporates stochastic gene expression with additional stochasticity in the initiation of holin expression was sufficient to explain the data. Thus, we demonstrated that modifying the rate of holin translation can be used as an evolutionary strategy to achieve optimum lysis timing.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Blending with synthetic polymers can aid ECM fabrication but often relies on digested ECM and encapsulation within the synthetic matrix can limit cell-ECM interactions. We recently developed a suspension electrospinning platform to facilitate ECM scaffold fabrication without the need for digestion or polymer-carriers. Its integration into a co-electrospinning system enables modular design of composite scaffolds to combine the regenerative potential of ECM with the advantages of synthetic polymers. This study directly compares co-electrospinning and blend electrospinning of polycaprolactone and small intestinal submucosa (SIS) for use as a bone wrap to augment membrane durability, sustain infection control, and enhance vascularity in Masquelet induced membrane technique. Co-spun wraps demonstrated improved handling properties as compared to ECM wraps and solvent welding was used to achieve target suture retention standards without diminishing SIS content. Unlike the blended wraps, the co-spun wraps supported full-thickness cell infiltration within 4 weeks, released gentamicin at a bactericidal concentration for 6 weeks, and demonstrated enhanced angiogenic properties.

To evaluate the GBM-modulatory potential of G28, we conducted comprehensive pharmacokinetic and 3D spheroid studies alongside established CHI3L1 modulators. G28 demonstrated outstanding bioavailability and low toxicity, addressing key limitations faced by previous CHI3L1-targeted strategies. Notably, in 3D GBM spheroid models, G28 significantly outperformed reported CHI3L1 small molecule modulators, showing the most pronounced dose-dependent reductions in spheroid weight, migration, and viability.

Research aimed at understanding the mechanism by which CR slows aging has focused heavily on insulin and downstream signaling cascades. Glucagon, a hormone that counter-regulates insulin, is commonly affected by these same interventions. To investigate the role of glucagon in aging we used dietary manipulation, global and liver- specific glucagon receptor knockout, and pharmacological glucagon receptor activation. We found that globally eliminating glucagon receptor signaling (Gcgr KO) decreases median lifespan by 35% in lean mice. These lifespan shortening effects are more robust in diet-induced obese mice (54%). Extending these findings to metabolic health, we found that glucagon receptor signaling is indispensable to the metabolic response to chronic CR in young and aged mice. While CR decreased liver fat, serum triglyceride, and serum cholesterol in WT mice, these metabolic benefits were absent in Gcgr KO mice. In line with these observations, we found that critical nutrient sensing pathways known to improve aging are dysregulated in mice lacking glucagon receptor signaling at the liver (Gcgrhep-/-). Liver-specific deletion of the glucagon receptor decreases hepatic AMP Kinase activation in aging mice, regardless of diet. Further, CR decreases hepatic mTOR activity in WT mice, but not in Gcgrhep-/- mice. Together, these findings propose that glucagon signaling plays a critical role in both normal aging and the lifespan and healthspan extension driven by caloric restriction.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

However, data on phosphorus remain limited, particularly for processed plant protein products. This pilot study aimed to compare phosphorus bioaccessibility of processed plant protein products with their animal protein counterparts, using in vitro simulation of adult human digestion. Methods: Soy protein (n=16), pulse protein (n=17), and animal protein (n=13) products representing food categories of beef, dairy, sausage/bacon, chicken/turkey were evaluated for phosphorus bioaccessibility using in vitro digestion based the INFOGEST protocol, followed by dialysis of the final digesta. Pre-digestion samples, final digesta, and final dialysate were analyzed for phosphorus content to calculate total and bioaccessible phosphorus and percent phosphorus bioaccessibility. Results: Average percent phosphorus bioaccessibility of all processed soy and pulse products studied ranged from 32-100%, while animal products ranged from 81-100%. Average bioaccessible phosphorus and bioaccessible phosphorus-to-protein ratio were lower for many soy and pulse protein beef and chicken/turkey alternatives, soy protein milk alternatives, and pulse protein sausage alternatives than their animal protein counter products. Conclusion: Some soy and pulse protein products offered lower bioaccessible phosphorus per 100g serving and per gram of protein than their animal protein counterparts. Thus, this pilot study suggests that certain processed plant protein products may be acceptable to include in a diet for phosphorus management in CKD.

Overcoming this barrier is critical for achieving effective recovery. Axonal regeneration depends on the activation of intracellular processes like transcription factor induction, protein and lipid trafficking, and cytoskeletal remodelling. Targeting these pathways offers a promising approach for promoting neuronal repair. This study examined the combined therapeutic effects of dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP), which primes neurons for growth, and integrin 9 overexpression, which supports axonal extension. Using in vitro models with dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and astrocytes, as well as an in vivo SCI model, we evaluated the potential of this approach. In vitro, the combination of db-cAMP and integrin 9 significantly enhanced neuronal growth. However, in vivo results were less consistent, with db-cAMP affecting AAV-mediated transcription and the expression of tenascin C (TnC) in neurons and astrocytes.

However, the use of CP is associated with peripheral neuropathy, a painful nerve disorder. Unfortunately, no therapies are available for CP-induced peripheral neuropathy (CisIPN). This study explored the role of a cytokine, the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), as a potential therapeutic target for CisIPN. Methods: The role of neuroinflammation and MIF in CisIPN was evaluated in mice models of CisIPN, with and without breast cancer, after treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug Dexamethasone (Dex). Circulating MIF levels in animals were examined using ELISA. Pharmacological inhibition of MIF was achieved using the small molecule inhibitors, CPSI-1306 and ISO-1. Mechanical and thermal sensitivities of animals were assessed using von frey filament and cold acetone assays. Macrophage infiltration in peripheral nerve tissues was examined using CD68 and Iba-1 staining. Results: Our results showed that Dex suppressed mechanical hyperalgesia in CisIPN animals, which was accompanied by downregulation of MIF. We also found that circulating MIF levels were increased in CisIPN animals. Furthermore, direct inhibition of MIF using CPSI-1306 and ISO-1 led to suppression of mechanical hyperalgesia, without compromising the anti-tumor efficacy of CP, in CisIPN animals. We did not find any significant change in macrophage infiltration in the peripheral nerve tissues of CisIPN animals. Immunostaining results indicated that sensory neurons in the DRGs and Schwann Cells in the sciatic nerves are potential sources for increased MIF in CisIPN.

Solid tumors such as glioblastoma generate solid stress as they expand, creating a compressive microenvironment for mechanosensitive immune cells including macrophages. Macrophages are known to respond to various mechanical stimuli but have not yet been studied in the context of chronic compression observed in growing tumors. Here, we used a custom in vitro compression system to elucidate the effects of compressive solid stress on murine macrophages. We found that macrophages have significant morphological, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional responses to compression. These changes corresponded to both canonical pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage states. The gene expression signatures of compressed macrophages more closely resembled those of glioma-associated macrophages known to be associated with worse patient outcomes. These results indicate that compression alone, independent from tumor cell-derived biochemical factors, may contribute to the pathological tumor-associated macrophage phenotype. This could represent a vicious cycle of tumor immunomechanics and mechano-immunology.

Despite this, the potential role of endogenous inflammation-resolution circuits in skeletal muscle injury and repair remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of whole-body knockout of leukocyte-type 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) on acute inflammation and regeneration following skeletal muscle injury in mice. Prior to muscle injury, Alox15-/- mice displayed lower intramuscular concentrations of 12/15-LOX-derived lipid mediators than wild type (WT) mice, and this was associated with chronic low-grade muscle inflammation. Alox15-/- mice mounted an exaggerated acute immune response to sterile skeletal muscle injury which was associated with a local imbalance of pro-inflammatory vs. pro-resolving lipid mediators. During the regenerative phase, Alox15-/- mice displayed defects in myogenic gene expression, myofiber size, and myonuclear accretion. Mechanistically, bone marrow-derived macrophages (M[FE]) obtained from Alox15-/- mice produced less 12/15-LOX-derived lipid mediators and this was associated with impaired M2 polarization. Isolated myogenic progenitor cells also produced many LOX metabolites in response to long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) supplementation, including bioactive SPMs. Alox15-/- myoblasts were both impaired in their ability to produce SPMs and were insensitive to the stimulatory effect of LC-PUFAs on in vitro myogenesis.

Here, we investigate AS and GE across three iconic adaptive radiations of African cichlid fishes that evolved within <16,000 to 3.8 million years. We show that AS evolves faster than GE, with both sources of variation being 'fine-tuned' over evolutionary time to become species-specific and clade-specific, respectively. Ecologically divergent species from younger radiations exhibit greater differences in splicing than those from older radiations. Most of these differentially spliced isoforms arose from standing variation, which was also present at low levels in non-radiating species, and increased in frequency during the adaptive radiation process. We identified several novel isoforms of craniofacial remodelling genes that emerged within each lake radiation and were differentially incorporated in the jaws of herbivorous vs. carnivorous species.

Metabolic phenotyping, transcriptomic, functional analyses and histology were performed using standard approaches. Results: Islets from Sptlc2{triangleup}Ins1 mice displayed marked alterations in ceramide and sphingomyelin levels: ceramide content: p=0.016 and p=0.109; sphingomyelin content: p=0.016 and p=0.004 in Sptlc2{triangleup}Ins1 vs Sptlc2CTL mice under regular and high fat diet, respectively, despite compensatory increases in the expression of enzymes in the salvage and sphingomyelinase pathways. Correspondingly, profound abnormalities were observed in glucose-regulated insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in vivo, both on a regular chow and high fat diet. These changes were associated with a drastic (~80%) lowering in {beta}-cell numbers, and a more minor increase in delta cell numbers. They were also preserved in animals maintained on a ketogenic diet, consistent with a cell autonomous effect on the {beta}-cell.

Consistent with roles for compromised SPT2 function in diseased {beta}-cells, Sptl2 expression in Balbc and DBA2J mouse islets was lowered by a high fat-diet.

Conclusions: Preserved de novo ceramide synthesis is required to maintain normal {beta}-cell mass and thus insulin secretion in mice. Therapeutic approaches which seek to target this process systemically using pharmacological SPT2 inhibitors should thus be treated with caution.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

This study trained mice to run at high performance (>10,000 rotations per day or >2,700 rotations per hour) using a running wheel, and then assessed the effects of the removal of bilateral cortical areas including the primary motor cortex on volitional and forced running locomotion. The control sham-operated group revealed a quick recovery of volitional running, reaching half of the maximum daily rotation in 3.9 +/- 2.6 days (n = 10). In contrast, the cortical injury group took significantly a longer period (7.0 +/- 3.3 days, n = 15) to reach half of the maximum volitional daily rotation, but recovered to preoperative levels in about two weeks. Furthermore, even 3 days after surgery to remove cortical regions, the running time on a treadmill moving at 35.3 cm/sec, which is difficult for naive mice to run on, was not significantly different from that in the sham-operated group. These results suggest that the intact primary motor cortex is not necessarily required to execute trained fast-running locomotion, but rather contributes to the spontaneity of running in mice.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

D.; Kishida, O.", "abstract": "Cryptic pigmentation is a key phenotypic adaptation that helps many invertebrates evade visual predators. However, little is known about whether and how the expression of pigmentation phenotypes that match the habitat background is influenced by the availability of nutritional resources. Here we investigated whether variation in both the background and the nutritive composition of benthic substrates affect the expressed pigmentation of freshwater isopods (Asellus hilgendorfii). We collected isopods and their predominant substrate from 17 locations across Hokkaido, northern Japan, and quantified substrate background and nutritional composition (total protein, 18 amino acids, and C:N and C:P ratios). We found that variation in isopod pigmentation was better explained by the substrate's nutritive composition than by its background darkness. Specifically, isopods were more pigmented when substrates had intermediate C:P ratios, lower C:N ratios, and a higher proportion of tryptophan - an essential amino acid involved in the isopods' pigmentation pathway. These results are consistent with previous experiments showing that isopods reared under diets with higher protein concentrations developed more pigmentation, advancing our understanding about the environmental sources of phenotypic variation in natural populations. By demonstrating that nutritional constraints may shape the expression of key phenotypic adaptations in natural populations, our study opens new directions for exploring how organisms navigate adaptive landscapes; particularly in those organisms that rely on pigmentation for signaling and camouflage. Finally, we demonstrate how macronutrients, amino acids, and elemental ratios can serve as biotracers in ecological studies of adaptation, offering new opportunities to examine how stoichiometric traits influence phenotypic plasticity and adaptive capacity, especially in detritivorous taxa.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

F.; Pocrnic, I.", "abstract": "The United Kingdom (UK) is home to many local and rare livestock breeds. The local breed populations are highly adapted to specific environments in the UK and these and other rare breeds provide solutions to niche needs. Rare breeds often contribute more than expected to overall species genetic diversity, which is important because genetic variation is needed for adapting to new challenges. It is therefore very important from both UK and global perspectives to maintain genetic diversity of rare livestock breeds in the UK, and to do this, we need to evaluate the monitoring of genetic diversity to identify gaps in our knowledge and prioritise resources reserved for conservation purposes. The objectives of this study were to survey the literature to: (1) summarise genetic/genomic characterisation (effective population size (Ne) and inbreeding) of domestic populations (livestock and equine) in the UK and Ireland; (2) compare number of populations on the UK's Rare Breed Survival Trust (RBST) watch list and the number of UK and Irish populations in the peer-reviewed literature with inbreeding, genetic diversity and/or Ne estimates; and (3) compare annually reported (census-based) estimates of Ne with (inbreeding and DNA-based) estimates from peer-reviewed literature. We found a total of 37 publications with Ne or inbreeding estimates for UK or Ireland livestock populations, published from 1975 to 2024. While many (42%) of the breeds on the RBST watchlist have been included in publications, there are still many breeds, and a few species (turkey, duck and geese) with no publicly available pedigree- or DNA-based genetic diversity measures. We found census-based Ne estimates were, on average, higher than DNA-based estimates, likely due to violated assumptions when estimating Ne with census-based data because of the way livestock mating systems are designed. Most peer-reviewed papers estimated genetic diversity measures using pedigree, microsatellite markers, or SNP markers. To identify breed-unique variants responsible for adaptive traits in rare breeds, more studies using whole-genome sequencing will be needed.

J.; Doropoulos, C.; Ricardo, G. F.", "abstract": "Synchronous spawning is a specialised adaptation to maximise fertilisation success in free spawning sessile invertebrates. There are many factors that drive and limit reproduction in such benthic invertebrates including localised hydrodynamic forcing, adult density dependence, and fine-scale gamete interactions, all of which are difficult to measure in situ. Therefore, measures to manage or restore reproductive populations of sessile invertebrates rely in part on adequate modelling of spawning processes at localised scales. Fertilisation kinetics of spawning events has been modelled for many free spawning marine invertebrate taxa, yet little work has been done to parameterise such models for hermaphroditic corals. This study used experimentally derived coral-specific parameters and optimisation protocols to improve model predictions of fertilisation outcomes for Acropora kenti (formerly A. Maggie tenuis) and A. digitifera. Three fine scale parameters that are difficult to measure experimentally -fertilisation efficiency (Fe), egg concentration (E0), and polyspermy block strength (tb) - were estimated using optimisation, and medians and 95% confidence intervals were derived for each parameter and species. For A. kenti the median optimised Fe value was 0.0194 (0.0027-0.0776), and tb was 0.1000 (0.1000-0.1000). For A. digitifera, the median optimised Fe value was 0.0013 (0.0002-0.0030), and tb was 10.0000 (2.4703-10.0000). Further, sensitivity analyses suggest that kinetics models are the most sensitive to changes in Fe parameter values, as well as species-specific metrics like sperm swimming speed and egg size. Results will inform biophysical coral fertilisation models to better predict reproductive outcomes and support management decisions that safeguard natural reef recovery.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

This is especially relevant in psychiatric disease, where severe emotional distress can interfere with daily function. As such, understanding the mechanisms by which emotional stimuli compete for attentional resources is a critical area of investigation. Previous studies using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigms observe that emotional distractors disrupt the detection of subsequent stimuli, referred to as emotion-induced blindness (EIB). Our study expands upon this work, characterizing how temporal and perceptual factors shape the emergence and intensity of EIB. Contrary to previous assumptions regarding temporal dynamics of EIB, we found that effects of emotional distractors persisted across prolonged image presentation durations. Further, we investigated the extent to which the depth of distractor processing influences EIB using a distractor recall task. While recall was predictive of EIB magnitude, a significant effect of emotional distractors on target detection was nonetheless present even without conscious recall of the distractor. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the EIB effect in RSVP in the context of temporal and perceptual manipulations.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Hypoxia had a moderate-to-large detrimental effect on general cognitive ability and across domains, including memory, attention, executive function, processing speed, and psychomotor speed. Increased hypoxic severity was associated with greater declines in general cognitive ability and executive function, while longer duration of exposure was associated with greater declines in executive function and psychomotor speed. Participant age was a moderator for executive function and psychomotor speed, with older adults experiencing greater impairments. For executive function and psychomotor speed, the magnitude of these effects was less pronounced during intermittent and hypobaric exposures, potentially due to adaptive physiological mechanisms. While our models accounted for exposure characteristics and age of participants, substantial unexplained variance remained. These findings highlight hypoxias impact on cognition and emphasize the need to investigate underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that may influence individual vulnerability.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

R.; Long, T.; Hannah, R.", "abstract": "The ability to stop a planned or ongoing action is fundamental to inhibitory control. A recent theory proposes that stopping involves two distinct phases: an initial global suppression of motor activity (\"pause\") followed by a selective cancellation of the targeted action. However, the necessity of a second \"cancel\" stage remains debated. We tested whether global suppression alone is sufficient to stop movement by analysing electromyography from task-relevant agonist and antagonist muscles, alongside transcranial magnetic stimulation measures of global motor suppression from task-irrelevant muscles, during a stop-signal task in adult human participants of both sexes. In Experiment 1, reanalysis of ballistic finger movements revealed that agonist muscle offset consistently preceded behavioural stopping, aligning with the time course of global suppression. In Experiment 2, we extended these findings to whole-arm reaching movements, demonstrating that global motor suppression persisted beyond the termination of muscle activity when stopping prevented movement initiation, but disengaged in time for antagonist activation used to interrupt movements once they had begun. These findings challenge the pause-then-cancel model, instead supporting a single-stage global suppression framework. They also suggest that the global suppression mechanism is not a rigid, top-down stopping mechanism but rather part of a broader motor control system that flexibly adjusts movement commands based on task demands.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

K.; Sella, G.", "abstract": "The question of when adaptation involves genetic changes of large effect versus a polygenic response traces back to early debates around Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" and remains unanswered today. While there are compelling reasons to expect polygenic adaptation to be common, direct evidence for it is still lacking. In turn, there are hundreds of examples of large effect adaptations across species, but it is unclear whether they are a common occurrence in any given species. Synthesizing the different lines of evidence is further complicated by differences in study designs, limitations and biases. Here, we reframe this long-standing question in terms of the trait under selection and ask how the genetic basis of adaptation is expected to depend on key properties of the genetic variation in the trait (i.e., the trait genetics) and on the changes in selection pressures that act on it (i.e., the \"trait ecology\"). To study this question, we consider a quantitative trait subject to stabilizing selection and model the response to selection when a population at mutation-selection-drift balance experiences a sudden shift in the optimal value. Using this model, we delimit how the contributions of large effect and polygenic changes to adaptation depend on the genetics and ecology of the trait, as well as other salient factors. This theory allows us to formulate testable predictions about when different modes of adaptation are expected and to outline a framework within which to interpret disparate sources of evidence about the genetic basis of adaptation.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

The most common neurologic sequelae of Fabry are cognitive decline and white matter lesions (WMLs) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the at-large population, however, WMLs are non-specific, highly prevalent, and most are clinically silent. Thus, we compared Fabry to typical brain aging to identify factors unique to Fabry-related cognitive decline. Twenty adult Fabry patients (75% female; median age 36.4 yrs, range: 19.8-63.2 yrs; 95% on enzyme replacement therapy) without a history of stroke or other neurologic diseases and 20 age/sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in a case-control study. All participants underwent a neurocognitive assessment and a 3.0 T MRI study of the brain that used structural MRI (e.g., fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR), semi-quantitative MRI (e.g., normalized FLAIR signal intensity), and quantitative MRI (diffusion tensor imaging, bound-pool fraction imaging). During a blinded review of structural MRIs, a neuroradiologists categorization of case-control status did not correspond to disease status (Fishers test, P>0.99) but rather to age (P=0.004), indicating qualitative changes associated with Fabry were similar to normal age-related brain alterations. Using quantitative MRI, however, we detected evidence of microstructural damage in the white matter of younger Fabry adults (<40 yrs). With age, WML severity increased and the corpus callosum atrophied in Fabry, phenomena absent in controls and consistent with progressive tissue damage. Neurocognitive assessments identified trends for lower verbal intelligence quotient and executive function in the younger Fabry participants, which became statistically significant in the older Fabry cohort. Our data indicate that the early onset of microstructural damage in Fabry drives the insidious degeneration of white matter, leading to reduced cognition. Aging Fabry patients may benefit from serial cognitive assessments to identify unmet therapeutic needs.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Here we evaluate the functional base-of-support (fBOS): the convex polygon on the bottom of the foot that can support a large fraction of the body's weight. First, we develop a geometric model of the fBOS by measuring the center-of-pressure (COP) and kinematic data of the feet of 27 younger adults instructed to move their body mass in large loops without taking a step. We extract a planar convex polygon that contains the COP data. Finally, we compare the area of this fBOS model to a marker-based BOS model before evaluating if the fBOS differs across four everyday conditions: footwear, stance-width, foot dominance, and during single and double stance. We found that the fBOS is much smaller (23% the size) than a marker-based BOS model. Our analysis suggests that using the fBOS, rather than a marker-based BOS, can improve the accuracy of the margin-of-stability by 20% of foot width and 16% of the length. In addition, we found that the fBOS area does not differ across footwear (p=0.88), stance-width (p=0.88), and foot dominance (p=0.68), but during single stance the fBOS is 17% (p=0.0003) larger than during double stance.

Condylar stress fracture is associated with parasagittal groove (PSG) subchondral osteolysis. Standing computed tomography (sCT) imaging allows for sensitive identification of this fatigue-induced structural change, an early form of subchondral bone injury (SBI), but there is not yet an objective method for identifying racehorses at heightened risk of condylar stress fracture. Objectives: To estimate PSG first principal strain in elite Thoroughbred racehorses that have undergone subjective risk assessment using sCT fetlock screening. Study design: Retrospective clinical study. Methods: We used fetlock sCT images from 9 thoracic limbs from 7 Thoroughbred racehorses. A tuned, validated 3D finite element (FE) analysis approach was used as a virtual mechanical test to estimate PSG first principal strain in the distal third metacarpal bone (MC3) from these joints. Virtual mechanical testing results were compared with a subjective clinical risk assessment using an established screening approach by Racing Victoria. Results: MC3 condyles with PSG SBI consistently and significantly displayed increased levels of first principal strain throughout the PSG. We found focal strain concentrations associated with the anatomical location of SBI compared to condyles with no evidence of SBI in the PSG. Clinical diagnosis of SBI with focal osteolysis, FE-predicted strain elevation, and clinical risk assessment were concordant with recall and precision of 0.86. Main limitations: The sample size was small, and our virtual mechanical testing protocol does not account for whole-joint physiology. Conclusions: Risk assessment through screening with sCT is an established approach to injury prevention in racing Thoroughbreds. Concordance of a current clinical risk assessment approach by Racing Victoria with objective FE analysis of principal strain in sites of SBI in the present study suggests 3D FE analysis using a validated pipeline is an important new approach for routine assessment of risk of MC3 condylar stress fracture in Thoroughbred racehorses.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

This view is reminiscent of learning in large language artificial neural networks (ANNs), where training involves statistical associations between symbolic inputs and outputs. Based on this parallel, we hypothesized that brain activity during arithmetic problem-solving should be increasingly similar to ANN-derived representations with learning and development. We used fMRI to investigate the relation between brain activity during single-digit addition problem-solving and ANN features in 104 participants across four age groups (8-, 11-, 14-year-olds, and adults). Vertex-wise encoding models were used to predict brain activity using latent features extracted from pre-trained ANNs. Results revealed that the ANN-based model better predicted arithmetic-related activity in older than younger participants in a specific region of the left precentral sulcus. Prediction accuracy was higher for smaller than larger problems, consistent with the idea that associations between problems may decrease in strength with problem size. Furthermore, ANN prediction patterns aligned with a model in which each addition problem was increasingly represented separately with age. On the one hand, these findings may support the idea that, with learning and development, some neural representations of arithmetic problems become discretely organized in memory and increasingly resemble ANN-like processing. On the other hand, the lack of relation between the ANN-based model and activity in other brain regions suggests some degree of dissimilarity between arithmetic processing in humans and ANNs, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms for simple arithmetic learning in humans.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

It plays a known role in Left-Right (LR) patterning in zebrafish and is linked to human ciliopathies. Here we describe a new Cfap298 mutant allele, Cfap298{Delta}3aa, which selectively interferes with LR axis establishment in mice. Mutant embryos display a range of laterality defects including situs solitus, situs inversus, and situs ambiguous, as indicated by abnormal heart, lung, and stomach positioning. At embryonic day 8.5, mutant embryos display abnormal Nodal, Pitx2, and Lefty1 expression patterns in the lateral plate mesoderm and midline, consistent with an early disruption in LR symmetry breaking. In mice, LR asymmetry is established by leftward fluid flow in the node, generated by planar-polarized cilia. Although cfap298 mutations are reported to affect cell polarity, we did not observe changes in cilia position, length, or planar cell polarity protein localization within the node, suggesting that Cfap298{Delta}3aa functions at the level of cilia motility. Consistently, motile cilia lining the trachea of Cfap298{Delta}3aa mutants fail to beat. Expression of the Cfap298{Delta}3aa variant in zebrafish fails to rescue the LR defects of cfap298 (kurly) loss-of-function mutants.

Although the anterior movement of the murine visceral endo-derm is well documented, the dynamics of the avian hypoblast remain poorly understood. Here, using live imaging and quantitative image analysis, we find that the hypoblast is mechanically coupled to the epiblast and does not migrate away from its posterior end. Instead, the hypoblast moves and deforms passively, in response to the forces transmitted from the epiblast that shape the primitive streak, after its induction. Furthermore, we show that the posterior hypoblast does not exert an inhibitory effect on the epiblast but instead expresses NODAL, which activates primitive streak formation. NODAL concomitantly regulates gene expression in the hypoblast, patterning it along the anteroposterior axis. Our results thus redefine how the primary axis is established in avians, demonstrating that the displacement of the hypoblast and its con-comitant anteroposterior patterning are consequences - rather than drivers - of primitive streak induction, downstream of NODAL signaling.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Few systems exist where accumulations of chromosomal changes can be studied in the context of morphological innovation. In coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid, cuttlefish), an ancient coleoid chromosomal rearrangement event (ACCRE) has led to a substantial increase in the chromosome number and a new set of chromosomal homologies. Compared to typical molluscan or bilaterian genomes, ACCRE has enabled the origin of many novel regulatory regions in coleoid cephalopods. However, the discrepancies between extant octopodiform (octopus, ~30 chromosomes) and decapodiform (squid and cuttlefish, ~46 chromosomes) karyotypes and the direction of these evolutionary changes remain unexplained. Here we provide a draft genome assembly of the vampire squid Vampyroteuthis sp., the largest cephalopod genome sequenced to-date (over 10 gigabasepairs). Through syntenic comparisons, we infer that this basally branching octopodiform species shows partial retention of the chromosomal complement of Decapodiformes, indicating its more ancestrality, while at the same time also suggest the derived nature of the octopod karyotype. Together with the analysis of a new chromosome-level assembly of the pelagic octopod Argonauta hians, we identified irreversible chromosomal fusion-with-mixing events followed by inter-chromosomal translocations in octopods after their separation from the vampire squid lineage. This secondary reduction and mixing within octopod chromosomes has enabled the origin of a more entangled genomic configuration, shedding light onto the early evolutionary transitions within the clade. Our results offer broader insights into general patterns of chromosomal evolution following large-scale rearrangement events in animal genomes, and clarify the evolutionary trajectory leading to present-day coleoid diversity.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

While long-read sequencing technologies promise to resolve complex genomic regions and improve variant detection, their application in polyploid and complex genomes remains challenging. Here, we systematically investigate the factors influencing variant calling accuracy using long reads. Using human trio data with known variants to simulate variable ploidy levels (diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid), we demonstrate that while variant sites can often be identified accurately, genotyping accuracy significantly decreases with increasing ploidy due to allelic dosage uncertainty. This highlights a specific challenge in assigning correct allele counts in polyploids even with high depth, separate from the initial variant discovery. We then assessed variant detection performance in genomes with varying complexity: the relatively simple diploid Fragaria vesca, the tetraploid Solanum tuberosum, and the highly repetitive diploid Zea mays. Our results reveal that overall variant calling accuracy correlates more strongly with inherent genome complexity (e.g., repeat content) than with ploidy level alone. Furthermore, we identify a critical mechanism impacting variant discovery: structural variations between the reference and sample genomes, particularly those containing repetitive elements, induce spurious read mapping. This leads to false variant calls, constituting a distinct and more dominant source of error than allelic-dosage uncertainty. Our findings underscore the multifaceted challenges in long-read variant analysis and highlight the need for ploidy-aware genotypers, complexity-informed variant callers, and bias-aware mapping strategies to fully realize the potential of long reads in diverse organisms.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Individual epithelial cells that acutely express oncogenes such as Ras or Src are extruded apically from monolayers of wildtype cells. Multiple signaling networks have been implicated but the extrusion mechanism is still not fully understood. We examined extrusion of mammary epithelial cells caused by acute induction of oncogenic Ras(Q61L). As reported by others, Ras-dependent extrusion requires downstream activation of ERK but not AKT. Unexpectedly, however, extrusion was completely blocked by Erlotinib, which inhibits Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity, or by deletion of the receptor. In pancreatic and lung cancers, EGFR is required for full activation of Ras and consequent ERK activation. However, inhibition or deletion of EGFR had no impact in our system on Ras(Q61L)-GTP levels or ERK phosphorylation. Importantly, receptor function was cell autonomous, because EGFR expression was not required in surrounding WT cells but was essential in the Ras(Q61L) cells, yet did not act through the canonical ERK signaling pathway. Deletion of Ras exchange factors Sos1/2 did not block cell extrusion. Moreover, expression of a constitutively active MEK mutant, instead of Ras, was sufficient to drive extrusion, and EGFR inhibition or knockout in these cells blocked extrusion, with no change in phospho-ERK levels. Notably, acute expression of Ras triggered internalization of E-cadherin, which was partially blocked by inhibition of EGFR. Knockout of E-cadherin was alone sufficient to promote extrusion. Together, these data demonstrate an unanticipated requirement for noncanonical EGFR signaling in cancer cell extrusion, which may act in part through the promotion of E-cadherin endocytosis.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

M.; Tjian, R.", "abstract": "Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) contain both structured DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). While the structures and sequence preferences of DBDs have been extensively characterized, the role of IDR-mediated interactions in chromatin binding and nuclear organization remains poorly understood, in part because these interactions have been difficult to measure in living cells. Here, we use a recently developed single-molecule technique, proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), to investigate how IDRs influence TF associations with each other and with chromatin, focusing on the factors Sp1 and Klf1. We find that the number and patterning of aromatic and basic residues within IDRs govern both TF self-association and chromatin binding. Remarkably, the isolated DBD of Sp1 binds chromatin weakly and non-specifically. By contrast, the isolated IDR interacts transiently with chromatin-bound full-length Sp1, and these interactions become more stable when even minimal DNA-binding capacity is restored. Replacing Sp1's native DBD with domains from heterologous TFs with differing sequence preferences - or even with nonspecific bacterial DBDs -preserves IDR-mediated interactions and chromatin association. PAPA measurements also reveal extensive heterotypic interactions between Sp1 and other TFs. Together, these results establish PAPA as a powerful method for studying IDR interactions in their native context and suggest that IDRs participate in widespread cooperative associations scaffolded around chromatin. In contrast to classical models, we propose that TF specificity in vivo emerges from ensembles of weak, dynamic, and diverse interactions - not from the intrinsic sequence preferences of DBDs alone.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

However, broader application is often limited by complex substrate syntheses, the requirement of long or rigid recognition tags, and limited reaction efficiencies. Here, we present ADDing, a straightforward enzymatic method for functionalizing proteins with click chemistry handles using the flavin transferase ApbE. We discovered that, given a dedicated adenine diphosphate derivative (ADD) substrate, the enzyme attaches a phosphoribosyl moiety bearing bioorthogonal handles to proteins featuring a DxxxGAT amino acid motif. As the substrates can easily be enzymatically synthesized from NAD and inexpensive precursors, ADDing click handles can be performed in a streamlined, one-pot workflow combining substrate synthesis and protein conjugation. ADDing allows rapid, high-yield functionalization of proteins featuring the recognition tag at either terminus or internal loops and is compatible with copper and copper free azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions.

RHOM39R is one of the most common RHO variants linked to sector RP in the UK. A knock-in (KI) mouse model expressing RhoM39R was generated and characterized to investigate the mechanisms of degeneration associated with this variant and explore novel therapeutic strategies for rhodopsin sector RP. Under ambient light, RhoM39R/+ KI mice exhibited impaired retinal function by ERG, with some defects in OS ultrastructure, but retained normal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness. Repeated exposure to bright light led to photoreceptor loss.

Although the virus was discovered over sixty years ago and undergoes continuous antigenic drift, remarkably little is known about the humoral immune response to HCoV-229E infection. Here we report the isolation of two receptor binding domain-targeting neutralizing human antibodies raised in response to natural HCoV-229E infection. One of these, DH1533, potently neutralizes HCoV-229E, binds to spike with sub-nanomolar affinity and prevents the association between the RBD and the host cell receptor aminopeptidase N. Structural characterization of this antibody bound to HCoV-229E spike delineated a neutralization-sensitive epitope on the RBD and revealed that DH1533 induces conformational flexibility in neighboring RBDs, reminiscent of the up-and-down kinetics observed in the related Betacoronavirus spikes. These findings provide insight into the humoral immune response to HCoV-229E infection and will serve as a guide for the design of future therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

The coordination between cell length and cell cycle phase transitions in this simple eukaryote makes it an excellent model system for studying morphogenetic events associated with both intrinsic and extrinsic disturbances in cell cycle regulation. Cell cycle progression in S. pombe is dependent on the coordinated functions of two bZIP family transcription factors Atf1 and Pcr1. In an attempt to understand this coordination, we stumbled upon the startling observation that overexpression of Atf1 in cells lacking Pcr1 led to drastic morphogenetic alteration whereby the cells became hyper elongated. In this report we present the evidences of dependence of this phenotype on metabolic status of the cell. We also show that the phenotype is dependent on the activity of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase, Spc1 and that it is associated with the global gene expression alterations of cells resulting from the perturbed balance of Atf1 and Pcr1 activities. We found that change in the carbon source, alterations in iron concentration and the redox environment of the cell can affect the extent of morphogenesis, to the extent of even abolishing it at times. Our results also indicate that this phenotype has a strong association with maintenance of optimum growth conditions of the cell. Taken together, our observations reveal a completely novel mechanism of morphogenetic transition in fission yeast involving the MAPK Spc1 and its downstream effector molecule Atf1, which can be tuned by the cells metabolic environment.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Methods: Total indole production was measured in 16 F. nucleatum isolates (CRC: n=6, Crohn's: n=6, healthy: n=3, oral: n=1) using Kovac's reagent. Disease-associated indole derivatives-indole, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-aldehyde (I3A), indole-3-carboxaldehyde (I3CA), and indole-3-propionic acid (IPA)-were quantified via HPLC. Isolates were treated with exogenous derivatives to assess impacts on biofilm formation and virulence gene expression. A naive Bayes classifier trained on virulence factor data evaluated niche-specific responses. Results: CRC isolates produced significantly more total indole than healthy isolates (p<0.05). Indole derivatives minimally affected non-CRC isolate growth but reduced CRC isolate carrying capacity. Total indole positively correlated with biofilm formation in CRC isolates (R2=0.50-0.70; p<0.001). Crohn's isolates formed most biofilm but were unresponsive to indoles; CRC isolates showed reduced formation.

However, the limited availability of versatile genetic tools and secretion assays constrain both fundamental studies and bioengineering of B. bacteriovorus. Here, we developed a molecular toolbox for B. bacteriovorus by systematically tuning gene expression and secretion of a reporter protein. We investigated functional native and synthetic promoters from the Anderson library with varying expression levels and demonstrated their efficacy in driving expression of the fluorescent reporter protein mScarletI3 at both the population and single-cell level. Additionally, we evaluated different ribosomal binding sites (RBS) to fine-tune gene expression. To examine secretion, we established a novel protocol to quantify extracellular release of a Nanoluc luciferase reporter protein in B. bacteriovorus using different native Sec-dependent signal sequences. We anticipate that the newly developed genetic toolkit and techniques will advance research on this fundamental predator-prey system, laying the foundation for its broader application and future bioengineering efforts.

S.", "abstract": "Cross-feeding, a phenomenon in which organisms share metabolites, is frequently observed in microbial communities across the natural world. One of the most common forms is waste-product cross-feeding, a unidirectional interaction in which the waste products of one microbe support the growth of another. Despite its ubiquity, it is not well-understood why waste-product cross-feeding persists when a single organism could in principle perform both the producer and consumer role. To address this question, we first analyze cross-feeding evolution in a minimal model of microbial metabolism. The model describes multi-step extraction of energy from a substrate in a simple but thermodynamically correct formulation. Surprisingly, we find that cross-feeding is never evolutionarily stable in this model. By analyzing models with more complex growth functions, we identify a novel mechanism for the evolutionary stability of waste-product cross-feeding, namely, generalized intracellular metabolite toxicity. Such toxicity arises because, in excess, the same intracellular metabolites that cells require for metabolism can be detrimental to growth (e.g., due to osmotic stress). We show that some but not all forms of such toxicity can lead to evolutionarily stable consortia of microbes that cross-feed waste products. This stability results from the potential of such consortia to divide the burden of toxic metabolites among a larger population, allowing them to perform their collective metabolism more efficiently than non-cross-feeders. More generally, we predict that growth penalties that scale nonlinearly with intracellular metabolite levels promote cross-feeding. We find that this mechanism for cross-feeding evolutionary stability implies nontrivial population dynamics, such as a discontinuity in population biomass at the onset of cross-feeding.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Functional interactions between PcG and TrxG on these promoters are not fully understood. Here we focus on the relationships between Fbxl10/Kdm2b, a component of a PcG complex PRC1, and Kmt2b/Mll2, an essential component of TrxG at bivalent promoters. Computational analysis of previously published data revealed genome-wide correlation between chromatin occupancies of these two proteins, suggesting potential crosstalk between Kdm2b and Mll2 at both active and repressed promoters. We tested this hypothesis experimentally and found that loss of Kdm2b resulted in depletion of Mll2 at promoters genome-wide, suggesting that Kdm2b is required for Mll2 occupancy at both bivalent and active promoters. Loss of Kdm2b or the core PRC1 component Ring1b also resulted in the reduction of H3K4me3 specifically at bivalent promoters. These findings provide a direct pathway for cooperation between PcG and TrxG at bivalent promoters, suggesting an unexpected modification to the current model of bivalency.

Despite its impact on profitability, the underlying mechanisms driving soil fatigue remain poorly understood; however, a strong link to shifts in the soil microbiome has been suggested. We investigated the dynamics of microbial communities in relation to soil fatigue, using a novel semi-controlled outdoor experimental system. Soils at different stages of fatigue (0 to 42 months of banana cultivation) were generated in large containers filled with initially healthy soil. Banana plants grown in these soils were replaced with new plants which showed soil age-dependent growth. Three months postplanting, soil and root samples were collected for analyses of soil parameters and microbial community composition using bacterial (16S) and fungal (ITS) amplicon sequencing. We identified minor age-related shifts in mainly pH, potassium, and organic matter in the soil. While alpha diversity remained unchanged, significant shifts in bacterial and fungal community composition were observed in fatigued soils. Notably, the relative abundance of bacterial families such as Flavobacteriaceae, Pseudomonaceae, and Acidibacter increased, as did some fungal taxa (many from groups with known pathogens)-Ceratobasidiaceae (including Rhizoctonia), Dothideomycetes, and Stachybotryaceae. Simultaneously, the relative abundance of bacterial families with known beneficial members, including Gemmatimonadaceae, Moraxellaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Azospirillaceae, as well as symbiotic fungal taxa such as Glomeraceae and Lasiosphaeriaceae, declined. Thus, soil fatigue may be correlated to proliferation of pathogenic populations and a loss of beneficial microorganisms.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Despite the autosomal recessive nature of the disease, no variant on the second allele was identified by gene panel sequencing. To identify a potential missing second pathogenic variant, we completed whole genome sequencing (WGS) and detected putative deep intronic splicing variant in PHKG2 in both siblings. We confirmed the functional splicing effects of this variant using short-read and long-read RNA-seq on patient blood and a HEK293T cell model in which we installed the variant using CRISPR editing. Using the cell model, we demonstrated multiple biochemical and cellular impacts that are consistent with GSD IX {gamma}2, and a reversal of aberrant splicing using antisense splice-switching oligonucleotides.

However, the alterations in higher-order genome organization in which these changes occur and their functional implications are less well understood. To explore how chromatin structure and epigenetic parameters of genome architecture changes during cancer progression at a fine scale and genome-wide, we generated high-resolution Micro-C contact maps in non-malignant, pre-cancerous, and metastatic MCF10 breast cancer epithelial cells. Results: We profiled progression-associated reorganization of chromatin compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), and chromatin loops, and also identified invariable chromatin features. We find large-scale compartmental shifts occur predominantly in early stages of cancer development, with more fine-scale structural changes in TADs and looping accumulating during the later transition to metastasis. We related these structural features to changes in gene expression, histone marks, and potential enhancers and found a large portion of differentially expressed genes physically connected to distal regulatory elements. While changes in chromatin loops were relatively rare during progression, differential loops were enriched for progression-associated genes, including those involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, and differentiation. Changes in either enhancer-promoter contacts or distal enhancer activity were accompanied by differential gene regulation, suggesting that changes in chromatin contacts are not necessary but can be sufficient for gene regulation.

SET-mediated Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibition in KRAS mutant cells promotes S166 phosphorylation. Endogenous LSD1 S166 alanine mutant (S166A) cells display H3 lysine 9 demethylation and acetylation, euchromatin, and gene activation. Mechanistically this is explained by the impaired interaction of S166A mutant LSD1 with repressor proteins SNAI2 and MYBP1. Functionally LSD1 S166A mutant cells display augmented beta1 integrin activity and stress fiber formation, and the mutant xenograft tumors have altered tumor microenvironment associated with increased macrophage recruitment.

Not only do they exhibit nearly unparalleled taxonomic diversity, but their community structures are both complex and extremely dense. Niche partitioning along dietary axes has been credited in maintaining cichlid biodiversity in a broad sense; however, it is common for cichlid species with overlapping diets to co-exist, leading to the search for other mechanisms to explain the maintenance of cichlid biodiversity. Behavioral variation has the potential to lead to fine-scale (i.e., micro-) habitat partitioning, but analyzing complex animal behavior poses several challenges, including time, cost and reproducibility. Modern tools, such as Machine Learning (ML), ease the burden of behavioral analyses, and are increasingly used in the field. Here, we present the application of tools from a well-developed sub-field of ML, Computer Vision (CV), to extract locomotor behavioral data from four Lake Malawi cichlid species. Our dataset consisted of low-resolution (320x240), twenty-four-hour infrared videos of activity in 4 cichlid species. We first analyzed a pair of species with divergent behaviors, diets and habitats (i.e., Abactochromis labrosus versus Tropheops kumwera), representing a proof-of-concept comparison. Next we analyzed activity in two closely related species with broadly similar behaviors and overlapping diets and habitats (i.e., Maylandia sp. \"Daktari\" versus Maylandia faiaziberi). In both comparisons, our analysis involved the quantification of tank usage patterns and stop/rest activity. Not only did our data align with the known ecologies and behaviors of the species in our proof-of-concept comparison, but they revealed novel behavioral differences between all species, especially as related to variation in tank usage from day to night.

This is pronounced for aerial hawking bat species, for which prey activity is highly dependent on ambient temperature. Here, we describe changes in activity of female Eptesicus nilssonii, the northernmost breeding bat species, during gestation and lactation over several years at a roost site in southern Norway. Roost exits and returns were recorded using an infrared barrier at the entrance, and parturition dates were registered via a camera set inside the roost. Our results indicate significant temporal changes in body mass and behaviour throughout the breeding season. Lactating bats both setting out to forage earlier than during gestation and returning later. This behaviour is dependent on ambient temperature, with bats extending foraging time at elevated temperatures. These behaviours may occur as a response to the increased energetic needs of lactation, and the effect of increased temperature to reflect increased food availability which allows females to avoid increased predation pressure as a consequence of advanced roost exit or delayed return. The mass of females also decreases during lactation, suggesting high energetic demands during this period.

These complexes assemble into hexagonal arrays that network multiple active units together. The cytoplasmic fragment of the E. coli aspartate chemoreceptor exhibits dynamics on multiple timescales across different regions of the protein, and these dynamics differ between signaling states. We apply 13C-15N dipolar coupling-based SSNMR experiments to selectively probe the rigid portion (motions slower than millisecond timescale) of this protein, in the context of the full array structure. We optimized assembly methods to form native-like, homogeneous complexes capable of maintaining activity and sample integrity during extended NMR experiments with low electric-field NMR probe designs. A subset of the protein, approximately 100 residues at the membrane-distal tip of the chemoreceptor where it interacts with its associated kinase, was detected and identified as the most rigid region. Chemical shift changes for many residues in this rigid region were observed between NMR spectra of the kinase-on and kinase-off signaling states.

We show here that PPM1H also contains an allosteric binding site for its non-phosphorylated reaction products, Rab8A and Rab10. Microscale thermophoresis revealed that PPM1H binds thio-phosphorylated Rab8A at the active site with a KD of about 1 micromolar; binding of Rab8A and Rab10 to an alternative site is of similar affinity and is not detected for another LRRK2 substrate, Rab12. Non-phosphorylated Rab8A or Rab10 inhibit PPM1H phosphatase reactions at concentrations consistent with their measured binding affinities and fail to inhibit PPM1H L66R phosphatase reactions. Independent confirmation of non-phosphorylated Rab binding to PPM1H was obtained by sucrose gradient co-flotation of non-phosphorylated Rabs with liposome-bound PPM1H. Finally, Rab8A or Rab10 binding also requires PPM1Hs amphipathic helix, without which the interaction affinity is decreased about 6-fold. These experiments indicate that Golgi associated Rab proteins contribute to the localization of PPM1H and non-phosphorylated Rabs regulate PPM1H phosphatase activity via an allosteric site.

Finally, we show that while >60% of all predicted transcriptional activation domains overlap with strong degrons, acidic residues within the remaining transactivating regions counter the degron potency.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "This study investigates the chemical inhibition of asexual development in Aspergillus nidulans to enhance the mechanical properties of mycelial materials. We hypothesized that suppressing conidiation using the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor -difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) would increase material strength by inhibiting asexual development, promoting denser hyphal packing. Mycelial materials were grown in DFMO concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mM), and conidiation and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) were measured. Results showed a dose-dependent reduction in conidiation, with significant decreases at all DFMO levels (P [&le;] 0.05). While lower DFMO concentrations (0.05 and 0.5 mM) did not significantly alter UTS, 5 mM DFMO treatment doubled the material's tensile strength compared to controls (P [&le;] 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed reduced developmental structures in DFMO-treated samples, supporting the hypothesis. The non-linear relationship between conidiation suppression and strength improvement suggests additional mechanisms, such as hyphal morphology or cell wall changes, may contribute. These findings demonstrate that chemical modulation of fungal development can rationally tune mycelial material properties, offering a systematic approach for biomaterial engineering.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

F.; Hamoudi, R. A.; Kishore, U.; Fernandez Cabezudo, M.; Al Ramadi, B.", "abstract": "Cancer is a leading global cause of mortality, responsible for nearly 10 million deaths annually, with breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers among the most prevalent. Despite extensive research on individual cancer types, identifying shared molecular signatures could unlock pan-cancer diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets. This study leveraged RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to analyze our selected cancer types (SCTs), breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate, employing a multi-step bioinformatics pipeline. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumors and normal tissues were identified and validated using an Elastic Net regression model. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) revealed highly correlated gene modules linked to clinical traits, pinpointing 179 shared signature genes across the SCTs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and clustering analyses further refined these to 26 hub genes, enriched in cancer hallmark pathways. Nine hub genes KIF18B, RRM2, MYBL2, IQGAP3, TPX2, SLC7A11, RHPN1, HJURP, and SKA3 are stood out due to consistent upregulation in metastatic tumors (breast, colorectal, prostate) and their high expression across more than 18 different cancer types, suggesting roles as oncogenes, prognostic markers, or therapeutic targets. The expression patterns of hub genes were further validated across larger cancer patient cohorts of SCTs, confirming relevance across multiple datasets, and their prognostic significance was assessed by their influence on overall survival (OS). Notably, these hub genes also correlated with immune-related functions, potentially influencing tumor microenvironment modulation. This integrative approach provides a strong framework for identifying cross-cancer potential biomarkers, advancing pan-cancer insights, and supporting improved diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy development.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

R.; Medvedev, P.; Koslicki, D.; Blanca, A.", "abstract": "Methods utilizing k-mers are widely used in bioinformatics, yet our understanding of their statistical properties under realistic mutation models remains incomplete. Previously, substitution-only mutation models have been considered to derive precise expectations and variances for mutated k-mers and intervals of mutated and nonmutated sequences. In this work, we consider a mutation model that uses insertions and deletions in addition to single-nucleotide substitutions. Within this framework, we derive closed-form k-mer-based-estimators for the three fundamental mutation parameters: substitution rate, deletion rate, and average insertion length. We provide statistics of k-mers under this model and theoretical guarantees via concentration inequalities, ensuring correctness under reasonable conditions. Empirical evaluations on simulated evolution of genomic sequences confirm our theoretical findings, demonstrating that accounting for indel signals allows for accurate estimation of mutation rates and improves upon the results obtained by considering a substitution-only model.

R.", "abstract": "Guanine-rich nucleic acids can form a unique secondary structure called Guanine-quadruplexes (G4s). These G4s are conserved across all domains of life and in viruses, where they can play important regulatory roles in the viral lifecycle. In flaviviruses, the (-) strand 3 untranslated region (UTR) is essential for initiating genomic RNA synthesis. Within the (-) strand 3 UTR of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a highly conserved G4 is located within stem-loop IIy (SLIIy), spanning nucleotides 110-131--a region that is essential for efficient replication. Using bioinformatics, we demonstrate that nucleotides 110-131 are highly conserved across HCV genotypes 1-7, and this region within SLIIy can likely adopt a more energetically favorable G4 conformation rather than the predicted hairpin. From biophysical and cell biology experiments, we show that stabilizing the predicted hairpin structure in SLIIy disrupts RNA synthesis, while successive guanine-to-adenine mutations within the G4 sequence impair G4 formation and hinder replication. Combining our findings with prior studies, we propose that the SLIIy G4 plays a crucial role in recruiting NS3 helicase, which is necessary for unwinding RNA structures and facilitating access for NS5B polymerase. The G4 may serve as a regulatory switch that modulates helicase binding and replication efficiency. We propose that in the absence of a stable G4, NS3 recruitment or unwinding is impaired, leading to inefficient RNA unwinding and reduced polymerase activity, ultimately hindering viral replication. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for G4 structures in the HCV replication cycle, highlighting their importance in regulating (+) strand RNA synthesis.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

While the former typically relies on various mechanical tests - such as tensile, compression, bending, and shear - performed on sample parts, the latter often employs acoustic techniques or wave propagation through matter. The choice of techniques will depends on the size of the sample of interest and the desired resolution. In our case, to probe the mechanical properties of sub-millimetre micro-tissues, it is necessary to use methods with high resolution and as furtive as possible. We present a method based, 1/ on imaging the displacement of microbeads within a hydrogel resulting from the growth of a three-dimensional micro-tissue and, 2/ on finite element modelling of the deformations underlying bead displacements. This approach allows us to determine the elastic properties of the hydrogel and, in particular, to show that beyond a certain thickness, incomplete cross-linking of the hydrogel results in a stiffness gradient. We show that when the micro-tissue contacts with an immediately rigid alginate wall, the pressure exerted over time increases very rapidly, whereas when the micro-tissue encounters a substrate with a stiffness gradient, the pressure increase is more gradual. Uncovering this could provide a better understanding of the role of tumour microenvironment stiffness in metastatic escape processes.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

To bridge high-resolution molecular imaging with electrophysiological properties of individual neurons, we developed a Correlative-Voltage Imaging and cryo-ET (CoVET) technique. The nondestructive nature of voltage imaging is compatible with cryo-ET, enabling a direct correlation between neuronal electrophysiology and molecular structures. Neurons were clustered based on their electrophysiological properties, allowing for single-cell-guided structural analysis using cryo-ET.

Despite its importance, systems-level analysis of phosphotyrosine signaling remains a challenge due to costly enrichment reagents and labor-intensive protocols.

Here, we further optimize this method by fusing an SH2 phosphotyrosine superbinder to the HaloTag protein. This allows simple and cost-effective preparation of enrichment beads directly from bacterial lysate, expediting reagent preparation from days to hours. Additionally, our new reagent binds phosphotyrosine peptides at higher efficiency than other enrichment reagents. Using this reagent, we detect and quantify 1,651 unique phosphotyrosine sites from EGF stimulated HeLa cells using only ~1 mg of input peptides per replicate. These include 878 regulated pY sites, many of which are low abundance and not previously detected or annotated as EGF-responsive. This streamlined and sensitive method facilitates comprehensive, quantitative mapping of tyrosine phosphorylation dynamics, enabling broader integration of phosphotyrosine signaling into multiomic and network-level models across diverse biological systems and disease states.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

While AML is radiation-sensitive, total body irradiation (TBI) causes organ toxicities and activates tolerogenic/proangiogenic STAT3 signaling. CSI-2, a myeloid cell-targeted STAT3 inhibitor, promotes anti-leukemic immune responses but has limited efficacy against high disease burden. We investigated whether image-guided targeted marrow irradiation (TMI), which focuses radiation on leukemia sites while sparing critical organs, could synergize with CSI-2 to improve leukemia clearance and establish durable immunity. Methods: Mice were intravenously engrafted with CMM-AML cells reaching 20-30% in bone marrow (BM) infiltration (moderate-to-high disease burden) before receiving IV-injections of CSI-2 (5mg/kg) with or without TMI. Fluorescently-labeled CSI-2 biodistribution was assessed using flow cytometry and quantitative multiphoton microscopy. Survival was monitored for 3-4 months before evaluating BM composition using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Results: TMI significantly improved vascular permeability and scavenger receptor/TLR9-dependent uptake of CSI-2 by AML cells and leukemia-associated myeloid cells. Combined TMI/CSI-2 treatment more effectively reduced high leukemia burden than CSI-2 alone, achieving >80% survival at 120 days with increased CD8+ cytotoxic and CD4+ helper T cell infiltration. TMI/CSI-2-treated mice were protected from AML rechallenge suggesting that they developed protective immune memory. In an aggressive MLL-AF9 AML model, TMI/CSI-2 combination significantly extended survival compared to either monotherapy. Conclusion: TMI/CSI-2 strategy represents a novel organ-sparing immunoradiotherapy that synergistically enhances leukemia clearance while promoting long-term protective immunity. These findings warrant further investigation of this strategy for high-burden or relapsed AML and provide the foundation for clinical translation.", "date": "2025-05-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the generation of Gzmb-Cre knock-in mice, that when crossed with inducible Diphtheria toxin receptor mice, allows targeted and inducible ablation of IELs without perturbing peripheral immunity. Using this model (referred to as IELiDTR), we demonstrate that IELs are dispensable for intestinal homeostasis, including epithelial architecture, barrier function and microbial composition. However, loss of IELs led to increased intestinal infection by Salmonella Typhimurium and Cryptosporidium parvum, but did not affect responses to Listeria monocytogenes infection or DSS colitis. Interestingly, IEL deficiency reduced fecundity of the intestinal nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, despite unaltered worm burden, suggesting a permissive role in helminth colonization.

Despite the increasing awareness, there is a fundamental gap in understanding which interactions govern microbial community composition. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is frequently isolated from monomicrobial and polymicrobial human infections. This pathogen forms polymicrobial infections with other ESKAPEE pathogens and defies eradication by conventional therapies. By analyzing the competi-tion within cocultures of P. aeruginosa and representative secondary pathogens that commonly co-infect patients, we demonstrate the antagonism of P. aeruginosa against other ESKAPEE pathogens and the contribution of this pathogens multiple quorum sensing (QS) systems in these interac-tions. QS is a highly conserved bacterial cell-to-cell communication mechanism that coordinates collective gene expressions at the population level, and it is also involved in P. aeruginosa virulence. Using a collection of P. aeruginosa QS mutants of the three major systems, LasR/LasI, MvfR/PqsABCDE, and RhlR/RhlI and mutants of several QS-regulated functions, we reveal that MvfR and, to a lesser extent, LasR and RhlR control competition between P. aeruginosa and other microbes, possibly through their positive impact on pyoverdine, pyochelin, and phenazine genes. We show that MvfR inhibition alters competitive interspecies interactions and preserves the coex-istence of P. aeruginosa with ESKAPEE pathogens tested while disarming the pathogens ability to form biofilm and adhere to lung epithelial cells. Our results highlight the role of MvfR inhibition in modulating microbial competitive interactions across multiple species, while simultaneously atten-uating virulence traits.
