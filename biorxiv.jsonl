Rapid and accurate saliva diagnostic testing, alongside basic public health responses, is a viable option contributing to effective transmission control. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in saliva is not as advanced as our understanding of the respiratory tract. Here we analyzed longitudinal viral load data of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples from 144 patients with mild COVID-19 (a combination of our collected data and published data). Using a mathematical model, we quantified individual-level viral dynamics and stratified them into three groups using a clustering approach. Notably, the three groups exhibited distinct differences viral RNA detection durations: 11.5 days (95% CI: 10.6 to 12.4), 17.4 days (16.6 to 18.2), and 30.0 days (28.1 to 31.8), respectively. Surprisingly, this stratified grouping remained unexplained despite our analysis of 47 types of clinical data, including basic demographic information, clinical symptoms, results of blood tests, and vital signs. Additionally, we quantified the expression levels of 92 micro-RNAs in a subset of saliva samples, but these also failed to explain the observed stratification, although the mir-1846 level may have been weakly correlated with peak viral load. Our study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in saliva, highlighting the challenges in predicting the duration of viral RNA detection without indicators that directly reflect an individual's immune response, such as antibody induction. Given the significant individual heterogeneity in the kinetics of saliva viral shedding, identifying biomarker(s) for viral shedding patterns will be crucial for improving public health interventions in the era of living with COVID-19.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, they are expected to be very detectable by the visual systems due to their periodic geometry and contrasted two-tone coloring, therefore potential specific biological functions are suspected. Here, thanks to a biological survey, we draw the first diversity landscape of eukaryotic species bearing checkerboard patterns, confirming their rarity but also their presence in extremely diverse clades. Then, we selected two genera, Sarcophaga flies and Fritillaria flowers, to perform in-depth pattern analyses allowing us to make strong hypotheses on the mechanisms producing these very peculiar patterns, as no morphogenetic process was known to generate checkerboards. Although they share a similar geometry, these two genera appear to produce checkerboards through very different ways, showing a convergence of shape but not of processes. Whereas the Fritillaria analysis points to a geometric constraining of a Turing-like pattern by the parallel network of veins, that of Sarcophaga suggest the reuse of developmental boundaries and right-left symmetry, together by the combination of vertical and horizontal stripes. Furthermore, we present the first description to our knowledge of the striking color-changing nature of Sarcophaga checkerboards, whose light and dark squares can exchange their color depending on the angles of lighting and observation thanks to the planar polarity of the cuticular hairs, the setae. Together, this shows the extent of the processes selected during evolution to generate complex forms and colors, and confirms the importance of studying morphogenesis with in-depth pattern analyses and through species diversity. Finally, by enabling strong hypotheses to be made about the morphogenesis of these patterns, it paves the way for the molecular identification of the morphogenetic processes at work.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework's '30 by 30' target requires an estimated additional US$700 billion annually. Biodiversity credit markets seek to address this funding gap by assigning financial value to biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, limited understanding of the metrics underpinning these credits pose significant barriers to their scalability and effectiveness. This pioneering study compares six credit metrics with six established biodiversity metrics to assess whether methodology choice influences metric responses to different ecosystem perturbations, identifying metrics best suited for specific interventions, and exploring comparability across metrics. A spatially explicit, multi-layered metacommunity simulation model, capable of reproducing a variety of empirically established macro-ecological patterns, was adapted to track ecosystem responses to six perturbation experiments and to record changes in the twelve tracked biodiversity metrics. Results reveal substantial divergence in how credit metrics assign value to nature, particularly between those estimating ecosystem services and those assessing species extinction risk. These findings underscore the need for careful alignment between metric selection and the ecological objectives of biodiversity projects and suggest that the development of a universal biodiversity credit is unlikely. Furthermore, in addition to metrics estimating ecosystem services, our results suggest that projects should incorporate metrics that are sensitive to declines in species-level abundances, thereby reflecting extinction risk.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Transformation occurs when bacteria import exogenous DNA via the competence machinery and integrate it into their genome through homologous recombination (HR). This process may provide an evolutionary advantage to cells through enabling \"chromosomal curing\": the deletion of integrative mobile genetic elements (MGEs). However, many such MGEs are sensitive to RecA-DNA filaments, triggering activation of a lifecycle that may enable them to evade HR-mediated deletion. Despite >40% of isolates containing prophage integrated at a site that inhibits transformation, three representative prophage were identified in naturally-competent pneumococci to test this hypothesis. These encompassed representatives with C1-type and ImmAR-type regulatory systems, found in almost all pneumococcal prophage. All three prophage were deleted by HR with an efficiency similar to the transfer of base substitutions. Mutations that impaired a C1-regulated prophage increased this deletion rate, reflecting this element being activated by RecA-DNA filaments imported during transformation, likely preferentially killing cells that induce competence. ImmAR-regulated prophage instead responded to transient stimuli by excising as deletion-resistant pseudolysogens, only driving cell lysis in response to sustained stimuli. This was likely a consequence of these prophage reacting to multiple signals, as they differed in their response to both RecA and the DNA-binding protein and competence repressor DprA. One prophage constitutively elevated host DprA levels, thereby reducing transformation by preventing induction of the competence machinery. Hence these data are consistent with an evolutionary arms race between prophage and the competence machinery, resulting in bacterial diversification though HR being impeded by MGEs preventing their own elimination from the chromosome.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Zenon (2019) proposed a unifying framework stating that pupil dilation related to cognition should be considered from an information-theory perspective. In the current study, we investigated whether the pupil's response to decision outcome in the context of associative learning reflects a prediction error signal defined operationally as an interaction between stimulus-pair frequency and accuracy, while also exploring the time course of this prediction error signal. Thereafter, we tested whether these prediction error signals correlated with information gain, defined formally as the KL divergence between posterior and prior belief distributions of the ideal observer. We reasoned that information gain should be proportional to the (precision-weighted) prediction error signals potentially arising from neuromodulatory arousal networks. To do so, we adapted a simple model of trial-by-trial learning of stimulus probabilities based on information theory from previous literature. We analyzed two data sets in which participants performed perceptual decision-making tasks that required associative learning while pupil dilation was recorded. Our findings consistently showed that a significant proportion of variability in the post-feedback pupil response during decision-making can be explained by a formal quantification of information gain shortly after feedback presentation in both task contexts. In the later time window, the relationship between information-theoretic variables and the post-feedback pupil response differed per task. For the first time, we present evidence that whether the post-feedback pupil dilates or constricts along with information gain was context dependent. This study offers empirical evidence showcasing how the pupil's response can offer valuable insights into the process of model updating during learning, highlighting the promising utility of this readily accessible physiological indicator for investigating internal belief states.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

We also demonstrate physical Scube2 interactions with LPPs and that these interactions increase Shh release. Finally, we demonstrate that Scube2 strongly binds to heparan sulfate (HS) on cell surfaces.

C.; Mobilia, M.", "abstract": "Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Epigenetic mechanisms, including histones and their post-translational modifications, play a crucial role in regulating programs integral to a cell's identity, like gene expression and DNA replication. However, the transcriptional, chromatin, and replication timing profiles of adult stem cells in vivo remain poorly understood. Containing germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs), the Drosophila testis provides an excellent in vivo model for studying adult stem cells. However, the small number of stem cells and cellular heterogeneity of this tissue have limited comprehensive genomic studies. In this study, we developed cell type-specific genomic techniques to analyze the transcriptome, histone modification patterns, and replication timing of GSC-like and CySC-like cells. Single cell RNA sequencing validated previous findings on GSC-CySC intercellular communication and revealed high expression of chromatin regulators in GSC-like cells. To characterize chromatin landscapes, we developed a cell-type-specific chromatin profiling assay to map H3K4me3-, H3K27me3-, and H3K9me3-enriched regions, corresponding to euchromatic, facultative heterochromatic, and constitutive heterochromatic domains, respectively. Finally, we determined cell type-specific replication timing profiles, integrating our in vivo datasets with published data using cultured cell lines. Our results reveal that GSC-like cells display a distinct replication program compared to somatic lineages, that aligns with chromatin state differences.

Little is known about how these are controlled and cell-cycle checkpoints are particularly poorly characterised. However, parasites can arrest their cell cycle when treated with the frontline antimalarial drug artemisinin, and artemisinin-resistant parasites can modulate their cell-cycle progression, so it is very important to understand these aspects of Plasmodium biology. Here, we show that P. falciparum displays hallmarks of an intra-S-phase checkpoint when exposed to DNA damage, including acute reduction of DNA replication and phosphorylation of a putative damage-marker histone. Compounds that inhibit human checkpoint kinases can inhibit this arrest of DNA replication, and synergise with DNA damage in parasite killing. This suggests the existence of checkpoint kinase activity in P. falciparum, yet these kinases have no clear homologues in Plasmodium genomes. We hypothesise that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase - an essential lipid kinase - may moonlight in this role: it is the closest homologue to a checkpoint kinase and is reportedly up-regulated in artemisinin-resistant parasites. Finally, we show that the cryptic checkpoint-kinase activity may also regulate the ring-stage survival phenotype after artemisinin damage, which resembles a G1/S checkpoint. Hence we suggest that checkpoint kinase inhibitors are candidates for synergy with artemisinin.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

To address these questions, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla to map the fate of 96 associative memories at the systems level from learning to a 30-minute and onward to a 24-hour memory test. Upon each retrieval attempt, participants indicated whether they remembered or forgot the memory. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the functional brain data revealed that the engrams of forgotten memories remain implemented in the episodic memory network and continue to influence the accuracy of guessing responses at the memory test. Overnight, the engrams of forgotten memories became implemented more deeply within bilateral hippocampus, while consciously accessible memories were neocorticalized overnight. The engrams of both consciously accessible and inaccessible (forgotten) memories shifted from the 30-minute to the 24-hour memory test within the right hippocampus and anterior cingulate gyrus as evidenced by the occurrence of pattern dissimilarities that supported correct retrieval responses at 24 hours. Hence, forgotten human episodic memories remain implemented in the episodic memory system and continue to influence decisions.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

With this model researchers can select a value at which they expect dissimilarity or similarity to occur and evaluate it against real similarity distributions. To demonstrate how this model works two separate proof-of-concept experimental analyses were conducted on publicly available data, the results of which are reported in this paper.

In this work we use an optogenetic tool, opto-PKR, to specifically trigger ISR-activation with light with high spatiotemporal control via the PKR-kinase, avoiding potential upstream damage or side effects from drugs. Using immunofluorescence and RNA-sequencing we show that targeted ISR-activation reaches levels where both adaptive (ATF4) and terminal response (CHOP) of the ISR are activated, which show downregulation of genes associated with extracellular environment and glial cell migration, further supported by ECM-stain and scratch assays.

G.; Lizama Valenzuela, C.; Hadley, P.; Tang, Q.; Oskowitz, A.", "abstract": "Background: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), a chronic inflammatory condition with few treatment options for patients with early-stage disease. Treg therapy for AAA is potentially beneficial but its specific mechanism requires further investigation for clinical applications. Methods: After identifying the critical role of T-cells in AAA using human and mouse AAA single-cell RNA sequencing data, we investigated the influence of Tregs on immune cell infiltration within mouse AAA-specifically CD3+ T cells-using congenic transfer of Thy1.1 allelic donor mice Tregs into AAA-induced wild-type C57BL/6J mice. AAA progression was quantified with ultrasound and image micrometry. Tissues obtained on postoperative days 7-42 were analyzed with flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, Verhoeff-van Gieson staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. Results: CD3+ T cell population was profoundly elevated in the elastase induced AAA mouse model which was further used in the study. The AAA mice that received Treg cell therapy had less elastin degradation and aortic wall enlargement than their control counterparts. Donor Tregs were detected in draining lymph nodes even after five weeks, with characteristic expression of FOXP3 and CD25. Although donor Tregs were not detected in the aortic microenvironment, the pro-inflammatory cell population including CD4 and CD8 cells was reduced, compared to control mice. Conclusion: Elevated T cell population aggravates inflammation and promotes AAA progression. Treg therapy impedes the recruitment of T cells into AAA tissue by colonizing the draining lymph nodes, thereby mitigating AAA progression. This study deepens our understanding of Treg stability, function, and potential as a promising therapy for early-stage aneurysms.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

We systematically investigated the effects of PMI on relaxation times, depending on tissue characteristics, in both unfixed and fixed pig brains. Methods: Twelve pig brains (n = 12) were scanned in both unfixed and fixed states at three PMI windows ({approx}12, 24, 48 h). Quantitative T1, T2, and T2* maps were acquired with identical protocols at controlled room temperature (~24 {degrees}C). We assessed the PMI effects on relaxation times in the gray matter (GM) and the white matter (WM) at both group and sample levels, while fixation-induced effects and inter-sample variability were evaluated using pairwise rank correlation and coefficient of variation (CV) visualization. Results: In unfixed tissues, T1 significantly differed among PMI groups in GM (p = 0.0141) and WM (p = 0.0315) in the early window ([&le;] 24 h). In the same window, PMIT1 correlations were observed in both GM (r = 0.921, p = 0.007) and WM (r = 0.876, p = 0.013). T2 showed no group differences but exhibited an inverse correlation with PMI in WM (r = -0.849, p = 0.015). No significant PMI-T2* relationships were detected (all p > 0.05). At later PMI (20-50 h), PMI-qMRI correlations diminished. Fixation processes altered all qMRI parameters. Notably, the PMI effects on T1 in the unfixed brains were preserved even after fixation at an ordinal level, although fixation introduced substantial inter-sample variability. Conclusions: PMI exerts the most robust effects on T1. Fixation has a significant impact on qMRI values, mitigating the apparent PMI effect and increasing the inter-sample variability. However, it is still possible to retrieve the PMI effects from fixed brain at the level of rank order, providing practical guidance for further ex vivo qMRI studies on PMI.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

To ensure rigorous and reproducible effects, it is necessary to implement double-blinding to mitigate potential experimental biases. This study innovates on previous ultrasound coupling methods by embedding a 3D-printed thermoplastic disc in a high-density gel-polymer matrix to create identical gel-plastic coupling devices that either transmit (verum) or block (sham) ultrasound. Methods: We evaluated varying thicknesses (1.5 mm, 2,0 mm, 2.5 mm) and infill densities (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) for insertion loss and effects on beam characteristics across relevant human neuromodulation frequencies from 0.2 - 1 MHz. Results: ABS at 1.5mm thickness and 50% infill had the lowest insertion loss at 0.50MHz of 0.9 +/- 0.04dB demonstrating acoustic transparency suitable for a verum device. For the sham device, we introduced an internal air gap that produced 31 dB insertion loss at 0.50MHz. The verum device demonstrated minimal effects on the beam shape with a radial peak shift of 0.3 +/- 0.2mm and an average axial shift of 0.5 mm. Discussion: This novel gel-plastic coupling device can be tailored to most LIFU transducer shapes and is designed to support double-blind protocols by maintaining visual and tactile indistinguishability while controlling transmitted energy. This method provides a cost-effective and easily implementable solution for double-blinding in human LIFU studies to improve the reliability and rigor of experimental outcomes.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and pericytes isolated from peripheral blood represent superior alternatives for biobanking across three mammalian genera (Canis, Bison, and Equus). Blood-derived cells exhibited 2-3 fold faster doubling rates (15-20 hours versus >35 hours for fibroblasts) and reduced time to generate banked lines from 3-4 weeks to 1.5-2 weeks. Proteomic profiling of 32 canonical markers confirmed EPCs and pericytes represent distinct populations with lineage-specific molecular signatures. Optical genome mapping demonstrated equivalent genomic stability across all cell types with no detectable structural variants or aneuploidies. Critically, interspecific somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) experiments confirmed both EPCs and pericytes generate viable embryos with efficiency meeting or exceeding fibroblasts. Gray wolf blood-derived cells produced six viable fetuses with 15% implantation rate, while bison EPCs showed higher blastocyst formation (7%) than fibroblasts (3%) from the same individual.

J.; Fernandes, V. M.; Vasudevan, D.", "abstract": "Inherited retinal diseases are a class of genetically heterogenous disorders characterized by mutations in genes required for retinal function, resulting in progressive loss of vision in human patients. One such deletion mutation in the translation termination factor, HBS1L, results in a suite of developmental anomalies in human patients, including progressive vision loss defects. HBS1L and its interaction partner Pelota (Pelo), are required for recycling stalled ribosomes on mRNAs, but the specific mRNA target causative of vision defects seen with HBS1L deletion remains unknown. Further, the specific cell types in the visual system that require HBS1L for proper development and function are also unknown. Here, we discover that loss of the Drosophila HBS1L homolog, Hbs1, results in reduced expression of the stress responsive Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) which is encoded by an mRNA containing multiple upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its 5' leader. We corroborate these results in cultured human cells, where we find that HBS1L and Pelo promote translation reinitiation at the ATF4 ORF by facilitating proper translation termination at the preceding uORFs. Like human HBS1L deficiency patients, loss of function Drosophila mutants for Hbs1, pelo, and ATF4 show vision defects as measured by electroretinograms (ERG). Depleting Hbs1 in lamina neurons replicated the ERG defects seen in Hbs1 mutants, suggesting that Hbs1-Pelo is required for proper lamina neuron function. Further confocal analysis of Hbs1 mutants revealed vacuolization defects in the lamina layer, which are indicative of defective synapse formation between lamina neurons and photoreceptors. Strikingly, restoring ATF4 expression in the lamina partially rescued ERG defects in Hbs1 mutants, indicating that ATF4 is likely a relevant mRNA target regulated by Hbs1-Pelo in these cells. Together, our data support a model wherein Hbs1-Pelo mediated translation regulation of ATF4 in lamina neurons underlies the inherited retinal disease caused by HBS1L deletion.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

By strategically regulating the photolysis pathway, we identified chalcanthite, which primarily contains Cu2+. By conducting antibiotic susceptibility test and electron microscopy analysis, Cu2+ salts (including copper sulfate, copper chloride, and copper gluconate) were confirmed to restore the antibacterial activity of tigecycline under light exposure against all tested bacterial strains. Spectroscopic characterization combined with quantum chemical calculations elucidated the molecular mechanism by which Cu2+ selectively modulates the photolytic degradation pathway of tigecycline and structural determinants (dimethylamino groups on the D ring).

Y.-J.; Yuan, Z.-Y.; Zhou, J.", "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). As a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), hyperlipidemia is a common sequela of CKD, which is linked to increased lipid synthesis, impaired lipoprotein clearance, and maladapted reverse cholesterol transport. Because exosomes can transport miRNAs to modulate intercellular and tissue communication, we hypothesized that exosomal miRNAs can act as endocrine-like molecules to modulate the CKD-associated hyperlipidemia and ASCVD. Methods: Small RNA-seq and qPCR were used to determine the differential plasma level of exosomal miR-148a-3p in ASCVD patients with and without CKD. RNA-seq and in silico analysis were used to establish the regulation of lipid metabolism via miR-148a-3p/salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1)/AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 1 subunit (AMPK?1) in the liver. Inhibition of miR-148a-3p or overexpression of SIK1/AMPK1 in ApoE-/- mice with 5/6 nephrectomy was used to elucidate the role of the miR-148a-3p/SIK1/AMPK1 axis in CKD-related hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Results: The plasma level of exosomal miR-148a-3p was significantly elevated in patients with ASCVD and CKD (ASCVD/CKD) and ApoE-/- mice with 5/6 nephrectomy. Via circulating exosomes, kidney-generated miR-148a-3p was delivered to the liver, where it targeted SIK1/AMPK1 transcripts, thereby upregulating SREBP2/PCSK9 and reciprocally downregulating LDLR. Levels of SIK1 and AMPK1 were decreased in hepatocytes transfected with miR-148a-3p or treated with plasma exosomes from ASCVD/CKD patients, with attendant SREBP2 activation and attenuated LDL-C binding. The decreased LDL-C binding was rectified by SIK1/AMPK1 or LNA-miR-148a-3p overexpression. LNA-miR-148a-3p or AAV8-SIK1/AMPK administration in 5/6 nephrectomy/ApoE-/- mice significantly ameliorated hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Conclusion: In ASCVD/CKD patients and nephrectomy/ApoE-/- mice, kidney-originating miR-148a-3p targeted hepatic SIK1/AMPK1 mRNA. This exosome-mediated endocrine effect upregulated SREBP2/PCSK9 and reciprocally reduced LDLR level, which elevated plasma LDL-C level and exacerbated ASCVD.

Chemical modification-based RNA structure probing remains a key approach to revealing RNA structures in complex in vivo conditions. Practically, chemical modifications generate both mutation and stop signals during reverse transcription within a single experiment. However, traditional analysis pipelines often rely on only one of the two signals without fully leveraging both. Results: To address this, we developed a machine learning-based approach, STONE, that integrates both signals from a single experiment. STONE improved RNA structure analysis across multiple independent validation regions, notably 28S rRNA, viral RNA and regulatory RNAs. In genome-wide datasets, especially single-cell data, STONE significantly increased nucleotide coverage per transcript and improved gene detection reliability. In genome-wide datasets, especially single-cell data, STONE substantially enhanced structural information coverage at both transcript and nucleotide levels. This maximized signal utilization, yielding RNA structures in single-cell data comparable to those from bulk datasets. Furthermore, STONE-derived structural scores allow direct identification of RNA-binding protein binding sites directly from a single probing experiment, with results on RNAs such as U1 snRNA, RNase P RNA, and XIST lncRNA closely matching established techniques like CLIP-seq and RNP-MaP.

C-fibre ADS differs between the sexes and can regulate spinal network function. Objective: Explore the impact of methylglyoxal upon C-fibre ADS and pain sensitivity in both sexes. In addition, investigate the influence of ADS upon the processing of C-fibre inputs, in noxious heat responsive spinal neurons. Results: Compound action potential recording of isolated dorsal roots incubated with methylglyoxal (100M, 3 hr) revealed a sex-dependent impact upon C-fibre ADS. In male roots, C-fibre ADS was reduced whereas in female roots it was increased. Acute methylglyoxal application (100M/1mM, 10 min) did not modify C-fibre ADS. Systemic methylglyoxal administration (5g, 3h prior) induced heat hyperalgesia in male but not female juvenile rats.

Building on prior evidence of gene regulatory network (GRN) rewiring underpinning adaptive traits, we profiled chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and matched transcriptomes across brain, eye, liver, and testis tissues in five representative cichlid species using optimised protocols. We show extensive divergence in chromatin accessibility corresponding to phylogenetic lineages and tissue identity, with many regulatory regions exhibiting accelerated nucleotide evolution. Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) variation correlates with both chromatin accessibility and differential gene expression, particularly in genes linked to sensory systems. By integrating TF footprinting with regulatory motif turnover analyses, we demonstrate that dynamic nucleotide changes drive GRN rewiring, concordant with ecological niche and lineage-specific adaptations.

Its implementation in Rust enables high speed through parallelization while guaranteeing memory safety. Computationally, it demonstrated superior performance to conventional assembly-based methods, achieving an average speed up of 7x on short-read datasets and 5x on long-read datasets. In terms of memory footprint, it outperformed the assembly-based approaches for short-read datasets, but its memory footprint was comparable for long-read datasets. Notably, K-MARVEL accurately reconstructs functional genes from genomically fragmented evidence, providing a more comprehensive resistome assessment.

While a number of computational methods have been developed for SVG identification, their reliance on algorithm-specific assumptions, such as predefined kernel functions or spatial neighborhood graphs, often results in substantial variability in sensitivity and inflated false discovery rates (FDRs) across heterogeneous datasets. To address this challenge, we here develop Castl, an ensemble-based framework for SVG identification that integrates multiple detection methods through statistically designed aggregation modules. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that Castl consistently identifies biologically meaningful spatial expression patterns, mitigates method-specific biases and effectively controls FDRs across various biological contexts, resolutions, and spatial technologies. This flexible, assumption-free framework offers a robust and standardized foundation for spatially informed feature discovery in complex biological systems.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

{"title": "High doses of fine biochar in sandy subsoils increase water retention, but also cause first-year yield depressions for drought-stressed barley", "doi": "10.1101/2025.10.09.681326", "authors": "Bruun, E. W.; Petersen, C.; Iturbe-Espinoza, P.; Winding, A.; Muller-Stover, D.", "abstract": "Abstract Context: Coarse sandy subsoils often suffer from low water retention and rooting depth, limiting crop yields, especially under drought conditions. Aims: To determine whether high doses of fine-grained biochar (150 or 300 Mg/ha) incorporated into sandy subsoil could improve water retention, nutrient uptake, root development and yield of spring barley under drought conditions. Methods: A two-year mesocosm study (2022-2023) using soil columns containing subsoil layers of ground biochar (<80 micrometer, at 1%, 2% and 4%) or biochar pellets (2%) compared to unamended controls in two sandy soils. Key results: Ground biochar increased available water capacity while intact pellets showed no measurable effect. First-year (2022) biochar applications negatively affected plant growth and nitrogen (N) uptake, likely due to N immobilization. Second-year (2023) results showed neutral to positive yield effects following winter irrigation. Biochar addition did not improve phosphorus uptake, despite the creation of wetter subsoils enriched with P. Root density decreased with increasing biochar concentration especially in one soil type, possibly due to increased potassium levels. Rooting depth was unaffected and greater than under field conditions. Conclusions: Biochar incorporation into sandy subsoils can improve water retention, but may cause temporary N immobilization, affecting first-year crop performance. Overall benefits may emerge in subsequent growing seasons. Implications: Long-term field trials are needed to assess nutrient management strategies, including additional N-application the first year. Incorporating biochar in autumn may help avoid N immobilization before spring sowing. Field-scale methods for applying fine-grained biochar to sandy subsoil must be developed.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

This underscores the critical need for effective intervention methods tailored to the needs of individuals with ASD. Non-human primate models offer a promising avenue for elucidating the intricate interplay between ASD characteristics and developing individualized therapeutic strategies. This study examined the activity levels and behavioral dynamics in a prenatal valproic acid-induced (VPA) common marmoset model of ASD using ultraminiature data loggers, employing a more detailed approach to behavioral pattern analysis than is traditionally utilized. Although the overall activity levels showed no significant differences, the VPA group exhibited increased activity during specific hours, which is consistent with human ASD studies. Sample Entropy, a statistical measure used to quantify the regularity and unpredictability of time-series data, was higher during daytime in the VPA group, indicating reduced regularity in activity patterns akin to impulsive behavior in ASD. Subtle patterns that were not discernible through simple group comparisons were identified, highlighting the potential of this method as a valuable tool for the behavioral analysis of human ASD. Associations between erratic activity patterns, brief resting intervals, and elevated cortisol levels were observed, all of which correspond to stress phenotypes in individuals with ASD. The findings revealed variations in activity among the adult VPA groups, potentially linked to stress responses. Additionally, VPA juvenile marmosets showed increased locomotor activity in the social interaction test, complementing the adult behavioral findings and suggesting age-dependent manifestations of hyperactivity in this model. This non-human primate model effectively replicates real-world scenarios encountered by individuals with ASD exhibiting hyperactivity, thus holding significant implications for the advancement of personalized therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

However, how filopodial actin filaments are locally produced, organized, and maintained remains unclear. The transmembrane protein PLPPR3 induces filopodia in neurons and other cells. We find that the intracellular domain (ICD) of PLPPR3 forms liquid condensates, which exhibit strong co-partitioning of actin monomers. These condensates promote actin polymerization within the condensates at the expense of actin monomers in the environment, consistent with thermodynamic coupling of actin partitioning and polymerization, which we recapitulate in a modified polymerization kinetics model. This mechanism requires favorable actin partitioning into the condensate relative to the environment. Using crosslinking mass spectrometry, we identify a WH2-like actin-affinity domain within the PLPPR3 ICD. Deleting this domain lowers actin partitioning in vitro and decreases filopodia formation in vivo. Our findings establish a previously unrecognized mechanism for actin network remodeling, in which condensates act as actin sinks, locally boosting monomer concentrations and facilitating polymerization of actin filaments.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

We have investigated connections between Hippo signaling and the transcriptional co-repressor Atrophin. We find that Atrophin modulates Hippo signaling outputs in the developing Drosophila wing and does so in distinct ways in different regions. Near the dorsal-ventral boundary, loss of Atrophin leads to upregulation of targets of the Hippo pathway transcription factor Yorkie. This is explained by impairment of Notch signaling, and consequent downregulation of Vestigial, which normally competes with Yorkie for binding to Scalloped. In proximal regions of the wing disc, loss of Atrophin leads to downregulation of Yorkie activity. This is explained by downregulation of Dachs, as Dachs inhibits Warts, the central kinase controlling Yorkie activity. Downregulation of Dachs is explained by modulation of its upstream regulators Dachsous and Four-jointed, which is explained in turn by our discovery that Atrophin interacts genetically and physically with Vestigial and competes with Scalloped for Vestigial binding. These studies define new roles for Atrophin and enhance our understanding of the interplay of transcriptional activators and repressors that modulate Hippo signaling to shape wing development.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Editosome, mediating RNA editing, comprises nuclear-encoded factors, primarily including pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR), multiple organelle RNA editing factor (MORF), organelle RNA recognition motif-containing (ORRM), and organelle zinc finger (OZ) proteins. However, the origin, evolution, and diversification of these editing factors largely remain enigmatic. Here, we analyze 364 high-quality proteomes spanning Archaeplastida to identify 212,779 PPR, 2,759 MORF, 7,760 ORRM and 829 OZ proteins, and chart their evolutionary landscapes. We find that PPR genes in terrestrial plants undergo substantial expansions, mainly driven by dispersed duplication and retroposition. Further analysis shows that DYW subgroup PPR genes, encoding RNA-editing enzymes, are largely transferred from plants to rotifers, potentially enhancing ultraviolet irradiation resistance of these recipients. Meanwhile, we find that MORF proteins, accessory factors of PPR proteins, are restricted to seed plants. Notably, their hallmark MORF domains share sequence and structural similarity with peptidase S8 propeptide/proteinase inhibitor I9 domains that mediate pro-enzyme folding, implying MORFs regulate PPR folding. Additionally, we reclassify MORF, ORRM, and OZ proteins based on domain architecture, revealing hallmark domain fusions occur among them and with PPR proteins, except between MORF and OZ.

Its ecological flexibility enables it to thrive in various habitats, including urban areas, raising concerns about its potential role in spreading zoonotic diseases. Jackals may act as reservoirs for pathogens such as Lyme disease and babesiosis, affecting wildlife, humans, and pets. Their close genetic relationship with domestic dogs also increases the risk of hybridization and host-jumping, complicating disease dynamics. To better understand their dispersal ability and host-pathogen dynamics, we present the first chromosome-level genome assembly of the golden jackal, generated using PacBio HiFi sequencing and reference-based scaffolding. The final assembly has a total length of 2.53 Gb in 325 scaffolds, with 98.41% of the sequence anchored to the expected 38+XY chromosomes. The assembly shows high contiguity, with scaffold and contig N50 values of 68.03 Mb and 56.64 Mb, respectively. Annotation revealed 26,084 protein-coding genes, and repetitive elements account for 40.58% of the total assembly. This high-quality reference genome provides an essential resource for studying the genetic basis of the golden jackal's adaptation, ecological interactions, and potential as a zoonotic reservoir. It also supports efforts to monitor population expansion and its effects on ecosystems.

The aim of our study was to investigate how a weekly increase in the intake of a well-characterized pea protein isolate affects surrogate markers of health, fecal short-chain fatty acids and gut microbiota composition in healthy individuals. Male and female adults (N=29) participated in this exploratory intervention study. A 4-week pre-intervention period for questionnaires and fecal samples collection was followed by a 4-week supplementation. Participants consumed isolated pea protein in weekly increasing amounts, starting from 0.25 g/kg body mass/day in week 5 to 1.00 g/kg body mass/day in week 8. Questionnaire data, fecal samples as well as fasting blood and 24-h urine samples were collected weekly. Data from biological samples and questionnaires confirmed a healthy study population and compliance. Fecal calprotectin levels significantly increased only in a subset of participants, which was also accompanied by higher fecal water cytotoxicity in vitro. Short-chain fatty acids mainly rose in those subjects with stable calprotectin levels. Relative abundances of Limosilactobacillus frumenti, Odoribacter splanchnicus and Lactobacillus crispatus increased significantly in the total population during the intervention while the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum decreased.

Here, we introduce Serval, which is a modular framework for evaluating and comparing decoding methods in spatial transcriptomics. Serval separates key decoding stages into independently configurable modules, enabling flexible integration of alternative algorithms. Using the Serval framework we develop a novel decoding method that improves transcript recovery by optimizing the cosine similarity to known barcodes. To evaluate performance under controlled conditions, we developed a photorealistic multiplexed spot simulator that generates MERFISH-like images with ground-truth labels. Using both simulated and real datasets, including cultured cells and tumor sections, we show that the new cosine decoder achieves higher correlation with bulk and single-cell RNA-seq references compared to existing methods.

In this study, we introduce a hybrid SEIR-FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model that integrates epidemiological dynamics with neuronal excitability to describe the flow of information through complex brain-like networks. Each node follows FHN excitability with slow recovery, while inter-node coupling obeys a modified SEIR process that regulates transmission probability based on exposure and recovery. This hybridization allows for the coexistence of oscillatory neural states and infection-like spreading modes, representing fast spiking communication constrained by population-level fatigue. We simulate the hybrid model across ring, Erdos-Renyi, and Barabasi-Albert topologies and benchmark it against conventional diffusive FHN and FHN with synaptic depression (STD). Information-theoretic analysis using Mutual Information (MI) and Transfer Entropy (TE) shows that the hybrid system sustains higher directional information flow (TE-AUROC {approx} 0.52-0.54) and reduced latency across topologies. These results suggest that infection-inspired coupling enhances causal coherence and efficiency of information propagation in neural networks.

G.", "abstract": "Abstract: Epidemiological data links lack of breastfeeding with increased risk of breast cancer. Breast tissue undergoes remodeling to pre-pregnancy state after birth through involution. Long-term breastfeeding leads to gradual involution (GI). Lack of breastfeeding leads to abrupt involution (AI). While estrogen impacts repopulation of adipocytes, AI causes several precancerous changes in the mouse mammary gland. The impact of AI on adipocyte repopulation and metabolism is yet to be elucidated. Objectives: To investigate effects of AI on mammary gland metabolism and its potential link to breast cancer. Methods: At partum (day 0), FVB/n dams were randomized to AI or GI and standardized to 6 pups. AI mice had pups removed on day 7 postpartum to mimic short-term breastfeeding. GI mice had 3 pups each were removed on day 28 and 31 postpartum to mimic gradual weaning. Mammary glands were harvested on day 28, 56, and 120 postpartum. Subset of AI mice had long-term sustained release tamoxifen placed subscapular on day 8 postpartum. Metabolic changes were assessed using: 1) transcriptional; 2) functional; 3) oxidative stress; and 4) metabolites analysis. Results: Day 28 GI glands sustains/continues milk synthesis pathways impacting metabolic comparison with day28 AI glands. Day 28 AI when compared to day 56 GI showed upregulation of estrogen signaling, neutrophil degranulation, glucose metabolism, RNA synthesis, and down regulation of adipogenesis and glycolysis. At day 120, AI glands had downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and upregulation of mitochondria dysfunction similar to pregnancy associated estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. Tamoxifen treatment of AI dams showed metabolic pathways and estrogen signaling similar to that of GI glands on day 28. Conclusion: Early metabolic phenotypes in AI and GI glands may be caused by differences in adipocyte repopulation related to estrogen signaling.

In our study, candidates involved in drug resistance are chosen based on cell line validation (overexpression or downregulation or inhibition of candidates) studies, curated manually. Method 28,773 mRNA expression signatures from 914 breast cancer patients were extracted from cProsite. 106 of these patients had clinical information and log2 fold change information required for this study. We categorized these patients into deceased and surviving groups from TCGA. To prepare a database that can predict drug resistance and overall survival, we included mRNAs that were over-expressed in at least 80% of the breast cancer patients and mRNAs over-expressed in deceased and surviving groups. In addition, we also reported breast cancer-associated drug resistance candidates which have been reported in cell-line based studies. The database matrix preparation involved an approximate of 15000 manual searches of cell validated studies. (750 candidates x 20 drugs). The database was validated using a publicly available breast cancer patient proteomics data. Results Our analysis identified a list of top priority candidates associated with multidrug resistance, categorized based on their resistance to >15 drugs, 5-15 drugs, and 2-4 drugs.

Methods: We developed an isogenic cell line-derived xenograft model to perform transcriptome-wide analyses of trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant tumors. To validate key findings, we employed a 3D cancer-immune co-culture system capable of quantifying antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Results: Transcriptomic profiling revealed how trastuzumab treatment shifts tumor transcriptomes, including changes that remodel the metabolic landscape and distinct gene signatures associated with resistance, notably the upregulation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). Functional studies demonstrated that PFKFB3 promotes trastuzumab resistance by inducing metabolic rewiring and reducing ADCC. Silencing PFKFB3 restored immune-mediated cytotoxicity. Clinical dataset analyses confirmed that elevated PFKFB3 expression correlates with reduced overall and progression-free survival, and with incomplete pathological response to trastuzumab.

J.; Dusterhoft, S.; Muller-Newen, G.", "abstract": "The somatic V617F mutation in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 (JAK2VF) causes various phenotypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). By interacting with cytokine receptors such as those for erythropoietin (EPO) or thrombopoietin (TPO), JAK2VF induces ligand-independent dimerization and activation, leading to deregulated blood cell production, cytokine hypersensitivity, and inflammatory cytokine release. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key mediator of inflammatory symptoms in MPN, signals via homodimers of the gp130 receptor. We investigated whether JAK2VF alters gp130 dimerization and IL-6 sensitivity. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the JAK2VF pseudokinase domain forms more stable dimers than wild-type (WT) JAK2, potentially supporting gp130 tetramerization. In cell-based assays, IL-6 stimulation of JAK2VF+ cells induced stronger STAT3 activation than in JAK2-WT cells, reflecting enhanced IL-6 sensitivity. Moreover, JAK2VF expression elevated gp130 surface levels, dependent on the JAK2-binding motif in gp130. These findings indicate that JAK2VF promotes gp130 expression and dimerization, sensitizing mutant cells to IL-6. Thus, JAK2VF-driven amplification of IL-6/gp130 signaling may foster chronic inflammation and disease progression in MPN, representing a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

By combining quantitative measurements in tumors and organoids with theoretical modeling, we reveal emergent mechanical gradients that orchestrate cell state transitions during colorectal tumor growth. Compression at the tumor center induces a transition from a fetal-like state into a cancer stem cell (CSC) state. The CSC compartment exhibits a characteristic size determined by tumor rheological properties. Once this size is surpassed, a translationally arrested apoptotic core emerges, triggering a shift from homogeneous proliferation to a hierarchical cell turnover.

This relapse is frequently seeded by drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs), which persist as minimal residual disease (MRD) by adopting a reversible quiescent state and later reacquire proliferative capacity under ongoing treatment. To address this, we sought to convert quiescent DTPs into an irreversible, non-proliferative state by pharmacologically inducing senescence. Through large-scale chemical screening and combination optimization, we identified SAHA plus tilorone dihydrochloride (SIC) as a regimen that robustly induces senescence in melanoma DTPs and abolishes their proliferative potential in vitro. Mechanistically, SAHA relieves HDAC1-mediated repression of HMGA2, a key senescence driver, while tilorone synergistically inhibits autophagy to promote a fully senescent state. In a melanoma xenograft mouse model receiving MAPK-targeted therapy, SIC treatment significantly suppressed MRD progression. Importantly, SIC also induced robust senescence across diverse DTP models irrespective of tumor origin, mutational background, or prior treatment. Collectively, these findings provide proof-of-concept that converting DTPs from reversible quiescence to permanent senescence represents an effective strategy to prevent relapse under targeted therapy and position SIC as a broadly applicable pharmacological approach for durable control of residual disease in advanced cancers.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Results & conclusion: During tumor progression, DNA methylation of oligodendrogliomas changed along a continuum. This continuum is linked to increased epigenetic aging, methylation of transcription factors and Ki-67+ cell density, and to large scale DNA demethylation. Demethylation was correlated with CpGs flanking sequences preferred by TET enzymes. We confirmed these findings in previously profiled astrocytomas, indicating IDH-mutant gliomas progress along a shared epigenetic axis. We developed an objective DNA methylation based prognostic continuous grading coefficient (CGC{psi}) that captured these changes and outperformed WHO grading for oligodendrogliomas.

While oxidative stress and its pathological outcomes are well studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular responses to reductive stress remain poorly understood. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we investigate thiol reductive stress induced by dithiothreitol (DTT) and uncover a critical protective role for the hypoxia response pathway. We identify RHY-1, a membrane-associated acyltransferase and known negative regulator of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1, as essential for survival under thiol reductive stress. Notably, rhy-1 is a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1, and overexpression of rhy-1 fully rescues the sensitivity of hif-1 loss-of-function mutants to DTT. We demonstrate that RHY-1 functions in an autoinhibitory feedback loop, where elevated RHY-1 levels suppress activation of the hypoxia response pathway even during reductive stress. Finally, we show that RHY-1 physically interacts with CYSL-1, a cysteine synthase-like protein and positive regulator of HIF-1, and likely inhibits its function through this interaction.

To delineate isomer-specific responses in Arabidopsis thaliana at the systems level, we have combined a comparative proteomics and electrophysiological approaches. Both isomers cause distinct systemic effects on the proteome, with the 2',3' isomer notably affecting systems-level functions like transcriptional regulation. None of the isomers affects net ion fluxes in the root under control conditions, but both were able to attenuate the magnitude of oxidative stress-induced K+ net loss and Ca2+ uptake by 2-fold. Isomer-specific responses of single molecular targets were assessed in the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels 2 and 18 (CNGC2 and CNGC18).

P.", "abstract": "Efficient axonal transport is essential for maintaining neuronal function, enabling the bidirectional delivery of diverse cargoes between the cell body and distal compartments. In the neuromuscular system, neurotrophic factors (NTFs) regulate motor neuron survival, function, and synaptic connectivity, in part, through retrograde trafficking of activated NTF-receptor complexes from the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to the cell body. We recently demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulation to muscles selectively enhances retrograde transport of signalling endosomes in fast, but not slow, motor neurons in vivo. Moreover, both axonal endosome transport and its BDNF-mediated regulation are disrupted in mouse models of diseases impacting motor neurons. Here, we examined whether additional NTFs, when applied to distal axon terminals, share this transport-modulating property. Through imaging sciatic nerves in anaesthetised mice, we tracked the in vivo dynamics of signalling endosomes in fast (FMN) and slow motor neurons (SMN) via intramuscular injections of a fluorescently conjugated, atoxic fragment of tetanus neurotoxin (HCT). HCT was co-administered with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neurturin (NRTN), or proBDNF - four growth factors with known effects on motor neurons. Compared to vehicle-treated controls, HGF, NRTN, and proBDNF produced no detectable change in transport dynamics. In contrast, CNTF markedly reduced endosome speeds in both FMNs and SMNs, indicating remarkable selectivity of specific NTFs in the regulation of signalling endosome transport in motor neurons. Understanding this selectivity may aid the development of muscle-targeted NTF-based therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring axonal transport in neurodegenerative disease, peripheral neuropathy, and nerve injury.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Moreover, our detailed analysis suggests a spatiotemporal transition of EBV latency programs, with distinct viral gene expression patterns corresponding to specific tissue microenvironments- a dynamic process previously inferred but not directly mapped in human tissues. We found that cells expressing the EBV-encoded protein LMP1 form an immunosuppressive niche that is rich in IDO1+PDL1+ macrophages and relatively depleted of T-cells. Furthermore, the T-cells that do infiltrate LMP1+ regions exhibit signatures consistent with an activated and cytotoxic phenotype, providing new insights into how LMP1 shapes immune evasion.

Specifically, eATP-P2RY2 signaling serves as the primary upstream driver of COX-1/2 upregulation and consequent accumulation of immunosuppressive PGE2; in the TME, uncovering the long-sought TME-specific trigger of pathological COX-PGE2; hyperactivation in solid tumors. Genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of P2RY2 eliminates both baseline and therapy-induced intratumoral PGE2;, restores antitumor T cell responses, and reverses resistance to CAR-T, TCR-T, checkpoint blockade, and TIL therapies.

Immunity against this virus has been studied since the discovery of EBV in the 1960s, and although important insights have been made, no unbiased, global studies of immune responses to EBV in healthy seropositive subjects have been reported. Here we describe a novel protocol to study the cellular immune response to EBV, detecting lymphocytes that respond to EBV via analyses of proliferation or induced expression of activation markers and cytokines. Using this system we sequenced, for the first time at a single-cell level, the transcriptome of all cells capable of responding to EBV in healthy individuals and in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) associated with susceptibility to EBV infection. Lymphocyte cytotoxicity appears to be crucial for the proper control of EBV-infection, while a proportionate T-regulatory cell response likely helps to avoid excessive immunity and immune pathology. We also show that {gamma}{delta} T cells expressing the TCR V{delta}1 chain use various activating natural killer (NK) cell receptors to recognise and kill EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and thus could be a promising candidate for allogeneic cell therapy for EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with either primary or secondary immunodeficiencies.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

We here evaluate gDNA quality and quantity before and after HotSHOT treatment of 11 insect families representing six orders. Some specimens were flash frozen immediately after collection, while others were kept for one week at tropical temperatures in ethanol to mimic Malaise trap conditions. Encouragingly, we show that gDNA of sufficiently high quality and quantity for genomic sequencing remained in specimens treated with HotSHOT. We also show that DNA integrity was strongly influenced by field storage with specimens exposed to Malaise trap conditions showing such pronounced degradation that the standard HotSHOT treatment no longer significantly altered DNA quality. For control material, HotSHOT treatments involving longer exposure to high temperature led to smaller fragment lengths with the effect apparently being influenced by the degree of specimen sclerotization. Our results thus suggest that optimized HotSHOT treatments, together with carefully controlled pre-extraction storage, preserve voucher gDNA of sufficient quality for downstream genomic analyses with both short-read and possibly even some long-read sequencing technologies.

It plays a critical role in organizing the molecular structure and function of synapses by clustering at the postsynaptic density (PSD), where it anchors neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and signaling enzymes. These clusters form a dynamic nanodomain molecular platform that is essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity. Disruption of PSD95 clustering affects synaptic organization and is involved in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Palmitoylation, a reversible post-translational modification involving the addition of a palmitate group to specific Cysteine residues, has been experimentally linked to PSD95 membrane localization and clustering. However, the structural and mechanistic basis of this process remains poorly understood. Using a multiscale molecular dynamics approach that combines all-atom and coarse-grained simulations, we investigated how palmitoylation influences the conformational dynamics, membrane association, and self-assembly of PSD95. Our simulations reveal that palmitoylation induces PSD95 to adopt and maintain an open conformation in solution as well as stabilizes its assembly-primed extended configuration when bound to the membrane. Specifically, in the unmodified state, the N-terminal PDZ1 domain remains distal to the membrane, while PDZ2 preferentially engages with it. Palmitoylation flips this arrangement and anchors PDZ1 to the membrane, thereby promoting an extended configuration conducive to protein-protein interactions and clustering. We also find that membrane lipid composition modulates this behavior. Simulations with complex synaptic membranes compared to POPC-only membranes suggest that negatively charged lipids influence domain orientation through electrostatic interactions, working in combination with palmitoylation to shape PSD95 conformational space. Finally, coarse-grained simulations show that palmitoylated PSD95 molecules can stably associate on the membrane surface, whereas unmodified molecules fail to form persistent dimers.

However, the role played by direct and membrane-mediated interactions between M proteins and their interactions with other proteins in the clustering process remains unclear.

Using all-atom MD simulations we were able to estimate the membrane thinning induced by M proteins and the resulting membrane-mediated M-M interaction. Combining this with a continuum model that describes the evolution of M protein density in a planar lipid membrane, we identified the existence of a critical, direct M-M interaction energy needed for cluster assembly at a given density. By comparing the model predictions with analysis of atomic force microscopy images of M protein clusters in supported lipid bilayers, we were able to estimate the direct M-M interaction energy and found it to be significantly larger than the membrane mediated interaction energy.

CTP hydrolysis then releases ParB from DNA for recycling. This discovery uncovered a new regulatory principle, but the broader diversity of proteins employing a CTPase mechanism remains unclear.

While many ParB-like proteins follow the canonical ParABS organization with ParA partners, we also identify numerous orphan homologs encoded outside of the parAB operon, frequently linked to mobile genetic elements that may have driven their rapid diversification. The ParB-CTPase folds in these divergent proteins are often fused to lineage-specific domains with diverse predicted biological activities. We further demonstrate that while many homologs retain CTP-binding, others instead bind ATP or GTP, revealing a broader spectrum of nucleotide specificities than previously appreciated.

Using complex logic gates, receptor-activator networks, and signaling systems with non-linear, non-monotonic functions (e.g., x2, x3), we show that topological compensation preserves biocomputational function across temperatures up to 0.1-50 {degrees}C, despite dissociation constant changes of up to nine orders of magnitude. This mechanism also stabilizes systems against dramatic ionic strength shifts (e.g., Na +; from 0.1-1 M). Thus, topological compensation is a unique homeostasis mechanism that may be used by delicate biological systems of arbitrarily high complexity.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Many cytoplasmic RNA viruses also harbor poly(A) tails on their genomic RNA and mRNAs. Here, we report that coronavirus infection causes cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) activity to become limiting, which preferentially destabilizes short-tailed host mRNAs, occurring before the action of virally encoded mRNA-decay factor nsp1. In this environment hostile to poly(A) tails, viral RNAs maintain a narrow tail-length distribution centering on 70- 80 nucleotides across infection cycles. They do this through two mechanisms. First, viral tails are extended during RNA synthesis within double-membrane vesicles; second, viral tails are capped by a complex that includes PABPC1 and CSDE1 and slows tail shortening. Our findings suggest poly(A)-tail length is an arena of host-virus conflict, in which preserving tail lengths of viral mRNAs promotes their cytoplasmic dominance.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Temporal features of Ca2+ dynamics, including oscillation frequency, are hypothesized to encode information, allowing cells to discriminate between relevant and stochastic signals. However, the mechanisms of frequency decoding and their transcriptional consequences remain incompletely understood. To address this, we investigated how defined Ca2+ oscillation frequencies are translated into signaling cascades and gene expression programs in human non-excitable cells. Using optogenetic control of melanopsin-mediated Ca2+ influx, we induced slow (8 mHz) or fast (15 mHz) oscillations with identical single-pulse kinetics to isolate the effect of frequency. We found that TNF and IL8 transcription via NFkB displayed sigmoidal frequency dependence, strictly requiring regular periodic stimulation, while random or low-frequency inputs with equal cumulative Ca2+ exposure were ineffective. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a MYC-centered transcriptional response, with 116 of 215 differentially expressed genes predicted as MYC targets, despite unchanged MYC mRNA levels. Label-free phosphoproteomics identified PRKDC, CHEK2 and ATM as the top upstream kinases, forming a network linking Ca2+ oscillations to cell cycle and stress signaling. These findings demonstrate that cells can decode Ca2+ oscillation frequency through a multi-kinase network that tunes transcription via NFkB and MYC, providing mechanistic insight into how temporal dynamics of second messengers shape cellular decision-making.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

In agricultural landscapes, soil is managed for production and therefore frequently subjected to disturbances such as ploughing. The impacts of ploughing on flying insects that spend part of their life cycle belowground remain largely unknown. To investigate the effects of ploughing on ground-nesting flying insects, we conducted a two-year field experiment in flower strips subjected to different treatments, ranging from annual ploughing to four years without ploughing. Insects emerging from the soil were sampled using emergence traps, allowing a direct assessment of their response to ploughing at different frequencies. For each treatment, we measured insect biomass, abundance, and body size. We found that ploughing substantially reduced flying insect biomass. When sites were left unploughed, biomass increased rapidly, particularly during the first years of recovery. However, regardless of the time since the last disturbance, ploughing always reduced insect biomass to similarly low levels, driven primarily by declines in the abundance of large insects. Our findings highlight that even moderate reductions in ploughing frequency, for example, only every second year, can benefit ground-nesting flying insects and point to the potential for incorporating reduced ploughing frequencies into agricultural management and agri-environmental schemes.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Drosophila prolongata offers an exceptional opportunity to explore the evolution of trait exaggeration, as it is the only species in the melanogaster species group with male-specific foreleg size exaggeration under both intra- and intersexual selection. Here, we used sex-specific RNA-seq from fore- and midleg tissues during early development and after initiation of sexually dimorphic growth between these tissues in D. prolongata. We also sampled the same developmental stages in D. carrolli (~4MYA divergence) and D. melanogaster (~20MYA). Using comparisons of gene expression between sexes, species, tissues, and developmental stages, we found a positive relationship between the number, but not the magnitude of differential expression of sex-biased genes, with the extent of phenotypic dimorphism. One gene with a large effect, grain, caused D. prolongata-like leg size phenotypes in D. melanogaster legs when knocked down. We further found only modest changes to magnitude and direction of expression differences in signalling pathways previously implicated in sexually dimorphic evolution. This suggests that these pathways regulating trait expression and dimorphism but may not be primary drivers of their phenotypic evolution.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

These dynamics are central to predicting how species will respond to environmental change, particularly climate-driven shifts in plant phenology. The winter moth (Operophtera brumata) relies on synchronising larval egg hatch with leaf budburst of deciduous trees, yet whether they are locally adapted to their hosts' phenology, and their capacity to track future change, remains unclear. Here, we investigated potential small-scale local adaptation of winter moths to oak tree phenology in Wytham Woods, UK, a 385-hectare woodland, within which oak budburst can vary by up to three weeks within a given year. We conducted laboratory temperature manipulation experiments using 76 clutches across six temperature treatments, and field translocation experiments using over 200 clutches. We combined these experiments with assessment of population structure from whole-genome sequencing of 59 individuals. This integrative approach allowed us to assess local adaptation in terms of phenotypic differences, fitness consequences, and genetic evidence. Temperature manipulations revealed systematic differences in the timing of egg hatching across temperature treatments at the clutch level which were linked to carry-over effects from the mother's emergence time, but unrelated to their source tree budburst timing. Field translocation experiments further showed no significant differences in survival of individuals transplanted to trees with phenology differing from their original host tree, and there was no genetic structure across the population. Together, these results reveal consistent differences in hatching phenology despite the absence of population structure, strong selection, or accordance with relative tree phenology. Our findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms maintaining close synchrony in trophic interactions at small scales, which may drive spatial variation in evolutionary responses to future climate change.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

D.; Gontjes, K. J.; Snitkin, E. S.; Smith, S.

With each new evolutionary model, our ability to estimate ancestral states has improved alongside the increased biological realism of these models. However, the field has primarily relied on reconstructions that focus on individual nodes, known as marginal reconstructions. This framework is analytically tractable but may not accurately represent what biologists want in inference, as evolution is dependent, and phenotypic transitions deeper in time can lead to consistent changes later. We argue that evolutionary history is better represented by joint reconstructions, which estimate the full sequence of states across nodes. Traditionally, joint reconstruction algorithms only estimated the single most likely sequence, but here we develop novel algorithms to estimate all relevant ancestral histories efficiently and provide tools to quantify the uncertainty of joint ASR. Furthermore, through simulations and an empirical case study, we demonstrate that joint reconstructions have higher accuracy than their marginal counterparts, and that the uncertainty surrounding the best joint reconstruction can be biologically meaningful and summarized using novel clustering algorithms. We apply our methods to epidemic multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and find that the evolution of antibiotic resistance is not a single narrative but a series of competing histories. Each of these histories exhibits distinct phenotype-genotype transitions that traditional approaches would struggle to identify, yet have critical implications for predicting resistance evolution.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Two carbapenemase-encoding isolates were recovered from rectal swabs in Ireland in 2024 and were initially identified as Phytobacter by MALDI-ToF. Whole-genome sequencing with in silico species typing (dDDH, ANI) provided definitive taxonomic resolution. A genus-wide maximum-likelihood core-genome phylogeny was reconstructed, and the plasmidome and resistome were bioinformatically profiled across all available Phytobacter genomes. Phenotypic susceptibility of the Irish isolates was determined through minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing. The Irish isolates (P. diazotrophicus E787336 and P. ursingii E980862) are the first reported Phytobacter strains carrying both plasmid-borne blaIMP-4 and mcr-9.1 in the genus. MIC testing confirmed resistance to aztreonam, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and the {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor combination piperacillin-tazobactam. Across 34 Phytobacter genomes examined, 22 distinct plasmid replicon types were identified in 22 isolates, often shared across species. The genus-wide resistome encompassed 71 genes, more than half predicted to be acquired, with carbapenemases detected in 26.5% (9/34) of the genomes. In summary,Phytobacter harbors a diverse, plasmid-borne resistome including carbapenemases, with documented cases of human colonization and infection.

Integrated analyses resolved seven malignant meta-programs, including a rare Wnt/{beta}-catenin-driven melanocytic state and a de-differentiated neural crest-like state enriched in non-responders. Spatial modeling revealed that homotypic clustering stabilizes resistant programs, with neural crest-like cells forming compact, centrally localized niches, whereas Wnt/{beta}-catenin subpopulations displayed a bimodal architecture, either cohesive clusters sustained by adhesion or dispersed, transcriptionally plastic cells. Responders exhibited progressive enrichment of an antigen presentation/interferon program and coordinated remodeling of the tumor microenvironment with T and B cell expansion, whereas tumors from non-responder patients maintained stable composition of neural crest-like clusters. Epigenetic therapy reactivated transposable elements, providing both regulatory signals that prime innate immunity within microenvironment and generating antigens that drive immunoediting and immunogenicity of Antigen presentation/interferon cell states in responders. Finally, NFATC2 emerged as a master regulator of neural crests-like transcriptional phenotypes and promoter of resistance to therapeutic interventions in melanoma patients. NFATC2 perturbation was able to shift tumor cells towards more differentiated and immunogenic states.

However, how mechanical instability arises in lamellipodia, along with the functional role of dynamic instability in mechanosensing, is poorly understood. Here, we develop a minimal mechanochemical model for lamellipodia dynamics that integrates membrane deformation, myosin contractility, and binding kinetics of adhesion molecules (molecular clutches). Through stochastic simulations and analytical mean-field analysis, we demonstrate that both force-loading rate and magnitude applied by myosin-driven retrograde flow mediate the clutch binding kinetics, governing lamellipodial stability and hence the mechanosensing. Specifically, a slow force loading rate allows the clutches to bind and traction to accumulate, while a high loading magnitude collapses the bound clutches, causing protrusion-retraction cycles (instability) in lamellipodia. Our model predicts that a stiffer substrate stabilizes the lamellipodia by increasing the force loading rate, consistence with previous experiments. Furthermore, our model predictions on the biphasic regulation effect of myosin perturbations have been quantitatively validated by experimental results.

A data-driven analysis of carbohydrate metabolism, cellular respiration/fermentation, and amino acid pathways revealed that antagonistic effects were more prevalent than synergistic ones in both roots and shoots. Notably higher gene expression levels during hypoxia-salt of sucrose biosynthesis (consistent with salt), sucrose synthase (SUS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP, consistent with hypoxia) indicate enhanced sucrose and trehalose metabolism. The parallel down-regulation of invertase genes (consistent with hypoxia) suggests strategic carbon flux redistribution for optimized energy supply. Under hypoxic conditions, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression was up-regulated, indicating active lactate fermentation rather than ethanol production via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Enhanced proline synthesis under combined stress suggests improved osmoprotection. These insights into transcriptional reprogramming under single and combined hypoxia-salt conditions emphasize the intricate regulatory strategies plants utilize to manage concurrent stressors, showcasing their ability to adapt and develop stress resilience.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

C.; Thetter-Duerr, S.; Bibermair, J.; Wollesen, T.", "abstract": "Background To cope with strong and rapidly changing water currents, some marine invertebrates have evolved complex adhesive mechanisms that involve the interplay of different biomolecules, such as carbohydrates. Carbohydrates may, however, also be involved in other physiological processes such as reproduction, a research field poorly studied in protostomes. The benthic chaetognath Spadella cephaloptera is a protandric hermaphrodite capable of rapid attachment and detachment to substrates. Nevertheless, the putative underlying glycobiology during the adhesion process but also other physiological processes remain unknown for chaetognaths. Methods In the present study, through histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural analysis, we characterized the location of different glycans in the reproductive and attachment systems of S. cephaloptera. Developmental changes of adhesive cells were investigated from early hatchlings up to adults. Results Acidic and sulfated mucosubstances were detected in the sperm ducts, whereas mature oocytes were surrounded by a carboxylated jelly coat. The distribution of adhesive cells in S. cephaloptera shifted from anterior discrete individual cells in hatchlings to posteriorly distributed cell clusters in the adult. Moreover, we identified secretion granules enriched in fibrous content inside the adhesive cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed microtubule processes linking the adhesive cells to the intraepidermal plexus. Lectin affinity tests showed strong apical PNA binding and clear PHA-L/E and ConA signals in the adhesive cells. No evidence for a dual gland detachment system was observed. Conclusions This study provides the first glycan distribution analysis in a chaetognath, revealing the presence of carbohydrates in different structures of the reproductive system, highlighting their putative relevance during the fertilization process. Furthermore, the observed glycan moieties suggest that S. cephaloptera also combines convergently evolved features reported for other temporary attachment systems in marine invertebrates. However, S. cephaloptera also displays unique characters, such as specific ontogenetic changes occurring during early developmental stages that correspond to its feeding behavior. Our observations do not support the presence of additional gland cells mediating detachment. Finally, this work sets the framework for a molecular characterization of the reproductive and attachment systems of the enigmatic chaetognaths.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

This diversity raises fundamental questions about the evolutionary origin of motor control: do conserved spinal circuits underlie these behaviors, and how have they diverged across species. Recent studies detail spinal cell-type architecture in mammals but comparable, high-resolution atlases of the non-mammalian spinal cord are lacking. Here, we compare spinal cord cell types between fish, frogs, mice and humans, spanning ~450 million years of evolution. Across species, we define highly conserved programs of cell type specification that segregate spinal neurons into nearly identical cardinal classes during development. This contrasts with adult stages, when spinal cell-type composition selectively diverges for excitatory neuron subpopulations. Using spatial transcriptomics, we localize this species divergence to the superficial, dorsal spinal cord, where variant neuropeptide expression defines mammalian-specific cell types. The most dorsal spinal cord thus emerges as a recently evolved hub for sensory integration in mammals, a neospinal cord analogous to the neocortex.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

When applied to time-resolved brain imaging signals, they provide insights into the temporal dynamics of information processing in the brain. In particular, the temporal generalization (TG) method, where a decoder trained at one time point is tested on others, is commonly used to assess the stability of neural representations over time. However, TG performance can be ambiguous: distinct representational dynamics, such as sparse versus distributed activity, or scaling of activity versus recruitment of new units, can yield similar TG matrices. Moreover, even when generalization is strong, underlying neural representations may still be evolving in ways that TG alone fails to reveal. This ambiguity of performance profiles can mask meaningful changes in the geometry of neural representations. In this study, we use controlled simulations to demonstrate how different dynamic processes can produce indistinguishable TG profiles. To resolve these ambiguities, we propose a complementary approach based on the geometry of the learned linear coefficients. Specifically, we quantify the Rotation Angle {theta} between decision subspaces (with cosine similarity) and the Feature Density (capturing whether feature contributions are distributed or sparse). Together, these measures complement TG analyses, revealing how neural representations evolve in space and time. Beyond time-resolved decoding, our approach applies broadly to any linear model, offering a geometric perspective on representational dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Resolving this question requires methods that move beyond group averages to map individualized cortical atypicality against normative expectations. We built subject-level morphometric similarity networks in which edges quantify multivariate morphometric similarity between cortical regions. We then applied hierarchical Bayesian regression (HBR) normative models to estimate region-wise deviations from age- and sex-adjusted norms while accounting for site variation. Individuals with ASD carried a greater burden of extreme regional deviations, yet those deviations were focal and idiosyncratic rather than uniformly distributed. The spatial pattern of deviation aligned with canonical cortical hierarchies, shifting similarity toward sensory and visual poles and away from association cortex. Moreover, edge-level testing identified a sparse reconfiguration concentrated in occipito-temporal and cross-network connections. Clustering of individual deviation maps identified two robust subgroups that differ in the global sign of deviation and in their cognitive and molecular correlates. These results show that cortical atypicality in ASD is constrained by brain gradients, expressed in subgroup-specific forms, and linked to distinct biological and cognitive axes.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

A.; Muukkonen, I.; Wikman, P.", "abstract": "Selective attention enables the brain to prioritize behaviorally relevant information in complex environments, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with representational geometry analyses to investigate how selective attention reshapes neural population codes in naturalistic soundscapes. Participants attended to individual sound objects presented either among distractors from the same category (3OW) or from different categories (3OA). We observed that attention selectively attracted neural population responses toward the object-alone template. This effect, evident in the low-dimensional PCA space, likely reflects a reorganization of the underlying high-dimensional representational geometry. This geometric effect was modulated by the surrounding soundscape: in 3OW, where all sounds belonged to the same category, attentional modulation was minimal, whereas in 3OA, attended representations were drawn significantly closer to their template relative to distractors. Category-specific patterns were also evident: for speech, attentional modulation extended beyond the auditory cortex to left-lateralized language regions, whereas for instruments and animals, effects were largely confined to bilateral auditory areas, including core, belt regions and the superior temporal sulcus. Finally, the attraction effect observed was behaviorally meaningful: higher subjective ratings of attentional engagement predicted smaller distances between attended and object-alone representations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that selective attention reshapes neural population geometry in a context- and category-dependent manner, with geometric changes closely reflecting behavior.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Dysfunctional oligodendrocytes (OLs) are not able to efficiently restore myelin sheaths leading to increased axonal susceptibility to degeneration. Inhibitory cues to OL myelination have been described but strategies promoting remyelination keep failing. Recently acknowledged as key regulators of cellular fate and behavior, physical properties are emerging as novel potential targets in remyelination. Yet, the full extent of this impact is unknown. So far, the viscoelastic properties of the brain have been overlooked, with studies assuming that it only possesses an elastic behavior. Here, we engineered mechanically tunable 3D alginate hydrogels for culturing OLs. While being structurally biologically relevant, our matrices can be modelled in terms of elastic and viscoelastic properties. For the first time, we proved that, in addition to elasticity, viscoelasticity highly impacts the behavior of OLs. High stress-relaxation and shear moduli hydrogels lead to impaired differentiation, branching ability and metabolic activity of OLs, without visible effects on cellular viability. We showed that tuning alginate stress-relaxation properties while maintaining the stiffness triggers activation of mechanotransduction genes. Alterations were seen in genes involved in the focal adhesion kinase pathway as well as in the transcriptional factors Yap 1 and Taz and at the level of nuclear mechanotransduction (Hdac1). Understanding how microenvironmental cues support OL viability and myelination might lead to the design of improved therapies promoting remyelination. Our tunable hydrogels are not only relevant to study OL mechanobiology but can also function as a relevant model to test novel therapeutic interventions in remyelination context.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

The ongoing burden of disease, despite widespread vaccination with BCG, highlights the need for novel vaccines. MR1-restricted T (MR1T) cells recognize small molecules, including microbial-derived molecules, presented by the monomorphic MHC class 1-related molecule (MR1). They have both 'innate' effector capacity, allowing them to quickly respond to pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), while also having adaptive features (effector memory cell surface phenotype and selective TCR usage). Feasibility of an MR1T cell-based vaccination remains unexplored and critical to this is whether or not MR1T cells possess the capacity for immunological memory. To begin to address this question, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected at 9-weeks of age from healthy term-infants in South Africa, who had either received BCG vaccination at birth (n=10) or who had BCG vaccination delayed (n=10). MR1/5-OP-RU tetramer positive cells were sorted using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA and TCR-seq was performed. Ex-vivo MR1T cells from vaccinated infants demonstrated increased expression of type I interferon response genes consistent with a cytokine mediated response to BCG vaccination. Using the TCR clustering algorithm TCRdist3, similar TCRs were grouped together, revealing a cluster significantly enriched in BCG-vaccinated infants. This cluster exhibited elevated expression of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic genes, consistent with a recall response to prior vaccination and evidence of possible recognition of Mtb. This work provides the first step in addressing if MR1T cells demonstrate immunological memory, however, further work is needed to understand if these clonal expansions persist and possess the capacity for antigenic recall.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Using clonal analyses with null alleles, we dissected the roles of Rab-mediated trafficking to early, late, and recycling endosomes across multiple stages of circuit assembly in vivo. Our approach revealed that Rab5 and Rab11 regulated extensive and largely distinct developmental events, highlighting the pivotal roles of early endosome sorting and recycling pathways in circuit assembly.

Convergence and Extension (C&E) movements that elongate the anteroposterior axis initiate with precise timing during vertebrate gastrulation, but the mechanisms controlling their onset remain unknown. We examined this question using zebrafish embryonic explants that faithfully recapitulate C&E cell movements and their precise timing in culture, in isolation from other gastrulation movements. We determined that new transcription is required at gastrulation onset for C&E in explants and identified sulfatase modifying factor 2 (sumf2) as a candidate trigger of C&E onset. sumf2 encodes for pFGE, the paralog and inhibitor of the Formylglycine Generating Enzyme (FGE, encoded by sumf1), which is the key activator of all sulfatase enzymes. In zebrafish embryos and explants, sumf1 expression declines just as sumf2 is expressed, leading to decreased sulfatase activity and increased sulfation of their heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) substrates. We found that overexpression of sumf1 and sumf2 causes delayed or precocious C&E onset, respectively, whereas mutations in sumf1 and sumf2 shift C&E timing in the opposite direction. We further identified Sulf1, an extracellular sulfatase that modifies HSPGs, as the key effector by which sumf1 and sumf2 control C&E timing. Accordingly, reduced or increased levels of sulfated heparan sulfate similarly shift C&E onset and suppress sumf1 and sumf2 mutant phenotypes. Together, our work supports a model in which sumf2 expression at zebrafish gastrulation onset reduces sulfatase activity, rewriting HSPG sulfation patterns to promote and/or permit C&E morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

ABCC6, primarily expressed in the liver, regulates circulating levels of the mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate (PPi). In contrast, ANK is widely expressed and plays a dual role, maintaining extracellular PPi homeostasis and, notably, mediating cellular citrate efflux. We studied how both proteins affected extracellular metabolite levels, ectopic calcification, and bone homeostasis. We observed that plasma PPi was reduced by ~36% in Ankank/ank mice and ~60% in Abcc6-/- mice. However, plasma citrate levels depended primarily on ANK, dropping ~75% in Ankank/ank and double mutants, but remaining unchanged in Abcc6-/- mice. MicroCT revealed extreme ectopic calcification in double mutants, far exceeding either single knockout, affecting muzzle skin and ear cartilage. Oral citrate was bioavailable and, at high doses, prevented soft tissue calcification in Abcc6-/- mice, suggesting a systemic protective role. In bone, ANK was essential for incorporating both PPi and citrate, while ABCC6 mainly affected PPi. ANK deficiency led to reduced trabecular volume, cortical thickness, cortical area fraction, and mineral density, with more pronounced effects in males. Biomechanical testing showed decreased ultimate moment, bending rigidity, and energy in ANK-deficient femora, alongside increased post-yield displacement, indicating compensatory matrix changes. Collectively, our findings identify ANK as a dual regulator of PPi and citrate, with a previously unrecognized role in preventing soft tissue calcification.

We present OptSurvCutR (Optimal Survival Cut-Points in R programming), an R package designed to provide a complete, end-to-end workflow for robust and interpretable cut-point analysis. The package's methodology is structured into a logical three-step process. First, the find_cutpoint_number() function provides a data-driven approach to determine the optimal number of cut-points by comparing models using information criteria (e.g., AIC, AICc or BIC). Second, the find_cutpoint() function identifies the precise locations of these thresholds by optimising survival metrics, such as the log-rank statistic or hazard ratio, using either an exhaustive systematic search or an efficient genetic algorithm. Finally, the validate_cutpoint() function assesses the stability of the identified thresholds by generating 95% confidence intervals through bootstrap resampling. We demonstrate the package's full workflow using two case studies: a plant science example modelling the non-monotonic effect of temperature on rapeseed germination and a clinical bioinformatics analysis stratifying colorectal cancer patients by a microbial biomarker. These examples show how OptSurvCutR can uncover complex survival patterns that would be missed by traditional dichotomisation.

Although histriobdellids were always thought to be a part of the jaw-bearing clade Eunicida, their exact placement within the annelid tree is still debated due to their highly derived external morphology and long branch attraction artefacts in molecular analyses. In this study we employ morphological and molecular comparative approaches in order to gain new insights into the evolution of Histriobdellidae and its aberrant traits. Our phylogenetic analyses of Eunicida including 52 species and four molecular markers yield further support for Histriobdellidae being the sister group to the eunicid family Dorvilleidae. The detailed morphology of Histriobdella homari Van Beneden, 1858, a commensal of the European lobster, was examined using standard immunohistochemical stainings and subsequent confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Integrative analyses allow us to compare in detail with other eunicidans and unravel extensive anatomical transformations in Histriobdellidae. Neural innervation patterns help verify the presence of antennae and true annelid palps on the histriobdellid prostomium. The arrangement of ganglia and the neuronal scaffold innervating the anterior end supports the presence of a buccal segment (peristomium) in Histriobdella. Additionally, based on our comprehensive investigations we newly propose their adhesive anterior locomotory appendages to be homologous with parapodia, and their posterior-most adhesive locomotory appendages to be homologous with the pygidial lobes of other Annelida. Detailed studies of this highly deviating family of annelids not only exemplify how to reconstruct extreme transformation of canonical annelid characters such as parapodia, but again also highlight the exceptional evolutionary plasticity of the annelid body plan.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

A key example is biological motion perception, which relies on priors, or lifelong expectations about how bodies move. Yet it remains unclear how these priors shape the dynamics of neural prediction across hierarchical levels. Using a new dynamic extension to representational similarity analysis (dRSA), we measured how the brain of human participants predicted continuous dance movements recorded with magnetoencephalography. Under normal viewing conditions predictions followed a hierarchy: high-level viewpoint-invariant body motion was predicted earliest, while viewpoint-dependent body motion and low-level pixelwise motion were predicted closer to real-time. Disrupting high-level long-term priors by inverting videos selectively reduced high-level predictions. Instead, disrupting low-level short-term kinematics priors by piecewise scrambling eliminated all motion prediction, while increasing post-stimulus responses. These findings reveal how high- and low-level priors jointly shape predictive perception of naturalistic continuous input.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

J.; Akimzhanov, A. M.; Boehning, D.", "abstract": "Depletion of calcium from ER stores leads to the activation of calcium channels on the plasma membrane. This process is termed store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The proteins STIM1 and STIM2 function as ER calcium sensors, and upon store depletion, they undergo a conformational change that allows them to bind to and gate Orai calcium channels on the plasma membrane. We have shown that both Orai1 and STIM1 are dynamically S-acylated after store depletion, which is required for SOCE. These results suggest the requirement of a calcium-activated protein S-acyltransferase such as DHHC21. Here, we show that DHHC21 is required for SOCE in vitro and in vivo. Using the depilated mouse model that expresses DHHC21 but can no longer be activated by calcium, we show that DHHC21 is required for STIM1 S-acylation and subsequent calcium entry. Plasma membrane-localized DHHC21 is dynamically recruited into Orai1/STIM1 puncta upon store depletion, where it physically binds to STIM1. Finally, we show that depilated mice phenocopy many aspects of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), including defective Fas-mediated calcium release, T cell death, neutropenia, and increased serum vitamin B12 levels. These results suggest that dynamic S-acylation has underappreciated and expansive roles in second messenger signaling and immune system function. Therapeutic targeting of DHHC21 may be beneficial for ALPS and diseases associated with inappropriate activation of STIM1, such as tubular aggregate myopathy and Stormorken syndrome.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

This project used data from 2,320 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), which includes genome, epigenome, and transcriptome data from the same individuals, providing a rare opportunity to study interactions between omics layers. Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) was applied, an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method, to identify latent factors that capture shared variation across omics layers. These factors may reflect underlying biological mechanisms not directly observed in individual omics layers. The phenotypic focus of this study is wellbeing, a multifactorial trait involving emotional, psychological, and social dimensions. Following MOFA modeling, one latent factor showed to be statistically significantly associated with wellbeing. After studying the latent factor, it mainly seemed to capture epigenetic variation. The association between the latent factor and wellbeing did not remain significant after correcting for relevant covariates. The association was mainly driven by age, a well-known confounder of epigenetic signal. By adopting a multi-omics framework, this study managed to move beyond traditional single-omics, phenotype-driven approaches and provided a more integrated approach of how biological layers may jointly influence (or not) complex traits like wellbeing.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

The pyrenoid, an algal biomolecular condensate that mediates one-third of global CO2 fixation, typically exists as one large condensate per chloroplast, but during cell division it transiently dissolves and reconfigures into multiple smaller condensates. Here, we identify a kinase, KEY1, in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that regulates pyrenoid condensate size and number dynamics throughout the cell cycle and is necessary for normal pyrenoid function and growth. Unlike wild type, key1 mutant cells have multiple smaller condensates throughout the cell cycle that fail to dissolve during cell division. We show that KEY1 localizes to the condensates and promotes their dissolution by disrupting interactions between their core constituents, the CO2 -fixing enzyme Rubisco and its linker protein EPYC1, through EPYC1 phosphorylation. We develop a biophysical model that recapitulates KEY1-mediated condensate size and number regulation and suggests a mechanism for controlling condensate position. These data provide a foundation for the mechanistic understanding of the regulation of size, number, position, and dissolution in pyrenoids and other biomolecular condensates.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Dishevelled (Dvl), a central mediator of these pathways, contains conserved DIX, PDZ, and DEP domains, along with an extreme-C-terminus. Recent studies suggest that the extreme-C-terminus regulates non-canonical Wnt signalling via an autoinhibitory interaction with the PDZ domain. Non-canonical Wnt signalling branches into the planar cell polarity (PCP) and Wnt/Ca pathways. Profilin, a monomeric actin-binding protein, has been implicated in PCP signalling through Daam1-mediated actin polymerization, whereas its silencing disrupts the Wnt/Ca pathway in a Daam1-independent manner, pointing to a role for profilin upstream of Daam1. In this study, we identify a novel interaction between Dvl2 and profilin2. Co-localization and in vitro pull-down assays demonstrate that profilin2 directly interacts with Dvl2. Furthermore, our study reveals profilin2 binds specifically to the extreme-C-terminus of Dvl2, beyond the polyproline motif, without engaging the PDZ or DEP domains. This challenges the conventional view of profilin-polyproline interactions and highlights the existence of previously unrecognized molecular determinants. Moreover, we show that Dvl2 adopts an autoinhibited conformation through intramolecular binding of its extreme-C-terminus to the PDZ domain. Remarkably, profilin2 retains its binding ability even in this autoinhibited state. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized profilin2-Dvl2 interaction and provide new mechanistic insights into the molecular regulation of non-canonical Wnt signalling.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Here we present a dynamic, mechanistic, and individual-based model designed to simulate growth of urban trees and the associated provision of ecosystem services under varying climate conditions. The model is modular, runs at daily time steps and incorporates key biological processes such as photosynthesis, water limitation and biomass allocation. It simulates single-tree growth and quntifies ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, air filtration, and local climate regulation using species-specific parameters and local climate forcing. The model was calibrated and tested in a pilot application in Milan, simulating the long-term growth of three of three common broadleaved species (Platanus x acerifolia, Populus nigra and Robinia pseudoacacia) across different planting ages and climate scenarios. A multi-objective calibration was used to fit stem diameter and crown width, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess parameter robustness and uncertainty propagation. Results show realistic growth trajectories with clear species-age contrasts. Tree growth declines under stronger climate forcing, and ecosystem service provision scales non-linearly with age, with mature trees delivering far greater benefits. Carbon sequestration and air filtration decrease under more extreme scenarios, whereas local climate regulation exhibits a compensatory response: lower productivity is offset by higher evaporative demand, yielding stable or slightly increased evapotranspiration-based cooling. The model offers a promising tool for supporting urban forestry decisions related to planning, species selection, and long-term ecosystem service provision.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Surprisingly, one lineage within this family bears palp-like structures comparable to anterior head appendages in other Annelida. Nevertheless, a homology of the scalibregmatid appendages with those of other annelids is highly questionable. Using an integrative morphological approach including immunohistochemistry, azan-histology, and 3D reconstruction, we examined the neural innervation of the anterior head region in one travisiid and two scalibregmatid species: Travisia sp. (without appendages), Scalibregma celticum (lateral, prostomial horns), and Axiokebuita cavernicola (palp-like appendages). Scalibregma and Axiokebuita show an innervation pattern of their appendages different from that of palps in other annelids, while no prominent prostomial innervation is present in Travisia. The short, lateral horn-like appendages of S. celticum possess a quite diffuse neuronal scaffold extending from distinct neurite bundles originating from multiple regions of the brain. The elongated palp-like head appendages of A. cavernicola exhibit a neuronal innervation pattern comparable with that of thin sensory antennae known from other annelid groups. Thus, innervating neurites solely originate in the dorsal part of the brain, a pattern not observable for (true) feeding- or sensory palps of other taxa. We also shed new light on the mysterious neck organ in scalibregmatids, which are shown to be ventral dublications of the olfactory nuchal organs considering the level of external features and nervous innervation. These results, combined to previous phylogenetic studies, show that Scalibregmatidae are the only so far known annelids to have re-evolved palp-like sensory head structures after a secondary loss. Thus, this is the first example of convergent evolution of palps, a character complex hitherto showing similar overall innervation patterns and considered homologous across all annelids.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

CDG-causative genes were broadly but heterogeneously expressed, with both high and low expression aligning with clinical features. Interindividual variability in expression may contribute to phenotypic diversity in CDG. VPS13B was broadly expressed in fibroblasts, supporting their use in patient-derived models, while other genes showed more tissue-restricted expression, underscoring the importance of cellular context. Several genes exhibited tissue-specific deviations from balanced biallelic expression. Five allelic expression types across individuals - biallelic balanced or biased, tissue-specific or constitutive monoallelic, and autosomal random monoallelic - suggest a role for allelic regulation in phenotypic heterogeneity. Tissue-specific eQTLs highlighted regulatory complexity, with many variants located in intronic enhancers of unrelated genes.

The recently discovered histone lysine lactylation has already been explored in various pathological contexts, but less in normal tissues. This modification exists as two enantiomers, L- and D-lactylation; the first one may more likely modify histones due to abundant L-lactate produced by glycolysis. Here we report the identification by proteomics of L- and D-lactylation on lysines of histones H3 and H4 in mouse testis. We developed a targeted proteomic analysis of histone peptides using synthetic sequences modified by L- or D-lactyl, to acquire reliable identification and quantification data. Some histone peptides bearing either enantiomer are separated by reversed-phase chromatography. Interestingly, while several lysines of H3 and H4 exhibit a balanced amount of both enantiomers, residues 18 and 79 from histone H3 (H3K18 and H3K79) appear to be significantly more D-lactylated, while H3K23 is more L-lactylated. The stoichiometry of lactylation is low over the whole sequence of H3 and H4, representing 0.01 to 0.5%, which contrasts with acetylation whose abundance substantially varies between lysines. Interestingly, lactylation is more abundant than acetylation on the C-terminal half of H3 and H4. These results suggest a mechanism producing a mixture of the two enantiomers of lactate, or of a more direct substrate for lactylation, and supporting a site-selective addition of the enantiomers.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

To address this, we employed multi-omics to uncover molecular blueprints of liver versus skeletal muscle responses to chronic alcohol exposure, using a pre-clinical mouse model showing signs of alcohol-related liver dysregulation (diminished liver phosphatidylcholine-to-phosphatidylethanolamine lipid ratio) and alcohol-related myopathy (reduced muscle mass and strength). We found that the liver was more sensitive to chronic alcohol than muscle across the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome levels, but both tissues were equally sensitive at the lipidome level. The liver displayed an extensive and multi-layered metabolic molecular profile, while muscle was associated with upregulated inflammatory and matrisome responses and impaired mitochondrial energetics. Lipidome analyses also revealed a novel potential role for altered phospholipid remodelling in the aetiology of alcohol-related myopathy. Finally, computational drug repurposing identified several compounds for therapeutic targeting of alcohol-induced liver (e.g., saracatinib, GSK126) and muscle (e.g., metformin, trichostatin A) pathophysiology, perhaps working partly to counter metabolic dysregulation.

Spiking and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded in two macaque monkeys under going four sevoflurane concentrations (2%, 3%, 4%, and 6%). We aimed to (i) quantify the emergence of anesthesia-induced Up/Down state dynamics, (ii) track changes in oscillatory power and inter-regional synchrony, and (iii) determine whether frontal and parietal areas exhibit differential sensitivity to rising and falling anesthetic depth. Across different anesthetic levels, we observed characteristic slow oscillations in delta range in both PFC and PPC, with neurons transitioning between high-firing \"Up\" states and near-silent \"Down\" states. Deeper anesthesia extended Down states, suppressed mean firing rates, and reduced the frequency and duration of Up states. In M1, no single units were detected in PFC, and only a few were recorded in M2. We suspect misalignment of the probe with PFC pyramidal cells and extensive suppression in PFC as the main reasons. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) was used to extract Up/Down states from LFP activities, based one the pattern observed in the PPC. The PPC to PFC information flow observed in Transfer Entropy analysis suggests that even under anesthesia, some level of feedforward-like interactions may persist. Up states originate in deep cortical layers and propagate toward superficial layers, following a bottom-up progression, indicating that deep-layer pyramidal neurons, which receive strong thalamic input, may be the primary drivers of Up states. The short Up states under deep anesthesia might represent a failed ignition attempt, where the brain momentarily tries to reactivate but cannot sustain functional activity due to global inhibition. LFP analyses revealed that although the absolute delta power remains high at different anesthetic levels, the relative delta band power is anti correlated with anesthetic depth, due to sporadic short (20ms to 40ms) burst in gamma (30 - 100 Hz) that appeared transient in nature. Lower sensitivity to anesthesia dose changes were observed in PFC as compared to PPC. This could explain why anesthesia first impairs cognitive function before affecting basic sensory responses. These results indicates that the traditional Up/Down state models might oversimplify anesthetic brain dynamics. While anesthesia is often described as a state of simple global slow-wave oscillations, the observed Up/Down state durations are not uniform, they fluctuate, follow non-trivial transition patterns, and differ between PFC and PPC.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Statistical learning refers to the ability to extract patterns from sensory input through mere exposure and plays a central role in language acquisition. Surprisingly, statistical learning in FXS has not been explored. Given that children with FXS typically follow a delayed developmental trajectory for language, we hypothesized that they would show impaired statistical learning. To test this hypothesis, we used an EEG measure of neural entrainment to index statistical learning of hidden trisyllabic words within a continuous speech stream in children with FXS (n = 17) and in typically developing controls (n = 31). Children with FXS showed significantly reduced neural entrainment to words compared to controls, particularly in the superior temporal gyrus and transverse temporal gyrus (primary auditory cortex), providing evidence of statistical learning impairment. Notably, syllable-level entrainment was preserved or even enhanced in FXS, indicating that word-level deficits cannot be attributed to general auditory processing impairments. In addition, while typically developing controls showed an increase in word-level entrainment over the course of learning, children with FXS failed to show a similar increase over time. Taken together, this pattern of results demonstrates that children with FXS can process rapid, lower-order acoustic structure but struggle to integrate these syllables into longer, chunk-like word representations. Overall, these findings suggest that statistical learning is impaired in FXS, and also suggest neural entrainment to statistical structure as a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

The context dependent regulation of PSD protein phosphorylation in direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs) and indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) works to differentially and synergistically impact striatal physiology and the execution of motor programs. An important regulator of PSD protein phosphorylation is protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which obtains substrate specificity through the action of PP1 targeting proteins. While prior work has demonstrated the global and cell type-specific impact of the PP1 targeting protein, spinophilin, on striatal motor behaviors like the accelerating rotarod task and amphetamine sensitization, the role of its homologue, neurabin, is yet to be elucidated. Proteomics determined that striatal neurabin associates with pre and postsynaptic proteins associated with glutamatergic synapse function. Moreover, we found that global loss of neurabin enhanced rotarod motor learning but had no impact on amphetamine sensitization. Interestingly, using novel conditional neurabin knockout mouse lines, we found that loss of neurabin in dMSNs, but not iMSNs, enhanced performance on the accelerating rotarod task and that these effects were specific for male mice. These data highlight neurabin's particular importance to the striatal glutamatergic synapse and uncover a sex and cell type specific role for this synaptic protein in uniquely limiting skill motor learning but not psychomotor sensitization.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Past research has highlighted a functional relationship between the timing of saccades and oscillations in neural activity over posterior brain areas: saccades phase-lock to alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) and the degree of phase-locking, in natural scenes, has been associated with subsequent recognition memory. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the putative memory encoding benefit arises due to improved neuronal processing and, ultimately, better neural representation of foveated items, when saccades are locked to alpha phase. In a co-registered magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking paradigm, participants executed saccades from central fixation to images that appeared in the periphery, attempting to remember those images for later testing. Replicating past results, saccades to subsequently remembered images were preceded by greater inter-trial phase coherence in the alpha frequency band, at posterior MEG channels, consistent with the notion that the eye movements were phase-locked. Across participants, the degree of saccade phase-locking was positively correlated with how well visual and semantic properties of the images were represented in neural activity, within 200 ms of their foveation. This relationship was evident in responses localized to the left parieto-occipital and ventral temporal cortex, where greater saccade phase-locking was associated with improved visual and semantic representations, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that phase-locking saccades to alpha oscillations leads to improved neuronal representation of foveated stimuli, providing new mechanistic insight into how episodic memories are formed from discrete visual samples.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

We have crossed line 66 (L66) tau transgenic mice that overexpress the P301S aggregation-prone form of tau with C57Bl6/J mice expressing a single point mutation edited into the murine APP gene via CRISPR-Cas gene editing, termed APPA673T. We have performed ELISA, histopathological and behavioural analyses of heterozygous male/female L66 and L66xAPPA673T crosses at the age of 6 months to investigate the effect of the A673T mutation on tau brain pathology and behavioural deficits in these mice. Using immunohistochemistry, we found only a moderate, yet significant, reduction of mAb 7/51-reactive tau in prefrontal cortex for L66xAPPA673T compared to L66 mice. Quantification of tau in soluble/insoluble brain homogenate fractions by ELISA confirmed the lack of overt differences between genotypes, as did our extensive behavioural phenotyping using six different paradigms accessing motor function, olfaction, depression/apathy-like behaviour, as well as exploration and sociability. Therefore, the APPA673T mutation does not appear to modulate tau pathology or motor and neuropsychiatric behaviour in L66 tau transgenic mice.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Despite this, the molecular details underpinning CrrAB's contribution to ST258 pathogenicity are not well understood. We used RNA-sequencing to identify the regulon of CrrA and found that CrrAB induces the expression of a novel gene, encoding Crr-regulated fimbriae modifying protein (CfmP). CfmP post-translationally modifies fimbriae to significantly increase host cell adhesion and high bacterial loads within the host, consequently increasing ST258 virulence. CrrAB also drives high antibiotic resistance in CRKp.

Recent advancements in genetic diagnostic technologies have led to the identification of new genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders through CNVs. One such gene is CNTN6, whose variants and CNVs are associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Cntn6 encodes a neural cell adhesion molecule involved in rodents in axon and dendrite guidance, synapse formation, and oligodendrocyte differentiation, playing a critical role in brain development. However, in humans, the specific molecular and cellular pathogenetic mechanisms remain elusive. Using various techniques to model human brain development pathologies, such as somatic cell reprogramming, cerebral organoids, and genome editing, we established that the CNTN6 locus is involved in the lumenization and cell identity of radial glial cells, as well as in regulating their proliferation. Furthermore, we found that the CNTN6 locus is involved in the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of PAX6 protein, a key regulator of forebrain development. Molecular studies revealed that CNTN6 partially functions through the Notch signaling pathway during the early stages of human brain development.

Understanding how Darwinian evolution shapes these systems through eco-evolutionary feedbacks is a central challenge in ecology and evolution. Experimental studies using simplified microbial assemblages have yielded important insights into the ecological principles governing community states. However, an important knowledge gap is how selection within member species drives changes of community state in multispecies systems. Here, we present a fouryear evolution experiment involving a 23-species synthetic bacterial community propagated in two environments: a control medium and the same medium supplemented with the antibiotic streptomycin. Through combined analyses of community composition and genome evolution, we quantified the temporal changes in species abundances and the evolutionary trajectories of individual community members. The extended duration of the experiment enabled the detection of adaptive mutations and community state shifts that occur only over long evolutionary timescales. We show that community dynamics are environment dependent and reproducible across replicates, and that evolution of streptomycin resistance in a previously streptomycin-sensitive species on its own can induce abrupt community state shifts. Our results provide a direct demonstration of eco-evolutionary feedbacks within a multi-species community, revealing how a single adaptive mutation can reorganize complex ecological networks.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Looking backward in time, the IICR of a couple of lineages collected in a deme is characterized by a short period of constant value (the scattering phase) followed by an increase over time (the transition phase) up to a plateau (the collecting phase). Both algorithms recovered the IICR at the collecting phase but significantly deviated from the values expected during the transition phase under specific parameters combination. Specifically, the total error increased with the number of demes and the abruptness of the transition phase, which in turn is related to the extent of between demes connectivity. Moreover, each algorithm displayed a specific bias, corresponding backward in time to an artificial expansion either at the beginning of the collecting phase (PSMC) or of the transition phase (SMC++). Our results demonstrate that the observed systematic biases carry information about metapopulation dynamics, rather than being simple artefacts. Moreover, combining the results obtained from the two algorithms will increase our understanding of the historical demography of the metapopulations and help to put forward specific evolutionary scenarios to be tested with model-based algorithms using SFS or LD statistics.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Although the contributing loci are unknown, heterosis strength varies polygenically, with crosses between stiff stalk and non-stiff stalk lineages often producing the highly heterotic F1 seed used for agriculture. As F1 genomes conserve the parental cis-regulatory state, F1 trans-interactions between haplotypes underpin F1 trait over-dominance and heterotic gene expression. Gene expression relies upon transcription factors binding cis-regulatory elements in accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) and recruiting RNA POLYMERASE II. Here, assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) examined cis-regulatory element chromatin accessibility inheritance in three different F1 parent-offspring pairs, including a representative stiff stalk-by-non-stiff stalk (B73xOh43) cross. Using concatenated reference alignment, we categorized ACR modes of inheritance (additive, dominant, under/over-dominant), revealing that ACRs are largely inherited additively, and, concordantly, that chromatin accessibility has strong narrow-sense heritability. However, mirroring other heterotic phenotypes, the B73xOh43 cross exhibited the most dominant and over-dominant inheritance. Comparing allele-specific parent-to-offspring chromatin accessibility, we identified F1 differentially trans-regulated ACRs. Using a matched chromatin accessible diversity panel, we found B73xOh43 SNPs with more ACR trans-associations than expected due to chance. These trans-regulatory variants revealed how cell-division and anabolism are elevated in heterotic F1 seedlings. This multiple discovery filtering (MDF) approach to trans-regulatory variant detection is genomic modality agnostic and stands to empower trans-relationship dissection in diverse genetic models.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Our analysis uncovers numerous previously uncharacterized domains with key functional implications and demonstrates that BrxA- and BrxB-like homologs are universally present across all subtypes, thereby redefining the core machinery of BREX. Our survey strikingly expands the BREX landscape by characterizing three newly defined RM-like systems, which we term BREX-related (BR) systems, and establishes them as new subtypes that share multiple core components with BREX. Furthermore, we identified a novel composite anti-invader system that intriguingly integrates the BREX machinery with components derived from HerA/FtsK-based capture and Dpd defense systems, forming a unique multifaceted defense machinery. Notably, we identify an extensive repertoire of auxiliary effectors recruited alongside the primary effectors across all BREX and BR systems, functioning to reinforce initial restriction responses and counter phage anti-defense mechanisms.

To overcome these challenges, we developed Telomere Conformation Capture by sequencing (Telomere-C), a novel high-throughput approach for the genome-wide identification of telomeric chromatin interactions. We applied Telomere-C to three normal fibroblast cell lines (BJ, IMR90, WI38), one telomerase-positive cancer cell line (HeLa S3) and two cancer cell lines (U2-OS and WI38-VA13) that maintain telomeres by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). We generated millions of telomere-associated reads per sample and identified up to 41,026 interaction peaks. We successfully validated previously-described telomeric interaction sites (e.g., TERT and DUX4), and critically, revealed a novel class of ultra-long-range interactions extending over 5 Mb away from the telomere, which surprisingly constitute over 80% of all identified contacts. Contrary to prior studies focusing on protein coding gene interactions, we discovered that the telomeric 3D interactome is overwhelmingly anchored at repetitive element hubs, particularly interstitial telomeric sequence (ITS), telomere-associated repeat 1 (TAR1) and D20S16 elements. We found that the clustering of these interactions correlates strongly with cell-type-specific telomere maintenance. Most notably, D20S16 telomeric interactions were uniquely and highly enriched in ALT cancer cells, suggesting a mechanistic link. Taken together, our study effectively constructs the first high resolution maps of the telomeric 3D interactome, redefining its scope to be dominated by ultra-long-range contacts with repetitive elements. This work provides fundamental insights into telomeric nuclear organization and establishes the telomeric D20S16 interaction as a molecular signature for the ALT pathway.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aim to computationally investigate a possible relation between aortic hemodynamics and SVD development. To this aim, we collect data from twelve patients with and without SVD at long-term follow-up exams. Starting from pre-operative clinical images, we build early post-operative virtual scenarios and we perform Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations by prescribing a personalized flow rate based on Echo Doppler data. In order to identify a premature onset of SVD, we propose three computational hemodynamic indices: Wall Damage Index (WDI), Leaflet Delamination Index (LDI), and Leaflet Permeability Index (LPI). Additionally, to each index we associate a score and, using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we find that each score individually shows a statistically greater median value in the SVD sub-population (WDI: p=0.008, LDI: p=0.001, LPI: p=0.020). Finally, we define a synthetic scoring system that clearly separates between SVD and non-SVD patients.

This work evaluates deep learning-based object detection as an efficient end-to-end alternative for automating tau lesion identification and classification. We fine-tuned YOLO and Faster R-CNN models on a dataset of 29,852 tau lesions from 16 PSP brain slides, achieving mAP@50 of 0.702. To address limitations of conventional object detection models with overconfident spatial predictions, we integrated Monte Carlo Dropout into both architectures to estimate spatial and label uncertainty. We evaluated detection uncertainty using Probability-based Detection Quality. Our results demonstrate that incorporating uncertainty offers a more comprehensive evaluation of detection reliability, complementing traditional metrics like mAP. For clinical application, we integrated a non-stochastic YOLO model into QuPath for whole-slide inference. Downstream clinical validation was conducted, including SHAP-based saliency analysis and correlation between model-predicted tau densities and clinical disease severity scores.

Still, how nisin-producing strains can protect themselves against nisin's bactericidal effects is only partially understood. Located within the nisin biosynthesis operon, the heterotetrameric ABC transporter NisFEG transports nisin to the extracellular environment, granting autoimmunity to the producer strain. NisFEG belongs to the LanFEG family of ABC transporters, members of which are found in some lantibiotic-producing bacterial strains. However, their structure has not been elucidated. In this work, we constructed a full atom model of NisFEG in the ATP-bound conformation. The architecture of the complex reveals a narrow transmembrane interface with prominent lateral clefts, similar to those observed in other exporters of hydrophobic compounds. Through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observed that one of the most conserved elements of the LanFEG family, the E-loop of the nucleotide binding domain, interacts preferentially with a small intracellular helix of the NisG transmembrane chain. Cosolvent MD simulations reveal the presence of a putative binding site within the lateral cleft of the transporter, next to the transmembrane chain NisE. Mutational analysis showed that large hydrophobic residues near this putative site are relevant to the transporter function, and more so than analogous residues in the opposite cleft. Our results suggest that nisin extrusion operates in an asymmetric manner, where contacts between the E-loop and NisG are the driving force for the conformational changes triggered by ATP hydrolysis, whereas the NisE subunit is the main mediator of interactions with the lantibiotic. This functional asymmetry could provide an explanation for why the LanFEG family has evolved two distinct transmembrane chains, where each one was selected to perform a single step in an optimal way, maximizing the immunity of lantibiotic-producing bacteria.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

The observed growth rate reduction aligns remarkably with a 1D Lockhart viscoplastic model, experimentally validating this framework in tip-growing cells.

Hydroxylation of the precursor jasmonic acid (JA) by Jasmonic Acid Oxidases (JAO) holds a peculiar regulatory function, by attenuating basal JA-Ile formation and action, and promoting growth.

Applying this framework to extensive measurements of cortical responses during different attentional tasks, we find that tuning changes are the primary driver of improved population representations. In contrast, correlation changes, though present, have minimal--or even detrimental--effects to information content due to its strong interactions with other changes (e.g., tuning, variability).

Here, we tested the hypothesis that internal models support this process by compressing high-dimensional input into lower-dimensional, goal-relevant subspaces. Human participants performed a serial reversal learning task requiring dynamic inference of the currently relevant stimulus dimension(s). Behavioural data showed rapid adaptation to context switches, with improving accuracy and faster responses over trials. A hidden state inference (HSI) model, which maintains probabilistic beliefs over latent contexts, best explained behaviour, outperforming multiple reinforcement learning variants in predicting both choices and inferred context. Eye-tracking revealed that gaze selectively converged on task-relevant features over time, with reduced attentional entropy and increased fixation within relevant regions, hallmarks of belief-guided attention. Crucially, gaze patterns were tightly linked to model dynamics: attentional focus increased when belief updating succeeded and decreased after trials where the model signalled high prediction errors. Guided by these results, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to understand the goal-relevant transformations within subspaces and found that neural representations expanded along relevant dimensions and compressed along irrelevant ones, with effects emerging just before decisions. These modulations of space correlated with reaction time, such that participants responded faster when the distance along relevant axes increased. Strikingly, these transformations preceded feedback-locked frontal theta responses modulated by prediction error, suggesting that internal models proactively reconfigure cortical state space in anticipation of learning.

The translation machinery itself is largely encoded by mRNAs with terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, which can be post-transcriptionally controlled by the mTOR signaling pathway. In neurons, these mRNAs are selectively enriched in axons, dendrites and synapses, suggesting local functions for their regulation. Here, we use a brain-specific knockout of the mTOR effector and TOP mRNA binding protein, Larp1, to uncover its role in brain development and behavior. Loss of Larp1 significantly decreases brain mass and reduces the density of neurons. We find that TOP mRNAs levels are depleted by more than 50% and selectively lost from synapses, reversing the enrichment that occurs when Larp1 is present. In behavior tests, Larp1-deficient mice are severely impaired in spatial learning and memory. These results demonstrate a critical role for Larp1 in maintaining the levels of essential mRNAs necessary for brain growth and highlight the importance of post-transcriptional regulation by mTOR for normal learning and memory.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

L.; Crowe, G.; Nelson, E.; Al Mokbil, M.; Stein, W.", "abstract": "Spreading depression (SD) is a wave of neuronal hyperactivity followed by depolarization block that propagates through large brain regions and is associated with disorders such as migraine, stroke, and brain injury. The mechanisms that initiate SD and alter susceptibility to it remain incompletely understood. Here, we use whole-brain fluorescence imaging with genetically encoded pan-neuronal calcium and voltage sensors to observe SD in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that rapid cooling, a naturally occurring environmental condition, as well as elevated extracellular potassium reliably elicit SD in both adult and larval flies. SD was characterized by a rapid and large rise in intracellular calcium that was accompanied by neuronal depolarization and stark changes in the transperineuronal potential. In adults, SD occurred at 6.7 {+/-} 0.6{degrees}C (N=15) and in larvae at 6.0 {+/-} 0.3{degrees}C (N=30). SD initiation was not restricted to specific sites, but initiated at multiple, variable sites across and within individuals, with an average of 3.0 {+/-} 0.7 (N=8) initiation points per brain. In all cases, SD spread throughout large areas of the nervous system. In a high-throughput larval assays that allows the simultaneous monitoring of up to 16 animals with repeated cooling cycles, we demonstrate that single SD events are followed by a transient refractory period lasting up to 45 minutes, during which the threshold for subsequent SD was significantly elevated. This was the case in adult and larval brains of all developmental stages. The refractory effect was independent of neuronal depolarization, suggesting that homeostatic processes alter SD susceptibility following an initial SD event. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that SD initiation and propagation are not restricted to specific regions, neuronal populations, or developmental stages, and they reveal fundamental properties of adaptive changes to SD susceptibility in a genetically tractable model. Building upon the extensive genetic toolkit available in Drosophila, this work establishes the fly as a complementary model for understanding conserved cellular and circuit-level mechanisms of SD relevant to human neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that LCC-associated mutations cluster in function and molecular behaviour according to distinct structural domains within U8, differentially impairing U8 processing, activity and stability. Further, we show that when U8 function is hypomorphic, exogenous human U8 and the endogenous zebrafish U8.3 paralogue increase in stability through a newly discovered post-transcriptional mechanism. This latter response is compromised in patients with LCC due to the presence of a common polymorphism of an N6-methyladenosine modified nucleotide, which we predict to impact disease penetrance.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Here we demonstrate that low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning prevents systemic inflammation-induced behavioral abnormalities through microglia-dependent mechanisms in male mice. Mice received preconditioning with 0.2 mg/kg LPS or saline for two consecutive days, followed by high-dose LPS challenge (5 mg/kg) or saline seven days later. Behavioral assessment revealed that preconditioning specifically prevented social preference deficits induced by systemic inflammation (preference score: -0.49+/-0.19 vs 0.14+/-0.10, p<0.01), while showing limited effects on locomotor activity and depression-like behaviors. Additionally, LPS preconditioning prevented anxiety-like behavior in a chronic corticosterone model and attenuated hippocampal inflammatory gene expression. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that preconditioning suppressed microglial activation in hippocampal CA1 region, particularly reducing PBR/IBA1 ratio (37.5+/-2.4% vs 27.6+/-2.8%, p<0.01), with less pronounced effects in CA3. Critically, pharmacological microglial depletion using PLX3397 during the preconditioning period completely abolished these protective effects, establishing the causal role of microglia. Flow cytometric analysis revealed preconditioning-induced shifts in brain macrophage subpopulations defined by TMEM119 and CD45 expression patterns. Transcriptomic profiling identified subpopulation-specific responses, with one subset showing LPS-response pathway enrichment despite minimal gene expression changes, while another displayed extensive but functionally non-specific transcriptional alterations.

To elucidate the mechanism of recalibration, we simultaneously recorded from place cells, which instantiate the cognitive map, and head direction (HD) cells, thought to orient the map. Persistent conflict between self-motion and visual feedback induced functionally identical recalibration of path-integration gain in the two neural populations during forward locomotion; however, during locomotor immobility accompanied by head-scanning, HD cells did not exhibit recalibration. Moreover, the two populations manifested differential field-shifting dynamics relative to landmarks during recalibration.

Targeted metabolite profiling revealed that deletion of ATG5 induced widespread metabolic reprogramming characterized by increased glucose and amino acid uptake. Functionally, ATG5-knockout CAR-T cells maintained high cytolytic activity when assayed in patient-derived ascites in vitro, and exhibited superior and long-lasting tumor control against ovarian tumors in vivo.

In this study, we developed computer vision models to detect, classify, and map 100 tree genera across 23 cities in North America using Google Street View (GSV) and iNaturalist images. We validated our predictions in independent portions of each city. We then compared our predictions to existing street tree records to evaluate the spatial context of errors using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Overall, the computer vision models identified the majority of independent, ground-truthed street trees (67.1%), and performance varied across the 23 cities (67.4% +- 9.3%) and 100 genera (50.9% +- 23.0%). Matching success increased with local street-view image density, simpler local stand structure, and greater training representation, particularly from the focal city.

In this article, we use individual-based simulations to estimate fixation probabilities of inversions arising on autosomes and sex chromosomes under a wide range of parameter values. As shown previously, `lucky' inversions carrying a lower-than-average mutation load are initially favored and tend to spread. Our results show that linkage to a permanently heterozygous SDR (on a Y or W chromosome) or to a mating-type locus hinders the spread of inversions when Ns is high (where N is population size and s the strength of selection against deleterious alleles), as the absence of recombination leads to mutation accumulation. However, it may help the spread of inversions when Ns is lower and/or when the dominance coefficient of deleterious alleles is low, by allowing the fixation of inversions that initially carry deleterious alleles, despite the fact that they eventually become deleterious (`sheltering' effect). Finally, we show that partial selfing may either help or hinder the spread of inversions capturing a mating-type locus, as they benefit from the masking of deleterious alleles, but also suffer from a higher equilibrium mutation load.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated centromere and karyotype evolution in the endangered Tapirus indicus, a non-equid Perissodactyl with exceptional karyotypic plasticity. Through CENP-A ChIP-seq analysis on the same individual for which a near-gapless diploid genome assembly was available, we identified both canonical satellite-based centromeres and three satellite-free centromeres, emerging from centromere repositioning and representing the first such centromeres described in a non-equid Perissodactyl species. Comparative genomic analysis uncovered evolutionary hotspots for satellite-free centromere formation across Perissodactyla. Finally, analysis of CENP-B binding showed that T. indicus displays uncoupling between CENP-A and CENP-B, a feature previously observed only in equids.

Despite strong evidence that the physiology of the animals is not compromised by such protocols, fluid control remains controversial due to its potential impact on the psychological well-being of the animals. To address this concern, we investigated the effect of fluid control on the affective state of 23 socially-housed adult macaques (10 females) engaged in neuroscience experiments. The protocol involved up to five consecutive days of fluid control per week, followed by a minimum of two days with unrestricted fluid access. The affective state of the animals was primarily assessed by quantifying the frequency of pharmacologically-validated behavioural indicators of high-arousal negative affect (self-scratching, body shaking, self-grooming). The analysis was subsequently extended to validated behavioural indicators of low-arousal negative affect (Inactive not alert) and other behaviours suspected of indicate high-arousal negative affect but lacking proper validation (pacing, yawning). In total, 700 hours of video footage spanning up to seven years of intermittent fluid control per animal were analysed. Despite this extensive dataset, the study found no significant impact of fluid control on average, or any evidence of habituation or sensitization over the years on any of the affective state indicators. Additional results indicate that these null results are not due to a lack of sensitivity, supporting the view that fluid control, as implemented in this study, does not have an adverse impact on the psychological well-being of laboratory macaques.

Hence, there is no reproducible approach for iHLC maturation. We report the assembly of a multicellular 3D human liver organoid that recapitulates the in vivo hepatic microenvironment. Intra- and intercellular signaling between human hepatic cells and iHLCs results in their maturation. Within seven-days, iHLCs in organoids expressed markers of hepatocyte maturation that were statistically similar to PHHs including alphafetoprotein (AFP), hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-4, and albumin. Ki67+ iHLCs decreased by 2-fold from Days 1 to 14. Expression of two cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1, in iHLCs were statistically similar to PHHs by Days 7 and 14, respectively. Biotransformation of acetaminophen and ethanol were statistically similar to PHHs by Day 14. On Day 1, the concentration of endogenously secreted prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was identical to values reported in adult humans.

Protein profiling revealed a stepwise increase in molecular complexity, with enhanced detection of neural-related proteins linked to axon guidance, synapse formation, and GTPase signaling. This trend was most pronounced in tissue-like models, underscoring their suitability for studying neuronal maturation and circuit assembly. Functional enrichment analyses showed progressive acquisition of neurodevelopmental programs, including synaptic vesicle cycling, presynaptic organization, neurotransmitter regulation, and late-stage gliogenesis, accompanied by increased expression of astrocytic and oligodendrocytic markers. Kinase diversity also increased across models, reaching up to 210 regulatory kinases in organoids, many implicated in neural development and degeneration. Gene set enrichment for neurological pathways mirrored this trend, aligning proteomic complexity with disease relevance.

Here, we show that AAV-mediated Nato3 gene transfer into the mouse substantia nigra prevents DA neuron degeneration in both MPTP-induced and -synuclein (-Syn) overexpression PD models. This neuroprotective effect is achieved by improving autophagic flux and -Syn clearance. Furthermore, lentiviral-mediated NATO3 overexpression in human midbrain DA neurons, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells carrying the pathological -Syn A53T mutation, effectively reversed key disease hallmarks. These include -Syn accumulation, aberrant mitochondrial morphology, autophagic impairments, and compromised neurite structure.

Evolutionarily conserved, Notch plays a key role in numerous cell fate decisions during development and is also required in post-mitotic brain neurons for the consolidation of long-term memory and long-term habituation. Notch signaling is highly expressed in glial cells, where it plays a key role in regulating their development and proliferation. More recently, a Notch-dependent neuroglial pathway has been implicated in modulating the susceptibility of short-term memory to sleep deprivation in Drosophila. In this study, we demonstrate that canonical Notch signaling in glia -mediated by the Delta ligand and the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless- is activated in a subset of cortex and ensheathing glial cells. This signaling is essential for the formation of short-term memory in the aversive phototaxic suppression assay, which is sensitive to sleep deprivation. Dopaminergic transmission is known to be required for this type of learning and is negatively impacted by sleep deprivation, suggesting a possible interaction between Notch and dopamine pathways. Supporting this idea, we find that modulating dopaminergic transmission downregulates canonical Notch activity in glial cells. Conversely, activating Notch signaling in glia near dopaminergic neurons prevents the learning impairments typically caused by sleep deprivation. Notably, Notch signaling itself does not appear to alter dopamine levels in the brain. Together, these findings indicate that canonical Notch signaling in a specific subset of glial cells is essential for short-term memory formation and is modulated by dopaminergic signaling. This suggests that sleep loss-induced disruption of dopaminergic transmission impairs learning by downregulating canonical Notch signaling. Since Notch homologs are highly expressed in mammalian glia, this pathway may be conserved and functionally relevant in other species, including humans.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Neuroimaging studies have implicated cortical midline structures and the default mode network (DMN) associated with self-related processing, but replication across sites and larger samples is needed. Methods: We examined neural correlates of self- versus other-agency judgments in two independent cohorts of first-episode schizophrenia patients (n = 177) and controls (n = 123) recruited at separate MRI centers. During fMRI, participants performed an agency-related task. Data were analyzed using independent component analysis and statistical parametric mapping, focusing on networks associated with self-referential processing. Results: Across both sites, self-agency consistently engaged the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus, key regions of the DMN. Schizophrenia patients exhibited significantly reduced DMN activation during self-referential processing compared to controls. While site-related differences were noted in the magnitude of activation, the core pattern of DMN disruption was robust across analytic approaches and datasets. Conclusions: This study replicates and extends prior findings of altered self-agency processing in schizophrenia, demonstrating consistent DMN hypo-activation in first-episode patients across two independent cohorts. These results validate the agency paradigm as a reliable probe of self-related neural mechanisms and support models of schizophrenia as a disorder of altered self-perception.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

However, a scalable strategy to map TFs in primary human T cells is lacking, which limits our understanding of the functions of critical TFs. We therefore adapted a transposon-based TF mapping strategy termed Calling Cards for primary human CD8 T cells, applying it to five key TFs with undefined binding sites in this cell type: TOX, TOX2, TCF7, SOX4, and RBPJ. To derive biological insights from these data, we developed an analytical framework to integrate TF binding with multi-omic sequencing data, revealing convergence of TOX and TCF7 binding at dynamic enhancers of memory CD8 T cells. We then identified TF co-bound gene programs related to memory and exhaustion states in addition to putative gene targets of known and unappreciated TF roles, including TOX binding at critical genes of both exhaustion and terminal effector memory differentiation. To further scale our TF analysis platform, we modified Calling Cards to create TFlex: a method uniquely suited for multiplexed mapping of paralogous TFs. We applied TFlex to simultaneously map eight natural and domain-swapped TFs in primary human CD8 T cells, which demonstrated that domain-swapped TFs display emergent behavior in binding site selection and transcriptional effects on target genes that cannot be estimated as the sum of their constituent domains.

Biotin metabolism, essential in most bacteria, remains underexploited therapeutically. Here, we uncover a highly conserved, co-located biosynthetic megacluster in Streptomyces, a striking \"cluster of clusters\", that encodes four distinct natural product families: acidomycin, stravidins, dapamycins, and -methyl-KAPA, and is flanked by genes that encode streptavidin, a high-affinity biotin-binding protein. Remarkably, all molecules target different steps in bacterial biotin metabolism, revealing a multi-pronged natural strategy for biotin starvation. This arrangement of four functionally convergent biosynthetic gene clusters at a single genomic locus is without precedent. Even more surprisingly, we find that this anti-biotin megacluster is widespread across Streptomyces bacteria, suggesting a deeply conserved evolutionary solution to microbial competition. Mechanistically, the compounds inhibit biotin biosynthesis through enzyme blockade, prodrug activation, covalent cofactor mimicry, and biotin sequestration via co-expressed streptavidin. Stravidin S2 and -methyl-KAPA are effective in a murine model of multidrug-resistant E. coli infection.

Though these fungal phytopathogens have been found to frequently cohabitate the same leaf, their interaction dynamics in the manifestation of disease remain poorly understood due to limitations in species-specific detection methods. We developed a digital PCR based model targeting conserved regions of the -tubulin gene, enabling biomass quantification of both pathogens during infection. Field surveys revealed up to two in three symptomatic infections involved both pathogens, with co-infected plants showing significantly higher individual pathogen biomass than single-species infections. Host plants in the field with moderate resistance to both pathogens were found to be significantly more necrotic under co-infection, with individual pathogen biomass up to twice that observed value for single infections. However, like fair-weather friends the partnership between these two pathogens seems to be conditional. When P. tritici-repentis established first, secondary P. nodorum colonisation led to a breakdown of host resistance. Conversely, when P. nodorum established on the host first, it suppressed P. tritici-repentis colonisation regardless of host resistance. To our knowledge this is the first description of asymmetric priority effects overcoming host resistance in a plant pathosystem.

Recognising liver disease stages and elucidating the molecular underpinning of their progression are thus medically important. Methods Using data gathered from 300 patients with obesity of the ABOS cohort, we selected non-redundant clinical variables, gene expressions and CpGs methylation levels most associated with severity using unsupervised approaches to train a multi-module, multi-layer perceptron predicting patients liver status. Results The combination of five models trained on the three modalities reached an AUC of 0.945 on a validation set, with accuracies above 81% for simple steatosis and 88% for NASH, outperforming other machine learning models so far. The latent space of our clinical data module retrieved patient clusters identified previously, but not the gene expression and DNA methylation ones. While all three modules are needed to reach the best prediction accuracy in all classes, the gene expression module impacted the decision the most. Independently trained models put more weights on the same genes, underlying their importance. Impactful genes were linked to immune responses and extracellular matrix. Many of those genes were previously unassociated with MASLD onset or progression. Conclusions A multi-omics deep-learning model can recognise steatohepatitis from simple liver steatosis with an AUC of 0.945 and identify new genes potentially involved in NAFLD progression.

The discovery of preferential transcription in the meiotic MIC at regions enriched with transposons, and the identification of MIC transcription regulatory proteins, emphasizes the necessity to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving this process. In this study, we demonstrate that G/C-rich tracts are overrepresented in meiotic non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcription regions and that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is highly enriched at and around these tracts. Further analysis revealed that Pol II's association with G/C-rich tracts is not abolished in cells lacking Rib1, a Mediator complex-associated protein essential for MIC ncRNA biogenesis. Nevertheless, in the absence of Rib1, Pol II showed abnormal association with the meiotic MIC chromatin, suggesting that Rib1 is critical for maintaining Pol II's binding specificity. Through Rib1 truncation analysis, we found that the intrinsically disordered region, which contains putative phase-separating peptides, is crucial for its function. Disruption of phase-separation, either by deleting these peptides or by treating cells with a phase-separation disruption reagent, leads to aberrant localization of both Rib1 and Pol II on the MIC chromatin, implicating that Rib1 likely facilitates the MIC ncRNA transcription via phase-separation.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

These effects are widely believed to result in the acetylation of distinct histones that regulate specific genes, including at transcription starting sites (TSS) and enhancers. However, we show that this is not the case, as butyrate dose-dependently increases the acetylation of histones throughout the entire genome. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the RING-loop prevents the recruitment of p300 to acetylated histones through its bromodomain, and thereby cannot maintain the acetylation of specific histones through positive feedback. This was confirmed by showing that only catalytically inactive p300 stably binds to acetylated histones. Thus, the epigenetic regulation of specific genes by butyrate is limited, but butyrate instead increases histone acetylation globally resulting in opening of the entire chromatin structure.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Genetically encoded biosensors based on Forster's Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) are powerful tools to track kinase dynamics. Yet, they are typically limited by spatial resolution and remain challenging to implement with super-resolution microscopy approaches that require specific fluorophores or optical setups. Aurora kinase A (AURKA), a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, has recently emerged as a critical regulator of mitochondrial physiology. However, visualising AURKA activation and activity in living cells with sub-diffraction precision remains a challenge. Here, we introduce BioSenSRRF, a versatile approach that combines conventional FRET biosensors with Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations (SRRF) microscopy. BioSenSRRF requires no modification of existing probes, can be implemented using standard microscopy setups, and is supported by a publicly available ImageJ framework to streamline image processing and data analysis. Using this pipeline, we imaged AURKA activation at mitochondria and its activity in regulating mitochondrial ATP levels. We uncover that AURKA activation and activity are compartmentalised into distinct mitochondrial domains containing the mitochondrial ATP synthase. These subdomains depend on the catalytic activity of AURKA, and they can be altered using previously validated AURKA inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrate that the cancer-associated polymorphism F31I enhances AURKA activation and ATP production on ATP synthase-enriched subdomains, underscoring its pathological relevance. Altogether, BioSenSRRF provides a broadly accessible framework to enhance the spatial resolution of genetically encoded biosensors.

Building on a stochastic epidemiological model that predicts CBSD spread at the scale of Uganda, we incorporate extensive field surveillance records to extend the model to all thirty-two major cassava-producing countries in SSA. We then deploy the model to address key strategic questions such as estimating the present day CBSD distribution and predicting rates of ongoing spread towards West Africa. We also evaluate the risk of direct introductions resulting from long range movement of infected planting material, which could trigger outbreaks beyond predicted localised dispersal limits. Our model predicts the likely arrival of CBSD in Nigeria via cross-continental spread within 25 years, and if directly introduced anywhere in West Africa, spreading to most West African nations within 10 years. The risks of ongoing and future CBSD spread highlighted in this study underscore the need for proactive phytosanitation measures, including clean seed programs, vector control, and quarantine policies to curb CBSD spread.

Here, we aim to clarify the role of weather conditions on Ae. albopictus presence and abundance in four sites in southwestern France. We rely on ovitrap longitudinal records collected on a 1-2 weeks basis and weather time series over 2023 and 2024 to model oviposition activity. Our analysis combines a mechanistic model from literature and a new machine learning model fitted on cross-correlated lagged weather predictors. Both models satisfactorily reproduce the observed oviposition dynamics, correctly predicting the onset and the end of the activity - periods that existing models have often inadequately captured. Temperature plays a major role in triggering the presence of Ae. albopictus, explaining the interannual variation of oviposition in all sites, especially in spring and autumn. In fact, warm springs and autumns extend the periods in which Ae. albopictus life-history traits (fertility, development, survival) approach their thermal optima.

We quantified additive genetic variance for mortality risk using a controlled breeding design and found levels of variation consistent with existing data on major fitness components. We found no evidence for inbreeding effects on mortality risk, suggesting that dominance genetic variance makes little contribution to this trait. To explain the high level of standing genetic variation, we considered whether mortality risk depends on the metabolic resources available to an individual, also known as \"condition\". We manipulated condition by inducing random mutations and by restricting calories during larval development. We found that reduced condition due to both random mutations and resource limitation significantly increased the risk of mortality following trauma. Among inbred lines, greater mortality risk was associated with lower viability, fecundity and longevity, consistent with an effect of genome-wide genetic quality. Our results suggest that further consideration of individual condition would be valuable for understanding and predicting variation in the outcomes of traumatic brain injury.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate the robust performance of this 1D 1H NMR experiment using biphasic samples containing condensates of FUS N-terminal domain, FUS full-length, and the multicomponent condensate formed by two intrinsically disordered regions of hnRNPC1 protein with highly overlapping resonances. Integrating the multiplexing filter into multidimensional experiments enables site-specific structural and dynamic insights from diverse protein populations, extending NMR applications in LLPS.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Molten globule (MG) states of proteins have been described as special types of intermediate states within the energy landscape diagram of proteins. In a cell, the MG state has functional significance compared to the native or unfolded states owing to its enhanced side-chain dynamics. In this study, we re-examined the acid-denatured state of the metalloprotein azurin and also investigated whether circular permutation (CP) of azurin can lead to modulation of the energy landscape to yield intermediate or MG states. CP is a protein engineering tool that allows the rearrangement of the secondary structural elements without perturbing the overall three-dimensional protein structure. We carried out comprehensive thermal, chemical, and pH denaturation studies to examine possible MG states in azurin WT. We additionally examined two CPs of azurin, whose energy landscapes in the metal-free and metal-bound forms have been previously characterized. One of the positions of CP is near the metal-binding loop (cpN42) and the other is within the active site of the protein (cpF114). We used thermal denaturation monitored by far-UV and near-UV CD, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of a buried Trp, and solvent accessibility of the same Trp residue to evaluate the presence of MG states in these proteins. WT azurin shows binding with ANS at a low pH due to ionic interaction with the fluorophore at this pH. We find that though WT azurin does not adopt an MG state, CP of azurin(s) exhibited an MG state. Our findings highlight the potential of CP to modulate protein energy landscapes and consequently the physiological functions of proteins.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluated its ocular concentration and safety profile following topical administration in three animal species -mouse, rabbit, and pig-. MP-004 formulation with 0.3% hyaluronic acid significantly enhanced retinal concentration in mice compared to non-formulated compound (6.67 vs 1.27 vs. 61549;g/g at 4 h). MP-004 reached therapeutically relevant retinal concentrations in all species tested, with minimal systemic exposure: in mice, levels detected in serum were lower than 5 ng/mL while in rabbits, the compound was undetectable in blood and peripheral tissues 12 h post-dose. Seven-day repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice and rabbits showed no systemic or ocular toxicity. In rabbits, only transient ocular redness was observed post-administration, with no evidence of corneal damage or systemic adverse effects. Hematological and biochemical parameters in both species remained within normal limits. Importantly, retinal and optic nerve concentrations remained detectable in rabbits 7 days after final dosing, while the compound was eliminated systemically, supporting prolonged target tissue retention. These findings demonstrate that MP-004 is well tolerated and achieves effective retinal concentrations via topical delivery, overcoming a major barrier in retinal drug development. The favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile across species, including anatomically relevant models, supports MP-004s advancement toward regulatory preclinical studies and clinical translation as a non-invasive therapy for IRDs.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Participants completed a visual oddball task with pupillometry during transcutaneous auricular VNS (verum: cymba concha; sham: earlobe) with ~30-minute washout between conditions. Results: Older adults showed smaller baseline pupil diameter but larger normalized task-evoked responses than younger adults a priori. VNS produced age-specific effects: older adults demonstrated increased tonic pupil size throughout stimulation and reduced oddball-evoked responses, with stronger effects with more current. Younger adults showed no consistent VNS effects. Discussion: VNS affects LC-related physiological measures differently across age groups, with older adults showing more robust responses.

Accurate and fast characterization of their complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) is crucial to uncover the principles guiding their design. Yet, this task remains challenging, as random recombination and somatic mutations generate highly diverse CDR sequences that escape motif-based or structure-prediction approaches currently used to identify them. To overcome this hurdle, we employed two independent strategies that converged on the same conclusion. At the sequence level, we developed a deep learning model to identify nanobody CDRs directly from the primary sequence. At the structural level, we applied an energy decomposition method, revealing CDRs as residues highly uncoupled to the rest of the fold. Explainability analyses showed the network captured intrinsic CDR properties, which notably aligned with these energy values. CDRs emerge as fuzzy regions capable of adopting diverse conformational ensembles, from which a preferred state is selected upon antigen binding. This finding supports a model where chaos in both sequence and structure appears adaptive and disorder emerges as the hallmark of nanobody CDRs. This work aims to advance the definition of rules for the design of antigen binding regions, paving the way for the next-generation immune diagnostics and therapeutics.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Yet, most of the functions encoded in their genomes remain poorly characterized, limiting our understanding of the different roles they play in the human gut microbiome. Towards addressing this gap, we developed tools and methods for genome-wide transposon mutagenesis in Bacteroidales, including broad-range transposon vectors with several antibiotic selection markers, a dual conjugation-cloning donor strain, and protocols for convenient library generation in liquid media. We then created saturated, barcoded, insertion mutant libraries in the type strains of three key representatives of the main genera within Bacteroidales: Bacteroides uniformis (ATCC 8492), Phocaeicola vulgatus (ATCC 8482) and Parabacteroides merdae (ATCC 43184). Based on the dense transposon insertion profiles and a workflow for comparing essentialomes across species, we identified 275 core essential genes shared across the three species, and 163 species-specific essential genes, some of which could be explained by functional redundancy and alternative metabolic pathways. We further identified essential non-protein coding elements and essential protein domains with known and unknown functions. Finally, using insertion directionality bias, we could map potential toxic modalities in the three genomes, including toxin-antitoxin pairs, mobile elements encoding toxic products and enzymes leading to toxic metabolic intermediates. Overall, the tools, workflows and genome-wide resources reported here expand the experimental repertoire for characterizing genes in key bacteria of the human gut microbiome, and pave the way for the establishment of similar genetic toolkits for other gut bacteria.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

To investigate the genetic basis of SO2 tolerance in winery populations, 26 isolates from Australian wineries were phenotypically characterised and sequenced using long-read technology. Isolates showed a wide range of SO2 tolerance that correlated with phylogenetic clade and ploidy. Haplotype phasing of SSU1, a sulphite efflux pump linked to SO2 tolerance, identified nine distinct haplotypes, including the previously described high-tolerance H1 allele. Highly tolerant strains carried duplications of H1, frequently associated with retrotransposon insertions and chromosomal rearrangements at the SSU1 locus. Comparative analyses with laboratory-evolved strains confirmed that retrotransposons facilitated the acquisition of additional SSU1 copies. These findings suggest that transposon-mediated structural variation drives adaptive increases in SO2 tolerance in B. bruxellensis populations.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

While hormonal pathways and transcription factors governing nutrient-induced wing plasticity are known, how population density triggers developmental divergence remains unresolved. Here, we mechanistically dissect density-dependent wing morph determination, revealing tactile inter-individual contact as the primary signal. High-density conditions amplify gentle-touch frequency, which is detected by mechanosensitive ion channels NlNompC and NlNMDARs. Genetic silencing or pharmacological inhibition of these channels abolished density-induced long-winged morphogenesis. The conserved role of NlNompC in gentle-touch sensation was validated by rescuing tactile perception deficits in Drosophila nompC mutants. Crucially, NlNompC integrates tactile cues into insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS): crowding-driven mechanical stimuli upregulate NlIlp3, while suppressing NlInR2, to activate wing elongation programs. Epistasis experiments confirmed IIS as the key downstream pathway, with co-silencing NlInR2 or NlFoxO rescuing the short-winged phenotype induced by NlNompC knockdown or low population density, silencing NlIlp3 or NlInR1 rescuing the long-winged phenotype induced by high population density. Our work uncovers a mechano-endocrine axis linking tactile perception to developmental plasticity, bridging ecological cues with molecular pathways.

J.; Kennedy, S.", "abstract": "Transposons are parasitic nucleic acids present in most genomes. The ability of transposons to mobilize makes them a source of genetic diversity and a threat to genome integrity. Interestingly, mutations in the C. elegans gene mut-2/rde-3 increases the rate of transposition in the germline, but not in the soma, suggesting that the C. elegans germline and soma employ different strategies to regulate Tc1 transposition. Here, we develop fluorescence reporters for studying DNA transposon regulation in living C. elegans in a tissue-specific manner and we use candidate gene testing and genetic screening approaches to identify factors that regulate Tc1 mobility in the germline and/or the soma of the animal. We find that both cytoplasmic and nuclear components of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway silence Tc1 in the germline, but not in the soma. We identify a novel pathway involving the C. elegans ortholog of HNRNPC, and a gene we term suppressor of transposon mobilization (stm)-1, which regulates Tc1 primarily in the soma, likely by binding Tc1 RNA and preventing its splicing. Our findings reveal tissue-specific strategies for regulating parasitic nucleic acids and pave the way for future studies exploring how and why different tissues adopt different transposon silencing systems.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the N2-fixing system of Methanocaldococcus infernus, a deep-sea hyperthermophilic archaeon growing diazotrophically at 92 {degrees}C. This natively isolated nitrogenase has a melting temperature close to the water boiling point, with an extrapolated specific activity superior to mesophilic homologues. The crystal structures obtained at near-atomic resolution present the most simplified known nitrogenase, harbouring strategic hot spots for thermostability. It combines the structural traits of all three known nitrogenase isoforms, reinforcing the postulate that the archaeal enzyme predates modern versions. In contrast to structural homologues, the electron-transferring metallocofactor ''P-cluster'' is trapped in a rare state awaiting electron delivery, providing a detailed picture of the physiological state. The active site, harbouring the FeMo-cofactor catalyst, exhibits a mixture of the resting and ''turnover'' states, previously described solely in the bacterial vanadium and iron-only nitrogenases. Therefore, these results unify a mechanistic principle of all nitrogenases and highlight the advantages of the hyperthermostable nature of the archaeal enzyme, opening new avenues for further understanding of how nature splits the N2 triple bond.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

However, the large degrees of freedom of protein backbones complicate the sampling process during protein design. Machine learning-based models have made great strides in this problem, however due to their nature they tend to exploit rather than explore the data distribution used for training the neural networks. To address some of these challenges, we propose a new coarse grained protein structure representation generative method, DiffTopo, a diffusion model which increases the sampling efficiency and diversity. Combined with a backbone level protein generative model like RFdiffusion, novel protein folds can be generated rapidly, allowing for efficient exploration of the designable topology space. Interestingly, we have discovered that by mirroring the topological organization of native proteins using a pipeline named MirrorTopo, we can readily expand the known fold space. We generated and experimentally characterized 30 different novel topologies from DiffTopo and 6 different novel mirror topologies from MirrorTopo. The developed framework relying on low resolution sampling provides new means for fold exploration challenges, which could in principle enhance our knowledge of the first principles of protein structure and folding, as well as create new opportunities for functional design.", "date": "2025-10-10", "journal": ""}

Microscopy revealed severe hyphal distortions including swelling and branching abnormalities, following exposure to EU07 cell pellets. Transcriptomic analysis after 6 h of treatment identified 1,264 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 732 downregulated and 532 upregulated. Genes encoding secondary metabolite biosynthesis enzymes, including trichothecene (TRI) cluster genes, cytochrome P450s, and transporters, were strongly repressed. Key metabolic pathways, such as amino acid catabolism and mitochondrial transporters (e.g., 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier protein), also showed reduced expression. Conversely, genes associated with oxidative stress responses, detoxification, and membrane transport were induced, reflecting a compensatory survival strategy. These results demonstrate that EU07 disrupts F. graminearum both morphologically and at the transcriptional level, suppressing virulence-associated pathways while triggering stress adaptation.
