One shared behavior between CD8+ T cells and NK cells is clonal expansion, where a single stimulated cell proliferates rapidly to form a diverse population of cells. For example, clones derived from single cells are most abundant during expansion when they are primarily CD27- for NK cells and CD62L- for T cells, phenotypes derived from precursor CD27+ and CD62L+ cells, respectively. Here we determined the mechanistic rules involving proliferation, cell death, and differentiation of endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells in the expansion phase of the response to MCMV infection. We found that the interplay between cell proliferation and cell death of mature CD27- NK cells and a highly proliferative CD27-Ly6C- mature subtype and intrinsic stochastic fluctuations in these processes play key roles in regulating the heterogeneity and population of the NK cell subtypes. Furthermore, we estimate rates for maturation of endogenous NK cells in homeostasis and in MCMV infection and found that only NK cell growth rates, and not differentiation rates, are appreciably increased by MCMV. Taken together, these results quantify the differences between the kinetics of NK cell antigen-specific expansion from that of CD8+ T cells and unique mechanisms that give rise to the observed heterogeneity in NK cell clones generated from single NK cells in the expansion phase.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Understanding MTBC genetic diversity is crucial for insights into its adaptation and traits related to survival, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. While it is known that within-MTBC diversity is characterised by large deletions found only in certain lineages (regions of difference [RDs]), a comprehensive pangenomic analysis incorporating both coding and non-coding regions remains unexplored. We utilised a curated dataset representing various MTBC genomes, including under-represented lineages, to quantify the full diversity of the MTBC pangenome. The MTBC was found to have a small, closed pangenome with distinct genomic features and RDs both between lineages (as previously known) and between sub-lineages. The accessory genome was identified to be a product of genome reduction, showing both divergent and convergent deletions. This variation has implications for traits like virulence, drug resistance, and metabolism. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the MTBC pangenome, highlighting the importance of genome reduction in its evolution, and underlines the significance of genomic variations in determining the pathogenic traits of different MTBC lineages.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following stress is thought to cause condensation and stress granule formation through mRNA-sequence-dependent interactions, leading to disproportionate condensation of long mRNAs. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNAs condense in response to multiple stresses in budding yeast with minor length dependence and often without stress granule formation. New transcripts escape mRNP condensation, enabling their selective translation. Inhibiting translation initiation causes formation of mRNP condensates that are distinct from stress granules and P-bodies; these translation-initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are omnipresent, even in unstressed cells. Stress-induced mRNAs are excluded from TIICs due to the timing of their expression, indicating determinants of escape that are independent of sequence.

The present research aimed to identify cognitive tests in which performance is associated with objective sleep quality or quantity, focusing on cognitive tests designed to evaluate the earliest cognitive changes in dementia. Methods: We recruited younger and older adults and remotely monitored their sleep patterns for 7 consecutive days using wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries. On day 7, participants completed a battery of cognitive tests, which included the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), the Prodromal Alzheimer's and Mild Cognitive Impairment battery from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), and the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST), designed to tax pattern separation. The older adults were also assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Results: The final sample included 81 younger adults (mean age: 20.12, SD = 1.99) and 34 older adults (mean age: 65.56, SD = 9.57). There were no significant relationships between sleep and cognitive performance in the younger adults. In the older adults, there were significant correlations between total sleep time and PVT and MST performance. MoCA scores were correlated with performance on CANTAB and MST. Total sleep time also predicted MST performance in the older adults when controlling for age and gender. Conclusions: Performance on cognitive tests designed to assess pattern separation are sensitive to older adults sleep duration and the early cognitive changes associated with dementia. MST should be evaluated for potential use as a clinical trial outcome measure for sleep-promoting treatments in older adults.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

While typically measured experimentally via self-reported judgments, decision confidence is typically expressed through implicit sensorimotor behavior. Combining VR-based probabilistic learning paradigms with computational modeling across one exploratory and two pre-registered experiments (total N = 115), we examined whether post-decision gaze dynamics reflects an implicit second-order evaluation of decisions. Gaze direction was consistently aligned with participants' decisions about a target's upcoming location, and fluctuations in this alignment tracked the latent probability of the decision. Moreover, gaze exhibited computational hallmarks of confidence, reflecting a second-order ocular assessment of the decision. Directly comparing gaze-based confidence and explicit, reported confidence revealed a modest yet significant correlation, suggesting that the two are partially overlapping second-order processes. Notably, reported confidence showed higher metacognitive sensitivity and increased serial dependence across trials, while gaze-based confidence offered a more immediate, trial-specific readout of internal confidence. Importantly, we found that under increased uncertainty, gaze and decisions diverged more frequently, reflecting strategic ''hedging'' behavior. These findings suggest that post-decision gaze reflects an implicit, confidence-like behavior that partially overlaps with confidence judgments. Thus, the embodied interaction between decisions and ocular behavior supports flexible and adaptive behavior when learning and acting in a dynamic environment.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Recent studies showed that RBFOX proteins mediate the alternative splicing of PAC1, a critical HPA axis activator. Further, RBFOX1 dysfunction is linked to dysregulation of BDNF/TRKB, a pathway promoting neuroplasticity, neuronal survival, and stress resilience. Hence, RBFOX1 dysfunction may increase psychiatric disorder vulnerability via HPA axis dysregulation, leading to disrupted development and allostatic overload. To test this hypothesis, we generated a zebrafish rbfox1 loss of function (LoF) line and examined behavioural and molecular effects during development. We found that rbfox1 LoF mutants exhibited hyperactivity, impulsivity and heightened arousal, alongside alterations in proliferation - traits associated with neurodevelopmental and stress-related disorders. In adults, loss of rbfox1 function led to decreased fertility and survival, consistent with allostatic overload. At the molecular level, at larval stages rbfox1 mutants showed increased cortisol levels and disrupted expression of key stress-related genes (bdnf, trkb2, pac1a-hop, crhb, nr3c2). Pharmacological intervention targeting TRKB restored crhb and nr3c2 gene expression and hyperactive and hyperarousal behaviours. In adults, dysregulation of crhb, nr3c2 and bdnf/trkb2 genes was only seen following acute stress exposure. Our findings reveal a fundamental role for RBFOX1 in integrating stress responses through its regulation of BDNF/TRKB and neuroendocrine signalling.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Speech production, one of the most complex motor behaviors, relies on a feedback control process to detect sensory errors and trigger updates in a feedforward control process that implements compensations. However, the specific contributions of these critical processes in sensorimotor learning during continuous vocal production remain debated. Here, we used two experimental designs in five experiments to dissociate these mechanisms. First, we employed a serial-dependence design with randomized pitch perturbations, dissociating the influences of sensory errors and motor compensation on subsequent vocalizations on a trial-by-trial basis. We found that motor compensation, rather than sensory errors, predicted the compensatory responses in the subsequent trials, suggesting instantaneous serial learning mediated by updates in the feedforward process. This compensation-driven serial learning was generalized across productions of different vowel categories. Second, we further implemented a serial-dependence adaptation design in a sentential context, where auditory perturbation occurred only on a preceding syllable. Any learning effects in its subsequent syllable without pitch perturbation would reflect changes in the speech motor representation. Our results consistently revealed that compensation in the preceding syllable predicted pitch changes in the subsequent syllable, but only when the two adjacent syllables were embedded within a word boundary. Collectively, the study provides ecological-valid evidence supporting that error-based motor compensation, incorporating cognitive and linguistic constraints, directly regulates the speech motor representation and mediates the instantaneous serial learning in successive actions.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Efforts to quantify trade-offs are largely confined to phenotypic measurements and the identification of negative genetic-correlations among fitness-relevant traits. Here, we use time-series genomic data collected during experimental evolution in large, genetically diverse populations of Drosophila melanogaster to directly measure the manifestation of trade-offs in response to fluctuating selection on ecological timescales. Specifically, we first conducted a lab-based selection experiment to quantify a genome-wide signal of antagonistic pleiotropy elicited in response to shifting population densities and associated with reproduction and stress tolerance selection. In doing so, we identified a putative role of two cosmopolitan inversions in these trade-offs. We then conducted an independent experiment to show that a simple manipulation of increasing population density under controlled lab-based conditions identified loci that are relevant to selection during population expansion and collapse in a complex, semi-natural setting. In concert, our results reveal how adaptation in complex, natural environments can be coarse-grained in such a manner to drive repeatable and predictable patterns of genomic variation, and further add credence to models positing a role of generic fitness trade-offs in the maintenance of variation in natural populations.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

A previous clinical trial of Microbiome Transplant Therapy (MTT) in children with ASD and gastrointestinal (GI) issues revealed significant differences in plasma metabolomics between children with ASD and their typically developing (TD) counterparts, which diminished after MTT. The objective of this study was to reanalyze the plasma and fecal samples using updated metabolomics libraries at Metabolon, and applying a comprehensive panel of statistical methods. This approach aimed to provide deeper insights into ASD-related metabolic differences and the impact of MTT. The reanalysis identified more statistically significant metabolites and highlighted specific metabolites whose relative peak intensities differed between the ASD and TD groups, as well as metabolites with significant changes in peak intensity post-MTT. Several plasma metabolites, including sarcosine, iminodiacetate, caproate, and caprylate, initially showed significant differences between the ASD and TD groups but shifted to resemble TD levels after MTT treatment. In fecal samples, p-cresol sulfate and sphingolipids emerged as metabolites with altered intensities following MTT treatment. Multivariate Fisher's Discriminant Analysis (FDA) with leave-one-out cross-validation revealed that a set of metabolites-including p-cresol sulfate, hydroxyproline, and caprylate-could robustly classify the ASD and TD cohorts pre-treatment. However, after treatment, the same FDA model could not distinguish the two groups, as the FDA scores became similar to those of the TD cohort. Our findings enhance the understanding of ASD-associated metabolic changes and highlight the potential of MTT to influence these profiles. This underscores the importance of reanalysis using updated databases and robust statistical methods for comparative analysis. Further studies with larger cohorts and placebo-controlled trials are necessary to validate these results and explore the biochemical pathways involved, paving the way for personalized treatment approaches.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Using standardized cognitive tests and fMRI of different mnemonic tasks, we demonstrate a positive correlation between gf and map-like encoding of object positions learned piecemeal. The behavioral and neural geometry of object representations in the lower gf range was less consistent with any two-dimensional representation, congruent with a lack of relational integration at encoding. The specificity of the link between cognitive maps and intelligence to relational processing was further supported by comparisons to non-relational mnemonic processing in the hippocampus during item recognition.

However, we lack a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988) (H&A), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When H&A's model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering, one feature of the model (with at least some experimental support) emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that H&A's signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus' informativeness (called Gain) with a second factor (called Need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future.

Human patients with mutations in XDH develop xanthinuria which can lead to xanthine stones in the kidney, recurrent urinary tract infections, and renal failure. Currently there are no therapies for treating human XDH deficiency. Thus, understanding mechanisms that maintain purine homeostasis is an important goal of human health. Here, we used the nematode C. elegans to model human XDH deficiency using 2 clinically relevant paradigms: Moco deficiency or loss-of-function mutations in xdh-1, the C. elegans ortholog of XDH. Both Moco deficiency and xdh-1 loss of function caused the formation of autofluorescent xanthine stones in C. elegans. Surprisingly, only 2% of xdh-1 null mutant C. elegans developed a xanthine stone, suggesting additional pathways may regulate this process. To uncover such pathways, we performed a forward genetic screen for mutations that enhance the penetrance of xanthine stone formation in xdh-1 null mutant C. elegans. We isolated multiple loss-of-function mutations in the gene sulp-4 which encodes a sulfate permease homologous to human SLC26 anion exchange proteins. We demonstrated that SULP-4 acts cell-nonautonomously in the excretory cell to limit xanthine stone accumulation. Interestingly, sulp-4 mutant phenotypes were suppressed by mutations in genes that encode for cystathionase (cth-2) or cysteine dioxygenase (cdo-1), members of the sulfur amino acid catabolism pathway required for production of sulfate, a substrate of SULP-4. We propose that sulfate accumulation caused by sulp-4 loss of function promotes xanthine stone accumulation. We speculate that sulfate accumulation causes osmotic imbalance, creating conditions in the intestinal lumen that favor xanthine stone accumulation. Supporting this model, a mutation in osm-8 that constitutively activates the osmotic stress response also promoted xanthine stone accumulation in an xdh-1 mutant background. Thus, our work establishes a C. elegans model for human XDH deficiency and identifies the sulfate permease sulp-4 as a critical player controlling xanthine stone accumulation.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Beyond amino acid composition, the blocky patterns of P/Q residues are required for the segregation from nuclear speckles. Among human IDRs exhibiting PQ-block patterns, BRD4 IDR shows strong sequence similarity to the SFPQ IDR, and exhibits comparable segregation activity. Molecular dynamics simulation suggests that the PQ-blocky patterns required for the paraspeckle segregation do not correlate with the IDR characteristics necessary for self-assembly. Thus, these data suggest that the PQ-blocky patterns in IDRs represent a previously uncharacterized property that contributes to MLO independence, possibly through a mechanism distinct from the conventional phase separation-promoting function of IDRs.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

M.; Franklin, E.; Kitzinger, G. K.; Lorgeoux, C.; Billoir, E.; Felten, V.", "abstract": "Phthalates are chemical products used as additives in the synthesis of plastics to increase their flexibility and resistance. Among the most frequently detected phthalates in the environment is dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Although ubiquitous in freshwater environments at concentrations in the ng/L to g/L range, studies on the effects of DBP on Daphnia magna have overlooked the potential effects of exposure at low concentrations (g/L order) and without solvent. Our work focuses on the chronic effects of DBP on life history traits (survival, growth, reproduction) in the freshwater model species, D. magna (Crustacea). Organisms were exposed to two exposure regimes: from the beginning of embryonic development or from the adult stage, at the third brood, when most of the energy investment in growth is complete. The results obtained show that the DBP exposure regime is an essential parameter in the effects on D. magna life history traits. While no significant response was observed in organisms exposed at the adult stage, disturbances to survival, growth and reproduction were observed at concentrations as low as the g/L range in organisms exposed at the beginning of embryonic development. The results also demonstrated that exposure to a concentration gradient of DBP results in different dose-dependent response typologies, depending on the life history traits measured. For survival, the dose-response relationship was non-monotonic, with greater juvenile mortality at intermediate concentrations (100, 280 and 500 g/L) than at higher concentrations (1000 and 2000 g/L). For effects on growth and reproduction, the responses followed classic monotonic dose-response relationships with low sensitivities. At the end of the experiment, the EC10-25d values were 1.01 g/L for reproduction and 79.22 g/L for growth. However, when calculated at earlier timepoints, the EC10-4d and the EC10-7d for growth were 0.25 g/L and 1.16 g/L. Furthermore, projecting these results to the population level suggests that exposure to DBP from early embryonic development leads to a decrease in growth rate and a change in population structure.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Endogenously generated nitric oxide (NO) is highly cardioprotective, but protection is not replicated by nitroso-vasodilators (e.g., nitrates, nitroprusside) used in clinical practice, highlighting specificity in NO-based signaling and untapped therapeutic potential. Signaling by NO is mediated largely by S-nitrosylation, entailing specific enzymes that form and degrade S-nitrosothiols in proteins (SNO-proteins), termed nitrosylases and denitrosylases, respectively. SNO-CoA Reductase 2 (SCoR2; product of the Akr1a1 gene) is a recently discovered protein denitrosylase. Genetic variants in SCoR2 have been associated with cardiovascular disease, but its function is unknown. Here we show that mice lacking SCoR2/Akr1a1 exhibit robust protection in an animal model of MI. SCoR2 regulates ketolytic energy availability, antioxidant levels and polyol homeostasis via S-nitrosylation of key metabolic effectors. Human cardiomyopathy shows reduced SCoR2 expression and an S-nitrosylation signature of metabolic reprogramming, mirroring SCoR2-/- mice. Deletion of SCoR2 thus coordinately reprograms multiple metabolic pathways--ketone body utilization, glycolysis, pentose phosphate shunt and polyol metabolism--to limit infarct size, establishing SCoR2 as a novel regulator in the injured myocardium and a potential drug target.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

To perform these functions, they rely on a hierarchical organization, which spans molecules, cytoskeletal networks, adhesion complexes and junctional networks up to the tissue scale. While the molecular understanding and ability to manipulate cytoskeletal components within cells is rapidly increasing, how these components integrate to control tissue mechanics is far less understood, partly due to the disconnect between theoretical models of sub-cellular dynamics and those at a tissue scale. To fill this gap, here we propose a formalism bridging active-gel models of the actomyosin cortex and 3D vertex-like models at a tissue scale. We show that this unified framework recapitulates a number of seemingly disconnected epithelial time-dependent phenomenologies, including stress relaxation following stretch/unstretch maneuvers, active flattening after buckling, or nonreciprocal and non-affine pulsatile contractions. We further analyze tissue dynamics probed by a novel experimental setup operating in a pressure-controlled ensemble.

Here, we devised a novel framework using mouse and human gene expression to build a quantitative common space and apply it to models of neurodegenerative disease. Methods: We trained a variational autoencoder on mouse spatial transcriptomics, and embedded mouse and human gene orthologs in the model's latent space. We computed a latent cross-species similarity matrix for translation and compared translated maps to human ground truth evidence. Findings: We established the validity of our model based on anatomical homology. Independent of species, brain areas with similar latent patterns clustered together, improving the homology of known anatomical pairs, and preserving principles of brain organisation. Importantly, brain alterations in mouse disease models predicted human patterns of brain changes in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We further determined the best mouse model for the AD patients, based on how well the translations matched the patient data, across multiple models and timepoints. Interpretation: Our work provides i) a quantitative bridge across evolutionary divergence between the human and the predominant preclinical species, ii) a predictive framework to help design and evaluate disease models.

The VTC2 and VTC3 genes play key roles in this process: VTC2 encodes GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (GGP), the rate-limiting enzyme in ascorbate biosynthesis, and VTC3 encodes a putative protein kinase/phosphatase with an unknown function. Here, we investigated their functional and genetic relationship. In vtc3 mutants, VTC2 transcription and GGP activity were slightly enhanced, suggesting that VTC3 is not required for VTC2 expression. Additionally, the vtc3 mutation had negligible effects on the transcriptome and the activity of enzymes involved in ascorbate redox cycle regulation, narrowing down the possible roles of VTC3 in ascorbate biosynthesis. Under low-light conditions, ascorbate levels were lower in vtc2 than in vtc3 mutants, but vtc2 retained the ability to increase ascorbate levels under high-light stress, unlike vtc3. The simultaneous knockout of VTC2 and VTC3 further reduced ascorbate levels compared to single mutants and severely impaired light stress-induced ascorbate accumulation, resulting in impaired non-photochemical quenching and enhanced photooxidative damage. These findings highlight the additive effects of VTC2 and VTC3 on ascorbate biosynthesis and stress tolerance. The vtc2 vtc3 double mutants provide a valuable model for further elucidating the physiological roles of ascorbate in plants.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

However, these treatments can alter production of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs), which often contain pro-inflammatory biomolecules. In this study, we examined how the clinically-relevant antibiotics meropenem, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin impacted BEV production from a urinary tract infection-associated Escherichia coli strain (CFT073 [WAM2267]) and a meningitis-associated strain (K1 RS218). BEVs from both strains caused a dose-dependent increase in expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, priming the endothelium for interactions with immune cells. Blockade of toll-like receptor 4 revealed that this receptor was responsible for BEV-endothelial interactions. Treatment with meropenem, a {beta}-lactam antibiotic, increased production of BEVs from strain K1 RS218. Furthermore, meropenem treatment caused strain CFT073 [WAM2267] to produce BEVs with heightened stimulatory capacity, possibly by amplifying the content of lipoprotein Lpp in these BEVs as measured by mass spectrometry. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the interplay between antibiotic treatment and the effects of the resulting BEVs on endothelial ICAM-1 expression.

This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying SCF and GCSF therapeutic effects using transcriptomic analysis. Aged APPPS1 mice received daily subcutaneous injections of SCF and GCSF or vehicle for 12 days. RNA was extracted from brain tissue on day 13 for gene chip analysis. Age - matched wild - type, WT, mice served as controls. Data were analyzed using TAC, STRING v12 {middle dot} 0, Reactome, and ShinyGO 0 {middle dot} 77.

Methods: In this study, we aimed to investigate comparative proteome profiling of a diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced HCC model in male and female Balb/c mice. We extracted proteins from liver tissue of DEN treated male and female mice and their corresponding controls and subjected them to mass spectrometry and subsequent bio-informatics analyses. Results: We identified 170 and 233 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in female and male mice, respectively. We identified chemical carcinogenesis and cortical cytoskeleton as the shared pathways between the two groups. In addition, we identified distinct signaling pathways in DEN-treated male and female mice. Female mice showed enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid biosynthesis, metabo-lism and degradation and cytochrome P450 clusters. In contrast, in male mice, these pathways were enriched in cholesterol metabolism, coagulation and mRNA processing. Further, we identified top ten genes ranked by highest maximal clique centrality, by protein-protein interaction analysis of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in both sexes. Of these hub genes, female mice showed upregulation of NDUFA8 and ATP5H and were associated with poor patient survival. On the other hand, In DEN-treated male mice upregulation of FGG, FGA, HPX and SERPINC1 were associated with poor survival. Conclusion: In conclusion, our research provides gender-specific proteomic signatures in DEN-induced HCC. The identification of proteins associated cholesterol metabolism and coagulation in males, and mitochondrial complex I proteins in females as prognostic markers suggests novel therapeutic targets that may inform gender-tailored treatment strategies for HCC.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Numerous antibody-drug conjugates have received FDA approval; however, clinical resistance arises. Resistance mechanisms include decreased expression or mutation of the antibody target, impaired payload release, or increased expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters associated with multidrug resistance. We therefore sought to characterize the interactions of ABC multidrug transporters with ADC payloads. Methods: We performed a high-throughput screen with 27 common ADC payloads using cells lines expressing ABC transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by ABCB1) or ABCG2 (encoded by ABCG2). Confirmatory assays were also performed using cells transfected to express P-gp, ABCG2, or MRP1 (encoded by ABCC1). Results: Several commonly used ADC payloads were substrates of P-gp, including calicheamicin gamma1, monomethyl auristatin E, DM1, and DM4. All the pyrrolobenzodiazepines tested-SJG136, SGD-1882, SG2057, and SG3199-were substrates of P-gp, ABCG2, and MRP1. The modified anthracyclines nemorubicin and its metabolite PNU-159682 were poorly transported by both ABCB1 and ABCG2 and displayed nanomolar to picomolar toxicity. Further, we found that the efficacy of the FDA-approved ADC mirvetuximab soravtansine, with DM4 as the toxic payload, was decreased in cell lines expressing P-gp. Duocarmycin DM and PNU-159682 were exquisitely toxic to a panel of 99 cancer cell lines of varying origins. Conclusion: Several commonly used ADC payloads can be transported by ABC transporters, potentially leading to transporter-mediated drug resistance in patients. Future ADCs should be developed using payloads that are not ABC transporter substrates.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

We then treated repeat abundance as a quantitative trait and performed genome-wide association studies to map the genetic basis of copy number variation across more than 400 repeat families. We jointly analyzed these results using a meta-GWAS approach, revealing both cis-acting variants and over 50 trans-acting loci that regulate repeat abundance genome-wide.

Atg1 is a key regulator of the early phases of autophagy, especially under nitrogen starvation. The role of Atg1 in regulating morphology, stress resistance, or virulence in T. asahii, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we generated three atg1 gene-deficient T. asahii mutants and investigated their phenotypic characteristics to reveal the role of Atg1 in T. asahii. The atg1 gene-deficient mutants exhibited no growth defects under high-temperature or various chemical stress conditions, including antifungal drugs. The mutants exhibited an increased proportion of hyphal cells when cultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SB), a medium commonly used for fungi.

The virulence of these atg1 gene-deficient mutants was maintained in a silkworm infection model. Furthermore, all three generated atg1 gene-deficient mutants exhibited consistent phenotypes.

S.; Luck, S. J.", "abstract": "Working memory is a core feature of cognition that enables items to be maintained and manipulated over short durations of time. Stored information can be binary, such as the presence or absence of an object, or multivalued, such as the graded intensity or location of a feature. Remarkably, there are currently no computational models of working memory that can robustly maintain both the graded intensity and spatial location of a stored item. Here, we show how this limitation can be overcome if neurons contain multiple bistable dendritic compartments. We first illustrate the core mechanism in a simple network architecture for both a spiking model with conductance-based dendrites and a rate-based model that permits analytic understanding. We then implement this mechanism within a \"ring model\" architecture for spatial working memory, in which neurons are arranged in a one-dimensional line or ring such that the spatial location of an item is encoded by the set of neurons that are active. In contrast to classic ring models, which encode the binary presence and continuous location of an item, we show that the multi-dendrite-neuron model can robustly (without fine tuning and with minimal drift in response to noise) encode both the amplitude and the location of an item in working memory. This work provides a solution to the problem of encoding graded information in spatial working memory and demonstrates how dendritic computation can increase the capacity and robustness of working memory.\n\nSignificance StatementWorking memory refers to the ability to actively hold information. This ability provides a fundamental basis for cognitive functions like decision-making and recall. We focus on the modeling of working memory with two different dimensions, such as a hue with its intensity. Conventionally, two dimensions are represented by local activity and activity amplitude. However, previous models fail unless requiring unrealistic parameter fine-tuning. Here, we incorporate dendritic bistability, where each dendrite acts as a separate memory unit, into the classical model. The model can store both the location and amplitude of an input without parameter fine-tuning. This work highlights the power of dendritic computation.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Their historical significance, linked to the rise of the Anglo-Norman era (1093-1286 CE) in Scotland, and the historical complexities of surname adoption post-Norman conquest of England, justifies the need for a comprehensive understanding of the genetic history of the Hay noble lineage. This study focuses on examining the patterns of paternal inheritance in lineages with the Hay surname. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Y-chromosome data that is publicly available on the Family Tree DNA (FTDNA) platform, and specific FTDNA surname projects, as well as looking in more detail at three well-documented male-line descendants of William II HAY, 1st Earl of Erroll, (d. 1201) that have been verified to a high degree of confidence. Our results reveal that all descendants of William II HAY, 1st Earl of Erroll, (d. 1201) derive from the multigenerational Y-SNPs R1a - YP6500 (plus equivalent SNPs BY33394 / FT2017) and R1a - FTT161. Furthermore, subclades of R1a - FTT161 have been identified that confirm direct male-line descent from two of William II HAYs sons. Subclade R1a - BY199342 (plus equivalents) confirms direct male-line descent from David HAY, 2nd Earl of Erroll, (d. 1241), and subclade R1a - FTA7312 confirms direct male line decent from Robert HAY of Erroll. The result also confirms that the Hay noble lineage shares the Y-SNP R1a - YP4138 (estimated to have occurred 832 CE) with several non-Hay testers that have surnames of Norman origin, therefore, providing further evidence to support the Norman origin hypothesis for these surnames. In addition to the identification of multigenerational Y-SNPs associated to documented Hay noblemen, this study has observed significant Y-DNA haplogroup diversity among males with the surname Hay (plus associated spelling variants: Hays, Haye, Hayes, Hey and Haya). Our results show that only 22% of the men sampled (n=109) with the surname Hay (plus associated spelling variation) are descended from the 12th century progenitor of the noble Hay lineage of Scotland.

Our robust statistical analysis identified five significant connections, each exhibiting a linear decline in influence throughout the disease spectrum. We observed a progressive disruption of pathways from the Default Mode Network to the Medial Temporal Lobe, capturing a key psychophysiological mechanism underlying Alzheimers disease. These findings demonstrate the potential of our framework as a powerful tool for modeling network-level dynamics in neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

W. J.; van Weeren, L.", "abstract": "An independent evaluation of the spectroscopic properties, cellular performance, merits and pitfalls of the red fluorescent protein mScarlet3-H as compared to mScarlet3 is reported. mScarlet3-H was generated from mScarlet3 by a single M163H mutation. Purified mScarlet3-H is characterized by a molar coefficient of 79,040 M-1cm-1, a fluorescence quantum yield of 17.8%, molecular brightness of 14.1 and a heterogeneous multiexponential decay with an average fluorescence lifetime of 1 ns. Evaluation in living mammalian cells revealed a comparable maturation speed and efficiency of mScarlet3 and mScarlet3-H, but the overall cellular brightness of mScarlet3-H was 5-fold lower than that of mScarlet3. Photobleaching analysis in live cells revealed identical photobleaching kinetics of mScarlet3-H and mScarlet-H. The fluorescence intensity, fluorescence spectra and fluorescence lifetime of mScarlet3-H were found to be strongly pH-dependent between pH 4-8. The fluorescence lifetime increased from 1 ns to 3 ns in lowering the pH from 8 to 4 with a pK of ~6. The much lower lifetime of mScarlet3-H (~1 ns) as compared to mScarlet3 (~4 ns) allows dual fluorescence lifetime unmixing applications in single channel FLIM recordings in compartments with neutral to slightly alkaline pH. Furthermore, the strongly pH-dependent fluorescence lifetime of mScarlet3-H enables fluorescence lifetime-based pH sensing in a pH region between pH 5 to 7. With this property autophagy of the cytoplasm can be visualized by the pH-dependent fluorescence lifetime with mScarlet3-H accumulation in lysosomes. Potential useful applications and pitfalls regarding the special properties of mScarlet3-H are discussed.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Autophagosomes can still form in their absence, suggesting alternative mechanisms. NBR1, a selective autophagy receptor, has been shown to compensate for autophagy defects. Here, we examined NBR1 regulation under proteotoxic stress in mATG8s deficient HeLa cells. NBR1 levels were elevated in mATG8s knockout (KO) cells under basal conditions but decreased significantly after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This reduction was not prevented by lysosomal inhibition with BafA1, indicating a non-lysosomal mechanism. Silencing of RAB27A reduced basal NBR1 levels, and the effects of MG132 were no longer observed, likely due to already diminished NBR1. Remaining NBR1 localized to puncta positive for ubiquitin and the ESCRT-0 component HRS, suggesting involvement of a ubiquitin-dependent endosomal pathway. Overall, our results suggest that under proteotoxic stress and impaired autophagy, cells activate alternative routes, potentially involving unconventional secretion, to regulate NBR1 levels.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

In our previous study, we demonstrated that the molecular chaperone-like protein BSA reshapes the energy landscape of folded client proteins, increasing the population of their excited states. Building on this, we further explored chaperone-enzyme interactions and found that chaperones Spy and Hsp70 affected the conformational exchanges of folded lysozyme, leading to increased catalytic activity. Additionally, we observed that the influence of chaperones on enzyme activity extended to other chaperone-enzyme interactions. Molecular chaperones Hsp70, Spy, Hsp104, and Hsp20, enhanced the catalytic activity of diverse enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase (PHPT1), DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu pol), endonuclease CRISPR-Cas12a/Cas13a, and xylanase. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of chaperones in modulating the activity of folded enzymes, broadening the known functions and mechanisms of molecular chaperones in biological systems.

Here, we present SAME (Spatial Alignment of Multimodal Expression) that introduces space-tearing transforms, a framework for controlling localized topological disruptions during cross-sectional alignment. Using integer linear programming to maximize cell type matches across the modalities, we enhance cell-type alignment accuracy by 20% compared to existing methods while preserving biologically meaningful spatial relationships. Applied to protein-RNA integration in healthy tongue tissue and lung adenocarcinoma, SAME revealed cryptic immune subpopulations that were otherwise missed by RNA-only or protein-only classification. In a separate lung adenocarcinoma study, we assayed and integrated protein and metabolomic profiles, uncovering localized mevalonic acid upregulation specifically within tumor-macrophage spatial niches and identifying targeted metabolic crosstalk invisible to single-modality approaches.

A rise in intracellular Ca; activates a lipid scramblase that translocates PS from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This redistribution is enhanced by extracellular Anx A5 binding to cell surface PS. Depletion of PS in the inner leaflet weakens actin cortex-plasma membrane attachment mediated by ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins, as evidenced by the preferential localization of cortex detachment areas within PS-enriched regions at the surface of the cells. Weakening of the cortex-membrane connection by Anx A5 or by adding an inhibitor of the ERM proteins promotes osteoclast fusion. We propose that this pathway facilitates osteoclast fusion and other cell-cell fusions by promoting membrane deformations required for formation of prefusion membrane contacts. Additionally, the elevated tension in the cortex detachment region of the membrane, suggested by our theoretical analysis, promotes fusion pore expansion.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

We compared the performance of 14 predictor sets incorporating different sensor combinations and temporal processing methods (LandTrendr and CCDC) in random forest models using temporal cross-validation to assess extrapolation accuracy. The most parsimonious fusion model (LandTrendr + SAR + topography/soils) achieved RMSEs of 3.04 m for RH98, 13.38% for Cover and 0.34 for FHD, which was comparable to more complex models using HLS and CCDC. All models demonstrated good temporal transferability with minimal bias but tended to overestimate low values and underestimate high values, which muted the estimated magnitude of change. Annual canopy structure maps derived from the best model captured expected spatial patterns and were used in model-based estimators to quantify changes in areas impacted by elephants, timber harvesting, fuelwood extraction, and woody encroachment. Extending GEDI metrics with moderate-resolution sensors thus offers a viable approach for large-scale savanna monitoring and detecting change in high impact areas.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Roadless areas, i.e., portions of land 1 km farther from linear infrastructure, are increasingly recognized for their ecological value and potential role in closing this gap. Using OpenStreetMap data and environmental gradients derived from climate, soil, and topographic layers, we identified the extent of EU roadless areas and assessed their conservation value based on their capacity to complement the existing strict protection network in terms of environmental representativeness. We found that 11.5% of EU land is roadless, with only 18.9% of this already under strict protection. Integrating all roadless areas would raise strict protection coverage to 12.7% and improve representation of abiotic environmental space from 78.8% to 94.4%. However, most roadless areas are extremely fragmented and redundant with respect to their abiotic features. While roadless areas offer a critical opportunity to expand the strict protection network, they cannot solely meet conservation goals. A balanced strategy that includes restoration, coordination across governance levels, and prioritization based on other biodiversity features is essential to effectively meet EU conservation commitments.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

We used both interaction and sex-stratified analyses in disease association and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including the X chromosome. Our analyses revealed sex-specific differences in associations between retinal traits, cardiometabolic risk factors, and disease outcomes. Several phenotypes showed prognostic value for mortality and cardiovascular endpoints, predominantly in one sex, illustrating the limitations of sex-agnostic analyses. Genetic analyses revealed differences in genetic architectures, with females exhibiting higher heritability and a greater number of associated loci, as well as sex-specific trait-gene associations.

Twenty key IR-related genes were selected from the literature, and their microRNA regulators were predicted using five computational tools. These predictions were validated using experimentally supported databases (TarBase and miRTarBase), and each miRNA-gene interaction was scored. Sixteen high-confidence microRNAs were shortlisted based on cumulative prediction and validation scores.

We found that EAAT1 is broadly expressed across AML cell lines and patient samples, with enrichment in M4 and M5 subtypes and increasing levels following chemotherapy treatment. Pharmacological inhibition of EAAT1 impaired AML cell viability in vitro, but metabolomic profiling and nutrient rescue experiments showed that these effects were independent of intracellular aspartate levels. Moreover, AML cells cultured in aspartate-free medium maintained proliferation and did not become more sensitive to chemotherapy. EAAT1 inhibition in mice increased bone marrow plasma aspartate levels, confirming inhibition of cellular aspartate uptake, but did not affect growth or chemosensitivity of MLL-AF9-expressing AML cells in vivo.

Although global biodiversity encompasses all life, from tiny nitrogen-fixing bacteria to emergent rainforest trees, birds have several characteristics that make them a frequent focus of such monitoring efforts. In particular, birds frequently give diagnostic, species-specific vocalizations that simplify monitoring, they perform a number of critical ecosystem services, they are widely distributed in most ecosystems with strong representation on all continents, and the basic ecology, conservation status, populations, and distributions of many species is well known; birds thus provide a window into the underlying health and habitats of the systems under study. How best to summarize biodiversity monitoring results is a research question that has led to the development of approaches that incorporate species' IUCN Red List threat assessments into site-level biodiversity scores. Notably, birds' vocal behavior means that they can be effectively surveyed at scale with passive acoustic monitoring, and the potential to link such monitoring with automated identification and therefore quickly generate site-level biodiversity scores is an appealing approach to implement rigorous evaluations of global biodiversity. Yet, while many of the world's birds are suffering worrisome population declines, the vast majority of species (78%) are still ranked \"Least Concern\" by the Red List. In an effort to develop a species scoring system that would be more conducive to such site-level valuations, we integrated key databases of species' population status assessments, exposure to known vulnerability factors, and their functional and phylogenetic uniqueness to provide quantitative summaries of their conservation significance.

Interspecific hybridization is common between genetically related organisms, especially once reproductive barriers such as spatial isolation have been removed. We used genotyping-by-sequencing data to assess outcomes of hybridization between several Leuciscidae minnow species and to identify to what extent land use type and environmental variables influence the frequency of hybridization. We found that both two-species and multi-species hybridization was widespread; hybrids were sampled at all 25 sampling sites and made up almost 30% of all individuals sampled. While most species hybridized with at least one other sampled species, the amount of hybridization was variable. We used logistic regression to estimate the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on hybridization, and found significant but weak relationships between hybridization and environmental factors. This research improves our understanding of hybridization dynamics in species-rich clades like the Leuciscidae with low reproductive isolation, and points to the need for additional work to better understand predictors of hybridization in multi-species hybrid zones.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

While most previous studies have focused on protein sequence divergence as a likely driver of PMPZ incompatibilities, reproductive proteomes may also diverge compositionally and/or quantitatively. Here, we combine quantitative proteomics, molecular evolutionary analyses, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) modeling to predict the molecular basis of reproductive incompatibilities between Drosophila mojavensis and D. arizonae. We demonstrate multidimensional divergence in reproductive proteomes including changes at the sequence, compositional, and quantitative levels. We further demonstrate that three divergent male seminal fluid proteins affect the size of the insemination reaction mass and/or fertilization success in D. arizonae. Despite high sequence divergence, predicted protein-protein interactions involving a conserved set of proteases and/or protease inhibitors were predicted to be maintained in heterospecific crosses. In contrast, predicted interspecies protein incompatibilities arose from proteome compositional divergence, suggesting that such changes may play a disproportionate role in PMPZ incompatibilities, at least for the subset of the interactome that we tested. Furthermore, extensive quantitative divergence, particularly for proteases and inhibitors, suggests pervasive stoichiometric mismatches in heterospecific matings. Altogether, our findings indicate that reproductive proteins are evolutionarily labile at multiple levels, and that compositional and quantitative divergence, rather than sequence changes alone, may be central to the early evolution of reproductive isolation.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Such analyses have provided clarity where traditional morphological analyses may not have, and have been instrumental in a range of evolutionary, systematic, and taxonomic studies for providing clarity to evolutionary relationships. One such case where evolutionary relationships are poorly understood is in the mosquito genus Aedes. Although this medically important genus of insects has received significant study, the majority of research has focused on those relatively few species that are invasive and transmit disease. As a result, the classification of the genus has been contentious, with numerous taxonomic changes over the last two decades being undertaken and reversed based entirely on analyses of somewhat limited morphological data. As a result, we conducted a literature review of molecular phylogenies and evaluated classificatory hypotheses under a framework based on observations of frequently occurring relationships among mosquito genera and subgenera. We found that molecular phylogenies consistently reflect two distinct clades of Aedes mosquitoes, representing three total clades in the tribe Aedini. We discuss these results in the context of ongoing debates over Aedes taxonomic nomenclature and propose three potential paths forward.

Several live-attenuated FPV vaccine viruses originated from early 1960s isolates or were a recombinant of an early virus, and many sequences in databases proved to be vaccine-derived. The sequences of wild viruses showed that FPV-like strains evolved at ~25% the rate seen for CPV in dogs, and the higher rate of CPV evolution was consistent since 1979 when a genetic variant became widespread. The common ancestor of the CPV lineage was related to FPVs from Europe, and contained several unique host-adaptive capsid changes associated with canine transferrin receptor type-1 binding. Although the FPV vaccine strains are around 60 years old, little selection for antigenic variation was observed. The distinct evolutionary patterns of these closely related viruses circulating for decades in different hosts emphasizes the complex evolution associated with viral epidemic emergence and spread in endemic and new hosts.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

However, those models are usually developed in a neontological framework, despite the increasing number of datasets covering both extant and fossil taxa, as well as the fact that many clades are entirely extinct. In this paper, we develop the F-ClaDS model, a Fossilized-Birth-Death (FBD) version of the cladogenetic diversification rate shift (ClaDS) model, in BEAST2. ClaDS estimates partially inherited branch-specific rates from a phylogeny, providing a nuanced and detailed perspective of the variations in diversification across the tree. Our extension allows the integration of fossil samples directly into the phylogeny. We apply our new implementation to a dataset of 36 Nimravidae, a fully extinct carnivoraform clade that spanned from the Early Eocene to the Late Miocene, which species had different degrees of specialisation to a carnivorous diet. We show that using different tree priors does not affect substantially the topology of the inferred trees, but affects the ages of nodes and tips, as well as branch-lengths. F-ClaDS also recovers more species as sampled ancestors than the homogeneous FBD model. The branches with the highest speciation and extinction rates are those corresponding to the hypercarnivorous clades (Hoplophoneus and the barbourofelins), supporting the view that specialization to a hypercarnivorous diet can spur speciation, but also increase extinction risk, especially during times of global ecosystem change, potentially due to a high position in the trophic chain.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

While neontological analyses are often used to test this hypothesis, extant data only captures the time-averaged signal of surviving lineages. More nuanced tests require paired and longitudinal climatic and organismal data from the fossil record. Here, we developed the most comprehensive phenomic dataset of pan-carnivorans incorporating fossil and extant data (118 extant and 81 extinct species) to test hypotheses that Cenozoic climatic change influenced the tempo and mode of the cranial, appendicular, and axial skeleton. We found equal support for two release and radiate models, where skeletal evolution transitioned from an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to Brownian motion at the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT) and the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT). Disparity-through-time analyses reveal that the EOT led to decreased subclade disparity whereas the MCCT led to increased disparity. Our results suggest that climate transitions facilitated the diversification of skeletal phenomes under a long-fuse model. Specifically, EOT-induced extinction of coeval stem pan-carnivorans released crown carnivorans from a constrained adaptive zone, resulting in phenotypic diversification among families from the Early Oligocene to Mid-Miocene. Intrafamilial skeletal phenome diversification did not occur for another 20 million years until after the MMCT. Overall, the hierarchical progression of ecological diversification across the Cenozoic significantly influenced the establishment of modern carnivorans.

Using Drosophila genetics, we discovered that canonical PRC1 and variant RING1 complexes ubiquitylate H2A at distinct genomic regions. We established that the sole Drosophila PCGF protein specific for variant RING1 complexes, which we named Siesta, is not required for epigenetic repression of developmental genes, but controls larval locomotion independently of H2A ubiquitylation. Leveraging a massively parallel transgenic approach, we demonstrated that H2A ubiquitylation has minimal impact on transcriptional repression.

This balance requires spatial and temporal regulation of cell fate and transcriptional regulators to act as key mediators of lineage progression. The transcription factor Mef2 is a key activator of myogenic differentiation across vertebrates and invertebrates. However, the mechanisms that spatially restrict Mef2 expression within the developing niche to limit muscle progenitor (MP) commitment towards differentiation remains less well characterized. Using the developmental flight muscle progenitor niche in Drosophila, a system that parallels vertebrate myogenesis, we investigated the transcriptional and spatial regulation of MP fate at a developmental timepoint when Mef2 expression begins to rise but precedes overt differentiation. We identified a spatially distinct subpopulation of MPs with low Mef2 expression and elevated Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Within the broader MP pool, graded Wnt activity emerged as a key source of Mef2 heterogeneity: high Wnt activity led to strong repression of Mef2 via Armadillo/{beta}-catenin and TCF-dependent regulation. Moderate Wnt activity, meanwhile, not only repressed Mef2 expression but also sustained expression of zfh1, a conserved transcription factor linked to MP maintenance and adult muscle stem cell identity. Contrary to its well-established role in promoting myogenesis, Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in this early spatial context instead promotes a less committed state, leading to a subset of MPs with particular low Mef2 level. These findings highlight greater spatial complexity within the developing muscle progenitor niche than previously recognized, with potential implications for conserved strategies of muscle stem cell regulation across species.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The purpose of the study was to identify microbial signatures unique to T2DM patients and non-diabetic individuals, to compare microbial profiles between the two groups and to investigate how gut microbiota may be related to inflammation associated with T2DM. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 51 T2DM patients and 99 non-diabetic South African individuals. Faecal samples were collected and analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the gut microbiota. Blood samples were obtained to perform HbA1c, CRP and ferritin tests. Bioinformatic and statistical analyses were performed to identify differences in microbial composition and diversity between the two groups. Results The gut microbiota in T2DM patients was predominantly composed of Firmicutes (47.7%), Bacteroidota (37.5%), and Proteobacteria (11.4%), while the non-diabetic group showed a slightly different microbial profile with higher Bacteroidota (41.9%) and a notable presence of Actinobacteriota (4.5%). Abundant families in the T2DM group included Bacteroidaceae (22.8%), Prevotellaceae (7.4%), Enterobacteriaceae (7.4%), Erysipelotrichaceae (6.0%) and Lachnospiraceae (5.2%). The non-diabetic group exhibited dominant families such as Lachnospiraceae 26.7%, Prevotellaceae (25.3%), Bacteroidaceae (12.7%), Ruminococcaceae (9.5%) and Oscillospiraceae (3.8%). At the genus level, Bacteroides (22.8%), Escherichia-Shigella (5.0%), Holdemanella (4.8%), Phascolarctobacterium (3.2%) and Blautia (2.8%) were prevalent in the T2DM group, while Prevotella_9 (22.1%), Bacteroides (12.7%), Agathobacter (6.7%), Blautia (6.3%) and Faecalibacterium (5.1%) were dominant in the non-diabetic group. Differential abundance testing revealed 5 phyla, 16 families, and 25 genera that were either enriched/depleted in T2DM patients relative to non-diabetic individuals. The comparison of alpha diversity metrics between the two groups revealed significant differences across all four measures (P < 0.001), with non-diabetic individuals showing higher values than T2DM patients. HbA1c and CRP levels showed correlations with the relative abundance of various gut microbes at various phyla, family, and genus levels, as well as with all alpha diversity metrics.

Previous studies have characterized H. saltator OR (HsOr) genes within the 9-exon and other large subfamilies, but it remains unclear how other HsOr subfamilies may contribute to CHC detection.

Twenty-three HsOrs across sixteen subfamilies were screened, and several were found to be broadly tuned and weakly responsive to the HCs tested, except for HsOr152 which showed narrow tuning to a single HC found on the H. saltator cuticle. Lastly, we compiled and analyzed the HC responses from the 70 HsOrs from this and previous studies.

In this project, neighboring tissue of pig organ whole slide images (WSI) are reconstructed without a ground truth based on histological sections at the end of a complex work-up process. Histological tissue slices with artifacts, frayed or disrupted boundaries and sometimes missing pieces complicate the puzzling task. Thus, typical approaches such as direct feature comparison of tissue boundaries or estimating a tiles position based on an overview image or a known structures are not applicable. A new approach is presented using partial image registration where only parts of a fixed and a moving image are aligned for adjacency. In contrast to existing projects aligning subsequent tissue slices of the same block, WSIs from separated blocks will be reassembled for adjacency. The used three stage vision transformer extracts image features on various scales, compares neighboring tiles by shape, color and texture and predicts transformation parameters. Even though the pipeline is capable of handling rigid transformation such as rotation or reflection, only translation is currently supported due to the limited training set. Supervised training of the network can be realized using a puzzle generator creating irregular shaped fragments of masked whole slide images. The factorized trained neural network is embedded into a sophisticated histopathological vision transformer alignment (HiViTAlign) pipeline executing the following steps in roughly 10 seconds per reassembled tissue puzzle: First, extract the specimen and mask the background in each whole slide image. Second, compare tile boundaries using partial image registration. Third, calculate the adjacency by boundary proximity for each image pair. Fourth, determine a minimal spanning tree to optimize adjacency of pairwise registrations and transformations for tissue reconstruction.

Here we compared 10 different measures of FC, including correlations, partial correlations, coherence, mutual information, and partial information decomposition, and one measure of effective connectivity (EC; regression dynamic causal modelling), across two independent datasets comprising a total of 1,797 participants (867 males). Each method was evaluated for its ability to mitigate motion-related confounds in FC/EC estimates and for its utility in predicting 94 behavioural measures, as assessed via cross-validated kernel ridge regression.

Conversely, traditional correlation-based methods showed the highest sensitivity to motion, but offered the strongest behavioral prediction across most domains and datasets. Nonetheless, relative differences in predictive accuracies were small, indicating that the use of different FC or EC metrics in rs-fMRI does not significantly impact BWAS effect sizes.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Fungal spores are a major cause of severe asthmatic disease. However, the precise events that cause individuals to become sensitised to spores are poorly understood. Mgl2+ type 2 conventional dendritic cells (Mgl2+ cDC2s) are critical in coordinating allergic airway inflammation in mice following repeated exposure to inhaled spores. Yet, whether these DCs are directly acquiring spores from the airway, and the downstream mechanism(s) upon fungal uptake causing DCs to trigger allergic inflammation are unknown. Here we find that spores are acquired by lung DCs after inhalation although these events are rare (~ 0.5% of the cDC2 population). Transcriptomics on isolated spore+ Mgl2+ cDC2s, compared to spore- Mgl2+ cDC2s from the same environment, revealed that a major consequence of fungal uptake was a boost in metabolic activity. Single-cell metabolic profiling revealed this increase in Mgl2+ cDC2 metabolism upon spore acquisition was fuelled by a glycolytic shift. To pinpoint if nutrient availability and acquisition is an important determinant of this response, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics revealed that, during fungal allergic inflammation, the local airway nutrient environment is altered. To ascertain which of these could be fuelling DC responses, we identified which substrates that feed into glycolysis were crucial. Of these, we found that glucose availability acts as a key rheostat in shaping cDC2 responses to spores. These data highlight a crucial role for glycolytic metabolism in driving cDC2 responses to spores, which is governed by glucose availability, defining novel targets for future therapeutic development of fungal allergic inflammation.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

P.; Pfeffer, S.; Girardi, E.", "abstract": "In mammalian cells, the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cytoplasm is a danger signal indicative of viral infection. Cells establish and maintain an antiviral state via the production of interferon (IFN) in response to the detection of viral dsRNAs by specialized RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). In addition to viral dsRNA, endogenous (endo) dsRNAs can also be expressed and recognized either causing autoimmune diseases or regulating physiological processes, depending on their abundance, localization and modification profile. Although evidence on the regulatory role of endo-dsRNAs has increasingly been reported, the mechanisms behind their association with host RBPs and their immunogenicity remains largely misunderstood. To identify new endo-dsRNA-associated proteins and regulatory pathways, we induced the accumulation of endo-dsRNAs in wild type (WT) and ADAR1 KO HCT116 cells treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidin (5-AZA) and isolated the endo-dsRNA-associated proteome. Among the interactors, we identified the Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN), a key enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. We demonstrated that FASN associates with endo-dsRNAs already in untreated WT HCT116 cells and that this interaction increases upon 5-AZA treatment and in the absence of ADAR1. Moreover, FASN depletion leads to the accumulation of cytoplasmic endo-dsRNAs in close proximity to mitochondria, induces the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as IFIT1, increases type III IFN secretion and MAVS aggregation. This correlates to a strong reduction of Sindbis virus (SINV) replication in FASN KO HCT116 cells, where ISG expression is significantly induced. This increase in antiviral response is also observed upon poly I:C treatment of FASN KO HCT116 cells. Overall, our data indicate that the accumulation of endo-dsRNAs in FASN-depleted cells induce a stronger innate immune response to exogenous dsRNAs, suggesting a positive feedback loop dependent on FASN expression.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Pollen spectra from buried swidden soils (500 - 1800 cal BP) were compared with coeval peat layers and modern surface soils. Swidden horizons exhibited highly distinctive pollen spectra, characterized by Betula dominance, low conifer pollen, and the presence of cultivation indicators (Cerealia) and post-fire succession taxa (Chamaenerion, Pteridium, Marchantia). The abundance of insect-pollinated Chamaenerion angustifolium - the most prominent indicator - suggests both its wide distribution in swidden landscapes and a possible link to ground-nesting bee activity, which may aid in identifying buried swiddens. In peat records, the onset of slash-and-burn agriculture was marked by microcharcoal, a decline in late-successional trees, a rise in pioneer taxa, and the appearance of agricultural indicators. Betula dominance in both archives reflects secondary stands typical of long-term swidden use. However, indicators of cultivation and succession were much less pronounced in peat. Our results show that paleosol pollen spectra provide reliable, site-specific evidence of swidden agriculture through local indicator taxa and traces of bee activity, though they tend to overrepresent local vegetation. In contrast, peat and lake records offer broader regional perspectives but detect swidden activity only indirectly. These insights provide a methodological basis for localizing ancient agricultural practices in future archeology and palaeoecology-related studies.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The results show that slash-and-burn cultivation creates a unique palynological assemblage in soil, distinguishable from forests, meadows, fallows, and ruderal habitats. This signature was most pronounced in sites from broad-leaved coniferous forest, where cryptogam diversity was highest. Here, we report that pollen spectra from buried swidden soils across the Eastern European forest zone consistently form a distinct and cohesive cluster, lacking modern analogues. These spectra are characterized by high proportions of Betula, Tilia, Epilobium angustifolium, cereal pollen, and a diverse assemblage of spores (Marchantia, Lycopodium, Pteridium), reflecting a mosaic of post-cultivation successional stages. Insect activity, particularly pollen-storing burrows of ground-nesting bees, may enhance the swidden signal through selective accumulation of fireweed entomophilous pollen.

Using current occurrence data and six ecologically relevant climate variables, we find that, as expected, T. elliptica and A. latifolia share highly similar climatic niches with substantial overlap (~84%). Mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean temperature of the driest quarter (MTDQ), and temperature annual range (TAR) emerge as the key environmental variables explaining the distribution of both species, but their relative influence differs. T. elliptica appears to occur across a broader climatic niche that includes wetter areas with cooler dry seasons (lower MTDQ) and lower temperature annual ranges (TAR) relative to A. latifolia. Currently, the area of modelled suitable habitat for both species are vast (A. latifolia: 416,057 km{superscript 2}; T. elliptica: 401,544 km{superscript 2}). However, under future climate scenarios, both species are projected to incur dramatic losses of suitable habitat (A. latifolia: ~63% by 2041-2060 and ~84% by 2081-2100; T. elliptica: ~57.8% by 2041-2060 and ~73% by 2081-2100). By 2100, the Western Ghats are projected to remain as the last key refugia for both species, while vast other regions are likely to become increasingly unsuitable.

The specific genes mediating CUD remain largely unknown. Methods We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using outbred N/NIH Heterogeneous Stock (HS; n = 836, female = 415, male = 421) rats. We examined multiple CUD-related phenotypes that captured acquisition of self-administration, escalation of intake, and compulsive-like responding. Results Consistent with the existing literature, these traits were phenotypically and genetically correlated and exhibited modest heritability (h2 = 0.07 - 0.16). We identified six genome-wide significant associations. One locus on chromosome 19 was associated with the variable time between cocaine infusions (post infusion interval) and contains several carboxylesterase genes that are orthologous to the human CES1 gene; notably, carboxylesterases metabolize cocaine. Three non-synonymous coding variants in the genes Ces1c and Ces1d were in perfect linkage disequilibrium with this locus, suggesting that one or more of them might be the causal SNP. The other 5 loci also contained promising coding and expression variants, including Trak2, a gene previously associated with CUD in human GWAS and Slc10a7, Plcl1, and Satb2 which have been associated with alcohol and tobacco use disorder.

Compared to GelMA, Gel-PEG improved printing fidelity and resolution, superior mechanical properties, and reduced swelling. We fabricated disc-like constructs and channel geometries, including straight channels and angular designs, and cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and 143b human osteosarcoma cells, a highly metastatic cell line, for up to 14 days. Using label-free holographic microscopy, we visualized cellular protrusions, important for adhesion and mechanosensing, in real-time and without staining, an advantage for long-term, live-cell analysis in 3D constructs. HUVECs adhered well, expressed CD31, and showed preferential spreading in channels with specific geometrical angles, indicating geometry-sensitive behavior. This is physiologically relevant, as it reflects the native mechanosensitive and alignment behavior of endothelial cells during vascular formation. In contrast, osteosarcoma cells spread uniformly throughout the constructs, formed dense, geometry-independent agglomerates, and exhibited enhanced growth and spreading within the Gel-PEG matrix compared to GelMA. This behavior is consistent with the aggressive and geometry-insensitive nature of metastatic tumor cells.

Accurate measurement of striking forces is essential for evaluation. However, direct measurement of athletes' striking forces presents significant practical and safety challenges, necessitating the development of indirect estimation approaches. Method: A controllable pendulum-based impact testing apparatus was developed to evaluate force attenuation characteristics of Taekwondo body protectors. The system delivered repeatable impacts across varying magnitudes and contact durations to a mannequin equipped with a protector. Simultaneous measurements of input and transmitted forces through the protector enabled direct quantification of attenuation ratios under controlled conditions. To demonstrate practical application, five Taekwondo athletes performed standardized kicks on the instrumented protector setup, allowing estimation of their actual striking forces using the derived attenuation factor. Results: Force attenuation ratios demonstrated high consistency across impact magnitudes ranging from 300 to 5800 Newtons, with impact duration variations showing minimal influence on attenuation performance. Linear attenuation relationships were established between input and transmitted forces (R2 [&ge;] 0.987), enabling derivation of a predictive attenuation factor. Validation testing with the pendulum system showed that the estimated input force trajectories achieved an nRMSE of 3.5%. Averaged across the entire force range, the MAPE was 4.7% for maximum force, 1.4% for impact duration, and 3.5% for impulse. Applying the attenuation factor to standardized kicks performed by five Taekwondo athletes yielded estimated maximum striking forces ranging from approximately 1300 to 1800 Newtons, demonstrating the method's capability to quantify actual forces that would otherwise be difficult to measure directly.

Previous work, most notably the 4DHiC chromosome modeling framework, has shown that physical multi-dimensional modeling approaches rooted in polymer physics and molecular dynamics can resolve these structures at biologically meaningful resolutions by integrating temporal Hi-C data with physical constraints to uncover dynamic chromosome reorganization. Thus, molecular dynamics simulations, constrained by Hi-C contact matrices, can resolve fine-scale structural changes and reveal functionally significant transitions in chromatin conformation.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Stochastic trace estimation offers a practical solution by using randomized matrix-vector products to obtain accurate, unbiased estimates without constructing the full matrix in memory. Here, we present traceax, a Python framework for scalable trace estimation that leverages efficient linear operator representations of matrices while supporting automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration. traceax supports state-of-the-art trace estimators and through simulations we recapitulate results demonstrating their high accuracy while significantly reducing runtime and memory usage when compared with direct trace computation. As a proof of concept, we implemented a stochastic heritability estimator using traceax requiring only several lines of code. Overall, traceax provides a versatile tool for stochastic trace estimation that can be easily integrated into existing inferential pipelines. traceax is freely available at: https://github.com/mancusolab/traceax", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Across 50 synthetic datasets, DupCaller identified 1.25-fold more single-base substitutions (SBSs) and 1.41-fold more indels than a state-of-the-art method, while exhibiting equal or better precision. In three duplex-sequenced cell lines treated with aristolochic acid, it recovered expected mutational signatures while detecting 3.5-fold more SBSs and 2.8-fold more indels. In 93 tissue samples-including neurons, cord blood, sperm, saliva, and blood-DupCaller showed consistent gains, detecting 1.21- to 2.7-fold more mutations. Sensitivity scaled with sample duplication rate, yielding approximately 1.5-fold more mutations under optimal conditions and over 3-fold more in low-duplication samples where other tools falter.

These arthropods are now found even in temperate climates, including Europe, where outbreaks have already occurred. A better understanding of the virus life cycle is essential, as it may enable the development of specific treatments or therapies which are currently lacking. However, recent breakthroughs concerning the biologically relevant viral capsid (C) protein structure and function are encouraging. It is now clear the C protein binds both to host lipid droplets and to the viral genome, a set of interactions that is crucial for viral encapsidation and replication. Previously, we studied DENV C protein interaction with lipid droplets, at the molecular level. Here, we examine how the association of DENV C protein with the viral genome occurs. Using DENV C protein and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequences analogous to previously identified important regions of the viral genome, we biophysically characterize their interactions. A decrease in fluorescence intensity and lifetime, an increase in both anisotropy and hydrodynamic diameter, as well as changes in the protein's secondary structure, were observed upon binding to ssDNA. These changes are consistent with molecular condensation and raise the possibility of liquid-liquid phase separation involvement in DENV C-nucleic acid complex formation. These findings may be useful for the development of future therapeutic strategies based on nucleic acids, not only for DENV but also for other related viruses.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Previously, we reported increased expression of Cys-526-nitrosylated COX-2 (SNO-COX-2), but not non-nitrosylated COX-2, with progression of early-stage human breast cancer to invasive ductal carcinoma. Here, we used a 3D culture model of early-stage human breast cancer (MCF10DCIS cells) to investigate the relationship between SNO-COX-2 expression and mesenchymal/invasive tumor cell morphology. We find that SNO-COX-2, but not non-nitrosylated COX-2, closely associated with mesenchymal phenotypes induced by fibrillar type I collagen. Interestingly, invasive phenotypes did not associate with induction of the classic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers SNAIL, CDH2 (N-cadherin), and VIM (vimentin). By contrast TGF{beta}-1 strongly induced EMT-related transcripts, but not SNO-COX-2 protein expression or mesenchymal phenotypes. These observations suggest that in MCF10DCIS cells, SNO-COX-2 associates with mesenchymal phenotypes more strongly than non-nitrosylated COX-2 protein, or expression of classic EMT transcripts. In a mouse model with breast tumor heterogeneity, mesenchymal tumor regions also have increased SNO-COX-2 expression. Testing 300 distinct tumor microenvironment conditions, we find SNO-COX-2 protein expression is driven by inflammation, wound resolution, and cancer-associated factors, especially TNC, SPP1, decorin, fibrillar type I and III collagens, INF-{gamma}, and IL-4/13, with evidence for specific extracellular matrix-ligand interactions driving both high and low SNO-COX-2 expression.

Additionally, this study aimed to investigate the association between changes in endothelial function and the incidence of cardiovascular rehospitalizations or deaths. Methods This prospective longitudinal study included 120 patients with HFrEF. Hemodynamic parameters were assessed using impedance cardiography. Endothelial function was evaluated using digital thermal monitoring to calculate the Endothelial Quality Index (EQI) at baseline and after 3 months. Patients were followed for 12 months. Results The mean age was 61.9 {+/-} 10.2 years, with a sex ratio of 5:1. 42.5% of patients tend to experience endothelial dysfunction at baseline. After 3 months of optimized therapy, EQI improved significantly (p<0.001), correlating with improved echography and hemodynamic parameters. Over 12 months, there were 5 deaths (4.16%) and 44 heart failure rehospitalizations (36.6%), predominantly among those with severe endothelial dysfunction (p=0.008).

Recent studies have reported the role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in AD pathogenesis, leading to increased interest in microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation. Building on these findings, recent advances in computational modeling have introduced machine learning and deep learning-based approaches to capture the nonlinear relationships between gut microbiota and diseases. However, these models focus on diseases other than AD and often fail to capture complex microbial interactions or incorporate microbial genomic information, thereby offering limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose ATOMIC, an interpretable graph attention network-based model that incorporates microbial co-expression networks to predict AD. Microbial co-expression networks incorporate microbial genomic information as node features, thereby enhancing their ability to capture functionally relevant microbial patterns. To train and test our model, we collected and processed 99 gut microbiome samples from adult patients with AD and healthy controls at Kangwon National University Hospital (KNUH). As a result, ATOMIC achieved an AUROC of 0.810 and an AUPRC of 0.927 on the KNUH dataset. Furthermore, ATOMIC identified microbes potentially associated with AD prediction and proposed candidate microbial biomarkers that may inform future therapeutic strategies.

Recent studies demonstrate that the olfactory bulb (OB) encodes such temporal features present in natural odor stimuli. However, whether this temporal information is encoded in the piriform cortex (PCx), the primary cortical target of OB projections, remains unknown. Here, we developed a biophysically relevant PCx network model and simulated it using previously recorded in vivo activities of mitral and tufted cells from OB in response to 2Hz and 20Hz odor frequencies for three odor mixtures. Analysis of the pyramidal cells' (PYRs) activity during the initial 500ms of odor stimulation revealed that 4.4-11.8% of cells exhibited significantly different average firing rates for the two different frequencies. Furthermore, 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) models trained and tested on PYRs' activities achieved discrimination accuracies of 73-95%. However, cells showing significant frequency discrimination contributed similarly to CNN performance as the non-discriminating cells. Using virtual synaptic knockout models, we found that eliminating either feedback or feedforward inhibition onto PYRs improved CNN decoding accuracy across all odor conditions. Conversely, eliminating recurrent excitation among pyramidal neurons or eliminating recurrent inhibition among both interneuron types simultaneously degraded CNN accuracy. Removing recurrent connections within individual interneuron populations had minimal effects on the performance. Our PCx model demonstrates that it can discriminate between 2Hz and 20Hz odor stimuli, with a bidirectional capability of performance modulation by specific circuit motifs.

Deviations from the physiological range often signal underlying pathology. Despite its diagnostic importance, there is currently no standardized, open-source tool for g-ratio analysis from post-segmented electron microscopy images. To address this gap, we developed MyeliMetric, a Python-based, user-friendly toolbox that streamlines g-ratio data preprocessing and integrates biologically informed validation, requiring minimal statistical expertise to operate without introducing common analytical errors. It is built on the principle that g-ratios exhibit relative consistency across varying axon diameters in healthy conditions. To rigorously assess this relationship, MyeliMetric implements a binning strategy that groups axons into biologically relevant diameter cohorts, enabling the detection of size-dependent deviations in g-ratio distributions. This approach addresses common limitations in conventional analyses, including insufficient sampling, pseudo-replication, and artifacts such as misleading regression slopes. Validation using both synthetic and published datasets from rodent models of demyelination demonstrated the tool's accuracy, reproducibility, and biological relevance.

Here, we improved functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging to examine how cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes relate to behavioral parameters in rats during free exploration. High-resolution imaging of hippocampal-parahippocampal regions during open-field exploration reveals strong correlations between CBV dynamics and animal speed, with distinct regional activation patterns and temporal delays. Lagged general linear modeling uncovers information flow from the thalamus to parahippocampal regions, including the medial entorhinal cortex, and to hippocampal subfields (dentate gyrus, CA1 - CA3), consistent with a hierarchical processing framework. The analysis also links CBV with angular head speed and the dorsal thalamus. Decoding analyses show that CBV signals not only encode speed precisely but also capture spatial features like proximity to walls and corners, even when univariate analyses do not. This decoding remains robust across animals, underscoring the universality of speed encoding in vascular dynamics. We also identify slow CBV oscillations in the hippocampus aligned with minute-scale speed fluctuations, suggesting a neurovascular signature of exploratory behavior. These findings reveal a hemodynamic signature of speed representation in the navigation system, arising from energy demands in a continuous attractor network model for path integration, where population activity and synaptic currents increase quadratically with animal speed as both peak firing rates and neuronal recruitment scale linearly with animal speed. Moreover, they highlight functional ultrasound imaging as a powerful approach for probing the hemodynamic basis of navigation.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

To address this, we paired a soft tone (65 dB) with one of two high-contrast circular gratings (15 or 75 degrees; CS+; counterbalanced), while two intermediate orientations (35, 55 degrees) were never paired with the neutral tone, serving as generalization stimuli (GS). A sample of 22 participants viewed each grating for 3000 ms, with the tone presented during the last 1000 ms of each grating presentation. Gratings were flickered (turned on and off) at a temporal rate of 15 Hz, to evoked steady-state Visual Evoked Potentials (ssVEPs), a metric of visuocortical engagement. Time-frequency decomposition via Morlet wavelets quantified changes in the amplitude of alpha-band (8-13 Hz) oscillations - an additional electrophysiological index that has been shown to be sensitive to aversive conditioning. Contrary to findings observed during aversive conditioning, alpha amplitude increased, rather than decreased, during CS+ trials relative to GSs. Likewise, ssVEP amplitude was higher for GSs than for the CS+, which again is the opposite of what is found during aversive conditioning. These findings suggest that a CS paired with non-aversive outcomes engages mechanisms consistent with working memory, anticipation, or imagery processes, reflected in heightened alpha amplitude and attenuated ssVEP, rather than the defensive potentiation observed during aversive conditioning.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The present study examined the relationship between social anxiety and generalization of visuocortical and pupil dilation responses to a series of facial morphs, one of which was always paired with a noxious sound. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs; N = 65) increasingly fit a model of generalization, and pupil dilation responses (N = 62) also decreasingly discriminated the CS+ as a function of social anxiety.

The finding of widened visuocortical tuning in SAD implicates a role of the visual system in driving attentional biases in anxiety disorders, including increased visual processing of safety signals similar to threat cues.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Using gross dissection, light microscopy, and ultrastructural methods on fresh postmortem and cadaveric fetal to adult age CNS specimens (N=61), we demonstrate the presence of a fibro-cellular intermediate leptomeningeal layer (ILL) in the human CNS along the entire neural axis, from the cortex to the caudal end of the spinal cord. ILL divides the subarachnoid space (SAS) into two distinct structural compartments, traversed by vessels and nerves. The ILL shows unique structural features, such as dips into the sulci and fissures of the brain as a double-fold membrane carrying the vessels, bears intra-layer trabeculae, and creates the perivascular sheath. In the spinal cord, ILL shows the presence of distinct meningothelial cells with macrophage-like properties. Moreover, throughout the neural axis, it appears to be a non-sieved barrier, characterized by the presence of tight and adherens junctions.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Although the World Health Organization has set a safety limit of 10 g/L for arsenic in drinking water, an estimated 200 million people worldwide are still exposed to arsenic concentrations above this threshold. Eliciting a broad range of adverse health effects, arsenic is a known carcinogen classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and causes increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, highlighting its role as an immunotoxicant. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the effects of arsenic on the innate immune system, namely macrophages, using in vitro exposure models. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were cultured from adult male and female C57/BL6 mice. These naive macrophages (\"M0\" BMDMs) were exposed in vitro to a non-cytotoxic dose of iAs (0.1 M sodium (meta)arsenite) during the 7-day period of macrophage differentiation and stimulated for 24 hrs with LPS and IFN{gamma} (to induce \"M1\" pro-inflammatory activation) or IL-4 and IL-13 (to induce \"M2\" anti-inflammatory activation). In a parallel chronic exposure model, RAW 264.7 (RAW) macrophages were cultured in vitro with iAs for 70 days. Culture supernatant analysis for nitric oxide and cytokine secretion revealed sex-dependent differences in immune response between exposure models, as well as between iAs-exposed and nonexposed macrophages, with and without stimulation. Additionally, iAs-exposed macrophages exhibited increased lipid droplet formation and altered lipidomic and metabolomic profiles, as determined by LC/MS. Flow cytometric analysis further revealed changes in macrophage polarization markers in a sex- and stimulation-dependent manner, with M2-related markers being upregulated in iAs-exposed conditions. Finally, to assess the effects of iAs on macrophages in the context of cancer, we demonstrated that iAs-exposed macrophages displayed increased migration toward cancer cell-conditioned media and promoted cancer cell proliferation. These results suggest that dysregulated macrophage polarization due to iAs exposure could impact susceptibility to diseases. This research contributes to our understanding of the full spectrum of adverse health effects of iAs exposure and may aid in the development of therapeutics for iAs-induced diseases, including cancer.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

At the global scale, the microbial fixation of N2, or diazotrophy, represents the primary source of fixed nitrogen in pelagic marine ecosystems, playing a key role in supporting primary production and driving the export of organic matter to the deep ocean. However, given the high energetic cost of N2 fixation, the active release of fixed nitrogen by diazotrophs appears counterintuitive, suggesting the existence of alternative, passive release pathways, that remain understudied to date. Here, we show that the marine Non Cyanobacterial Diazotroph Vibrio diazotrophicus is endowed with a prophage belonging to the Myoviridae family, whose expression is induced under anoxic and biofilm-forming conditions. We demonstrate that this prophage can spontaneously excise from the genome of its host and that it forms intact and infective phage particles. Moreover, phage-mediated host cell lysis leads to increased biofilm production as compared to a prophage-free derivative mutant, and to increased release of Dissolved Organic Carbon and of ammonium. Altogether, we provide evidences that viruses may play a previously unrecognized role in oceanic ecosystem dynamics by structuring micro-habitats suitable for diazotrophy and by contributing to the recycling of (in-)organic matter.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Particularly in low-resource countries, the mortality rate of CM can reach 81% and accounts for 19% of HIV/AIDS-related deaths each year. In immunocompromised individuals, once inhaled, C. neoformans escapes from the lungs and disseminates with special predilection for the central nervous system (CNS). Once in the brain, C. neoformans interacts with microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages of the CNS. Previous studies indirectly showed that microglia are ineffective at controlling this fungal infection. The mechanisms underlying this fungal survival and proliferation within the CNS, however, remain unclear. In this study, we use and validate the C20 immortalized human microglia cell line to study cryptococcal-microglia interactions. We show that microglia have limited phagocytic activity that is specific to C. neoformans and partly dependent on cryptococcal antiphagocytic proteins that alter cell size and cell wall structure. We also show human microglia respond to cryptococcal strains differently than peripheral macrophages. Further, we show that human microglia are ineffective at killing phagocytosed C. neoformans, and that this could be due to the ability of this yeast to disrupt phagosome maturation and induce phagosome membrane damage in these cells. These findings provide us with fundamental knowledge regarding cryptococcal pathogenesis in the CNS, specifically insight into how C. neoformans is recognized by microglia under different conditions and demonstrate the usefulness of C20 cells to further study how this yeast survives and replicates within the CNS environment.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Deletion of acrAB2nodT in the {Delta}tipR background restored Cu resistance to wild-type levels, confirming the role of pump overexpression in metal sensitivity. Morphological and microscopy analyses revealed that pump overexpression leads to cell envelope defects and compromised fitness. To disentangle the effects of pump abundance from efflux activity, we engineered an AcrB2 transport-impaired mutant. This variant also rescued Cu resistance, demonstrating that high expression and active transport contribute to the observed toxicity. Notably, this sensitivity was not limited to Cu; the {Delta}tipR mutant also exhibited increased susceptibility to other transition metals, including zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni) and cadmium (Cd), suggesting a broader vulnerability linked to metal stress. Mechanistically, pump overexpression depleted the proton motive force, reduced ATP levels, and impaired motility, all of which are essential for Cu stress adaptation.

This has driven efforts to identify modulators of ATF6 signalling. Here, an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen performed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells revealed that proteolytic processing of the ATF6 precursor to its active form was impaired in CHO cells lacking the ER-resident solute carrier SLC33A1, a transporter involved in acetyl-CoA import, sialylation and N{varepsilon}-lysine protein acetylation. Cells lacking SLC33A1 constitutively trafficked the ATF6 precursor to the Golgi, but exhibit impaired subsequent Golgi processing, correlating with altered ATF6 Golgi glycosylation. SLC33A1 deficiency also deregulated activation of the IRE1 branch of the UPR, pointing to a selective loss of ATF6-mediated negative feedback in the UPR. Notably, Slc33a1-deleted cells accumulated higher levels of unmodified sialylated N-glycans, precursors to acetylated glycans, likely reflecting impaired glycan processing. By contrast, deletion of ER-localised acetyltransferases NAT8 and NAT8B (that catalyse N{varepsilon}-lysine protein acetylation in the secretory pathway) did not replicate the ATF6 processing defects observed in Slc33a1-deficient cells.

Lymphatic selective depletion of 15LO (Prox1cre; Alox15fl/fl mice) increased both systemic and resident eosinophil (EOS) accumulation in lesions, but had no effect on other immune cell populations. Mechanistically, in vitro depletion of 15LO in lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) significantly decreased EOS adhesion. In contrast, 15LO LEC depletion improved transendothelial migration.

Inherited aneuploidies typically arise from meiotic chromosome segregation errors and are strongly affected by maternal age. Cohesin, a protein complex that mediates cohesion between sister chromatids, becomes depleted from oocyte chromosomes with age in mice, potentially contributing to the high rate of aneuploidy in older mouse oocytes. However, it remains unclear at which stage of oogenesis ageing affects chromatid cohesion in mice and whether ageing similarly affects cohesin in human oocytes. Here we use fluorescence in situ hybridisation to assess at which stages of oogenesis ageing alters chromatid separation in mice and in humans. We show that chromatid separation increases with age while oocytes remain dormant in primordial follicles in both mice and humans and that this effect of age on chromatid separation is detectable in fertile women of child-bearing age. Furthermore, we show that this age-dependent increase in chromatid separation is accompanied by age-dependent depletion of the acetylated SMC3-marked cohesive subpopulation of cohesin from oocytes at the dormant primordial follicle stage in both mice and humans. These data suggest that ageing impacts on oocyte chromosomes while they remain dormant in primordial follicles, and that this aspect of oocyte chromosome ageing is shared in both mice and humans. Improving our understanding of these pathways may allow strategies to slow or prevent this aspect of oocyte ageing to be developed.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Here we uncovered a new function of NHR-49 in reproduction - controlling oocyte activation and ovulation. Loss of NHR-49 causes inappropriate oocyte activation and laying of unfertilized oocytes in the absence of sperm, resulting in rapid loss of yolk and stored fat, and drastically shortening of lifespan. We further demonstrated that prevention of yolk transfer into the oocytes largely restore fat storage and partially rescue lifespan in the nhr-49 mutants. Additionally, NHR-49 appears to couple germline proliferation to nutritional status, as evidenced by its requirement for starvation-induced reduction in germline proliferation. Mechanistically, we showed that NHR-49 primarily acts in somatic cells, rather than the germline itself, to regulate oocyte activation and ovulation. We further demonstrated that NHR-49 binds to the promoter of GSA-1 and may stimulate its expression. GSA-1 encodes a G-protein coupled receptor known to act in the gonadal sheath cells to couple sperm sensing and oocyte activation. Our findings therefore suggest a model whereby NHR-49 regulates the expression of GSA-1, which in turn regulates oocyte activation in response to sperm signal.

J.; Oyler, H.; Levine, J. M.; Kraft, N. J.

In principle, the degree of spatial clustering could alter the concentration of higher-order interactions, which occur when one (or more) species modifies competition between two others. When species are well mixed, heterospecific neighbors have ample opportunity to modify a competitor's interactions with other species. In contrast, species clustering can reduce the concentration of interspecific higher-order interactions. In a field experiment with annual grassland plants in California, we manipulated the spatial arrangement -- but not the number or identity -- of two competitors and measured how they jointly affected a focal individual. We found that focal plants produced more seeds when their competitors were clustered than when they were mixed. These results suggest that interspecific higher-order interactions generally had a stronger competitive (or weaker facilitative) effect than intraspecific ones. However, the effect of clustering varied across species. Larger differences in focal fecundity were correlated with competitors that had greater differences in size and/or functional traits between the spatial arrangements. Additionally, a competitive hierarchy among our study species predicted the effects of clustered versus mixed competitors on focal seed production. Altogether, our work suggests that the spatial arrangement of competitors changes the realized strength of competition in diverse plant communities by modifying the concentration of higher-order interactions. Given the extensive variation in spatial aggregation in plant communities, this mechanism is likely to be a powerful but underappreciated force shaping competition in nature.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Our models revealed an 18.5% net decrease in pollinator habitat suitability citywide, with marked variation across boroughs, including localized increases in Manhattan and the Bronx. Climatic variables, especially temperature, solar radiation, and vapor pressure deficit, emerged as the strongest predictors of habitat suitability, while land cover changes had more localized effects. Among land cover types, urban forest was the only class to show increased suitability, suggesting that greening initiatives may buffer some climate-driven declines.

Methods Snails were collected from various sites across Gabon and were morphologically identified to species or genus level. Snail species were randomly selected, dissected and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS and molecular analysis. Parasites were detected by cercarial emission, followed by qPCR analysis and sequencing. Results A total of 3,722 snails were collected and morphologically identified as Bulinus truncatus (n=1845), Bulinus forskalii (n=381), Gyraulus costulatus (n=680), Bellamya sp. (n=67) and Melania sp. (n=749). Of the 3,722 snails collected, 21.2% (n = 791) were selected for further analysis, including Bu. truncatus (n = 301), Bu. forskalii (n = 158), and Gy. costulatus (n=147). A subset of 65 snails was subjected to molecular identification to confirm morphological classification, using COI, ITS, and 18S gene. BLAST analysis of the resulting sequences showed 97-100% identity with reference sequences of Bu. truncatus, Bu. forskalii, and Gy. costulatus available in GenBank. Analysis of the MS spectra from the 791 snails revealed that 78.2% (n = 618) were of high quality, with signal intensities exceeding 3,000 arbitrary units (a.u.). The MALDI-TOF MS reference database was subsequently updated with 12 high-quality spectra, comprising four representative spectra for each snail species. A blind test of 606 remaining spectra against the database. A blind test of the remaining 606 spectra, using the updated MALDI-TOF MS reference database, demonstrated reliable identification of 100% (Bulinus forskalii, 147/147; Gyraulus costulatus, 158/158) and 96% (Bulinus truncatus, 289/301) of the specimens. These results were consistent with morphological identification, with log score values (LSVs) ranging from 1.7 to 2.8. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that Bulinus species clustered according to their geographical origin. Overall, 17,66% of the snails analysed were found to be positive for Schistosoma sp. Further analysis, including qPCR and sequencing, revealed that the snails were infected with Schistosoma haematobium. Conclusion We report the first data on the identification of snails by MALDI-TOF MS in Gabon and show that Bu. truncatus and Bu. forskalii are potential intermediate hosts of S. haematobium. We also show a heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of snails in south-eastern Gabon.

Ground-dwelling generalist predators such as carabids (Carabidae) and spiders (Araneae) are key contributors to natural pest control, yet their populations are threatened by modern farming practices. Organic mulching - a practice that increases within-crop habitat diversity - has been proposed as a means to support beneficial arthropod communities while also delivering agronomic benefits. This study investigated the effects of different organic mulches (triticale/vetch, straw, grass silage) on carabid and spider communities in three large-scale, replicated field trials in potato fields in central Germany. Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps during and after the growing season, with additional traps used to assess potential sampling biases related to mulch presence. Community composition, species-specific responses, and potential carry-over effects into the following year were analysed using a combination of generalised linear mixed models, diversity indices, ordination methods, and indicator species analysis. Across the trials, 12,076 adult carabids (42 taxa) and 2,399 spiders (38 taxa) were collected, enabling robust analysis of treatment effects on community composition and species-specific responses. The results showed that organic mulching, particularly with triticale/vetch, significantly increased the abundance of several carabid (Bembidion lampros, B. quadrimaculatum, Poecilus cupreus) and Linyphiidae spider (Erigone atra, E. dentipalpis, Agyneta rurestris) species, and altered overall community composition. Species richness tended to be higher in mulched plots, though effects on diversity indices were less consistent. However, positive impacts on predator populations were largely restricted to the potato growing season, with no evidence of persistent carry-over effects into the subsequent year.

X.; Torgasheva, A.; Whibley, A.; Suh, A.", "abstract": "Bird genomes are among the most stable in terms of synteny and gene content across vertebrates. However, germline-restricted chromosomes (GRCs) represent a striking exception where programmed DNA elimination confines large-scale genomic changes to the germline. GRCs are known to occur in songbirds (oscines), but have been studied only in a few species of Passerides such as the zebra finch, the key model for passerine genomics. Their presence and evolutionary dynamics in most major passerine lineages remain largely unexplored, with suboscines entirely unexamined by cytogenetic or genomic methods. Here, we present the most comprehensive comparative analysis of GRCs to date, spanning 44 million years of passerine evolution. By generating the first germline reference genomes of an oscine and a suboscine, 22 novel germline draft genomes spanning nearly all major passerine lineages and a germline draft genome of a parrot outgroup, we show that the GRC is likely present in 6,700 passerine species. Our results reveal that the GRC evolves rapidly and distinctly from the standard A chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes), yet retains functionally important, selectively maintained genes. We observed gene and repeat turnover occuring orders of magnitude faster than on the A chromosomes. Some GRC genes, such as cpeb1 and pim1, are widespread from an ancient duplication. In contrast, other GRC genes, like mfsd2b and bmp15, have been independently duplicated onto the GRC multiple times, suggesting adaptive constraints. The discovery of zglp1 on the zebra finch GRC, initially copied from chromosome 30 and subsequently lost from it, indicates functional replacement, where the GRC permits gene loss from the standard genome. As the GRC harbors the only zglp1 copy in most of the ~4000 Passerides species, GRC loss would compromise essential germline functions. Our findings establish the GRC as a genomic innovator driving rapid germline evolution. This fact highlights its evolutionary significance for passerine diversification and suggests that programmed DNA elimination may be an overlooked yet phylogenetically widespread mechanism in many understudied animal lineages.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

To elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, single-nuclei RNA sequencing was performed on gonadal tissue from adult captive-bred and wild-bred males. The analysis yielded a high-quality dataset comprising ~80.000 cells, which were grouped into eleven distinct clusters representing all major germline and somatic cell types, including spermatogonial stem cells, differentiating spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, immune cells, and peritubular myoid cells. It is noteworthy that captive-bred males exhibited a marked overrepresentation of proliferative spermatogonia and a significant reduction in mature spermatids, suggesting a disruption in the progression of spermatogenesis. Differential expression and functional enrichment analyses revealed that spermatogonial cells in captive-bred males displayed heightened translational activity alongside downregulation of pathways related to cell-cell communication and interaction. Focused cell-cell communication analyses further indicated defective Sertoli-spermatogonia interactions as a key factor contributing to oligospermia and infertility of captive-bred males. This study provides the first single-nuclei transcriptomic atlas of the Senegalese sole male gonad, offering valuable insights into the molecular basis of reproductive failure in captivity related to gonadal development.

Due to concerns over global and local declines, improving our understanding of these ecologically and commercially important species is crucial for determining their capacity to respond and adapt to environmental challenges. The European orchard bee (Osmia cornuta) is a solitary bee of increasing agricultural importance due to its role in the pollination of fruit crops, yet lacks genomic resources. Using cost-effective Nanopore-only long-read sequencing, we report the first genome assembly for O. cornuta, spanning 647.56Mb across 727 contigs (N50=3.94Mb) at a high level of completeness (99.88% BUSCO complete). In line with the expected number of chromosomes in this species, 16 major scaffolds were assembled to chromosome-level. Also, we provisionally investigated the epigenomic architecture of O. cornuta, finding low numbers of CG dinucleotides that were either 5'-methylated or 5'-hydroxymethylated, providing additional evidence for the limited role methylation plays in gene regulation in Hymenopterans. To generate improved gene annotations, we combined transcriptomic- and orthology-based approaches, leading to the prediction of 12,144 genes and 25,964 proteins, showing exceptionally high BUSCO completeness (99.64%). Lastly, through whole-genome resequencing of a representative dataset, we provisionally find patterns of reduced nucleotide diversity and lower recombination rates within O. cornuta compared to other bee species.

While well-studied in vertebrates, little is known about how wild insects adjust their behaviour to repeated stressors in natural settings. This study tested whether wild field crickets (Gryllus campestris) habituate or sensitise to repeated simulated predator attacks, and whether these effects vary with threat intensity. Crickets showed limited evidence of habituation. Emergence time increased slightly over repeated exposures, consistent with modest sensitisation, while post-emergence distance also increased, suggesting a modest habituation effect. Escape speed remained stable. Our results suggest trait-specific behavioural plasticity, as only some response measures changed across repeated exposures while others remained stable. Crickets ranged further from the burrow in response to the stronger stimulus, suggesting greater comfort or reduced perceived risk, though emergence latency and escape speed were unaffected by stimulus intensity. Contrary to our predictions, individual crickets did not respond consistently across the two stimulus types. While some increased their emergence time or post-emergence distance more under one stimulus than the other, others showed little or no change. These patterns suggest that only certain behaviours were flexible, and that individuals varied in how strongly they adjusted these behaviours. Escape speed, by contrast, remained stable. Together, these results indicate limited habituation, trait-specific flexibility, and substantial individual variation in how crickets respond to repeated disturbance, highlighting the diverse strategies animals may use to manage risk in unpredictable environments.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Sensory augmentation of vestibular information, via other senses, could improve these functions. Here, we tested whether synthetic auditory signals carrying self-motion information can be integrated with vestibular cues. Twenty healthy participants experienced self-motion stimuli in a 3D motion simulator, comprising vestibular (inertial motion), and/or synthetic auditory \"motion\" cues. The auditory cues, presented via stereo headphones, comprised a series of beeps, with motion speed encoded by beep rate, and heading direction (in the horizontal plane) encoded by simulating the sound to emanate from that direction. In each trial, participants experienced a single-interval self-motion stimulus (vestibular, auditory or combined), and their task was to discriminate its heading direction (two-alternative forced-choice, right/left of straight ahead). A slight heading conflict (Delta = +/-6 degrees) was introduced in the combined-cue condition to measure empirical cue weights. Combined auditory-vestibular thresholds were significantly lower (improved) compared to vestibular alone (p < 0.001). But integration was suboptimal - vestibular cues were overweighted, and combined-cue thresholds were larger than predicted by Bayesian-optimal weighting. Interestingly, combined-cue thresholds were better predicted by the empirically observed weights. Thus, humans can integrate synthetic auditory cues with natural vestibular cues to improve self-motion perception. However, synthetic cues are underweighted. This suggests that weighting is determined not only by cue reliability but also by perceived relevance, with (unnatural) synthetic cues potentially considered less relevant to the task. Training might be required to achieve reliability-based integration of synthetic and natural cues.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Yet, the interactions between hydrophobic substrates and the highly dynamic hydrophobic surfaces of these catalytic motifs are still poorly understood, making control of selectivity by rational design exceedingly difficult. Here, we investigate the evolutionary emergence of enantioselectivity in borneol dehydrogenases (BDHs), aiming to elucidate whether the natural evolution of enantioselectivity was achieved by modification of either the active-site hydrophobic pocket itself or by indirect effects caused by peripheral mutations. BDHs are characterized by a highly hydrophobic active site and have either very high or very low enantioselectivity in the oxidation of the monoterpenol 1-borneol. Ancestral sequence reconstruction of a set of plant borneol dehydrogenases, including selective and unselective enzymes, identified a putative common ancestor N6 with low enantioselectivity (E=10). The transition from the oldest unselective ancestor N30 to the youngest selective ancestor N32 involved only 19 amino acid substitutions, 18 being allocated in the periphery and only one (I111L) in the active site of the enzyme. Crystal structures of two ancestral dehydrogenases revealed very high structural similarity among themselves and the extant, highly selective enzymes from sage and rosemary. Probing the impact of these mutations by site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the substitution I111L in the hydrophobic pocket increased the selectivity of the oldest unselective ancestor N30 by two-fold. The back-mutation L111I decreased the selectivity of the youngest selective ancestor N32 accordingly. Three additional peripheral mutations then made ancestor N30 L111I/V136L/G169A/V183I truly specific, showing that a combination of active site and peripheral mutations accounts for the high enantioselectivity of the extant dehydrogenases. Molecular simulations with funnel-metadynamics showed a correlation between the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the active site with selectivity, providing a possible explanation for the molecular basis of this striking selectivity. We believe that the reconstitution of a plausible natural evolutionary pathway for the formation of stereoselectivity in biosynthetic enzymes will provide guidance for future protein engineering endeavors.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

However, optimization of microfluidics-integrated biosensor systems and replicability challenges present roadblocks in validation and commercialization. Understanding factors contributing to yield and replicability in biosensor performance is key to the development of biosensor optimization frameworks and technology translation beyond the research setting. Hence, for the first time, we present a detailed analysis of factors affecting performance, assay yield, and intra- and inter-assay replicability in microfluidics-integrated silicon photonic (SiP) evanescent-field microring resonator biosensors. Strategies for mitigating bubbles--a major operational hurdle and contributor to instability and variability in microfluidics-integrated biosensors--are analyzed to improve assay yield. Effective bubble mitigation is demonstrated by combining microfluidic device degassing, plasma treatment, and microchannel pre-wetting with surfactant solution. Both intrinsic and analyte-detection performance metrics and their replicability are quantified for the first time for sub-wavelength grating-based SiP biosensors, highlighting a path to further optimization. Lastly, the effects of sensor functionalization on analyte detection performance and replicability are evaluated. We compare polydopamine- vs. Protein A-mediated bioreceptor immobilization chemistries and spotting- vs. flow-mediated bioreceptor patterning approaches. We find that simple polydopamine-mediated, spotting-based functionalization improves spike protein (1 g/mL) detection signal by 8.2x and 5.8x compared to polydopamine/flow and Protein A/flow approaches, respectively, and yields an inter-assay coefficient of variability below the standard 20% threshold for immunoassay validation.

Hydrolytic plastic-degrading enzymes (PDEs) offer a promising solution, yet their functional classification remains limited by insufficient annotations and enzymatic diversity. In this study, we present an explainable deep learning framework, PEPIC, to classify nine types of PDEs directly from protein sequences. Using a curated dataset of experimentally validated enzymes and an expanded homologous dataset, we built an explainable deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (PEPIC) for plastic-degrading enzyme prediction. We benchmarked the performance of PEPIC against state-of-the-art approaches. First, PEPIC demonstrated statistically significant improvements in predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Second, PEPIC calculates contribution scores for each amino acid in the protein sequence, indicating their influence on the predictions. The model interpretation revealed that regions highlighted by high contribution scores matched conserved catalytic triads and substrate-binding clefts across PET-, PCL-, and PLA-degrading enzymes. Furthermore, structural modeling confirmed the trustworthiness of PEPIC predictions. Finally, PEPIC predicted an uncurated enzyme as a PET-degrading enzyme, which was biologically validated to hydrolyze bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). These findings demonstrate that PEPIC provides accurate and trustworthy predictions of PDEs, facilitating the discovery of novel enzymes and supporting the development of sustainable plastic biodegradation technologies.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The first recommended malaria vaccine, RTS,S, provides only partial, allele-specific protection with waning immunity over time and the more recently developed R21 vaccine will likely encounter the same hurdles. To address these challenges, we developed a computational tool that integrates P. falciparum sequence diversity, predicted T cell epitope-HLA binding affinities, and HLA allele frequencies from sub-Saharan Africa to identify conserved, immunogenic epitopes with broad population coverage. We analyzed 42 P. falciparum proteins, previously identified as vaccine candidate antigens, and generated consensus sequences using data from 18 African countries, and then incorporated HLA allele frequencies from 24 sub-Saharan populations. CD8+ and CD4+ T cell epitopes were predicted using NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCIIpan-4.1. Our novel tool, T cell Epitope Nomination (TEpiNom) used greedy optimization to filter and select epitopes based on epitope sequence conservation (>95%), binding affinity (median rank <10%), and broad HLA coverage, minimizing redundancy to reduce immune escape risk. Our tool identified 2,265 MHC I and 1,992 MHC II conserved epitopes spanning pre-erythrocytic, erythrocytic, and sexual stage proteins. Key MHC I epitopes from pre-erythrocytic antigens HSP70-2, SLARP/SAP1, p36, FabZ, LISP1, LSA1, UIS3, p24_2, PL, and FabG achieved near 100% HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C coverage, and MHC II epitopes from pre-erythrocytic, erythrocytic, or sexual antigens provided 98.5%-100% coverage for a given parasite life stage.

The OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), widely used to support EHR data integration and analysis, leverages CVX, RxNorm, and RxNorm Extension codes to standardize vaccine-related records. However, these terminologies lack robust semantic relations, making the vaccine classification ineffective in OMOP CDM. To address this issue, our OHDSI Vaccine Vocabulary Working Group proposes to use the Vaccine Ontology (VO) to map these standards and build up its own semantic relations. As a first study of the work, we performed the mapping and alignment of the Vaccine Administered (CVX) codes with the VO using a combination of semi-automatic and manual mapping methods. Results. A total of 273 CVX terms were first collected and classified. A high-level VO design pattern and an exact one-to-one mapping strategy were developed to guide the CVX-to-VO term mapping. To facilitate the manual mapping and harmonization process, we also developed and evaluated three semi-automated mapping approaches utilizing lexical and semantic information of vaccine concepts to map CVX to VO. These approaches suggested candidate VO mappings for CVX terms and also indicated CVX terms that were unmappable to VO and required new term additions to VO. The application of the best approach to the 2022-10-05 release of VO achieved an accuracy of 85.55% for its suggestions. The suggestions made by the semi-automated approaches were taken into account to further enhance the mappings, which led to our eventual mapping of all CVX terms to the latest version of VO. We innovatively proposed the inclusion of the 'passive vaccine' branch in VO, which includes 24 immunoglobulins and antitoxins from CVX as passive vaccines. A specific CVX-VO OWL file was developed and added to the VO GitHub. Use case queries were developed to demonstrate its support for computer-assisted queries of vaccine groups based on CVX-VO hierarchies. Conclusion. All CVX terms were mapped to the VO using our combined semi-automatic and manual mapping methods.

The dynein intermediate chain (IC) binding to TcTex1 and LC8 provides a system for investigating how biological systems may induce such imperfection and utilize it for biological function. LC8 and Tctex1 are homologous proteins, both fold as rotationally symmetric intertwined homodimers which bind to two copies of a client protein, enabling dimerization of the client. LC8 is known to bind over 100 different proteins and has been shown to bind it clients cooperatively, with the second client binding with higher affinity than the first. It is not known whether Tctex1 binding is cooperative, but it does bind to several different partners. Along IC, the LC8 and Tctex1 binding sites are close to one another resulting in additional cooperativity effects. Herein we successfully model the 7-state model of IC/LC8/Tctex1 binding, thereby extracting more information about biologically relevant transitions than have been previously accessed. Our analysis uses Bayesian inference to combine the results from 39 different isotherms to obtain narrow distributions for thermodynamic values. We report the first measurement of cooperativity across subsequent bindings to TcTex1, along with the weakest known cooperativity across LC8 binding.

The fluctuating biomaterial comprises photoswitchable azobenzene attached to a glass surface and terminated with peptide c(RGDfK). Upon irradiation with light at 530 nm, the azobenzenes rapidly fluctuate between an extended and contracted conformation, leading to a change in the length of the azobenzene that stimulates integrins bound to c(RGDfK). The mathematical model mimics the nascent adhesion and spatial fluctuations in the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) and is calibrated using single-cell force microscopy retraction curves. It relies on spring-based mechanics to describe the stretch and deformation of a cell and ensembles of integrins when applied to a fluctuating biomaterial. We use the model to simulate retraction curves and the proportion of bound integrins on the surface as the material fluctuates. Additionally, we use the model to predict SCFS retraction curves for varying experimental conditions. This includes the length of time the cell (attached to the tip of the atomic force microscopy cantilever) is kept in contact with the biomaterial before retraction, and for varying frequency of light-induced movement of the azobenzene conformations. These model outcomes provide an attractive route to integrate and rigorously control certain experimental variables, thus accelerating experimental design of the study of cell adhesion to light-responsive biomaterials. Furthermore the model complements experiments by providing estimates of variables that are experimentally inaccessible. Thus, the outcomes of the model provide a valuable resource to aid in the interpretation and design of light-responsive biointerface functionalities.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Understanding early TME remodeling dynamics is therefore crucial for developing interceptive therapies. However, clinical samples typically provide isolated, late tumorigenesis snapshots. To overcome this limitation, we generated triple-negative breast cancer mice that developed multifocal, asynchronous tumors along a continuous tumor luminal-to-basal transdifferentiation trajectory. Ordering spatial transcriptomes from 100+ ducts along this trajectory revealed the spatiotemporal dynamics of TME remodelling and underlying molecular mechanisms. During tumor progression, cancer-associated-myofibroblasts (myCAFs) orchestrated pro-invasive extracellular matrix remodeling. myCAFs were conserved in patient-derived xenograft models and co-injection experiments in immunocompetent mice validated their ability to steer tumor trajectories towards invasive phenotypes.

A.", "abstract": "Background Digoxin and other agents are frequently administered to arrest fetal circulation before the evacuation of human fetal tissue (HFT) in pregnancy terminations to address concerns about fetal viability. However, the impact of delayed evacuation on HFT quality remains unknown. Analyzing HFT is critical for diagnosing pregnancies affected by fetal abnormalities and for driving progress in biomedical research. Objective This study aims to assess the effects of delayed evacuation following fetal circulation cessation on the quality of HFT for both diagnostic and research purposes. Study Design HFT samples were collected from second-trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedures, with and without agent injection approximately 24 hours prior, as per standard care protocols. We assessed multiple parameters relevant to diagnostics and research, including: 1) cell morphology, 2) cell proliferation, 3) apoptosis, 4) cell viability in culture, and 5) nucleic acid quality. To simulate in utero conditions and determine the timeline for tissue degradation, we incubated brain tissue obtained from D&E without induced demise at 37{degrees}C for up to 18 hours. Results We analyzed 18 HFT samples from D&E procedures performed 19-25 hours after digoxin or potassium chloride (KCl) injection and compared them to 26 HFT samples from immediate evacuations without prior injection. Induced fetal demise resulted in 1) disrupted cell morphology, 2) decreased cell proliferation, 3) increased apoptosis, 4) reduced cell viability in culture, and 5) lower RNA quality. Despite these findings, all samples yielded DNA of sufficient quality for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusion D&E procedures performed after fetal demise induced by digoxin or KCl lead to decreased HFT quality, limiting its diagnostic and research potential beyond gross tissue evaluation and DNA extraction. Limiting the time between fetal circulation arrest and evacuation may improve HFT quality for clinical and research applications.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, are hypothesized to contribute to its lasting therapeutic benefits. In this exploratory study, we present the first methylome-wide analysis of psilocybin-induced changes in a cohort of detoxified patients with AUD. The longitudinal study design included three assessment days in 40 patients with blood sampling and acquisition of psychometrics - at baseline, 24 hours after administration of psilocybin (25 mg) or placebo (mannitol), and one month after treatment. Our epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) identified one CpG site in TLE4 (p = 1.1e-7) associated with psilocybin treatment. Screening for differentially methylated regions, we observed altered methylation in the gene RASGRP4 (pFDR = 3.2e-4). Network analysis revealed co-methylation modules related to psilocybin treatment, as well as modules associated with the reduction of depressive symptoms and drinking behavior. Gene ontology analysis indicated involvement of these modules in neuroplasticity and immune functions, suggesting that they may reflect abstinence-related recovery processes. Investigating candidate genes at nominal significance (p < 0.05) uncovered promoter-associated methylation changes in HTR2A and TNF. Furthermore, at p < 0.05, we found baseline differences between treatment responders (< 1 standard unit alcohol in 4-week follow-up) and non-responders in genes related to synaptic plasticity and different neurotransmitter systems. While these findings are limited by the modest sample size, they align well with previous literature and might provide starting points for further, large-scale investigations or hypothesis-driven experiments.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The role of the ubiquitous store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in histone responses is also unknown. Here, studying endothelial cells in surgical preparations and in culture, we observed clinically relevant histone concentrations, produced fast plasma membrane movements including vesiculation, blebbing, ruffling, and cellular collapse. The cell membrane theatrics observed were markedly different from the uniform pattern of exocytosis and blebbing produced by calcium overload with ionomycin. Interestingly, membrane permeabilization produced by histones (and not ionomycin) was transient and a subset of cells recovered membrane integrity within 1 hour. A role for SOCE in histone responses was ruled out by genetic ablation of the ORAI1/2/3 channel trio. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ prevented histone-induced intracellular Ca2+ overload while surprisingly exacerbating plasma membrane deformation. Conversely, decreasing the density of the negative charge surface by adding calcium or multivalent cations gadolinium or increasing extracellular Ca2+ levels effectively screened common membrane phospholipids from interactions with labeled histones and prevented endothelial damage in cells exposed to histones. Collectively, these results indicate that low extracellular Ca2+ levels enhance interactions between histones and endothelial cell membrane phospholipids to increase cytotoxicity. Importantly, this supports the concept of aggressive Ca2+ repletion during resuscitation to prevent hypocalcemia, stabilize the endothelial cell membranes and improve cardiovascular recovery from shock.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

In a natural cross-over design, we quantified responses to training and matches at sea level and altitude. Methods: Total, and high-speed, running distance and differential session ratings of perceived exertion for breathlessness (s-RPE-B) and leg exertion (s-RPE-L) were collected from 19 professional soccer players (age: 27.3 {+/-} 3.4 years, stature: 181.2 {+/-} 5.9cm, mass: 78.7 {+/-} 8.1kg) at sea-level and altitude. Data were collected for matches raining sessions one and two days pre match. Results: Differences between altitude conditions were estimated through mixed-linear modeling, with 95% confidence intervals representing values highly compatible with our observed data. In matches, total distance may have been reduced (95% confidence intervals 43 to -833 m, surprisal [s] = 3.74) and s-RPE-B may have increased (-0.6 to 10.7, s = 3.66) at altitude. A clear perceptual shift was observed with s-RPE-B increasing relative to s-RPE-L (-13.4 to -7.17, s >13) at altitude.

This fast growth makes S. viridis a valuable model for C4 crop research. Genetic crosses are essential for studying gene function, but manual crossing is labor intensive and time consuming. To address this, we developed a male sterile line by targeting the S. viridis ortholog of Setaria italica NO POLLEN 1 (SiNP1), which encodes a glucose methanol choline oxidoreductase required for pollen exine formation. Using Cas9 and TREX2 mediated genome editing, we generated SiNP1 knockouts in both the S. viridis ME034V and A10.1 backgrounds that were fully male sterile. Backcrossing T0 male sterile plants to ME034V yielded a stable line homozygous for a 59 bp deletion, easily genotyped by PCR. Using this line, we developed a simple and efficient crossing protocol that eliminates the need for emasculation. This method enables a single person to perform up to 100 crosses per day compared to 15 using traditional methods and yields 20 to 32 F1 hybrid seeds per panicle with 100% genetic purity. We also quantified pollen flow and outcrossing frequencies under greenhouse conditions to develop optimal bagging strategies and prevent unintended pollination.This resource accelerates genetic research in S. viridis, enhancing its utility as a premier C4 model for mapping and functional genomics.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

K.; Bousios, A.; Nuetzmann, H.-W.", "abstract": "Background: The movement of transposable elements (TEs) in somatic cells generates genetic and phenotypic diversity across the soma of individual organisms. This process is especially important in plants that display a sessile lifestyle, can regenerate from somatic cells, and continuously establish their germline from somatic stem cells. Yet, the scale and integration biases by which TEs may shape the plant soma remain unknown. Results: We adapt high-throughput TE sequencing and introduce a new computational pipeline, deNOVOEnrich, to identify and analyse somatic transposition events in Arabidopsis thaliana. We detect ~200,000 new TE insertions across wild-type and epigenetic mutant backgrounds, revealing en masse active transposition in the plant soma. Similar to germline dynamics, somatic integration is non-random and TE-specific. Focusing on the ONSEN, EVADE and AtCOPIA21 families, we find they preferentially integrate into chromosomal arms and genic DNA, and are enriched over H2A.Z, H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 labelled chromatin. However, ONSEN dynamically targets active and open chromatin, while EVADE displays a depletion in these regions, consistent with niche targeting at the local epigenetic level and spatial distribution across the genome ecosystem. We further demonstrate that environmentally-responsive genes such as resistance (R) genes and biosynthetic gene clusters are preferred integration targets, highlighting the adaptive potential of somatic transposition. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that transposon amplification is an explosive and structured event that generates cellular mosaicism in the soma of A. thaliana. We speculate that this phenomenon is common across plants under permissive conditions, both in experimental and natural settings.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

According to the discontinuity theory of immunity, effector responses depend on how quickly an antigenic stimulus changes: rapid change triggers an immune response, whereas gradual change fosters tolerance. We present a model of adaptive immune dynamics including T cells, Tregs and cytokines that reproduces the hallmarks of the discontinuity theory. The model allows for sharp discrimination between acute and chronic infections based on the growth rate of the immune challenge, and vaccination-like acute dynamics upon presentation of a bolus of immune challenge. We further show that the model behavior only depends on a handful of testable assumptions that we map to geometric constraints in phase space. This suggests that the model properties are generic and robust across alternative mechanistic details. We also examine the impact of multiple concurrent immune challenges in this model, and demonstrate the occurrence of dynamical antagonism, wherein, in some parameter regimes, slow-growing challenges hinder acute responses to fast-growing ones, with further counter-intuitive behaviors for sequential co-infections. Together, these results place the discontinuity theory on firm mathematical footing and encourage further investigation of interferences of multi-agent immune challenges, from chronic viral co-infections to cancer immunoediting.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

While crowding disrupts target perception when nearby elements fall within the same spatial pooling window, specific flanker configurations can alleviate this effect through Gestalt-based grouping, a phenomenon known as uncrowding. Here, we examined the temporal dynamics underlying these spatial organization processes using a Vernier discrimination task. In Experiment 1, we varied stimulus duration and found that uncrowding emerged only after 160 ms, suggesting a time-consuming process. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the target and flankers. We found that presenting good-Gestalt flankers briefly before the target (as little as 32 ms) significantly boosted uncrowding, even in the absence of temporal overlap between the two stimuli. This effect was specific to conditions in which flankers preceded the target, ruling out pure temporal integration and masking accounts. These findings suggest that spatial segmentation can be dynamically facilitated when the temporal order of presentation allows grouping mechanisms to engage prior to target processing. Moreover, the observed time course indicates that segmentation is not purely feedforward, particularly for stimuli that are likely to recruit higher-level visual areas, pointing instead to the involvement of recurrent or feedback processes.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

These artifacts, which originate from insufficient crushing of unwanted coherence transfer pathways (CTPs), are particularly challenging in editing schemes for metabolites like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutathione (GSH). To address this, a volume-based likelihood model was developed to guide gradient scheme optimization, prioritizing suppression of CTPs based on likelihood. A volume-based likelihood model for CTP weighting was integrated into a Dephasing optimization through coherence order pathway selection (DOTCOPS) gradient optimization. Using a genetic algorithm with a new dual-penalty cost function, gradient schemes were optimized to maximize pathway-specific suppression. Hardware and sequence constraints, maximum gradient amplitudes and delay durations respectively, informed the optimization. Validation of the optimized scheme was performed with simulations and in vivo using an edited sequence in three brain regions (posterior cingulate cortex PCC, thalamus, and medial prefrontal cortex mPFC), with particular focus on OOV artifact reduction and spectral quality improvements. The optimized gradient scheme demonstrated improved k-space crushing efficiency (by an average of 197%). OOV artifacts were reduced in all brain regions, particularly in highly OOV-susceptible regions (thalamus and mPFC). Improvements were most notable around 4.3 ppm with significant OOV amplitude reductions (p < 0.001).

Design: In the DMM mouse model, IOP was administered through intra-articular (i.a.) injection, either alone or combined with a thermosensitive hydrogel to enable sustained release. Histological analyses included Safranin O/Fast Green staining and OARSI scoring. Immunohistochemistry was performed for COL2, MMP13, and CCDC80 to evaluate anabolic, catabolic, and hypertrophic markers. Micro-CT assessed subchondral bone changes. In the ex vivo studies, IOP was applied to lesioned human osteochondral OA explants. Matrix degradation and repair were evaluated by sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) release, Mankin histology scores, and RT-qPCR for cartilage matrix genes. Results: Administration of IOP significantly reduced cartilage degeneration in DMM mice (P [&le;] 1.0x10-4), characterized by increased COL2, and decreased MMP13 and CCDC80 expression. Notably, IOP also prevented pathological subchondral bone thickening. In human explants, IOP treatment led to a significant reduction in sGAG release compared to untreated explants on day 6 of the IOP treatment. Moreover, Mankin scores were significantly improved in IOP-treated compared to untreated explants, indicating reduced cartilage degradation. Conclusion: IOP demonstrates strong chondroprotective effects, reducing cartilage degradation and promoting repair in OA models. Its combination with a thermosensitive hydrogel amplifies therapeutic potential, offering a promising strategy for OA treatment. Next steps are to optimize delivery and validate early molecular effects.

We present ``AI for Models of Ecosystems'' (AIME), a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary optimization to automate the discovery of interpretable ecological models from time-series data. AIME addresses the inverse problem of inferring ecologically meaningful mechanistic models that explain observed data while maintaining biological plausibility. We critically review AIME's ability to recover known ecological relationships through two complementary marine case studies: (1) a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model, and (2) a Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) model. In the first case, our best models displayed almost perfect recovery of known ecological dynamics while maintaining strong predictive performance across multivariate time-series. In the second case, best AIME generated models approached human expert models in terms of their ability to successfully capture COTS outbreak dynamics and demonstrated strong out-of-sample predictive power. AIME produces interpretable models with meaningful parameters that capture real biological processes, facilitating scientific insight and potentially accelerating management applications. By dramatically accelerating model development while offering ecological interpretability, AIME offers a powerful new tool for addressing urgent ecological challenges in rapidly changing environments.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in integrating these processes, particularly during stressful conditions such as pathogenic infections. Yet the molecular mechanisms governing this integration remain poorly understood. TCER-1, the C. elegans homolog of mammalian TCERG1, suppresses immunity and promotes fertility, especially upon maternal infection. Here, we show that TCER-1 regulates two conserved lysosomal lipases, lipl-1 and lipl-2, to balance reproduction, immunity and lifespan. Using transcriptomic, lipidomic, and molecular-genetic analyses, we demonstrate that while both lipl-1 and lipl-2 mediate infection-induced lipid remodeling, lipl-1 enhances immunity and catalyzes the accumulation of ceramide species linked to stress response and longevity, whereas, lipl-2 unexpectedly does not. Both lipases contribute towards fertility outcomes, but lipl-2 is especially critical for maintaining embryonic-eggshell integrity during maternal infection and aging. Strikingly, expression of human lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), the ortholog of lipl genes, rescues the immune defects triggered by lipl-l loss and enhances immune resilience. Together, these findings uncover functionally distinct roles for lipl-1 and lipl-2 in modulating lipid species that shape immune fitness, healthspan and reproductive health, and suggest a potentially conserved mechanism by which lipid metabolism links fertility and immunity.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

However, the extreme heterozygosity poses challenges for many genomic analyses, including studying meiotic recombination. Here, we present a novel bioinformatic pipeline that enables direct detection of crossover (CO) and non-crossover (NCO) recombination events using short-read whole-genome sequencing of a two-generation pedigree (two parents and 104 F1 offspring) of the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae. Using parental assemblies generated by Platanus-allee as a custom reference for read alignment, we tracked inheritance patterns in offspring and phased contig-level haplotypes in parents, allowing us to detect recombination events. We identified 2,329 paternal and 2,288 maternal COs, yielding recombination rates of 4.57 cM/Mb and 4.49 cM/Mb, respectively. We found CO coldspots spanning >140 Mb in each parent and these are likely associated with large-scale heterozygous inversions. CO rates were positively correlated with transposable element and gene density in both sexes, but showed weak or no correlation with GC content. We further identified ~10,000 paternal and ~5,800 maternal NCO events, predominantly <200 bp in length, and found evidence of GC-biased gene conversion. This work provides the first direct and genome-wide measurement of recombination in amphioxus and demonstrates how high heterozygosity, often considered a barrier, can be leveraged for fine-scale recombination mapping.

It is unclear whether the high heterozygosity in amphioxus is due to a large effective population size, an increased mutation rate, or both. Here, we perform deep short-read whole genome sequencing of a two-generation pedigree of the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae comprising two parents and 104 offspring, and develop a framework based on allele-aware parental assemblies as the reference to accurately identify DNMs. We detect 256 high-confidence DNMs, yielding a genome-wide mutation rate of 4.41 x 10-9 per base per generation which is comparable to that of vertebrates. By combining this estimate with observed genomic heterozygosity of B. floridae, we obtain an effective population size of ~2.2 million, indicating that its extreme heterozygosity mainly results from a large effective population size.

We investigated these relationships in young seabirds (Black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla) with facultative siblicide and robust HPA-axis activity, considering environmental context and genetic sex. First, we assessed potential impacts of behavior on corticosterone by quantifying behavior of first-hatched chicks in nests containing two chicks for 60 min before taking a baseline blood sample, restraining for 15 min, then bleeding again. The only behavior that predicted subsequent corticosterone levels was feeding (fewer feeds = higher restraint-induced corticosterone). However, there was evidence for consequences of increased corticosterone secretion on behavior: post-restraint corticosterone levels were positively correlated with increases in begging and aggression in the subsequent hour, primarily in males. Larger corticosterone response to restraint was also associated with more rapid brood reduction. Corticosterone:behavior relationships were eliminated in chicks from food-supplemented nests. To evaluate potential causality of corticosterone in redirecting behavior, we isolated it from other components of the endogenous stress response using minimally-disruptive exogenous topical treatments, and confirmed a positive relationship between corticosterone and aggression (stronger in males), but not begging or feeding. We conclude that elevation of endogenous corticosterone is negatively correlated with recent feeding rates, and is subsequently associated with rapid, sex- and context-specific changes in kittiwake chick behaviors, at least some of which are causally driven by elevated corticosterone and associated with fitness-relevant consequences.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

While composition-aware models can mitigate this issue, their computational demands often preclude their use in large-scale analyses. We present WitChi, a computationally efficient tool for identifying and removing compositionally biased alignment columns using empirical significance testing. WitChi calculates taxon-specific chi-squared scores and compares them to null distributions derived from column permutations that preserve the phylogenetic structure of the alignment. Sites most responsible for significant deviation are iteratively pruned using one of three scoring algorithms, continuing until no taxa remain significantly biased or until further pruning would reduce the overall alignment chi-squared score below the expected null range. Z-scores and p-values are provided for both taxa and alignments, offering interpretable metrics of bias severity. Pruning of simulated compositional heterogeneous alignments show that WitChi reliably restores correct topologies under standard, compositionally stationary models. In benchmarks, WitChi outperforms or matches BMGE's stationary-based trimming while scaling linearly with taxon number. Applied to the archaeal GTDB r220 dataset (5,869 taxa; 10,101 sites), WitChi completes pruning in under two hours on four CPU cores.

In particular, the iron influxes that accompany WAT browning induce the activity of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA), an enzyme that reverses the oxidation of proteinaceous methionine residues. Mechanistically, iron coordination by the conserved iron-binding motifs (E203-xx-H206) of two MSRA polypeptides serves to multimerize, stabilize, and enzymatically activate MSRA. This in turns facilitates adipose browning by maintaining the reduced state of two methionines near the ATP-binding site of Protein Kinase A (PKA). Remarkably, in mouse models of PDA, MsrA deletion impairs WAT browning, significantly mitigates cachexia, and improves the overall survival of tumor-bearing animals.

When roots are grown on the surface of a substrate, growth occurs with an undulating trajectory known as root waving, which is likely due to a combination of gravity and touch responses. However, the cellular and molecular details behind root waving, remain obscure. We identified WALLFLOWER (WFL), a transmembrane receptor kinase that influences the shape of waves during root growth. WFL fused to green fluorescent protein (WFL-GFP) strongly accumulates in the root elongation zone where it is localized to the inner polar domain of epidermal cells. wfl mutants have longer hypocotyls and altered root waving with deeper waves. Morphometric imaging revealed that specific root epidermal cell types are longer in the mutant. Abnormal wfl phenotypes are rescued by WFL-GFP, but not by a truncated version of WFL missing its intracellular domains. Unexpectedly, this truncated version of WFL remains polarly localized but accumulates at the opposite (outer) polar domain. This indicates the WFL kinase domain is crucial for function and correct localization and suggests that WFL may operate locally.

Among the diverse array of multiscale modelling tools, off-lattice center-based agent-based models (CBM) offer a promising approach due to their depiction of cells in 3D space, closely resembling biological reality. Despite the proliferation of CBM tools addressing various biomedical challenges, a comprehensive and systematic comparison among them has been elusive. This paper presents a community-driven benchmark initiative aimed at evaluating and comparing CBM for biomedical applications, akin to successful efforts in other scientific domains such as the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP). Enlisting developers from leading tools like BioDynaMo, Chaste, PhysiCell,TiSim, and CompuTiX, we devised a benchmark scope, defined metrics, and established reference datasets to ensure a meaningful and equitable evaluation. Unit tests targeting different solvers within these tools were designed, ranging from diffusion and mechanics to cell cycle simulations and growth scenarios. Results from these tests demonstrate varying tool implementations in handling diffusion, mechanics, and cell cycle equations, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarks and interoperability. Discussions among the community underscore the necessity for defining gold standards, fostering interoperability, and drawing lessons from analogous benchmarking experiences. The outcomes, disseminated through a public platform in collaboration with OpenEBench, aim to catalyse advancements in computational biology, offering a comprehensive resource for tool evaluation and guiding future developments in cell-level simulations. This initiative endeavours to strengthen and expand the computational biology simulation community through continued dissemination and performance-oriented benchmarking efforts to enable the use of VHT in biomedicine.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The detrimental effects of chronic lung inflammation on mental health are well recognized, however, underlying mechanisms are not known. Here, using a murine model of allergic asthma we report compromised fear extinction in mice with severe but not mild airway inflammation (AI); an effect abolished by anti-interleukin-17A (IL-17A) antibodies. Investigation of innate immune cells, microglia as-well-as transcriptomic signatures in the subfornical organ (SFO), a brain interoceptive node lacking a traditional blood-brain-barrier, revealed significant alterations in severe AI mice. IL-17 Receptor A (IL-17RA) was expressed in SFO microglia and upregulated in severe AI mice. Notably, ablation of microglial IL-17RA improved fear extinction in severe AI mice. Furthermore, we identified direct SFO projections to the infralimbic (IL) cortex, a key area regulating extinction. Importantly, chemogenetic inhibition of the SFO-IL circuit led to improved fear extinction in severe AI mice. Collectively, we report a unique body-to-brain interoceptive mechanism engaging the SFO and an SFO-to-IL circuit, through which airway inflammatory mediators compromise fear extinction.

New evidence suggests that the mouse-human transmission barrier of -syn is lower than previously reported, emphasizing the need for improved biosafety procedures when working with -syn aggregates. Histopathology of -syn-infected brain represents a significant potential source of occupational exposure, and current methods for tissue fixation do not inactivate the ability of pathologic -syn to seed the conversion of endogenous, monomeric -syn into fibrils. In this study, we tested whether 96% formic acid treatment could reduce the seeding activity of -syn aggregates in paraformaldehyde-fixed brain samples from dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients and -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF)-injected mouse brains. Using real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), we found that formic acid treatment reduced -syn seeding dose (picograms of -syn seeds per ml of brain homogenate) in DLB and mouse brain by 6 and 8 logarithms, respectively. RT-QuIC reactions seeded with formic acid-treated brain homogenates showed significantly longer lag phase, and decreased total thioflavin T fluorescence compared to untreated samples, indicating that formic acid treatment impairs the ability of pathological -syn to seed monomeric -syn. Importantly, the -syn pathologic features and the immunostaining quality were preserved in formic acid-treated tissues. Our results demonstrate that formic acid treatment is a quick and efficient procedure for reducing -syn seeding activity in fixed brain samples, thereby lowering the risk of accidental exposure in laboratories without compromising the quality of histopathological analysis.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

SCAN interdigitates somatomotor networks and is functionally connected to the cingulo-opercular/action-mode network. SCAN is therefore thought to play a role in motor/action planning. This view of SCAN, however, is based on its \"static\" functional connectivity--i.e. FC estimated using data pooled over an entire scan session or dataset. However, this approach necessarily overlooks changes in network activity and connectivity that occurs over shorter timescales. In this report, we extend analyses of SCAN's static architecture, demonstrating that, at the whole-brain level, SCAN vertices exhibit overlapping network membership, such that, while they form a cohesive sub-network, they may also couple transiently and dynamically with other networks. We examine these potential co-activations by focusing on SCAN dynamics and through the identification of distinct coupling modes -- co-activation patterns (CAPs).

G.; Kaminski Schierle, G.", "abstract": "Over the past decade, air-liquid interface cerebral organoids (ALI-COs) have emerged as powerful in vitro models that capture essential structural and functional traits of the human brain, offering an exciting alternative to traditional animal models in neuroscience. Yet, the full potential of these systems has remained untapped due to the lack of non-invasive, long-term electrophysiological tools capable of preserving organoid integrity. Existing techniques, ranging from patch clamping to rigid and 3D microelectrode arrays, often compromise organoid growth and disrupt delicate cytoarchitecture. Here, we present NeuroSuite, an innovative bioelectronic platform designed to overcome these challenges. At its core is Neuroweb, a perforated, ultra-thin, and conformable organic microelectrode array engineered for minimal disruption of nutrient and oxygen exchange. Neuroweb is reusable and supports stable recordings for over six months, making it uniquely suited for longitudinal studies. Coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), a high-performance mixed ionic-electronic conductor, Neuroweb delivers exceptional signal-to-noise ratio recordings with high spatial precision. By pairing Neuroweb with NeuroMaps, an intuitive software for interactive analysis and visualisation, NeuroSuite enables long-term, non-invasive tracking and spatial mapping of electrical activity from brain organoids and ex vivo brain slices at the air-liquid interface. Following rigorous validation, we demonstrate that NeuroSuite can capture both high- and low-frequency throughout maturation. Our pipeline reveals evolving network connectivity, including the development of GABA-ergic interneurons, and concurrent shifts in high-frequency spiking and low-frequency oscillations indicative of a refinement in the excitatory-inhibitory balance. Finally, automated data acquisition and spatial spike mapping highlight local activity changes in response to media composition, a factor often overlooked in conventional recordings. NeuroSuite thus opens a new frontier in organoid neuroscience, enabling precise, long-term monitoring essential for modelling neurological diseases, understanding human brain development, and accelerating drug discovery.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

To elucidate how obesity impacts pancreatic immune homeostasis, we performed spatial, transcriptomic and functional profiling of human pancreatic immune cells from obese and non-obese organ donors. Obesity was associated with higher density of tissue resident memory T-cells (TRM) in the exocrine pancreas which display high cytotoxic functions and aggregated around macrophages. Single cell sequencing of pancreatic macrophages revealed two main subsets - FOLR2+ CD11c- fetal-derived macrophages with pro-repair and immunoregulatory function and a FOLR2- CD11c+ monocyte-derived macrophages with greater T-cell interactions and pro-inflammatory function. In obesity, the pancreatic macrophage landscape shifts to lower predominance of FOLR2+ CD11c- macrophages and higher FOLR2- CD11c+ macrophages which interact selectively with the TRM and inflamed exocrine epithelium. Together, these results identify macrophage-T cell circuits and immune epithelial interactions that fuel chronic pancreatic inflammation in obesity - a potential unifying mechanism for obesity-related pancreatic diseases.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), such as Steinernema carpocapsae, experience rapid desiccation (RD) upon application to foliar surfaces, significantly reducing their biocontrol efficacy. Protective strategies employed by the rapidly desiccating EPNs, and their potential improvement through formulations, have been largely unexplored. We determined the protective physiological and molecular mechanisms employed by S. carpocapsae in non formulated (control) and formulated treatments to withstand RD under different humidity levels. Building on previous results, we hypothesized that titania Pickering emulsion (TPE) and silica Pickering emulsion gel (SPEG) will enhance EPN survival and efficacy through distinct changes in physiological and molecular mechanisms. We determined the effect of RD using gravimetric analysis, confocal microscopy, transcriptomics, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography and ultrastructural (scanning and transmission electron microscopy) assessments. Our results indicate that SPEG and TPE temper the impact of RD in EPNs through diverse physiological mechanisms. Formulated EPNs exhibited significantly delayed water loss and enhanced survival under low humidity compared to controls. Confocal microscopy indicated two distinct protective mechanisms: the primary mode of action in SPEG was retention of hydration on the nematode, whereas TPE effectively slowed water loss from the nematode body. These protective mechanisms correlated strongly with differential patterns of trehalose accumulation, providing biochemical confirmation of formulation efficacy. Transcriptome analysis and ultrastructural validation highlighted the adaptive mechanisms such as extracellular matrix remodeling, including basement membrane integrity and cytoskeletal reorganization as critical components of EPNs adaptative response to RD.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

We detected widespread polycistronic-like RNAs associated with approximately 60% of transcribed genes in two Populus species: black cottonwood and the hybrid 717. Thousands of incomplete dicistronic gene loci were identified, many of which encode modified or fusion open reading frames (ORFs), and are drought-responsive and functionally linked to organelles and cellular membrane systems. These polycistronic RNAs are frequently alternatively spliced and exhibit longer poly(A) tails and distinct mA base modifications compared to their monocistronic counterparts. Additionally, we observed a positive expression correlation between monocistronic gene pairs within dicistronic loci, with a particularly strong correlation between polycistronic RNAs and the monocistronic gene at the 5' end of the polycistronic locus. This suggests a complex regulatory mechanism governing transcription from incomplete polycistronic gene loci in Populus.

At the mating-type locus, we find the most frequent pause site outside the rDNA. At centromeres, we find that replication initiation predominantly occurs in the outer repeats, while termination localises to central regions and that, only in centromere 2, there is an enrichment in pauses at the centromeric tRNAs.

In this paper, we present recording methods for detection of discrete unit 150-3000 Hz bandpass filtered extracellular spikes in biofilm forming liquid cultures of Hericium erinaceus. We utilised custom designed microelectrode arrays (MEAs) with passive planar hard gold microelectrodes and individual radius of 100 {micro}m in recordings at a sample rate of 30 kHz. Triplicate recordings of mycelial samples in a double shielded electromagnetic and RF shield box were conducted for wild-type, ionophore assays and fungicidal assays. The recordings were analysed offline using the Kilosort4 sorting algorithm resulting in detection of discrete unit spikes with milliseconds durations. The clustered spike waveforms for the wild-type triplicates were estimated to have a mean trough-to-peak-time of 2.68 {+/-} 0.087 ms and width at half maximum of 0.8 {+/-} 0.031 ms across a combined total of 418 spiking units. Ionophore assays using nystatin solution (10,000 units/ml) exhibited significant statistical differences including a reduction of total units to 97. A decrease in the trough-to-peak time of the mean waveform (1.97 {+/-} 0.32 ms) and an increase in the width at half maximum (2.7 {+/-} 2.45 ms) were also observed.

Similar ideas underlie machine learning models and search algorithms such as simulated annealing, although executed on non-equilibrium architectures at enormous energy cost. Physically implementing thermodynamically favoured computation is a decades-long challenge that could reduce dependence on fuel-consuming error-correction and precise kinetic control.

ATRX alterations are identified in 10% of high-risk neuroblastomas and associated with poor outcomes. The commonest type of ATRX alterations in neuroblastoma are in-frame multi-exon deletions, followed by nonsense mutations predicted to result in loss-of-function (ATRX LoF). We treated paired ATRX wild-type and ATRX LoF neuroblastoma cell lines with RA and show that cells with ATRX LoF fail to upregulate direct RA target genes. Cells with ATRX LoF also show reduced chromatin accessibility at genes involved in differentiation and development following RA treatment. Conversely, neuroblastoma models with in-frame deletions mount a response to RA and show in-vitro sensitivity to RA. Taken together this shows that the mechanism of differentiation in ATRX-altered neuroblastoma depends on the type of ATRX alteration, with implications relating to both oncogenesis and therapeutic response.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The prevailing hypothesis is that activation of stress responsive pathways, including the amino acid deprivation arm of the integrated stress response (ISR; the GCN2-ATF4 pathway) is pro-longevity. Activation of ATF4 orthologs extends lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Caenorhabditis elegans, but its role in other longer-lived organisms remains unclear. We comprehensively tested the role of the GCN2-ATF4 pathway in the fly (Drosophila melanogaster) for the first time. We used conditional genetic manipulation of dGCN2 and its downstream effector Drosophila ATF4 (crc; dATF4). In contrast to previous studies, we show that overexpression of dGCN2 and dATF4 significantly reduces lifespan, while knockdown (in vivo RNAi) of dATF4 extends lifespan. We confirmed dATF4 activity was successfully modulated using a fluorescent dATF4 activation reporter. Borrelidin, a tRNA synthetase inhibitor, significantly reduced lifespan in a both dATF4 and diet-dependent manner, independent of microbial load, showing our modulation of dATF4 altered nutrient to ISR signalling. We further conducted long-read RNA sequencing and found that our manipulation of dATF4 changed global transcription in opposite directions, including known ATF4 target genes. Enrichment analysis revealed that dATF4 overexpression may drive metabolic stress, while dATF4 knockdown upregulates proteostasis and DNA repair pathways. Our work reveals that ATF4 exhibits a dual, dose- and context-dependent role in ageing. Chronic dATF4 activation is detrimental in flies, while chronic suppression is pro-longevity.

In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, SAR depends on the systemic accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), mediated by the transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE), which activates the SA biosynthetic gene ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1). However, the conservation and functional significance of the CHE-ICS1 regulatory module across plant species remain poorly understood, particularly in the Brassicaceae, where ICS1 is the major contributor to SA biosynthesis among two known pathways: the ICS1 and PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE (PAL) routes. Here, we identify natural variation in cis-regulatory elements within the ICS1 promoter that affects CHE binding across species. In multiple Brassicaceae species with divergent cis-element sequences, CHE fails to regulate ICS1, leading to the absence of systemic ICS1 induction and SA accumulation following pathogen infection. Despite this deficiency, SAR still occurs in these species, albeit to a lesser extent than in species with successful systemic induction of SA mediated by an intact CHE-ICS1 regulatory module. Interestingly, introducing the CHE-ICS1 module into species lacking this interaction confers systemic SA accumulation, highlighting the potential to enhance systemic immunity through cis-element modification. Our findings demonstrate that sequence variation in a cis-regulatory element underlies the interspecies diversification of SAR regulatory mechanisms and highlight the evolutionary plasticity of plant immune signaling.

Incomplete digestion narrows proteome coverage and inflates variability in quantitative workflows, whether label-free DIA or multiplexing with isobaric tags. Sequential Lys-C/Trypsin digestions mitigate missed cleavages at lysine residues, but arginine sites remain a persistent challenge. Arg-C Ultra, a recently released cysteine protease, efficiently targets arginine residues but requires reducing conditions that inactivate Lys-C activity and compromise NHS-ester labeling in multiplexed workflows. Here, we systematically characterized Arg-C Ultra and Lys-C with chromogenic substrates that mimic arginine- and lysine-containing peptides, as well as shotgun proteomics. Arg-C Ultra operates optimally at room temperature, pH 7.5-8.5, under reducing conditions, whereas Lys-C is most active at 37 {degrees}C, pH 7.5-8.5, yet rapidly loses activity when exposed to common reductants. Among tested reducing agents, 1 mM TCEP uniquely preserved TMTpro integrity while sustaining Arg-C Ultra activity. Guided by these insights, we established a sequential digestion workflow that is fully compatible with both label-free DIA and TMTpro multiplexing. Proteins are first digested overnight with Lys-C at 37 {degrees}C (pH 8.5), then treated with 1 mM TCEP and Arg-C Ultra at room temperature (pH 8.5). The resulting peptides can be analyzed directly by label-free DIA or subjected to TMTpro labeling for multiplexed quantification.

We sequenced the {beta} TCR repertoires of naive CD4+ T cells of 103 CeD subjects and 103 controls and performed gene usage quantitative trait loci analyses. The naive CD4+ TCR repertoire was significantly affected by HLA and TRA and TRB polymorphisms.

Mice expressing the most common SAVI-associated variant STINGV154M (VM) recapitulate many clinical features of SAVI, including inflammatory lung disease, but do not develop spontaneous skin lesions. In this study, we show that a single low dose of ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, which induces only transient skin inflammation in wild-type (WT) mice, causes severe and progressive skin injury in VM mice. Notably, this phenotype persisted in VM mice depleted of hematopoietic cells and reconstituted with WT bone marrow, demonstrating that STINGV154M expression in non-hematopoietic cells is sufficient to drive persistent skin inflammation. Further analysis identified endothelial cells expressing STINGV154M as the primary driver of the cutaneous phenotype. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing showed that VM mice exhibited reduced early skin infiltration of macrophages and dendritic cells after UVB exposure. These findings establish a critical link between endothelial STING activation, impaired recruitment of skin myeloid cells, and defective resolution of acute inflammation, offering new insights into the pathogenesis of SAVI-associated skin disease.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Histone modifying enzymes are known to drive stem cell differentiation through changes in chromatin accessibility, but little is understood as to how extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics regulate epigenomic remodeling. Here, we utilize alginate hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties to investigate the role of both matrix stiffness and viscoelasticity on histone demethylase expression and activity during osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Our results reveal that the expression of two histone demethylases, KDM4B and KDM6B, are upregulated during osteogenesis in response to stiff, viscoelastic matrix conditions. Inhibition of mechanotransduction signaling pathways reduces expression of KDM4B and KDM6B and hinders osteogenic differentiation overall. Interestingly, phosphorylation of SMAD 1/5/8 was shown to increase in cells cultured in stiff, stress relaxing matrices, and pharmacological inhibition of SMAD 1/5/8 activation reduced expression of KDM4B and KDM6B and decreased osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, our results reveal novel impacts of stem cell mechanotransduction signaling events that promote osteogenesis through epigenetic remodeling.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Adipose-derived stem cell extracellular vesicles (ADSC-EVs) have demonstrated pro-angiogenic properties and have been posited as a novel therapeutic to aid wound healing; however, their functional impact within human-derived multicellular models remains largely uncharacterised. This study explores the development and application of a 3D multicellular in vitro model to assess the effects of ADSC-EVs on vascularisation in the context of wound healing. 3D multicellular in vitro models were developed by co-culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), and fibroblasts within Matrigel to recapitulate the in vivo wound healing microenvironment. A five-colour confocal microscopy panel was developed to visualise each cell type and EVs within the models. The optimised models were then treated ADSC-EVs or control to determine their impact on angiogenesis and cell co-localisation. We determined that vessel formation was significantly enhanced when HUVECs were co-cultured in multicellular models compared to monocultures, with the greatest effect observed in the full three-cell-type model. This effect was even more pronounced with the addition of ADSC-EVs. ADSC-EV treatment also enhanced macrophage co-localisation within endothelial structures.

Despite this, cryptic antisense transcription, occurring opposite to canonical coding sequences, is a pervasive feature across all domains of life. How such potentially harmful cryptic sites are regulated remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that nucleosome arrays within gene bodies play a key role in suppressing cryptic transcription. Using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model, we demonstrate that CHD1-family chromatin remodelers coordinate with the transcription elongation machinery, specifically the PAF complex, to position nucleosomes at sites of cryptic transcription initiation within gene bodies. In the absence of CHD1, AT-rich sequences within gene bodies lose nucleosome occupancy, exposing promoter-like sequences that drive cryptic initiation. While cryptic transcription is generally detrimental, we identify a subset of antisense transcripts that encode critical meiotic genes, suggesting that cryptic transcription can also serve as a source of regulatory innovation.

Yet, the physical origin of this rotation remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence that in quail embryos, the node tissue generates an active chiral torque of 6Nm to drive the chiral tissue flow. Microsurgery experiments reveal that this torque depends on actomyosin molecular activity, is generated within the dorsal node tissue, and requires the underlying ventral meso-/endoderm to act as a mechanical substrate sustaining the counter-torque. We conclude that a dorsoventrally oriented tissue-scale active torque dipole at the node translates cell-scale chirality to organismal L/R asymmetry, adding a mechanical dimension to the canonical function of embryonic organizers as signaling hubs.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Here we describe synthesis of novel STING agonists efficacious against allelic variants of the protein. We also describe genetically humanized STING mice and demonstrate their suitability as a model to evaluate in vivo responses following exogenous administration of human-selective agonists. Experiments demonstrate that the lead molecule (termed INI3069) functions through binding to the STING transmembrane region and its comparison with conventional agonists reveals significant differences in molecular and immune effects.

Therefore, examining environmental change through the lens of microbial ecology is particularly useful for developing a mechanistic understanding of the biogeochemical consequences and feedbacks of perturbations to ecosystems. When aquatic systems with deep anoxic waters undergo eutrophication, the resulting surface productivity impacts the anaerobic microbial community below. The increase in sinking organic carbon can shift the anaerobic community function from inorganic nitrogen (N) loss to N retention, amplifying eutrophication as a positive feedback. However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of this transition, which is critical for anticipating these impacts in aquatic environments where microbial community composition is unknown. Here, we provide a first-principles, quantitative model of this transition from N loss to retention by linking ecological dynamics to the energetics underlying microbial metabolisms. We develop and analyze an ecosystem model in which redox chemistry constrains the traits of key anaerobic N-cycling microbial functional types: denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). The model captures the transition from N loss to N retention with increasing organic carbon supply, consistent with previous observations for specific systems and species. Results identify characteristics of the microbial community composition at the 'net zero N loss' point at which N loss balances N retention, providing testable hypotheses for sequencing data and other observations. By tying microbial ecological dynamics to environmental chemical potential, results provide a broadly applicable framework for improving predictions of the biogeochemical impacts of eutrophication alongside deoxygenation and other ecosystem perturbations.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

These promoters are usually bi-directional, producing transcripts in both directions. Furthermore, these alternative promoters are either part of or closely associated with the ancient retrotransposons that have inserted into the genomes more than 100 million years ago. The oocyte-specific alternative promoter of human SNRPN and the promoter of mammalian AIRN are also believed to have originated from the ancient transposon of similar evolutionary ages. These results are overall consistent with the well-known properties of retrotransposons, de-repression and transcriptional activity in germ cells.

Additionally, radiation therapy, the most common treatment for gliomas, significantly alters the tumor microenvironment, affecting TAMs and contributing to tumor recurrence. Promising preclinical studies have identified and developed drugs targeting TAMs. The development and combined deployment of these therapies require in silico techniques that enable us to optimize their outcomes. To do so, we need mathematical models of glioma growth and therapy response that explicitly incorporate TAMs - an often overlooked component in existing models. Here, we present a dynamical model of glioma growth driven by tumor-immune interactions. The model was parametrized using published data from mice experiments, including responses to ionizing radiation. We used this model to investigate glioma progression under radiotherapy combined with three treatments targeting distinct aspects of TAM biology. Simulations revealed that anti-CD47 enhanced the otherwise weak phagocytic activity, extending the upper tail of the survival curve. -CD49d, which limits monocyte trafficking after irradiation, offered consistent survival benefits across digital twins of mice. Finally, CSF-1R inhibitors, which block the primary growth factor regulating TAM function, resulted in the largest overall survival improvement in silico. Our results aligned well with experimental evidence, suggesting that the model may help inform the optimization of myeloid cell-targeted immunotherapies, including their timing, dosage, and combination with radiation therapy, with potential relevance for improving glioma treatment strategies.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we used the live imaging capabilities of the larval zebrafish host model to assess the role of the v-ATPase complex in macrophage-mediated defense against A. fumigatus in a whole vertebrate animal. For the first time we are able to visualize co-localization of A. fumigatus spores with the key v-ATPase subunit Atp6v1h in macrophages inside of an infected animal. As macrophages only have a low ability to kill spores, this co-localization occurs as early as 1-day post-injection and persists for multiple days. Surprisingly, macrophage spore killing is not further reduced by targeting of atp6v1h with CRISPR/Cas9. Instead, v-ATPase deficiency profoundly impacts macrophage-mediated control of spore swelling, decoupling the macrophage functions of spore killing and inhibition of germination. We also identify a role for the v-ATPase complex in macrophage control of extracellular hyphal growth.

In a greenhouse experiment, plants underwent different herbivory treatments: no damage, low herbivory (two caterpillars, one on each of two leaves), high concentrated herbivory (four caterpillars, two on each of two leaves), and high dispersed herbivory (four caterpillars, each on one of four leaves). We measured extrafloral nectar (EFN), an indirect defense trait, and phenolic production, a direct chemical defense, as well as regrowth capacity (new leaf biomass two months after herbivory) as a tolerance proxy. To distinguish between local and systemic defense induction, we measured resistance-related responses on damaged and undamaged leaves.

Phenolic compounds were not affected by any of the damage treatments. Additionally, wild cotton fully compensated for damage in terms of new leaf biomass under all herbivory treatments, except after high concentrated damage, suggesting higher costs incurred by this type of herbivory. These results highlight the importance of studying plant-induced defenses under varying herbivory conditions and suggest opposing effects on resistance-related (EFN, indirect) versus tolerance-related induced responses, which are known to affect tri-trophic interactions associated with wild cotton.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

This systematic review explores the use of social media data to spatially model Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES), which are non-material benefits provided by ecosystems that support human well-being. Based on a search of 510 scientific articles in Web of Science and Scopus, we carefully selected and analyzed those that focused on spatial modeling of CES using social media data. We aimed to (a) identify the diversity of CES assessed, (b) analyse the social media platforms used as data sources, (c) evaluate the modelling frameworks employed, and (d) summarise the predictor variables included in these models. 2. We found that the most studied CES were those related to physical and psychological experiences (62%; especially recreation) and the main predictor variables were the presence of natural elements (52%), land use and land cover maps, and topographic variables, often weighted by applying distance-based metrics (24%). Twenty-four social media data sources were identified but Flickr was by far the most widely used one (40%). MaxEnt (37%) and Random Forest (16%) were the most commonly used modeling tools. The most commonly used metrics to assess model performance were AUC-ROC, AIC, and R2 values. 3. While the use of social media offers an opportunity to study CES and provide cost-effective and scalable insights, this article discusses some limitations and considerations raised from the literature review to be taken into account when using this type of data. These include the quality and representativeness of social media data, the importance of a clear definition of CES, a proper labeling of social media data, and an appropriate selection of spatial modeling techniques. 4. Future research should address these limitations and considerations by integrating different data sources and refining methodologies to improve the accuracy and applicability of CES models. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current practices and highlights areas for further investigation in the spatial modeling of CES using social media data.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Sound waves from anthropogenic noise can mask animal signals, creating challenges for animal communication. Songbirds have been observed to combat noise pollution by changing their song rate, duration, frequency, or amplitude, with different species employing different strategies. We examined whether Swainson's thrushes (Catharus usulatus) adjust their song structure under different traffic noise regimens using both population level surveys and individual level noise playback experiments. Swainson's thrushes' song frequency varied with background traffic noise levels across the surveyed population, but other song parameters did not. When confronted with realistic levels of experimental traffic noise playback, individual thrushes rapidly changed their song structure, increasing both the duration and the minimum frequency of their songs, before quickly returning towards baseline levels after the noise playback ended. Together, these results suggest that Swainson's thrushes are adjusting their singing to reduce acoustic masking in noisy areas and further indicate that some songbirds might continually assess ambient noise levels and only adjust their signals when necessary.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

This paradigm treats each annotation as an independent fact, disconnected from the broader biological system. However, proteins operate within integrated cellular networks where their functions depend on genomic context and the presence of interacting partners. Here, we develop a genome-scale evaluation framework that assesses whether annotated protein functions could plausibly coexist within a living organism. We formalize three criteria grounded in systems biology principles: completeness (presence of essential functions), coherence (satisfaction of functional dependencies), and consistency (absence of mutually exclusive functions). Applying this framework to bacterial genomes, we evaluated manually curated annotations from six model organisms and computational predictions from six methods. While model organism annotations largely satisfied our constraints - with violations primarily reflecting host-pathogen interactions - all computational prediction methods systematically failed to produce biologically plausible genome-scale annotations. Methods achieved high accuracy for individual proteins yet produced incomplete metabolic pathways, incoherent protein complexes, and taxonomically impossible function combinations. These results reveal a fundamental disconnect between the reductionist annotation model and the systems-level requirements of biological organisms. Current computational methods amplify this disconnect as they are optimized for protein-level accuracy while ignoring genome-scale constraints. Our framework provides quantitative metrics for evaluating biological plausibility and establishes a foundation for developing system-aware annotation approaches. The shift from reductionist to systems-level perspectives will be essential for annotating the rapidly growing collection of sequenced genomes and metagenomes.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

To address these challenges, we introduce TabSyM, a modular generative pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, task-relevant data to improve predictive modeling. TabSyM integrates three key stages: it extends a diffusion-based model (TabDDPM) to generate new omics data, employs a novel task-aware sampling mechanism guided by Bayesian optimization to select the most informative synthetic samples, and uses a Multi-Domain Adversarial Network (MDAN) to align data distributions for cross-cohort generalization.

Operating at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces overwhelmingly dominate and inertial effects are negligible, microswimmers face unique hydrodynamic constraints. According to Purcell Scallop Theorem, time-reversible or reciprocal motions cannot produce net locomotion, necessitating complex, non-reciprocal deformation cycles for effective propulsion. In this study, we couple low Reynolds number hydrodynamics, modeled via the Stokes equation and Oseen tensor, with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to autonomously discover optimal swimming gaits across a range of biologically inspired microswimmer models. Beginning with the classical Najafi-Golestanian three-sphere swimmer, whose cyclical deformation mimics flagellar or ciliary beating, we validate our framework by reproducing established propulsion patterns. We then enhance biological realism by replacing rigid linkers with oscillatory elastic springs and incorporating electrostatic interactions among charged spheres, modeling chemotactic responses and intercellular electrostatic effects observed in microorganisms. Extending beyond linear architectures, we investigate more complex geometries inspired by microbial shapes and locomotion mechanisms, including triangular, plus-like, and cage-like swimmers that emulate bacterial flagella bundling, amoeboid deformation, and cargo encapsulation strategies. Our reinforcement learning approach reveals emergent locomotion strategies reminiscent of natural traveling-wave patterns, phase synchronization, and directional taxis. Remarkably, the cage-like swimmer exhibits nearly triple the displacement of the classical three-sphere model, emphasizing the influence of geometric constraints and structural complexity on swimming efficiency.

L.", "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is highly aggressive with a five-year survival rate of just 13%. Metabolic rewiring in response to oncogenic signals plays a critical role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) survival, tumor growth, and metastasis. These alterations make PDAC tumors dependent on anabolic metabolism for survival, highlighting a unique vulnerability that can be therapeutically exploited. However, during nutrient deprivation, PDAC cells can circumvent this vulnerability by engulfing extracellular fluids to replenish amino acids in a process called, macropinocytosis. This process can be induced downstream of oncogenic KRAS expression, a small GTPase that is almost universally mutated in PDAC patients. The inhibition of macropinocytosis in vivo reduces PDAC tumor growth, emphasizing the importance of this pathway to cancer cell survival. However, the signaling mechanisms that regulate this process remain poorly understood. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric complex that regulates a wide variety of cell signaling pathways, including KRAS, and is commonly dysregulated in human PDAC tumors. Here, we show that acute PP2A activation prevents macropinosome processing leading to cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PP2A posttranslationally regulates the lipid kinase, PIKfyve, a key regulator of macropinosome-lysosome fusion. Finally, we determine that PP2A activating compounds can function synergistically with metabolic inhibitors, supporting a new therapeutic strategy in this aggressive and deadly cancer. Together, our results implicate PP2A as a critical suppressor of PDAC metabolic plasticity and highlight the use of PP2A activating compounds to prevent PDAC nutrient scavenging.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

A key limitation of advanced BC research is the scarcity of in vivo models that accurately reflect invasive disease, with even fewer capturing the complexity of metastasis. To investigate how the cell-of-origin and specific combinations of driver mutations influence in bladder tumorigenesis, we developed and characterized four genetically engineered mouse models of advanced BC by targeting two combinations of tumor suppressor genes (Pten and Trp53, or Pten, Trp53, Rb1, and Rbl1) in basal or suprabasal urothelial cells through intravesical of Cre-adenovirus delivery. Loss of the retinoblastoma family reduced cancer-specific survival and was associated with more differentiated carcinomas. In both genetic backgrounds, luminal-derived tumors developed earlier but showed fewer metastatic events. Histopathological and transcriptomic analyses revealed that these tumors resemble human basal-squamous and stroma-rich subtypes, sharing regulatory networks and activated signaling pathways with human invasive tumors. Notably, tumors lacking retinoblastoma family genes exhibited increased immune infiltration, reinforcing the value of these models for diverse preclinical applications. To overcome detection and latency limitations, we established tumor-derived cell lines and generated syngeneic graft models.

In vivo models that accurately recapitulate the features and spectrum of human pancreatic cancer are paramount to make a dent in this disease as two decades of the standard-of-care have failed to substantially improve survival.

Tumors from this KMC model histologically and molecularly recapitulate heterogeneity seen in human PDAc, with a high rate of metastasis to the liver. Cell lines derived from KMC autochthonous PDAc provide new models for orthotopic primary tumors that reliably metastasize to the liver and lung, providing important new tools to efficiently study the metastatic cascade and aid in the development of new therapeutics addressing metastatic disease.

The gut microbiome, often referred to as our second genome, is important in human health and is the primary point of contact for orally ingested microplastics. To investigate the impact of ingested MPs on the gut microbiome and the metabolome, 8 weeks-old male and female C57/BL6 mice were orally gavaged mixed plastic (5 um) exposure consisting of polystyrene, polyethylene, and the biodegradable/biocompatible plastic, poly- (lactic-co-glycolic acid) twice a week for 4 weeks at 0, 2, or 4 mg/week (n = 8/group).

MPs exposure resulted in significant sex-specific and dose-dependent changes to the gut microbiome composition along with substantial regulation of the predicted metabolic pathways. Untargeted metabolomics in serum showed that a low MPs dose displayed a more prominent effect on key metabolic pathways such as amino acid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and inflammation. Additionally, SCFA-targeted metabolomics showed significant changes in neuroprotective SCFAs levels in both sexes by MPs exposure.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) refers to the pathological changes seen in FTD, characterised by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes and the presence of abnormal protein inclusions. In the case of FTLD with hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP), five pathological subtypes (A, B, C, D, and E) are observed based on the types and distribution of inclusions found in the brain. In all subtypes, there tends to be a large variability in the number of pathological inclusions observed between cases, with limited correlation to clinical manifestations. TDP-43 is an RNA binding protein belonging to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family which along with other hnRNPs modulates multiple aspects of RNA processing. HnRNPs other than TDP-43 have been implicated in several neurological diseases, including ALS, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS and Alzheimer's disease. Multiple hnRNPs have been found in pathological inclusions in specific subtypes of FTLD-TDP, suggesting potential roles in the disease process. The role of the hnRNP network in FTLD disease pathogenesis, however, has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the presence and expression of hnRNP proteins in two pathological subtypes of sporadic FTLD-TDP (A and C) as well as the genetic form FTLD-TDP A C9orf72 using immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis by single-nuclei RNA-sequencing. We found that there was great variability in frequency of TDP-43 pathology across and within FTLD-TDP pathological subtypes. Finally, our findings suggest that distinct global transcriptomic profiles may underlie the different pathological subtypes of FTLD-TDP. The most prominent transcriptomic changes were observed in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, involving multiple hnRNPs across FTLD subtypes compared to controls. Transcriptomic co-expression analysis further revealed that glial clusters were more strongly associated with RNA processing dysfunction and contribute to disease classification.

Here, we evaluated OPM recordings by assessing their test-retest reliability and comparing them to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in a repeated movie viewing paradigm. In 7 frequency bands ({delta}: 0.5-4 Hz, {theta}: 4-8 Hz, : 8-12 Hz, {beta}: 12-28 Hz, {gamma}1: 28-46 Hz, {gamma}2: 55-70 Hz, and HF: 64-116 Hz) we quantified the signal consistency (1) within individuals, (2) across subjects, and (3) across modalities. OPM exhibited widespread reliability, particularly in lower frequency bands; spatial patterns resembled those of fMRI and iEEG in visual and auditory regions. Cross-modal analyses revealed robust OPM-fMRI correspondence, including inverse correlations at low frequencies and positive correlations at higher frequencies, consistent with known relationships between oscillatory power and BOLD responses. Comparisons of signal-to-noise (SNR) estimates further revealed that in some regions, the SNR of cross-modal alignment exceeded within-modality reliability, suggesting that bridging between modalities can sometimes enhance SNR by attenuating reliably shared noise. Our findings demonstrate that OPM consistently captures stimulus-locked neural dynamics that converge with established modalities.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Mitochondria are one of the major regulators of intracellular Ca2+ in the cells, uptaking this ion through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and releasing by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Astrocytes respond to neurotransmitters and other stimuli by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, a process called 2+ signaling. However, it is not clear how mitochondria interact with the neurotransmitter-triggered Ca2+ responses in astrocytes. To explore this mechanisms, we expanded a previous compartmental model of astrocytes developed by our group including the mitochondrial MCU and mPTP mechanisms controlling the Ca2+ response. We simulate glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs, modeled as Poisson processes, that promote the synthesis of IP3 through the PLC pathway. Here, we used a unipolar and a bifurcated-terminal morphology models and, with exception for the distal compartments, every other compartment have mitochondria. Simulations revealed that mitochondria modulate the Ca2+ response in a context-dependent manner. For weak glutamatergic input, they reduce the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations and the distance these signals propagate from the terminal regions. However, for strong glutamatergic input and in the presence of dopamine, mitochondria enhance the Ca2+ response by reducing the Ca2+-dependent IP3 degradation. Our findings provide computational evidence that mitochondria have a critical role in shaping the spatial organization of Ca2+ singling in astrocytes.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

A.; Barrera-Ruilova, G.; Rodriguez-Martinez, E. I.", "abstract": "Intersaccadic times or eye fixation durations (EFD) are relatively stable at around 250ms, equivalent to 4 saccades by second. However, the mean and standard deviation are not sufficient to describe the frequency histogram distribution of EFD. The exgaussian has been proposed for fitting the EFD histograms. Present report tries to adjust a competition model (C model) between the saccadic and the fixation network to the EFD histograms. This model is at a rather conceptual level (computational level in Marr classification). Both models were adjusted to EFD from an open database with data of 179473 eye fixations. The C model showed to be able, along with exgaussian model, to be compatible for explaining the EFD distributions. The two parameters of the C model can be ascribed to (i) a refractory period for new saccades modeled by a sigmoid equation (A parameter), while (ii) the ps parameter would be related to the continuous competition between the saccadic network related to the saliency map and the eye fixation network, and would be modeled through a geometric probability density function. The model suggests that competition between neural networks would be an organizational property of brain neural networks to facilitate the decision process for action and perception. In the visual scene scanning the C model dynamic justifies the early post-saccadic stability of the foveated image, and the subsequent exploration of a broad space in the observed image.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

An intranasally administered, live-attenuated influenza vaccine designed to stimulate mucosal immunity, FluMist, is the sole intranasal vaccine approved in the United States. However, FluMist has lower systemic immunogenicity and efficacy in adults compared to intramuscular formulations. In this study, human mucosal and systemic immunity were examined following seasonal intramuscular or intranasal vaccination. Nasopharyngeal swabs of adenoid tissue were used to longitudinally sample the upper airway. Notably, FluMist induced substantial increases in upper respiratory tract IgG+ and IgA+ HA-specific memory B cells, which displayed an activated CD27+CD21- phenotype. H1, H3, and influenza B virus HA-specific memory B cells were all detected in the upper airway after intranasal immunization and remained elevated at 6-months post-vaccination. Recently activated upper airway memory B cells were not readily detected in intramuscular vaccinees, despite marked elevation of systemic antibody and memory B cells. Thus, despite minimal immune response detected in circulation, live-attenuated influenza vaccine can generate substantial local antigen-specific memory B cell responses in adults.

G1-CD8+T-cells demonstrated baseline ER-Ca2+ depletion followed by sustained increases in cytosolic-Ca2+ upon TCR stimulation. G1-CD8+T-cells were more sensitive to Ca2+ chelation, or store-operated Ca2+ entry inhibition, and relatively resistant to calcineurin antagonism vs. G0-CD8+T-cells.

This can lead to biodiversity loss and impaired ecosystem functions. Enhancing structural complexity (ESC) has been proposed to counteract these effects, but its impact on soil properties remains insufficiently understood. Overall, we hypothesize that ESC enhances soil abiotic properties, their spatial variability, and microbial functioning, with effects modulated by environmental context and increasing over time. Data were collected from 148 patches (50 x 50 m) in eight beech forests across Germany. In half of the patches, structural complexity was enhanced by felling 30% of the basal area of living trees through two spatial patterns- aggregated (one large gap) and distributed (small gaps)- combined with leaving or removing deadwood (stumps, logs, and snags). The other half served as controls, representing typically managed, homogeneous production forests. Soil C:N, C%, and N% increased near deadwood. Soil microbial biomass and activity were significantly affected in three of eight forest sites, with effects ranging from -30% to +62%. Higher soil water content was associated with increased microbial biomass, and greater understorey biomass correlated with a lower microbial respiratory quotient. No temporal trends were observed over five years. Although soil properties showed resistance to structural interventions, site-specific effects underline the importance of soil moisture and the understorey vegetation for microbial functioning. Further research building on our results is needed to develop practical forest management strategies to clarify how structural complexity may support soil functioning and ecosystem resilience.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Despite its growing use, airborne eDNA does not yet have the extensive body of supporting research like its aquatic counterpart, with considerable uncertainty remaining concerning how airborne eDNA behaves, with regards to signal duration, and how much sampling effort is needed to capture DNA in a given airspace. By using airborne eDNA in a semi-controlled environment which acted as an artificial roost where bat species and their abundances were known, we estimated the sampling intensity (both the number of samples and number of sampling events) required to capture bat diversity of a given airspace, as well as signal persistence of airborne eDNA. Together these data provide a temporal scale for airborne eDNA measurements. The majority of species richness was detected using as little as 4 samplers in this enclosed space and the greater the number of sampling events, the fewer samplers were needed. Both air movement and the type of environment (i.e., enclosed space, open area etc.) are likely to impact detection and need to be considered during study design. eDNA also appeared to settle out of the air quickly, suggesting that detections likely reflect recent activity, which also has important implication for rare species which may only have a narrow window for detection.

MRN localizes to chromosomal DSBs and recruits and activates the apical DSB repair protein kinase, ATM, which phosphorylates downstream substrates to elicit cellular DNA damage responses. Pathogenic variants in MRE11 cause the genome instability disorder ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD). The first ATLD patient allele identified, ATLD1, is a nonsense mutation that deletes 76 amino acids from the MRE11 C-terminus and results in markedly reduced levels of MRE11-ATLD1 and the entire MRN complex. This region of the C-terminus has been demonstrated to function in DNA binding, mediate functional protein interactions, and undergo post-translational modifications that regulate MRE11 nucleolytic activities. We previously demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing low wildtype MRN exhibit severe phenotypes, including small body size, anemia, and cellular DNA DSB repair defects. Thus, it is currently unknown whether reduced MRE11-ATLD1 and MRN levels, loss of the C-terminus, or both cause disease-associated phenotypes. In this study, we generated transgenic mouse models that express near endogenous or significantly reduced levels of MRE11-ATLD1 to determine the in vivo importance of the MRE11 C-terminus. We observe that reduced MRE11-ATLD1 expression leads to anemia, bone marrow failure, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and impaired lymphocyte development, similar to mice expressing low wildtype MRE11. In contrast, higher expression of MRE11-ATLD1 results in a subset of moderate phenotypes, indicating that loss of C-terminus has limited impact on MRN functions in vivo. These findings have implications for clinical predictions of ATLD patients harboring pathogenic MRE11 variants that impair MRE11 function and/or impact MRN protein levels.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

However, most patients do not respond and current biomarkers (eg, programmed death ligand (PD-L1), mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)/high microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden) lack predictive accuracy. Ex vivo profiling of patient-derived tumor fragments shows promise as a predictive biomarker but relies on substantial surgical tissue to mitigate intra-specimen heterogeneity. Innovations are needed that address these challenges, particularly where limited tissue is available in core needle biopsies (CNBs). Methods: Live tumor fragments (LTFs) were generated from 59 human tumor resections and 31 CNBs from patients enrolled in observational clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT05478538, NCT05520099, NCT06349642) to assess cytokine induction following ICI treatment. LTFs were encapsulated in hydrogel and cultured ex vivo for up to 72 hours. A sequential treatment strategy that applies control and treatment within the same well was used with response to ICI or CD3/CD28 assessed using a multiplex secretome assay. Viability was assessed using established metabolic assays and dynamic optical coherence microscopy. Results: LTFs maintained viability and retained T cells responsive to stimulation throughout ex vivo culture. Multiplex immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry showed key components of the tumor microenvironment, including relative proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ immune cell populations, were preserved. Specimens positive for PD-L1 or dMMR/MSI-high were enriched for cytokine upregulation, including T-cell response cytokines IFN{gamma} and CXCL10, after PD-1 treatment. To demonstrate clinical applicability of the sequential treatment strategy, CNBs from patients with lung, gastrointestinal or kidney cancer were profiled and differential cytokine induction in response to ICI treatment was observed. Conclusions: The novel ex vivo platform presented is capable of detecting T-cell response to ICI treatment by using a sequential treatment strategy. This approach addresses challenges associated with cross-well heterogeneity in tissue composition and requires half as much tissue as a cross-well comparison, mitigating tissue limitations typically associated with non-surgical biopsies. Importantly, the platform is compatible with established functional assays as well as non-destructive spatial imaging, enabling researchers to characterize response to ICI longitudinally. Ongoing trials will enable clinicians to assess platform performance in predicting response to immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Functionally, mtDNA mutations were associated with reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), as measured by Seahorse analyser. This metabolic vulnerability could be phenocopied by treatment with the complex I inhibitor IACS-10759 in combination with the targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib, which significantly reduced the colony-forming potential of TKI resistant leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs). Strikingly, we show that mtDNA mutations were associated with increased sensitivity to imatinib therapy in the clinic. Patients with [&ge;]3 mutations and patients with mutations in the D-loop showed significantly higher cumulative incidence of major molecular response at 24 months (90% vs. 68%, p = 0.004, and 89% vs 68%, p = 0.004 respectively). Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed enrichment in non-synonymous mtDNA variants in LSPCs from TKI-sensitive patients, while TKI-resistant cells exhibited upregulated gene signatures related to glycerolipid and phospholipid metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis.

Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is an important initiating step in the metastatic cascade that allows cells to acquire the migratory and invasive phenotypes necessary for dissemination. The transcriptional reprogramming that takes place during EMT has been well described in multiple cancer types; however, the posttranslational regulatory mechanisms that govern EMT are poorly understood. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is serine/threonine (ser/thr) phosphatase that accounts for 50% of cellular ser/thr phosphatase activity and is critically important in regulating signaling homeostasis. PP2A dysregulation has been implicated in cell state regulation, EMT, and metastasis, but the roles of individual PP2A complexes are poorly understood. Our data indicate that suppression of the specific PP2A complex, PP2A-B56a, results in decreased expression of epithelial markers and increased expression of mesenchymal markers consistent with EMT. These molecular changes are associated with migratory and invasive phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these migratory phenotypes can be rescued with B56a overexpression. Together, these findings implicate B56a as a key regulator of cellular plasticity and highlight the dynamic nature by which PP2A-B56a posttranslationally regulates NSCLC EMT.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ulceration remain inadequately defined. In this study, we aimed to construct single-cell atlases of ulcerative and non-ulcerative CAS plaques to identify biomarkers associated with ulcerative lesions. Approach and Results: Plaque tissues from four ulcerative and three non-ulcerative CAS samples were collected and subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Cell types were identified through scRNA-seq analysis, and differential cell types were determined by comparing their proportions between the 2 groups. Candidate genes were identified by intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within these differential cell populations. Subsequently, the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plugin in Cytoscape was employed to confirm the biomarkers. Functional annotation and regulatory network analysis were then performed to investigate underlying biological mechanisms. scRNA-seq analysis identified 7 cell types, of which 6 showed differential proportions, leading to the identification of 61 candidate genes and 7 key biomarkers (KLF2, JUNB, FOS, HSPA1A, DUSP1, JUND, and ZFP36). Enrichment analysis indicated that these biomarkers may influence ulcerative CAS plaques via RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription and stress-response pathways. Regulatory network analysis revealed complex interactions, with RBMX, STAT3, YTHDF3, DDX3X, and ELAVL1 identified as potential upstream regulators.

However, conventional MIPD often requires manual simulation and regimen selection, which are time-consuming and demand specialized expertise. Reinforcement learning (RL), in which an agent learns optimal decisions through iterative interactions with an environment, offers a scalable and automated alternative. In this study, we developed a model-informed Deep Q-Network (DQN) to personalize infliximab dosing for patients with Crohn's disease. The DQN was trained in a simulation environment incorporating a population PK model, inter-individual variability, and assay error. Virtual patients with randomly sampled covariates were used to explore dosing strategies at infusions 1, 3, and 4. Doses ranged from 1 to 10 mg/kg at infusion 1 and from 1 to 20 mg/kg thereafter, with intervals of 4 to 12 weeks. The reward function prioritized achieving trough concentrations of 18-26 mcg/mL before infusion 3 and 5-10 mcg/mL before infusions 4 and 5, while penalizing overtreatment and additional infusions. The DQN policy converged after 80,000 episodes, yielding target attainment probabilities (PTAs) of 92.9% and 98.4% at infusions 4 and 5, respectively, in 1,000 virtual patients. High doses (11-20 mg/kg) were selected in only 0.2% of cases. At infusion 4, 66.8% of patients received an 8-week interval, and 57.3% at infusion 5. Retrospective real-world validation showed that patients whose actual doses matched DQN recommendations had trough levels significantly closer to target ranges. These findings support the feasibility of using DQN-based agents to enhance and automate infliximab individualized dosing in pediatric populations.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Deficits in BDNF/TrkB signalling and trafficking have been identified in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at an increased risk of developing AD compared to the general population. Basal forebrain neurons (BFNs) are among the first to degenerate in AD and DS, but the mechanisms underlying their vulnerability remain unclear. Using BFNs derived from the Dp1Tyb mouse model of DS, we investigated neurotrophic signalling and trafficking deficits in AD-DS. We found enlarged early endosomes and elevated levels of active Rab5, a GTPase critical for early endosome formation, in Dp1Tyb BFNs. These abnormalities were associated with impaired transport of internalised TrkB from axon terminals to the soma. Using microfluidic devices, we demonstrated that axonal BDNF stimulation enhanced signalling endosome dynamics in wild-type but not Dp1Tyb BFNs, which is likely due to impaired axonal ERK1/2 signalling. Our findings establish a link between Rab5 hyperactivation, endosomal dysfunction, and impaired ERK1/2 signalling, highlighting the interplay between trafficking and neurotrophic signalling, and underscore the importance of targeting endolysosomal and signalling pathways to mitigate neuronal dysfunction in AD-DS.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Despite advances in proteomic workflows, CSP analysis from cryopreserved or low-input clinical samples remains limited by technical constraints, including reduced membrane integrity, inefficient labeling, and high background. To address these challenges, we optimized and benchmarked two complementary surface enrichment strategies compatible with low-input applications (fewer than 1 million cells) and real-world sample types, including fresh, viably cryopreserved, and dissociated solid tissues. We systematically compared oxidation-based N-glycoprotein capture and WGA-HRP-mediated proximity labeling across a range of input amounts using both solid tumor (A549) and hematologic cancer (KMS-12-BM) cell lines. The N-glycopeptide method yielded superior specificity in low-input contexts, while WGA-HRP captured complementary CSP subsets. Together, the methods identified more than 700 CSPs, with approximately 175 unique identifications per protocol. Both workflows detected dynamic EGFR internalization following EGF stimulation and maintained high reproducibility (Pearson correlation greater than 0.9) between fresh and cryopreserved preparations. To extend these findings to tissue-derived samples, we optimized dissociation protocols for healthy endometrium and applied the N-glycopeptide method to cryopreserved dissociated endometrium from three healthy donors. Enzymatic dissociation enabled accurate CSP profiling from fewer than 1 to 2 million cells. This study provides a systematic comparison of two leading surface proteomics approaches, validates their performance on cryopreserved and low-input specimens, and demonstrates applicability to clinically relevant tissues.

Here, we explore the impact of increased cell density on isopropanol production from the syntrophic coculture of genetically-modified Clostridium acetobutylicum [CACas9 {Delta}hbd (p95ace02_atoB), with deleted 4-C metabolism expressing an acetone-formation pathway on the plasmid] with WT Clostridium ljungdahlii using first a pseudo-perfusion approach followed by perfusion culture. CACas9 {Delta}hbd (p95ace02_atoB) produces acetone without any 4-C metabolites and C. ljungdahlii converts that acetone to isopropanol. To explore the mechanism by which these cultures enable supratheoretical isopropanol yields, we first identified NADH-driven hydrogen conversion in CACas9 {Delta}hbd (p95ace02_atoB) as the thermodynamically-limiting step for acetone and thus isopropanol production. We then demonstrated the ability of C. ljungdahlii to mitigate this issue by eliminating detectable hydrogen accumulation in the coculture. Pseudo-perfusion cocultures showed that high cell densities combined with a high population fraction of C. ljungdahlii enable dramatic increases in isopropanol yields beyond the thermodynamic limitation imposed in CACas9 {Delta}hbd (p95ace02_atoB) monocultures.

Single-cell multi-omics data, particularly those incorporating gene and protein expression, are increasingly commonplace and can lead to more refined characterisation of cell types. A common challenge for biologists is to isolate cells of interest using a minimal number of markers for cytometry experiments. Although several methods exist for marker selection, there is limited guidance on the relative performance of these methods, and a wrapper package that combines multiple methods is lacking. The method that performs best can vary depending on the dataset and it can be challenging for researchers to test multiple methods for a given dataset. To address these issues, we present MiniMarS (Minimal Marker Selection), an R package that serves as a wrapper for 10 different algorithms. It allows users to determine the best-performing algorithm for identifying the optimal number of markers that will delineate cell populations in their dataset. MiniMarS uses pre-annotated cells with protein features from CyTOF or sequencing-based assays such as CITE-seq and Abseq as input. Outputs include 1) the minimum number of protein markers required to identify the annotated cell populations using a range of marker selection algorithms, and 2) a range of metrics to evaluate the performance of each algorithm. MiniMarS effectively differentiated populations across various datasets, including those from human blood, bone marrow, thymus, mouse spleen, and lymph nodes, even after subsampling over 41,000 cells to 2,500 cells. MiniMarS also identified 15 markers from CITE-seq data, which were then used to successfully identify the same 11 cell subsets in a CyTOF dataset (F1 score>0.9). Additionally, we showed that by appropriately combining clusters, MiniMarS improves the F1 score of a rare population identification (<1% of total cells) by 28.7%.

COALA interprets models by identifying optimal counterfactuals across user-defined mutable feature subsets and constraining remaining features to reveal how constraint features determine what interventions are optimal. By analyzing counterfactual profiles of features rather than individual features, COALA reveals holistic patterns. Using synthetic and real datasets, COALA reveals simple and complex model trends and provides more intuitive, multi-feature interventions than SHAP.

This problem aligns with the implications of the No Free Lunch Theorem, stating that the average performance of individual prediction models becomes equivalent across the state space of diverse prediction scenarios. Ensembles of multiple individual genomic prediction models can be a potential alternative approach. The framework of the Diversity Prediction Theorem suggests the potential for a reduction in prediction error with the inclusion of diverse prediction models in the ensemble. We investigated the performance of an ensemble approach that combines multiple genomic prediction models. We demonstrate the results using flowering time traits measured in two maize Nested Association Mapping datasets. For both datasets, the ensemble-based prediction approach achieved the highest prediction accuracy and lowest prediction error across traits. Multiple genomic regions containing key flowering time-related genes were captured by the different genomic prediction models with diverse weights, demonstrating different views of the trait genetic architecture. The combination of such diverse views contributed to the improvement of prediction performance by the ensemble-based approach over the individual prediction models.

However, the high incidence of complex viral diseases termed virosis in all tamarillo-growing regions of the country leads to huge production losses and seriously threatens its cultivation. The lack of effective treatments implies eradication as the only alternative in severe cases. In this work, we characterized the virome of eight tamarillo-growing locations across the Department of Narino (Colombia). By in-depth sequence analysis of RNA libraries, we confirmed the presence of up to four different virus species belonging to the genera Torradovirus, Potyvirus and Polerovirus in symptomatic tamarillo plants. These results represent the first report of torradovirus infection in tamarillo. Additionally, we identified a novel isolate of potato virus Y-Tamarillo (PVY-Tam) in Narino that could have originated in South America by a recent divergence of the PVYN lineage. We propose that length variability in the P3N-PIPO protein, which in the case of PVY-Tam contains two premature stop codons not identified in other PVY isolates, might be involved with host-specific adaptations. Our findings broaden the knowledge of tamarillo virosis in the Andean region, and overall, worldwide, thus offering new possibilities for developing effective diagnostic and control strategies.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

To test this hypothesis, we collected fMRI data from 20 people watching a full-length movie, and developed a 3D branched convolutional neural network to distinguish movie characters from the fMRI signal across distributed sensorimotor regions. The same model distinguished the characters referenced by pronouns, using these same sensorimotor regions, supplemented by the hippocampus, precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortices.

One of the most well studied bNAbs is the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibody, VRC01 and others in its class. A major obstacle to effective cure strategies with bNAbs is viral immune escape. A deeper understanding of escape pathways from VRC01-class antibodies in genetically diverse samples is needed. Using an in vitro viral escape assay where infected CD4+ T cells were cultured in the presence of increasing VRC01 concentrations, complete resistance to VRC01 was detected in Env 246.F3 by day 42. We determined that resistance was due to a mutation at position N276 that resulted in elimination of the glycan-attachment site. As the loss of a glycan at this site is known to increase virus sensitivity to CD4bs antibodies, we explored this finding further. Specifically, we introduced N276D mutation into the 12-virus global Env panel and measured neutralization susceptibility to a panel of CD4bs bNAbs. This N276D mutation increased resistance or sensitivity depending on the Env and bNAb in question, emphasizing a dual role of glycan N276 in VRC01-class bNAb neutralization. The role of this glycan in escape was demonstrated to be dependent on the context of the Env, the bNAb and the glycosylation complexity of the virus due to producer cells.

Most current classification models rely on a two-step pipeline: a detector first locates and crops animals, followed by a classifier that predicts species independently for each crop. While effective, these models still struggle under challenging conditions and ignore temporal context or information from nearby animals available in sequences of camera trap images, whereas human annotators often use it in difficult cases. We propose to leverage self-attention, a core mechanism of Large Language Models and Vision Transformers, to enable the model to learn relationships between crops occurring in similar contexts. Our self-attention module operates directly on the set of crop embeddings, producing new representations enriched with information from other crops, improving species classification. The module fits into the two-step pipeline without requiring structural change and adds only minimal computational overhead. To address the lack of annotated multi-species sequences, we develop a training strategy that synthetically generates multi-species sequences from mono-specific ones. Compared to an independent classifier baseline, our multi-crop model achieves higher accuracy on mono-specific sequences, both real and synthetic. In multi-species settings, evaluated using synthetic test sets, we also observe a substantial improvement in accuracy. Using real but weakly annotated multi-species sequences, we reformulate the task as multi-label set classification, and conduct a visual analysis, to highlight the benefits of our approach. By leveraging the information brought by all detections of animals in the image and others of the same sequence, our approach reduces species misclassifications and enables more accurate estimates for downstream ecological analyses focusing on, for instance, species richness, occupancy, and species interaction.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The intensity of substrate borne vibrations generated by trains on the ground, on the front comb of a hive and on its base as well as the airborne sound pressure were recorded at different distances and sites. Vibrational noise of amplitudes that can be detected by honey bees is present on the ground surface, on the comb and on the base over distances up to 20 m from the railway track and the attenuation of the airborne sounds is higher than the attenuation of the substrate borne vibrations. Bees placed in an observational hive and exposed to simulated substrate borne vibrations caused by a cargo train show significant behavioural reactions. The same substrate borne vibration was presented to bee colonies every 5 minutes continuously for six months at realistic amplitudes. On the colony level no differences are found for capped and open worker brood, worker eggs, adult drone population, capped and open drone brood, brood development, varroa mites, collected pollen and honey production; while some significant differences are present for worker population and pollen collecting foragers. We conclude that honey bee colonies in the vicinity of railroads are exposed to substrate borne vibrational noise above their threshold of sensitivity up to 20 m. At the individual level bees show reactions to the vibrations; however, at the population level bees seem to cope with the disturbance. As higher amplitudes and additional stress factors might affect the colonies, it seems to be anyways advisable to generally avoid placing bee colonies close to anthropogenic vibrational noise sources.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Most nanocarriers rely on passive accumulation or epithelial-specific ligands, limiting their utility in complex, inflamed renal environments. In acute kidney injury (AKI), inflammation and vascular dysfunction play central roles, yet targeting strategies beyond the tubule remain underexplored. Here, dual-ligand micelles are developed to enhance nanocarrier localization to the inflamed kidney by simultaneously engaging both organ- and injury-specific cues. Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene sulfide) (PEG-b-PPS) micelles were engineered to display two peptide ligands: CLPVASC, which preferentially distributes to the kidney, and CYNTTTHRC, which binds selectively to inflamed endothelium. These targeting motifs were incorporated via lipid-anchored peptide amphiphiles, enabling modular surface functionalization without disrupting micelle morphology, size, or charge. In vitro, dual-targeted micelles demonstrated enhanced uptake by human endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation. In vivo, following unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in mice, targeted micelles achieved selective accumulation in the injured kidney, outperforming both non-targeted controls and contralateral kidneys. Off-target distribution to liver, lung, and spleen was markedly reduced, confirming the spatial precision of the dual-ligand approach.

Researchers use a structure called a clonal tree--which depicts ancestral relationships between mutated cell populations--to represent a tumor's evolutionary history. Numerous methods have been developed to reconstruct a clonal tree from tumor sequencing data. To evaluate the accuracy of such tree inference methods, researchers typically use simulated data where the true evolutionary history is known. However, previous research has not thoroughly analyzed the space of clonal trees under different evolutionary models. Such exploration would help to better understand the underlying structure and characteristics of these spaces of trees and would aid in creation of more appropriate simulated datasets. We analyzed four different categories of clonal trees, each with their own set of assumptions. For each category, we designed and implemented enumeration algorithms that provably generate all such clonal trees with a specified number of mutations. We then used our algorithms to generate several datasets and analyzed the generated trees to discover patterns in the data across different assumptions. We also investigated two tree sampling methods to compare their output with our fully enumerated trees and found that one of the methods does a good job of representing the entire space of trees, while the other does quite poorly.

Despite this diversity, certain RBD regions emerge as hotspots contacted by multiple nanobodies, while other interactions are unique to individual binders. Omicron-specific mutations are shown to disrupt or alter several nanobody contacts; in particular, our dynamic correlation analysis pinpoints cases of electrostatic clash (repulsive interactions) caused by residue substitutions in Omicron RBD. These destabilizing interactions correlate with reduced binding stability and help explain why some first-generation nanobodies lose efficacy against Omicron. Collectively, our results establish an integrated all atom MD and covariance analysis workflow that rapidly maps nanobody-RBD interfaces and quantifies how CDR sequence variations modulate binding energetics, insights that are critical for structure guided engineering. By pinpointing both stabilizing networks and mutation induced clash sites, the covariance method delivers a mechanistic blueprint for engineering next generation nanobodies capable of maintaining potency against ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

J.; Nellist, C. F.; Grinberg, N. F.", "abstract": "Plant diseases can cause heavy yield losses in arable crops resulting in major economic losses. Effective early disease recognition is paramount for modern large-scale farming. Since plants can be infected with multiple concurrent pathogens, it is important to be able to distinguish and identify each disease to ensure appropriate treatments can be applied. Hyperspectral imaging is a state-of-the art computer vision approach, which can improve plant disease classification, by capturing a wide range of wavelengths before symptoms become visible to the naked eye. Whilst a lot of work has been done applying the technique to identifying single infections, to our knowledge, it has not been used to analyse multiple concurrent infections. In this study, we investigated three wheat pathogens (yellow rust, mildew and Septoria), cultivating co-occurring infections, resulting in a dataset of 1,447 hyperspectral images of single and double infections on wheat leaves. We used this dataset to train four disease classification algorithms (based on four neural network architectures: Inception and EfficientNet with either a 2D or 3D convolutional layer input). The highest accuracy was achieved by EfficientNet with a 2D convolution input with 81% overall classification accuracy, including an 72% accuracy for detecting a combined infection of yellow rust and mildew. Moreover, we found that hyperspectral signatures of a pathogen depended on whether another pathogen was present, raising interesting questions about co-existence of several pathogens on one plant host. Our work demonstrates that the application of hyperspectral imaging and deep learning is promising for classification of multiple infections in wheat, even with a relatively small training dataset, and opens opportunities for further research in this area.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

M.; Yearsley, J.", "abstract": "Emerging plant diseases threaten crop yields, food security, and the health of both agricultural and natural ecosystems. In fields with multiple plant species, disease management can become more challenging, as different crops can either reduce or increase virus transmission Motivated by empirical evidence that intercropping can limit virus spread, we develop a mathematical model that integrates the epidemiological dynamics of multiple crops and an insect vector. We derive an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, showing how infectivity rates and crop composition together determine whether a disease will persist or die out. We also derive a threshold index to assess the potential for transient outbreaks, even when long-term disease persistence is unlikely. We compare monocultures with intercropped systems and find that intercropping does not always reduce disease risk, where, under some conditions, it can actually enhance virus spread. Finally, we explore how crop diversity may shape the evolution of vector host preferences, potentially altering long-term disease risks. Our multi-host model combines epidemiological and ecological perspectives to evaluate intercropping as a disease management strategy. These results have practical implications for designing intercropping systems that minimise virus transmission while avoiding unintended amplification effects, providing a theoretical foundation for sustainable and effective plant disease control.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Lacrymaria venatrix is a species with a small spindle-shaped trunk, a highly contractile neck that equals the trunk in length at its full extension, and a macronucleus consisting of two nodules; it is mostly similar to L. songi but diverges in the denser ciliature, the closer macronuclear nodules, and the single micronucleus. Phialina famelica has a blunter spindle-shaped trunk with a shallow oral bulge and an elongated macronucleus; it is mostly similar to P. salinarum and P. serranoi, but differs in the freshwater habitat, and by having fewer but denser kineties. Chaenea vermicularis differs from its congenerics by a modest contractility combined with a greater elongation ability, the mucocysts organized into multiple rows forming stripes, and the several hundreds of macronuclear nodules. The 18S rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis supports previous observations of the paraphyly of the genera Lacrymaria and Phialina, that need a deep systematics revision.

Caused by mutations in the SPAST gene encoding spastin, an AAA-ATPase involved in microtubule severing and intracellular organelle function, SPG4 accounts for 40-50% of autosomal dominant HSP cases, yet without effective treatments. Although reduced microtubule acetylation has emerged as a key pathological mechanism, whether and how distinct mutations lead to microtubule deacetylation and subsequent neurodegeneration remains unclear. To address this, we generated isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines with two distinct heterozygous SPAST mutations - SPASTWT/C448Y (missense) and SPASTWT/S245X (truncation). Employing an innovative differentiation protocol, we created human motor cortical organoids enriched in CSMNs, providing a robust platform to study SPG4 pathophysiology. These organoids revealed striking genotype-phenotype distinctions, with mutation-specific variations in CSMN loss, axonal degeneration and neuronal activities, mirroring clinical heterogeneity. Mechanistic studies identified aberrant activation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a major neuronal microtubule deacetylase, as a key driver of SPG4 pathology. This dysregulation was specifically attributed to mutant M1-spastin, the longer isoform of spastin. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 with Tubastatin A restored microtubule acetylation status and mitigated axonal degeneration in both SPAST-mutant organoids, with corresponding improvements in corticospinal tract integrity and gait deficits validated in SPG4-transgenic mice. Collectively, our study establishes isogenic hiPSC-derived motor cortical organoids as a robust human model for corticospinal motor neuron degeneration and identifies HDAC6 hyperactivation as a central pathogenic mechanism and viable therapeutic target in SPG4.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Accurate knowledge of the relative proportions of these tissue classes within the volume of interest is therefore essential for reliable quantification. Commonly used brain segmentation tools differ in their algorithms, priors, and implementation, potentially introducing variability in MRS-derived concentration estimates. This study investigates the impact of segmentation software on estimated absolute concentrations. Methods: Three segmentation software tools, ANTs, FSL, and SPM, were evaluated. Segmentations were applied to an in vivo test-retest MR dataset to assess (1) differences in estimated tissue fractions, and (2) how these differences propagate into tissue-corrected metabolite concentrations. As an additional validity check and biological benchmark of segmentation performance, age-related associations with GM and total creatine (tCr) were examined. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.0001) were observed in tissue fraction estimates between segmentation tools, leading to differences in metabolite concentration estimates of up to 9% under identical acquisition and modeling conditions. Although the strength of the correlation varied between segmentation methods, no statistically significant differences were found. Conclusion: The choice of segmentation methodology contributed substantially to variability in MRS 'absolute' metabolite concentration estimates. These results underscore the need for transparent segmentation reporting to ensure reproducibility and cross-study comparability in MRS research. Quantifying the segmentation-driven variability allows researchers to contextualize cross-study differences, helping determine whether observed effects are methodological or biologically meaningful.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we present Absolute UniFrac (UA), a variant of Weighted UniFrac that uses absolute abundances. Through simulations and a freshwater case study, we show that Absolute UniFrac captures both microbial load and phylogenetic relationships, improving statistical power to detect ecological shifts. However, it is also sensitive to variation in microbial load, especially when abundance changes occur along long branches, potentially amplifying differences.

Here, we characterize the regulation, specificity and functions of the putative substrate receptor Gid11 in budding yeast. We find that upon its expression during the switch of carbon source from glucose to ethanol, Gid11 associates with the core GID complex, likely forming a large ring assembly. Through systematic mutagenesis, we identify a negatively charged pocket on Gid11 that binds substrates carrying N-terminal degrons starting with threonine and define the Thr/N-degron motif. Such Thr/N-degrons are exposed upon co-translational removal of the initiator methionine, while escaping N-terminal acetylation. Finally, we show that during the switch to ethanol, GIDGid11 targets for degradation factors linked to glycolysis, opposing the established role of GID in the degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes during the reverse switch from ethanol to glucose.

ASFV is a large DNA virus with a genome size of 170-190 kilobases (kB) belonging to the family Asfarviridae, genus Asfivirus. CSFV is a single-stranded RNA virus with genome size of approximately 12 kB belonging to the family Flaviviridae, genus Pestivirus. Outbreaks involving either one of these viruses result in similar disease syndromes and significant economic impacts from: (i) high morbidity and mortality events; (ii) control measures which include culling and quarantine; and (iii) export restrictions of swine and pork products. Current detection methods during an outbreak provide minimal genetic information on the circulating virus strains/genotypes that are important for tracing and vaccine considerations. The increasing availability and reduced cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS), allows for the establishment of vital NGS protocols for the rapid identification and complete genetic characterization of outbreak strains during an investigation. NGS data provides a better understanding of viral spread and evolution facilitating the development of novel and effective control measures. In this study, panels of primers spanning the genomes of ASFV and CSFV were independently developed to generate approximately 10kB and 6kB amplicons, respectively. The primer panels consisted of 19 primer pairs for ASFV and 2 primer pairs for CSFV providing whole genome amplification of each pathogen. These primer pools were further optimized for batch pooling and thermocycling conditions, resulting in a total of 5 primer pools/reactions used for ASFV and 2 primer pairs/reactions for CSFV. The ASFV primer panel was tested on viral DNA extracted from blood collected from pigs experimentally infected with ASFV genotype I and genotype II viruses. The CSFV primer panel was tested on 11 different strains of CSFV representing the 3 known CSFV genotypes, and 21 clinical samples collected from pigs experimentally infected with 2 different genotype 1 viruses. ASFV and CSFV amplicons from optimized PCR reactions were subsequently sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform. The targeted protocols for these viruses resulted in an average coverage greater than 1000X for ASFV with 99% of the genome covered, and 10,000X-20,000X for CSFV with 97% to 99% of the genomes covered. The ASFV targeted whole genome sequencing protocol has been optimized for genotype II ASF viruses that have been responsible for the more recent outbreaks outside of Africa. The CSFV targeted whole genome sequencing protocol has universal applications for the detection of all CSFV genotypes. Protocols developed and evaluated here will be essential complementary tools for early pathogen detection and differentiation as well as genetic characterization of these high consequence swine viruses, globally and within the United States, should an outbreak occur.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Using taxidermied specimens placed along roads, we compare roadkill detection in standardized surveys vs. opportunistic conditions that mimic citizen science data collection, in which observers are not asked to focus on roadkill search alongside roads prior to the survey. Results show that detection probability increases with body mass but declines sharply when observers are not explicitly focused on locating roadkill, with informed participants up to 27 times more likely to detect carcasses than uninformed ones. Even large-bodied species, such as red foxes and European badgers, were frequently missed in opportunistic contexts. By applying species-specific detection probabilities and carcass persistence estimates to a regional citizen science roadkill dataset (Faune-AuRA), we reveal that reported carcass counts represent as little as 0.8-5% of estimated collision numbers.

In contrast, melanin-based and structural colouration are still understudied in the context of urbanization. Moreover, much research focused on changes in mean trait expression, while the effect on phenotypic variation, vital from an eco-evolutionary perspective, was rarely studied in this context. 3. Here, we examined urbanization-driven differences in expression and phenotypic variation of carotenoid-based, melanin-based and structural colours of two urban adapters, the great tit (Parus major) and the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus).

We found a consistent decrease in mean carotenoid chroma of great tit breast plumage in more heavily urbanized habitats.

This study aimed to challenge this paradigm by investigating the immediate vascular adaptations in the placental labyrinth zone in response to short-term, diet-induced obesity. The study hypothesised that there would be an initial compensatory hypervascularisation before the onset of systemic metabolic disease. Methods: Female Wistar rats were fed either a standard control diet (CG, n = 9) or an ultra-processed, hypercaloric cafeteria diet (EG, n = 9) for eight weeks to induce obesity. On gestational day 16.5, maternal morphometric and biochemical analyses were performed alongside detailed placental histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry for CD31/-actin, in order to quantify foetal vessel density in the labyrinth zone using ImageJ. Results: The cafeteria diet successfully induced a significant obese phenotype (mean weight gain: 62.73 g in the experimental group (EG) versus 32.26 g in the control group (CG); P < 0.0001), but did not induce significant hyperglycaemia or dyslipidaemia (P > 0.05). Although there were no significant differences in foetal or placental weights, the labyrinth zone of the EG showed a significant increase in foetal vessel density compared to the CG, indicating robust vascular remodelling. Conclusion: Short-term exposure to an 'obesogenic' diet triggers significant compensatory hypervascularisation in the placenta of rats, which is an adaptive response that precedes systemic metabolic dysfunction. This finding contrasts with the hypovascularity observed in chronic obesity. The discrepancy between increased vascular density and foetal growth underscores the importance of evaluating not only the quantity but also the quality and function of blood vessels when assessing placental health in cases of maternal obesity.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

M.; Abo Zanoneh, M.; Mashakbah, F. F. A.; Ahmed, S. M. A.", "abstract": "Accurate and robust molecular diagnostics are critical for improving breast cancer outcomes. Gene expression profiling offers high-dimensional signatures for distinguishing tumor from normal tissue, but traditional classifiers can be sensitive to technical noise and batch effects. We propose a unified framework that benchmarks classical machine learning and deep unsupervised representation learning for breast cancer diagnosis on the GSE10810 microarray cohort. After variance filtering to retain the top 75% most variable probes (13787 genes), we trained logistic regression and random forest classifiers on the filtered data, achieving perfect discrimination (AUC=1.00) under 5 fold cross validation and held out testing. We then evaluated three autoencoder architectures--standard autoencoder (AE), denoising autoencoder (DAE), and variational autoencoder (VAE)--compressed to 50 and 10 latent dimensions. Downstream classifiers on these embeddings also achieved AUC=1.00, demonstrating that unsupervised latent spaces preserve all diagnostic information. Qualitative visualizations via PCA and t SNE confirmed clear tumor/normal separation in both raw and denoised latent spaces. The DAEs denoising capacity suggests resilience to technical variability, while the VAEs probabilistic embedding facilitates uncertainty estimation and data augmentation. Although GSE10810 represents a high-signal, single-institution cohort, our results validate the potential of deep latent models for noise-robust, low dimensional feature extraction. Future work will extend these methods to heterogeneous RNA seq and multi omics datasets, integrate interpretability modules (e.g. SHAP), and explore cross platform generalization. This study lays the groundwork for next generation AI driven diagnostics that combine high accuracy with enhanced robustness and clinical readiness.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the role of NAD metabolism in cardiomyocyte senescence and cardiac function. Aged mice exhibited reduced cardiac NAD levels, impaired NAD biosynthesis and mobilization, and increased consumption, leading to suppressed SIRT1/6 activity and accumulation of senescent cardiomyocytes. This was accompanied by diastolic dysfunction consistent with HFpEF. In senescent AC16 cardiomyocytes, NAD depletion promoted senescence, which was reversed by the NAD precursors nicotinamide riboside (NR) and dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH). In aged mice, two months of NR or NRH treatment improved diastolic function and reduced cardiomyocyte senescence. While NR primarily activated SIRT1 to suppress cell cycle arrest markers, NRH more robustly activated both SIRT1 and SIRT6, enhancing DNA damage repair. Acetylated H2AX, a SIRT6 substrate elevated in aged hearts and senescent cells, was selectively deacetylated by NRH. These findings identify NAD availability as a critical regulator of cardiac senescence and support NAD precursors, particularly NRH, as promising senescence-reducing therapies for treating aging-associated HFpEF.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The screening was based on the ability of the peptides to suppress SecM AP-induced translational stalling in E. coli cells. Various TEPs exhibiting a range of translation-enhancing activities were identified. In vitro translation analysis suggested that the fourth amino acid in the tetrapeptide plays a key role in reducing SecM AP-mediated stalling. Furthermore, we developed a machine learning model using a random forest algorithm to predict TEP activity. The predicted values showed a strong correlation with experimentally measured activities.

S.", "abstract": "Osteoarthritis, a prevalent degenerative joint disease, is characterized by progressive degradation of articular cartilage. The avascular nature of articular cartilage makes it vulnerable to metabolic disruptions under hypoxic conditions. Central to this process is the role of ATP metabolism in chondrocytes, which generally maintains a delicate balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. To investigate the balance between these two mechanisms and their regulation, we developed a comprehensive mathematical model simulating ATP metabolism in chondrocytes. The model incorporates key metabolic regulators, capturing the bistable switching between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation under varying nutrient conditions. Our simulation also accounts for stochastic fluctuations in oxygen and glucose levels, mimicking physiological conditions during mechanical loading, and their impact on articular cartilage dynamics. The results demonstrate that chronic hypoxia induces an irreversible metabolic shift to glycolysis, leading to sustained reductions in ATP levels and progressive ECM loss. Interestingly, the model predicts that physiological stochasticity in oxygen levels, representative of mechanical loading during physical activity, enhances metabolic flexibility and promotes ATP synthesis. When testing therapeutic interventions, we found that while exogenous ECM supplementation provides transient matrix restoration, only approaches targeting metabolic dysfunction - either through enhanced ATP synthesis or controlled suppression of regulatory factors - successfully reverse the pathological glycolytic shift. Our model suggests that optimal therapeutic approaches should combine ATP metabolic modulation with structural support to maintain beneficial nutrient fluctuations. The framework provides a basis for the development of personalized treatment strategies that address both the metabolic and structural aspects of osteoarthritis, offering new possibilities for restoring cartilage homeostasis and preventing disease progression.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Addressing these knowledge gaps is crucial for directing future research efforts and funding effectively, especially given the relevance of meliponiculture in the local economy. Here, we assess the geographic and taxonomic gaps in knowledge for Meliponini in the Amazon basin. We found that there are 27 genera and 239 valid species of native Meliponini in the region, but, among these, 78 species have five or less occurrence points available in open datasets of biodiversity data, while 7 have no available occurrence data. This issue stems from both a lack of collection efforts, especially in areas far from rivers and roads, and insufficient digitization of existing collections. We argue that future research should prioritize resolving taxonomic uncertainties in species complexes that suffer from both geographic and phylogenetic knowledge gaps. Some of these species are also important for meliponiculture, such as Melipona (Michmelia) seminigra and Tetragonisca angustula. Besides, to overcome the large geographical shortfall, both digitization and new collection effort should be employed, including new standardized methods to access the canopy, the largest frontier of biodiversity knowledge in the Amazon.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

While methylotrophic bacteria Methylobacterium spp. are well studied for their symbiotic relationships with the host plants, the ecology and functional roles of methylotrophic yeasts on plants remain poorly understood. In the effort to isolate yeasts from 26 phyllosphere samples, we identified Candida boidinii as the only methylotrophic yeast, while the remaining isolates, categorized into 17 species in 12 genera, lacked this metabolic trait. To obtain insight into the role of methylotrophic yeasts in the phyllosphere, we investigated the interaction of C. boidinii with a plant growth-promoting yeast (PGPY), Papiliotrema laurentii, one of the identified yeast species during isolation. We found that the colonization of P. laurentii was enhanced by the presence of C. boidinii on Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Co-cultivation assays revealed that the cell yield of P. laurentii was enhanced by C. boidinii during cultivation on pectin and that the methanol-utilizing ability and pectin methylesterase (PME) activity of C. boidinii contributed to this enhancement. Stable carbon isotope labeling of pectin methylester groups unambiguously confirmed their assimilation by C. boidinii, but not by P. laurentii. These findings suggest that C. boidinii not only survives in the phyllosphere by utilizing pectin-derived methanol but also contributes to the fitness of other yeast species through metabolic cooperation.

Microbial treatment had the strongest effect on transcription, followed by donor-specific effects. Gene pathways differed markedly in their donor- and microbe-specificity; interferon expression was highly donor-dependent while transcription of epithelial barrier and antibacterial innate immunity genes were predominantly microbially driven.

To address this gap and overcome limitations of current antioxidant therapies, we investigated MEF2A's role in oxidative defense using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and murine models. Adenoviral vectors encoding MEF2A-specific shRNA or mRNA were employed to silence or overexpress MEF2A in HUVECs. For in vivo validation, endothelial-targeted MEF2A knockdown was achieved via AAV1-shRNA delivery in mice fed a high-fat diet. Systemic redox status was assessed by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione homeostasis (GSH/GSSG ratio), NADH/NAD+ balance, mitochondrial membrane potential, and 8-OHdG. Mechanistic insights were derived from immunofluorescence, qPCR, western blotting, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. MEF2A silencing induced redox imbalance, characterized by elevated ROS, reduced GSH/GSSG ratio, and mitochondrial membrane potential collapse. Conversely, MEF2A overexpression synergized with SIRT1 to restore glutathione pools, maintain NAD+ homeostasis, and suppress ROS under oxidative stress. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed direct MEF2A binding to two cis-elements in the SIRT1 promoter, driving transcriptional activation. In vivo, MEF2A-deficient mice exhibited amplified vascular oxidative damage, including elevated DNA damage marker (8-OHdG) and ROS levels.

Nevertheless, some individuals can better cope with these changes and become centenarians. We hypothesize that their blood transcriptome may provide insights into the mechanisms contributing to healthy aging, as well as enable the discovery of candidate therapeutic targets. The Long-Life Family Study (LLFS), which includes participants from families enriched with long-lived individuals, serves as a valuable dataset for achieving these objectives. Methods. To identify transcripts associated with age, we analyzed the association between age at blood draw and 16,284 RNAseq-based blood transcriptomic data from 2,167 LLFS participants with ages ranging from 18 to 107. We used linear mixed-effect models controlling for familial relatedness and adjusted for genetic, socioeconomic, and technical confounders. We validated results in a dataset of 20,884 RNAseq-based blood transcriptomic data from 434 participants of the Integrative Longevity Omics Study, and compared findings to a published reference aging signature. We integrated the results by building a transcriptomic aging clock. We also identified transcripts associated with mortality risk using a Cox-proportional hazard model. Results. We identified 4,227 transcripts increasing and 4,044 transcripts decreasing with age. Age-associated expression patterns were significantly replicated in external datasets, with high correlation (R = 0.78 - 0.94). Enrichment analysis revealed age-related upregulation of inflammatory and senescence-related pathways (e.g., IFN-{gamma} response, TNF-/NF-{kappa}B signaling), and downregulation of MYC and Wnt/{beta}-catenin targets, among others. WGCNA identified co-expression modules reflecting inflammation, immune signaling, and decreased protein synthesis. We also identified 314 transcripts significantly associated with mortality risk and found that pro-survival gene sets included NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and GPCR signaling. A subset of transcripts showed age associations unique to longevity-enriched cohorts and not present in non-longevity populations, implicating IL6-Jak-Stat3, mitotic spindle, and p53 pathways. Finally, transcriptomic age (delta-age) was strongly associated with increased mortality (HR = 1.108, p = 3.33e-18), with significant survival differences between delta-age groups. Conclusions. This study identified robust transcriptomic signatures of aging and mortality in a longevity-enriched population, highlighting key biological pathways such as immune modulation, inflammation, and senescence. Age-associated expression profiles that are unique to long-lived individuals may represent resilience mechanisms distinct from general aging trends.

This equilibrium is highly responsive to changes in DNA topology, allowing cells to regulate TOP2A levels. Using single molecule tracking, we show that MYC accelerates TOP2A diffusion in cells. We explain this phenotype by demonstrating that MYC limits TOP2A self-interaction in vitro, while decreasing the size of TOP2A complexes in cells.

W.; Zaitlen, N.; Border, R.", "abstract": "Gene-environment interaction (G x E) studies hold promise for identifying genetic loci mediating the effects of environmental risk on disease. However, interpretation of G x E effects is often confounded by two fundamental issues: the dependence of interaction estimates on outcome scale and the presence of endogenous treatment effects, in which genetic liability influences environmental exposure. These factors can induce spurious G x E signals--even when genetic and environmental contributions are purely additive on an unobserved scale. In this work, we demonstrate that any monotone convex transformation of an outcome induces sign-consistent G x E effects: the sign of the interaction term aligns with the sign of the corresponding main genetic effect. We further show that endogenous treatment effects, modeled as threshold-based interventions, generate G x E effects with a similar directional signature. Exploiting this property, we propose a simple diagnostic: sign consistency across G x E estimates can identify artifacts driven by outcome scaling or exposure endogeneity. We validate our framework in the UK Biobank using transcriptome-wide interaction studies (TxEWAS) across multiple trait-environment pairs, observing widespread sign consistency in some settings--suggesting confounding by scaling or treatment bias.

Single-cell and pathway-scale enrichment analyses implicate variable antigen processing and presentation as a primary genetic determinant of latent EBV persistence, with gene programs expressed in B cells and antigen-presenting cells.

Experimental limitations compound these gaps. Structural and biophysical studies have mainly relied on truncated lectin domains (LD) that mimic high-affinity states but fail to replicate the full conformational range of full-length FimH (FimHFL). This limitation has restricted understanding of key phenomena, including ligand-triggered conformational shifts and force-induced long-lived interactions, that are central to drug discovery efforts. A model system that fully recapitulates the conformational repertoire of FimH in the absence of its pilin domain represents an important tool with which to decipher allosteric mechanisms and develop effective inhibitors. Our study demonstrates that a single mutation in the LD, L34K, induces the LAS while allowing for ligand-binding induced conformational change to the HAS, mirroring the behavior of FimHFL adhesin. Comparing the conformational states, ligand binding kinetics, dynamics, and catch bond behavior of WT and mutant LD reveals a dynamic allosteric mechanism. We propose this mechanism enables FimH, and the bacteria that express it, to sustain long-lived interactions with mannose under both static and force conditions.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that fibrotic remodeling and biomechanical stiffening of colorectal tissues represent hallmarks and drivers of EO CRC. Using primary human tissues, we show that EO CRC is associated with changes in collagen microstructure, increased stiffness and elevated viscosity of primary tumors. Spatial profiling and immunostaining reveal pro-fibrotic transcriptional programs in stromal cells, alongside enhanced mechanotransduction and proliferation in epithelial cells. In vitro, increased matrix stiffness promotes increased proliferation of epithelial cells in 2D and 3D colorectal cancer models.

Emerging evidence suggests that changes in the oral microbiome can contribute to oral mucositis development, making microbial signatures potential targets for therapeutic interventions. This study aimed to: (1) characterize longitudinal microbial patterns of oral mucositis severity among head and neck cancer patients; (2) determine clinically relevant patient clusters based on oral mucositis severity trajectories; and (3) identify microbial signatures specific to these clusters. Results: We derived a calibrated oral mucositis score by applying non-negative sparse principal component analysis to seven oral mucositis related symptom ratings, using longitudinal microbiome data from 140 head and neck cancer patients. Functional data analysis and hierarchical clustering identified three distinct patient clusters with differing microbial trajectories of oral mucositis progression. One cluster exhibited patients with a rapid increase in oral mucositis severity following treatment initiation, while the other clusters displayed more gradual increase. Demographic comparisons revealed significant differences in age and weight distributions between clusters, with older, lighter patients more common in clusters experiencing more gradual oral mucositis progression. Partial least squares knockoff analysis identified cluster-specific microbial signatures: notably, Prevotella spp. positively associated with calibrated oral mucositis score across all clusters, while Alloprevotella} was significantly enriched only in patients experiencing rapid oral mucositis progression. Conversely, genera associated with oral health, including Haemophilus, Rothia, and Actinomyces, were negatively correlated with calibrated oral mucositis score. Conclusions: Distinct trajectories of oral mucositis scores in head and neck cancer patients are linked to specific oral microbial profiles and demographic factors. The identification of cluster-specific microbial profiles highlights the potential for microbiome-targeted interventions to manage oral mucositis severity. While most taxa were cluster-specific, Prevotella consistently ranked among the top taxa positively associated with the calibrated oral mucositis score across clusters, suggesting it may not differentiate between patient groups but rather reflects overall disease severity.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

The dominant single-protofilament morphology comprises the full-length 133-residue LECT2 protein and retains all three native disulfide bonds. Low-resolution reconstructions of double-protofilament morphologies suggest they adopt a similar fold to the single protofilament morphology, but form paired assemblies with different inter-filament interfaces.

Compared to younger adults, older adults tend to exhibit greater preference for large, delayed over small, immediate rewards (i.e., less delay discounting), which could lead to missed opportunities to obtain resources necessary for quality of life. Intertemporal choice is mediated by the prefrontal cortex, but how this is impacted by advanced age is not well understood. We used optogenetic inactivation to investigate contributions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during distinct components of an intertemporal choice task in young and aged rats. mPFC inactivation during deliberation (during decisions between small, immediate vs. large, delayed rewards) increased preference for large, delayed rewards in both age groups. In contrast, inactivation during delays prior to large reward delivery increased preference for large, delayed rewards only in aged rats. Choices were unaffected by inactivation during other task phases.

We investigated the metacognitive mechanism of working memory (WM) using two-photon calcium imaging in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys, who were trained to memorize spatial sequences of varying difficulties. In some trials, after viewing the sequence, monkeys could opt out of retrieval for a smaller reward, reflecting their confidence in WM (meta-WM). We discovered that PFC neurons encoded WM strength by jointly representing the remembered locations through population coding and their associated uncertainties. This WM strength faithfully predicted the monkeys' recall performance and opt-out decisions. In addition to memory strength, other factors--trial history and arousal--encoded in baseline activity predicted opt-out decisions, serving as cues for meta-WM. We identified a code of meta-WM itself that integrated WM strength and these cues. Importantly, WM strength, cues, and meta-WM were represented in different subspaces within the same PFC population. The dynamics and geometry of PFC activity implement metacognitive computations, integrating WM strength with cues into a meta-WM signal that guides behavior.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

E.; Sachdev, R.; Larkum, M.; Gilad, A.", "abstract": "Learning to link sensory information to motor actions involves dynamic coordination across cortical layers and regions. However, the involvement of a particular layer in learning, especially from a cortex-wide perspective, is relatively unknown. Using wide-field calcium imaging in mice as they learn a whisker-based go/no-go task, we tracked activity in layers 2/3 or 5 (L2/3 or L5) across 25 cortical areas. A surprising initial effect of learning was that activity in L5 but not in L2/3 was globally suppressed at auditory cue onset. As the texture comes into touch, we found that L2/3 displayed learning-related enhancements in higher order association areas rostrolateral (RL) and secondary somatosensory (S2), whereas L5 in these areas oppositely decreased. During texture touch, the barrel cortex (BC) displayed similar learning-related enhancement in both layers. As sensory information is transformed into a motor action, there was a frontal/posterior divergence that emerges after learning, in which L5 was enhanced in the frontal cortex and L2/3 was suppressed in the posterior cortex. In general, learning related correlations were often stronger between distant cortical layers than within the same column, suggesting that learning drives laminar interactions that transcend traditional columnar organization. Together, these results reveal that learning orchestrates a dynamic interplay of activity across space, time and cortical layers. Our findings emphasize the critical role of laminar architecture in shaping cortical plasticity and support the view that layer-specific circuits are fundamental to sensorimotor learning.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Because distinct stress paradigms activate different neuroimmune circuits, it is critical to investigate model-specific effects. We examined how social stress primes the gut for heightened inflammation and whether this is mediated by specific neuroendocrine pathways, including beta-adrenergic (sympathetic) or glucocorticoid/ corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR1) (HPA axis) signaling. Mice were exposed to social disruption (SDR) stress and pre-treated with pharmacological antagonists targeting alpha-adrenergic receptors (idazoxan), beta-adrenergic receptor (B-AR) (propranolol), glucocorticoid receptor (mifepristone), or CRHR1 (antalarmin). Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) gene expression and microbiota composition were assessed following SDR. To determine disease impact, SDR was combined with either Citrobacter rodentium infection or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, with interventions including the {beta}-AR inhibitor propranolol and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. SDR significantly upregulated expression of Dual oxidase 2 (Duox2), Dual oxidase maturation factor 2 (Duoxa2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) in IECs (2- to 8-fold, p < 0.0001), effects reversed by B-AR blockade but not alpha-adrenergic, CRH, or glucocorticoid inhibition. SDR also induced microbial dysbiosis, characterized by reduced alpha-diversity and compositional shifts, which was rescued by propranolol. Stress exacerbated disease severity in both infectious (C. rodentium) and chemically induced (DSS) colitis, amplifying colonic expression of Duox2, Nos2, and Ccl2, especially. Apocynin mitigated stress-induced ROS/RNS production and body weight loss even prior to colitis onset, reduced colonic gene expression of key oxidative enzymes, and alleviated both chemically and infectious colitis severity. These findings provide strong evidence that social stress sensitizes the gut to inflammation through {beta}-adrenergic and NADPH oxidase-driven oxidative stress, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for mitigating stress-exacerbated IBD.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

In this study, we performed in silico structural analyses and identified a putative B. mori LYSMD3 homolog (XP_004933441.1). This protein exhibits high structural similarity in the LysM domain to human LYSMD3, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.559 [A], indicating close structural alignment. RNA-seq analysis of hemocytes isolated from silkworm larvae injected with N-acetylchitohexaose (GN6), a chitin-derived oligosaccharide and known ligand of human LYSMD3, revealed transcriptional activation of innate immune effectors, including antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes such as cecropins. GN6 also induced cecropin transcription in isolated hemocytes in vitro, and western blotting of hemolymph confirmed elevated Cecropin B protein levels. Furthermore, GN6 and chitin significantly improved survival against P. aeruginosa infection, with median effective doses (ED50) values of 0.62 and 0.48 {micro}g/larva, respectively. In contrast, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and shorter oligosaccharides (GN2-GN5) were ineffective.

The cardioviruses exhibit the highest known viral PRF efficiency in nature, with up to 85 % of ribosomes diverted into the -1 frame. This unusual event requires an interaction between the viral 2A protein and a regulatory element in the RNA genome, thus PRF is conditionally activated by 2A accumulation during infection. Here we present the structure of the 2A-RNA complex, revealing a novel pseudoknot architecture and illustrating the mechanism of 2A recognition. By combining single-molecule Forster resonant energy transfer (smFRET) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we demonstrate that the RNA does not pre-exist as a pseudoknot, rather 2A binding induces a striking conformational change from a stem-loop into a pseudoknot. Together, this defines the conformational landscape of a protein-dependent riboswitch, revealing new mechanistic principles that underpin viral gene expression. We suggest that PRF stimulatory elements in other viruses may also be regulated in a similar way, highlighting their potential as targets for new antiviral drugs.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Around Vancouver Island, threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) populations thrive in areas that differ by about 10 deg C. To understand the acclimatory potential of stickleback, fish were exposed to cold (10 deg C), control (15 deg C), or warm (20 deg C) water treatments for 4 weeks. Their acclimation response was tested using the novel tank test (NTT), black-white test (BWT), measuring growth, determining critical thermal maxima (CTmax), and measuring heat shock proteins (HSPs). We found that CTmax differed significantly between treatments, however, the increase in acclimation temperature was not proportional to the increase in CTmax. In the BWT, the average number of crosses and duration that fish spent in the white zone was lower in the cold treatment than the control, while these metrics were higher in the warm treatment. A similar trend was observed in the NTT test, with warm treatment having the highest number of crosses and duration in the top third of the tank, and the cold treatment having the lowest. Surprisingly, fish in the cold treatment had a significantly greater change in weight and lowest HSP content than fish kept in the other treatments, which may be associated with energy expenditure and trade-offs for activity. Given these results, greater trade-offs in fish energy usage are anticipated in changing climates due to the acclimation limits of their bodies which would starkly affect ecosystem dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Genome-wide association studies have provided critical insight into factors that modify the course of disease. These include DNA repair genes that alter the rate of somatic expansion and other genes that do not appear to directly influence this process. One modifier gene is DNA ligase 1 (LIG1), in which a variant specifying a lysine to asparagine substitution (K845N) is associated with a profound (7-8 year) delay in the onset of motor signs. Here, we have taken a multifaceted approach to gain insight into the protective nature of this variant in HD. We demonstrate using in vitro ligase assays and enzyme kinetics that K845N enhances discrimination towards mismatched substrates and increases repair fidelity. Consistent with increased ligation fidelity, K845N confers protection against oxidative stress in cell-based assays. Finally, we demonstrate that the mouse LIG1 K843N orthologue suppresses somatic CAG expansion in HD knock-in mice. Overall, our data provide evidence that altered LIG1 function due to the K845N substitution may contribute to HD clinical delay by slowing somatic expansion in the brain and protecting the genome globally against damage.

Single doses of 14 or 16 Gy were delivered, and normal-tissue injury was quantified by time-to-25% body-weight loss. At 14 Gy, UHDR under K/X produced a marked survival advantage: by day 14, 80% of animals had not reached the weight-loss endpoint versus 40% after CDR K/X; no FLASH benefit was discernible with ISO anesthesia. Raising the dose to 16 Gy accentuated these trends; 40% of UHDR K/X mice were still below the endpoint at study termination, whereas all CDR K/X mice met it by day 7. Again, ISO abolished sparing at both dose rates. To probe mechanism, intraperitoneal oxygen tension was measured with an optical reporter in six mice. ISO anesthesia yielded significantly higher pO2; (62 {+/-} 4 mmHg) than K/X (26 {+/-} 10 mmHg), a 2.5-fold difference.

We address the hypothesis that CRISPR/Cas9-generated PEP-null and PEP-R619W mice have enhanced antiviral immunity over PEP-WT mice during coronavirus infection. Following Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) A59 infection, we interrogated pathology, cytokine production, and cellular responses in the blood, spleen, and liver of PEP-WT, PEP-null, and PEP-R619W mice. Key findings show that PEP-R619W mice have reduced viral titer and weight loss, increased survival, and more mature NK cells in the liver and spleen compared to PEP-WT mice. Interestingly, protection against disease in PEP-null mice was inoculation-dose-dependent, whereas PEP-R619W conferred immunity regardless of infection dose. Further, Rag1-/- PEP-R619W mice had increased survival and reduced viral titer over Rag1-/- PEP-WT mice. PEP-R619W mice also had higher concentrations of IFN{gamma} and enhanced IFN{gamma} production by mature NK cells in the liver at 3 days post-infection. Finally, NK cell depletion elevated PEP-R619W viral titer to similar levels as PEP-WT mice.

Intriguingly, bacterial cells with defective MCP shell due to mutation in individual shell protein showed enhanced susceptibility towards a number of antibiotics in minimal media. The shell protein mutants were unable to form biofilms, produced lower curli expression and were defective in flagellar motility. The shell protein mutant also exhibited lower intramacrophagic viability. Notably, phenotypes were restored upon ectopic expression of corresponding genes. It was evident that mutation in the MCP shell protein downregulated the expression of genes related to pathogenicity. Overall, this study sheds new light on understanding the relationship between EA metabolism and bacterial physiology that would pave the way of developing novel therapeutic interventions against Salmonella.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

However, research on the role of cholesterol homeostasis in hearing physiopathology is still in its infancy. HSD17B7 (17{beta}-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7) converts zymosterone to zymosterol in the process of cholesterol synthesis. Here, we found that Hsd17b7 is highly enriched in sensory hair cells of zebrafish and mice. The deficiency of Hsd17b7 led to reduced cholesterol levels in HEI-OC1 cells and hair cells of zebrafish, resulting in compromised MET and auditory function. A heterozygous nonsense variant, c.544G>T (p.E182*) in HSD17B7 was identified in an individual with bilateral profound hearing loss. mRNA of HSD17B7(p. E182*) failed to rescue the impaired MET and auditory function of hsd17b7 mutants. The mutation of HSD17B7 disrupted its interaction with RER1, leading to altered localization and cholesterol distribution. This provides an explanation for the pathogenic effect of the heterozygous mutation observed in the human case and zebrafish. The current study highlights HSD17B7 as a novel gene linked to sensorineural hearing loss.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Experimental and Simulated Approaches to RoadkillPersistence: Implications for Road MortalityAssessment", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.15.664867", "authors": "Benard, A.; Lengagne, T.", "abstract": "The time during which roadkill remains available for detection following a collision is a central issue in road ecology. Not accounting for roadkill persistence leads to underestimating the actual impact of vehicular traffic on populations. Moreover, disregarding the inconsistent rates of disappearance across species, seasons and roads prevents carcass counts from being comparable both within and across studies. This can lead to a misidentification of roadkill hotspots and species for which road mortality is the highest. However, finding the appropriate experimental method to estimate roadkill persistence is difficult: both placing carcasses on roads to conduct removal trials and periodic monitoring of roadkill already present may fail to accurately describe the underlying distribution in persistence times. In this study, in order to assess the potential for systematic bias in roadkill persistence studies depending on the methodology, we simulate roadkill appearance and removal from the road by fitting a survival distribution based on experimental data. We then explore the discrepancies between methods by analysing empirical persistence data derived from both carcass trials and periodic monitoring. We find that, both in theory and in practice, monitoring tends to produce inflated estimates of roadkill persistence compared to carcass removal trials. Accurately describing the distribution of roadkill persistence times may therefore present a greater challenge than previously anticipated.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

However, their structural stability under physiological conditions remains a major barrier to practical applications. Stability assessment of DNA origami nanostructures has traditionally relied on image-based and empirical approaches, which are time-consuming and difficult to generalize across conditions. To address these limitations, we developed a machine learning approach for DNA origami stability prediction, based on measurable physicochemical parameters. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS) to quantify diffusion coefficients as a proxy for structural integrity, we characterized over 1400 DNA origami samples under varying physiologically relevant variables: temperature, incubation time, MgCl2 concentration, pH, and DNase I concentrations. The predictive performance of the model was confirmed using an independent set of samples under previously untested conditions. This data-driven approach offers a scalable and generalizable framework to guide the design of robust DNA nanostructures for biomedical applications.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

C.; Sadanandam, A.; Kannan, N.", "abstract": "The human mammary epithelium contains a subset of luminal progenitor (LP) cells that are distinct from basal cells in both lineage potential and redox biology. LPs are uniquely equipped to tolerate oxidative stress through glutathione-independent mechanisms and have been implicated as candidate cells of origin in basal-like breast cancers. In this study, we identify the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) cKIT (CD117), as a defining feature of LPs and a key mediator of their expansion. cKIT is developmentally restricted to the LP compartment via Polycomb-mediated epigenetic repression in basal and luminal-committed cells. It is expressed in scattered epithelial cells within both ductal and alveolar regions of resting human mammary glands. Using RTK-engineered MCF10A models, we demonstrate that cKIT ligand/stem cell factor (SCF)-activated wildtype cKIT signaling is sufficient to drive proliferation in the absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and that cKIT is responsive not only to canonical ligands but also to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In primary human LPs, cKIT is rapidly phosphorylated upon exposure to SCF and H2O2, with concomitant AKT activation. These responses are enhanced when cKIT and EGFR signaling are co-engaged, suggesting a cooperative mitogenic program. In mammary gland, phosphorylation of the antioxidant enzyme PRDX1 is selectively detected in LPs, consistent with a floodgate model of redox signaling in which transient oxidative inactivation of peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) facilitates RTK signaling under elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species conditions. Clinically, elevated cKIT expression is associated with shorter progression-free survival in certain basal-like breast cancer, supporting a link between LP-like redox signaling states and aggressive tumor behavior. Together, these findings define a redox-integrated RTK signaling axis centered on cKIT that drives LP expansion and is associated with poor outcomes in a subset of basal breast cancers. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for targeting redox-responsive progenitor populations in both regenerative and oncologic context.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

Previously, we isolated Coniothyrium fuckelii (Strain Con-15H316)-a dematiaceous phytopathogenic fungus-from the ASD samples collected at an altitude of 2000 m over the Noto Peninsula, Japan. While Con-15H316 elicited potent immunological responses in our earlier cytokine-focused studies, its histopathological impact on mammalian lungs remained uncharacterized. Here, we re-evaluated formalin-fixed murine lung tissues from mice intratracheally administered heat-treated ASD (H-ASD: only mineral particles), Con-15H316, and Con-15H316 in combination with H-ASD. H-ASD alone induced macrophage-dominant alveolar granulomas, and Con-15H316 alone triggered peribronchiolitis with eosinophilic infiltration. Strikingly, co-exposure resulted in a qualitatively distinct and synergistically worsened phenotype, featuring neutrophil-rich suppurative alveolar pneumonia, granulomas, and peribronchiolitis. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis revealed marked co-elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CCL2 (C-C motif chemokine 2, also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, MCP-1), suggesting concurrent tissue injury and monocyte-driven immune activation. To elucidate the cellular origin of the CCL2 protein, we reanalyzed two publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets, identifying monocytes and interstitial macrophages as the dominant Ccl2-expressing populations in microbially injured lungs. Although C. fuckelii has been recognized generally as a plant pathogen, this study exhibited the first histological evidence of the potential of this fungus to induce or exacerbate mammalian lung injury, especially in combination with mineral dust. Our findings uncover a novel, non-allergic alveolar injury phenotype associated with microbial-particulate co-exposure, expanding current toxicological paradigms beyond pathologies associated with excessive immune reactions to inhaled particulates and bioaerosols.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

To investigate the relative contributions of malate and aspartate to C4-pathway fluxes in each subtype, we performed 13CO2 pulse and pulse-chase labelling experiments on four C4 grass species: Zea mays and Setaria viridis (NADP-ME), Panicum miliaceum (NAD-ME) and Megathyrsus maximus (PEPCK). Only a proportion (8-50%) of the total malate pool in the leaves is photosynthetically active whereas essentially all of the aspartate pool is photosynthetically active. Estimates of metabolic fluxes indicate that approximately two thirds of the C4 pathway flux is via malate in Z. mays and the remaining third via aspartate, while in S. viridis 50% of the flux is via malate and 50% via aspartate. In P. miliaceum and M. maximus, 91% and 85% of the flux is via aspartate and the remaining 5% and 15% via malate, respectively. The results reveal greater complexity of C4 pathway fluxes than is usually represented in textbook diagrams, and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-radioactive 13CO2 in pulse-chase labelling experiments to study C4 photosynthesis and to detect C4 pathway fluxes in C3 plants engineered to perform C4 photosynthesis.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}

A.; Darrah, P. A.; seder, R.; Freund, N.; Javid, B.", "abstract": "While antibodies have emerged as potential mediators of protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), their mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that immune complexes of Mtb and monoclonal antibodies targeting the Mtb phosphate transporter subunit PstS1 robustly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in human and murine macrophages, leading to enhanced interleukin-1{beta} secretion. Surprisingly, antibody-mediated inflammasome activation occurred independently of cell-surface Fc{gamma} receptors, as confirmed using Fc-domain glycosylation mutant mAbs and macrophages from Fc{gamma} receptor-deficient mice. Crucially, NLRP3 is indispensable for early antibody-mediated protection in vivo, as both pharmacological inhibition, and genetic deletion of NLRP3 completely abolished protective effects of PstS1-specific antibodies in Mtb-infected mice. This mechanism extends beyond monoclonal antibodies, as polyclonal sera from intravenously BCG-immunized rhesus macaques also required NLRP3 for protective efficacy. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Mtb-specific antibodies enhance host defense through inflammasome activation, potentially informing novel approaches for tuberculosis vaccine development.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": ""}
