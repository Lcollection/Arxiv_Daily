K.; Bargfrede, S.; Bohl, K.; Cohen, H.; Mueller, R.-U.; Benzing, T.; Schermer, B.", "abstract": "The JADE protein family (JADE1/2/3) has been implicated in a broad range of cellular functions, including WNT signaling, cell cycle control, regulated cell death, and transcriptional regulation through histone acetyltransferase complexes. All three paralogs share high sequence similarity and contain two PHD zinc finger domains. JADE1 has additionally been associated with cilia-related proteins and genetic disorders affecting kidney architecture and function. Despite their widespread expression, the molecular roles of JADE proteins remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify JADE proteins as regulators of proteasome abundance and activity. Using kidney cells as a model, we demonstrate that loss of any single JADE protein led to a marked upregulation of almost all components of the 26S proteasome. Regulation occurred at the post-translational level and was not the consequence of increased transcription. Consistent with a role for JADE proteins in regulating overall proteasomal abundance, JADE-deficient cells displayed elevated proteasomal activity, while ectopic expression of JADE1, JADE2, or JADE3 reduced proteasomal function. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between JADE1 and multiple proteasomal subunits, supporting a direct role of JADE proteins in modulating proteasome turnover, stability and abundance. These findings reveal a novel function of JADE proteins in proteostasis and suggest that their previously reported cellular roles may, in part, be mediated through regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

AD and amyloidosis are known to impair neuronal function and affect brain neurotrophic factors (NGF and BDNF) expression. Amyloid aggregates and neuro-signaling impairments may also expose AD patients to peripheral nervous system deficits, promoting cardiac disorders. Here, we characterize cardiac physiology, amyloid pathology, neurotrophic factors loss, and the impoverishment of cardiac neuronal fibers in Tg2576-AD mice hearts, human cardiomyocytes in culture, and human AD post-mortem left ventricular (LV) heart tissue. We reveal that Tg2576 animals exhibit increased myocardial fibrosis, amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) deposition, and brain/heart-axis neurotrophic deficiencies, resulting in myocardial denervation and cardiac dysfunction. A{beta} oligomers reduce BDNF expression in both human immortalized and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by disrupting TrkB/CREB signaling.

Readout on a single-cell level can be realized via fluo-rescence-based flow cytometry at the cost of tissue dissociation and loss of spatial information. Complementary, spatial information is accessible via immunofluorescence of fixed samples. Both approaches impede time-dependent studies on the delivery of the vector to the cells.

We apply highly multiplex single-cell chemical genomics to define the molecular response of glioblastoma to EGFRis.

However, the consequences of this interaction are not completely understood. Here we report that co-expression of MRAP2 has multiple effects on the MC4R: it enhances G protein-mediated signaling and simultaneously impairs {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment and, consequently, internalization. In addition, co-expression of MRAP2 leads to an increased number of monomers of MC4R by disrupting receptor oligomers. A structural homology model of the active state MC4R-MRAP2-Gs complex suggests interaction sites between MRAP2 and MC4R that are relevant for receptor activation.

Systematic studies of POE of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are lacking. In this study we use trios among participants in the Framingham Heart Study to examine to what extend POE exists for gene expression of whole blood using whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing. For each gene and the SNPs in cis, we performed eQTL analysis using genotype, paternal, maternal, and joint models, where the genotype model enforces the identical effect sizes on paternal and maternal alleles, and the joint model allows them to have different effect sizes. We compared models using Bayes factors to identify paternal, maternal, and opposing eQTL, where paternal and maternal effects have opposite directions. The resultant variants are collectively called POE eQTL. The highlights of our study include: 1) There are more than 2,000 genes harbor POE eQTL and majority POE eQTL are not in the vicinity of known imprinted genes; 2) Among 180 genes harboring opposing eQTL, 99 harbor exclusively opposing eQTL, and 58 of the 99 are phosphoprotein coding genes, reflecting significant enrichment; 3) Paternal eQTL are enriched with GWAS hits, and genes harboring paternal eQTL are enriched with drug targets. Our study demonstrates the abundance of POE in gene expression, illustrates the complexity of gene expression regulation, and provides a resource that is complementary to existing resources such as GTEx. We revisited two previous POE findings in light of our POE results. A SNP residing in KCNQ1 that is maternally associated with diabetes is a maternal eQTL of CDKN1C, not KCNQ1. A SNP residing in DLK1 that showed paternal polar overdominance for human obesity is a maternal eQTL of MEG3, offering an explanation for the baseline risk of homozygous samples through association between MEG3 expression and obesity.

The expansion mutation in each of these diseases has different pathological consequences and most are currently incurable. If the underlying mechanism of mutation is shared, a strategy that slows repeat expansion in one RED may be applicable to multiple REDs. However, the fact that PMS2, a component of the MutL mismatch repair complex, promotes expansion in some models and protects against it in others, suggests that the expansion mechanisms may differ. We show here using mouse models of two REDs caused by different repeats that the seemingly paradoxical effects of PMS2 do not reflect different expansion mechanisms but rather cell-type and dosage effects in different tissues. This differential effect is recapitulated in mouse embryonic stem cells with inducible PMS2 expression: PMS2 promotes expansion at low concentrations, an effect that requires a functional nuclease domain; while at higher concentrations it protects against expansion. The apparent paradoxical behavior of PMS2 can be resolved in a model based on the different in vitro cleavage preferences of MutL and MutL{gamma}, another MutL complex known to be required for expansion. Our data thus resolve a longstanding puzzle and suggest a common mechanism responsible for REDs. Our data also provide proof of concept that increasing PMS2 levels suppresses repeat expansion not only in cells where its loss promotes expansion, but also in cells that require it for expansion, supporting its potential as a broadly applicable therapeutic strategy.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

We identify a ~3 Mb region strongly associated with sex through complementary SNP genotype and sequence-depth based analyses. Comparative genomics of these proto-sex chromosomes within the species and across the Amaranthus genus demonstrates remarkable variability in their structure and genic content, including numerous polymorphic inversions. No such inversion underlies the extended linkage we observe associated with sex determination.

Unlike other hematopoietic cells, megakaryocytes do not enter the blood circulation intact. They remain anchored within the bone marrow while extending cytoplasmic protrusions called proplatelets through the sinusoidal endothelial barrier. These proplatelets subsequently fragment into functional platelets. This unique process of intravasation facilitates efficient platelet production while maintaining the megakaryocyte cell body within the bone marrow niche, thus preventing potential thrombotic complications. How the extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the delicate balance between megakaryocyte retention and proplatelet extension remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the spatial organization and functional role of ECM components in the megakaryocyte vascular niche. Our findings reveal that laminin and collagen IV form three-dimensional (3D) ECM cages encompassing megakaryocytes and anchor them to the sinusoidal basement membrane. Gene deletion shows the existence of laminin 4 in the ECM cage that is necessary to maintain megakaryocyte-sinusoid interactions. Notably, megakaryocytes actively contribute to the ECM cage assembly; {beta}1/{beta}3 integrin knockout weakens these structures, increasing intravasation and entire megakaryocyte entry into circulation. The retention of megakaryocytes by these 3D ECM cages depends on dynamic remodeling processes. Inhibition of ECM proteolysis results in denser cage formation, increasing the frequence of immature megakaryocytes with impaired demarcation membrane system (DMS) development. Thus, the ECM cage represents a novel concept of an active and dynamic 3D microenvironment that is continuously remodeled and essential for maintaining megakaryocyte perivascular positioning. This specific microarchitecture guides megakaryocyte maturation and intravasation, underscoring the critical role of ECM microarchitecture and dynamics in megakaryocyte function.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

This study demonstrates that RNAi epimutations conferring antifungal drug resistance are transgenerationally inherited in the human fungal pathogen Mucor circinelloides. Our research reveals that RNAi-based antifungal resistance follows a DNA sequence-independent, non-Mendelian inheritance pattern. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are the exclusive determinants of inheritance, transmitting drug resistance independently of other known repressive epigenetic modifications. Unique sRNA signature patterns can be traced through inheritance from parent to progeny, further supporting RNA as an alternative molecule for transmitting information across generations.

A.; Voelschow, J.; Cauvin, A.; Reed, S.; Rubin, E.; Meyer, J.", "abstract": "The decimation of reefs caused by stony coral tissue loss disease prompted the use of a topical amoxicillin treatment to prevent coral mortality. Application of this treatment led to concerns about unintentional impacts such as potential alteration of the coral microbiome and possible spread of antibiotic resistance. We used two different methodologies - microbial RNA sequencing and microbial qPCR array - to assess these concerns and to establish a baseline of antimicrobial resistance genes in coral microbes. RNA sequencing was conducted on coral mucus samples collected before and 24 hours after amoxicillin application on wild Montastraea cavernosa. While diverse antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were expressed, no differences were detected in ARG expression after amoxicillin treatment. Additionally, there were no notable changes in the microbial communities between the before and after samples. Microbial qPCR array was used to assess differences in ARGs over longer timescales in wild Colpophyllia natans, comparing never-treated corals with ones treated a single time seven months prior and with those treated multiple times seven months and more prior. No clinically relevant ARGs represented in the arrays were detected across any samples. A small number of above-detection reads (4 in the never-treated corals, 2 in the once-treated corals, and 0 in the multi-treated corals) may indicate weak amplification of similar environmental (non-anthropogenic) ARGs in the corals. Results indicate that the localized topical application of amoxicillin to prevent mortality of SCTLD-affected corals is neither immediately disrupting the microbiome of treated corals at the colony level nor driving the development of ARGs over immediate or longer-term time scales.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Understanding the factors influencing anthelmintic resistance is crucial to mitigate the threat posed by these parasites. Due to difficulties in studying parasitic worms in the laboratory, the non-parasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is used as a model organism to investigate anthelmintic resistance evolution. However, the suitability of this free-living nematode as a model for parasitic worms is debatable due to its rare androdioecious reproductive system, raising questions about the generalizability of findings from evolutionary experiments in C. elegans to other species. In this study, we developed a polygenic, population genetic model combined with pharmacodynamic approaches to investigate the effects of reproductive strategy and other aspects, such as dominance, mutational effects, the number of loci, and population size, on determining the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary processes. We found that androdioecious populations showed both rapid initial adaptation typical for hermaphrodites and tolerance to high drug concentrations observed in dioecious populations. They also exhibited the highest diversity and shortest time for the fixation of the beneficial allele. These results suggest that androdioecious populations can harness the advantages of both selfing and outcrossing, optimizing their reproductive strategy in response to drug selection.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

All B. napus FT-like genes induce early flowering when expressed at the shoot apical meristems of Arabidopsis thaliana ft mutants, but BnaFT.C6 and non-orthologous FT-like genes do not encode fully functional mobile florigens. In the case of BnFT.C6, the functional change is associated with a T to C amino acid change that is restricted to semi winter accessions. Expression of orthologs of FT is photoperiod-dependent and two distal enhancers are conserved; however, the homeologs BnaFT.A7 and BnaFT.C6 show rearrangements of DNA motifs binding NF-Y/CO and NF-Y transcriptional activator complexes between the promoter and downstream enhancers. Motif rearrangements correlate with differences in tissue-specific expression. Furthermore, homeologs with rearranged motifs could not be trans-activated by B. napus CO in transient assays although they genes show LD photoperiod-dependent expression. We propose that differential diurnal expression of NF-Y genes contributes to the photoperiod-dependent regulation of B. napus FT genes.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

M.; Koelewijn, A.

Neuromusculoskeletal simulations can help to better understand individual aspects of the underlying neural control, but are currently not capable of predicting adaptations to continuous perturbations like split-belt walking. Here, we extend a spinal reflex model with a biologically inspired model of the cerebellum, which enables error-based motor adaptation by modulating spinal control parameters in response to mismatches between internal predictions and actual motor outcomes. In this work, the cerebellum modulates only a single spinal control parameter, the timing of swing initiation in each leg, which allows examining the specific contribution of cerebellar timing control to gait adaptation without confounding effects from changes in other reflex pathways. We created 80 s predictive simulations of the model walking on a split-belt treadmill with a 2:1 belt-speed ratio, and evaluated the results by comparing spatiotemporal parameters and kinematics with literature. The extended model adapted step length asymmetry from an initial asymmetric value toward symmetry or beyond, following an exponential time course similar to that observed in human experiments. The model was capable of adapting at varying rates and converging to different SLA levels, reflecting the inter-individual variability. The modulation of timing alone could drive SLA adaptation, but the modulation of reflex gains may likely be necessary to generate the experimentally observed exponential changes in the spatial domain of human split-belt adaptation. The modular framework can be extended or adapted to test different hypotheses about motor control and adaptations during continuous perturbation tasks.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

This is primarily due to difficulties in constructing kinetic models capable of capturing the complexities of the fermentation conditions. Building on recent advances in kinetic-model-based strain design, we present the rational metabolic engineering of an S. cerevisiae strain designed to overproduce p-coumaric acid (p-CA), an aromatic amino acid with valuable nutritional and therapeutic applications. To this end, we built nine kinetic models of an already engineered p-CA-producing strain by integrating different types of omics data and imposing physiological constraints pertinent to the strain. These nine models contained 268 mass balances involved in 303 reactions across four compartments and could reproduce the dynamic characteristics of the strain in batch fermentation simulations. We used constraint-based metabolic control analysis to generate combinatorial designs of 3 enzyme manipulations that could increase p-CA yield on glucose while ensuring that the resulting engineering strains did not deviate far from the reference phenotype. Among 39 unique designs, 10 proved robust across the phenotypic uncertainty of the models and could reliably increase p-CA yield in nonlinear simulations. We implemented these top 10 designs in a batch fermentation setting using a promoter-swapping strategy for down-regulations and plasmids for up-regulations. Eight out of the ten designs produced higher p-CA titers than the reference strain, with 19-32% increases at the end of fermentation. All eight designs also maintained at least 90% of the reference strain's growth rate, indicating the critical role of the phenotypic constraint.

The network property is defined by the network density and the species of actin-binding proteins. However, the relationship between the network density, the penetration ability of actin-binding proteins into the network, and resulting network dynamics remains elusive. Here, we report an in vitro optogenetic system, named OptoVCA, which induces Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin network assembly on a lipid membrane. By changing the illumination power, duration, and pattern, the OptoVCA flexibly manipulates the density, thickness, and shape of the actin network. Taking these advantages, we examine the effects of the network density on two representative actin-binding proteins, myosin and ADF/cofilin. We find that the penetration of myosin filaments into the network is strictly inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density due to the steric hindrance. Furthermore, penetrated myosin filaments induce directional actin flow when the network has a density gradient. On the other hand, ADF/cofilin penetrates into the network regardless of network density. However, network disassembly is dramatically inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density. Thus, the OptoVCA contributes to understanding cell mechanics by examining the network density-dependent effects on actin-binding proteins.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Changes in gene expression play a critical role in the cellular response to hypoxia, enabling cells to adapt to reduced oxygen availability by regulating metabolism, survival and angiogenesis. These changes are primarily mediated by the HIF family of transcription factors, however other transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, are also activated by hypoxia. Although NF-kappaB is known to be activated under hypoxic conditions the extent to which NF-kappaB contributes to the hypoxic response remains poorly understood. In this study we analysed hypoxia-induced, NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression, to define the NF-kappaB-dependent hypoxic signature. Our analysis reveals that a significant proportion of hypoxia-induced gene expression changes are NF-kappaB dependent, with the majority of genes downregulated by hypoxia requiring NF-kappaB for their repression. We show that, while the NF-kappaB-mediated hypoxic response may vary between cell types, there are a core subset of hypoxia-inducible genes that require NF-kappaB across multiple cell backgrounds. We demonstrate that NF-kappaB is critical for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation under hypoxic conditions. This work highlights that NF-kappaB has a central role in the hypoxia response, regulating a broader set of genes than previously thought, providing new understanding of the regulation of gene expression by hypoxia and NF-kappaB.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

This knowledge gap is partly due to a lack of tools to accurately quantify the behavior of free-flying mosquitoes over extended periods. Here, we introduce BuzzWatch, an open-source, low-cost platform designed to continuously monitor mosquito flight behavior over several weeks with high temporal resolution. BuzzWatch records videos of mosquitoes freely flying in a transparent cage and automates the extraction, analysis, and visualization of behavioral data, including flight trajectories and population-level flight and sugar-feeding statistics. Using BuzzWatch, we quantified the daily rhythms of 10 Aedes aegypti populations from various geographic origins. Globally invasive Ae. aegypti showed increased sugar feeding and flight activity during midday compared to native African populations. Our platform further revealed subtle, long-lasting effects of blood feeding on activity patterns and a complex response to extended daylight periods. By integrating a host-seeking module in BuzzWatch to deliver CO2 and heat pulses, we observed a twofold increase in Ae. aegypti's response to host-associated cues during the daytime compared to nighttime. Combined, these results demonstrate BuzzWatch's potential to investigate responses to host cues over seconds, natural variability in daily rhythms over hours, and phenotypic plasticity over days.

After its introduction into southern Europe, this invasive species has been rapidly spreading as well as causing autochthonous cases of arboviral diseases. Both Ae. albopictus presence and potential to transmit arboviruses are facilitated at warm temperatures, hence global warming is expected to affect their presence in temperate regions. We use a climate- and environmental-driven mechanistic modelling framework to investigate the impact of recent climate change on Ae. albopictus range expansion and its potential to transmit dengue in Western Europe. We simulate climatic suitability, adult density and dengue transmission risk which we compare with a large ensemble of entomological and epidemiological observations over the past 20 years. Most importantly, we analyze a novel spatiotemporal dataset of colonized municipalities in metropolitan France to estimate the spread rate of Ae. albopictus and compare it with model predictions. Lastly, we analyze the sensitivity of entomological and epidemiological risk to changes in temperature, rainfall and human density. Distribution of simulated mosquito populations and dengue transmission risk satisfactorily match entomological and dengue observations for Western Europe (AUC = 0.90 and 0.75 respectively). While lowlands in southern Europe were already climatically suitable for hosting Ae. albopictus around 2010, Western France, together with large populated cities, such as London, Zagreb and Vienna, have become suitable recently. Importantly, the accelerating colonization of Ae. albopictus in France may be approaching the limit of its theoretical climatic niche; future expansion will depend on the climate-driven enlargement of suitable areas. Area at risk of dengue transmission has recently expanded from the Mediterranean coasts over northern Spain and Western France. The sensitivity analysis suggests that climate change may expose medium-sized cities to the highest epidemiological risk; this finding is consistent with recently reported dengue outbreaks in Europe.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Our analysis revealed the fine-grained population genetic history of Denmark and identified distinct coastal and island communities with a history of genetic isolation and bottlenecks. We observed a significant population decline in Jutland compared to Zealand from the late medieval period to the start of early modern period, accompanied by migration from Jutland to Zealand, corresponding to historical evidence. We identified two major haplotype sharing patterns between Denmark and Great Britain: (1) early coast-to-coast connections between South Jutland and eastern England, likely driven by migration, settlement, continuous trade and the movement of people across the North Sea from the Middle Ages through early modern times, and (2) later city-to-city connections such as those between London and Kobenhavn, likely shaped by the reorientation of economic and trading centres in Britain and Denmark, and the increased shipping from early modern times towards the Industrial Revolution. Further comparisons using other North Sea countries showed both shared and unique histories of genetic exchange with Denmark and Britain. Our study provides novel genetic evidence of migration across the North Sea from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution.

Here, we introduce EM-DINO, the first image foundational model pretrained on EM-5M, the largest standardized EM corpus (5 million images) encompassing multiple species, tissues, protocols, and resolutions. EM-DINO\\'s multi-scale embeddings capture rich image features that support multiple applications, including organ-specific pattern recognition, image deduplication, and high quality image restoration. Building on these representations, we developed OmniEM, a U-shaped architecture for unified dense prediction that exceeds task-specific models in both image restoration and segmentation. In restoration benchmarks, OmniEM matches the performance of the EM-specific diffusion model while producing fewer hallucinations that could mislead EM interpretation. It also outperforms previous methods in both generalized mitochondrial segmentation and multi-class organelle segmentation. Furthermore, we demonstrate OmniEM\\'s integrated capability to generate high-resolution segmentations from low-resolution inputs, offering the potential to enable fine-scale subcellular analysis in legacy and high-throughput EM datasets. Together, EM-5M, EM-DINO, OmniEM, and an integrated Napari plugin comprise a comprehensive end-to-end toolkit for standardized EM analysis, advance cellular and subcellular understanding and accelerating the discovery of novel organelle morphologies and disease-related alterations.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

J.; Macdonald, D. W.; Madhlamoto, D.; Chamaille-Jammes, S.; Valeix, M.", "abstract": "Prey abundance and catchability shape the spatial ecology of predators. Predators can select habitats where prey are more abundant to maximize encounter rate with prey, or alternatively, habitats where prey are more catchable to maximize prey capture. These hypotheses are commonly referred to as prey-abundance and prey-catchability hypotheses. Although these hypotheses are often tested at the landscape scale, little is known about how between-patch variations in prey abundance and catchability determine the space use of predators. In particular, in savannah ecosystems, waterholes are hotspots of prey and their selection by predators is classically interpreted as supporting the prey-abundance hypothesis. Here, we investigated whether between-waterhole variations in prey abundance and catchability influence the frequency and duration of lion visits to waterholes, testing the prey-abundance and prey-catchability hypotheses at the resource-patch scale. We combined datasets (1) on lion movements recorded from GPS collars deployed on 20 adult males and 16 adult females between 2002 and 2015, (2) on prey abundance evaluated from long-term, regular monitoring of waterholes and (3) on prey catchability evaluated from remote-sensing satellite imagery of vegetation cover around waterholes in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe). Although lions did not use equally all waterholes in their territory, and there was a high variability in the frequency and duration of visits, surprisingly, between-waterholes variations in prey abundance and catchability only slightly explained these variations in frequency -- and even less in duration -- of lion visits to waterholes. We discuss the ecological mechanisms and the limits of our work that may explain these findings. First, lions and their prey are involved in a 'shell-game' that leads them to adopt unpredictable movement strategies. Second, lions have only access to a limited number of waterholes to spread out their hunting effort. Lastly, lions visit waterholes not only to hunt but also to interact with social mates and competitors. This work challenges the implicit assumption that all waterholes are the same from a lion's view and calls for further studies investigating the drivers of the variability in lion visits at the resource-patch scale.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Motor deficits are common symptoms of AD, emerging early in the disease, and are correlated with AD neuropathology and cognitive symptoms. This study evaluated heterozygous and homozygous McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats and their wildtype littermates for spontaneous alternation and locomotion in the T and Y mazes, and motor behaviour on an accelerating rotarod. Because rats often jumped off the rotarod, the maximum latency to fall across trials was examined. We found no genotype or sex effects in spontaneous alternation in either maze, nor a significant correlation of spontaneous alternation behaviour between the mazes. Female rats travelled greater distances than male rats in both mazes. While there was no genotype effect in the T maze on distance travelled, in the Y maze the hemizygous rats travelled shorter distances than the wildtype rats, while the homozygous rats travelled greater distances. There was a significant correlation between the distances travelled in each maze. Both heterozygous and homozygous rats performed worse than their wildtype littermates on the rotarod, while heavier rats performed worse than lighter rats, and female rats performed worse than male rats once their differences in weights were accounted for. These findings support the continued use of these rats as a model of AD and highlight the need to consider the possible confounding effect motor impairments have on other behavioural tests.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

While platelet lysates have shown neuroprotective activity in preclinical models, the neurogenic potential of platelet concentrate-derived extracellular vesicles (pEVs) remains underexplored. Here, we evaluated the effects of human pEVs and a neuroprotective heat-treated human platelet lysate (HPPL) on adult hippocampal neurogenesis using both an ex vivo neurosphere assay and an in vivo intranasal administration model. pEVs selectively enhanced dentate gyrus (DG)-derived neurosphere growth, even in the absence of exogenous growth factors, and were internalized by neural precursors. In vivo, short-term pEV delivery increased EdU proliferating cells in the DG, while long-term administration (28 days) elevated the proportion of newborn mature neurons. By contrast, HPPL primarily promoted early neurogenesis by expanding immature DCX neurons. Quantitative proteomics of DG tissue after pEV treatment revealed 111 differentially expressed proteins, with enrichment in pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, Notch4 signaling, myelination, and MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation. Downregulated proteins included cytoskeletal and translation-related regulators, suggesting a shift toward neuronal differentiation and circuit integration. Biophysical characterization confirmed the purity and vesicular nature of pEVs, with a defined protein cargo including immune modulators and ECM-interacting molecules such as CD44, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1), and complement proteins. These findings identify allogeneic pEVs as multifunctional agents that modulate neural precursor cell fate and brain tissue remodeling through coordinated metabolic and immunoregulatory mechanisms.

Participants encoded and retrieved spatial locations using either landmarks alone (landmark condition), visual self-motion cues alone (i.e., optic flow; self-motion condition), or both cues together (combination condition). Participants behaviorally benefited from cue integration. fMRI analyses revealed a cue integration effect in the hippocampus, which displayed positional coding only in the combination condition, and only in participants who showed behavioral benefits from cue integration. Furthermore, hippocampal positional coding was more strongly associated with actual than self-reported locations, indicating it integrates sensory-perceptual inputs from spatial cues.

H.; Diep, C. H.; Spartz, A.; Ostrander, J. H.; Lange, C. A.", "abstract": "Exposure to progesterone is a recognized risk factor for breast cancer, and PGR polymorphisms are associated with various malignancies. Two progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms, full length PR-B and truncated PR-A, are expressed from the PGR gene in breast tissue and play crucial roles in normal physiology and breast cancer progression. An imbalance in the expression ratio of these isoforms, favoring increased levels of PR-A, is common in breast cancer and is associated with resistance to tamoxifen in luminal A-type tumors. Notably, PRs have recently been implicated in promoting endocrine resistance and driving the expansion of cancer stem-like cell (CSC) populations. Despite this insight, the isoform-specific molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying PR action in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers remain understudied. Phenotypic studies of T47D cell lines that express exclusively PR-A or PR-B showed that PR isoforms regulate divergent cell fates. PR-B-expressing cells have a higher proliferation rate, while PR-A-expressing cells produce more mammospheres. We profiled progesterone-driven gene expression in cells grown in both adherent (2D) and mammosphere (3D) growth conditions and found differential gene regulation by PR-A and PR-B that is consistent with the observed divergent phenotypes. Only the PR-A-driven gene signature of ER+ breast cancer cells maintained as non-adherent mammospheres robustly predicted poor clinical outcome in the METABRIC data set. We then performed CUT&RUN to identify the genomic binding patterns unique to each PR isoform and their suite of target genes. Our findings indicate that PR-A acts as a regulator of the cell cycle, while PR-B plays a pivotal role in metabolism and intracellular signaling. Our genomic profiling of PRs in this model system has unveiled novel isoform-specific functions of PR. This work has shifted our prior understanding of the role of PRs in gene regulation, offering potential insights for therapeutic interventions in ER+ breast cancer.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

The Hyrcanian Forests of Iran, a unique 850 km stretch of deciduous forest along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, are renowned for their exceptional biodiversity, high levels of endemism and ecological integrity. The northern part of this forest massif is part of the Caucasian Biodiversity Hotspot, while its southern fringe extends into the Iranian-Anatolian Hotspot. The recognition of these forests as a UNESCO World Heritage Site has focused global attention on their protection, primarily from human disturbance. While the diversity of vascular plants is well documented, other groups, such as soil-dwelling arthropods, remain underexplored. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting inventories in different sections of the Hyrcanian forests, with a focus on Collembola, a potentially diverse but understudied group of soil fauna. The study was conducted to answer the following questions: Is the naturalness and degree of conservation of these forests reflected in the biodiversity of springtail communities? To what extent does the composition and diversity of these communities vary between different sites and micro-habitats within these forests? Methods. To answer these questions, 89 samples were collected over a two-year period from three different forest sites that had undergone contrasting forest management. Specifically, the study focused on three forest ecosystems, a preserved anthropized (planted) forest (PAF), a preserved natural forest (PNF) and a non-preserved natural forest (NPF), all located in the Bula protected area. Three types of microhabitats were sampled at each site, including moss, litter and dead wood. The springtails collected were identified and counted (approximately 3,000 individuals in total), allowing various biodiversity indices to be calculated for the communities as a whole, as well as by site and microhabitat. Soil samples were also analysed to compare soil properties between the three sites. Results. The results reveal an impressive diversity of springtails, with 73 morphospecies identified, belonging to 39 genera and 12 families. Of these, 49 could be identified to species level. The estimated total species richness ranged from 80 to 110 species. The analyses also revealed significant differences in species richness between sites, with two preserved sites (PAF and PNF) having a greater number of species compared to the non-preserved site (NPF), and in habitats, with greater diversity observed in dead wood, followed by soil and then mosses. A more detailed analysis of the communities showed a high degree of interspecific diversity in terms of abundance and distribution, without revealing strong patterns of ecological specialization for the majority of species. An analysis of cooccurrences showed that, in most cases species interactions appeared to be neutral. However, some pairs of species showed positive associations, while negative interactions were more marginal. The results of the soil properties showed no differences between the sites and no effect on the Collembola community. Discussion. The Bula Forest host particularly diverse Collembola communities. The results underline the importance of conserving these environments, which harbours a high diversity of springtails. Additionally, the results highlight the crucial role of dead wood as a substrate in supporting this biodiversity. The results also call for a more in-depth investigation of the factors influencing the presence, absence and abundance of species, as well as an exploration of the underlying causes of positive or negative species covariation.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Additionally, NSCs are under investigation in on-going clinical trials for treatment of various human neurological disorders.

However, the current methods for generating NSCs typically include a phase of neural rosette formation and subsequent manual isolation of these tiny structures. As this is a laborious process characterized by operator-dependent variability and scalability challenges, there is a pressing need to develop optimized and scalable protocols to obtain pure NSC populations. In this study, we present a new method for generating highly pure and expandable dorsal forebrain FOXG1+OTX2+TLE4+SOX5+ neural rosette stem cell (NRSC) lines without the necessity for manual isolation of rosette structures. Our findings demonstrate the reproducibility of this protocol through the characterization of different NRSC lines over multiple passages, highlighting the robustness of the process. These NRSCs can be expanded for at least 12 passages without compromising their rosette-formation capacity or their initial dorsal forebrain identity. Furthermore, we show the differentiation capacity of these NRSCs to generate pure populations of TUBB3+ neurons, and under specific conditions, their ability to differentiate into early glial progenitor cells including GFAP+ astrocytes and O4+ oligodendrocytes.

Methods Cell survival, tissue response, and developmental toxicity were assessed across three biological models. In vitro, human fibroblasts (MRC5-hTERT) were used to generate post-irradiation survival curves. Ex vivo, precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from mice were analyzed for radiation-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. In vivo, zebrafish embryos were used to evaluate developmental toxicity through body length and spinal curvature measurements. VHEE irradiations were performed at 50 MeV using the Salle Jaune LPA (Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee, France), while CIEE exposures were performed with a 7 MeV conventional LINAC (Institut Curie, France). Results In vitro MRC5-hTERT cells showed no significant difference in radiosensitivity between VHEE and CIEE, with comparable D10 values (p-value = 0.7). In the ex vivo model, both beams induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell division with no significant inter-beam differences at any dose level (p-value > 0.99). In vivo, zebrafish embryos exhibited dose-dependent body shortening and increased spinal curvature following both VHEE and CIEE exposure. No significant differences were observed between the two modalities at matched doses for any measured metric (p-values [&ge;] 0.5).

A complementary set of works draws on the theory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be categorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class.

Spectral library search and library-free search are the two major approaches for DIA data analysis. The spectral library search requires high-quality spectral libraries derived from the search results of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments, while library-free approaches rely on prediction models to generate in silico libraries. Both methodologies constrain the search space to the peptide list in the database, limiting the discovery of variant peptides arising from genetic variations or mutations. We present a novel computational method DIAVariant designed to identify peptide sequence variants directly and solely from complex DIA spectra while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate. Our experimental results demonstrate that DIAVariant successfully identifies sequence variants previously detected through proteogenomic approaches, while maintaining high specificity across multiple datasets. When integrated with existing DIA database search solutions, our approach constitutes a comprehensive analytical workflow capable of identifying peptides both represented within reference protein databases and those arising from sequence variations not captured in standard databases.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

SNR for OPMs was increased by up to 205% compared to EEG and by up to 40% compared to conventional MEG. Likewise, the signal coherence across trials of OPMs was increased by up to 61% compared to EEG and by up to 23% compared to conventional MEG.

MIBRAIN leverages self-supervised learning to derive generalized neural prototypes and supports group-level analysis of brain-region interactions and inter-subject neural synchrony. To validate our framework, we recorded stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) signals from a cohort of individuals performing Mandarin syllable articulation.

J.; Zhang, C.; Worth, M.; Liu, Y.; Meshram, D.

We and others have shown that activation of the Hedgehog and TGF-beta signalling pathways is required to initiate tail regeneration. In this study we initially focus on these two pathways to better understand their role regeneration. We have found that Hedgehog signalling acts upstream of the TGF-beta pathway by activating transcription of the TGF-beta ligand tgfb1a. We have identified differentially expressed genes that are regulated after tail excision as well as those that are dependent upon TGF-beta signalling. From this analysis we found that Keratin genes fall into categories of co-expression: one set that is upregulated by TGF-beta signalling after injury (krtup) and a second set that is downregulated (krtdown). To see whether these two sets show co-expression more broadly, we analysed single cell RNA sequencing data and found that krts fall into the same categories during zebrafish development. We have mapped the expression of a representative member of krtup (krt97) and krtdown (krt5) sets during development and regeneration and show that krt97 is found in epithelia that is moving and krt5 is expressed in epithelia that is stationary. Based upon our results we propose that the krtup set allows for collective epithelial migration while the krtdown set inhibits mobility. These results reveal one mechanism by which TGF-beta may initiate regeneration and could help to explain how changes in cytoskeletal composition influence cell movement during development and repair.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

While resource consumption in simple systems is well understood in theory, connecting mathematical models with empirical observations in more complex environments remains difficult. To address this, we measure bacterial growth across various concentrations of a complex growth medium and analyse the data with the assumption that populations consume resources at a constant rate. This approach highlights cumulative population gain as a key observable, revealing otherwise hidden resource dynamics. We show that using cumulative population gain allows machine learning algorithms to predict growth rates more accurately than instantaneous population size, supporting the constant-rate resource consumption model. However, black-box machine learning says very little explicitly about the actual growth laws. To overcome this, we apply symbolic regression in a biologically informed way to reveal that additive and multiplicative models based on a Monod dynamics provide the best balance between data fit, model parsimony, and biological relevance. Our study demonstrates how combining theoretical knowledge with symbolic regression can advance the understanding of microbial growth, bridging the gap between mathematical modelling and empirical research in microbial ecology.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Therefore, we developed an easily reproducible chamber system for continuous measurements of whole-plant net CO2 fluxes. We present the obtained dynamics of net CO2 fluxes of several C3 and CAM species, including germinating Quercus robur, over several days, as well as the whole-plant net CO2 flux temperature response of Q. robur seedlings, identifying the temperature thresholds at which they shift from a net CO2 sink to source. We show distinct diel patterns of net CO2 fluxes in C3 plants, likely driven by changes in source and sink activities at the whole-plant level in woody C3 plants. These patterns appear temperature-driven, suggesting a dynamic response of plant's sink and source activity to environmental drivers.

Basic neuroscience studies in animals support the view that the thalamus can regulate the activity within and across the prefrontal cortex. However, it is unknown if it can modify value-based decision making in humans. Understanding this is clinically important because disorders of value-based decision making underpin common motivational syndromes of apathy and impulsivity. Neuromodulation of the thalamus is routinely performed for motor symptoms and therefore could be a viable future target for these neuropsychiatric complications of neurodegenerative disease. Here, a group of patients (n=37) undergoing MR guided focused ultrasound for essential tremor, were tested using the restless bandit, a reward reinforcement learning task, immediately before and after thalamotomy. Performance was compared to a group of age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 32). Thalamotomy significantly impaired the proportion of switch choices during the task (P<0.001) without affecting overall performance. Importantly, this reduction in choice flexibility could not be attributed to diminished attention, as thalamotomy did not affect response time, accuracy, or lateralisation. A reinforcement learning model fitted to the patients' choices replicated the effect of thalamotomy when the model increased exploitation of the bandits' learnt value estimate. This shift in the explore-exploit trade-off, manifesting as reduced choice flexibility, co-varied with the extent of post-operative oedema extension into mediodorsal nucleus (R= 0.64, p<0.001), but no other, including the Ventral intermediate nucleus, targeted clinically during MRgFUS thalamotomy for tremor control. Furthermore, using a normative functional connectome, resting-state fMRI connectivity between the volume of oedema encroaching the mediodorsal nucleus and the prefrontal cortex, predicted individual patients change in bandit performance. Lastly, we used probabilistic tractography to confirm a thalamo-cortical circuit between the lateral portion of mediodorsal nucleus and the frontal polar cortex, which regulates decision flexibility and accounts for the thalamotomy induced behavioural effect observed in the restless bandit task. These findings confirm a causal role of the thalamus and specifically the mediodorsal nucleus, in regulating the extent to which value estimates are used to guide decisions and learning from reward. Neuromodulation of this target would be worthy of further investigation in patients with diminished motivation characteristic of apathy in conditions including Parkinson's disease.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

While they are primarily known for their role in cell cycle progression, E2Fs also play broader roles in cellular physiology, including the maintenance of exocrine tissue homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanisms that render exocrine cells particularly sensitive to E2F deregulation remain poorly understood. The Drosophila larval salivary gland (SG), like its mammalian counterpart, is an exocrine tissue that produces large quantities of \"glue proteins\" in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we show that E2F activity is important for the exocrine function of the Drosophila SG. The loss of de2f1b, an alternatively spliced isoform of DrosophilaE2F1, leads to elevated DNA damage and accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA (cytoDNA) in the SGs. Surprisingly, we found that  IRE1, a key sensor of the unfolded protein response, is required not only for ER homeostasis but also for preventing cytoDNA accumulation in the SG. Importantly, we found evidence demonstrating that IRE1 activity is attenuated in de2f1b-deficient SGs, contributing to both ER dysfunction and cytoDNA accumulation. Together, these findings reveal an unanticipated link between ER homeostasis and cytoDNA processing and offer mechanistic insight into why exocrine tissues are particularly vulnerable to E2F deregulation.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

A.; Broman, E.; Posselt, M.", "abstract": "The Baltic Sea receives petroleum hydrocarbons from various point sources. The degradation of these contaminants in the environment is typically facilitated by a variety of microorganisms that possess a range of genes and metabolic functions related to the degradation of various hydrocarbon substrates. However, our understanding of natural attenuation and the microbial capacity to degrade these contaminants within the Baltic Sea ecosystem remains limited. In this study, we compiled metagenomes from the benthic and pelagic ecosystems across the Baltic Sea to identify microorganisms and characterize their genes and metabolic functions involved in the degradation of hydrocarbon compounds. Known hydrocarbon-degrading phyla, i.e., Pseudomonadota, Myxococcota A, Actinomycetota, and Desulfobacterota, were identified within the Baltic Sea metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Notably, 80% of the MAGs exhibited multiple hydrocarbon degradation gene annotations (>10 reads per kilobase million). Aerobic degradation was the predominant pathway for hydrocarbon degradation across environmental samples. Hydrocarbon degradation gene abundances varied among samples and Baltic Sea subbasins, with long-chain alkanes and dibenzothiophene compounds being the preferred substrates. Species richness and diversity of both benthic and pelagic microorganisms positively correlated with hydrocarbon degradation gene diversity, with the pelagic ecosystem exhibiting significantly higher richness and diversity compared to the benthic ecosystem. Additionally, the composition of the hydrocarbon degradation genes across the Baltic Sea subbasins was influenced by oil spill history, with areas that experienced higher spill volumes showing lower microbial diversity, suggesting potential enrichment of specific hydrocarbon degraders. Among the environmental factors assessed, depth played a significant role in shaping the composition of genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation within the Baltic Sea. Using metagenomics, we profiled the native microorganisms associated with hydrocarbon degradation in the Baltic Sea. This knowledge will aid in understanding the natural capacities of microbial communities, potentially linked to the natural attenuation of hydrocarbon pollutants in the area. Insights into microbial degradation potential can enhance predictions of petroleum pollutant persistence and accumulation, support mitigation strategies for marine pollution, and reveal the ecological resilience of native microbial communities in marine ecosystems.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Background Vector-borne diseases, being major public health concerns, are either slated for elimination or projected for control in Nepal. One of the major challenges in controlling these VBDs is to halt their emergence and expansion in diverse geo-ecological and climatic regions. In this study, we collected vectors of major VBDs to understand their distribution, diversity, and association with ecological variances. Methodology/Principal findings A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect the vectors in five districts situated at altitudes of up to 98 - 1,274 meters in Koshi Province, Eastern Nepal, representing three distinct geo-ecological and climatic regions: mountain, hills and lowlands during May and June 2023. Adult vectors were captured using CDC miniature light traps, BG sentinel traps, and manual aspirators. Association of vectors abundance in function of the geo-ecological and climatic variables was assessed in two vector species (Culex quinquefasciatus and Phlebotomus argentipes). We found the malaria vector Anopheles annularis, the lymphatic filariasis vector Cu. quinquefasciatus and visceral leishmaniasis vector Ph. argentipes from all three geo-ecological regions. The other vectors of the malaria parasite, An. pseudowillmori and An. willmori, and Japanese encephalitis vector Cu. tritaeniorhynchus were recorded from hilly districts only. Mean temperature and rainfall had positive effect on Cu. quinquefasciatus density and deleterious on Ph. argentipes. Culex quinquefasciatus and Ph. argentipes were captured in high abundance per household in hills (IRR = 1.23 and IRR = 13.00, respectively) and mountain (IRR = 1.96 and IRR = 4.00, respectively) as compared to lowland.    Conclusion Two major vectors, Cu. quinquefasciatus and Ph. argentipes were indiscriminately present in all geo-ecological regions. Climatic variables favour vectors survival, distribution and growth in diverse altitudes, including areas previously impervious to the vectors and VBDs. Our findings alert the VBD control program and suggest regular monitoring, strengthening the existing surveillance system and evidence-based planning and implementation of vector control interventions in wider geo-ecological regions to prevent the disease transmission.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Some models of visual system function propose that scene information is extracted from low-spatial frequency components and rapidly propagates through the visual processing hierarchy. This contextual information may help bias perceptual inferences toward objects that are likely to appear within a scene, enacted via top-down feedback carrying predictions. We tested this hypothesised influence of low spatial frequency information through newly learnt predictive object-scene associations. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data from 40 participants who viewed high-spatial frequency objects embedded in either low- or high-spatial frequency scenes. Object-scene pairings were probabilistically manipulated such that certain objects more frequently appeared in certain scenes. We trained classifiers on EEG data from object-only trials and tested them on object plus scene trials. We did not observe differences in classification accuracy across expected and unexpected objects for both low- and high-spatial frequency scenes, nor any interaction between spatial frequency and expectation. However, we observed expectation effects on event-related potentials. These effects arose at similar latencies for both low- and high-spatial frequency scenes.

Indeed, a link between plasticity and heterozygosity, i.e. the basic measure of polymorphism, has previously been dismissed. Here, we investigate the thermal plasticity of abdominal pigmentation in eight Drosophila species, four belonging to the melanogaster species group and four to the montium group. Despite a conserved developmental pathway for melanin synthesis, the genetic architecture of its variation has significantly evolved, being polygenic in most species (like D. melanogaster) and Mendelian or invariable in others. By investigating the thermal plasticity of this trait in species with distinct architectures, we show the degree of plasticity to strongly associate with heterozygosity. Plasticity was resurrected in hybrids between species with no plastic responses but with contrasting melanism, and was higher in heterozygotes in species with simple Mendelian polymorphism. In plastic cases, pigmentation dominance is reversed depending on the developmental temperature. We propose simple genetic models with empirical molecular support to explain this link between phenotypic plasticity and genetic polymorphism. The relationship between these two phenomena, and the impact of each on the evolution of the other, may be more relevant than it is currently appreciated.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Heterogeneity of treatment effects, which reflects variability in individual responses to interventions, is a critical factor in determining the generalizability and personalization needs of treatments. Here, we conducted a registered meta-analysis of 62 studies and 1,112 comparisons in rodent models to evaluate the impact of environmental enrichment on depressive and anxiety-like behaviours. We found that environmental enrichment reduced these behaviours of animal models by 16% on average and decreased inter-individual variability by 12%, indicating not only effectiveness but also low heterogeneity of treatment effects, which suggests consistent effects across individuals. Environmental enrichment further nullified the adverse effects of stressors, demonstrating a significant antagonistic interaction. These effects were robust across multiple sensitivity analyses, including model-based predictions, post-stratification, multi-model inference, publication bias correction, and critical appraisal of study quality. Moderator analyses highlighted the importance of exposure timing and the inclusion of social enrichment components. Taken together, our pre-clinical evidence on rodent models supports environmental enrichment as a low-cost, scalable, and biologically grounded intervention with translational relevance for developing equitable and accessible treatments for depression and anxiety. Given the importance of innovation and personalization in mental health care, the low heterogeneity of treatment effects of environmental enrichment positions it as a promising avenue for non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies that can be broadly applied without extensive tailoring.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

These mechanisms allow for some clones to evolve metastatic traits, evade the immune system, and resist chemotherapy. However, how cancer cells evolve in vivo remains poorly understood. This study investigates the in vivo changes in gene expression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells implanted in BALB/c mice. Methodology: We analyzed RNA-seq data from 4T1 TNBC cells and tumors at different growth stages (1-, 3-, and 6-week) to identify differentially expressed genes, protein-protein interactions, and ecDNA alterations. We also assessed how ecDNA and genomic instability proteins interact with anti-TNBC drugs. Results: Our results reveal early transcriptional shifts within one week of tumor implantation, showing rapid acclimation. Changes in gene expression continued over time, with significant molecular reprogramming observed at six weeks under in vivo environmental pressures, including ecDNA alterations and immune evasion. The shift from the earlier generation (1 week) to the later generation (6 weeks) suggests cumulative alterations in key oncogenic pathways related to tumor progression. Additionally, we found that mutations in ecDNA and genomic instability proteins influence drug binding affinity, suggesting that adaptive changes may impact chemotherapy response. Conclusions and Implications: This study provides new insights into how TNBC tumors may evolve over time and novel ecDNA-related mechanisms of possible tumor adaptation, highlighting potential biomarkers for tumor aggression and immune evasion, which could help develop more effective therapeutic strategies against TNBC.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

However, little is known about how their adaptive capability and strategies have been shaped throughout evolutionary history. Here, we explore this question based on a new leptomitid sponge fossil from the Cambrian Stage 4. The family Leptomitidae was an abundant sponge group inhabiting Cambrian soft substrates but significantly declined thereafter. The new species exhibits a sophisticated set of morphological characteristics adaptive to a shallow siliciclastic environment, which are unprecedented among leptomitids. These include (1) a robust body wall woven by spirally twisted monaxonic spicules; (2) a thick stub-like root tuft for anchoring; (3) spicules radiating out from the sponge body to prevent clogging and sinking; and (4) the inferred capability to close the osculum against unfavourable stimuli. Nevertheless, the new fossil species maintains a leptomitid body plan which lacks modularity and morphological plasticity, the two common and critical attributes in extant sponges to enhance flexibility and resilience in changing environmental conditions. This juxtaposition of evolutionary innovation and structural conservatism offers a compelling case for further exploration of the evolutionary mechanisms that shaped early sponge lineages.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Seasonal variations showed superior pregnancy rates in spring (62.83%) but higher reproductive efficiency and lower mortality in autumn. In a second experiment, 30 ewes divided into hCG, GnRH, and control groups. hCG and GnRH groups were mated to ram at synchronized estrus by two injections of 2ml PGF2 analogue (Dalmazin) given at 11 days apart. The control group received only saline. The blood samples were collected from jugular venipuncture (3ml) with a disposable syringe from day 2 to 16 after treatment. Plasma progesterone concentrations detected by ELISA were higher (P<0.05) in sheep as compared with saline treated controls and improved reproductive outcomes. The hCG group showed the best performance with a litter size of 1.28%, no embryonic mortality, and increased twinning and fecundity rates. The GnRH group also demonstrated enhanced reproductive efficiency with a litter size of 1.25% and no embryonic loss.

Recent work has demonstrated that parasites adapted to laboratory conditions are genomically variable, but little is known of the extent of genomic diversity from clinically isolated specimens. Methods In this retrospective observational genomic study, we isolated 15 T. cruzi specimens from 3 clinical studies of Chagas disease, representing different clinical contexts. We sequenced the genome of each strain and used single nucleotide variant (SNV) based analyses to estimate parasite genetic lineage, genomic population structure, regions of copy number plasticity, and to identify gene conversion events. In addition, we generated and annotated whole genome assemblies of each isolate. From these assemblies, we compared the repertoires of genes encoding for highly virulent and variable proteins that have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. Findings We identified parasites from two genetic lineages in this collection of clinical isolates. Our analysis revealed evidence of genomic instability. Diversity-generating copy number variation was statistically enriched in regions encoding the virulence-associated multigene families, while diversity-eliminating gene conversion events were enriched in regions depleted of multigene family members. We also discovered a set of multigene family members that is present in all of the clinically isolated parasite genomes and absent from all of the lab adapted strains, regardless of parasite lineage. Multigene family repertoires were more conserved among field isolated specimens of the same genetic lineage than among culture adapted strains of the same genetic type. Interpretation This study provides whole genome sequencing data for TcV parasites isolated from naturally infected human patients with Chagas disease for the first time. Our analysis of these genomes revealed substantial genomic instability, suggesting the parasite undergoes genomic change in response to the pressures imposed by the host environment. Moreover, we observed a set of virulence-associated genes that are present exclusively within clinical isolates and absent from lab-adapted strains, indicating a potential role for these genes in parasite survival in natural hosts. These findings highlight the limitations of genetic studies focused exclusively on lab-adapted parasite strains and provide insight into the genomic features of T. cruzi that are likely to be important for clinical infection.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

While the genetic cause of the disease is well studied, the molecular disease-driving mechanisms and how exercise can drive disease progression remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway to be downregulated in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and human explanted hearts carrying pathogenic PKP2 variants. The reduced expression of OXPHOS related genes was a result of lower PPARGC1A expression which led to decreased mitochondrial spare capacity in PKP2 mutant hiPSC-CMs. Induction of PPARGC1A expression partially restored the expression of OXPHOS components and improved contractility in PKP2 mutant cells. These results suggest that improving oxidative capacity through modulation of PPARGC1A in cardiomyocytes could be considered as a new therapeutic target for ACM patients in the future.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Kinetochores are multi-megadalton protein complexes essential for chromosome segregation in all eukaryotes, however recent structural, functional, and evolutionary studies have revealed divergent mechanisms of kinetochore assembly. In this study, we use cryo-EM to understand the structural mechanisms by which the budding yeast microtubule-binding outer kinetochore KMN complex assembles, and how its interactions with the centromere-binding inner kinetochore are regulated. The ten-subunit KMN complex comprises three subcomplexes: Knl1c, Mis12cMtw1c and Ndc80c. We show that -helical motifs in the C-termini of the Mis12cMtw1c subunits Dsn1, Mis12Mtw1 and Pmf1Nnf1 bind Knl1c and Ndc80c. At the opposite end of the Mis12cMtw1c stalk, an N-terminal auto-inhibitory segment of Dsn1 (Dsn1AI) folds into two -helices that engage its head 1 domain, thereby occluding binding sites for the inner kinetochore subunits CENP-CMif2 and CENP-UAme1, reducing their affinity for Mis12cMtw1. Our structure reveals how Aurora BIpl1 phosphorylation of Dsn1AI would release this auto-inhibition to substantially strengthen pre-existing connections between the inner and outer kinetochore.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

PLIN4 contains a giant (about 1000 aa) amphipathic helix, which folds on the LD surface and can substitute for phospholipids, thereby regulating LD surface tension. This region of PLIN4 is arranged in tandem repeats of 33 aa. Genetic expansion of this region is associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction in patients suffering from a late-onset vacuolar myopathy (MRUPAV). We demonstrate that purified fragments of the PLIN4 repetitive region form amyloid fibrils as characterized by cryo-EM and atomic force microscopy. The MRUPAV mutation drastically increases the kinetics of fibril formation and induces aggregation in budding yeast. The propensity to aggregate depends on the number of identical repeats and their sequence, and is strongly attenuated by the presence of lipid droplets, suggesting putative intervention strategies and an explanation for the observed tissue bias of the disease.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

J.; Zou, J.", "abstract": "Modern biology increasingly relies on complex, high dimensional datasets such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, the richness of such data means that conventional analyses may only scratch its surface. Extracting meaningful insights from these datasets often requires advanced computational methods and domain expertise. Current AI agents for biology are primarily focused on executing user-specified commands and are therefore limited by the user's creativity and familiarity with which kinds of analyses are useful. Furthermore, these agents do not account for prior analyses already attempted by researchers, reducing their ability to build upon existing work. To address these limitations, we introduce CellVoyager, an AI agent that autonomously explores scRNA-seq datasets in novel directions conditioned on prior user-ran analyses. Built on large language models, CellVoyager ingests both the dataset and a record of prior analyses to generate and test new hypotheses within a Jupyter notebook environment. We evaluate CellVoyager on CellBench, a new benchmark based on 50 published scRNA-seq studies encompassing 483 analyses. Given only the background sections of these papers, CellVoyager outperformed GPT-4o and o3-mini by up to 20% in predicting which analyses the authors eventually conducted. We then carried out three in-depth case studies where CellVoyager is given previously published papers with their scRNA-seq datasets and conducts analyses to generate new findings. The original authors of each study evaluated these findings and consistently rated them as creative and sound; 80% of the agent's hypotheses were deemed scientifically interesting. For example, in one case study, the agent found that CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 infection are more primed for pyroptosis, which was not explored by the original researchers. CellVoyager also reanalyzed a brain aging dataset to discover a previously unreported association between increased transcriptional noise and aging in the subventricular zone of the brain. These results demonstrate that CellVoyager can act both autonomously and collaboratively to accelerate hypothesis generation and computational biology. It also highlights the potential of agents like CellVoyager to unlock new biological insights by reanalyzing the vast existing biological data at scale.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

The immune dysregulation caused by the parasite may lead to bacterial superinfections and increase mortality. We reveal that Pf exploits extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by infected red blood cells (iRBC-EVs) to deliver host-derived miR451a to human neutrophils, impairing their antimicrobial defences. Neutrophil phagocytosis of iRBC-EVs suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and compromised microbicidal activity against Salmonella typhimurium. Microfluidic assays show that miR451a transfer significantly disrupts neutrophil chemotaxis and swarming upon microbial challenge. Transcriptomic profiling indicates that EVs and miR451a reprogram neutrophil gene expression, notably upregulating ferroptosis-related genes, suggesting a role in further impairing immune responses.

Despite multiple recent outbreaks, there are no approved antiviral drugs to treat any alphavirus infection. Therefore, developing broadly acting antiviral drugs effective against multiple alphaviruses is necessary and could provide protection from both current and emerging alphavirus threats. A critical component of the alphavirus replication complex is non-structural protein 2 (nsP2), which is a multifunctional enzyme containing a helicase domain connected to a protease domain by a flexible linker. nsP2 functions as an ATP-dependent helicase, is conserved across the alphavirus genus, and is essential for virus replication, making it a promising target for development of alphavirus broad-acting antiviral drugs. Previous studies identified an enantioselective compound RA-0025298 that inhibited nsP2 ATPase activity and chikungunya virus CHIKV replication. Antiviral testing of RA-25298. against a diverse group of alphaviruses found broad activity except for Sindbis-like viruses. Using this information along with mutational profiling of virus passaged with RA-0025298 we identified the site of RA-0025298 action and confirmed the binding site via biophysical analyses. Finally, we found that the active enantiomer of RA-0025298 (SGC-NSP2hel-1) reduced viral loads in vivo and protected mice from tissue damage and disease caused by CHIKV infection.

However, their presence varies in the stingless bee clade (Meliponini), a group with pantropical distribution.

The dominant microbiota of Melipona species includes members of the genera Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Apilactobacillus, Floricoccus, and Bombella. Among these, Apilactobacillus and Bombella dominate in the crop, whereas Apilactobacillus and other members of the Lactobacillaceae dominate the ventriculus.

The cytoskeleton portion of the organelle is a network of filaments composed of proteins called alveolins, whose precise functions and organization are poorly understood. Here we describe the function of the founding member of the Toxoplasma alveolins, IMC1, which we show is expressed and loaded onto forming daughter buds with IMC4, but later than the other key alveolins IMC3, IMC6, and IMC10. Disruption of IMC1 results in severe morphological defects that impact the integrity of the parasite's cytoskeleton and disrupt invasion, replication, and egress. Loss of IMC1 in a less virulent type II strain results in a dramatic loss of infectivity and complete failure to form a chronic infection. We then use deletion analyses to dissect functional regions of the protein which reveals a key subregion of the alveolin domain that is sufficient for IMC targeting and also required for function. We then show that IMC1 interacts directly with IMC4 and the loss of IMC1 results in mislocalization of IMC4 specifically in forming daughter buds. This study thus reveals the critical role that IMC1 plays in forming and maintaining the architecture of the filamentous network of the IMC.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Immune-competent individuals are usually asymptomatic for disease. However, immune dysregulation in latently-infected individuals can result in viral reactivation, often causing further complications. Viral gene transcription during latency is restricted, although the CMV-encoded G-protein coupled receptor homologs, US28 and UL78, are expressed. We and others find US28 is critical for establishing and maintaining viral latency, in part, through regulating host cell signaling. How US28 switches from pro-latent to pro-lytic during reactivation, however, is unknown, though our findings herein reveal a role for UL78. Myeloid cells infected with a UL78 ORF deletion mutant maintain viral latency yet fail to efficiently reactivate. However, the UL78 G protein-coupling domain is not required for reactivation, suggesting UL78-mediated signaling is not critical for reactivation. Prior work revealed UL78 and US28 interact, resulting in altered US28-mediated signaling. Additionally, we showed US28 attenuates ERK phosphorylation during latency, while ERK is phosphorylated upon reactivation; however, the mechanism underlying this switch is unknown. Thus, we hypothesized the UL78:US28 interaction is important for altering US28-mediating signaling upon viral reactivation. We find US28 and UL78 interact during lytic infection of fibroblasts and colocalize in myeloid cells upon their differentiation. Further, reactivation in myeloid cells latently-infected with wild-type virus results in upregulated ERK phosphorylation, while parallel cultures infected with the UL78-deficient virus fail to do so.

Remarkably, macrolides that bind in the peptide exit tunnel some ~10A away from the PTC also remotely inhibit PTC and cause translational arrest depending on the synthesized polypeptide sequence. The Arg/Lys-X-Arg/Lys (also known as +X+) motif is particularly susceptible to this inhibition, as peptidyl-tRNA carrying nascent peptide with penultimate arginine or lysine residue fails to react with aminoacyl-tRNA carrying the same amino acids in the presence of macrolides. While structural studies of macrolide-bound ribosomes have shed light on the context-specific nature of this inhibition, the precise roles of the drug, ribosome, and tRNA in modulating PTC activity remain unclear. In this study, we present a detailed structural analysis of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) that represent either arrested or non-arrested states, containing various combinations of peptidyl- and aminoacyl-tRNAs, with or without macrolides.

However, the rational tuning of the mechanical properties of such ELMs from first principles remains a challenge. Here we use synthetic cell-cell adhesins to systematically characterize how rheological and viscoelastic properties of multicellular materials made from living bacteria can be tuned via adhesin strength, cell size and shape, and adhesion logic. We confirmed that the previous results obtained for non-living materials also apply to bacterial ELMs. Additionally, the incorporation of synthetic adhesins, combined with the adaptability of bacterial cells in modifying various cellular parameters, now enables novel and precise control over material properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that rheology is a powerful tool for actively shaping the microscopic structure of ELMs, enabling control over cell aggregation and particle rearrangement, a key feature for complex material design. These results deepen our understanding of tuning the viscoelastic properties and fine structure of ELMs for applications like bioprinting and microbial consortia design including natural systems.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Yet, knowledge of transmission-specific traits remains lacking. Here, we report the discovery of a specific adaptive response to desiccation, a stress intrinsically linked to the generation of the aerosol droplets within which Mtb transmits. We show that desiccation inflicts oxidative damage and activates DNA repair responses but that this repair is imperfect and results in mutations. We further show that activation of these DNA repair responses is accompanied by increased expression of the transcription-coupled repair factor, mfd, but that this expression serves to buffer the fitness cost of specific resistance-conferring mutations in rpoB, the target of the frontline drug rifampin, rather than to facilitate transcription-coupled DNA repair. Silencing mfd during aerosolization impairs survival of strains harboring the rifampin resistance allele S450L. This function is further supported by whole genome sequence data from over 50,000 clinically circulating strains. These studies indicate that Mtb has evolved transmission-specific stress responses that have enabled it to leverage desiccation-induced DNA damage as a potential source of genetic diversification and drug resistance.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

It is a bacterial photoreceptor that triggers a range of responses in different bacteria: phototaxis, biosynthesis of photo-protective pigments, and light regulation of biofilm formation. An important gap in knowledge on PYP is the signal transduction chain that guides the initial signal from the photoreceptor to various biological responses. Here we report an expanded set of 984 PYP homologs, providing information on sequence conservation and variation. We analyze this set of PYPs using two bioinformatics approaches to identify candidate proteins that are functionally related to PYP. First, we identified 153 multi-domain proteins containing PYP and analyzed the domain composition of these proteins. Specific preferences for N- or C-terminal placement of the PYP domain were observed. Second, we identified 113 predicted multi-gene operons containing the pyp gene. These two approaches yielded multiple candidates for proteins in the signal transduction chain associated with PYP, particularly histidine kinase (implying phosphorylation), methyl accepting chemotaxis protein (implying phototaxis), and GGDEF and EAL proteins (implying a role of c-di-GMP and biofilm formation). Some of these candidates were present only in multi-domain proteins and others only in pyp operons. Overexpression of the PYP domain from the MCP-fusion protein from Nitrincola alkalilacustris yielded a protein with an absorbance maximum of 447 nm and an overall photocycle rate of 0.5 seconds.

The renal component of this disorder is characterised by proximal tubular dysfunction. Here, a proximal tubular cell line, RPTEC-TERT1, was CRISPR-edited to knock out (KO) VPS33B expression. Characterisation of VPS33B-KO cells was performed using brightfield imaging, immunostaining, RNA sequencing, and cell detachment assays. The VPS33B-KO RPTEC-TERT1 cells demonstrated a 'peeling' phenotype and altered cell adhesion. This, along with altered transcription of genes associated with cell adhesion, suggests that VPS33B KO results in cell-matrix attachment defects.

Here, we present for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the morphogenesis of gill arteries, filaments and lamellae during lifelong development. Our results provide important insights into the temporal and spatial pattern of gill angiogenesis, revealing fundamental differences in the formation of lateral versus medial filaments along the dorso-ventral axis. These early asymmetries correlate with, and likely underlie, the structural asymmetries observed in adult gills, which we quantitatively characterize. This indicates that a region-specific developmental programme establishes a blueprint for gill architecture maintained throughout life. We further show that lamellae develop through a complex interplay between endothelial and cranial neural crest-derived pillar cells. Notably, lamellar size, which strongly influences respiratory efficiency, depends on the position of the filament in the arch. Together, our work identifies key cellular and temporal mechanisms driving gill development and provides a framework to investigate broader principles of branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis in vertebrates.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Pig body weight values estimated by a conventional approach or a computer vision system can be considered as two different measurements of the same trait, but with different sources of phenotyping error. Previous studies have shown that trait measurement error, defined as the difference between manually collected phenotypes and image-derived phenotypes, can be influenced by genetics, suggesting that the error is systematic rather than random and is more likely to lead to misleading quantitative genetic analysis results. Therefore, we investigated the effect of trait measurement error on genetic analysis of pig body weight (BW). Results: Calibrated scale-based and image-based BW showed high coefficients of determination and goodness of fit. Genomic heritability estimates for scale-based and image-based BW were mostly identical across growth periods. Genomic heritability estimates for trait measurement error were consistently negligible, regardless of the choice of computer vision algorithm. In addition, genome-wide association analysis revealed no overlap between the top markers identified for scale-based BW and those associated with trait measurement error. Overall, the deep learning-based regressions outperformed the adaptive thresholding segmentation methods. Conclusions: This study showed that manually measured scale-based and image-based BW phenotypes yielded the same quantitative genetic results. We found no evidence that BW trait measurement error could be influenced, at least in part, by genetic factors. This suggests that trait measurement error in pig BW does not contain systematic errors that could bias downstream genetic analysis.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Therapeutic targeting of Trp metabolism could be relevant to several pathologies. In cancer, IDO1 acts as an immune checkpoint suppressing effector T cell function. Yet, direct inhibition of IDO1 has had limited success in clinical trials. Therefore, alternative approaches to Trp metabolism therapeutic targeting are needed. We screened a library of 597 natural products (NPs) or NP derivatives for their effect on kynurenine production in triple negative breast cancer cells. This revealed 24 candidate inhibitors of kynurenine production. Amongst them, artemether, a member of the artemisinin family of anti-malarial drugs, suppressed kynurenine production, likely via an endoperoxide bridge-dependent mechanism. The Euphorbia factor L9 (EFL9) inhibited kynurenine production likely via a C7-benzoylation-dependent mechanism. Neither artemether nor EFL9 affected JAK/STAT signaling or IDO1 levels. Targeted metabolomics analyses demonstrated that artemether suppressed kynurenine production through heme sequestration, a mechanism that would affect all members of the IDO/TDO family of metalloenzymes. EFL9 affected purine and amino acid metabolism and the cellular redox balance. Comparisons to the effects of ouabain, a NP regulator of IDO1 levels, and Linrodostat, a clinically used small molecule IDO1 inhibitor, revealed distinct metabolic profiles, with ouabain and EFL9 showing the largest overlap. Importantly, the kynurenine-suppressing activity of artemether and EFL9 is not cancer cell-specific. Overall, our findings set the foundation for the use of derivatives of artemether or EFL9 as novel Trp metabolism-targeting therapeutics.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

BM results from mutations in genes encoding one of the three  chains of collagen VI (ColVI), a component of the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix produced by interstitial fibroblasts. A still unresolved issue in BM is how alteration in ColVI present outside muscle fibers induces dysfunction within muscle fibers. In the present study, we explored properties of excitation-contraction coupling on isolated fast skeletal muscle fibers from one-year old zebrafish col6a1{Delta}ex14 harboring an exon-skipping mutation (col6a1{Delta}ex14) that is the most frequently found in BM patients. Col6a1{Delta}ex14 fish muscle exhibited age-dependent progressive loss of ColVI deposition, accompanied with defects in basement membrane organization and ColVI intracellular accumulation. Muscle action potentials were found to be unchanged in col6a1{Delta}ex14 fish as compared to wild-type. The density of charge movements produced by depolarization-induced activation of dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), that control sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release, was found to be reduced and their voltage-dependence shifted toward negative potentials in col6a1{Delta}ex14 fish. Concomitantly, the voltage dependence of depolarization-evoked intracellular Ca2+ transients was also shifted toward negative voltages, promoting in this way an elevated pathogenic SR Ca2+ leak at resting membrane potentials, as evidenced by higher density of Ca2+ sparks at rest, larger SR Ca2+ release in response to long-duration depolarizations between -70 and -40 mV and reduced twitch muscle force and swimming performance. Finally, clusters of 1S subunits of DHPR were found to be mis-localized in mutant fibers t-tubules. These data suggest that Col6 deficiency in BM leads to an alteration of the DHPR function that contributes to promote a pathogenic SR Ca2+ leak. DHPR could represent the still elusive link that allows altered myomatrix to transduce pathogenic signals within muscle.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

We reveal, with unprecedented resolution, the extraordinary genetic diversity within these sexually dimorphic cell types and find birth order represents a novel axis of sexual differentiation. Neuronal identity in the adult reflects spatiotemporal patterning and sex-specific survival, with female-biased neurons arising early and male-biased neurons arising late.

Here, we show that the animate-inanimate distinction is preserved even among images of objects that are made unrecognizable and only retain low- and mid-level visual features of their natural version. In particular, in three experiments, healthy human adults saw rapid sequences of images (6 Hz) where every five exemplars of a category (i.e., animate), an exemplar of another category (i.e., inanimate) was shown (1.2 Hz). Using frequency-tagging electroencephalography (ftEEG), we found significant neural responses at 1.2 Hz, indicating rapid and automatic detection of the periodic categorical change. Moreover, such effect was found -although increasingly weaker- for 'impoverished' stimulus-sets that retained only certain (high-, mid- or low-level) features of the original colorful images (i.e., grayscale, texform and phase-scrambled images), and even if the images were unrecognizable. Similar effects were found with two Deep Neural networks (DNNs) presented with the same stimulus-sets.

Auditory hypersensitivity can also be observed in the FMR1- knockout (KO) mice, a well-established mouse model of autism and FXS. FXS is an X-linked disorder that is more prevalent in males compared to females, as a result most auditory and electrophysiology studies are performed in males. Previous in-vivo electrophysiology studies at the inferior colliculus (IC), an essential component of the auditory pathway, in male FMR1-KO mice at post-natal days 14, 21 and 34 (P14, P21 and P34) demonstrated increased neuronal firing, suggesting that the IC could play a role in auditory hypersensitivity. However, very little is known about the role of the central nucleus of the IC (ICc) and auditory hypersensitivity in females. Methods: Here we investigated auditory processing at P20 and P30, representative of early and late developmental stage of auditory development, respectively, at the central nucleus of the IC (ICc) of both female and male FMR1-KO mice, compared with wildtype (WT) animals. Results: In-vivo electrophysiology recordings from the ICc neurons of the FMR1-KO mice at both developmental ages demonstrated increased response magnitude measured by spike number to pure tones of varying frequency and amplitude, compared with age- and sex-matched WT animals. In addition, within the FMR1-KO group we also observed significant developmental and sex difference wherein higher response magnitudes were displayed at P20 and in the female mice. Minimum threshold of ICc neuron in the KO mice was significantly decreased at both P20 and P30. The ICc neurons in the KO mice also displayed increased response duration compared to WT animals at both P20 and P30, but significant sex difference was only observed at P30. Our data also indicated that the ICc neurons of both groups displayed weak negative relationship between latency and response magnitude at P20, and at P30 the WT mice showed a stronger relationship only in the female group. In terms of developmental changes, we observed decreasing neuronal firing only in the KO mice between 20- and 30-day old female and male mice. Reduced response duration was observed in 30-day old mice of both sexes of both genotypes. Regarding minimum threshold, we observed a decline between early and late auditory development only in the male mice. Finally, our results also indicated that in the WT mice the reverse relationship between latency and response magnitude became more pronounced and consistent with age, a developmental trend that was absent in both the female and male FMR1-KO mice. Discussion: Overall, our findings demonstrate that auditory processing deficits can also be observed in the female FMR1-KO mice using in-vivo electrophysiology studies, highlighting the importance of including female subjects in future studies. These results also indicate that auditory hypersensitivity can be observed robustly in younger mice, suggesting that the early development stage could be an ideal target for interventions.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Deep and superficial PCs form biased circuits with perisomatic-targeting PV+ basket cells, but it is unknown if such cell-type-specific circuit motifs extend to dendrite-targeting interneurons. Using male and female mice, we investigated synaptic connectivity and physiology in brain slices from four transgenic lines thought to capture distinct subsets of interneurons: SST-IRES-Cre, Nkx2.1-Cre, Chrna2-Cre, and Htr3a-GFP. First, we found that oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells captured by the Chrna2-Cre line are a subset of Htr3a-GFP+ cells in the hippocampus. This novel finding is consistent with previous work showing Nkx2.1-Cre OLM cells are distinct from both Chrna2-Cre and Htr3a-GFP+ cells. Indeed, in paired whole-cell recordings, Nkx2.1-Cre+ interneurons in the stratum oriens, but not Chrna2-Cre+ or Htr3a-GFP+ cells, received more excitatory synaptic connections from superficial PCs relative to deep PCs. Next, we used optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping to investigate inhibition along the proximal and distal dendrites of PCs. We found that superficial PCs received stronger inhibition along their proximal dendrites than deep PCs from SST+ interneurons. Furthermore, this circuit motif was dependent on layer but not PC projection class. Finally, Chrna2-Cre OLM cells provided stronger inhibition to the distal dendrites of deep PCs relative to superficial PCs. Our data reveal that superficial and deep PCs engage in cell-type-specific circuits with dendrite-targeting interneurons.

Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered six distinct microglial subtypes exhibiting unique regional signatures, including a subtype highly enriched for the GABAB receptor gene within striatal organoids. To investigate the contributions of microglia to neural circuitry, we created microglia-incorporated midbrain-striatal assembloids, modeling a core circuit node for many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism.

Leveraging this model, we examined microglial responses within neural circuits harboring an SCN2A nonsense (C959X) mutation associated with profound autism. Remarkably, microglia displayed heightened calcium responses to SCN2A mutation-mediated neuronal hyperactivity, and engaged in excessive synaptic pruning. These pathological effects were reversed by pharmacological inhibition of microglial GABAB receptors.

These steps require coordinated temporal and regional gene expression to define the lung epithelium in preparation for the first breath at birth. While the transcriptional and signaling regulators required for lung development are increasingly well known, the key epigenetic complexes that interact with lineage transcription factors for cell-specific control of gene expression remain to be defined. Here, we identify a key role for the canonical BAF complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, during lung epithelial development. Loss of canonical BAF activity throughout the foregut endoderm leads to complete failure of lung formation, and selective deletion of a single key subunit, ARID1A, leads to failure of proximal-distal axis specification, with dilated airway-like structures lined by ectopic basal cells found throughout the distal lung, and failure of specification of alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells in the distal saccular epithelium. In place of AT1 cells, we identified a highly proliferative epithelial cell state defined by joint activation of YAP and WNT signaling and loss of BMP signaling response, leading to increased proliferation and failure of appropriate epithelial differentiation. These changes resulted in secondary failure of mesenchymal and endothelial specification, leading to broad loss of patterning of the distal lung further disrupting peripheral lung morphogenesis. Using embryonic lung organoids, we demonstrate that exogenous BMP4 signaling is sufficient to rescue AT1 and AT2 cell differentiation in ARID1A-null epithelium, while WNT and YAP signaling require functional BAF complex. Together, these data demonstrate a requirement for the BAF complex for lung formation, proximal-distal patterning, and cell fate acquisition, and reveal surprising differential specificity between signaling pathways during lung development.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Here we ask how similar are genes differentially expressed in neurons across a representative set of eight animals with a nervous system, and tally the presence or absence of their homologs in 10 animals and two choanoflagellates. We show that proteins from 39 families are differentially expressed in all neurons, regardless of the phylogenetic placement of their lineage, and that the majority of these gene families are present in the (unicellular) closest relatives of animals, choanoflagellates. We found that the members of these 39 gene families are enriched in domains for ion transport and juxtacrine signalling, and that there is one gene family of zinc-dependent extracellular matrix-remodelling proteins which is only found in animals bearing a nervous system. Our results show that common genetic toolkits are in place for the function of nervous systems. We identify a large number of potential new genomic markers linked to the nervous system and hope they can complement ongoing research efforts to better understand this quintessentially animal system.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

They are a source of short tandem repeats (STRs), which often expand in size and originate inherited neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders. How expanded STR insertion mutations within Alu STRs culminate in disease remains unknown. Here we report an Alu STR located in an intron of DAB1 that functions as a neurodevelopmental enhancer. We demonstrated that an ATTTC repeat insertion in this DAB1 Alu STR, known to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 37 (SCA37), hyperactivates a neurodevelopmental DAB1 enhancer. Importantly, we showed that neurons derived from SCA37 subjects have higher levels of DAB1 expression and DAB1 overexpression causes abnormal axonal pathfinding in vivo. Overall, these results establish that neuronal dysregulation of a developmental DAB1 Alu STR enhancer contributes to SCA37 pathogenesis, an unexplored mechanism likely acting in many Alu STR diseases, potentially reshaping the therapeutic landscape.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The accumulation of abnormal tau protein selectively affects distinct brain regions and specific populations of neurons and glial cells in tau-related dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Pick's disease (PiD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Although the three disorders share the feature of tau protein pathology, the regulatory circuitry of non-coding genetic variants underlying risk-associated cell states remains to be elucidated. Using paired single-nucleus profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression across AD, PiD, and PSP, we define cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) across six cell types and fifty subclasses. Comparing disease-dynamic CREs across three disorders, we find that glia overrepresent disorder-specific gene regulation related to dynamic cellular response to stress. We show that human genetic variants affecting microglial gene regulation converge into distinct and co-regulated modules affecting specific cellular functions. Moreover, polygenic risk modifiers are maximally co-accessible in disorder-specific glial states, modifying distinct pathways such as sphingomyelin regulation in PiD. Our study informs glial regulators linked to polygenic modifiers of primary tauopathy, introducing modifiable pathways governing resilience for therapeutic consideration.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Chd8+/- mouse models exhibit macrocephaly and transcriptional pathology, with inconsistent findings regarding neurogenesis, neuron function, and behavior. Via stereology and single nuclei transcriptomics (snRNA-seq), we found increased Chd8+/- cortical volume was not explained by increase in neuron number. Differential expression (DE) was present across cortical cell types, with excitatory neurons exhibiting high DE burden and shared and subclass-specific DE signatures. Bulk RNA-seq DE of constitutive Chd8+/- and conditional Camk2a-Cre Chd8+/- mice identified shared transcriptional pathology. DE in synaptosomal versus nuclear mRNA identified overlapping DEGs, but also significant differences and exaggerated synaptosomal changes. Building on DE findings implicating glutamatergic neurons, we found Chd8+/- mice exhibited altered excitatory neuron spine density and dynamics, decreased GCaMP activity correlation, and sleep perturbation. Thus, Chd8 haploinsufficiency causes lasting excitatory neuron dysfunction, perturbs RNA regulation beyond transcription, and impacts neuronal properties, cortical microcircuits, and behavior.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

B.; Di Rienzo, A.", "abstract": "Tibetan adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia remains a classic example of Darwinian selection in humans. To identify adaptive traits that might have evolved in Tibetans in response to long-term exposure to hypoxia, we previously established a library of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from Tibetan and Han Chinese individuals, as a robust model system for the exploration of condition-specific molecular and cellular responses. We used this system to characterize and compare the transcriptome of iPSC-derived endothelial cells and found that angiogenesis, energy metabolism and immune pathways differ between the cell lines from these two populations. Here, we harness the same experimental system to characterize and compare the transcriptome of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in Tibetan and Han Chinese in hypoxia. We find that several pathways, such as the hypoxia, myogenesis and glycolysis pathways, are significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes across populations. These pathways are candidate targets of natural selection due to exposure to the high-altitude hypoxic environment and point to adaptive cardiac traits such as sustained cardiac function in hypoxia. A better understanding of these adaptations may offer insights into novel therapeutic strategies for hypoxia-related cardiovascular conditions, such as pulmonary hypertension and ischemic heart disease.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

A.; Ramsay, L.; von Wettberg, E. B.; Bett, K.", "abstract": "Chromosome structural rearrangements play a significant role in karyotype evolution and speciation. These rearrangements pose challenges for precise karyotyping, leading to asymmetric chromosomes and complicating the assembly of a genus pan-genome for crops and their wild relatives. Lens culinaris, an important cool-season legume primarily cultivated in India and Canada, is the cultivated species among six wild relatives. All seven species of Lens face significant challenges due to chromosomal rearrangements, ranging from introgression issues to difficulties in developing a precise karyotype and advancing genomic studies. Using the gene synteny analysis between the cultivated Lens species and six wild relatives, we developed cross-species oligo-FISH (Fluorescent in situ hybridization) probes aiming to further attest to the genome assembly and synteny analysis of Lens species. Roots of seven Lens spp. accessions were harvested and used for chromosome spread preparations. Those slides were then used for Oligo-FISH experiments, where the DNA present in the slides was denatured, and a set of red and green oligo probes was hybridized to the chromosomes. Pictures were taken using a fluorescence microscope. The combination of both oligo sets/probes resulted in a distinct pattern for each Lens spp. chromosome, allowing the inference of the most precise karyotype to date for six Lens species. The number of oligo probe signals reflects the species' phylogenetic proximity, while the distribution of those signals changed drastically within the same gene pool. The karyotyping of Lens confirmed the proper assignment of chromosomes in the genome assemblies and validated the rearrangements detected in the synteny analysis. Differences in the assembly probe prediction and the oligo-FISH results were used to improve the assemblies. The results attest to a higher sequence-level similarity among the closest related species despite the occurrence of several structural changes among them. The oligo-FISH probes can be used in conjunction with plant genome assembly projects, supporting the delivery of a precise representation of their physical chromosomes.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

M.; Weigel, D.; Schneeberger, K.", "abstract": "Centromeres are specialized chromosome regions essential for sister chromatid cohesion and spindle attachment during mitosis. Many centromeres comprise highly variable, megabase-scale satellite DNA arrays, yet the mutation spectrum driving this variability remains poorly understood. Using replicated genome assemblies of six Arabidopsis mutation accumulation lines, we identified centromeric mutations consisting almost exclusively of point mutations and structure-preserving, in-frame indels spanning a few kilobases. Centromeric point mutations occurred at a ninefold higher rate (6.1x10^-8/bp/gen) than in chromosome arms, frequently introduced by non-allelic gene conversions from closely linked repeat units. Forward-in-time simulations based on the observed mutation spectrum recapitulated the emergence of megabase-scale higher-order repeat (HOR) structures, including long-range sequence similarities, without requiring large-scale rearrangements, closely mirroring centromeric divergence among natural genomes. Our results show that centromere evolution is driven by a unique mutational spectrum, providing a quantitative framework to understand how small-scale mutations shape and maintain the large-scale architecture of centromeric DNA.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": ""}

Many efforts have tried to quantify the degree of tissue specificity of individual genes. The growing availability of single-cell transcriptomic data greatly expands the context in which expression specificity can be assessed. We present a computational strategy to globally analyse and compare the specificity of genes and groups of related genes across different contexts. By representing expression profiles in terms of expression level-breadth (L-B) relationships, we are able to quantify and construct 2D landscapes that provide a globally consistent coordinate system to map specificity patterns. We characterize these landscapes at different levels of resolution and across species to demonstrate simple strategies for comparative transcriptomics. We use this approach to investigate the tissue, cell type, and neuronal specificity of human genes and generate reference specificity landscapes. Finally, by comparing the specificity of brain cell subtypes across 4 primate species we find that their degree of conservation mirrors evolutionary divergence times.
