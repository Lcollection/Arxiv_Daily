By specifically inactivating the RA receptor alpha (RAR) in type 3 lymphocytes and using a combination of fetal thymic organ cultures and single-cell RNA-sequencing we found that RA strengthened TCR signaling to limit the embryonic development of interleukin(IL)-17-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells ({gamma}{delta}T17), while at the same time it promoted their survival after birth. In adult mice, RA imposed a multi-level transcriptional program allowing {gamma}{delta}T17 cells to become activated, survive and sense interferon. Consequently, cells with inactive RAR responded poorly to immunization and produced low level of cytokines leading to near disease resistance in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. Finally, RA was required for optimal expression of the 4{beta}1 integrin and {gamma}{delta}T17 cell infiltration to the brain. Collectively, these studies suggest that by acting at various stages during the lifetime of {gamma}{delta} T cells, RA supports their normal development, their survival and their ability to respond to inflammatory stimuli.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

As a result, it can generate genotype-environment correlations at migration-associated loci that cannot be corrected by standard methods used in genetic association studies. Here, we explore this phenomenon by looking into the dynamics of the spatial distribution of polygenic scores (PGSs) in the Estonian Biobank. We show that contemporary migrations intensify inter-regional differences in PGSs for many traits, with the effect of educational attainment (EA) PGS being the strongest and, to a large extent, explaining inter-regional differences in other PGSs. This differentiation is mainly driven by the migration of individuals with relatively high PGS for EA to the two largest cities from the rest of the country. Importantly, we replicate this pattern within families: individuals migrating to the major cities have, on average, higher PGS for EA relative to their siblings residing in other regions of Estonia. This trend is observed for the period starting from the mid-20th century to the present, despite substantial changes in Estonian society during this period. Thus, we show that there is increasing genetic differentiation at trait-associated loci between most urbanized regions of Estonia versus the rest of the country, leading to genotype-environment correlations that cannot be fully corrected using standard approaches. We also provide evidence for direct genetic effects on migration behaviour based on sibling analysis and discuss potential links between migration and EA.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

A common method is to adjust the effect of the covariates via a linear model and work with the resulting residuals. However, removing the effects of the covariates could potentially eliminate valuable information from the analysis. We propose a functional nonparametric covariance matrix estimator to account for any given value in the covariate(s), which allows a comparison of the functional covariance structures of the multivariate data. This comparison is facilitated via a test statistic involving the first eigenvalue of the combined form of covariance matrices of the two groups. Three different approaches, namely, the parametric Tracy-Widom, the semi-parametric Forkman's test, and the nonparametric Permutation method, are used to compute the approximate p-values of the test statistic. We have conducted extensive simulation studies to determine the type I error and power of the proposed hypothesis testing methods and developed practical recommendations for implementing this novel approach. Finally, we apply our methods to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers between dementia and non-dementia cohorts, which offers a fascinating insight into the differences between covariance structures of biomarkers amyloid {beta}(1-42) (A{beta}42), total tau (tau), and phosphorylated tau (ptau) for given values of age, sex, and years of education.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

A.; Perez-Sala, D.", "abstract": "Vimentin plays key roles in cell mechanosensing, cytoskeletal crosstalk and stress responses, and is finely tuned by posttranslational modifications. The vimentin single cysteine residue, C328, is a hotspot for modification and essential for filament remodeling by oxidants and electrophiles. With a pKa near physiological pH, C328 reactivity could be sensitive to cellular pH fluctuations. Here, we show that C328 modifications and vimentin reorganization by various reactive agents are modulated in response to pH variations. Lowering intracellular pH prevents, whereas intracellular alkalinization potentiates vimentin network disruption by oxidative and electrophilic species, including diamide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxynonenal. The protective effect associated with low pH is selective for vimentin since it does not preclude oxidant-elicited disruption of actin or tubulin structures. Vimentin C328A and C328H mutants are resistant to disruption under all pH conditions, which highlights the importance of the thiol group at this position for the sensitizing effect of alkaline pH. Chemogenetic and optogenetic modulation of cellular pH allow spatiotemporal tuning of vimentin susceptibility to oxidants, suggesting the potential role of pH in the regulation of vimentin organization at precise locations. Alkalinization and generation of reactive oxygen species cooperate at the cell front during migration. We show that vimentin disassembly at cell edges of migrating fibroblasts, and lamellipodia formation, are affected by pH changes and the presence of C328. We propose that vimentin C328 could behave as a coincidental pH and redox responsive element, contributing to the precise regulation of vimentin assembly by the concert of these factors, illustrating the pH dependence of cysteine-mediated redox signaling.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

While Nodal directs the asymmetric migration of CPCs, we find FGF signaling to be dispensable for this asymmetry, suggesting that FGF plays a permissive rather than instructive role. We further demonstrate that Nodal signaling induces asymmetries in actin cytoskeletal dynamics that correlate with the directional migration of CPCs, while FGF instead generally promotes the actin cytoskeleton of CPCs. In addition to influencing jogging, FGF and Nodal synergize to ensure proper heart looping. We also provide evidence that FGF contributes to heart looping by promoting the differentiation of the secondary heart field. Together, these findings offer insight into how the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling pathways regulate the cellular behaviors driving organ morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "In vertebrates, the glucocorticoid ''stress'' response (corticosterone or cortisol) through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis influences many essential functions, including behavior, metabolism, immunity, and ontogenetic transitions. During development, stress responses can be adaptive if they facilitate antipredator behavior and modulate developmental speed to adjust to environmental conditions; however, these same responses can be maladaptive when energetic costs become too high and developmental speed trades-off with size and health at maturity. Thus, the timing of HPA-axis development may be aligned with specific developmental challenges and opportunities presented by a species' life history strategy. In anurans (frogs and toads), corticosterone plays critical roles in development and behavior, and concentrations can fluctuate in response to environmental stressors. Given the role of corticosterone in ontogenetic changes and behaviors, we studied the development of the glucocorticoid stress response in tadpoles of the dyeing poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius), a species with a unique life history that includes transport to water after hatching on land and aggressive and cannibalistic behavior. We measured the excretion rate and whole-body concentration of corticosterone and the corticosterone response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in free-swimming tadpoles after transport and throughout metamorphosis. We found no significant differences across development in excretion rates or whole-body concentration of corticosterone, nor corticosterone response to ACTH, indicating that that the glucocorticoid response develops early in ontogeny. This pattern differs from those in other species, suggesting the unique ecological pressures faced by D. tinctorius have shaped the development of the glucocorticoid stress response in this species. More broadly, this study illustrates how life history strategies and tradeoffs impact the timing of the development of stress responsivity.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Here, I first investigate the sampling consistency of popular summary statistics of dispersal and show that estimators of \"lineage velocities'' are ill-defined. I then use simulations to investigate how local density regulation or shifting habitats perturb phylogeographic inference in continuous space and show that these can result in biased and overconfident estimates of ancestral locations and dispersal parameters. These, sometimes dramatic, distortions depend in complicated ways on the past dynamics of habitats and underlying population dynamics and dispersal processes. Consequently, the validity of continuous phylogeographic inferences is hard to assess and confidence can be much lower than suggested by the inferred posterior distributions, in particular when involving poorly sampled locations or extrapolations far into the past.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Although carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) is differentially expressed in many solid tumours, anti-CEACAM5 CAR T-cells are ineffective. Here, we have studied the interaction of CEACAM5 targeting primary CAR T-cells with colorectal cancer (CRC) cells using fluorescence microscopy. We found that CRC cells glycocalyx is much deeper than that of the CAR T cell causing delayed activation. Oscillating calcium fluxes, indicative of non-sustained CAR T cell activation and reduced cytotoxicity, were observed when CAR T cells interacted with CRC cells, which increased with increasing cell-seeding time. Imaging revealed that this effect correlated with a progressive loss of accessible CEACAM5 antigen on the CRC cell surface, possibly due to their sequestration in the intercellular junction, rendering CAR T cell engagement less effective. Local proteolytic treatment with trypsin to disrupt the CRC cell monolayer, using a micropipette, increased CEACAM5 availability, decreased glycocalyx thickness, and restored sustained CAR T cell calcium fluxes, increasing the killing of CRC cells. Similar enhanced interaction was observed after treatment of CRC cell monolayer with hyaluronidase, approved for use in humans. We observed limited availability of CEACAM5 on human colorectal cancer tissues, whereas treatment with trypsin or hyaluronidase increased accessibility.

A fundamental question they allow us to ask is how nearby cells orchestrate their gene expression. Rather than focus on how these cells (samples) communicate with each other, we reframe the problem to investigate how genes (features) coordinate their expression between neighboring cells. To study these phenomena -- called cross-expression -- we compare all genes to find pairs that coordinate their expression between adjacent cells, thereby avoiding curating gene lists or annotating cell types. Our end-to-end method recovers ligand-receptor pairs as cross-expressing genes and finds gene combinations that mark anatomical regions, complementing marker gene-based region annotation.

In this study, participants listened to the same auditory narrative twice; the narrative had a plot twist in the middle that dramatically shifted interpretations of the story. Using a robust within-subject whole-brain approach, we leveraged shifts in neural activity between the two listens to identify where latent representations are updated and, by extension, where interpretations are instantiated in the brain. We considered the story in terms of the broader narrative model and two specific components, episodes and characters. Neural activity patterns varied with participants' latent understanding of these three elements in overlapping but partially distinct sets of temporal, parietal, and prefrontal regions.

M.; Shen, A.", "abstract": "GerS is a key lipoprotein regulator of Clostridioides difficile spore germination that shares structural, but not sequence, similarity to LolA in Gram-negative bacteria. GerS and LolA have vastly different biological roles: LolA functions in the trafficking of lipoproteins across the periplasmic space to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, while GerS allosterically activates the germination-specific amidase CwlD in endospore-forming Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we explore the diversity of LolA-like proteins across bacteria and reveal that GerS homodimer formation is a conserved feature of Peptostreptococcaceae family orthologs. Since dimerization of C. difficile GerS occurs via strand-swapping, we sought to investigate the functional importance of its strand swap by identifying mutations that alter the GerS dimer:monomer equilibrium. Our analyses reveal that GerSK71R and GerSN74L substitutions in the strand-swap hinge of GerS stabilize the homodimer, while a GerST72P substitution promotes monomer formation. Conversely, substituting the highly conserved proline at the equivalent site in LolA for threonine converts LolA from a monomer to a homodimer. Since our data indicate that destabilizing the GerS dimer impairs both GerS:CwlD binding in vitro and CwlD function in C. difficile, strand-swapped dimer formation in LolA-like proteins enhances their affinity for their binding partners. These data are consistent with analyses of equivalent LolA mutants in E. coli and thus provide new insight into the evolution and specialization of this intriguing group of proteins across the bacterial domain.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated reinforcement learning in developing mice with mutations in either Tsc2 or Shank3, both high-confidence ASD risk genes associated with major syndromic forms of ASD. Using an odor-based two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, we tested early adolescent mice of both sexes and found male Tsc2 and Shank3B heterozygote (Het) mice showed enhanced learning performance compared to their wild type (WT) siblings. No gain of function was observed in females. Using a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based computational model to infer learning rate as well as policy-level task engagement and disengagement, we found that the gain of function in males was driven by an enhanced positive learning rate in both Tsc2 and Shank3B Het mice. The gain of function in Het males was absent when mice were trained with a probabilistic reward schedule. These findings in two ASD mouse models reveal a convergent learning phenotype that shows similar sensitivity to sex and environmental uncertainty. These data can inform our understanding of both strengths and challenges associated with autism, while providing further evidence that sex and experience of uncertainty modulate autism-related phenotypes.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Traditional species tree inference methods, though effective, are hampered by the need for high-coverage sequencing, high-quality genomic alignments, and extensive computational resources. To address these challenges, this study introduces WASTER, a novel de novo tool for inferring species trees directly from short-read sequences. WASTER employs a k-mer based approach for identifying variable sites, circumventing the need for genome assembly and alignment. Using simulations, we demonstrate that WASTER achieves accuracy comparable to that of traditional alignment-based methods, even for low sequencing depth, and has substantially higher accuracy than other alignment-free methods. We validate WASTER's efficacy on real data, where it accurately reconstructs phylogenies of eukaryotic species with as low depth as 1.5X. WASTER provides a fast and efficient solution for phylogeny estimation in cases where genome assembly and/or alignment may bias analyses or is challenging, for example due to low sequencing depth. It also provides a method for generating guide trees for tree-based alignment algorithms. WASTER's ability to accurately estimate trees from low-coverage sequencing data without relying on assembly and alignment will lead to substantially reduced sequencing and computational costs in phylogenomic projects.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Antigen presentation molecules play key roles in activating T cell immunity. Multiple complementary pathways are known to regulate classical MHC-I molecules at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. Intracellular trafficking mechanisms dictating post-transcriptional regulation of MR1, the MHC Class I-like molecule which restricts MAIT cells, have been an area of focus; however, little is known about MR1 transcriptional regulation. We demonstrate that, similar to classical MHC-I, interferons regulate MR1 transcription. Treatment of airway epithelial cells (AEC) with recombinant IFN{beta} or IFN{gamma} variably increased MR1 transcripts, while only IFN{gamma} significantly increased surface MR1 expression and enhanced antigen presentation to MAIT cells. The MR1 promoter contains binding motifs for interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), an important MHC-I transcription factor. IRF1 knockout reduced IFN{gamma}-stimulated MR1 transcription, surface expression, and antigen presentation. Conversely, knockout of Nod-like Receptor family CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5), a critical component of IFN{gamma}-induced MHC-I transcription, did not significantly impact MR1 expression. These findings were corroborated in primary human AEC treated with IFN{gamma}. In co-culture experiments, MAIT cells incubated with Streptococcus pneumoniae-infected primary AEC produced sufficient IFN{gamma} to stimulate upregulation of MR1 expression. Our data support a model where IFN{gamma} from activated MAIT cells or another source stimulates IRF1-dependent MR1 expression and antigen presentation, leading to greater MAIT cell activation. A robust MR1-dependent MAIT cell response may be beneficial for early infection responses, allowing minimal antigen stimulus to generate greater proinflammatory activity.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

C.; Glass, M.; Grimsey, N. L.", "abstract": "Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2) is a promising therapeutic target for modulating inflammation. Canonical signalling responses to receptor ligands are critically dependent on cell surface receptor expression. However, it is also now appreciated that intracellular G protein-coupled receptors can contribute to signalling responses and influence functional outcomes. Therefore, understanding how the subcellular distribution of receptors is controlled is also highly pertinent. CB2 is observed to be expressed at the cell surface as well as having a considerable proportion expressed intracellularly. Despite this distribution being well established, little is known about the regulation of CB2 anterograde trafficking and subcellular distribution. We report that sustained stimulation with a range of CB2 agonists concurrently internalises cell surface human CB2 and stimulates a distinct population of CB2 to be delivered to the cell surface, at various expression levels. We present evidence that the ligand-stimulated anterograde trafficking is a result of CB2 agonists, as well as inverse agonists, acting as pharmacological chaperones. We also report that a di-lysine (KK) motif in the CB2 C-terminal tail is required for basal delivery to the cell surface. Corroborating the hypothesis that CB2 ligands can act as pharmacological chaperones, sustained CB2 ligand stimulation induces cell surface expression of the mutated receptor and alters maturation states as measured by western blotting. Our finding that prolonged exposure to CB2 ligands can induce CB2 cell surface delivery via pharmacological chaperoning may well have important implications for optimal design of CB2-targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Two agents--both excluded from the RBC interior--markedly reduce the rate constant for O2 off-loading (kHbO2): p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS) reduces membrane O2 permeability (PM,O2 by ~82% (computed from kHbO2 in paper #3), and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS) by ~56%.

This priming behavior of flies relies on the well-studied olfactory memory circuits including Kenyon cells (KC), dopaminergic neurons (DANs), and mushroom body output neurons (MBONs). Aversive stimulus results in increased odor responses in reward DANs that innervate the {gamma}4 lobe of the mushroom body (MB) and decreased odor responses in a {gamma}4{gamma}5-innvervating repulsive MBON.

We aim to find an alternative simple, explainable, efficient and parallelisable model, which can flexibly scale up with a larger dataset and scale down to reduce model size, will significantly facilitate the practical implementation of myoelectric control. Approach: In this work, we discuss the scalability of a random forest (RF) for myoelectric control. We show how to scale an RF up and down during the process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and automatic self-calibration. The effects of diverse factors such as bootstrapping, decision tree editing (pre-training, pruning, grafting, appending), and the size of training data are systematically studied using EMG data from 106 participants including both low- and high-density electrodes. Main results: We examined several factors that affect the size and accuracy of the model. The best solution could reduce the size of RF models by {approx}500x, with the accuracy reduced by only 1.5%.

Researchers often expend considerable effort on custom programming, limiting analytical scale and efficiency. To overcome this critical bottleneck and empower broader research applications, we developed and introduce Athlytics, a computational framework specifically designed for processing Strava API data directly within R for longitudinal exercise physiology analysis. This framework provides a dedicated means to seamlessly integrate data acquisition with the calculation of key physiological indicators (such as ACWR reflecting training stress balance, EF assessing aerobic efficiency, and physiological decoupling indicating cardiovascular stability), based on activity summary data while carefully addressing necessary approximations for composite load metrics like TSS/HRSS, and multidimensional time-series visualization. By providing standardized function interfaces, Athlytics significantly lowers the technical barrier for conducting complex longitudinal analyses, enabling researchers to efficiently test hypotheses regarding the dynamic interplay between training stimuli, physiological efficiency, and stress responses. This work provides an open-source computational tool that fills a critical gap, contributing by substantially enhancing the feasibility, efficiency, and reproducibility of quantitative exercise physiology research utilizing widely available physiological sensor data through standardization and automation.

From single cell analysis, we identified two distinct sources of impaired tumor surveillance within tumor draining lymph nodes. First, we observed that a significant fraction of tumor draining lymph nodes had undergone cytokine-driven reprogramming, leading to reduced dendritic cell homing and limited T cell priming. Second, T cells undergoing successful activation exhibited limited expansion and constrained differentiation, marked by expression of the quiescence-associated transcription factor Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2). Overexpression of KLF2 in primary T cells limited both their differentiation and cytotoxic capacity.

We found that 1-deoxysphingolipids can be transported by the non-vesicular transporter CERT in vitro but are retained at ER exit sites (ERES) in cells, suggesting that they do not efficiently sort into vesicular carriers. Cells expressing disease-associated variants of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase (SPT) accumulated long-chain 1-deoxysphingolipids, which reduced ER membrane fluidity and enlarged ERES.

Previously, substitution-only mutation models have been considered to derive precise expectations and variances for mutated k-mers and intervals of mutated and nonmutated sequences.

Within this framework, we derive closed-form k-mer-based-estimators for the three fundamental mutation parameters: substitution rate, deletion rate, and average insertion length. We provide statistics of k-mers under this model and theoretical guarantees via concentration inequalities, ensuring correctness under reasonable conditions. Empirical evaluations on simulated evolution of genomic sequences confirm our theoretical findings, demonstrating that accounting for indel signals allows for accurate estimation of mutation rates and improves upon the results obtained by considering a substitution-only model.

While previous studies have documented basic structural characteristics of bat hearts, a comprehensive understanding of their response to physiological stress remains unexplored. This study investigates the cardiac adaptations of the cave nectar bat Eonycteris spelaea to elucidate the mechanisms underlying their unique physiological capabilities. Methods and Results: We performed RNA sequencing to analyse the cardiac gene expression profile of E. spelaea and 6 other bat species in comparison to mouse and human hearts, revealing enriched transcriptomic signatures related to oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism across multiple bat species. Metabolomic profiling compared acylcarnitine metabolites and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates between bat and mouse hearts, indicating a distinct acylcarnitine profile and increased levels of TCA cycle intermediates in bats, suggesting enhanced metabolic capacity. Structural adaptations were assessed through anatomical and histological analyses on cardiac tissues, showing thicker left ventricular walls and increased vascular density in bats without pathological hypertrophy. Functional characteristics were evaluated using dobutamine stress echocardiography, demonstrating superior cardiac reserve in bats with significant increases in ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output under stress conditions. Additionally, isolated cardiomyocytes were treated with Angiotensin II (Ang II) to assess stress responses. Bat cardiomyocytes displayed resistance to Ang II-induced hypertrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction compared to mice, further highlighting their resilience to stress-induced damage. Conclusion: The unique adaptations observed in bat hearts, including enhanced metabolic pathways, structural remodelling, and cellular resilience contribute to their ability to meet the high energy demands of powered flight while maintain cardiac function under stress. These insights into bat cardiac physiology provide valuable information on cardioprotective mechanisms that could be applicable to other species.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Quantifying atypical use of facial expressions during naturalistic social interactions in a reliable, objective, and direct manner is difficult, but potentially possible with facial analysis computer vision algorithms that identify facial expressions in video recordings. Methods: We analyzed >5 million video frames from 100 verbal children, 2-7-years-old (72 with autism and 28 controls), who were recorded during a ~45-minute ADOS-2 assessment using modules 2 or 3, where they interacted with a clinician. Three different facial analysis algorithms (iMotions, FaceReader, and Py-Feat) were used to identify the presence of six facial expressions (anger, fear, sadness, surprise, disgust, and happiness) in each video frame. We then compared results across algorithms and across autism and control groups using ANCOVA analyses while controlling for the age and sex of participating children. Results: There were significant differences in the performance of the three facial analysis algorithms including differences in the proportion of frames identified as containing a face and frames classified as containing each of the examined facial expressions. Nevertheless, analyses across all three algorithms demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the quantity of facial expressions produced by children with autism and controls. Limitations: Our study was limited to verbal children with autism who completed ADOS-2 assessments using modules 2 and 3 and were able to sit in a stable manner while facing a wall mounted camera. In addition, this study focused on comparing the quantity of facial expressions across groups rather than their quality, timing, or social context. Conclusions: Commonly used automated facial analysis algorithms exhibit large variability in their output when identifying facial expressions of young children during naturalistic social interactions. Nonetheless, all three algorithms did not identify differences in the quantity of facial expressions across groups, suggesting that atypical production of facial expressions in verbal children with autism is likely related to their quality, timing, and social context rather than their quantity during natural social interaction.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Plasticity in microclimatic niches created through the extended phenotype have been hypothesized to buffer desert-dwelling organisms from rapidly changing conditions. A unique example of the extended phenotype is the mound-burrow system of the western pebble mouse (Pseudomys chapmani), a small rodent that survives in one of Australia's harshest environments. Here, using thermo-loggers and by obtaining mound measurements, we show that the mound-burrow system provides protection from prevailing desert conditions of both searing heat and freezing cold. We show that burrow depth and the height of the parapet around the entrance help maintain stable temperatures by warming in winter and cooling in spring. Burrows also had stable humidity levels relative to external fluctuations. We conclude that this unique pebble fortress is a critical resource that allows the species to persist in an extreme environment. We then applied modelling to assess how global warming has, and may continue to, influence(d) thermoregulation and behaviour, revealing that future summers in this extreme region may require refuge at an unachievable depth.

Here we introduce this framework by deriving metrics that quantify the minimum, typical, and maximum amplification of perturbed abundances under nonequilibrium population dynamics. By simulating models under several nonequilibrium scenarios, we demonstrate that these metrics accurately characterize the full range of amplification of perturbed abundances in the short and long terms. Notably, we show that perturbation amplification depends strongly on community state in the short term, but this state dependency vanishes in the long term. Overall, our framework enables stability analysis for model and natural communities that do not exhibit equilibrium dynamics.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

This holds true in crustaceans, but if the dominants autotomize their weapon (chela/cheliped) before a second encounter, there is a decrease of potential fighting ability in the prior dominant and an increased chance of success in the prior subordinates than before. I examined whether familiar recognition is still effective even when subordinates encounter a familiar, but temporarily weaponless, dominant through two consecutive trials of male-male contests in the hermit crab Pagurus middendorffii. Subordinate P. middendorffii intruders avoid fights with a familiar dominant guarder. After establishing hierarchy and familiarity between subordinates and dominants possessing a weapon (major cheliped), the subordinates encountered the same dominants after experimentally induced autotomy of the weapon. Subordinate intruders actively fought with the familiar but weaponless guarders. This result might be explained by the subordinates updating information; that is, opponents were recognized the same but weaker than before.

However, emerging evidence also points to significant vascular impairments as a critical aspect of PD pathology, which remains largely underexplored due to the inability of traditional in vitro models to recapitulate such vascular changes. To address this unmet need, here we combine the human organ-on-a-chip technology with the principle of vasculogenic self-assembly to engineer the capillary interface of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. In our proof-of-concept demonstration, we successfully recreated critical neuronal pathology in PD, including -synuclein aggregation, inflammatory responses, and progressive neuronal degeneration, by exposing our model to specially generated PD-associated -synuclein preformed fibrils. Importantly, this engineering approach also enables the investigation of progressive vascular changes characteristic of PD, such as endothelial dysfunction, barrier disruption, and vascular regression. Our sophisticated PD model establishes a novel platform for exploring the multifaceted nature of the disease and understanding the complex interplay between neurodegeneration and vascular pathology, offering a unique tool for developing innovative therapeutic strategies that address both the neuronal and vascular components of PD pathology.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

We present a microneedle-based capacitive biosensor (MiCaP) for in situ, minimally invasive monitoring of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in interstitial fluid (ISF) for point-of-care (POC) applications. MiCaP is a label-free biosensor operating based on non-faradaic sensing by monitoring electric double layer capacitance at the microneedle-ISF interface. We extracted a simplified equivalent circuit model for MiCaP inserted into skin, confirming that the measured capacitance variations originate from cTnI binding to surface-immobilized antibodies. MiCaP was fabricated using a scalable process and functionalized with anti-cTnI antibodies. In vitro measurements showed a dynamic detection range of 10 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL, a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.27 pg/mL, and a total assay turnaround time of less than 15 minutes. A spike-and-recovery test using cTnI-spiked human serum yielded a recovery accuracy exceeding 93%. In vivo studies in rats demonstrated ISF cTnI levels of 3 pg/mL in controls and 912 pg/mL in experimental animals, indicating an increasing trend consistent with serum concentrations measured using a clinical immunoassay.

Aficamten is a second in class myosin inhibitor with promising clinical data showing improvements in hemodynamics and symptoms in patients with HCM. While it is known that Aficamten inhibits force and cardiomyocyte contractility by stabilizing the weak pre-powerstroke conformation, effects on myosin structure and kinetics during loaded contraction are lacking. Methods: Permeabilized porcine cardiac tissue and myofibrils were used for single-molecule imaging of ATP turn over, X-ray diffraction, and mechanical measurements. Engineered heart tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes were used to evaluate effects on force and contraction kinetics. Results: In contrast to Mavacamten, Aficamten does not structurally sequester myosin heads along the thick filament. Aficamten inhibits ATPase activity by shifting myosin heads from higher to slower ATPase state, with the emergence of a super slow biochemical nucleotide turnover state. This results in decreased force and calcium sensitivity without altering cross-bridge cycling. These contractile mechanical changes are comparable to Mavacamten. Our myofibril mechanical assay showed inhibition of force with accelerated relaxation. In EHTs, while Mavacamten and Aficamten inhibit cardiac twitch forces, Mavacamten reduces the activation kinetics while both result in faster relaxation. Conclusions: We used a combination of biochemical and biomechanical assays to show that Aficamten inhibits myosin ATPase without appreciably altering myosin structure. This is different from Mavacamten that strongly affects both. While both compounds inhibit contractility, differences in mechanisms of action and kinetics of force activation and relaxation could allow use in different patient populations.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

However, it is unclear if different stressors lead to similar NPQ phenotypes, and the magnitude of natural variation (between and within plant species) in NPQ response to abiotic stress is unknown. Testing a semi-high-throughput leaf-disc approach for examining the NPQ kinetics parameters, we investigated NPQ under chilling, drought and low nitrogen stress across multiple species and/or genotypes. Our results show substantial variation in NPQ phenotypes across species, genotypes and treatments. In C3 crops, tobacco and soybean, multiple NPQ parameters generally increased under chilling and drought, while in C4 crops, maize and sorghum, NPQ traits were more variable including a decrease of multiple NPQ parameters. Low-N stress revealed genotype- and developmental stage-specific effects on NPQ, potentially reflecting distinct adaptive strategies and regulatory changes in NPQ stress response. A significant effect of ecotype and stress treatment was detected on most NPQ kinetics traits in Arabidopsis thaliana, however, the interaction between ecotype and treatment was stronger in drought than in chilling. Differential regulation of NPQ could be associated with a combination of changes in proton motive, ATPase synthase activity, and PSI redox state. Our findings highlight that interpreting relative changes in NPQ under abiotic stress is inherently complex and demands a broader integration of physiological data across multiple regulatory layers.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

To address this, we mapped chromatin accessibility in corticospinal neurons across postnatal development and found two distinct waves of restriction, an early, partial closure between P0 to P4, followed by a stronger, more widespread restriction from P7 into adulthood. We also asked whether the distance of injury influences chromatin remodeling and found that distal (thoracic) injuries triggered only modest changes, while proximal (intracortical) injuries led to much broader accessibility shifts, pointing to injury proximity as a key factor in epigenetic responsiveness. We then tested whether this restricted chromatin could be reopened by introducing PATZ1, a transcription factor normally expressed during early postnatal growth. AAV based delivery of PATZ1 after injury caused marked chromatin remodeling, including an 11.6 fold increase in H3K27ac at growth-relevant sites and large-scale reorganization of 3D genome structure, with compartment shifts toward active states and altered TAD boundaries. These changes were accompanied by reactivation of gene networks linked to developmental growth.

In this study, we investigated the role of C1 adrenergic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLMC1) in the short-term BP regulation during sleep-wake transitions and physical activity in freely behaving rats. Using genetically targeted fiber photometry, we show that RVLMC1 neurons exhibit state-dependent activity, with rapid activation during arousal from non-REM sleep, sustained activity in REM sleep, and further recruitment during physical activity. We further demonstrate that baroreflex input is essential for the dynamic response of RVLMC1 neurons to pharmacological manipulations of BP and transitions to REM sleep. Strikingly, selective ablation of RVLMC1 neurons did not affect mean BP but caused pronounced instability during arousal and movement, underscoring their role in buffering BP fluctuations. These findings demonstrate that RVLMC1 neurons integrate arousal-related central drive with baroreceptor feedback to stabilize BP during changes in behavioral state. These findings suggest that the disruption of RVLMC1 neurons could underlie increased BP variability observed in pathological conditions, such as multiple system atrophy, even when mean BP is preserved.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

For example, people tend to remember items as occurring farther apart in time if they spanned a change in context, or 'event boundary,' compared to the same context. While these distortions can sacrifice precise timing, they may serve to help separate temporally adjacent memories. However, the neural bases of this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 32) with eye-tracking (n = 28) to test whether the dopaminergic system, known to influence encoding and time perception, predicts time dilation between adjacent events in memory. Participants encoded item sequences while listening to tones that mostly repeated over time, forming a stable auditory context, but occasionally switched, creating an event boundary. We found that boundaries predicted greater retrospective estimates of time between item pairs. Critically, tone switches significantly activated the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key midbrain dopaminergic region, and these responses in turn predicted greater time dilation between item pairs spanning those switches. Boundaries furthermore predicted a momentary increase in blinks. VTA activation also predicted blinking in general, consistent with the idea that blink behavior is a potential marker of dopaminergic activity. On a larger timescale, higher blink rates predicted greater time dilation in memory, but only for boundary-spanning pairs. Together, these findings suggest that dopaminergic processes are sensitive to event structure and may drive temporal distortions that help disjoin memories of distinct events.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

While the mutation had minor effects in PsbA1-PSII, the S264V mutation in PsbA3-PSII had significant consequences: i) thermoluminescence data show inefficient electron transfer from QA- to QB; ii) re-oxidation of QA- was slowed, by at least a factor of 10; iii) the herbicides inhibit weakly O2 evolution; iv) no Fe2+QB- EPR signal was detected in dark-adapted PSII; instead, v) a large Fe3+ signal was present with vi) modified EPR properties; vii) no QA-Fe2+QB- biradical signal was observed after illumination at 198 K following a flash illumination, confirming the inefficient formation of QB-; viii) either no proton uptake coupled to non-heme iron reduction occurred or with a very slow rate compared to PsbA3-PSII; ix) changes were noted in the electrochromic response associated with QA- formation; and x) increased production of singlet oxygen, both with and without herbicides. The S264V mutation in PsbA3-PSII leads to a significant decrease in the energy gap between the QA-QB and QAQB- states. The effects listed above are discussed regarding the differences between PsbA1-PSII and PsbA3-PSII as those related to the sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, the water molecules and the H-bond network.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

A.; Taylor, E.; McQueen, B.

The need for improved therapeutics is urgent. Animal models utilized for drug development are limited by interspecies variability and poor translatability. However, most in vitro models lack the sophistication to model the key interplay of the immune system with the intestinal epithelium in line with the known role of the immune system in the etiology of the disease. To address this gap, we developed a primary intestinal epithelial cell co-culture system to incorporate elements of innate immune signaling. This system models immune-epithelial interactions using RepliGut(R) - Planar Transverse Colon cultured on a Transwell system with THP-1 derived macrophages in a receiver compartment of a 96-well plate. Epithelial barrier integrity and cell viability were maintained in co-culture with unstimulated macrophages. However, similar to the pathology associated with IBD, epithelial integrity was compromised in co-culture with LPS + IFN{gamma} pre-stimulated macrophages as evidenced by declining TEER and cell viability and increased inflammatory cytokine release. Cotreatment with anti-inflammatory IBD therapeutics adalimumab or tofacitinib mitigated these effects, demonstrating the model's ability to replicate key inflammatory responses and prevention. Reproducibility and scalability of the model system further position the model for high-throughput screening of anti-inflammatory drugs, improving drug discovery, and accelerating the translation of new IBD therapies into clinical practice.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Despite intensive therapies, outcomes for high-risk pediatric brain tumors (PBTs) remain dismal, prompting the search for novel treatments. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) have been shown to prime tumors to improve response to checkpoint inhibition. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of decitabine (DAC), in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, to improve survival in pediatric high-risk brain tumor models. Methods. Analysis of human PBT datasets was performed to determine gene expression levels of immune cell associated markers. Tumor response to DAC, with or without a PD-1 inhibitor, was tested in murine models representing H3-wildtype diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), H3K27-mutant diffuse midline glioma (DMG), atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), and medulloblastoma (MB). CyTOF analysis of allograft tumors was performed to characterize changes within the tumor microenvironment. Results. Analysis of PBT subtypes revealed heterogeneous expression of immune cell markers, checkpoint receptors, and MHC molecules. DAC treatment decreased DNA methylation and increased neoantigen expression in human and mouse tumor cells. DAC alone or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor resulted in prolonged survival in syngeneic mouse models of DIPG and ATRT but not DMG and MB models. CyTOF analysis of mouse tumors revealed changes in local immune cell infiltration upon combination treatment. Conclusions. DAC in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor can alter the immune microenvironment in mouse tumor models. Changes were observed in H3-wildtype DIPG and ATRT models, suggesting that certain tumor subtypes may respond to checkpoint blockade after immune augmentation with DNMTi.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

This approach is not scalable by automation, not effective for non-immunogenic or toxic antigens, and prevents the use of modified scaffolds for altered pharmacokinetic properties. Synthetic libraries allow for pre-selection of a single domain framework tailored to its intended downstream use. One area of interest for these biologic vectors is radiopharmaceuticals. Ideal radiopharmaceutical pharmacokinetic properties differ from most traditional therapeutics, as short plasma circulation and rapid kidney clearance are necessary to avoid dose-limiting organ radiation. Although there are a growing number of nanobody radiopharmaceuticals in clinical trials, their frameworks and corresponding pharmacokinetic properties vary. One potential method for improving the development of novel single domain antibody radiopharmaceuticals is through synthetic libraries based on nanobodies with proven clinically acceptable pharmacokinetics. We developed a modular synthetic nanobody phage display vector based on the scaffold of the 2Rs15d nanobody that allows for manipulation of the binding and framework regions. Using this vector, we created a library of nanobodies with a randomized CDR2 containing over 1.7 million unique sequences per microliter. As a proof-of-concept, we panned the library for nanobodies binding calreticulin (CALR), a protein critical in immunogenic cell death. One isolated clone, Cal3, has a measured affinity of 140 nM for CALR and is cross-reactive with mouse and human CALR. Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the radiolabeled 64Cu-NOTA-Cal3 demonstrated CALR binding in vivo, representing the first reported synthetic nanobody characterized by PET imaging.

Previous studies have demonstrated that PSGL-1 acts as an HIV restriction factor, blocking HIV infectivity by hindering particle attachment to target cells. A large part of PSGL-1's extracellular region consists of a mucin-like domain, characterized by decameric repeats (DR), which comprise 14 to 16 DR tandems. Each DR is composed of 10 consensus amino acids (-A-T/M-E-A-Q-T-T-X-P/L-A/T-) and is notably rich in O-glycosylated threonines (30%) and prolines (10%). A proposed function of the DR is to elongate the protein backbone needed for selectin binding. However, the precise role of DR in PSGL-1's antiviral mechanisms has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we performed DR deletion mutagenesis and molecular modeling, systematically deleting from one DR to all DRs, and quantified their effects on PSGL-1's antiviral functions. Here, we demonstrate that DR is necessary for PSGL-1's antiviral activity. Deleting DR did not affect virion incorporation of PSGL-1, but diminished PSGL-1's ability to hinder virion attachment to target cells. We also discovered that individual single DR mutants retained 3.5 to 18% of the antiviral activity exhibited by full-length PSGL-1, and the basic antiviral activity of DR is cumulative; increasing the number of DRs correlates with heightened antiviral activity. Additionally, the intrinsic anti-HIV capability of DR was found to be transferrable; inserting the DR domain into the extracellular Ig-like domain of CD2 permitted the hybrid CD2-DR molecules to partially acquire the anti-HIV properties of PSGL-1. Further molecular modeling utilizing all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations highlighted a structure-function relationship between the anti-HIV potency of DR and the elongation of the DR backbone, as measured by DR backbone dihedral angles ({phi}) and the radial distributions of peptide atom number density (r max). These results collectively suggest that DR serves as an essential antiviral unit within the framework of PSGL-1's restriction mechanism against HIV.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Temporal fluctuations in zinc concentrations drive reproductive milestones such as meiotic resumption, egg activation, and initiation of the mitotic cell cycle. Roles for zinc in late preimplantation embryo development, have not been well characterized. Using a quantitative element approach we report the inorganic profiles of mouse embryos progressing through the late blastocyst stage. We find that blastocysts, like oocytes and eggs, and distinct to somatic cells, maintain higher levels of zinc than copper and iron. All three of these essential metals are more abundant in the inner cell mass, which contains the population of pluripotent stem cells that give rise to the fetus, relative to the trophectoderm which gives rise to the placenta and extraembryonic tissues. To test whether zinc abundance was associated with mitotic progress and cell fate lineage, we perturbed zinc homeostasis during blastocyst formation by artificially raising intracellular zinc concentrations with zinc pyrithione. This treatment during the morula-to-blastocyst transition when cell fate lineages emerge resulted in an elevation of zinc in the ICM. This treatment did not impact cell number, but did increase expression of the pluripotency and epiblast marker, Nanog, and decreased expression of the primitive endoderm marker, Gata4. These results demonstrate that the inorganic profiles of the late preimplantation embryo retain elemental hallmarks of earlier developmental stages and perturbation of zinc levels alters pluripotency gene expression in the blastocyst.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Despite this clinical reality, age-related immune decline is rarely considered in preclinical testing. Therefore, novel in vitro models to test cancer vaccine efficacy, considering immunosenescence, are needed. Our novel lymph node paracortex on-a-chip (LNPoC) platform addresses this gap by recapitulating age-dependent immune responses against cancer vaccines, specifically antigen presentation, antigen-specific T cell activation, and antitumoral responses. Using this platform, we demonstrated that bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from young mice (6-7 weeks) displayed significantly enhanced ovalbumin (OVA) peptide presentation compared to APCs from older mice (35-36 weeks). This age-dependent difference translated to significantly greater OVA-specific CD8+ T cell activation and increased cytotoxicity against B16-OVA cancer cells. These age-dependent differences are unique to our LNPoC and undetectable in traditional 2D cultures, confirming that our LNPoC was more effective than 2D cultures at recapitulating immunosenescence-mediated immune responses against cancer vaccines in vitro. The in vivo validation confirms these findings, as young mice demonstrated higher OVA-specific CD8+ T cell responses and smaller tumors than older mice. Our LNPoC is a valuable tool for assessing immunosenescence's impact on cancer vaccines, potentially guiding more effective therapies for older adults.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

In this study, we quantified the impact of E2 on cell shape and actin dynamics in 12Z human endometriotic epithelial cells transfected with LifeAct-GFP and observed with lattice lightsheet microscopy, a new imaging technique fast enough to capture 3D dynamics on second timescales. E2, when applied for 24 hours, significantly decreased cell circularity, solidity, and rate of change of circularity, indicating a transition to a more elongated and less variable morphology. 24-hour E2 treatment also induced the formation of large membrane protrusions reminiscent of invadopodia and led to a more disordered flow of actin within those protrusions. However, these effects were not seen after 15 minutes of E2 treatment, suggesting that longer-term signaling is required to drive these structural changes. Together, these results suggest that E2 modulates actin polymerization and membrane protrusion dynamics in endometriotic epithelial cells and may prime them for cell invasion.

H.; Gopalakrishnan, V.", "abstract": "Regulation of gene expression is fundamental for proper cellular function, and is constrained by the local chromatin environment of each gene, which varies spatially along the chromosome and is shaped by epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic modifications induce changes in the local chromatin structure, which can influence gene expression, by affecting the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. Such changes are particularly relevant in aging and genetic disorders like Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and Werner Syndrome (WRN), where altered chromatin structure contributes to disease pathology. In this study, we analyze RNA-seq data using macroscopic metrics designed to be explicitly sensitive to chromatin modifications. The first metric, intra-chromosomal gene correlation length, measures spatial correlations in gene expressions along the chromosome. The second metric employs an energy landscape model based on the Arrhenius equation to estimate the energetic barriers associated with chromatin state transitions. We apply these metrics to various aging-related datasets, demonstrating their sensitivity to changes in the chromatin structure and the interpretability of the resulting outputs. The intra-chromosomal gene correlation length is particularly effective in quantifying changes in RNA-seq profiles due to increased chromatin accessibility during aging (and conversely, reduced accessibility due to treatment). This metric not only accurately distinguishes cell states, but also provides insight into the direction of aging. For instance, our observations on the effects of anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment align with the existing literature, demonstrating that ASO partially restores chromatin structure in diseased cells. They additionally quantify the more pronounced effects in HGPS compared to WRN. The barrier energy landscape further extends this capability by offering a framework for understanding the progressive degradation of the regulatory mechanisms. Together, these metrics provide robust screening tools that enhance our ability to exploit common measurements such as RNA-seq to derive new phenotypes such as chromatin dynamics on aging and disease, offering an alternative perspective that complements traditional analytical techniques and enriches our understanding of cellular states.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

In mammals, DNA methylation in regulatory regions, such as promoters, primarily regulates gene expression by inducing transcriptional inactivation. With genome-wide approaches came the realization that DNA methylation patterns underlying mammalian development are considerably more dynamic than previously recognized. This realization highlights the need for methodological approaches capable of capturing this phenomenon. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of modeling DNA methylation networks by jointly estimating regularized precision matrices from time- and tissue-specific omics data derived from the pig genome. For that, we utilized RNA-Seq and RRBS data that span seven pig tissues at three developmental stages: early organogenesis, late organogenesis, and newborn. Our analysis focused on 61, 48, and 74 genes -- differentially expressed across developmental stages and CpG-methylated in promoter regions, from endoderm-, mesoderm-, and ectoderm-derived tissues, respectively. Using a joint fused ridge approach, we were able to borrow information across tissues and time points, enabling more robust network inference. This analytical framework advances exploratory methods for studying organism development using pig as a model species.

The recent realization of image scanning microscopy (ISM) using confocal spinning disks (CSD) enhanced the spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopy to twice the diffraction limit with minimal sample perturbation and fast acquisition rates. However, capturing multi-color images using ISM is still time-consuming and introduces temporal artifacts as different colors are not acquired simultaneously. Here, we present a spectral CSD-ISM system designed for concurrent high-resolution and simultaneous multi-color acquisition. By integrating a custom linear Amici prism into the CSD-ISM optical detection path, we achieve multi-color, super-resolution images at a fraction of the acquisition time and with a flexible color palette selection. A digital signal processor (DSP) is employed together with accompanying software as a cost-effective alternative to Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) used in previous studies. We provide an accompanying GPU-compatible, python-based image processing pipeline to decompose spectral signatures into multi-color channel-based images, preserving the optical resolution. System characterization using three color fluorescent beads demonstrated 1.74-fold resolution improvement over the diffraction limit and accurate color classification with three times faster acquisition compared to standard CSD-ISM. Application to neuron cells expressing a Parkinson's disease-associated mutation, showcased improved resolution and contrast of four distinctly labeled cellular components. This spectral CSD-ISM system provides a valuable tool for biological imaging, enabling the simultaneous acquisition of high-resolution spatial information and multi-color spectral data.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

N.; Spielmann, H. P.; Blackburn, J. S.", "abstract": "Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver 3 (PRL-3) is frequently upregulated in cancer and associated with poor prognosis, yet its oncogenic mechanism remains unresolved. Although traditionally studied for its phosphatase activity, PRL-3 also engages in protein-protein interactions via its catalytic site, notably binding the CNNM magnesium transporters, rendering these functions mutually exclusive. The commonly used C104S mutant disrupts both activities, confounding interpretations of prior studies. To dissect the distinct functions of PRL-3, we employed mutants selectively deficient in phosphatase activity (C104D) or CNNM binding (R138E). In zebrafish models of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), as well as in human cancer cell lines, both wild-type PRL-3 and C104D enhanced tumor initiation, growth, and dissemination, while R138E had no effect. These findings indicate that PRL-3 promotes cancer via non-catalytic mechanisms. To support therapeutic development, we established an in vitro FRET-based assay to screen for inhibitors of the PRL-3:CNNM interaction and validated a cyclic peptide as a positive control. By demonstrating that PRL-3 enhances cancer progression independently of its catalytic activity, this study shifts focus toward targeting its binding functions as a therapeutic strategy.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

While t-NEPC typically arises from adenocarcinoma through neuroendocrine transdifferentiation after androgen pathway inhibition, the temporal dynamics and molecular drivers of this process remain poorly understood. Here, utilizing the first-in-field patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of adenocarcinoma-to-NEPC transdifferentiation (LTL331/331R), we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic sequencing (scRNA-seq) across seven timepoints spanning pre-castration to relapsed NEPC. Our analysis demonstrated 15 distinct cell clusters, including twelve adenocarcinoma clusters and two NEPC clusters (ASCL1high/FOXA2low and ASCL1low/FOXA2high clusters). Notably, we revealed a newly-discovered, early intermediate transitional cell state during t-NEPC development distinguished by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stem cell-related, metabolically active, and HDAC-associated regulatory signatures. Analysis of this intermediate transitional cluster led to the identification of RUNX1T1 as a pivotal transcriptional regulator of NEPC transdifferentiation. Functionally, RUNX1T1 overexpression promoted AR pathway inhibition (ARPI) -induced NE transdifferentiation and increased resistance to ARPI treatment in prostate adenocarcinoma. RUNX1T1 knockdown reverses the NE transdifferentiation, inhibits NEPC cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. In summary, this study identifies a critical intermediate transitional cell state during t-NEPC development and reveals the heterogeneity of terminal NEPC, offering new insights into NEPC biology and emphasizing the importance of early intervention. Moreover, the discovery of RUNX1T1 as a key early driver active in both the initial and terminal phases of NEPC progression presents promising opportunities for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

In rodents, NASPM is known to suppress seizures in vivo and seizure-like events (SLE) in vitro, suggesting possible involvement of CP-AMPAR in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. To address whether these findings can be translated to human brain, we investigated the involvement of glutamatergic receptor subclasses in SLE in human cortex ex vivo, demonstrating that glutamatergic receptor antagonists can block (NASPM and APV) or reduce (UBP302, GYKI52466, GYKI53655) SLE. Using a multimethodological approach we were able to demonstrate that both NASPM and APV inhibit human SLE by inhibition of NMDA receptors. Our results further show that the inhibitory effect of NASPM on NMDA receptors is sufficient to explain its inhibition of seizure like activity, rather than its action on CP-AMPA receptors. Thus, our findings challenge previous knowledge on the use of NASPM as a specific CP-AMPAR inhibitor. Some phenomena previously attributed to CP-AMPAR, may need to be re-examined more closely. Overall, our study raises awareness about potential pitfalls in the use of existing pharmacological agents and sets a new paradigm for the use of NASPM in neuroscience research while questioning its therapeutic potential in a clinical context.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

We evaluated environmental factors including geographic location, incubation regime (indoor/outdoor), and exposure conditions (UV radiation, temperature, and salinity) as potential drivers shaping microbial communities. Our results demonstrate clear differentiation in microbial community structure driven primarily by transect location and environmental conditions, rather than material type.

The two components are the sensor kinase (SK), which senses the signal and autophosphorylates on a histidine residue, and a response regulator (RR), which is phosphorylated by the kinase and modifies gene expression. Despite intensive study, the mechanisms of signal sensing by sensor kinases are incompletely defined and the mechanisms by which SKs can sense multiple ligands are unclear. Mycobacterium tuberculosis PdtaS/PdtaR is a soluble TCS pair that participates in the Rip1 signal transduction cascade to control virulence by responding to copper and nitric oxide (NO). In contrast to paradigmatic ligand activated SKs, PdtaS is constitutively active without ligand and directly inhibited by Cu or NO, but it is unclear how such chemically diverse ligands are sensed. Here we show that PdtaS is a dimeric kinase that constitutively autophosphorylates in trans. Cu and NO both inhibit PdtaS phosphorylation by inhibiting dimerization. Phylogenetic analysis of the PdtaS family reveals conservation of the PAS/GAF dimer interface rather than the ligand binding pockets and mutations in the GAF dimer interface that alter dimerization impair multi-ligand sensing both in vitro and in M. tuberculosis cells.

In humans, SETD2 is the only known enzyme that catalyzes H3K36me3 in somatic cells and is implicated in tumor suppression across multiple cancer types. While there is considerable crosstalk between the SETD2-H3K36me3 axis and other epigenetic modifications, much remains to be understood. Here, we show that SETD2 functions as a potent tumor suppressor in a KRASG12C-driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mouse model, and that acetylation at H3K27 (H3K27ac) enhances SETD2 in vitro methylation of H3K36 on nucleosome substrates. In vivo, SETD2 ablation accelerates lethality in an autochthonous KRASG12C-driven LUAD mouse tumor model. Biochemical analyses reveal that polyacetylation of histone tails in a nucleosome context promote H3K36 methylation by SETD2. In addition, monoacetylation exerts position-specific effects, such as H3K27ac stimulating SETD2 methylation activity. In contrast, mono-ubiquitination at various histone sites, including at H2AK119 and H2BK120, does not affect SETD2 methylation of nucleosomes. Together, these findings provide insight into how SETD2 integrates histone modification signals to regulate H3K36 methylation and highlights the potential role of SETD2-associated epigenetic crosstalk in cancer pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Knowledge of species' geographic distributions is essential to wildlife conservation and management. A great deal of research has developed predictive models that reveal complex spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of species' occurrence probabilities. However, binary maps of the geographic limits of species occurrence (\"range maps\") are still used in conservation assessments, decision making, and as a component of the species distribution modelling process itself. Organizations that create and revise range maps face numerous challenges. For example, different types of data must often be combined to fill knowledge gaps. Range delineation is labor intensive and subjective in ways that hinder transparency and repeatability. I developed a framework for transparent and repeatable range maps in support of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Gap Analysis Project. The framework has an explicit conceptual foundation that supports a compilation process built with open-source technologies and freely available data. As a case study, I mapped Fisher Pekania pennanti range and presence between 2021 and 2025 for the conterminous United States by compiling information from a range map circa 2001, 2,287 species occurrence records from 16 datasets, and 17 scientific publications. The maps depict presence and range according to levels of evidence. The justification for classification of each spatial unit is included in the output. The maps revealed that translocations and emigration have expanded the species' range in some areas, but the species is suspected to be absent from some areas previously considered range. The framework overcomes several challenges, but some components of the process warrant further development, such as occurrence record evaluation and direct incorporation of predictions from species distribution models.

This mutation-selection-drift-balance (MSDB) shapes the prevalence of a disease and its genetic architecture. To date, however, MSDB has only been modeled for monogenic (Mendelian) diseases. Here, we develop a MSDB model for complex disease susceptibility: we assume that genotype relates to disease risk according to the canonical liability threshold model and that selection on variants affecting risk derives from the fitness cost of the disease, and focus on diseases that are highly polygenic, entail a substantial fitness cost, and are neither extremely common in the population nor exceedingly rare. Contrasting model predictions with GWAS and other findings in humans suggests that directional selection plays little role in shaping common genetic variation affecting complex disease susceptibility but might substantially affect rare, large effect variation. In turn, common variation affecting complex disease susceptibility appears to be dominated by pleiotropic stabilizing selection on other traits. Our results further suggest that current estimates of disease heritability are likely biased. More generally, our model provides a better understanding of the evolutionary processes that shape the architecture and prevalence of complex diseases.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

These biogenic VOCs exhibit significant chemical diversity, with terpenoids being the dominant group, and isoprene accounting for nearly half of the total biogenic VOCs. Due to its high chemical reactivity, isoprene has a strong impact on atmospheric quality and climate. Quercus species (Fagaceae) are known to be the main isoprene emitters in the Northern Hemisphere. However, isoprene synthase is unknown in the entire Fagaceae family. Notably, even within a single genus such as Quercus, both isoprene-emitting and non-emitting species are present, yet the molecular basis of this dichotomy remains unclear. Here, we report the identification of the IspS gene from the isoprene-emitting species Quercus serrata (QsIspS1) through seasonal transcriptome analysis and its detailed biochemical characterization. We also identified two genes with high sequence similarity to QsIspS1 in the genomes of non-emitting species: Q. glauca (QgIspS1-like) and Lethocarpus edulis (LeIspS1-like). We discovered mutations in these sequences that likely impair their function. Biochemical analysis revealed that QgIspS1-like is a monoterpene synthase, whereas LeIspS1-like is a pseudogene incapable of isoprene synthesis, explaining these plants' inability to emit isoprene. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis revealed an amino acid that plays a pivotal role in the substrate and product specificities of isoprene synthase.

As pregnancy progresses, the cervix becomes more compliant and eventually opens in late pregnancy to facilitate childbirth. This dual function is facilitated by extensive remodeling of the cervical extracellular matrix (ECM), giving rise to its complex time-dependent material properties. Premature cervical remodeling is known to result in preterm birth, defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation. While previous work has studied cervical remodeling using various biomechanical methods, it remains unclear how the intrinsic or flow-independent viscoelastic behavior of the cervix is influenced by cervical remodeling. In this study, an anisotropic reactive viscoelastic material model was formulated and investigated under tensile deformation to understand material behavior in cervical remodeling. To calibrate the model, experimental force relaxation data was used from uniaxial tension tests on Rhesus macaque cervical specimens from four gestational time points. The results showed that cervical tissue equilibrium and instantaneous stiffness significantly decreased from the non-pregnant to the late pregnancy status. In addition, cervical tissue in the late third trimester relaxed faster to equilibrium than the other gestational groups, particularly at prescribed tensile strains greater than 30%. This fast relaxation to equilibrium helps the cervix dissipate tensile hoop stresses induced by the fetus during labor, preventing its rupture.

The interaction between tropomyosin and actin is quite unique: single tropomyosin dimers bind weakly to actin filaments but get stabilised by end-to-end attachment with neighbouring tropomyosin dimers, forming clusters which wrap around the filament. Force spectroscopy is a powerful approach for studying protein-protein interactions, but classical methods which usually pull with pN forces on a single protein pair, are not well adapted to tropomyosins. Here, we propose a method in which a hydrodynamic drag force is applied directly to the proteins of interest, by imposing a controlled fluid flow inside a microfluidic chamber. The breaking of the protein bonds is directly visualised with fluorescence microscopy. Using this approach, we reveal that very low forces from 0.01 to 0.1 pN per tropomyosin dimer trigger the detachment of entire tropomyosin clusters from actin filaments. We show that the tropomyosin cluster detachment rate depends on the cytoplasmic tropomyosin isoform (Tpm1.6, 1.7, 1.8) and increases exponentially with the applied force. These observations lead us to propose a cluster detachment model which suggests that tropomyosins dynamically explore different positions over the actin filament. Our experimental setup can be used with many other cytoskeletal proteins, and we show, as a proof-of-concept, that the velocity of myosin-X motors is reduced by an opposing fluid flow.

Then, we performed targeted analyses of laminar organization, spike amplitude, multichannel spatial features, functional properties, and network connectivity of these cell classes, to discover four fundamental aspects of the V1 microcircuit predicted by anatomical studies, but never fully demonstrated before in vivo: First, NS neurons were most concentrated in layer 4 and more numerous than parvalbumin positive neurons, consistent with studies of potassium channel expression in excitatory neurons in V1. Second, a large amplitude NS cell class in layer 4B was strongly direction selective, with multichannel waveforms consistent with a stellate morphology, which is a likely functional correlate of anatomical descriptions of neurons that project between V1 and MT. Third, an NS cell class in layer 4B showed robust bursting activity and strong orientation selectivity.

A massive bloom of the oil-degrading bacterium, Oleispira (>80% relative abundance), coincided with the algal bloom raising questions about hydrocarbon exposure. The sea-ice algal bloom was dominated by diatoms, particularly Nitzschia spp., and transitioned into a flagellate dominated post-bloom community which aligned with melt-associated irradiance increase and nutrient flushing. We explored the relationship between putative parasitoids, Chytridiomycetes, Thecofilosea (Cercozoa), Oomycetes, Syndiniales (Dinoflagellata), and Labyrinthulomycetes (Bigyra), and potential microalgal hosts. Chytrids peaked periodically suggesting synchronized infections and Cryothecomonas (Thecofilosea) was observed parasitizing Nitzschia spp. for the first time in Arctic sea ice. Co-occurrence analysis suggested that diatoms, especially Nitzschia, were the primary hosts of Arctic parasitoids, and that top-down parasitoid control may dramatically alter community composition over short timescales, such as days. These results provide important insights into the drivers of vernal bloom timing and maintenance of microalgal diversity in sea ice.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Metabolic profiling of an organic extract from cultures of B. oklahomensis LMG 23618T using UHPLC-ESI-Q-ToF-MS led to identification of three known metabolites, betulinan A, yersiniabactin and ulbactin B, in addition to a novel polycholorinated compound. Mass-directed purification enabled isolation of the novel specialized metabolite, which was shown by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopic analysis to be 4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3',5,5'-tetrachlorobenzophenone. Feeding experiments with stable isotope-labelled precursors established that the carbon skeleton of this unusual metabolite derives from two molecules of tyrosine. This led us to propose a plausible biosynthetic pathway via decarboxylative condensation of 3, 5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoic acid with its coenzyme A thioester derivative.

Dietary interventions including polyphenol-rich foods offer a promising complementary option for obesity amelioration, but their efficacy is dependent on specific gut microbial metabolism and the underlying molecular mechanisms mostly remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that dietary elderberry (Eld) extract abrogates the effects of an obesogenic diet in a gut microbiota-dependent manner, by preventing insulin resistance and reducing hepatic steatosis in mice. We developed a targeted, quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for detection of gut bacterial polyphenol catabolites and identified hydrocinnamic acid as a key microbial metabolite, enriched in the portal vein plasma of Eld supplemented animals. Next, we showed that hydrocinnamic acid potently activates hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase , explaining its role in improved liver lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, we uncovered the metabolic pathway cumulating in hydrocinnamic acid production in the common gut commensal Clostridium sporogenes. Our characterization of hydrocinnamic acid as a diet-derived, and microbiota-dependent metabolite with insulin-sensitizing and anti-steatotic activities will contribute to microbiome-targeted dietary interventions to prevent and treat obesity-associated metabolic diseases.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

We previously reported that mutations in the viral nucleocapsid (NC) are selected in the presence of the INSTI dolutegravir (DTG) and confer levels of INSTI resistance comparable to those conferred by clinically relevant IN mutations. Here we show that these NC mutations accelerate the kinetics of viral DNA integration. The shortened time frame between the completion of reverse transcription and integration correlates with reduced sensitivity to DTG, suggesting that NC mutations limit the window of opportunity for INSTIs to block viral DNA integration. We find that in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 acquires mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, NC, and occasionally IN during selection for INSTI resistance. Notably, the selected NC and IN mutations act in concert to reduce the susceptibility of the virus to INSTIs.

Despite its prevalence, TMJ-OA remains understudied. This study aimed to investigate the transcriptional signature of the TMJ compared to that of the knee joint and to explore transcriptional differences in the medial and superficial layers of the TMJ-OA. Design: Six-month-old C57BL/6J mice TMJ and knee samples were collected. Goat TMJ superficial and medial layer cartilage was separated and treated with IL-1{beta}. All samples were subjected to bulk RNA sequencing followed by differential expression and gene set enrichment analysis. Results: We identified 4,031 protein-coding genes differentially expressed in the TMJ compared to the knee, with significant enrichment of neuronal system genes and lower enrichment of innate immune system genes. Key osteoarthritis biomarkers such as Mmp13, Postn, and Col1a1 were more highly expressed in the TMJ, indicating a higher vulnerability to OA development. IL-1{beta} treatment in goat TMJ chondrocytes mimicked the natural TMJ-OA-like transcriptional changes and immune responses, which are also observed in the rabbit TMJ-OA model. This validated the in vitro goat TMJ-OA model. The IL-1{beta}-treated goat TMJ medial cartilage layer was enriched in OA-associated transcription factors (TFs), senescence genes, and epigenetic regulators. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the unique transcriptomic signature of the TMJ compared with the knee joint, highlighting its vulnerability to OA and pain. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of TMJ and offer a resource for potential therapeutic target selection for TMJ-OA treatment.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that TERRA transcription is driven by CpG island promoters that are composed by stretches of three types of repeats. Using the human genome assembly that was available at that time, putative promoter sequences were localized at several subtelomeres. In this work, using the T2T-CHM13v2.0 human reference genome, we found that 39 out of 46 subtelomeres contain TERRA promoters and grouped them in classes depending on their organization. The sequence of subtelomeric promoters was variable in different reference genomes suggesting that they are polymorphic in the human population. We then discovered 106 intrachromosomal TERRA-like promoters, adjacent to interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs) or far away from them. Fortyseven of these promoters are flanked and may regulate the transcription of coding genes, ncRNAs or pseudogenes. Comparative sequence analysis showed that interstitial and subtelomeric promoters belong to a previously undescribed family of segmental duplications deriving from common ancestral sequences. RT-PCR experiments in seven cell lines demonstrated that TERRA transcripts can be synthesized from ITSs. TERRA expression was always low in primary fibroblasts and HeLa cells while highly variable in the other two telomerase positive (HT1080 and HEK293) and in the three telomerase negative ALT cell lines (GM847, U2OS and VA13). Given the large number of ITSs in the human genome, we propose that these loci contribute significantly to the production of the TERRA pool.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

Many stem cell types display low mutation rates, with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) being a notable example. The bases for this property are unclear but may be achieved by optimization of various processes including high-fidelity DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint controls, and hypersensitivity to genotoxic insults that trigger cell death. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the unique responses of mouse ESCs (mESCs) to replication stress (RS) using an array of small molecule inhibitors and genotoxins. We find that whereas mESCs survive under acute RS in an ATR- and CHK1-dependent manner similar to somatic cells, they lack a strong G2/M checkpoint and fail to repair DNA crosslinks in the absence of ATR signaling. Despite the lack of a strong G2/M checkpoint, mESCs maintain a spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). We posit that mESCs preferentially repair DNA crosslinks in S phase via homology-directed mechanisms, and cells that fail to complete repair before mitosis undergo mitotic catastrophe and cell death. These findings shed light on mutation avoidance mechanisms in ESCs that may extend to other stem cell types.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

The primary end products of indigestible carbohydrate fermentation are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We hypothesized that increased dietary fiber consumption could lead to greater SCFA production in the human gut. To investigate this, we examined the relationship between complex carbohydrate intake, CAZyme activity in the human gut microbiome, and SCFA production at the whole metagenomic level across three cohorts: a healthy reference-controlled cohort, an average cohort of individuals living in industrialized cities, and a cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were utilized to assess the diversity, abundance, and functionality of CAZymes, as well as the metabolic capacity for SCFA production. The average cohort exhibited higher alpha diversity of CAZyme families compared to the reference-controlled cohort, although subfamily composition was similar between both. A moderate negative correlation was identified between CAZyme abundance and SCFA production, indicating that a higher number of these enzymes does not directly translate to increased SCFA synthesis. In IBD patients, a decrease in the diversity and composition of CAZyme subfamilies was observed, suggesting a disruption in enzymatic functions associated with the disease. However, the overall functionality of CAZymes remained relatively stable across different health conditions, highlighting the resilience of the gut microbiome for these functions. These findings deepen our understanding of the gut microbiome role in health and disease, emphasizing that despite variations in microbial diversity, key enzymatic functions persist. The study underscores the complexity of the non-linear relationship between complex carbohydrate metabolism and SCFA production, laying the groundwork for future research on microbiome-targeted therapeutic/dietary profile interventions in both non-disease and chronic diseases conditions.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

This study aims to elucidate the role of the uORF in the 5' UTR of the Gata4 (GATA binding protein 4) gene in cardiac biology by inactivating its start codon ({Delta}uORF) in the mouse genome. Our investigation reveals that mice with Gata4 uORF inactivation manifest spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy without apparent fibrosis as they age. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), we uncovered significant transcriptional variations between wild-type (WT) and {Delta}ORF mice. Notably, mRNAs associated with sarcomeres and contractile functions show heightened expression levels, reflecting the hypertrophic phenotype. Notably, at least nine upregulated genes are GATA4-bound targets in mouse ventricles. Functional assessments of isolated primary adult cardiomyocytes confirmed enhanced hypertrophy and contractility in {Delta}ORF mice. Additionally, we employed single-nucleus transposase-accessible chromatin (snATAC)-seq to investigate changes in chromatin accessibility. Our results indicated increased accessibility within specific transcription-regulatory elements linked to elevated gene transcription. These putative cis-regulatory elements (pCREs) are significantly enriched in MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2) binding motifs. In vitro luciferase reporter assays further supported the regulatory potential of three of these pCREs, highlighting their role in the transcriptional enhancement of three GATA4 target genes bound by MEF2 and GATA4.

This is typically done by generating an assembly from the sequencing reads of a bacterial isolate and running AMR gene detection tools on the assembly. However, despite advances in long-read sequencing that have greatly improved the quality and completeness of bacterial genome assemblies, assembly tools remain prone to large-scale errors caused by repeats in the genome, leading to inaccurate detection of AMR gene content and consequent impact on resistance prediction. In this work we present Amira, a tool to detect AMR genes directly from unassembled long-read sequencing data. Amira leverages the fact that multiple consecutive genes lie within a single read to construct gene-space de Bruijn graphs where the k-mer alphabet is the set of genes in the pan-genome of the species under study. Through this approach, the reads corresponding to different copies of AMR genes can be effectively separated based on the genomic context of the AMR genes, and used to infer the nucleotide sequence of each copy. Amira achieves significant improvements in genomic copy number recall and nucleotide accuracy, demonstrated through objective simulations and comparison with alternative read and assembly-based methods on samples with manually curated truth assemblies. Applied to a dataset of 32 Escherichia coli samples with diverse AMR gene content, Amira achieves a mean genomic-copy-number recall of 98.4% with precision 97.9% and nucleotide accuracy 99.9%.

Here, 3-dimensional (3D) analyses of pancreata from control persons without diabetes (ND) revealed heretofore underappreciated frequencies (approximately 50%) of insulin-positive (INS+) glucagon-negative (GCG-) islets. Non-diabetic individuals positive for a single Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADA+) yet at increased risk for disease consistently demonstrated endocrine features, including islet volume and cell composition, closely resembling the age-matched ND controls. In contrast, pancreata from individuals with short-duration T1D demonstrated significantly reduced islet density and a dramatic loss of INS+GCG- islets with preservation of large INS+GCG+ islets. The size and cellular composition of pancreatic islets may, therefore, represent influential factors that impact {beta}-cell loss during T1D disease progression.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

J.; Timmermann, L.; Tan, H.", "abstract": "Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been proposed to facilitate neural information transfer across spatial and temporal scales. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a type of CFC in which the amplitude of a faster brain oscillation is coupled to the phase of a slower brain oscillation, is implicated in various higher-order cognitive functions and was shown to be pathologically altered in neurological and psychiatric disease. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the coupling between gamma amplitude (50-150 Hz) to beta phase (13-35 Hz) is exaggerated. Enhanced {beta}-{gamma} PAC was found in the subthalamic nucleus and various cortical sources and shown to be responsive to dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Therefore, exaggerated {beta}-{gamma} PAC has been proposed to be a disease marker and a potential target for brain circuit interventions. Despite these promising findings, a significant knowledge gap remains, as the spatial and frequency-specific dynamics of {beta}-{gamma} PAC and its association with motor symptoms and therapy remain elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we employed high-density electroencephalography (EEG) with advanced source localisation techniques for PD patients at rest. We highlight three key findings: (1) a frequency-specific increase in high {beta} (23-35 Hz)-{gamma} PAC within and between sources of the cortical motor network, (2) a link between elevated high {beta}-{gamma} PAC and bradykinesia and rigidity when OFF medication, but not tremor, and (3) a medication-induced reduction in high {beta}-{gamma} PAC in the supplementary motor area correlating with clinical improvement. Altogether, this study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of PD as an oscillopathy and identifies high {beta}-{gamma} PAC as a potential marker of Parkinsonian symptoms and treatment effects. This has important implications for invasive as well as non-invasive therapeutic strategies as high {beta}-{gamma} PAC targeting might hold greater promise than targeting {beta}-{gamma} PAC per se.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

M.; Yan, B.; Mostowy, S.; Oehlers, S. H.", "abstract": "Age is an important risk factor for infections such as tuberculosis (TB). Telomerase is expressed in immune cells yet leukocyte telomere length declines during ageing suggesting an age-dependent loss of telomerase activity in the immune system. Leukocyte telomere length has been correlated with worse outcomes in TB patients, however the mechanisms linking telomere biology to TB susceptibility and response to therapy are unexplored. Here we use the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model to investigate the role of telomerase in TB resistance. We find depletion and inhibition of Tert, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, increases bacterial burden in zebrafish embryos while small molecule activation of Tert decreases bacterial burden. Depletion of shelterin components did not recapitulate the infection susceptibility phenotype, and infection susceptibility could not be rescued by p53 or STING depletion. Consistent with a previously described role for Tert in developmental hematopoiesis, we find Tert is necessary for demand-driven emergency myelopoiesis to support containment of extended mycobacterial infection. Our findings establish a previously undescribed role for host telomerase in supporting infection demand-driven hematopoiesis to control infection.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}

While previous study linked Fscn1 deficiency to neonatal lethality in mice, the underlying metabolic mechanism remains unexplored. Here, in this study, we report that systemic knockout (KO) of Fscn1 leads to 52.2% mortality within 24 hours post-birth, accompanied by severe hypoglycemia in KO pups compared to other littermates. Remarkably, this lethality was fully rescued by oral glucose administration, indicating a glucose supply-dependent survival mechanism. Surviving Fscn1 KO neonates displayed persistent developmental deficits, including growth retardation and depleted lipid stores, despite intact canonical insulin-regulated hepatic gluconeogenic pathways. Transcriptomic profiling of P0 livers revealed that Fscn1 loss predominantly disrupts metabolic pathway, within the glycerol phosphate shuttle being the most significantly downregulated module. Mechanistically, Fscn1 KO livers exhibited markedly reduced protein levels of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isoforms (GPD1/GPD2), key enzymes bridging glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Consistently, glycerol tolerance tests (GTT) demonstrated impaired glycerol-to-glucose conversion in Fscn1 KO mice, confirming defective glycerol-driven gluconeogenesis. Our findings establish FSCN1 as a novel cytoskeletal-metabolic integrator essential for neonatal survival by sustaining hepatic glucose production from glycerol, thus revealing an unexpected role of actin dynamics in coordinating metabolic adaptation during early postnatal development.

However, while related in many ways, these models do not yet bridge these scales. We present a framework and architecture called Xpressor that enables cross-scale learning by (1) using a novel cross-attention mechanism to compress high-dimensional gene representations into lower-dimensional cell-state vectors, and (2) implementing a multi-scale fine-tuning approach that allows cell models to leverage and adapt protein-level representations. Using a cell Foundation Model as an example, we demonstrate that our architecture improves model performance across multiple tasks, including cell-type prediction (+12%) and embedding quality (+8%). Together, these advances represent first steps toward models that can understand and bridge different scales of biological organization.", "date": "2025-05-18", "journal": ""}
