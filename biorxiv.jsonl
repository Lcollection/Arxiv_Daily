However, how these two regions coordinate to enable navigation remains poorly understood. Here, we designed an object-matching task where human participants unknowingly manipulated object variants arranged in a ring-like structure around a central prototype. Functional MRI revealed a 3-fold spatial periodicity in the hippocampal activity that tracked navigation directions from object variants to the central prototype. This hippocampal periodicity was phase-locked with the well-documented 6-fold periodicity of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting hierarchical interaction between these regions. Consistent with this neural pattern, a corresponding 3-fold periodicity was observed in behavioral performance, which was synchronized with hippocampal activity. Finally, an EC-HPC PhaseSync model reproduced this phenomenon, in which the 6-fold activity periodicity of entorhinal grid cells across directions projects vectorial representations to the hippocampus, and the collection of these vectors exhibits 3-fold periodicity to represent conceptual directions. Together, these findings reveal a periodic mechanism through which entorhinal grid codes structure hippocampal vector representations.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Their plus-ends, oriented towards the chromosomes, exhibit dynamic instability crucial for kinetochore correct attachments. Involved in this process, the poleward flux implicates the displacement of microtubules towards the spindle poles, coordinated with polymerisation at the plus ends. The mechanisms behind this are diverse. It includes treadmilling powered by microtubule depolymerisation at the spindle poles, sliding of spindle microtubules by molecular motors like Kinesin-5, and pushing microtubules away from the chromosomes by chromokinesins. Interestingly, no such flux was reported in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, although all proteins contributing to flux in mammals have homologs in the nematode. To explore this, we fluorescently labelled microtubules and conducted photobleaching. We found no global poleward flux; the bleached zone's edges moved inward. The centrosome-side front motion was caused by dynamic instability, while the chromosome-side front exhibited faster recovery, suggesting an additional mechanism. This larger slope was detected only near the chromosomes, indicating that only kinetochore microtubules undergo flux. Consistently, this flux depended on proteins ensuring the chromosome attachment and growth of the kinetochore microtubules, notably NDC-80, CLS-2CLASP, and ZYG-9XMAP215. Furthermore, this flux decreased as metaphase progressed and attachments transitioned from side- to end-on; it was reduced by SKA-1 recruitment. Treadmilling was unlikely to account for these observations, as most kinetochore microtubules do not reach spindle poles in the zygote spindle. Conversely, the depletion of kinesin-12 KLP-18KIF15, which cross-links and focuses microtubules at meiosis, reduced the front rate. Ultimately, we propose that the sole kinetochore microtubules slide along spindle microtubules, likely powered by KLP-18, contrasting with solid displacement in other systems. It aligns with observations in human cells of decreasing flux with increasing chromosome distance.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Here, using state-of-the-art single-nuclei multiomic profiling, we map changes in cell-type-specific gene expression and chromatin accessibility in vivo in the human cortex following eSTIM of neurosurgery patients. eSTIM impacts a network of cells that extends beyond excitatory neurons to include inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. We observed an upregulation of canonical immediate-early genes (IEGs: FOS, NPAS4, EGR4) in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and induction of cytokine-related genes CCL3 and CCL4 in microglia. The cross-species conservation of this gene signature, together with our examination of a cohort of both epilepsy and cancer patients, underscores the fundamental role of these changes in stimulation-driven plasticity while controlling for disease and environmental confounds. Our study of changes in chromatin accessibility reveals a common code that involves a cell-type specific signature of transcription factor binding motifs for members of the EGR family. By addressing these previously unexplored questions about activity-induced gene expression in vivo in the human brain, our findings challenge the long-standing neuron-centric view of eSTIM, highlighting the broader role of non-neuronal cells, including microglia, in mediating the impact of brain stimulation.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Given that self-reported reward sensitivity and level of substance use have been associated with differences in VS activation, we set out to investigate whether these factors would be independently associated with enhancements to neural reward responses within social contexts. In this pre-registered study, participants (N=45) underwent fMRI while playing a card guessing game in which correct or incorrect guesses resulted in monetary gains and losses that were shared evenly with either a close friend, stranger (confederate), or non-human partner. Consistent with our prior work, we found increased VS activation when sharing rewards with a socially close peer as opposed to an out-of-network stranger. As self-reported reward sensitivity increased, the difference in VS response to rewards shared with friends and strangers decreased. We also found enhanced connectivity between the VS and temporoparietal junction when sharing rewards with close friends as opposed to strangers. Finally, exploratory analyses revealed that as reward sensitivity and sub-clinical substance use increase, the difference in VS connectivity with the right fusiform face area increases as a function of social context. These findings demonstrate that responsivity to the context of close friends may be tied to individual reward sensitivity or sub-clinical substance use habits; together these factors may inform predictions of risk for future mental health disorders.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) derive their efficacy from this cancer-immune cell interface, however, immune-related adverse events resulting from systemic blockade remain a significant challenge. To address this need for potent, yet highly tumor-specific immunotherapies, we developed Tumor-Immune Cell Targeting Chimeras (TICTACs), antibody conjugates that are capable of selectively depleting immune checkpoint receptors such as SIRP from the surface of TAMs. These chimeric molecules consist of a synthetic glycan ligand that binds the C-type lectin CD206, a well-established TAM marker, conjugated to a non-blocking antibody that binds but does not inhibit the checkpoint receptor. By engaging CD206, which constitutively recycles between the plasma membrane and early endosomes, TICTACs facilitate robust removal of the checkpoint receptors from the surface of CD206high macrophages, while having no effect on CD206low macrophages. By decoupling antibody selectivity from its blocking function, we present a new paradigm for developing highly tumor-specific immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

The lack of paired sequencing experiments limits the analysis of microRNA-gene regulatory networks. We explore whether protein-coding gene expression can be quantified directly from transcript fragments present in sRNA-seq experiments. We analyze studies containing matched total RNA and small RNA from four human tissues and recover transcript fragments from the sRNA-seq datasets. We find that the expression levels of protein-coding gene transcripts derived from sRNA-seq datasets are comparable to those from total RNA-seq experiments (R2 ranging from 0.33 to 0.76). Analyses across multiple tissues and species show similar correlations, indicating that the approach is applicable across organisms. We confirm that transcript half-life and the expression of housekeeping or highly abundant genes do not bias the results. Analysis of the expression of both microRNAs and coding genes from the same sRNA-seq experiments demonstrate that known microRNA-target interactions are, as expected, inversely correlated with the expression profiles of these microRNA-mRNA pairs. For a dual mRNA/miRNA profile, we recommend sequencing the [&ge;]25 nucleotide fraction at [&ge;]5 M reads. To confirm the utility of this approach, we apply our method to breast cancer sRNA-seq datasets lacking total RNA-seq data and achieve 75% recall and 64% accuracy comparing inferred coding gene expression with qPCR-validated targets.

W.; Vriend, G.; Kotulska, M.", "abstract": "While three-dimensional structures of globular and transmembrane forms are available for many amyloid proteins, structures of their amyloid forms are scarce in the PDB. Amyloids pose major challenges for both experimental structure determination and computational modelling. We evaluated the amyloid-modelling performance of the current top modelling software, AlphaFold 3 (AF3), using three datasets. Dataset 1 contains 153 proteins and peptides that are known to form fibrils, but their 3D structures have not been experimentally determined. Dataset 2 contains 56 non-aggregating/non-amyloid peptides. Dataset 3 contains seven proteins for which the three-dimensional fibrillar structure is known. Fibrillar structures were predicted for 34% of dataset 1, but unfortunately also for 54% of dataset 2. Fibrillar structures were successfully predicted for five out of seven proteins from dataset 3. Comparing AF3 with different methods, it outperformed Boltz, and predicted the structures of CsgA and -synuclein more correctly than RibbonFold, whereas the latter predicted A{beta}-42 better. The performance of AF3 in prediction of amyloid structures for our datasets seems hindered by low abundance of amyloid structures in the PDB and high prevalence of structure data for their non-fibrillar forms. AF3 tends to assign a higher quality score to globular oligomeric models than to fibrillar ones. A correct amyloid structure prediction is more likely to be obtained for shorter fragments. The amyloid modelling quality of AF3 seems underwhelming, but it can still provide hypotheses about amyloid structures in some cases.

We show that before the formation of germ layers, the chromatin and transcription states of cells are uncoupled, and become progressively connected during gastrulation and somitogenesis. Silencing of developmental genes is achieved by local spreading of repressive chromatin together with cell-type specific demethylation. Combining transcription factor (TF) expression and chromatin states within an interpretable machine learning model, we classify TFs as lineage-specific activators and repressors and identify a subset of TFs that are epigenetically regulated.

However, cognitive abilities vary in how they change with age: whereas executive functions, like working memory, show age-related decline, aspects of linguistic processing remain relatively preserved. The heterogeneity of the cognitive-behavioral landscape in aging predicts differences among brain networks in whether and how they should change with age. To evaluate this prediction, we used individual-subject fMRI analyses ('precision fMRI') to examine the language-selective network and, for control purposes, the Multiple Demand (MD) network, which supports executive functions, in older adults (n=64) relative to young controls (n=483). In line with past claims, relative to young adults, the MD network of older adults shows weaker, less spatially extensive, and more topographically variable activations during an executive function task and reduced within-network functional connectivity. However, in stark contrast to the MD network, we find remarkable preservation of the language network in older adults. Their language network responds during language comprehension as strongly and selectively as in younger adults, and shows a similar degree of left-hemispheric lateralization and within-network functional connectivity.

E.", "abstract": "Multicellular organisms are confronted not only with germline mutations, but also mutations emerging in somatic cells. Somatic mutations can lead to various conditions, diseases, and cancers in particular. Somatic mutation rate is limited by evolved protection mechanisms, notably those repairing damaged DNA or eliminating mutated cells. However, in a broader context, life history traits such as body mass, age of first reproduction and reproductive lifespan, can also be subject to selection due to the negative fitness impacts of disease. Here, I analyze a simple coevolutionary model of somatic mutation rate (SMR) and fitness lifespan (hereafter called fitspan), the latter measured as the age at which inclusive fitness becomes negligible. Evolution in the model is driven by the fitness costs of disease, because as organisms age: disease is more extensive, disease prevention mechanisms are less effective and more costly, and fitness payoffs of disease prevention are lower. I investigate relations between selective forces and (co)evolutionary responses, notably showing the possibility of either monotone or oscillatory non-equilibrium dynamics and fast or slow returns to equilibrium. I then compare model predictions to recently published data on body mass, lifespan and somatic mutation rate. I show that the model (1) can explain the non-linear empirical relationship between somatic mutation and lifespan, (2) predicts the evolution of longer lifespans through a heretofore ignored feedback loop, and (3) the model is consistent with the idea that the linear relation between somatic mutation accumulation and age is the net result of mutational washing-out.

The elucidation of the phenotypic changes that gave rise to maize have focused on the direct consequences of domestication, with no insights on how environmental factors could have influenced specific gene function and human selection. The genome of the Palomero toluqueno landrace suggested heavy metal (HM) effects on maize domestication (Vielle Calzada et al., 2009). To test the hypothesis that HM stress influenced the evolutionary transition of teosinte to maize, we exposed both subspecies to sublethal concentrations of copper and cadmium. We also assessed the genetic diversity of three HM response genes mapping to chromosome 5 (chr.5) and previously shown to be affected by domestication: ZmHMA1, ZmHMA7, encoding for heavy metal ATPases of the P1b family, and ZmSKUs5, encoding for a multicopper oxidase. ZmHMA1 and ZmSKUs5 are within a genomic region containing hundreds of genes linked to QTLs with pleiotropic effects on domestication. The genomic analysis of chr.5 shows that the three genes were under strong positive selection as compared to previously identified domestication genes. Large scale transcriptomic comparisons indicate that many other loci containing HM response genes were also positively selected across the maize genome. Exposure of teosinte parviglumis to HM stress results in a plant architecture reminiscent of extant maize, and upregulation of Teosinte branched1 (Tb1) in the meristem. ZmHMA1 and ZmHMA7 are expressed throughout development and respond to HM stress in both subspecies. ZmHMA1 is mainly involved in restricting plant height and optimizing the number of female inflorescences and seminal roots. Paleoenvironmental studies reveal a temporal and geographical convergence between volcanic eruptions and maize emergence during the early Holocene, at periods of climatic instability. Overall, these results suggest that abiotic stress influenced the evolutionary transition that gave rise to extant maize through the activity of heavy metal response genes and their phenotypic effects, as a possible consequence of volcanic activity.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Classical experiments have suggested that contact between cells derived from distinct orientations-dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior-within the regenerating blastema is necessary for accurate limb pattern formation. However, the molecular basis for this requirement has remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that both dorsal and ventral tissues are required for limb formation via induction of Shh expression, which plays a crucial role in limb patterning. Using the accessory limb model (ALM), we induced position-specific blastemas lacking cells derived from a single orientation (anterior, posterior, dorsal, or ventral). Patterned limb formation occurred only in blastemas containing both dorsal- and ventral-derived cells. We further observed that Shh expression requires dorsoventral contact within a blastema, highlighting the necessity of dorsoventral contact for inducing Shh expression. In addition, we identified WNT10B and FGF2 as dorsal- and ventral-mediated signals, respectively, that create the inductive environment for Shh expression. Our findings clarify the role of dorsal and ventral cells in inducing Shh, a mechanism that has rarely been studied in the context of limb regeneration and pattern formation. This model provides new insights into how cells with different positional identities drive the regeneration process.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

A. baumannii can acquire DNA through multiple mechanisms including natural competence and conjugation. An active Type VI Secretion System (T6SS), which kills nonkin bacteria and challenges and inhibits the conjugation. The acquisition of resistance genes has helped the spread of resistant clones of A. baumannii, such as those of Sequence Types (STPas), ST1, ST2, ST10, ST15, ST25, ST79 and ST85. While ST1 and ST2 were thoroughly studied, there are new emerging clones whose genetic background facilitating the rise is still unknown or poorly understood. The emergence of Acinetobacter baumannii ST19 first peaked in 2003, coinciding with the Iraq conflict and increased detection among U.S. military personnel. Its prevalence later surged in Georgia and Ukraine, around the onset of the conflict in Ukraine in 2022, associating it with regions affected by military activity. In this study, we have sequenced whole-genome three isolates of A. baumannii ST19 and compared them with further 156 A. baumannii ST19 genomes were obtained from public repositories. In total, 157/159 genomes revealed loss of T6SS locus, which was replaced in 56/157 genomes (35,7%) by {Delta}Tn9 carrying chloramphenicol and {Delta}Tn10 carrying tetracycline resistance genes, and formaldehyde and chlorite resistance genes. Surprisingly, the antibiotic resistance-encoding transposons likely originated from Enterobacteriaceae plasmids. The loss of a functional T6SS in A. baumannii ST19 may potentially facilitate horizontal gene transfer and promoting a cooperative or less competitive lifestyle providing a selective advantage at the population level.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

We asked whether these discrepancies arise from how stimuli are presented. Thirty adults memorized seven digits presented in four modes: Simultaneous (all digits for 2800 ms) or sequential presentations at Fast (400 ms per digit), Slow (1000 ms per digit), and Fast+delay (400 ms per digit plus a 600 ms free time in between). We analyzed EEG during encoding and a 6 s retention period in theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (18-24 Hz) frequency bands. Encoding produced parametric load-related theta increase and beta decrease, possibly reflecting growing executive control demands and motor program formation, respectively. Alpha power did not scale with load during encoding. Single trial models linked stronger encoding theta and deeper alpha suppression to better recall, whereas retention power did not predict accuracy. During retention, theta and beta were unaffected by presentation mode. Alpha power did not differ significantly when all sequential modes were grouped together compared to the simultaneous mode. However, the Fast+delay mode uniquely showed below-baseline alpha in the first half of the retention. Our findings suggest that alpha dynamics are sensitive to the temporal structure of encoding and retention periods, particularly the presence or absence of free intervals between stimulus presentations. We propose that alpha modulation during WM retention may reflect processes beyond the simple gating of irrelevant sensory information.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

A.; Kao, A. B.", "abstract": "Cognitive abilities are central to how animals navigate complex environments. Beyond individual cognition, group living can also enhance navigation by pooling individually acquired information. One way this may be achieved is by following experienced leaders, which requires recognizing expertise within group members. Alternatively, accurate decisions could also emerge without expert opinions, through simpler mechanisms like the 'wisdom of crowds' principle that average out individual biases. Consequently, collective navigation strategies range from cognitively complex to simple, and yet, the prevalence or interplay of different collective strategies in nature remains unexplored. In this study, we asked: what is the navigation mechanism, requiring minimal cognitive demands, that is necessary and sufficient to quantitatively replicate the experimental results of a 2017 study on homing pigeons (Columba livia), which showed that sequential chains of bird pairs flying home -- similar to a game of telephone -- led to shorter homing routes compared to control birds flying individually or in fixed pairs. Our results show that the experimental data aligns closely with the simplest strategy -- route averaging. Surprisingly, the complex mechanism of selectively propagating the best flight through social learning offered no additional advantage. We further observed that mixed strategies, although not supported by the experimental data, in theory combined advantages from both averaging and active selection of better routes, resulting in even greater performance. Hence, our results highlight the potential for future research to investigate selective pressures shaping the evolution of cultural learning and trade-offs among different decision mechanisms theoretically available to social animals in nature.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

In response to crowding and starvation, C. elegans nematodes form dauer larvae, in which development arrests until conditions improve.

Pre-dauer feeding, but not nutrient sensing via the DAF-2/insulin-like signaling receptor or DAF-7/TGF-{beta}, is required for plasticity in gonad size. Gonad differences in dauer have lifelong reproductive consequences; severely starved worms make small dauer gonads and have small broods. Pre-dauer starvation induces germline quiescence and near-instantaneous reduction of the Notch ligand LAG-2 on the germline stem cell niche.

Traditional cell culture media contains estrogen-mimetic compounds, including phenol red and endogenous estrogen in fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, the potential of these compounds to bias in vitro studies, particularly when considering sex as a biological variable, remains unclear. This gap in understanding critically impacts the culture of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs), whose basic functions and differentiation potential, central to cell therapy and tissue engineering, are sensitive to perturbations in the culture conditions. Despite this, the effect of estrogens from cell culture media on male and female hMSCs is not currently considered in cell processing for clinical trials. As such, a baseline understanding of these estrogen-mimetic media influences on hMSCs is critical for clinical efficacy and adequate study design in research. To this end, we investigated the effects of phenol red and fetal bovine serum on the proliferation, metabolism, senescence, and differentiation capacity of male and female hMSCs. Phenol red, FBS, donor sex, and 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) supplementation all had significant impacts on hMSC health and differentiation potential in culture. Notably, dosing with estrogen at the levels found in FBS did not recover most of the hMSC metrics tested. The only outcomes that were not significantly different based on donor sex were senescence and mRNA transcripts for RUNX2 and PPARG, transcriptional regulators for osteogenesis and adipogenesis.

Splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) are the key cell type for maintenance of systemic iron homeostasis. They manage exceptionally high iron flux by recycling aged red blood cells (RBCs) through erythrophagocytosis, a specialized form of efferocytosis. Yet, how RPMs adapt to iron deficiency is unknown. Surprisingly, we show that RPMs from mildly anemic, iron-deficient (ID) mice exhibit enhanced erythrophagocytic capacity. Proteomic profiling and flow cytometry revealed expansion and activation of lysosomal and mitochondrial networks, accompanied by elevated mitochondrial respiration. This metabolic rewiring and the increase in erythrophagocytosis depended on efficient branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism. These responses occurred independently of classical M2 polarization and were absent in other macrophage populations. Mechanistically, the low hepcidin-high ferroportin (FPN) axis and SYK kinase activity emerged as key drivers of this functional rewiring. Pharmacological inhibition of SYK or BCAA catabolism reversed the ID phenotype in RPMs. Together, these findings highlight a unique metabolic reprogramming of RPMs that enhances their specialized efferocytic functions during systemic iron scarcity.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Here we investigated the decision-making associated with allopreening in wild sulphur-crested cockatoos, conducting detailed observations of 182 allopreening events between 126 individuals while concurrently recording rank, aggressive interactions, and social networks. We found no influence of sex as predicted if allopreening was primarily about pair bonding, but instead a positive correlation between allopreening and aggression (given and received). Within interactions, individuals were influenced by social association strength and rank, with individuals preening for longer and with more turn-taking when interacting with stronger social associates, and individuals investing more in interactions initiated by higher-ranked individuals. Our results are highly suggestive that allopreening may serve a convergent function in wild parrots to primates, both in maintaining social bonds and in negotiating social tolerance.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

To address these challenges, it is common to first infer gene trees using conventional models, then refine them through species tree-aware correction methods. Recently, it has been argued that such corrections can lead to overfitting and force gene trees to resemble the species tree, thereby obscuring genuine gene-level variation caused by ILS.

Two leading hypotheses are that HGA predominantly represents summed postsynaptic potentials or, more commonly, predominantly represents summed local spikes.

We trained subjects to decouple local spiking from HGA on a single electrode using a brain-machine interface. Their ability to decouple them suggested that HGA is likely not simply generated by summed local spiking. Instead, HGA correlated with neuronal population co-firing of neurons that were widely distributed across millimeters. The neuronal spikes that contributed more to this co-firing also contributed more to, and preceded, spike-triggered HGA. These results suggest that HGA arises predominantly from summed postsynaptic potentials triggered by synchronous co-firing of widely distributed neurons.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

However, its accuracy is lower for interactions without coevolutionary signals, such as host-pathogen and antibody-antigen interactions. Two strategies have been developed to address this limitation: massive sampling and replacing the evoformer with the pairformer, which does not rely on coevolution, as introduced in AlphaFold3, thereby enabling more structural reasoning by the network. Results: In this study, we benchmark structure prediction methods on unseen antibody-antigen complexes. We found that increased sampling improves the chances of generating a correct protein model, roughly in a log-linear manner. However, the internal quality estimates by AlphaFold often cannot identify the best predicted structures for each target, resulting in a significant loss of performance for the top-ranked protein model compared with the best model. For all methods, a significant challenge remains the identification of the best model. We also show that AlphaFold3 outperforms AlphaFold2, Boltz-1, and Chai-1.

Widespread heterozygous loss of Pten in two SHH-MB mouse models increases penetrance and excellerates onset of differentiated tumors. We delineated cellular and transcriptional changes that accelerate tumor growth and cause differentiation using a sporadic SHH-MB mouse model expressing oncogenic SmoM2 in rare cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) and scRNA-seq analysis. Homozygous but not heterozygous sporadic loss of Pten resulted in rapid acceleration of tumor growth and end stage disease by 40 days, compared to ~25% survival in control SmoM2 mice at 100 days. Heterozygous PTEN mutations therefore should negatively impact disease outcome primarily with germline mutations. Loss of Pten in normal or SmoM2-expressing GCPs increased proliferation and enhanced progenitor state initially but by 12 days Pten mutant SmoM2 tumors were highly differentiated due to increased survival of non-proliferating GCPs. Furthermore, macrophage infiltration and cytotoxicity appeared reduced in differentiated regions of tumors lacking Pten, indicating cell nonautonomous changes could also contribute to accelerated tumor growth.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Both colour and morphology exhibit early bursts of evolutionary disparity, followed by recurrent lineage-specific radiations and widespread convergence toward similar adaptive optima across the phylogeny. Dietary ecotypes emerged as the strongest predictor of morphological diversification, whereas symbiotic and social regimes exerted the strongest effects on colour evolution.

Disruption of parental care, for example through parental separation, can negatively affect offspring development in rodents. While previous work has focused on maternal and paternal deprivation, the effects of cross-fostering, another form of parental-offspring instability, on brain development remain poorly understood. Such disruptions are thought to induce stress, which in turn can suppress neurogenesis and increases inflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus, with effects that often differ between sexes. Given that degus (Octodon degus) are born precocial and form strong attachments with their parents early in life, this study aimed to investigate the effect of cross-fostering on hippocampal development in female and male degu pups. At postnatal day 8, degus were assigned to either control (pups remained with parents and littermates), partial cross-foster (one pup per litter was cross-fostered), or full cross-foster (the entire litter was cross-fostered) conditions. At weaning (5-weeks-old), offspring brains were collected for immunohistochemistry to examine dentate gyrus volume, density of pyknotic cells, density of immature neurons, and number and morphology of microglia. Both types of cross-fostering reduced hippocampal cell death in both sexes relative to controls, while no significant effects were observed in the dentate gyrus volume or density of immature neurons. Cross-fostering did not affect total microglia density in either sex however full cross-fostered females had fewer amoeboid microglia compared to female controls.

Methods: LCLE-Ag NPs were synthesized and characterized by using UV visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and electron microscopy. Antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of the synthesized NPs were assessed against P. aeruginosa isolates KPW.1-S1 and HRW.1-S3. Extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), and extracellular DNA (eDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were visualized using epifluorescence microscopy. The ability of the nanoparticles to eradicate preformed biofilm was also evaluated. The expressions of quorum-sensing genes were analyzed using semi quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cytotoxicity was tested on human kidney epithelial-like cells. Results: The synthesized LCLE-Ag NPs displayed an absorption peak at 416 nm and a size range of 30 to 35 nm. They exhibited significant antibacterial and antibiofilm activities correlating with decreased EPS and eDNA levels. LCLE-Ag NPs effectively disrupted both preformed and antibiotic-induced biofilms and such activities were found to be associated with increased ROS levels and decrease in lasI and pqsA expression.

Currently, no mechanism exists for LBN as there are no late gestation human kidney transcriptional datasets. We hypothesized that a differentiated but dividing population of nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) would contribute to the amplification of nephrons in late gestation. We used the rhesus macaque, an established model of LBN, to help identify potential mechanisms. Methods: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was performed on cortically-enriched fetal rhesus kidneys (n=9) from late second trimester and third trimester during LBN. This data was integrated with publicly available human scRNA-seq datasets from 8-18 weeks gestation kidneys (n=8) using state-of-the-art bioinformatics pipelines. Differentially expressed genes and ligand-receptor interactions were assessed and validated using RNAScopeTM on human and rhesus archival tissue. Results: scRNA-Seq of 64,782 rhesus cells revealed 37 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, including 7,879 rhesus NPCs. Pseudotime analyses identified a late gestation-specific lineage branch of differentiated NPC in rhesus that was not observed in mid-gestation humans. Differential expression analyses identified increased SFRP1, FZD4, and TLE2 and decreased FZD7, SHISA2, SHISA3, and TLE4 within the late-gestation rhesus NPC compared to mid-gestation human NPC and increased SEMA3D within the rhesus UB tip, suggesting a compositional shift in WNT and SEMA signaling components within the naive NPC population during LBN. Conclusion: The rhesus macaque uniquely enables molecular studies of late-gestation primate nephrogenesis. Our study suggests the hypothesis that a transitional state of self-renewing NPCs supported by compositional shifts in key pathways may underlie the switch from branching phase nephrogenesis to lateral branch nephrogenesis and support ongoing nephron formation in late gestation.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Some have thus suggested a functional dichotomy between these VP subpopulations in reward versus threat. We test this hypothesis by asking how inhibiting VPGABA impacts active and passive defensive responses to learned threat cues in the absence of rewards. We taught GAD1:Cre rats with inhibitory VPGABA DREADDs (or control rats) that a metal probe delivers shock, or that a 20sec auditory cue precedes footshocks. These stimuli thereafter elicit active defensive burying, or passive freezing responses, respectively. We found that VPGABA inhibition with CNO markedly increased stimulus-appropriate defensive responses to both types of learned threats, but failed to consistently alter new learning about them -- suggesting VPGABA mediates aversive motivation but not memory formation. VPGABA inhibition also altered threat-related c-Fos expression within VP cell populations, and in their efferent target lateral habenula, but not mediodorsal thalamus -- pointing to potential underlying circuit mechanisms of defensive responses. Results indicate that VPGABA neurons not only promote reward seeking as previously reported, but that they may also actively inhibit defensive responses to threats that might otherwise compete with reward seeking. This refines our understanding of subcortical valanced motivation circuits, and may suggest new targets for intervening in disorders like addiction and depression.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

The universally conserved 16S rRNA nucleotide C1402, for example, is the only 2'-O-methylated nucleotide in the bacterial small (30S) ribosomal subunit and this modification fine tunes the shape and structure of the peptidyl tRNA binding site. The Cm1402 modification is incorporated by the conserved bacterial 16S rRNA methyltransferase RsmI, but it is unclear how RsmI is able to recognize its 30S substrate and specifically modify its buried target nucleotide. We determined a 2.42 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of the RsmI-30S complex and, with accompanying functional analyses, show that RsmI anchors itself to the 30S subunit through multiple contacts with a conserved 16S rRNA surface present only in the assembled subunit. This positions RsmI to induce an extensive h44 distortion to access C1402 that is unprecedented among 16S rRNA methyltransferases characterized to date. These analyses also reveal an essential contribution to 30S subunit interaction made by the previously structurally uncharacterized RsmI C-terminal domain, RsmI-induced RNA-RNA interactions with C1402, and an unappreciated dependence on a divalent metal ion for activity that suggests RsmI may be first of a distinct class of metal- and SAM-dependent RNA O-methyltransferases.

W.; Krishnakumar, R.", "abstract": "Background: Green microalgae, such as Monoraphidium minutum 26B-AM, have garnered significant commercial interest due to their high biomass production and lipid yield, providing promising candidates for various bioprocessing applications. However, the economic viability of large-scale algal cultivation in open raceway ponds is limited by biocontamination and environmental stressors, necessitating deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin resilience and productivity in these systems. We hypothesized that the molecular signature associated with the cellular responses of M. minutum to environmental stressors will reveal critical information for the timely prediction of resilience and productivity in algal cultures within open pond systems. Results: To test this hypothesis, we conducted a longitudinal multi-omic study, integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics, to monitor the acclimation, growth dynamics, and pathogen responses of algal cultures in two 1000 L raceway ponds, before and after the introduction of a pathogen as a stressor. We identified a number of molecular patterns that correlate with changes in the algal environment, and we can track these changes within the ponds per time. Furthermore, we identify scale-up and infection-specific molecular pathways through integrated multi-omics, showing that most patterns are unique to each studied stressor/transition. Conclusions: Ultimately, this study demonstrates the utility of multi-omics observations at scale, revealing unique signatures and laying the groundwork for developing molecular detection techniques and predictive models that can improve the sustainability and efficiency of large-scale algae biomass production.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

A.; Murshed, M.; Ferron, M.", "abstract": "Studies in humans suggest that vitamin K is involved in the regulation of bone remodeling, but the precise mechanism at play remains unknown. In cells, vitamin K functions as a co-factor for the {gamma}-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), an enzyme responsible for the conversion of glutamic acid residues (Glu) into {gamma}-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues in secreted proteins. We aim here at determining the role of {gamma}-carboxylation in bone remodeling and at identifying the Gla protein(s) involved. We show that male mice lacking {gamma}-carboxylation specifically in osteoblasts (Ggcxflox/flox;OCN-Cre) have increased bone mass at 6 months of age due to a reduced number of multinucleated bone resorbing osteoclasts. In co-culture experiments, Ggcx-deficient osteoblasts were less effective than control osteoblasts at supporting osteoclast formation. Among known Gla proteins, we identify GAS6 as an osteoblast-secreted {gamma}-carboxylated factor which signals to differentiating osteoclasts. The GAS6 receptors MerTK and AXL are expressed in pre-osteoclasts and pharmacological inhibitors of AXL and MerTK block osteoclast generation in co-culture. Conversely, recombinant {gamma}-carboxylated GAS6 dose-dependently increases the size of osteoclasts and the number of nuclei per osteoclast in culture. GAS6 marginally affected the induction of osteoclast-specific genes during osteoclast differentiation but significantly increased pre-osteoclast fusion. Finally, increasing bone marrow GAS6 level in transgenic male mice was sufficient to increase the number and size of osteoclasts and to decrease bone mass. This work identifies GAS6 as a novel osteoblast-derived vitamin K-dependent protein regulating osteoclast maturation.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

It acts through competitive inhibition of natural ligand estrogen (E2) at the estrogen receptor (ER), affecting ER interactions with other nuclear receptors, chromatin modulators, genomic structural proteins and co-regulators. Although tamoxifen inhibits the progression of breast cancer, it increases the risk of endometrial cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. Progesterone receptor (PR) and ER cistromes of endometrial adenocarcinoma Ishikawa cells treated with ovarian hormones showed that ER binding sites are shared by PR at open sites of chromatin. This could explain, in part, progestin regulation of estrogen effects on ER/PR positive endometrial cancer cells. Here, we compared ER cistromes from endometrial tumors of tamoxifen users and non-users with ER and PR cistromes from Ishikawal model to evaluate how SERM exposure affects ER-binding signature. Non-user ER cistrome is closer to R5020-treated Ishikawa PR cistrome, while tamoxifen users ER cistrome is similar to estradiol-treated Ishikawa ER cistrome. The subset of ERbs of non-users regulates inflammatory signaling pathway genes. In contrast, the subset of ERbs of tamoxifen users modulates early estrogen response pathway genes, such as the oncogene NRIP1. This suggests that exposure to tamoxifen redirects ER binding toward genomic regions typically responsive to estrogen, whereas ER binding in non-users retains features associated with PR-occupied regulatory sites. These results provide an example of how SERM treatment may remodel endometrial tumor epigenetic landscape, highlighting context-dependent genomic responses that should be considered to prevent deregulation of endometrial tissue under tamoxifen exposure. These results could explain a context dependent response of genomic regions critical to be taken into account to prevent a deregulation of endometrial cells under tamoxifen treatment.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

We ask whether simple aggregation pathways can intrinsically generate hormesis--a biphasic profile with low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition. We formulate a minimal mechanistic model in which a single inhibitor interacts sequentially with pathway intermediates. Analysis and simulation show a robust non-monotonic response: low inhibitor doses increase aggregate formation, whereas high doses suppress it. We prove that this profile is structural--arising from chemical network topology rather than tuned kinetic parameters.

A.", "abstract": "In visually complex and dynamically changing environments, humans must often filter out salient but task-irrelevant stimuli. Prior work shows that with repeated exposure to search arrays containing color singleton distractors, individuals can learn to divert attention away from these salient items. However, the neural mechanisms supporting such attentional suppression remain unclear. The present study examined the temporal trajectories of singleton distractor representations during visual search to address this gap. Using multivariate pattern analyses of EEG data (N = 40), we identified two clusters of decodable singleton distractor representations: an early cluster from 100-200 ms and a later cluster from 200-400 ms. Temporal generalization analyses showed that the later representations were transformed versions of the early ones. Importantly, stronger late, but not early representations, predicted faster search responses, suggesting that the later signals support distractor suppression. We hypothesized that this transformation facilitates suppressing singleton distractors in the spatial priority map. Comparing decoding evidence across locations revealed that target locations were consistently enhanced relative to non-singleton distractors, whereas singleton distractor locations were suppressed. Moreover, comparing the neural coding of locations revealed that the spatial organization in the singleton distractor neural space was inverted relative to that in the target neural space. Together, these findings reveal a rapid representational transformation underlying salient distractor suppression at the onset of visual search. This rapid inversion of singleton distractor signals was likely driven by top-down control mechanisms that transform bottom-up saliency signals, producing an inverted arrangement of target and distractor information within a shared neural space.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Relapsed AML remains largely unresponsive to current therapies and carries a poor prognosis. We developed a large-language model (LLM) agent that incorporates multi-modal data to nominate druggable therapeutic targets for AML. We identified that higher expression of AGTR2 (encoding AT2R) is associated with better chemotherapy response and longer survival. In functional studies of 68 primary human AML samples, we found that LSCs consistently lacked AT2R expression. Across both CD34-expressing and -non-expressing AML samples, AT2R expression positively correlated with CD34 and CD117 expression. In patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models using 21 primary AML samples, AT2R- cells initiated leukemia, whereas AT2R+ cells failed to do so. AT2R- cells gave rise to both AT2R+ and AT2R- progeny, suggesting hierarchical differentiation. Following chemotherapy in AML PDX mice, bone marrow analysis showed a marked enrichment of AT2R- cells and depletion of AT2R+ cells, indicating that AT2R- cells drive minimal residual disease and relapse. These results support the role of AT2R absence as a marker of LSCs. We observed reduced AT2R expression in AML cells compared to healthy peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Whole-genome sequencing of AML patients revealed no functional mutations in AGTR2. However, 3D chromatin and epigenetic analyses uncovered frequent chromatin rearrangements involving AGTR2 promoter-silencer interactions, indicating epigenetic silencing as a likely mechanism for AT2R downregulation in AML. To validate the tumor suppressor role of AT2R, we developed murine AML models driven by MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a fusions with either Agtr2 knockdown or enforced expression. Agtr2 knockdown accelerated leukemogenesis, while enforced Agtr2 expression delayed AML progression. In these models, enforced Agtr2 expression reduced LSC frequency, impaired cell cycle progression, and decreased AML stemness, as confirmed by limiting dilution assays and analysis of LSC-enriched populations. Mechanistically, enforced Agtr2 expression suppressed fatty acid metabolism - a key driver of AML stemness and growth - and inhibited downstream signaling pathways, including GSK3, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/b-catenin. This led to reduced SREBF1 activity, confirmed by protein level changes and CUT&Tag assays. We tested buloxibutid (C21), a small-molecule AT2R agonist currently in phase II trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in AML PDX models derived from 20 de novo and 6 relapsed AML samples.

More than half of human proteins, however, contain mixtures of disordered regions and one or more folded domains, and the biological function of these multi-domain proteins depends on the interplay between the folded and disordered regions. Here, we developed AF-CALVADOS, a coarse-grained simulation model that is informed by AlphaFold to model the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins and multi-domain proteins containing mixtures of folded and disordered regions. AF-CALVADOS leverages information from AlphaFold 2 to model folded regions that we then integrate with the coarse-grained CALVADOS model. Our automated framework makes it possible to perform simulations of any soluble folded or disordered protein without manually defining the folded regions, enabling scaling to the proteome level. We validate AF-CALVADOS using experimental SAXS data for more than 400 proteins and find that it performs well across proteins with varying amounts of ordered and disordered regions. We demonstrate the scalability of AF-CALVADOS by performing simulations of 12,483 intracellular human proteins and make the data freely available; we envisage that large-scale simulation data generated by AF-CALVADOS can be used to benchmark or train machine learning models for flexible, multi-domain proteins.

Here, we propose that consideration of both independent, linear relationships (as in standard approaches such as linear kernel ridge regression and connectome-based predictive modeling) as well as higher order statistical associations - such as tertiary interactions between matrix components and global features of the matrix space - will enhance identification of meaningful individual differences. To test this, we adopt a geometrically grounded measure of similarity that accounts for higher-order local statistical relationships and global interactions, the Wasserstein metric. Results indicate that considering connectivity matrices as representations of their associated Gaussian distributions significantly improves both identification of individuals based on their connectivity matrices (aka, 'fingerprinting') and prediction of individual differences in phenotypes such as fluid intelligence and openness to experience. Thus, both pairwise local and global brain connectivity properties encode for meaningful individual differences that relate to phenotypic expressions and should be considered in brain-behavior predictive models.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

In this model organism, yeast, the PIC selects TSSs through a unidirectional scanning mechanism referred to as promoter scanning. Previous studies have shown that the TFIIH subunit Tfb3 connects TFIIH to the rest of the PIC through interactions with Pol II and the GTF TFIIE. Activities within the PIC that influence TSS selection can do so by control of initiation efficiency at individual TSSs or by control of TSS scanning (either rate of scanning or scanning processivity). To understand how this critical interface withing the PIC participates in scanning, we used genetic screens to identify tfb3 and tfa1 mutants that alter initiation using initiation-linked phenotypes. We found mutations within the TFIIH-Pol II-TFIIE interface able to alter promoter scanning in either upstream or downstream directions, suggesting that changes to this interface can fine-tune scanning. Subsets of alleles were analyzed using TSS sequencing approaches, showing that tested tfb3 and tfa1 alleles shift TSS distributions across most genomic promoters. Genetic interaction and genomic analysis revealed that the Tfb3 interfaces with Rpb7 and Tfa1 separately contribute to promoter scanning, and that tfb3 alleles exhibit additive effects with scanning processivity mutants in, consistent with Tfb3-PIC interactions modulating scanning processivity. The ability of this interface to easily modulate scanning in both directions is consistent with the types of changes that might incrementally allow promoter scanning to have evolved.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

M.; Sabatini, B. L.", "abstract": "Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons provide precisely timed, context-dependent inhibition within cortical circuits. PV neuron firing properties are specialized among cortical neurons, suggesting that they express a unique complement of ion channels. Here, we identify the PV-specific silent voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel subunit Kv6.4 (encoded by Kcng4), whose role in cortical PV neuron physiology was previously unknown, as a modulator of both intrinsic and synaptic properties. Kv6.4 does not form functional channels on its own but, as shown in prior work, assembles with Kv2 subunits to create heterotetrameric channel complexes, effectively reducing Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier current. We find that Kcng4 expression is enriched within a distinct Pvalb-expressing subclass in primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex and emerges during postnatal development. In PV neurons, Kv6.4 loss reduces action potential (AP) height and width, hyperpolarizes the threshold and interspike potential, and accelerates AP upstroke particularly during repetitive firing. Kv6.4 loss, potentially due to the changes in AP waveform, also alters GABA release and paired-pulse depression at synapses made by PV onto pyramidal (PYR) neurons. The effects of Kv6.4 loss are amplified during high-frequency firing, within the physiological range of fast-spiking PV neurons, likely due to altered repolarization dynamics that accumulate across successive APs. These findings are thus consistent with the function of Kv6.4 in modifying Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier currents. Hence, Kv6.4 tunes the temporal precision of PV inhibitory output, a feature that may be critical for stable excitation-inhibition ratios and adaptive circuit function underlying learning and behavior. Significance Statement: Voltage-gated ion channels are broadly expressed yet serve cell-type-specific functions. We demonstrate that the Kv6.4 silent subunit is selectively expressed by fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory neurons among cortical neurons. In PV neurons, Kv6.4 modulates action potential (AP) waveform and GABA release onto excitatory neurons in a frequency-dependent manner, well within the physiological range of PV firing. This mechanism is likely important for preserving the temporal precision of inhibition, which is particularly critical for fast-spiking interneuron output. By shaping short-term synaptic plasticity during high-frequency firing, Kv6.4 provides a molecular and cell-type-specific mechanism for context-dependent tuning of inhibition within cortical circuits. This function may be especially relevant for sensory processing, experience-dependent plasticity, and the maintenance of excitation-inhibition ratios in vivo.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

During cancer progression, alterations in membrane trafficking are frequently observed. However, the mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of membrane trafficking in cancer progression remain largely unresolved. Recent evidence has demonstrated that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) employs a membrane trafficking program to coordinate cancer cell invasion and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). To further dissect the pro-tumorigenic membrane trafficking program, here we conducted a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in vivo screen for membrane trafficking regulators in a syngeneic mouse model with a complete immune system. This screen identified REEP2, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shaping protein, as a novel regulator of the EMT-dependent membrane trafficking program, which is associated with a poor prognosis in LUAD patients and is required for LUAD metastasis in a syngeneic orthotopic LUAD mouse model. Mechanistically, the EMT activator ZEB1 upregulates REEP2 expression through miR-183- and miR-193a-mediated regulation that promotes the transportation of secretory cargoes from the ER exit site (ERES) to the Golgi, thereby augmenting the secretion of pro-tumorigenic factors. The REEP2-driven secretion promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME. These findings identify REEP2 as a critical mediator of the EMT-driven pro-metastatic membrane trafficking program, revealing a specific vulnerability in mesenchymal LUAD.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

These mutualisms consist of food provisioning by plants and, their counterpart, plant propagule (seeds) movement by the animals, being crucial for the natural vegetation regeneration in many ecosystems. Yet we are far from understanding which part of this enormous interaction biodiversity is needed for their maintenance. I overview the diversity of interaction modes involved in these mutualisms, the main components of the seed dispersal services, and their functional diversity. I examine how interaction richness covaries with partner species richness at different scales, resulting in variable patterns of species complementarities in terms of seed dispersal effects. The functionality of most generalized plant-frugivore mutualisms relies on complementarity of effects across a high diversity of partners, yet frequently depends on just a distinct subset of them, resulting in high functional redundancy. Two distinct aspects are relevant: 1) variable quantitative effects among species; 2) variable pairwise-interaction outcomes, between the extremes of antagonism and mutualism. Frugivory, occurring at the final stage of each plant reproductive episode, entails a large, cumulative, effect of other biotic interactions occurring at earlier stages (e.g., floral herbivory, pollination, pre-dispersal fruit damage). I examine how plant-frugivore interactions mix- up with the whole biotic interactome of a plant, using the Prunus mahaleb system as a case study.

Sexual conversion rates were assessed with a newly developed ex vivo sexual conversion assay (evSCA) in HBB genotypes HbAA, HbAC, and HbAS, and an in vitro SCA (ivSCA) using the NF54-gexp02-Tom sexual conversion reporter line cultured in red blood cells (RBCs) with HbAA, HbAC, HbAS, HbSS, and HbSC genotypes. IgG and IgM responses against trophozoite- and stage I gametocyte-infected RBC surface antigens were quantified by flow cytometry in plasma from individuals with HbAA, HbAC, HbAS, HbCC, and HbSC genotypes. Growth in HBB mutant RBCs significantly increased sexual conversion rates in both ex vivo and in vitro assays, while humoral responses did not differ between HBB mutant and wild-type individuals. These results demonstrate that HBB mutations enhance sexual conversion independently of IgG- and IgM-mediated immunity, highlighting a host-genetic factor that may influence malaria transmission potential.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

How these rules are mechanistically implemented, however, varies widely across species and remains poorly understood. Here, using quantitative 3D live imaging, mechanical and biochemical manipulations, we dissect the mechanisms governing centrosomal complex (CC) migration and spindle orientation in ascidian 2-cell stage embryos to generate the characteristic planar, square 4-cell stage. We show that following the first mitotic division, CCs in the two blastomeres form at variable orientations relative to the mother spindle and progressively achieve parallel and coplanar alignment during interphase of the 2-cell stage. Final spindle orientation is established prior to nuclear envelope breakdown, contrasting with dynamic spindle reorientation reported in other systems.\n\nOur analyses reveal that CC rotation is driven by forces acting on long astral microtubules and guided by an anisotropic, ER-rich cytoplasmic domain that surrounds the CCs. This ER domain correlates with a dense astral microtubule network, enabling length-dependent microtubule pulling that orients the CCs independently of cell shape. In parallel, dynein-mediated cortical pulling refines spindle tilt and maintains coplanarity. Together, these findings uncover a cell-cycle-regulated tug-of-war between ER-mediated cytoplasmic forces and anisotropic cortical forces that ensures robust planar cleavage in ascidian early embryos.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, we show that systemic CD74 deletion in a syngeneic melanoma model significantly delayed tumor growth and reshaped the tumor immune microenvironment, and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade. Tumors in Cd74-/- mice had more effector and memory CD8+ T cells producing IFN-{gamma} and granzyme B than in control mice. Loss of CD74 promoted expansion of migratory cDC1s with elevated MHC-I and CCR7 expression. Cd74-/- professional antigen presenting cells increased cross-priming capacity for tumor-derived antigens in vivo and in vitro. Absence of CD74 induced the expression of CCR7, a key lymph node homing molecule, on cDCs and enhanced their ability to migrate towards the CCL19 ligand in single cell tracking analyses.

Loss of MCL-1 results in embryonic-lethal neurodevelopmental defects that cannot be rescued by other anti-apoptotic proteins of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family. Here, we pharmacologically inhibit MCL-1 in human neural stem cells and find non-apoptotic roles for MCL-1 in sustaining mitochondrial cristae integrity, fatty acid oxidation, and neural progenitor identity. MCL-1 inhibition disrupts mitochondrial ultrastructure, leading to swollen mitochondria with disorganized cristae and destabilization of the OPA1-MICOS machinery that maintains inner membrane architecture. These structural defects are accompanied by impaired lipid droplet accumulation and altered expression of {beta}-oxidation enzymes, revealing a tight link between cristae architecture and metabolic competence. Functionally, in the absence of caspase-mediated cell death, MCL-1 inhibition selectively depletes intermediate progenitor cells without affecting proliferation, indicating a direct role in lineage progression.

Building on our previous work showing that cooler temperature enhances hnRNPH1 binding to RBM3 pre-mRNA and drives poison exon (PE) skipping, we now identify RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) remodelling as the principal cis-acting mechanism underlying this temperature-sensitive regulation. Using small-molecule stabilizers and destabilizers, we show that rG4 folding reduces PE skipping, whereas rG4 destabilization enhances hnRNPH1-mediated PE exclusion. These effects are conserved across neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Integrating proteomics, phosphoproteomics, kinase perturbation assays, and candidates emerging from our prior genome-wide CRISPR screen, we further uncover contributions from temperature-sensitive CDC2-like kinase signalling and the RNA helicase DDX5, a known rG4 resolver and an hnRNPH1/hnRNPF co-factor. Together, our findings establish rG4 remodelling as the dominant driver of hnRNPH1-dependent RBM3 splicing, while implicating helicase activity and kinase signalling as modulatory layers that fine-tune this response.

During placodal invagination, the OP also produces several classes of migratory neurons, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons, terminal nerve (TN) neurons, and olfactory pioneer neurons, the latter of which are thought to play a key role in initiating olfactory bulb development. Despite decades of research, the genetic lineage and molecular identity of the various neuronal types that arise from the OP remain under investigation. The GnRH-1 neurons play essential roles in reproduction as well as chemodetection; however, they appear to have a distinct genetic lineage from olfactory and vomeronasal chemosensory neurons. The Golgi-associated olfactory signaling regulator (Goofy/Gfy) is known to be expressed in developing chemosensory neurons. To determine whether the expression of this gene is specific to the neurons of the nasal chemosensory epithelia or a common feature of OP derivatives, we characterized its expression and lineage at both embryonic and postnatal stages. Our results confirm broad expression across developing chemosensory neurons and by subsets of olfactory pioneer neurons. However, our data show that the GnRH-1 neurons do not express Gfy and suggest only sparse expression across the putative TN neurons.

Using live-cell fluorescence lifetime imaging, in vitro reconstitution and micromanipulation we show that EVs from diverse pathogens - Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus - fuse with host plasma, phagosomal, and lysosomal membranes. This fusion increases membrane tension and perturbs early phagosomal maturation. Transcriptomic profiling confirms a broad downregulation of phagosome maturation genes while upregulation of lysosomal stress responsive genes. Crucially, in vitro reconstitution shows that EVs, and their purified lipids alone, are sufficient to induce phase separation and increase membrane tension, directly inhibiting phago-lysosomal fusion. Our findings establish a paradigm in which pathogens exploit EVs not merely as delivery vehicles, but as tools to remotely rewire host cell membrane mechanics to hijack phagosome maturation and host defense - a strategy that moves beyond canonical effector-based models of pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

In plants, radial organ growth is mediated by the cambium, a stem cell niche deeply embedded in expanding organs and continuously producing xylem and phloem in a strictly bidirectional manner.

Despite the topological consistency of CSC divisions and the functional importance of proper division plane orientation for CSC derivatives, the regulatory mechanisms behind this consistency remain unknown. Here, we characterized microtubule organization during CSC divisions in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that division plane orientation is established independently from spindle orientation and the preprophase band (PPB). This conclusion is based on the remarkable variability of spindle orientation during metaphase and the robustness of CSC divisions in PPB-deficient mutants. Instead, the orientation of division planes depends on the cortical division zone (CDZ) and CDZ-related PHRAGMOPLAST ORIENTING KINESIN (POK) proteins.

Despite this complexity, genetic studies have identified more than 150 candidate genes that increase risk for autism and related neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. Unsurprisingly, synaptic genes are a large proportion of these genes, likely due to their roles in the formation and maintenance of synaptic architecture, function, and the plasticity of neurons and circuits. The association of synaptic genes with autism and similar conditions is driven by all types of genetic variation, including inherited and de novo rare variants that have unknown impacts on the function of the gene. Here we insert 4 conserved rare variants in the C. elegans orthologs of NLGN4X, NRXN1, and SHANK3, and define their impact on gene function compared to known loss of function variants using behavioral assays. We find that the rare variants impact multiple foraging behaviors, with each gene and variant having a unique pattern of behavioral changes and functional impact. The NLGN4X(A283T) variant induced clear loss of function, while NLGN4X(G84R) induces a loss of function in one behavior, but a gain of function in another behavior. The NRXN1(L18Q) variant induced remarkable loss and gain of functions with distinct impacts across each behavior. The SHANK3(L143P) variant induced partial loss of function in a single behavior. We also identify for the first time that loss of function of shn-1/SHANK3 alters social feeding and food response behaviors. We uncover a remarkably complex impact of rare variants in synaptic genes, with differential impacts across behaviors, highlighting the importance of broad behavioral analysis and the nuanced effects of missense variants compared to loss of function alleles.

Understanding how the brain implements distinct temporal architectures for momentary versus persistent affective phenomena is important to comprehending emotional processing and developing objective biomarkers for psychiatric conditions. Here, we introduced a multimodal approach combining automated facial expression monitoring and continuous intracranial electroencephalography in 2,037 electrode contacts across 16 epilepsy patients, over multiple days. Of these, 15 and 12 patients met criteria for facial expression and for mood analysis, respectively. Among patients meeting criteria, we captured 1,396 naturalistic smiles, and 3,746 neutral expressions, separated by at least 10 seconds, alongside 336 periodic mood assessments. This paradigm revealed distinct behavioral and neural computational architectures. Aperiodic neural activity in the lateral temporal cortex (79.5% accuracy) encoded facial expressions with high cross-participant generalizability. Mood states, however, showed different encoding patterns. Facial expressions provided no consistent mood indicators across participants. Critically, low-gamma power dynamics in limbic regions encoded mood states in only a subset of individuals (5 of 12 participants) with expression-mood behavioral correlations, suggesting a distinct encoding phenotype. Cross-domain analysis confirmed computational independence: neural features optimized for facial expression decoding failed to predict sustained mood states, and vice versa. These findings suggest that multiple neural mechanisms may influence underlying affective processing, with variations in their contributions between individuals.

Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this adaptation involves recurrent cortical circuits through cooperative amplification and competitive interactions within functional networks. Recent studies in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) have begun to support this idea, consistent with novel circuit motifs whereby excitatory and inhibitory cells are strongly connected. Despite these advancements, neither models or data provide a clear picture of the behavior of cortical columns within circuits with functional topography. Here, neighboring cells (excitatory and inhibitory) are selective for similar features in visual space, raising the question as to whether cortical columns act as amplifiers or engage in feature competition. Moreover, columnar network models make a strong prediction: cortical circuits should engage in functional amplification during weak sensory drive, transitioning to suppressive interactions with increasing sensory drive-a prediction not yet directly tested. Using single-cell perturbations in ferret V1, we show that cortical networks switch between amplification and suppression, depending on stimulus strength. Combining two-photon optogenetic stimulation with a generalized linear model (GLM) to quantify perturbations, we uncovered spatially broad suppressive influence modulated by stimulus contrast. At low contrast, we observed amplification between functionally-coupled cells. At high contrast, these networks switched to suppression. This reversal emerged in a recurrent network model with strong inhibitory-excitatory connectivity and weaker excitatory-excitatory connections. This class of models predicts markedly stronger suppressive influences from inhibitory cells onto excitatory populations, which we confirmed with cell-specific perturbations.

Analyzing heterogeneity is a foundational challenge across the natural and social sciences, from ecology and medicine to economics.

Inspired by the modular design of the ISO Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model--the architectural basis of todays Internet--we propose a Three-Layer Heterogeneity Analysis (3-LHA) methodology. Its layers include: (i) a definitions/metrics layer, specifying node- and network-level heterogeneity measures along with scaling metrics; (ii) a statistical tests layer, incorporating bootstrapping to partition heterogeneous and random clusters, and permutation tests for node- and network-level heterogeneity comparisons; and (iii) an applications layer, supporting tasks such as identifying keystone species via rich and heterogeneous clubs, detecting biomarkers, and analyzing heterogeneity-stability relationships. We demonstrate 3-LHA using the global Earth Microbiome Project dataset. The framework inherits the core strengths of its inspiration--modularity, scalability, and cross-domain interoperability--forming a generalizable analytical stack. Although illustrated here with ecological data, 3-LHA is readily applicable to central heterogeneity problems in other fields, such as profiling tumor ecosystems in oncology or modeling household behavior in economics, offering a unified and scalable approach to a pervasive scientific challenge.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

These morphologically-striking structures are present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus and display quantitative alterations in a variety of physiological and pathological contexts. The functional significance and protein composition of Reinke crystals have remained elusive for over a century. Here, we demonstrate that Reinke crystals are intensely immunoreactive for inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS), two key enzymes in the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides. IMPDH and PRPS are two of several metabolic enzymes that is capable of forming mesoscale filamentous aggregates as a mechanism to regulate enzyme activity. IMPDH is also able to form crystals in cellulo. Our observations link Reinke crystal formation to purine nucleotide metabolism in Leydig cells. We discuss how this novel finding may relate to the unique dependence of Leydig cells on GTP for testosterone synthesis. The results of this preliminary study may have important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying disorders of male reproductive health as well as offering a novel histological biomarker for Leydig cell neoplasms. Moreover, we have previously demonstrated similar IMPDH/PRPS structures in the human brain, suggesting that this phenomenon may have broad biological relevance across tissue types.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear if lack of meaningful social interactions represents a cause or a symptom of disease. In rodents, social isolation leads to metabolic dysregulation, however the dynamics and contributing factors remain poorly understood. Here we show that single-housing young adult male mice for at least three weeks led to fasting hyperglycemia, an effect that was maintained for the duration of single-housing, but was corrected within a week of reverting mice to co-housing conditions. Single-housing did not affect glucose regulation in females. Gonadectomy experiments revealed that testicular factors induced susceptibility to social isolation, as orchiectomy prevented isolation-induced fasting hyperglycemia in males. We did not find a protective role for ovarian hormones, as ovariectomized females were as resilient as intact females to isolation-induced fasting hyperglycemia. To understand the underlying mechanisms for susceptibility to isolation, we measured plasma levels of glucoregulatory hormones. Isolation did not affect the levels of insulin, epinephrine, and corticosterone. However, glucagon levels were distinctly modulated by social isolation in intact and orchiectomized mice. Social isolation induces increased immediate early gene expression in specific neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus, a glucoregulatory brain structure that promotes glucagon release. Taken together, our findings show that testicular hormones make males susceptible to isolation-induced disruption of glucose regulation and suggest that brain glucoregulatory neurons play a role.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

However, the general principles governing the compatibility of amino acid sequences in living cells remain unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluated the neutrality--a measure of harmful versus beneficial properties--of simple amino acid homorepeats composed of ten identical residues (Poly10X), using yeast as an experimental model system. EGFP-Poly10X fusions were analyzed using the genetic tug-of-war (gTOW) method to quantify maximum expression levels, revealing amino-acid-specific neutrality values. Hydrophobic repeats (I, V, W, F, Y) were strongly harmful and aggregation-prone, whereas hydrophilic repeats (E, S, N, Q) alleviated harmfulness. These trends were conserved across protein backgrounds and structural contexts. Consistently, hydrophobic repeats such as Poly10I formed aggregates and were intrinsically harmful, whereas Poly10E suppressed protein aggregation and prevented activation of proteotoxic stress responses. Furthermore, analysis of PolyX occurrence across the proteomes of multiple species revealed a strong correlation between experimentally measured Poly10X neutrality and both the length and frequency of homorepeats in natural proteins. Hydrophobic amino acids were rarely observed as homorepeats, whereas residues such as E, N, Q, and S appeared frequently and were beneficial in our assays. Taken together, Poly10X neutrality serves as an experimental measure of amino acid tolerance in cells and defines the compatible sequence space of proteins. It explains the absence of certain homorepeats in nature and has implications for protein design and mutation-induced harmfulness.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Chronic Neuropixels recordings in mouse visual cortex revealed that each neuron was coupled to the local population with a characteristic strength and delay. Stimulus responses formed a sequence where neuronal participation depended on tuning, but delay was fixed. This sequence interacted multiplicatively with the rate code, appeared even during spontaneous activity, and remained stable for weeks.

We constructed a model that describes the electric field close to the cortical patch given the neural activity that generates it. This revealed that field-to-neuron interactions (ephaptic coupling strength) was stronger that neuron-to-field and it correlated trial by trial changes in oscillatory power.

In particular, the loss of excitatory signalling from Merkel cells during aging causes the degeneration of subsets of molecularly defined inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the dorsal spinal cord, including inhibitory neurons that express the neuropeptide NPY.

We found that visual input elicits diverse ER calcium signals, with the ER acting as a calcium sink or source depending on the cell type, subcellular compartment (dendrite versus axon), and type of visual stimulus. ER calcium signals were not simply a reflection of cytosolic signals, indicating that the ER, rather than acting as a passive calcium buffer, actively processes calcium signals in neurons in a context-specific fashion.

Of the genes associated with PD, Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has previously been proposed to play a role in neuroinflammation. However, the extent to which LRRK2 is involved in endogenous inflammatory signaling is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether endogenous mutations in LRRK2 affect responses to neuroinflammation in vivo. METHODS: We injected cohorts of mice with knock-in mutations in Lrrk2, homologous to those causing human PD, with a single intrastriatal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or control. We used single cell RNA-Sequencing to examine cell type specific responses to treatment and genotype and validated key results with orthogonal approaches. RESULTS: We found that our chosen paradigm of acute LPS exposure evokes robust transcriptional changes consistent with a multicellular neuroinflammatory response. We also found evidence of peripheral immune cell recruitment into the brain and interaction with brain-resident microglia. However, the transcriptional effects of Lrrk2 mutations were limited to small numbers of genes, including down regulation of gene ontogeny terms related to lysosomes, in microglia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data clearly demonstrate that many cells in the brain respond to a single inflammatory insult with strong transcriptional responses and that, even in a model focused on CNS injection, there is interaction between peripheral and central immune cells. In contrast, the quantitative effects of Lrrk2 mutations are modest at the transcriptional level, demonstrating that additional studies are needed to clarify whether Lrrk2 mutations affect neuroinflammation in an endogenous context.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

While the encoding properties of these instructive signals have been characterized extensively in trained animals, it is unclear how they are shaped by learning across both slow and fast timescales. Here, we use longitudinal 2-photon calcium imaging to record the dynamics of climbing fiber inputs across multiple cerebellar lobules as mice learn to execute a visuomotor integration task - slow learning - and must then rapidly adapt to a new sensorimotor coupling - fast learning. Instructive signals are spatially segregated in trained mice: Lobule V preferentially encodes movement predictively, while Lobule simplex preferentially receives reward-related feedback. Moreover, the encoding of sensorimotor and reward-related instructive signals is dynamic on both slow and fast timescales: movement-related activity emerges over the course of training, while reward-related activity progressively diminishes as mice become experts but re-emerges specifically in Lobule simplex when rewards become scarce. Finally, while the same climbing fiber inputs can change on both timescales, the magnitude and spatial organization of slow changes are not related to fast changes. Thus, climbing fiber inputs convey common yet complementary instructive signals that are dynamically shaped by learning on multiple time scales through distinct processes.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

The molecular regulation behind this intricate temporal patterning remains elusive. We undertook in-depth single-cell multi-omics analyses, discovering a two-layered regulatory framework at the core of this process. Central to this are global temporal regulators positioned above a temporal network, consisting of series of transcriptional factor (TF) hub groups under sequential state transitions. This temporal network operates not by restricting TF expressions to discrete temporal windows, but through coordinated transcriptional and chromatin-accessibility dynamics that modulate transient TF regulatory activity. Moreover, global temporal regulators specify the duration of each cascading stage and, consequently, the number of progenies generated at each stage. Loss of global temporal regulators protracts RGP lineage progression, whereas their increased activity accelerates it. These findings suggest a two-layer temporal regulatory system controlling RGP lineage progression and neural progeny output duality in mammalian neocortical development.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

From this data set, we selected 107 congeneric pairs and fit a logistic curve to the abundance ratio versus elevation data to estimate the width of transition zone over which the species ratio changes from 90% to 10%. We found that the distribution of the transition widths range from < 50 m (about a quarter of the pairs) to more than 500 m.

Considering all measured traits combined, environment explained the largest variance (30%), followed by genotype-by-environment interactions (18%) and genotype effects (9%), indicating substantial heritable plasticity.

Although these dynamics often appear reproducible at coarse taxonomic or functional scales, the mechanisms governing fine-grained species-level variation and the emergence of alternative stable states remain an unresolved problem in ecology. Bridging the gap between individual species variability and the emergence of predictable community-level attractors is essential for a mechanistic understanding of ecosystem resilience. Here, by analyzing replicate microbial communities assembled in vitro, we demonstrate that community structure is built upon individual species exhibiting robustly bimodal abundance distributions. Each taxon exists in either a high- or low-abundance state. We show that the collective configuration of these binary species states - a phenomenon also observed in natural systems - drives the correlation structure between community members and defines a set of discrete, alternative community-level attractors. By examining the prevalence of species across these attractors, we uncover a striking taxonomic signal: phylogenetically close relatives are significantly more likely to display reciprocal prevalence patterns - where the dominance of one relative necessitates the suppression of the other - than expected by chance. This discovery directly rejects models based on simple functional redundancy. Instead, it proves that state-dependent competitive exclusion is a primary driver of community divergence, where the identity of the ``winner'' is contingent on the collective state of the entire community.

Using a randomized 2+20% sampling design, more than 4,000 autonomous recording units generated over 2 million hours of acoustic data analyzed with convolutional neural networks, enabling statistically rigorous inference at regional and range-wide scales. This report summarizes 2024 field efforts and analytical advancements in the context of recent peer-reviewed and in-progress studies. Updated analyses confirm persistent, low occupancy of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), with detections concentrated in the Klamath Mountains and southern Cascades, consistent with long-term demographic declines. Range-wide models of barred owl (Strix varia) landscape use continue to show high occupancy across much of the NWFP area, reinforcing competitive displacement as the dominant driver of spotted owl range contraction. The PAM network also advanced monitoring of marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), with 2024 results supporting PAM as a cost-efficient alternative to traditional audio-visual surveys for assessing inland nesting habitat use in coastal forests. Beyond focal species, the program increasingly supports multi-taxa biodiversity monitoring through bioacoustic bycatch and soundscape analyses, linking species occurrence, habitat condition, and disturbance dynamics. Collectively, 2024 results demonstrate that PAM has reached operational maturity as the cornerstone of Phase II NWFP effectiveness monitoring.

Field collections included both managed and wild colonies of A. mellifera, A. cerana, A. dorsata, A. florea, and A. andreniformis from peninsular Malaysia, as well as two additional cavity-nesting species of Borneo A. koschevnikovi and A. nuluensis. Species identification was performed based on morphological features, nesting ecology, and subsequently validated through sequencing. Samples collected from peninsular Malaysia showed congruence between field/morphological and molecular identification. In contrast, cavity-nesting bees from Borneo exhibited overlapping morphological characteristics leading to misidentification of species. These findings suggest the reliability of carrying out field-based identification of honey bees in peninsular Malaysia but requires molecular validation for Borneo region. The limitations of morphology-based interpretation for Borneo cavity-nesting bees highlights the need for more population-level and speciation studies on these species.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

H.-L.; Irvine, Z.; Vasu, A. L.; Planincic, E.; Yek, S. H.", "abstract": "Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is a parasitoid fungus that predominantly infects ants from the Camponotini tribe, inducing behavioural changes to enhance its survival and reproduction. The most notable change occurs during the final infection phase, where the infected ant leaves its nest to perform the \"death grip\", hanging upside down and biting onto a substrate to anchor itself. In the tropics, these infected ants congregate at specific locations known as zombie graveyards, which have optimal conditions for spore dispersal. This study examines the spatial dynamics of known graveyards at a national park in Borneo, Malaysia, by assessing existing sites and identifying new ones. We located old graveyards at Night Walk and Paku Trail and discovered a new one at Botany Loop. The density of ant cadavers per quadrat increased slightly, from 1-3 ants/m2 to 2-4 ants/m2. While the graveyard size at Night Walk remained similar, Paku Trail experienced a nearly two-fold reduction, decreasing from 197 m2 to 97 m2. At Night Walk, three ant hosts were identified, with Colobopsis leonardi being the dominant ant host across all graveyards. Without genetic tests, we could not confirm whether the same O. unilateralis infects all ants in the graveyards. Our findings suggest a general site fidelity of zombie graveyards, with hotspot densities varying spatially, potentially influenced by microclimatic changes. Long-term monitoring of graveyard dynamics is essential for understanding natural infections and the effects of environmental conditions on parasitoid-host ecology.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

This study examines the floristic composition, phytosociological attributes, successional stage, and phylogenetic diversity of three adjacent forest environments within Cantareira State Park, southeastern Brazil, one of the largest remnants of Atlantic Forest. Across 0.525 ha, we sampled 768 individuals, representing 92 species, 65 genera, and 42 families. Species richness was highest in environments B and C (56 species each) and lowest in A (42 species). Tree ferns (Cyathea phalerata and Dicksonia sellowiana) dominated the waterlogged environment A, while environment B was characterized by early secondary canopy trees and shade-tolerant understory species, and environment C by late secondary species such as Ocotea catharinensis and Micropholis crassipedicellata. Clustering analyses integrating floristic, structural, successional, and phylogenetic data revealed that environment C was consistently distinct, whereas A and B showed partial overlap due to shared edaphic conditions. Successional classification indicated apparent differences among environments, but the presence of mature forest indicators, including well-developed tree ferns and late secondary species, suggests that all three environments represent stable, mature forests shaped by contrasting soil and drainage conditions. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing edaphic climax communities within forest mosaics and caution against relying solely on successional stage classifications in conservation planning.

Predation being a ubiquitous interaction with potentially strong demographic and selective effects, it is likely to alter how prey respond to a changing environment. However, whether and how adaptation in prey depends on the way selection operates on predators remains little understood. We here investigate this question by combining the theory of adaptive tracking of a moving optimum with trait-matching predator-prey coevolution. We first show that, when scaling up individual-level processes to the population level, prey maladaptation in any environment is non-linear with respect to the divergence between the prey's and predator's optimum, contrary to the predictions from most earlier coevolutionary models. In a fluctuating environment, the influence of a selective predator on tracking of the moving optimum by the prey crucially depends on whether and how the predator itself evolves. In particular, a predator that tracks the same optimum facilitates adaptive tracking in prey, while a predator selected towards a fixed optimum hampers it. When eco-evolutionary dynamics are also allowed, the reduced population size of phenotypically mismatched predators decreases the strength of predatory selection and the intensity of coevolution, but the qualitative influence of predators on prey adaptation remains otherwise similar. Our findings highlight the importance of the evolutionary context of predators for their impacts on prey, and challenge conservation strategies based on predatory attenuation.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Mutation rate computation from these assays relies on a mathematical model describing the emergence of mutants during population growth. However, this standard model relies on restrictive assumptions that are often transgressed in real biological setups. Key assumptions include equal growth rate of the wild-type and the mutant population, no cell death during growth phase, and no post-growth sampling. Although several refined mathematical models have been proposed over the last decades to circumvent some of these assumptions, none can fully account for the complex ecological scenarios frequently observed in the lab or in the wild, such as combination of cell death and unknown fitness effect of the mutation, or non-constant death rates. In this work, we propose to replace these standard mathematical models by a stochastic simulation framework, which can circumvent all these assumptions. We provide a fast and accurate implementation of this stochastic model, and use it to perform simulation-based, likelihood-free parameter inference through the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Beyond mutation rate estimation, our approach can simultaneously infer additional biological parameters, provided enough experimental replicates are available. We benchmarked our proposed method against the most recent tools (rSalvador, Flan, and mlemur) in a broad range of biological scenarios with randomly sampled parameter sets. We found that that our method has similar accuracy than existing tools in simple conditions where these tools work, but also reliably estimates mutation rate and some other parameters in more complex conditions where other tools do not work.

In this study, we set out to determine whether the presence and/or the types of conspecifics an individual female encounters influences her subsequent reproductive behaviour and patterns of egg production. In our assay, we housed medium-sized adult virgin females in experimental social treatments; either in isolation, or with other conspecific females (that were either of large- or small- body size) to observe how the presence and/or type of social interactions altered later reproductive decisions and outcomes. While in some instances female flies behaved differently depending on their housing treatment, these responses were not particularly consistent between flies obtained from different populations, nor with previously described patterns.

While some types of symbioses evolved multiple times across space and time (e.g., oxygenic photosymbioses or chemosymbioses), others are extremely rare. Purple photosymbioses are an example of such rare associations. Only two purple photosymbioses between heterotrophic eukaryotes and intracellular purple bacteria have been documented. This is in stark contrast to very common oxygenic photosymbioses and poses the question of what factors prevent the more frequent establishment of purple photosymbioses. To shed light on this question, we investigated the evolutionary history of the purple-green ciliate Pseudoblepharisma tenue (Spirostomidae) using a phylogenetic and comparative approach. We sampled about 30 new isolates of spirostomid ciliates, inferred a comprehensive and well-supported phylogenomic tree, and resolved the sister relationship between Pseudoblepharisma and Spirostomum. Furthermore, we characterized P. tenues sister species, here renamed Pseudoblepharisma chlorelligera, and revealed that it constitutes a quadripartite symbiosis between a ciliate, a green alga, and two different non-photosynthetic bacteria. In addition, we discovered three colorless, non-photosymbiotic Pseudoblepharisma species, which branch as sister to the photosymbiotic P. tenue and P. chlorelligera. Our phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses suggest that the green algal symbionts of P. tenue predated the acquisition of purple bacterial symbionts, and that the ancestor of the extant Pseudoblepharisma species was non-photosymbiotic and facultatively anaerobic. These data allowed us to hypothesize on the evolutionary steps that led to the origin of P. tenue and thus bring us closer to explaining the conditions that led to the evolutionary emergence of a unique purple-green symbiosis.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

A.; Buesse, S.; Hammel, J.; van de Kamp, T.; Tribull, C.", "abstract": "Prey capture is a key selection pressure, often favoring extreme performance morphologies. Many mechanisms of prey capture, however, remain poorly understood. In this study, we document the remarkable raptorial behavior and evolutionary biomechanics of the \"pincer wasps\" (Hymenoptera: Dryinidae). Dryinid claws, previously thought to function as simple vises (Nachtigall-&-Nachtigall-1974), are shown to possess \"snap traps\", or claws that close rapidly upon prey contact. Detailed morphological analysis, using synchrotron-radiation microtomography (SR--CT), reveals that all long-clawed dryinids can overcenter their specialized anterior pretarsal claws, presumably allowing elastic energy storage in the pretarsal apodemes. Uniquely, explosive release of this energy, leading to claw closure, appears to occur not through active withdrawal of a latch, but as the direct consequence of contact with the prey: impact hyperextends a specialized trigger-joint complex of the tarsus, pulling the claw back into undercenter alignment, and so freeing the stretched apodeme to fully recoil. Such a \"contact trigger\" is eminently useful, as these trap-claw wasps prey on insects with explosive jump capacity; by linking trap shutting with prey contact, success chances are increased. Paleontological and allometric analyses suggest that the raptorial behavior likely preceded the evolution of overcentering, which appears to have evolved via release from developmental constraint on anteroposterior symmetry, leading to a distinct scaling rule. These findings expand the documented diversity of spring-loaded biological mechanisms and establish Dryinidae as a promising system for studying how developmental constraints, mechanical demands, and functional innovation shape ecomorphological diversity.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

However, exactly which life-history traits best approximate an individual's long-term genetic contributions remains poorly studied, especially in cooperative breeders. Here, we use a genetic pedigree and long-term data of the closed population of the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) to calculate the expected individual genetic contributions (IGC) after 15 years (or ~3 generations) across 11 cohorts. Using a Bayesian analysis, we then quantified and compared how well six important life-history traits predict IGC in each sex of this cooperatively breeding species. The life-history traits compared were: acquisition of a dominant breeding position, age at first breeding attempt, tenure as a dominant breeder, lifespan, and LRS (measured as both the number of independent [surviving 3 months+] and recruited [surviving 1 year+] offspring produced over an individual's lifetime). An individual's lifetime reproductive success (LRS) was the strongest predictor of IGC, and this predictive power did not differ across the different measurements used. However, this predictive power did differ between sexes, explaining ~61-62% of IGC variation in males versus ~47-49% in females, owing to the larger variation among males in their annual reproductive success. Across other life-history traits, the predictive power of IGC was similar across both sexes but differed between life-history traits considerably (2-37%). Comparing these predictive powers suggested that lifespan and the duration of a dominant breeding position are far more important in shaping long-term genetic contributions than if and when in their life they acquired dominance. Overall, these findings give insight into the individual and population-level processes influencing future gene pools and illustrate how life-history evolution is shaped by sex-specific reproductive patterns and cooperative breeding dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

While egg production depends on adult performance, the biology of adult BSF remains poorly understood. In particular, growing evidence suggests that adults can feed and benefit from sugar supplementation but the behavioural and molecular bases of sugar detection remain unknown. To fill this gap, we tested whether adult BSF can detect and prefer sugar by using behavioural assays, binary-choice feeding tests and proboscis extension responses. We also described numerous gustatory sensilla on the proboscis with scanning electron microscopy, and characterized the responses to sugar in some of them with electrophysiological recordings. These experiments were complemented by an analysis of the gustatory receptor (GR) gene repertoire and the expression levels of sugar-responsive receptors. All the experimental tests conducted in this study converge to show that the adults can detect and consume sucrose, with females responding more strongly than males. Genome analysis identified 28 GRs, a surprisingly small number for a generalist fly, including only three putative sugar-specific GRs homologous to those of the eight known sugar GRs in Drosophila. Moreover, one of these GRs show a general high level of expression including in the head and in the antennae whereas the two others display tissue-specific patterns of expression. We also identify a high number of GR pseudogenes, including four putative sugar receptor pseudogenes, indicating multiple gene loss events and substantial reduction of the GR repertoire compared to other dipteras sharing a similar ecological niche. We conclude that although BSF possesses a reduced set of GR genes, including only three putative sugar-responsive GRs, adults have retained a strong sensitivity to sugars in their environment.

Here, we analyze single-copy orthologs between species pairs in Drosophila and mammals to quantify taxon-specific rates and magnitudes of expression divergence, assess the influence of genome architecture, and evaluate tissue-specific and functional patterns. Using a computational framework that predicts expression divergence and species-specific expression optima, we identify markedly higher divergence rates in Drosophila than in mammals, consistent with theoretical expectations and prior empirical work. Contrary to expectations, genes located in nested structures, in which one gene lies entirely within the intron of another, were no more likely to diverge than unnested genes in either taxon. However, when divergence occurred in Drosophila, nested genes exhibited larger shifts in expression optima, with the strongest effects among internal genes. Divergence rates were also higher among young than old nested genes in both taxa, although magnitudes of expression shifts were indistinguishable, suggesting that nesting contributes to early regulatory instability but does not typically trigger large regulatory changes. Tissue-level and functional analyses further revealed taxon- and architecture-specific signatures of expression divergence, including contrasting patterns across reproductive and neural tissues, as well as enrichment of core regulatory processes among unnested genes and enrichment of drug and xenobiotic metabolism among nested genes in Drosophila.

We extensively benchmark Classpose against 3 other state-of-the-art methods (Semantic Cellpose-SAM, CellViT++, and Stardist) across 6 datasets (CoNIC, ConSep, GlySAC, MoNuSAC, NuCLS, and PUMA), showing that Classpose consistently outperforms all other methods. We show that training only subsets of parameters is insufficient to reach well-performing models, and that specific additions to the training protocol lead to improved performance. We also show that Classpose outperforms other methods in pairwise cross-dataset evaluation. We provide pre-trained models for cell phenotyping, and provide a command-line tool and a QuPath extension for whole slide image-wide cell phenotyping. Classpose provides accessible, fast and reliable cell phenotyping to the research community.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

This striking spatial distribution is believed to maximise the generation of superficial flows at the scale of the embryo. However, the specific role of regular MCC distribution and the physiological function of vigorous ciliary activity remain elusive. To investigate the extent to which superficial flows provide protection against external pathogens before the immune system matures, we combined experimental and computational approaches. First, we cultivated epithelial explants in order to quantify the distribution of MCCs, beating frequencies, and three-dimensional fluid flows. We then used these data to validate a computational fluid dynamics model. Using this model, seeded with structural data from whole embryos, our simulations reveal that the collective ciliary beatings create a robust liquid shield along the embryonic flank, which is highly effective at clearing pathogens from the vicinity of the epithelial surface. Through parametric analyses, we further demonstrate that this protective function is remarkably resilient. Indeed, the effectiveness of pathogen clearance is primarily governed by the overall characteristic velocity of the cilia and is less affected by moderate variations in MCC density and spatial organisation. Our findings suggest that, rather than optimising energy consumption, the biological system prioritises functional robustness to ensure reliable protection.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Although the negative correlation between yield and fiber quality is well recognized, the genomic structural basis driving this differentiation and its cascading effects on transcriptional regulation remain largely elusive. Here, we integrated multi-tissue transcriptomics with pan-genome structural variation analysis to explore the genomic mechanisms underlying this phenotypic divergence. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that while the transcriptional programs of vegetative organs are highly conserved between the two species, significant spatiotemporal expression remodeling occurred during key windows of fiber development. Specifically, G. barbadense maintained a highly active transcriptional network during the transition from fiber elongation to thickening (20 DPA), exhibiting unique \"delayed elongation\" transcriptional features. Further pan-genomic analysis identified a pair of key transcription factors-MYB111 (A12) and MYB93 (A11)-that underwent \"Reciprocal Homoeologous Replacement\" (RHR). Structural variation evidence indicates that G. hirsutum lost the elongation-promoting MYB111 via a physical deletion on chromosome A12, potentially leading to the premature termination of the elongation program. As an evolutionary trade-off, G. hirsutum specifically retained the root development-related MYB93 on chromosome A11, suggesting a potential strategy to optimize root system architecture for broad environmental adaptation. We propose that these genomic structural variations not only reshaped tissue-specific transcriptional networks (\"software\") but also serve as the fundamental genetic basis (\"hardware\") driving the differentiation between \"high yield\" and \"superior quality\" in cotton.

Previously, we showed evidence of a generationally heritable epigenetic memory at the cytochrome P450 1a (cyp1a) gene in wild Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) with acquired tolerance to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This memory leads to blunted induction of cyp1a by PAHs; this blunted response protects against PAH-induced cancer. Here, using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing in PAH-tolerant and -sensitive F. heteroclitus embryos, we show that PAH-tolerant embryos displayed reduced plasticity in DNA methylation response to PAH, as compared to PAH-sensitive embryos, that was not due to mutational loss of CpG sites. Notably, we observed population differences in DNA methylation of genes in pathways linked to the PAH tolerance phenotype, including aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) and voltage-gated potassium channel signaling, as well as developmental processes and energy metabolism. Specifically, we observed PAH-induced loss of cyp1a gene body methylation in PAH-sensitive but not-tolerant embryos. We observed similar patterns at cyp1b1, cyp1c1, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, ahrr, which show similarly blunted expression in response to PAH challenge. The reduced loss in genic methylation in tolerant embryos was correlated with greater induction of natural anti-sense RNA transcripts in cis (cis-NATs), which may regulate transcription of these genes. Our data support the existence of stable epigenetic responses to chronic environmental stressors in a natural experimental setting, with broad implications for natural or directed adaptation strategies for other populations.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we synthesize emerging molecular and physiological evidence linking microbial IAA to proline turnover during thermomorphogenesis. We propose that microbial IAA establishes a regulatory window in which proline metabolism transitions between early osmoprotective synthesis and later catabolism that fuels elongation and redox balance. This integration involves crosstalk between the HSP90-TIR1 auxin perception module, heat-responsive MPK-IAA8 signalling, mitochondrial redox regulators (SSR1, HSCA2), and hormonal interactions with abscisic acid and ethylene. We outlined four mechanistic hypotheses and associated experiments to test how microbial IAA modulates proline homeostasis.

B100 produced fewer, but larger tubers compared to B26, and both diploid lines produced tubers that are smaller than the tetraploid variety, Clearwater Russet.

Here, we test whether gene deletion preferentially removes weakly constrained, degenerating duplicates or instead eliminates functionally active duplicates as an adaptive genome streamlining process. To identify the evolutionary and functional factors that determine which duplicates are lost, we systematically analyzed 100 gene deletion events in Drosophila by integrating sequence, expression, interaction, and structural data. We uncovered a strong bias toward the loss of younger child copies among functionally unique duplicates, whereas no such bias was observed for redundant duplicates. Contrary to expectations under relaxed constraint, deleted unique genes evolve more slowly, show higher expression, engage in more protein-protein interactions, and do not exhibit elevated structural divergence or intrinsic disorder relative to redundant duplicates. When compared with single-copy genes, deleted unique genes display similar evolutionary rates, slightly lower expression, greater network connectivity, comparable structural divergence, and lower intrinsic disorder. These patterns suggest that deletion frequently targets functionally active rather than degenerate genes. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis that gene deletion in Drosophila can represent an adaptive process that removes transiently functional duplicates, promoting genome streamlining and regulatory stability.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

To accurately interrogate the genetics of adaptation and assess the adaptive capacity of a species requires also characterizing the ways other mechanisms, including geographic distance and population dynamics, shape genetic variation. Pecan is an ecologically, culturally, and economically important North American tree, and a broader understanding of the genetics of environment adaptation will aid pecan conservation, breeding, and commercial management. Here, we use an expansive set of more than 700 pecan genotypes in combination with the first haplotype-resolved genome assembly for pecan to assess species-wide genetic variation and evaluate environmental adaptation across the native distribution. We identify five gene pools in pecan, with the lowest diversity in southern gene pools, and present evidence that gene pools began differentiating during multiple glacial cycles. Using complementary genotype-environment association approaches, we infer species-wide patterns of environmental adaptation. With these results, we predict mismatches in adaptation for pecan genotypes to different environments, including future environment scenarios. We see that in all locations, present-day genotypes incur some level of predicted maladaptation to simulated future environments, but current genetic diversity may provide a valuable source of resilience to future conditions through assisted migration.

Despite widespread interest in their use for conditions marked by social impairments, including depression, anxiety, and anorexia nervosa, the influence of sex as a biological variable (SABV) on the prosocial effects of psychedelics remains poorly understood. Indeed, enhanced connectedness, sociability and empathy are common outcomes of psychedelic use and these have shaped human social structures for millennia. Here, we investigated the sex-specific effects of a single dose of psilocybin (1.5 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J mice on various aspects of social behaviours. We show an intriguing connection between huddling behaviour and body temperature acutely elicited by psilocybin that was restricted to females. We also observe temporally distinct patterns of social behaviour alterations in female mice, whereby enhanced preference for social novelty was observed after acute effects subsided (4 h post-administration), which was maintained for ~24 h. Longer-term, the impact of psilocybin was reversed and promoted preference for familiar over novel conspecifics when assessed 7d post-administration, which was associated with prolonged nucleus accumbens dopamine signalling during familiar sniffing. In males, psilocybin reduced stress-related behaviours at 24 h and increased preference for familiar conspecifics, along with blunted novelty-evoked dopamine responses at both 24 h and 7 days post-treatment. Both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors were involved in modulating these behaviours, though in sex-specific ways.

Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and time-lapse cell imaging, we show that type III collagen positions astrocytes at the boundary of the fibrotic matrix by activating the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G1 (ADGRG1) and its downstream effector RhoA. Blocking ADGRG1 genetically or pharmacologically allows astrocytes to enter the fibrotic matrix, resulting in a smaller scar, improved neuronal regeneration, and better motor recovery.

Hypoxic microenvironments drive dysfunctional vessel growth by upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, migratory signaling pathways, and glycolytic metabolism. These vessels are ineffective at draining interstitial fluid, resulting in secondary complications such as edema, increased inflammation, slowed wound healing, and, for cancer patients, increased risk of metastasis. Despite the potential benefits of normalizing lymphatic vasculature, most treatments for vascular normalization focus on blood vasculature, ignoring the unique properties of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Moreover, previous targets for vascular normalization center around vascular endothelial growth factors, which risk adverse side effects. To address these issues, we approached lymphatic normalization from a metabolic perspective. In this study, we investigated the impact of glutamine availability on factors critical to lymphangiogenesis, including glycolysis, cell proliferation, and migration. We found that increasing the concentration of glutamine in media results in increased lactate production and the expression of glycolytic genes HK2, GLUT1, and GLUT3 under hypoxia. The presence of glutamine also encouraged LEC proliferation, while blocking glutamine transport reduced lactate production, HK2 expression, and slowed collective LEC migration. In a 2D vessel formation assay, we found that glutamine increased vessel formation in normoxic conditions but lowered vessel connectivity in hypoxic conditions, reflecting the dysfunction seen in hypoxic diseases. However, attenuating glycolysis by blocking glutamine transport caused LECs to form longer, interconnected vascular networks.

In this study, we used neonatal patient-derived tracheal airway epithelial cells (nTAECs) in a three-dimensional air-liquid interface (ALI) model to show that hyperoxia reduces MPST protein abundance. We then examined how targeted MPST knockdown during ALI differentiation disrupts early epithelial differentiation and metabolic homeostasis. MPST loss in nTAECs induced early (ALI day 3) transcriptomic shifts involving mitochondrial metabolic pathways, epithelial differentiation programs, and stress-response signatures, with subsequent decrease in ciliated cell numbers during mid-differentiation phase (ALI day 7). Metabolic flux analysis revealed significantly reduced mitochondrial respiration without compensatory increase in glycolysis, indicating disrupted metabolic flexibility. Together, these data show that MPST is essential for maintaining mitochondrial metabolic integrity necessary for normal airway epithelial development.

We find that only WNT3 and WNT3A robustly induce mesodermal markers, while WNT6 and WNT8A do not.

By explicitly considering altitude, flight results in a sequence of soaring and gliding in the 3D space. We investigate how the cost of movement to an overall goal varies when birds use social information from others that are either fixed in space or moving collectively to the common goal, and under different risk-taking speed strategies, from slow and cautious to fast and risky. The value of social information is operationalised as energetic savings in units of basal metabolic rate. Under low predictability, agents with intermediate risk and high social-information use exhibit lowest movement costs, with up to 36% energy savings over asocial movement.

Mutations can alter the properties of such structures; for example, some mutations increase the stability of a functionally relevant structure at the expense of other structures' stability. Interestingly, the structural diversity that a sequence produces is correlated to the number of structures that it can access upon mutation. Thus, enhancing a structure's stability can lead to neutral confinement, an evolutionary dead end in which mutational access to novel structures is increasingly difficult. If structure is critical to biological function, how do RNA molecules escape neutral confinement? We developed a model in which an RNA molecule's function depends on binding to a ligand and we applied it to study sequences that fold according to RNA biophysics, also simulating their evolution. We identified effects that decrease the selective advantage of augmenting a structure's stability. By disfavouring evolution of highly stable structures and favouring the accumulation of genetic variation, these effects hinder neutral confinement.

However, how distinct bone compartments influence BC cell quiescence and endocrine therapy response remains unclear. Mechanistic insight has been hindered by limited access to human bone samples and by the lack of relevant human models that permit controlled manipulation of stromal compartments. Here, we developed a fully human, 3D bone-mimetic system for modular, controllable assembly of engineered osteoblastic (eON), vascularized (eVN), and vascularized osteoblastic (eVON) niche compositions. These niches were generated by perfusion culture of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) and/or human adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (hAT-SVF) cells within porous ceramic scaffolds. The resulting tissue microenvironments were then used as a substrate for the culture of an ER+ BC cell line, expressing a mutant reporter of p27 to monitor the quiescent status. We found that the eON enhanced BC cell proliferation, whereas the eVN was enriched in quiescent BC cells positive for NR2F1, a dormancy-associated transcription factor, and located near perivascular elements. Treatment with the selective ER degrader fulvestrant reduced BC cell numbers in vascularized niches (eVN and eVON) but not in eON, despite comparable receptor degradation. In summary, we developed a modular human platform for dissecting niche-specific regulation of BC quiescence, proliferation, and endocrine therapy response. The system can be further used to investigate perivascular niche-dependent mechanisms of BC cell dormancy and to guide the development of therapeutic strategies preventing recurrence in ER+ BC patients.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Despite their importance, we lack a clear understanding of how novel traits arise in symbiosis and how this diversity influences host ecology in natural populations. The aphid facultative symbiont Regiella insecticola is ideally suited to this question because of its strong lineage-specific variation in host benefits. By generating 20 high-quality genomes, we found that Regiella's evolution is driven largely by gene gains mediated by mobile genetic elements. We identified a plasmid (pRILSR1) that encodes a type IV secretion system and a highly expressed predicted effector that has been convergently acquired by Regiella strains from pea aphids. Notably, only pRILSR1-bearing strains confer protection against the specialist fungal pathogen Pandora neoaphidis, indicating that gains and losses of the plasmid underlie the evolution of this key defensive phenotype. Using a multi-year field study, we further show that the pRILSR1 plasmid is strongly associated with Regiella found in pea aphid populations adapted to specific host plants, driving variation in symbiont-mediated defense across populations. Together, our results show that mobile genetic elements generate key adaptive traits in microbial symbionts and, in doing so, drive phenotypic divergence among host populations.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Across four datasets with paired spliced and unspliced count layers, we applied non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to spliced-only, unspliced-only, summed, and concatenated representations. Using cross-validation, we estimated the revealable rank k* (largest stable rank achieving near-optimal held-out error). In all datasets, concatenated representations consistently supported higher k* than spliced-only or unspliced-only inputs and typically exceeded the summed representation, indicating that preserving splicing status exposes additional stable latent programs. Minimal overlap between spliced- and unspliced-derived factors corresponded to modality-specific gene set enrichment patterns consistent with complementary steady-state and nascent regulatory activity.

The rare gain-of-function mutation S810L was reported to alter MR pharmacology by converting classical steroidal antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone into agonists. In contrast, the non-steroidal antagonist finerenone has been shown to retain its functionality. However, the mechanistic reason for those ligand-specific effects remains elusive. To uncover the molecular basis for this ligand-specific behavior, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type and S810L MR bound to eplerenone or finerenone. We combined distance metrics with a residue-centered dynophore analysis and MDPath to track allosteric communication pathways and time-resolved side-chain interactions. In S810L, eplerenone shifts AF-2 side-chain networks toward H12, consistent with an agonist-like topology. Finerenone, by contrast, induces a local H3-H5 compaction around M777-810 yet diverts the AF-2 network away from H12, thereby preserving an antagonist-like topology. These network reallocations are absent in wild-type simulations, indicating a mutation-specific ligand-depending divergence.

Pyricularia oryzae). This study aimed to evaluate the productive performance and reaction to blast of commercial cultivars and advanced lines of annual ryegrass in two edaphoclimatic environments in Santa Catarina, Brazil: Lages (Cfb climate) and Agronomica (Cfa climate). The experiment utilized a randomized block design with eight genotypes and four replicates. Variables analyzed included dry matter yield and blast severity. A bifactorial analysis of variance (genotype by local) and Spearman correlation were performed. The results revealed a significant genotype by environment interaction for both dry matter yield and blast severity, indicating a dependence on local conditions. Blast pressure was drastically higher in Agronomica, which is climatically more favorable to the disease. Annual ryegrass genotypes 'Altovale' and 'Taio' were superior, combining high and stable productivity with low disease severity in both locations. Conversely, the cultivar 'Ponteio' showed high yield only in Lages, suffering a severe reduction and higher susceptibility in Agronomica. 'Ceronte' was the most susceptible genotype, reaching 86.25% severity in Agronomica. The Spearman correlation confirmed a negative and significant impact of blast on forage productivity, with a stronger correlation in Agronomica (-0.689) than in Lages (-0.497). These findings underscore that the GxA interaction is primarily driven by the differential resistance response to blast. 'Altovale' and 'Taio' are the most recommended options. It is concluded that the selection of ryegrass genotypes must be conducted in the target environment, considering blast as a primary selection factor to ensure the stability and sustainability of forage production in southern Brazil.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Likewise, the performance of subjects exposed to THC and then (S)-ketamine worsened on a rotarod. Combined drug treatment led to unusual epinephrine and corticosterone profiles in blood plasma.

The three-dimensional contacts they are able to assay depend strongly on the properties of the enzyme used to fragment chromatin prior to proximity-driven ligation. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase), used in Micro-C, increases resolution at the expense of low ligation efficiency and the need for extensive enzyme titration. To overcome these limitations, we engineered a highly active, TEV protease-activatable caspase-activated DNase (CAD) to enable an efficient, low-sequence-bias, and high-resolution proximity ligation assay we call CAD-C. CAD-C was successful on the first attempt for each human cell line tested and the resulting datasets capture loops, TADs, compartments, and stripes similarly to Micro-C. However, compared to Micro-C and Hi-C, CAD-C shows enhanced sensitivity for promoter-enhancer loops. Leveraging the ligation-competent DNA ends produced by CAD cleavage, we show that CAD-C is compatible with a highly streamlined, repair-free protocol and produces multi-step CADwalks, consecutive ligations between nucleosomal or sub-nucleosomal fragments. With these walks, we probe local chromatin fiber folding contacts, nucleosomal and sub-nucleosomal footprints, and long-range nuclear organization regimes in human cell lines.

M.", "abstract": "Background: Perceptual attunement theory predicts that during the first year of life, infants' neural responses to native speech sounds should strengthen while responses to nonnative contrasts diminish. However, few longitudinal studies have directly tested these predictions using within-subject designs. Methods: We recorded auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) from 84 typically developing infants at three time points (3, 6, and 12 months) using an oddball paradigm with native (/ba/-/da/) and nonnative (dental vs. retroflex /a/) consonant contrasts. We examined developmental trajectories of the mismatch response (MMR) and obligatory components (P1, N1, P2) using linear mixed-effects models, with Session x Language interactions testing differential development for native versus nonnative contrasts. Center of mass analysis characterized spatial reorganization of ERP topography across development. Results: Contrary to perceptual attunement predictions, most ERP measures showed similar developmental trajectories for native and nonnative consonants. Of 14 interaction tests, only N1 latency for deviant waveforms showed a significant Session x Language interaction (p = 0.046, p2 = 0.025). Significant main effects of Session on multiple measures confirmed ongoing auditory maturation. Center of mass analysis revealed systematic spatial reorganization: P1 showed posterior migration and leftward shifts (0.078 units displacement), while N1 and MMR exhibited anterior shifts, with nonnative consonants showing larger spatial reorganization for N1 (0.099 units vs.0.058 units for native). Conclusions: Robust neural signatures of perceptual attunement for consonants may be more subtle, later-emerging, or stimulus-specific than commonly assumed. The dissociation between stable amplitude and migrating generators suggests that spatial location may be as important as response magnitude for characterizing auditory maturation during early infancy. Practically, equivalent neural responses to native and nonnative consonant contrasts should not be interpreted as evidence of atypical development; rather, indices of general auditory maturation may be more reliable markers of healthy development during the first year.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

We used quantal-resolution imaging to measure synchronous and asynchronous glutamate release at individual cortical boutons in wild type and Syt7-/- neurons. Stratifying boutons by release efficacy and applying failure-based analysis to isolate trials where the first action potential evoked no release allowed us to separate facilitation from vesicle depletion. Syt7 deletion selectively eliminated activity-dependent facilitation of synchronous release but left facilitation of asynchronous release intact, although its overall magnitude was reduced.

Experiment 1 investigates how occluder size, familiarity, and symmetry affect human completions using a drawing task. Narrow occluders and asymmetry promote single-shape completions, while familiarity and (global) symmetry promote two-shape interpretations. Good continuation emerges as the strongest cue, with symmetry and familiarity playing increasingly important roles as occluder width increases. Experiment 2 compares human performance with three state-of-the-art generative AI models. Models often generated creative but non-compliant outputs, altering even unoccluded regions. We restricted analysis to instruction-following generations, identified through ratings by naive observers. Among compliant outputs, models showed some human-like biases (e.g., more two-shape completions for wide occluders), but failed with higher-level cues. They did not use symmetry to guide completions and showed reversed familiarity effects. Our findings highlight differences between human and AI completions. Humans integrate low- and high-level cues, whereas compliant outputs from the AI models rely primarily on low-level pattern continuation.

Here, we investigate the previously uncharacterized gene PA3049, which is upregulated under biofilm conditions, to determine its role in infection, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial tolerance. We show that the small uncharacterised protein PA3049, renamed as Biofilm antibiotic tolerance Regulator (BatR), promotes biofilm establishment and enhances bacterial survival in sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Proteomic analysis revealed that BatR influences the R2/F2 pyocin cluster, which drives explosive cell lysis and extracellular DNA (eDNA) release during biofilm development. We further identify a specific interaction between BatR and PA0486 (SrkA), an uncharacterised Ser/Thr protein kinase. We show that SrkA controls biofilm and pyocyanin production, and lysis-mediated eDNA release through regulation of the R2/F2 pyocin cluster and activation of bacteriophage Pf1. Our findings support a model in which SrkA directly regulates key biofilm-associated phenotypes, while BatR acts as a modulatory partner that tunes SrkA activity under specific conditions. Finally, BatR function was tested in high validity infection models, including the ex vivo pig lung model of cystic fibrosis infection and a synthetic chronic-wound model.

Our aim was to define the mechanical properties of well-characterized in vitro-differentiated vSMC compared to vSMC derived from adult human aorta (AoSMC). Methods and Results: We generated paraxial mesoderm (PM)-derived synthetic and contractile vSMC from hPSC lines, and we obtained proliferating AoSMC. Immature, synthetic hPSC-vSMC are proliferative, sensitive to contact inhibition and exhibit phenotype switching. Contractile hPSC-vSMCs are non-proliferative, have elevated levels of contractile proteins, and can undergo phenotype switching in vitro into a proliferative form. Immunostaining of contractile proteins present in vSMCs (CNN1, MYH11, TAGLN, ACTA2) display similar cell-to-cell heterogeneities between AoSMC and hPSC-vSMCs. The fluorescent signals are relatively uniform at sub-confluency, but highly variable at confluency. Human PSC-vSMC maintain doubling rates more readily and are more easily enriched using lactate medium than AoSMC. The single cell mechanics of AoSMC and hPSC-vSMC, assessed using micropost array detectors (mPADs), are highly comparable and have an average force production per micropost in the nN range. When cultivated to form humanized smooth muscle cell microtissues (SMTs), developed forces normalized to cell numbers are similar to that seen using microarray post detectors. Maximum developed forces in these tissues could be measured in response to endothelin-1. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that synthetic hPSC-vSMCs and proliferating AoSMCs are highly comparable, and mechanically similar, but results with hPSC-vSMC are more reproducible.

A.; Pedraja, F.; Migliaro, A.", "abstract": "Animals actively explore their surroundings to efficiently obtain resources, relying on the sensory modalities available to them. In South American weakly electric fish, self-generated electric organ discharges (EODs) create a short-range sensory bubble that, together with locomotion, supports exploration. This behavior relies on the coordinated modulation of spatial movement and electromotor activity, reflected in changes in EOD rate (EODr). However, how these components are engaged in natural contexts, and which conditions are sufficient to elicit exploration, remain poorly understood. Here, we examined how environmental and contextual factors modulate exploratory behavior in Gymnotus omarorum by combining a minimalistic laboratory assay with multi-day recordings in a seminatural arena. In laboratory tanks, freely moving fish showed minimal locomotor activity, which increased only when darkness and a novel electrosensory stimulus co-occurred, indicating strong context dependence and gating by chronobiological and motivational factors. By contrast, under seminatural conditions preserving natural light and temperature cycles, fish exhibited robust nocturnal rhythms in both locomotor activity and EODr. Chronobiological analysis revealed that the electrosensory rhythm consistently preceded the locomotor rhythm, with individual phase differences correlated across behaviors. These results show that exploration is a temporally organized behavior arising from coordinated modulation of sensory and motor systems.

A set of model bacterial samples was prepared from E. coli and H. bluephagenesis sp. TD01 in 1:2 and 2:1 ratios and analysed using five LC-MS systems. Data from the timsTOF HT, Exploris 480, ZenoTOF 7600 and Select Series MRT were processed through DIANN and MSStats. Data from the Vion was processed through Skyline then MSstats. Of the 8,222 proteins identified across all samples analysed (4,401 proteins from E. coli; 3,821 from Halomonas sp.

K.; Lim, J.-H.; Ulery, B.", "abstract": "Background context: Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the most common osteoporotic fracture, yet current vertebral augmentation (VA) approaches rely exclusively on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), a non-resorbable cement that is associated with significant clinical drawbacks. Preclinical models are essential for evaluating novel injectable, bioactive alternatives, but existing small- and large-animal systems have translational limitations. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a reproducible osteoporotic rabbit model that integrates controlled osteoporosis induction with a surgically accessible, fluoroscopically guided VA procedure suitable for preclinical evaluation of novel injectable biomaterials. Study design: This study employed a basic science, preclinical method-development approach using an adult female New Zealand White rabbit model of osteoporosis combined with lumbar VA. Methods: Adult female New Zealand White rabbits underwent bilateral ovariectomy followed by glucocorticoid treatment to establish osteoporosis as confirmed by qCT-derived reductions in bone mineral density and T-scores [&le;] -2.5. A novel open dorsal surgical approach was optimized ex vivo and applied in vivo to access the lumbar vertebrae (L4 - L5) for bilateral cortical decortication and PMMA injection. Structural changes were assessed by quantitative CT before and after VA. Results: The induction protocol produced consistent, reversible, and re-inducible osteoporotic phenotypes, with significant reductions in trabecular and cortical density as well as thinning of cortical microarchitecture. The surgical workflow achieved reproducible, fluoroscopically-confirmed cement delivery into the vertebral cancellous compartment while minimizing leakage. Post-VA imaging demonstrated stable trabecular and cortical parameters, with expected reductions in bone surface metrics attributable to surgical access and cement filling. Conclusion: This study establishes the technical feasibility and reproducibility of a combined osteoporotic and VA rabbit model that integrates disease-relevant bone degeneration with a clinically aligned surgical workflow. Clinical significance: This model bridges a critical translational gap between rodent and large-animal systems and provides a robust preclinical platform for evaluating next-generation injectable, bioactive, and biodegradable materials aimed at improving safety and regenerative outcomes in osteoporotic VCF repair.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Conventional analysis methods to identify cell-types and states in imSRT data rely on gene count matrices derived from tallying the number of mRNA molecules detected for each gene per segmented cell, thereby overlooking subcellular heterogeneity that can be useful in defining cell states. Results To take advantage of the molecular-resolution information in imSRT data and potentially identify cell-states based on subcellular heterogeneity, we developed STARIT (Spatial Transcriptomics As Rasterized Image Tensors). STARIT converts transcripts within segmented cells in imSRT data into an image-based tensor representation that can be combined with deep learning computer vision models for downstream analysis. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that STARIT distinguishes transcriptionally distinct cell-types and further separates cell states based on subcellular transcript localization, which conventional gene count analysis fails to capture. Likewise, using real imSRT data, we demonstrate how STARIT identifies comparable cell-types to conventional gene count analysis as well as delineate rotational variation. By providing a standardized framework to encode subcellular molecular information in imSRT data, STARIT will enable deeper insights into subcellular heterogeneity and enhance the identification and characterization of cell-types and states that are overlooked by gene count representations.

Its roots are believed to impart comprehensive health benefits supporting lifespan and healthspan through its anti-stress, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective activity. Scientific validation of its claimed biological effects is warranted. Methods: The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans was challenged with heat or certain neurotoxic/mitotoxic chemical stressors, and worm activity (healthspan) was compared between W. somnifera root extract (WSRE)-exposed and control worm populations, through an automated worm tracker. Results: Previous exposure of worms to WSRE conferred prophylactic benefit on them in face of subsequent challenge with rotenone, MnCl2, or levamisole. Worms pre-exposed to either of these toxins were able to recover faster in presence of WSRE. This extract was also able to reduce the susceptibility of wild type worms to heat-induced paralysis, and that of transgenic worms to beta-amyloid mediated paralysis. Conclusions: Adaptogenic potential of W. somnifera roots was demonstrated in worm model. WSRE can be said to possess a wide anti-stress spectrum as it protected the worms against different stressors inducing toxicity through different mechanisms including interference with acetylcholine and dopamine neurons and function.

In this study, the qualitative influence of commonly used extraction methods on the phytochemical composition of aromatic medicinal herbs was investigated using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Ten aromatic medicinal herbs belonging to the families Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, and Asteraceae were subjected to six extraction approaches: simple distillation, essential oil (essence) extraction, hydroalcoholic tincture, infusion, decoction, and decoction of distillate. All extracts were analyzed under standardized HPTLC conditions using silica gel 60 F254 plates, a toluene-ethyl acetate-acetic acid (8:2:0.3, v/v) mobile phase, anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid derivatization, and a standard as a reference compound. Across all investigated species, the extraction method exerted a stronger influence on band number, intensity, and polarity distribution than botanical differences among the herbs. Essential oil and tincture extracts consistently produced the highest diversity of bands, particularly in higher Rf regions corresponding to non-polar and semi-polar compounds. Aqueous methods, including infusion and decoction, predominantly yielded low-Rf polar bands with reduced overall diversity, while simple distillation showed minimal extraction efficiency. These findings demonstrate that extraction strategy is the primary factor governing qualitative phytochemical outcomes in HPTLC-based herbal analysis. The results highlight the importance of method selection in phytochemical screening and provide a comparative framework for choosing appropriate extraction techniques in pharmacological, cosmetic, and analytical applications.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscle tissue is comprised of many individual muscle cells (myofibers) that can be classified as different types based on their morphology, histochemistry, enzymatic reactivity, and biochemical characteristics. One of the most common methods of classification of muscle fiber type relies on the local expression of specific myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. Adult mammalian muscle fibers are generally categorized into four major types including I, IIA, IIX, and IIB. However, the distribution of these muscle fiber types varies across both different species and muscle groups within species, influencing muscle function and physiological responses. In bovine species, skeletal muscle plays a critical role in determining in-vivo metabolic physiological processes and impacting post-harvest meat quality traits. Immunostaining methods using isoform-specific MyHC antibodies have been widely adopted to characterize muscle fiber morphology. However, manual capture and analysis of immunofluorescent images of muscle fiber type staining is time consuming, labor-intensive, and potentially susceptible to investigator bias. To address these limitations, we established and validated a high-throughput method for the analysis of bovine muscle fiber morphology that combines automated fluorescent microscopy with high-content image analysis using a customized version of the MuscleJ plugin for FIJI/ImageJ that we named MuscleBos. This refined method enables rapid quantitative characterization of muscle fiber type profile and fiber type-specific myofiber cross-sectional area in bovine skeletal muscle tissue cross-sections. This methodology should enable valuable deeper insights into future studies of muscle composition in bovine species and its impact on in vivo animal physiology and meat science.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Studies on this topic have primarily utilized non-athlete participants, with data subsequently extrapolated to athlete populations. Since there may be hesitancy to have athletes involved in research on the interference effects of aerobic exercise on strength specific adaptations, we built a model to simulate these effects and develop an equation to predict interference. The hypothesis tested in this project was that aerobic exercise is the main driver of interference on weightlifting-associated RFD, and that this interference can be modeled to generate an equation to predict changes in RFD. Python software was used to generate the model, perform the simulation and optimize variables that contribute to the interference effect. A nonlinear exponential interference model was created that simulates the changes in RFD from a force-time curve in response to acute aerobic exercise lasting from 2-minutes to 60-minutes in duration. RFD sensitivity to aerobic exercise was modeled such that values were reduced by approximately 70% after aerobic exercise less than 10 minutes, with further reduction to 80% with durations greater than 10-minutes. The prediction equation can be used by strength coaches to predict the interference of acute aerobic exercise on RFD and subsequently allow the coach to make informed decisions on training program design if there is a need to include aerobic exercise in a strength and/or power-based periodized plan.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

However, evidence suggests this measure may also reflect gait complexity and automaticity. This systematic review evaluated examined empirical support for reinterpreting long-term DE as a complexity measure. Methods We systematically searched Web of Science databases through August 2024 for studies applying Rosenstein's algorithm to human gait. We systematically extracted experimental conditions, and participant characteristics from each study. Study quality was assessed using a framework evaluating analytical rigor, outcome reporting, and sample size adequacy. We conducted a meta-analysis examining correlations between long-term DEs and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) scaling exponents, and synthesized evidence from perturbation (environmental disturbances), cueing (external rhythmic stimuli), and between-subject (clinical vs control) studies. Results Fifty-six studies published between 2000 and 2024 met inclusion criteria, with 43% achieving high overall quality scores. Meta-analysis from six datasets (209 participants) revealed a positive correlation between long-term DE and DFA scaling exponents (r=0.64, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.82; I{superscript 2}=82%). Perturbation studies consistently showed and increased short-term DE (lower local stability) while simultaneously decreasing long-term DE by up to 64%. External auditory and visual cueing interventions induced long-term DE decreases (up to -86%) while minimally affecting short-term DEs. Between-subject comparisons revealed heterogeneous patterns, with clinical populations exhibiting both increases and decreases in long-term DE depending on pathology. Conclusions Converging meta-analytic and experimental evidence supports reinterpreting long-term DE as the Attractor Complexity Index--a measure of gait complexity and automaticity rather than stability. Reduced long-term DE during controlled gait conditions reflects suppression of low-frequency variations in gait variability, which constrains phase space exploration and accelerates divergence curve saturation. The measure's sensitivity to prefrontal cortex engagement and attentional demands reveals that long-term DE captures the degree of gait automaticity, with lower values indicating a shift from automatic subcortical control to executive function-mediated regulation. This attention-dependent control reorganization explains patterns observed in aging, clinical populations, and experimental perturbations. This paradigm shift establishes long-term DE as a complementary biomarker for motor-cognitive aspects of gait control, with implications for fall risk assessment, disease monitoring, and rehabilitation evaluation.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

We investigated the synergetic effects of psilocybin and compassion imagery with self-reported questionnaires and functional resonance imaging data (fMRI) in a sample of 105 participants. Participants were primed with either attention to breathing or a short compassion focused imagery prime. We found a long-term synergetic effect of compassion imagery and psilocybin on cognitive absorption, as well as changes relative to baseline self-compassion and decentering. Based on functional interactions between attentional, executive and default mode networks, fMRI-based classifiers detected participant engagement in compassion focused imagery before psilocybin intake and distinguished compassion imagery vs. attention to breathing priming only the high dose of psilocybin. Our results support the potential for synergistic effects from combinations of psilocybin and compassion-based interventions to induce long-term psychological changes, reshaping the functional organization of large-scale brain networks.

A.; Lin, A.; Dennis, E.; Brown, A.; Hamilton, R.; Giza, C.; Choe, M.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We investigated longitudinal trajectories of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), autonomic function, and symptoms after sport-related concussion (SRC). BACKGROUND: Limbic circuitry may be particularly vulnerable to traumatic brain injury (TBI), which could explain the affective and autonomic dysfunction some patients develop. Relatively few studies have performed longitudinal rsfMRI analyses in concussion and fewer have combined imaging with autonomic and symptom data. We leveraged published limbic rsfMRI networks centered on the amygdala that include central autonomic structures in frontal and temporal lobes and their visceromotor targets. We hypothesized that frontoamygdala connectivity would differentiate athletes with SRC from matched, in-sport controls (ISC), predict autonomic function, and predict symptom recovery. DESIGN/METHODS: Using independent-samples t-tests, we compared rsfMRI connectivity strength in amygdala networks in college athletes with SRC (SRC: n=31, female=14) at three time points after concussion (T1[&le;]4 days, T2=10-14 days, T3=60-90 days) and healthy, matched controls without a concussion in the same sport (ISC: n=36, female=17). RESULTS: SRC athletes showed significantly greater frontoamygdala connectivity compared to ISCs at the acute and subacute post-injury time points (T1 p=0.003, T2 p=0.014) that normalized to control-level connectivity by the chronic time point (T3 p=0.182). When testing whether autonomic function interacts with network connectivity trajectory, we found that opposing trajectories of frontoamygdala connectivity between SRC athletes with higher versus lower acute heart rate variability (HRV), as measured by pNN50 (percentage of intervals between successive normal sinus beats greater than 50ms). SRC athletes with higher HRV acutely post-injury had significantly greater acute frontoamygdala connectivity compared to ISCs at T1; connectivity in these high-HRV SRC athletes normalized to control level over time (T1 p=0.001, T2 p=0.055, T3 p=0.576). SRC athletes with lower HRV acutely post-injury had control-level frontoamygdala connectivity at T1; connectivity in these low-HRV SRC athletes significantly exceeded control-level connectivity at T3 (T1 p=0.429, T2 p=0.050, T3 p=0.002). Furthermore, those SRC athletes with the greatest frontoamygdala connectivity at T3, had the most persistent symptoms on the graded symptom checklist at T3 (r=0.635, p=0.001). Differences in diffusion-tensor-imaging-based measures of structural connectivity in the uncinate fasciculus, the fiber bundle most critical to our frontoamygdala network, could not account for these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that increased connectivity in amygdala circuitry acutely after a concussion and its normalization over time may be protective or compensatory; acute measures of amygdala network connectivity and measures of HRV may be valuable biomarkers for predicting symptom persistence.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

P.; Godin, B.; Villapol, S.", "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of chronic neurological disability, yet no disease-modifying therapy exists. Emerging evidence indicates that TBI activates cellular aging programs, including telomere erosion and persistent inflammation, that contribute to progressive neurodegeneration. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) preserves telomere homeostasis and provides cytoprotective effects in the central nervous system, but has not been therapeutically targeted after TBI. Here, we developed an mRNA nanotherapy consisting of mouse TERT mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mTERT-LNPs) and evaluated it in a controlled cortical impact model of moderate TBI. We first established that TBI transiently disrupts TERT biology, with reduced cortical TERT mRNA and shortened telomeres at 3 days post-injury (dpi), followed by partial recovery by 14 dpi. mTERT-LNPs were well tolerated in vitro and in vivo. Following intravenous delivery in the acute post-injury window, LNPs localized to the injured brain and displayed expected peripheral biodistribution. A single systemic dose increased cortical TERT mRNA and protein and partially restored telomere length at 3 dpi. TERT mRNA delivery significantly reduced Iba1+ microglial activation and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, with modest increases in anti-inflammatory markers. Systemically, mTERT-LNPs lowered serum C-reactive protein and malondialdehyde, indicating reduced peripheral inflammation and oxidative stress, without adverse effects on body weight or peripheral organ histology. Several outcomes showed sex-dependent patterns. Collectively, these data provide the first in vivo evidence that telomerase therapy can modulate telomere biology and neuroinflammation after TBI, supporting mRNA-LNP-mediated TERT restoration as a scalable, mechanistically grounded strategy for disease modification in TBI and related disorders.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Our RNA-seq analyses of colonic eosinophils isolated from dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice revealed a significant upregulation of cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 (gene name, Ptgs2). Eosinophil-specific deletion of Cox-2 (Ptgs2fl/fleoCre+/-) reduced IL-22 production and exacerbated DSS- and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, characterized by greater weight loss, higher disease activity, colon shortening, and epithelial injury.

The papillae of most tunicate larvae are the key sensory-adhesive organ regulating their settlement and metamorphosis. The papillae are nearly always arranged as a group of three morphologically identical organs that arise from an anterior neural plate border region nested between ventral epidermis and more dorsal/posterior neural tube progenitors. Due to their embryonic origin and molecular signatures, this anterior border has been evolutionarily linked to vertebrate placode regions. It was previously shown that the specification, patterning, and morphogenesis of the embryonic papilla region all depend on BMP signaling, though downstream mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that the NKX2-3/5/6 ortholog NK4 is a key transcription factor that acts downstream of BMP signaling to pattern the papillae in the Ciona embryo. We present evidence that NK4 is activated by BMP signaling and encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required to restrict the expression of the papilla regulatory gene Foxg to three cell clusters that give rise to the three papillae. Loss of NK4 function results in the formation of a single large papilla. In contrast, overexpression of NK4 represses Foxg, eliminating the papillae. We also show that the expression of NK4 is restricted dorsally by the BMP antagonist Chordin, while the ventrally-expressed transcription factor Msx alleviates the repressive effect of NK4, potentially allowing for the characteristic tripartite patterning of the papillae.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Resistance displayed moderate heritability and a predominantly polygenic basis, with strong phenotypic divergence among morphotypes: B. oleracea var. capitata was generally susceptible, whereas var. botrytis and wild populations showed markedly higher resistance. Despite this polygenic background, a major-effect QTL on chromosome C01 was identified, showing a strong enrichment of resistance alleles in wild populations and susceptible alleles in var. capitata. Genome-wide F-statistics and heterozygosity scans revealed a recent selective sweep at this locus on the wild lineages. Considering current evidence for the feral origin of contemporary \"wild\" populations, these results suggest that part of the resistance observed today evolved after domestication and subsequent feralization, independently of resistance in var. botrytis. This paraphyletic distribution underlines the importance of integrating demographic history into quantitative genetic analyses in domesticated plant systems.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Beyond this specific study, GIGEM is broadly suited for diverse Drosophila sleep research involving large-scale and multi-batch datasets. GIGEM enabled an extensive analysis of sleep parameters and allowed systematic identification of sleep changes in response to social isolation. Following acute social isolation, SIP line animals showed heterogeneous responses, including sleep loss, sleep gain, and no change in sleep. In contrast, chronic social isolation led to significant sleep loss in nearly all lines, though to varying degrees. While most SIP lines were sensitive to chronic social isolation, a select few were resistant to it. These results were obtained across 38 SIP lines and wild-type controls (totaling 5670 animals).

The Anisogel, an anisotropic microgel-in-hydrogel system, involves two key factors for tissue engineering: guidance cues - magnetically aligned rod-shape structures - and a surrounding matrix - polyethylene glycol-vinylsulfone (PEG-VS) with a degradable peptide crosslinker. This research shows the potential of using a PEG-VS- based Anisogel to allow for guided ingrowth and chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) modulated by the alignment and size of anisometric microgels. The properties of the surrounding matrix are optimized for the availability of anchoring peptides (RGD concentration) and matrix density (PEG-VS concentration). The microgels of highest tested dimensions (10x10x100 {micro}m3) lead to a donor-independent significant upregulation of chondrogenic markers (SOX 9, ACAN and COL2AI) and a decrease of hypertrophic chondrogenic markers (RUNX 2), compared to unaligned and smaller microgel sizes. As a proof of concept, the Anisogel is tested in a semi-orthotopic mouse model where the effect of microgel alignment on tissue infiltration is evaluated.

L.; Pickering, E.; Subedi, P.; Woodruff, M.; Klein, T.", "abstract": "Bone is a dynamic tissue that experiences a wide range of forces during regular daily locomotion. This environment of dynamic strain strongly influences the architecture of the extracellular matrix, and it can impact the rate that bone adapts or recovers after an injury. Cell research is commonly performed in mechanically static conditions in the base of well plates, yet this is a far cry from the conditions natural to osteoblasts. To better understand the behaviours of osteoblasts, it is important to ensure that platforms are available to perform cell culture experiments in mechanically dynamic environments. For this reason, we have designed a bioreactor system that imparts tensile strain onto flat, cell-seeded scaffold constructs in vivo within custom well plates. The bioreactor system has 36 separated wells spread across four mechanical actuation units and can apply up to 30% tensile strain to a 15 by 9 mm area of the constructs, operating within an incubator. The wider body of mechanostimulation research also shows that different many cell types, from neurons to cardiac tissue and more can be stimulated with a range of stimulus and have a wide array of responses, and it is expected that the bioreactor will also be useful for this research. To be accessible to research groups, the bioreactor has predominantly been constructed from widely available components and materials. Most parts fabricated using 3D printing, and all of the electronics can be found within a typical 3D printer DIY assembly kit. The device was validated for use in a 28 day in-vitro dynamic culture of osteoblasts on melt-electrowritten polycaprolactone scaffolds. The cell constructs were strained to 4% at 0.5 Hz on days 25 - 27 and removed on the 28th day.

Here we adapted a thin-film bridge (TFB) delivery method from vehiculation experiments in acellular models to a lung-on-chip (LoC) platform under breathing-like stretch. Using confocal live-imaging, we demonstrate vehiculation and cellular uptake of fluorescently-labelled cargoes such as Tacrolimus or Beclomethasone. We systematically compared TFB vehiculation to existing in vitro delivery approaches. TFB vehiculation promoted sustained retention of functionally effective Tacrolimus, strong co-localization with surfactant lipids, and accumulation in macrophages in human LoCs reconstituted with in vitro-differentiated alveolar macrophage-like cells. This contrasted with the unphysiological dominant uptake of formulations in liquid by alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, in proof-of-concept experiments, TFB-vehiculated bedaquiline effectively suppressed subsequent growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a prophylactic manner.

Conventional signal-to-noise and LOD/LOQ rules are typically justified under simple, constant-variance (white) noise models and do not control the probability of obtaining at least one spurious peak across a chromatogram, even though structured chemical noise and co-eluting interferences dominate at trace levels. We introduce a wavelet-based Monte Carlo framework for single reaction monitoring (SRM) LC-MS/MS traces that empirically characterizes chemical-noise peaks, builds a generative noise-only null model directly from these observations, and assigns per-time-point p-values with family-wise error control. The need for such objective, statistically grounded criteria has become particularly acute in studies of analytes near the limits of detection (LOD). As a motivating example, we apply our framework to lipid mediator research, illustrating how chemically realistic null models and chromatogram-level error control can alter calls near the LOD while preserving robust detection of established prostaglandin-positive controls. At an adjusted p < 0.05 (controlling the chance of at least one false-positive peak per chromatogram at about 5%), our criteria show strong concordance with the presence or absence of confirmatory product ions in this dataset, suggesting that our empirical noise model captures the main features of chemically structured background peaks.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, a multiscale circulation model was developed by coupling a multiscale systemic hemodynamic framework with cerebral arterial network reconstructed from medical imaging. The model integrates a cerebral autoregulation mechanism (CAM) and enables quantitative simulation of flow redistribution across the CoW under normal, anatomically varied, and pathologically narrowing (stenosis) conditions. Baseline simulations at normal states reproduced physiological flow distributions in which the communicating arteries remained nearly inactive, showing negligible across-flow and agreement with clinical measurements, while two anatomical variations revealed distinct collateral activation patterns: the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) acted as the earliest and most sensitive functional collateral pathway, whereas the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) exhibited structure-dependent engagement. Progressive stenosis modelling further demonstrated the transition from a complete CoW to a fetal-type posterior cerebral artery (PCA) configuration, with early ACoA flow reversal followed by the ipsilateral PCoA activation, in agreement with experimental and transcranial Doppler observations. We further present a path-based quantitative analysis of source-to-sink flow contributions to quantitatively illustrates how the cerebral vascular network dynamically reconfigures collateral pathways in response to structural changes.

The objective of this study is to simulate the mechanical-electrical coevolution of solid cancer using an energetic approach, which involves the local and global changes of bioelectricity in the entire unperturbed tumor, aspects that may be correlated spatially and electrically with the growth, progression, nucleation, angiogenesis and metastasis of a unperturbed solid malignant tumor. For this, spherical harmonics, phase-field, and the Turing approach were taken into account in the model. The results showed that electrical bioptentials and volumentric charge density throughout the interior of the unperturbed tumor, as well as surface charge density at tumor-surrounding healthy tissue boundary during its growth depended on mass aggregation, time and type of spherical harmonics. Regions with both positive and negative charge densities throughout the interior of the unperturbed tumor volume were observed. We concluded that positive and negative values may be responsible for maintaining the electronegativity of the entire tumor, primarily within it, during its growth over time. It is concluded that the anomalous bioelectricity and biomechanics in unperturbed cancer are due to intratumoral electrical heterogeneity and anisotropy according to Phi1(r, theta, varphi), rhov(t), sigma12 and Turing spatiotemporal patterns, depending on the degree of Ynm asymmetry, muT value (0.0 < muT < muTth) and t. Anomalous bioelectricity and biomechanics are closely related and both should be considered as another hallmark of cancer because these are essentially involved in self-regulation of symmetry, global electronegativity, intratumoral biological heterogeneity and anisotropy, growth, metastasis (by electrostatic and/or electromagnetic repulsion), abnormal metabolism of unperturbed cancer, as well as its protection from attack by cellular elements of the immune system and anticancer therapies (by formation of a heterogeneous electric shield), and in the appropriate and individualized selection of anticancer therapy, either alone or in combination.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

An adaptable, quantitative animal health assessment system that utilizes simple, non-invasive, visual measurements can allow researchers to use these models to their full potential while safeguarding humane endpoints. The goal of this work was to establish such health scoring systems for translationally-relevant ovarian (ID8 Defb29-Vegf-A) and breast cancer (triple-negative model 4T1) models. We developed a tractable health assessment system by monitoring a combination of activity and responsiveness, coat condition, respiratory function, changes in body weight, posture, gait, tumor size (where measurable), and extent of ulceration, and scoring each of these parameters using a simple numerical scale. The scores at which euthanasia or other interventions were required were estimated and then adjusted based on clinical assessment by a team of researchers and veterinarians. These semi-quantitative health scoring systems were applied to survival experiments, in which mice were euthanized at a predetermined score or upon meeting a superseding health criterion, to confirm their applicability and effectiveness in maintaining humane endpoints.

Using a highly sensitive, error-corrected sequencing method, we demonstrate that human population-relevant doses of BPA cause mutations that are consistent with oxidative DNA damage; however, overall mutation frequency does not differ substantially from controls.

Microglia rapidly express IL-1 after cerebral ischemia, whereas IL-1{beta} expression is delayed and restricted to a small subset of microglia and infiltrating immune cells. Here, we investigated for the first time the specific contribution of microglial-derived IL-1{beta} to acute injury and post-stroke neurorepair after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in male and female mice, through microglial-specific tamoxifen-inducible Cre-loxP-mediated recombination. Deletion of microglial IL-1{beta} improved acute neurological outcome, reduced neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic brain and dampened systemic inflammatory cytokines.

Recent studies have shown that the 1/f slope is sensitive to stimulus onset, characterized by initial inhibitory shifts followed by excitatory rebounds, which may reflect cognitive control mechanisms involved in suppressing distractions and preparing goal-directed responses. However, previous works have relied on fixed temporal windows and insufficient control of ERP contamination, limiting our understanding of rapid control dynamics.

Forty-nine participants categorized pictures while ignoring congruent or incongruent words. Behaviorally, we replicated robust CE and CSE patterns. Spectral slope analyses showed that incongruent trials elicited steeper slopes - consistent with increased inhibition - particularly in frontal and central regions, reflecting conflict-related control engagement. Moreover, CSE analyses revealed dynamic slope modulations across frontal, central, and occipital components over time, suggesting control adjustments influenced by previous trial congruency.

Here we examine this hypothesis by introducing a bio-inspired spacing effect into artificial neural networks, integrating input and innate variations across spaced intervals at the neuronal, synaptic, and network levels. These spaced ensemble strategies yield significant performance gains across various benchmark datasets and network architectures. Biological experiments on Drosophila further validate the complementary effect of appropriate variations and spaced intervals in improving generalization, which together reveal a convergent computational principle shared by biological learning and machine learning.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

V.; Zylberberg, C.; Flo, J. M.; Lopez, R. A.; Bridges, A. J.; Jerusalinsky, D. A.; zorzopulos, J.", "abstract": "Cellular homeostasis is crucial for cellular function and is sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, often triggered by protein-folding overload. To maintain balance, cells activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), a network of signaling pathways that enhance stress resistance by increasing chaperone activity, reducing global translation, and promoting the degradation of misfolded proteins via autophagy. Additional cellular stress-response pathways, including the NRF2 antioxidant pathway and the AMPK energy-sensing pathway, work together to reinforce homeostasis. In pathological conditions, restoring immune balance presents a promising therapeutic approach. Among emerging pharmacological agents that modulate endogenous protective pathways, the synthetic immunomodulatory oligonucleotide IMT504 has shown favorable pharmacokinetics and stability in preclinical models, though its precise mechanisms of action remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the cellular, molecular, and transcriptional responses of purified human CD19 B cells to IMT504 treatment to uncover its mechanism of action and potential for promoting immune homeostasis. We found that IMT504 stimulation induces a previously unidentified subpopulation of human B cells, which we termed B homeostatic cells (Bhom). These Bhom cells exhibit a unique phenotype (CD27-CD24CD38CD138-MUC1) and upregulate genes involved in mitochondrial function, proteostasis, antioxidant defense, and cell survival. Promoter analysis of the most highly upregulated genes revealed an Invariant Gene Transcriptional Regulator (IGTR) signature, with binding motifs for MYC, CREB1, CTCF, EP300, and NRF1/NRF2, suggesting coordinated transcriptional control of the associated homeostatic programs. Network analysis identified connections between NRF1 and the SIRT1/PGC1 metabolic axis, and NRF2 with IGTR-regulated factors. Furthermore, we discovered that IMT504 binds to ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), an endogenous repressor of AMPK, indicating that IMT504 may activate AMPK-dependent autophagy and downstream NRF1/NRF2 signaling. These findings identify Bhom cells as a novel subset of B cells with homeostatic features and establish IMT504 as a potent inducer of immune homeostasis through AMPK-driven transcriptional reprogramming. This mechanism strongly supports the potential of IMT504 as a candidate for immune-modulatory therapies aimed at restoring immune balance.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Presently, no vaccine candidate has induced antibody responses capable of meaningful protection against the swathe of circulating, difficult to neutralizing tier 2 HIV-1 viruses. However, the development of stabilized, native-like envelope (Env) trimers such as BG505.SOSIP.664.T332N (BG505 SOSIP) has marked a significant advancement in vaccine design, due to their ability to elicit NAbs that neutralize tier 2 viruses in rhesus macaques (RM). NAb development following envelope trimer immunization in RM remains poorly understood, with hypothesized contributions from genetic variation at the IG loci, naive B cell repertoire, and differential gene expression in B cell lineages. To address these knowledge gaps, we have developed a set of BG505 SOSIP probes capable of recovering paired clonotype identity, antigen specificity, and gene expression of B cells in a high throughput fashion. These probes were constructed by conjugating biotinylated BG505 SOSIP to streptavidin covalently linked to both sc-RNA-Seq compatible DNA oligonucleotides and flow cytometry compatible fluorophores. Using these reagents, we isolated and sequenced BG505 SOSIP specific memory B cells from the PBMCs of an RM that developed high titers of neutralizing antibodies. To benchmark the accuracy of our technology, we compared our recovered heavy and light chain sequences to those identified from the same animal using conventional methodology and recovered 100% of previously identified NAbs. We then applied this technology to recover BG505 SOSIP specific memory B cells from five additional vaccinated RMs, cloned 34 antibodies for functional characterization, and identified ten antibodies with autologous neutralizing activity.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

FLAMOD, a recombinant flagellin, stimulates innate immunity via Toll-like receptor 5 when delivered intranasally. In mice, FLAMOD protects against bacterial pneumonia. The protection is associated with activation of airway epithelial cells. This study aimed to assess the tolerance of human primary respiratory epithelium to FLAMOD administered apically as liquid droplets or by nebulization, to measure the innate immune response, and the pharmacokinetics of FLAMOD. We used epithelia reconstituted from human nasal and bronchial (MucilAir), small airways (SmallAir) and alveolar (AlveolAir) primary epithelial cells, cultured at the air-liquid interface. We report that daily administration of escalating doses of FLAMOD for 5 days was well tolerated by epithelia as barrier integrity, cilia motion and cell viability were not affected. FLAMOD was rapidly degraded without leakage into the basal compartment. Each epithelial model exhibited responses involving pathways of innate defense and immune cell infiltration, which were dose-dependent, with an effective concentration of FLAMOD in the picomolar range. Similar tolerance profile and immune responses were obtained with airway epithelium from cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. In conclusion, this study supports the stimulation of epithelial Toll-like receptor 5 signaling to fight against infections of vulnerable patients.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Global knockout of Cops5 is embryonically lethal, and while it is known to be vital in germ cells and testicular smooth muscle, its function in Sertoli cells, the key somatic supporters of spermatogenesis, remains entirely unknown. This study investigates the critical role of COPS5 within Sertoli cells. Using Sertoli cell-specific Cops5 knockout mouse models, we demonstrate that COPS5 is essential for maintaining male fertility. Sertoli-specific Cops5 ablation resulted in age-dependent male infertility, despite normal initial development. Mutants exhibited progressive testicular atrophy, oligoasthenospermia, and significantly reduced testis weight. Histology showed vacuolated, disorganized tubules devoid of germ cells and sperm. Crucially, COPS5 loss disrupted Sertoli cell polarity, evidenced by aberrant cytoplasmic mislocalization of the nuclear marker WT1 and detachment from the basement membrane. Integrity of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) was severely compromised, with discontinuous and punctate expression of the tight junction adaptor ZO-1. Intercellular communication was also impaired, shown by a stark reduction in Connexin 43 gap junction signals. Our findings establish that COPS5 is an indispensable intrinsic regulator of Sertoli cell function. Its loss disrupts cell polarity, BTB architecture, and gap junction communication, leading to failed support of spermatogenesis and consequently infertility. This work defines a novel and critical somatic function for COPS5 in male reproduction. We conclude that COPS5 is intrinsically required in Sertoli cells to maintain their polarity and BTB function, which are foundational for supporting germ cell development and ensuring male fertility. This identifies COPS5 as a novel, essential regulator within the testicular somatic compartment.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Vector control has been recognized as an essential tool to fight against these diseases. Nevertheless, it requires the best possible knowledge of the biology of the targeted population. Population genetics tools can prove very useful to obtain such information but require the use of polymorphic and reliable genetic markers. In this paper we present the development of microsatellite markers using a new high-throughput sequencing based technology (SSRseq). We applied it on two species of tsetse flies from three HAT foci and obtained more accurate results as compared to microsatellite loci developed with classic methods. We could indeed use 9 to 14 SSRseq loci without the several problems generally met with classic microsatellites, as all were located in autosomes, without short allele dominance or stuttering and very few null alleles. SSRseq loci appeared much more polymorphic in tsetse flies as compared to other species (fungi, trees, bees, or fishes), which suggested much higher effective population sizes, much higher mutation rates of the genome or both, suggesting high capacities for evolutionary adaptation. With the 9-14 loci kept, we confirmed the propensity of these flies to move almost freely in the whole zones investigated, and also highlighted the possible evolutionary response of one of the unkept loci regarding vector control devices used in these HAT foci, which will require further studies. We suggest for further population structure studies to use only loci with less than 1% missing data, which proved being a good and fast selection strategy to get the most reliable results.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

While mammary differentiation has been extensively studied, how mammary gene expression relates to that of other epithelial secretory organs remains incompletely defined. Here, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of human mammary tissue in the context of multiple epithelial secretory and non-glandular tissues using GTEx bulk RNA-seq data. By integrating cross-tissue differential expression analysis with single-cell expression references, co-expression network analysis, and evolutionary comparisons, we aimed to distinguish transcriptional programs that are shared across glandular epithelia from those that are specific to the mammary gland. Our analyses identify three major classes of gene expression programs: glandular-enriched programs shared among epithelial secretory organs, mammary-specific programs associated with metabolic and hormone-responsive functions, and female-biased programs largely linked to immune-related processes. Comparative evolutionary analyses further suggest that mammary specialization predominantly reflects regulatory redeployment of conserved gene modules rather than the emergence of mammalian-specific genes. Together, these findings place mammary gene expression within a broader framework of epithelial secretory biology and support a model in which mammary-specific functions arise through selective reweighting and organization of conserved transcriptional programs. This comparative perspective provides insight into the molecular basis of mammary differentiation and the evolutionary logic underlying specialization of epithelial secretory organs.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

HttEx1 forms one of the lowest complexity amyloid cores known, its fibril core consists of a single amino acid, glutamine. With emerging therapies improving patients prospects by silencing expression of HTT, tools to monitor HttEx1 aggregation become essential for timely intervention and next generation therapeutics. Here, we show that the peptide FibrilPaint1 selectively binds HttEx1Q44 fibrils without interacting with monomeric protein, allowing to measure and trace HttEx1 amyloid fibrils. Using the FibrilRuler assay, we tracked fibril formation from early species to larger clustered assemblies. The non-fluorescent variant, FibrilPaint20, was used to recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP to HttEx1 fibrils, enabling site-specific ubiquitin tagging. However, unlike Tau fibrils, ubiquitinated HttEx1 fibrils resisted proteasomal degradation. This reveals a fundamental difference in how amyloids with extremely low complexity cores respond to cellular clearance machinery.

In parallel, computational methods have evolved to integrate diverse omics with increasing precision in resolving cellular heterogeneity and delineating subtle subpopulation structures. Yet, capturing rare cell population while maintaining computational tractability remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce the supercell paradigm, in which expression-coherent cells are compressed into candidate units for rare cell population. Supercells are constructed using angle-aware similarity metrics and second-order co-occurrence neighbors, with impurity cells pruned by degree centrality. To address scalability, we implement sparse matrix optimization and iterative high-order graph updates, enabling efficient integration of large-scale multi-omics datasets. Building on this framework, we develop scHG, a high-order graph learning approach guided by an omics-weighted optimizer that adaptively balances contributions from gene expression, surface proteins, and chromatin accessibility. Across six benchmark datasets (up to 30672 cells), scHG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving mean ARI and NMI by 3.97% and 3.54%, respectively, while reducing runtime by 26.40%. Beyond performance gains, scHG was able to resolve fine-grained cellular heterogeneity within conventionally defined T cell populations, distinguishing subpopulations such as memory-like or progenitor-exhausted T cells and innate-like cytotoxic T cells. At the same time, the supercell framework uncovered rare populations, including dendritic-cell populations and NK-like B cells, that remained masked at the cluster level under standard pipelines.

Comparison of structurally related domains are studied to some extent, while the impact of domain combinations is poorly studied. In this study, several types of pairs of domains, arising from different multi-domain proteins were compared to understand the effect of cognate domain on the structural architecture of remote homologues. Several network parameters were compared among these domains. We found that an interacting domain of unrelated structure exerts higher structural and evolutionary pressure on the remote homologues, leading to structural embellishments and functional modifications. This exerted change is mediated by local rearrangements of the amino acid residues in the structure. Case studies were conducted to understand these effects.

This process is costly, does not scale well, depends on expert pathologists, and may ignore relevant tumor microenvironment features or reflect subjective labelling decisions. Here, we present an annotation-free, weakly supervised pipeline and web-based tool for breast cancer molecular subtyping using a computational pathology foundation model.

Tile-level embeddings were extracted with a foundation model, and slide-level representations were obtained by mean pooling. We evaluated one-vs-rest classifiers including cosine similarity, logistic regression, and attention-based multiple instance learning.

One way to address these issues is to build a mapping from the chemical space to a continuous latent embedding space where efficient exploration and smooth interpolations become possible. Existing methods suffer from several limitations: failure to accurately reconstruct molecules, poorly structured latent space where whole regions cannot be decoded to valid molecular graphs or where distances fail to reflect chemical similarities, not to mention the unavailability of ready-to-use code or models trained on sufficiently large datasets, limiting their practical application. In this work, we provide a large-scale pre-trained Variational Autoencoder based on the Transformer architecture to convert small organic molecules to continuous fixed-size embeddings in a chemistry-aware structured latent space and back. With a 97% reconstruction rate and a 100% validity rate, the model provides a reliable mapping and is able to generate a high diversity of novel molecules.

Even when such shock wave exposure results in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) without abnormalities on routine imaging, persistent neurological symptoms may occur. Yet, the biological processes that link an acute blast wave insult to progressive neuronal dysfunction remain poorly defined. Methods: We established Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes as a genetically accessible animal model for blast-related mTBI (br-mTBI). Animals were exposed in gelatin to shock waves generated by a custom-built shock wave generator (SWG), which produces explosive shock waves with an abrupt overpressure peak followed by a negative pressure phase. The resulting pressure-time curves are very similar to the profiles of conventional explosives in free-field setups. To enable mechanistic studies under controlled laboratory conditions, we developed a complementary platform using a medical radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) device. Motor behavior, mechanosensory function, neuronal morphology and cytoskeletal integrity were analyzed during aging. Results: SWG-derived shock waves induced immediate but reversible motor and sensory deficits, followed by an accelerated age-dependent decline in movement and touch sensitivity. The rESWT platform accurately reproduced these phenotypes. Touch receptor neurons showed progressive structural abnormalities, including degeneration, alongside acute PTL-1/Tau mislocalization consistent with cytoskeletal injury. Conclusions: Defined shock wave exposure is sufficient to provoke long-term neuronal functional decline in C. elegans, accompanied by structural deterioration and premature neurodegeneration.

In everyday vision, however, observers naturally move their heads and manipulate objects with their hands to obtain informative cues, thus raising the question of how such exploratory actions contribute to material recognition. We used immersive virtual reality to examine whether viewpoint changes and object manipulations support the discrimination of visually challenging materials, specifically metal versus glass, whose appearances depend strongly on the associated illumination and viewing geometry. On the basis of three experiments, we revealed that observers systematically increased their exploration tendencies when the identity of a material was ambiguous and that this increased movement was associated with higher discrimination accuracy. By independently manipulating head- and hand-based motions, we identified the context-dependent contributions of each modality, revealing that viewpoint changes dominated when multiple objects could be compared simultaneously, whereas object manipulation was more effective when only a single target was available. Moreover, the participants differed in terms of the efficiency of their sampling strategies, and those who employed more informative exploration patterns exhibited both higher accuracy and greater performance gains across different trials.

O.", "abstract": "Host-pathogen interactions can result in stochastic variation in infection outcomes, where the host survives the infection with a persistent bacterial load, clears the infection, or succumbs to death with a high pathogen load. This inter-individual variation is thought to be driven by the speed of immune activation, pathogen virulence and the ability of the pathogen to survive inside the host, but not much is known about whether inter-individual variation in infection outcome could stem from other factors, such as within-host spatial dynamics of the pathogen during infection. Hence, in this study, we used the pathogenic bacterium Providencia burhodogranariea to investigate the effect of body part and site of injection on infection outcomes in Drosophila melanogaster. Although P. burhodogranariea disseminated throughout the body as would be expected for organisms with an open circulatory system, the bacteria localized at lower levels in the abdomen compared to the head and thorax, and they were cleared more quickly in the abdomen. Furthermore, based on our empirical results in combination with a theoretical model, we suggest that terminal infections could be a consequence of damage to the thorax. Our results highlight the role that factors such as injection site and body part can influence the spatial dynamics of the pathogen, which can, in turn, drive the infection outcomes.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

The data used for the study were based on 13 polymorphic SNPs and 17 morphological markers. The segregation ratios were analyzed revealed that five traits (growth habit, growth pattern, leaf shape, plant hairiness and pod hairiness) segregated significantly according to 3:1 mendelian classical ratio for inheritance whilst the remaining 13 showed 9:7 ratios. Genetic linkage mapping was performed by using the software QTLiCIMapping version 4.2. All the markers used were polymorphic. Eleven linkage groups were detected which spanned a total map length of 93.8217 cM at a LOD score of 4. Variation in marker distribution on all the 11 linkage groups was observed. Fourteen markers were distributed on Chromosome 1. In all cases, segregation distortion was observed for all the markers in each of the linkage groups. Segregation distortion in Chromosome 1, Chromosome 5, Chromosome 8 and Chromosome 11 were highly skewed to the wild parental type. This work provides one of the few integrated morphological-SNP linkage maps for cowpea and highlights genomic regions associated with non-Mendelian inheritance.

Antibody-delivered targeted alpha-particle (-particle) radionuclide therapies (TAT) comprise a tumor-agnostic treatment type, due to the unparalleled killing efficacy of, and irradiation precision (4-5 cell lengths) by, -particles, as well as the selectivity in tumor cell targeting by antibody technologies. However, cells not being directly hit by -particles will likely not be killed. METHODS: To address the limited solid tumor penetration by highly specific and strongly binding antibody-radioconjugates, an experimentally informed digital twin, based on transport (diffusion/advection) first principles, was developed to describe an approach where a fraction of the administered (radio)activity is delivered by a separate type of a model -particle antibody-radioconjugate of low(er)/no affinity for the same marker. The latter was chosen because it can irradiate cells residing in the deep regions of solid tumors away from vasculature. RESULTS: The digital twin that was trained and validated on spheroids that were employed as surrogates of the avascular tumor regions, demonstrated that the investigated cocktails of antibody-radioconjugates with controlled affinities exhibited better inhibition of spheroid growth compared to the extent of growth inhibition by the high-affinity antibody-radioconjugate alone, for the same total (incubated) activity concentrations; this prediction was independent of spheroid size and/or level of expression of the targeted markers. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that antibody-delivered TAT (that is already in the clinic) can be augmented by delivering a fraction of the same total activity by low(er) affinity antibody-radioconjugates. This combination of separate antibody-radioconjugates with variable affinities (for the same targeted marker) is a promising approach to possibly even more delay recurrence and further prolong survival of patients with advanced solid tumors.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

While data generation has rapidly matured, the quantitative analysis of spatial structure remains challenging and poorly standardized, particularly across biological length scales. Existing approaches, such as distance-based metrics, neighborhood analyses and graph neural networks, either capture only local interactions or sacrifice interpretability for predictive power. Here we introduce PCF SiM (Pair Correlation Function Sigmoid Modeling), a scalable and interpretable framework that leverages parametric modeling of the pair correlation function to quantify spatial organization in multiplexed imaging data. PCF SiM compresses complex spatial patterns into a small set of biologically meaningful parameters, enabling robust comparisons across cell types, samples and conditions. Applying PCF SiM to diverse public spatial transcriptomics datasets, we demonstrate its ability to detect condition dependent tissue remodeling in a mouse colitis model. We further extend the framework with a coscaling strategy that identifies cell types participating in shared spatial structures. Using newly generated clinical datasets from Hashimoto thyroiditis and uveal melanoma liver metastases, PCF SiM reveals hierarchical organization of autoimmune infiltrates and coordinated spatial interactions between lymphatic endothelial cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Finally, we show that reliable inference of tissue scale architecture requires whole slide imaging, exposing intrinsic limitations of tumor microarray based spatial analyses.

In the Microgravity Associated Genetics (MESSAGE) Science Mission, Turkiye's first human space biology experiment, we performed an integrative analysis of telomere dynamics, transcriptomic remodeling, and microRNA regulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected before launch (L-7day), after suborbital ascent (L+3hrs), and during days 4-10 aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Spaceflight induced a striking early elongation of telomeres, accompanied by transcriptional activation of DNA repair, oxidative stress mitigation, mitochondrial homeostasis, and immune regulatory pathways. Concurrently, microgravity triggered robust suppression of longevity-associated microRNAs, including members of the miR-17-92, miR29, and miR34 families, suggesting coordinated epigenetic reprogramming of genome stability and stress responses. Notably, the adaptor protein gene AP2A1, recently implicated in cellular rejuvenation and mechanotransductive aging processes, emerged as a consistently microgravity-responsive hub, linking cytoskeletal signaling to telomere maintenance and DNA repair networks. Together, these findings reveal that short-duration spaceflight initiates a multi-layered molecular longevity program in human immune cells, characterized by telomere extension, stabilization of genome maintenance pathways, and suppression of aging-associated miRNA regulators. This systems-level view provides foundational insight into how human biology adapts to short-term microgravity exposure and identifies AP2A1-centered networks as promising targets for enhancing astronaut health and performance and ultimately understanding terrestrial aging.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

M.; Karney, M. M. A.; Wing, H. J.", "abstract": "In bacteria, nucleoid-structuring proteins bind and constrain DNA, often leading to transcriptional silencing. In Shigella spp., the histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein H-NS silences many genes on the large virulence plasmid. Upon a shift to human body temperature, VirB, a DNA-binding protein and key transcriptional regulator of the Shigella virulence cascade, is produced. VirB counteracts H-NS-mediated transcriptional silencing and belongs to a fast-evolving clade of the ParB superfamily. Like other ParB proteins, VirB binds the ligand CTP. While CTP is essential for the anti-silencing activity of VirB, the role of CTP in the mechanism of VirB-dependent anti-silencing has yet to be determined. This work shows that VirB does not require CTP for specific engagement of its DNA recognition site, but CTP is necessary for the formation of large VirB-DNA complexes, which likely form when VirB dimers adopt a sliding clamp conformation. Furthermore, CTP-binding mutants do not trigger a loss of negative supercoils from plasmid DNA, a VirB-dependent activity proposed to destabilize H-NS-DNA complexes. Together, our findings provide novel insight into the relationship between VirB, CTP, and DNA and reveal the role of the VirB ligand, CTP, in regulating Shigella virulence.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

VSMCs possess phenotypic plasticity, contributing to subclinical atherosclerosis. The processes of VSMC phenotypic transitions from the contractile to pro-inflammatory phenotypes are well-studied. However, epitranscriptomic changes during this transition and their regulatory role remain unexplored. Methods: Primary human VSMCs were stimulated with TGF-{beta}1 to induce an atheroprotective, contractile state and with IL1-{beta} plus PDGF-BB to induce a pro-inflammatory state. Sequentially treated VSMCs were further stimulated with PDGF-BB to induce oxidative stress. Transcriptome profiling was performed using Illumina bulk RNA sequencing and epitranscriptomic profiling using Oxford Nanopore Technologies direct RNA sequencing. Potential post-transcriptional regulatory effects of RNA modifications were assessed using small RNA sequencing and proteomics. Results: Transcriptomic changes globally reflected atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic treatments, with oxidative stress inducing the largest gene expression changes. Significant differential RNA modifications were detected mainly between atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic VSMCs. Differences in modification predominantly affected uridine within a GUUUU motif, enriched in 3'-UTR and accessible RNA structures. Poly(A) tail lengths of modified transcripts differed between conditions, and transcripts with more modifications showed increased translation efficiency. Highly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) had predicted binding sites overlapping about 5% of differential modification sites. Conclusions: Atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic treatments induce distinct epitranscriptomic landscapes composed of different modification types in diverse sequence contexts, often co-localized in the same transcript. Differences in poly(A) tail lengths and translation efficiency for genes with different RNA modifications suggest that modifications play a post-transcriptional regulatory role. Uridine modifications were most abundant, enriched in 3'-UTRs and accessible structures, hinting at miRNA-based regulation. Many highly expressed miRNAs may have binding affected by RNA modifications. In summary, epitranscriptomics adds a novel regulatory layer to VSMC phenotypic transitions with implications for atherosclerosis development and progression.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Aged livers showed accumulation of CD44-expressing hepatocytes exhibiting enrichment of immune modulatory genes and activation of the immunosuppressive IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathway. Indeed, in adoptive transfer assays, antigen-exposed CD8+ T cells mounted a lower IFNgamma response in aged livers than in young livers, indicating an immunosuppressive aged milieu. Concordantly, spatial analyses showed that the proximal neighbourhoods of Cd44-expressing hepatocytes are enriched in T cells exhibiting reduced cytokine and chemokine gene expression. Finally, hepatocyte-specific knock out of Cd44 mitigated the IL6/JAK/STAT3 gene signature in aged livers. Overall, these findings suggest that CD44 expression in aged hepatocytes promotes activation of the immunosuppressive IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathway and this is associated with impaired T cell effector function.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

RAD54 functions during DSB repair where it removes RAD51 from duplex DNA including heteroduplex DNA which is formed during D-loop formation. This allows subsequent DNA repair synthesis and completion of the HR process. We have previously suggested that RAD54's activity is regulated by never-in-mitosis-gene A (NIMA) related kinase 1 (NEK1) in a cell cycle-specific manner to promote RAD51 removal and HR in G2 phase without interfering with RAD51's fork stabilization role during S phase. Here, we establish that Nek1 regulates the phosphorylation of Rad54 at Ser572 (S572) to promote HR in vivo in adult mice and in vitro in fibroblasts derived from such mice. In contrast, embryonic mice and fibroblasts derived from them do not require Nek1 for HR. We further show that HR requires Rad54 phosphorylation at S572 both in embryonic and adult fibroblasts and that this is mediated in embryonic fibroblasts by Nek3 and Nek5 instead of Nek1. Thus, our work identifies a developmental change in the regulation of HR and uncovers two new factors involved in this process.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

However, phenotypic datasets are often complex, spanning dozens of traits of varying types and units, with correlated variables and unbalanced sampling, posing challenges for robust, reproducible analysis. Existing software solutions are fragmented, usually requiring labor-intensive workflows across multiple tools and manual steps, which undermines reproducibility and hinders comparisons across studies. To address these methodological and practical challenges, I introduce Orangutan, an R package designed to provide a flexible, easy-to-implement framework for comparing groups using mensural and meristic data. Innovation Orangutan provides a flexible and efficient framework for analyzing mensural and meristic data, supporting a full suite of statistical and visualization tools optimized for species diagnosis and population comparisons. The package streamlines the identification of diagnostic, non-overlapping traits between species, while enabling rigorous assessment of both individual and multivariate trait differences in overlapping traits. Core features include optional allometric correction to remove size effects, automated selection of appropriate univariate tests with post hoc comparisons, and integrated multivariate analyses. All outputs, including summary statistics and annotated publication-ready figures, are generated with minimal coding, ensuring accessibility and standardization. Main Conclusions Empirical validation with real-world datasets, including animal and plant species, demonstrates that Orangutan robustly identifies diagnostic traits, reveals both subtle and clear group differences, and achieves high classification accuracy with phenotypic data alone. By automating and unifying key analytical steps, Orangutan promotes reproducibility, transparency, and efficiency in phenotypic research. This package empowers researchers in taxonomy, ecology, and evolutionary biology to adopt quantitative best practices for species diagnoses, facilitating comparative studies and advancing methodological standards in morphological data analysis.

How three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure contributes to these stress responses, particularly under hyperosmotic conditions, remains poorly understood. Here, using time-resolved Hi-C, CUT&Tag, auxin-inducible depletion, and RNA-seq, we map 3D chromatin structure, its molecular drivers, and transcriptional outcomes during the hyperosmotic stress response. Within 1 hour of sorbitol treatment, pre-existing loops and domains undergo genome-wide collapse, accompanied by the emergence of several hundred de novo, sorbitol-induced loops that are more punctate, longer-range, and transient. These newly formed loops weaken over time and largely dissipate by 24 hours, coincident with recovery of pre-existing chromatin structure. Loop reorganization is consistent across human cell types and hyperosmotic stimuli. CUT&Tag and degron experiments reveal that sorbitol-induced loops require cohesin but not CTCF. Newly formed loop anchors are enriched at active promoters containing SP and KLF family motifs. Genes located at these anchors show little immediate transcriptional change but are activated several hours after loop formation, consistent with loops functioning upstream of gene activation.

Capturing the authentic features of the PC demands experimental conditions that preserve its native state, which are difficult to achieve once NPs are removed from their biological milieu. Despite significant progress, current PC quantification methods still rely on separating the NP-PC complex from its native environment, which compromises the coronas integrity and prevents accurate evaluation of its physicochemical properties. Here, we introduce a fractionation-free approach based on synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to quantitatively determine the amount of protein adsorbed onto silica NPs under native conditions. By modeling the scattering contribution of free versus bound proteins, we directly extracted the adsorbed mass in both single-protein (BSA) and complex proteomic (human serum) systems. The resulting adsorption isotherms enabled the determination of thermodynamic parameters such as binding constants and cooperativity, distinguishing between monolayer and multilayer adsorption regimes. Together, these findings establish SAXS as a robust, non-invasive, and quantitative technique for probing the protein corona in situ, without perturbing the native equilibrium.

We identified pronounced regional heterogeneity in Lewy pathology, with cortical inclusions showing diverse maturation stages at the ultrastructural level, ranging from low-density fibrils interspersed with organelles to highly compact fibrillar inclusions. In the SN of DLB donors, we observed the full range of classical nigral LB morphologies previously described in PD. We additionally characterized diverse neuritic -Syn pathologies in DLB and identified a distinct population of electron-dense, degenerating, -Syn-positive cortical neurons not previously reported. Importantly, we found no significant difference in LB ultrastructure between PD and DLB in either cortical or nigral pathology. In contrast, quantitative analysis of >10,000 mitochondria revealed disease- and region-specific signatures of altered mitochondrial homeostasis. Specifically, the density of mitochondria increased in both PD and DLB, but mitochondrial swelling occurred exclusively in PD and was confined to the SN. These findings indicate that LB ultrastructure alone does not distinguish PD from DLB; instead, mitochondrial morphology provides a more sensitive readout of disease identity and regional susceptibility. Overall, we provide a high-resolution framework for human Lewy pathology in PD and DLB, revealing that ultrastructural responses to -Syn pathology are driven primarily by neuronal identity and regional vulnerability.

This study examined age- and sex-related differences in motor unit firing behaviour across young (YG), middle-aged (MA), and older adults (OLD), by integrating high-density EMG motor unit analysis with muscle morphology and daily physical activity measurements. The analysis of single motor unit activity during submaximal isometric contractions of the vastus lateralis revealed that older adults had lower firing rates and a reduced capacity to modulate discharge frequency during force-increasing contractions. In the YG and MA groups, females showed higher motor unit firing rates and variability than males, while in OLD these sex differences were no longer present. Females also demonstrated a steeper decline in firing rate modulation between MA and OLD. Reductions in muscle cross-sectional area and thickness were similar between sexes. Physical activity levels declined with age in both sexes. These findings reveal distinct, sex-specific trajectories of neuromuscular ageing, with females showing greater motor neuron function decline between MA and OLD, in the absence of sex-related differences in the rate of morphological deterioration. The attenuation of sex differences in older age suggests a convergence of neuromuscular profiles with ageing. While physical activity may contribute to the observed sex-specific patterns, other mechanisms related to hormonal shifts warrant further investigation.

L.", "abstract": "Serotonin (5HT) is a critical modulator of brain function and behavior that is dysregulated in alcohol use disorder (AUD). The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) play distinct roles in AUD and undergo functional changes in 5HT signaling following binge drinking, but our understanding of real-time 5HT dynamics in these structures is lacking. We hypothesized that binge drinking would elicit brain-region specific dysfunction in 5HT dynamics during appetitive and aversive stimuli processing. Using fiber photometry with the GRAB5HT sensor, we identified distinct reward and aversion 5HT signaling motifs in the ACC and CeA. Consumption of alcohol and other tastants elicited a suppression of GRAB5HT signal in the ACC and an increase in 5HT signal in the CeA. In contrast, aversive stimuli similarly increased 5HT in both structures. The effect of binge drinking on 5HT function was surprisingly non-uniform, producing brain-region, sex-, and stimulus-specific dysfunction in 5HT signaling that dramatically shifted across weeks of alcohol experience. This suggests that adaptations in 5HT signaling are specific to neural circuits underlying discrete functions. Optogenetically stimulating 5HT terminals in the ACC and CeA increased avoidance behavior without being overtly rewarding or aversive, and stimulating 5HT release in the ACC blunted alcohol drinking. Together, these data identify distinct 5HT reward and aversion signaling motifs in the ACC and CeA and highlight early binge drinking as a critical stage of 5HT adaptation and a potential window for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

With high-resolution imaging, we examined the steady-state organization of mt-condensates in human cells and identified a wide distribution of distances between centroids of mt-condensates, from roughly a micron apart to less than 100 nm, indicative of complete mixing. Live imaging revealed that such organization was dynamic: mt-condensates underwent rapid cycles of mixing and demixing. Indeed, mtRNA transcripts and the mtRNA polymerase co-localized within mixed mt-condensates, while transcription inhibition led to complete dissolution of MRGs, supporting that nascently transcribed mtRNA is a key driver of mt-condensate organization.

Here we consider centrioles and focus on primary cilia in the growing limb, in order to shed light on this organelle's role in these matrix rich tissues, where it is proposed to fulfil a mechanobiological role. A transgenic mouse model, combined with an image analysis pipeline, is able to map cells, cellular size, positions and orientations and centriole position and ciliary axoneme orientation within the epiphysis or growth plate. We used surgical immobilisation to test for a role of ambulatory loading in the organization of these elements. The pipeline is able to accurately portray known patterns, such as cell orientation and size. Analysis across thousands of cells, through regions and zones of multiple murine growth plates, reveals cilia prevalence is increased in the periphery, especially in the resting zone harboring stem cells. Cilia length is greatest in the hypertrophic cells about to die or transdifferentiate, as part of endochondral ossification. Centriole position, including the basal body from which the ciliary axoneme is extended, is not preferentially organized. Surprisingly, cilia axoneme orientation is. Axonemes are directed posterior or anterior, 45 degrees to the axis of the limb, irrespective of their position, which is defined by basal body position. This is unaltered by the removal of ambulatory associated forces in the limb for 2 weeks. Patterns of ciliation may help reconcile the previously observed anisotropic effects of cilia perturbation, focusing study on stem cell-resting chondrocytes and hypertrophy when considering phenotype of cilia cKO mice and skeletal role. Orientation of these putative antennae is governed by centriole position-independent mechanisms and independently to ambulatory loading, indicating an unknown cell intrinsic mechanism or a role for resilient patterns of matrix deposition. The resilient position of axonemes in the limb likely points to their role in integrating biophysical signals during skeletal growth.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Environmental stressors such as drought may disrupt these pathways by altering both resource availability and interactions that regulate both population and community dynamics. While species-level responses to drought are well documented, far less is understood about how drought-driven changes in plant resources initiate bottom-up effects that cascade through multiple trophic levels. Here, we tested how drought affects a plant-herbivore-carnivore system by quantifying plant physiological changes and their cascading effects on herbivore performance, nutritional quality, and carnivore behavior. Drought reduced plant growth and stomatal conductance, which lowered herbivore feeding efficiency, survival, and reproduction. Herbivores feeding on drought-stressed plants also displayed lower protein content and biomass. Drought also suppressed the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), limiting the chemical cues carnivores use to locate prey. Despite higher prey consumption rates in no-choice assays, carnivores suppressed herbivore populations less effectively under drought. At the community level, these disruptions caused disproportionate declines in arthropod abundance and diversity, particularly among carnivores, leading to trophic simplification. These findings show that drought not just reduce resource availability, it disrupts chemical cues and trophic feedbacks that maintain food web structure. By linking changes in resource limitations to community-level responses, this study demonstrates how environmental stressors can weaken top-down control and destabilize multitrophic dynamics. Predicting ecological resilience depends not only on responses but on how stress disrupts the information signals that maintain ecosystem services and function.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

M.; Baucom, R.", "abstract": "Plant defense evolution has often been examined under single-stressor scenarios, overlooking the complex, interacting stressors of natural environments. Recent research incorporating multiple stressors has largely emphasized physiological and molecular responses rather than evolutionary dynamics, leaving such dynamics less explored. To address this gap, we examined the potential for fitness costs and benefits to the herbicide glyphosate and insect herbivory in Ipomoea purpurea (common morning glory). Through a factorial field experiment, we manipulated glyphosate and the insecticide spinosad to estimate selection on glyphosate and herbivory resistance. We found that glyphosate resistance was under positive selection with no detectable fitness costs, whereas herbivory resistance showed neither costs nor benefits. Notably, positive correlational selection favored higher glyphosate and herbivory resistance in the combined-stressor environment, suggesting these traits may be genetically linked. Further, the strength of positive selection on glyphosate resistance depended on the environmental context of herbivory. Together, these results indicate that selection for glyphosate resistance predominantly drives evolution in this system and may promote increased herbivory resistance. By applying a fitness cost-benefit framework to multiple interacting stressors, our study underscores the context-dependent nature of selection on plant defense traits and highlights how combined stressors can shape their evolutionary trajectories.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

S.; Wood, A. J.; Tanis, S.; Peirau Gabarrell, C.; Cohen, P.", "abstract": "Meiotic recombination generates crossovers (COs), reciprocal exchanges between homologous chromosomes critical for accurate chromosome segregation. Inappropriate CO frequency and distribution drive aneuploidy in human oocytes, with error rates up to 10-fold higher than in sperm despite females exhibiting higher CO frequencies. COs form in the context of the proteinaceous synaptonemal complex (SC) that tethers homologs during prophase I. SC length strongly correlates with CO number, and sexual dimorphism in recombination has long been attributed to longer SCs in females. However, this model is challenged by wild-derived PWD mice in which males consistently generate more COs despite having shorter SCs. Here, we exploit natural genetic variation among inbred mouse strains to dissect the structural and regulatory basis of sexually dimorphic CO regulation. Using cytological markers of SC assembly (SYCP3), recombination progression (RAD51, MSH4), class I CO designation (HEI10, MLH1/MLH3), and chiasmata, we show that SC length is not the sole predictor of CO number. PWD males exhibit stronger CO interference and higher CO number than females, despite reduced SC length. Notably, females show reduced efficiency in designating recombination intermediate to become COs, whereas PWD males display exceptional proficiency. Unexpectedly, although class II COs are rare, they play a disproportionate role in ensuring that every chromosome pair receives at least one CO, thereby safeguarding against aneuploidy. Together, these findings challenge the prevailing view that SC length is the primary determinant of sexually dimorphic CO rates and instead highlight sex-specific regulation of CO designation and pathway usage as key drivers of recombination outcomes.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Cells are often embedded within hydrogels to improve physiological relevance by enabling matrix-mediated signaling. However, many designs restrict the number and arrangement of hydrogels or generate gradients in only one dimension, limiting their ability to recapitulate complex tissue architectures. To address this need, we introduce a 3D printed microfluidic insert compatible with microplates that allows patterning of up to ten unique hydrogel arrays in two dimensions and generation of parallel or orthogonal concentration gradients. We first develop a physics-based computational model of hydrogel filling to define design parameters that ensure robust hydrogel patterning.

Single-cell sequencing technologies allow for co-capture of TCR alpha and beta chains, and their antigen specificity can be determined through peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimer binding and capture of a co-attached barcode oligo. However, SC sequencing often includes a high level of dropouts and risk of cross-contamination. Similarly, barcoded pMHC readouts often suffer from significant background noise. These issues complicate the automatic assignment of pMHC recognition to TCR clonotypes. To overcome these challenges, we developed a method for data denoising - Improved T-cell Receptor Antigen Paring 2 (ITRAP2). This approach significantly reduces noise in single-cell pMHC readouts and allows for accurate identification of TCR specificity. ITRAP2 incorporates statistical tests and confidence metrics for each TCR-pMHC pairing, offering user flexibility in pairing rigor, and allows multiple pMHC assignments to the same T-cell clone in the event of cross-binding within the pMHC multimer library. We tested this method on an in-house generated dataset of 8141 single cells, screened for CD8 T-cell binding using a panel of 100 different barcode-labelled pMHC multimers holding virus-derived peptides, and on a larger public dataset from 10x Genomics with 208,589 T-cells evaluated for recognition using a panel of 50 different pMHCs. In both datasets, ITRAP2 was able to recover TCR-pMHC hits that were missed either when investigating the raw data or analyzing the data using alternative tools. Importantly, we demonstrate that the size of the pMHC multimer library is crucial for accurate pMHC-TCR pairing and that a minimum of 25 pMHC multimer should be included to optimally determine background characteristic, and assigning true positive events.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

While increased extracellular heat shock protein 90 (eHSP90) has been linked to increased MMP-2 activity, this has not been examined in the context of cellular stress. Methods: We examined stress-induced eHSP90 in human prostate cell lines by immunoblot. Fluorometric gelatin dequenching and zymography assays measured MMP activity. Wound healing and Matrigel drop invasion assays were used to quantify cell motility. HSP90 knockout (KO) cells were established with CRISPR/Cas9. Proteases were profiled with molecular inhibitors and protein arrays and validated by siRNA knockdown, immunoblot, and motility assays. Results: Stress increased eHSP90 in 4 of 4 human prostate cell lines examined. Surprisingly, it concurrently decreased MMP-2 activity. The functional relevance of this was demonstrated when conditioned media from stressed cells decreased the motility of non-stressed cells. Screening for protease inhibitors that would rescue stress-induced decreases in MMP-2 activity identified a single serine protease inhibitor: aprotinin. Yet, rescue with aprotinin was lost in HSP90 KO cells. A protease array identified stress-induced increases in kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6). Knockdown of KLK6 rescued stress-induced MMP-2 activity and cell motility. Conclusion: We identify a novel stress-induced extracellular network that regulates MMP-2 activity and cell motility.

Exceptional long-term survivors provide a unique opportunity to uncover mechanisms of sustained anti-tumour immunity and guide therapeutic strategies. Here, we present a spatial and temporal dissection of adaptive immunity in an extraordinary 16-year ccRCC survivor, integrating single-cell sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence, B and T cell receptor (BCR/TCR) repertoire analysis, and antibody profiling. We reveal persistent and spatially coordinated B and T cell clones over 16 years, indicating long-term immune memory and surveillance throughout tumour evolution. B cell analysis identified pronounced clonal expansions involving intrinsically autoreactive IGHV4-34 B cells undergoing ongoing germinal centre (GC) maturation in tumour-draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and spleen. These clones progressively lost autoreactivity while acquiring tumour-specificity through somatic hypermutation (SHM), consistent with clonal redemption. Redeemed B cells displayed enhanced antigen-presenting functions and localised to tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), where they interacted with CD8+ T cells, as inferred from doublet analysis. In parallel, persistent CD8+ effector T cell clones highlighted the contribution of long-lived lymphocytes to tumour control. Comparison of the primary tumour and pancreatic metastatic with paired tumour-free dLNs showed that TLS mirrored GC functionality, particularly for PD-1+ CD8+ T cells, while TLS maturation was stroma-dependent and impaired at the metastatic site. Finally, tumour-derived BCRs revealed antibody binding to tumour specific public antigens without cross-reactivity to normal tissue.

Therefore, we investigated whether HR-MDS HSPCs are functionally reliant on NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the nicotinamide salvage pathway of NAD anabolism. NAMPT inhibition significantly decreased NAD(H) in HR-MDS HSPCs. Consequently, NAMPT inhibition reduced the oxygen-consuming capacity of HR-MDS-HSPCs compared to healthy. Importantly, NAMPT inhibition significantly impaired the self-renewal and colony-forming potential, increased cell death and reduced disease burden specifically of HR-MDS HSPCs, compared to healthy controls.

We compared the hybrid model's performance with a simulation-only approach and with ML forces applied through inverse dynamics. We evaluated mean absolute error from lab-based reference data (inverse dynamics from marker and force plate data) from 10 individuals walking. Results: The hybrid model had 29% lower joint moment errors compared to simulations (p<0.001) and 45% lower errors compared to the ML-only approach (p<0.001). It also reduced vertical ground force error by 40% compared to simulations. The hybrid approach improved key metrics of joint loading related to knee osteoarthritis progression by 13-30% compared to simulations. Conclusion: Our hybrid model outperforms purely physics-based and ML approaches for estimating dynamics from smartphone video during walking. Significance: These methods move us closer to fast, accurate, and scalable assessments of whole-body musculoskeletal dynamics, which will enable large out-of-lab biomechanics studies and precision treatment of gait-related conditions.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

While it has been known for over a decade that nearly 40% of the transcriptome in the model plant Arabidopsis oscillates with a circadian rhythm, it is yet unclear to what extent this translates to the proteome. Here, through parallel quantitative proteome and transcriptome time-course profiling of Arabidopsis wild-type plants and a panel of clock deficient plant lines, we show that specific clock genes exercise extensive control over diel proteome rhythmicity, and to a much greater extent than they do the transcriptome. This control results in a clock-dependent synchronization of rhythmic proteins along a bimodal phase distribution that is lost in circadian clock deficient plants. This suggests pervasive post-translational control of gene expression by specific elements of the circadian system, notably the morning expressed LHY/CCA1 module. Our findings imply that the circadian clock exercises much greater control of gene expression through proteostasis mechanisms than previously recognised, necessitating a recalibration of our current understanding of clock proteins as primarily transcriptional regulators.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

A.; Ledesma-Amaro, R.; Prieto, A.; Barriuso, J.", "abstract": "Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is an abundant and renewable feedstock for the sustainable production of bioproducts; however, its industrial exploitation is limited by its complex composition and by the lack of microbial platforms capable of simultaneously degrading and assimilating cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived oligosaccharides. Yarrowia lipolytica lacks the native enzymatic machinery required for this process. In this study, we engineered a multifunctional strain (YBXT-XR-BGL3) able to secrete fungal b-glucosidase (BGL3 or BGL1) and b-xylosidase (BxTw1) from Talaromyces amestolkiae, enabling the hydrolysis of cellobiose and xylooligosaccharides, respectively. In addition, a xylose reductase pathway was introduced to confer xylose assimilation. Because the construction of a single multifunctional strain may impose a significant metabolic burden and reduce fitness, we benchmarked this strain against a division-of-labor strategy. To this end, we also developed a cellobiose-specialized strain (YBGL3 or YBGL1) and a xylooligosaccharide-specialized strain (YBXT-XR). Functional characterization revealed efficient saccharification of cello- and xylooligosaccharides under acidic conditions, with BGL3 outperforming BGL1 in glucose release and BxTw1 exhibiting broad pH tolerance. Under nitrogen-limited conditions, this enabled lipid accumulation of up to 20% from cellobiose in YBGL3 and YBXT-XR-BGL3, and up to 15% from xylooligosaccharides in YBXT and YBXT-XR-BGL3. In co-culture experiments using a mixed substrate (glucose, cellobiose, and xylooligosaccharides), both the multifunctional strain and the consortium produced up to 0.67 g L-1 of lipids. However, the division-of-labor approach led to higher lipid accumulation (34% versus 26.3% in the monoculture), driven by a rapid population shift: following cellobiose depletion (after 72 h), YBXT-XR became predominant and utilized the remaining xylooligosaccharides almost exclusively for lipid synthesis. Overall, this study provides the first demonstration of a Y. lipolytica system capable of simultaneously utilizing cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived oligosaccharides. Moreover, benchmarking a division-of-labor consortium against a multifunctional monoculture highlights a robust strategy to enhance lipid biosynthesis and improve process resilience for LCB valorization.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Few studies have examined how identification decreases over distance along with degradation of identity cues. In this study, we conducted a song transmission experiment to quantify the range at which individual Yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) can be reliably identified. Songs from ten males (20 songs per individual, covering their full repertoire) were broadcast and re-recorded along a 200 m transect using AudioMoth recorders. Comparing manual classification by human observers with BirdNET classifier adapted for individual identification, we assess how well individuals could be distinguished at increasing distances. Humans were confident in assigning identity to a larger proportion of songs. Where identity has been assigned, both human and BirdNET were highly reliable at short distances (up to 50 m) discriminating even between very similar song types shared among males. At moderate distances (100-150 m), simple augmentation boosted BirdNETs performance remarkably, almost matching human classification accuracy. Our results indicate that individual recognition remains reliable up to 100 meters where both accuracy and agreement between assignment methods were high. Our results confirm that automated systems offer promising tools for large-scale, non-invasive individual monitoring, but challenges in accuracy and robustness persist at greater distances. We highlight the difference between signal detectability and individual identification range (much shorter) and its importance for optimizing PAM array designs.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Many annelids (segmented worms) have well-documented cases of regeneration variation along the anterior-posterior (AP) body axis. However, mechanistic explanations for the diverse regeneration outcomes at different amputation positions remain unknown. Capitella teleta is an annelid with robust posterior regeneration ability but lacks anterior regeneration, although anterior regeneration ability has not been rigorously assessed at multiple amputation sites. In this study, we characterize regeneration ability along the AP axis of C. teleta tail fragments by comparing the post-amputation response of tail fragments cut between segments 1 and 2 and tail fragments cut between segments 10 and 11. Through EdU experiments, in situ hybridization assays, and antibody labeling, we demonstrate that the more anterior amputation site proceeds to later stages of regeneration than the posterior amputation site, but regeneration does not go to completion. The distribution of neoblast-like cells after amputation suggests that these cells do not substantially contribute to formation of the anterior-facing blastema in tail fragments with higher inherent regeneration potential. Lastly, we test whether the greater regenerative competence of tail fragments amputated between segments 1 and 2 increases the probability of accomplishing complete posterior regeneration after treatment with CHIR, a Wnt/{beta}-catenin agonist. Regeneration outcomes are comparable following increase in Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling regardless of amputation position, suggesting that initial regeneration potential is not a limiting factor of successful posterior regeneration. Comparing tissues with different regenerative abilities within an individual organism can elucidate mechanisms underlying regeneration regulation, thereby enabling the prospect of rescuing or increasing regeneration ability in regeneration-deficient tissues.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Moreover, its importance in recovery after stroke is known. Yet, how ischemic lesions affect the sleep-wake cycle (SWC) neural dynamics remains poorly explored, with most studies not addressing the multi-scale extent of this pathology effects in brain function. Here, we performed chronic wideband electrophysiological recordings in behaving rats to investigate ischemic stroke impact in the primary motor cortex on SWC organization in connected, non-lesioned, areas of the sensorimotor loop. We combined behavioral assessment with multi-scale analyses spanning global SWC architecture, network level events of privileged functional reshaping during sleep, and single-unit activity. Lesioned animals, exhibiting sharp motor impairments, displayed clear alterations of SWC macro-architecture, including reduced latency to slow-wave sleep and correlations between spectral features and motor asymmetry. At meso-scale, ischemia disrupted the physiological coordination between slow oscillations and spindles, and the latter showed shift in spectral power distribution during intermediate sleep. In contrast, units firing and coupling with spindles were largely preserved. These findings reveal that ischemia perturbs the fine coordination of sleep-related processes across scales stage-specifically. The study lays solid evidence to be possibly leveraged for innovative protocols of neurorehabilitation targeting privileged windows of neuroplasticity.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Although primary auditory cortex (ACtx) has been implicated in constructing noise-invariant representations, it remains unclear which excitatory subpopulations within ACtx carry out this transformation from noise-dependent to noise-invariant coding. To address this, we presented pure tones with and without continuous BN to head-fixed mice and used two-photon calcium imaging to record sound-evoked activity from three major excitatory subpopulations in ACtx: layer (L)2/3 intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, L5 IT neurons, and L5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons. L2/3 IT neurons exhibited strong noise dependence at the level of single-neuron responses, pairwise interactions, and population representations. In contrast, deep-layer pathways showed greater noise invariance, with L5 IT neurons preserving stable representations most consistently and L5 ET neurons exhibiting more limited invariance at the population level. These findings reveal a functional division of labor in ACtx, in which superficial neurons remain noise-dependent and deep-layer broadcast pathways, particularly L5 IT, preferentially carry noise-invariant representations, suggesting that excitatory subpopulations contribute differentially to the construction and propagation of noise-invariant codes.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

We have previously reported that the small GTPase Rab27b modulates autophagic-lysosomal function in neurons and supports lysosomal degradation of syn across multiple syn cellular models. Knockout (KO) and knockdown of Rab27b damage lysosomal degradative capacity and exacerbate syn pathology, while Rab27b overexpression is conversely protective in cellular syn models. Elevations of Rab27b seen in human synucleinopathies suggest a compensatory role for Rab27b in these disorders. Here, we examined the role Rab27b plays in vivo in the context of both A53T genetic syn overexpression and viral AAV syn overexpression mouse models. Rab27b knockout in A53T+ mice did not alter motor behavior or survival. However, Rab27b knockout increased proteinase-K resistant syn in the cortex, striatum, and substantia nigra of A53T mice starting as early as six months of age. Additionally, Rab27b KO increased phosphorylated S129 syn in the cortex and nigra. Astrocyte and microglial activation were also observed upon Rab27b KO in the A53T model. In the AAV syn model, Rab27b KO resulted in accelerated dopaminergic cell loss in the nigra. Collectively, we report that loss of Rab27b results in elevated neuropathology in PD-relevant brain regions, validating its role as a therapeutic target in synucleinopathies.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

In this way we explored the hypothesis that such collective properties inform on brain architectures. Our measurements cover complete parasagittal sections of the mouse brain, in animals one week to 18 months old.

One includes telencephalic regions, one is centered in the midbrain and hindbrain, and one comprises mainly the thalamus and the cerebellum. The structure emerging from our approach aligns with discoveries in studies of regional patterns of cellular gene expressions.

Recent data showed that PAE impairs brain cortical and retinal vasculature leading to defective positioning of interneurons. In the retina, PAE disturbs vascular development and the association of calretinin neurons with vessels. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is a major target of alcohol in the brain, and both ligand binding to NMDARs and the expression of NMDAR subunits are altered in FASD. Given that NMDAR is also expressed in endothelial cells and that glutamate stimulation of endothelial NMDAR (eNMDAR) regulates cortical interneuron positioning along blood vessels, we hypothesize that eNMDAR is critical for retinal vascular development and mediates PAE-induced defects. Using an in vivo model of FASD and transgenic mice lacking, specifically in endothelial cells, the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR, this study aimed to characterize the neurovascular phenotype of the developing retina. The results show that eNMDAR knockout delays the formation of the superficial vascular plexus and prevents the alterations in vascular organization and neuronal density induced by PAE, particularly cells positioned closer to the retinal vasculature, namely ganglion, amacrine, and horizontal cells. Moreover, eNMDAR deletion led to an increased number of calretinin-positive interneurons in contact with perforating vessels and prevents the decrease induced by PAE. Together, these findings demonstrate that eNMDARs are essential for normal retinal neurovascular development and mediate, at least in part, the detrimental effects of ethanol exposure in FASD.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Although EcR is also expressed in GSCs and their differentiating daughters, potential direct roles for EcR in GSCs independent of the soma have not been examined. Here, we demonstrate that EcR functions autonomously in GSCs and cystoblasts to control germline differentiation. While depletion of EcR from GSCs mildly reduces GSC self-renewal, over-expression of EcR specifically in GSCs and cystoblasts impedes germ cell differentiation, phenotypically resembling bag of marbles loss-of-function and Bone Morphogenetic Protein signaling constitutive activation. We propose that while low levels of EcR are essential to maintain GSC self-renewal and permit initial differentiation, higher levels of EcR accumulate in differentiated germ cells to promote transcription of maternal genes, providing temporal control over germline differentiation.

A conserved core set of cardiac transcription factors (TFs) orchestrates these processes through combinatorial interactions that are cell type-specific and tightly regulated across space and time. However, the genomic enhancer architecture that integrates upstream effectors to establish precise cardiac TF dosage and downstream transcriptional output remains largely unresolved. Here, we assessed the functional necessity of five developmental heart enhancer modules previously linked to the regulation of Gata4 and Hand2, core cardiac TFs exhibiting overlapping roles in myocardial and endocardial development. While individual enhancer deletions in mouse embryonic hearts revealed a surprising degree of transcriptional resilience, a subset of Gata4 enhancers proved indispensable for embryonic progression in a genetically compromised background. To achieve higher precision in cardiac cell type-specific enhancer prediction, we applied single-nucleus multiome profiling, enabling the delineation of cardiac cistromes underlying heart morphogenesis. By integrating this resource with deep learning applications, site-directed transgenesis, and chromatin conformation modeling, we mapped the cardiac enhancer repertoire and regulatory signatures that orchestrate Hand2 dynamics across distinct cardiac compartments and lineages. Genome editing further revealed an essential role for the Hand2 upstream regulatory interval (H2-URI) in transcriptional control of endocardial lineage effectors and, consequently, trabecular network formation and cardiac cushion patterning.

R.", "abstract": "Sex differences in human health and disease are shaped by complex interactions between hormones, environment, and genetic factors - including those associated with sex chromosomes. While X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females generally silences one copy of the X to equalize dosage with males, a subset of genes escape XCI and remain expressed from both X chromosomes. In this study, I integrate allele-specific expression data from three females with non-mosaic XCI, sex-biased expression profiles from over 40 tissues, and enhancer activity data from GTEx to explore how variation in the magnitude of XCI escape contributes to sex-biased gene expression across the human body. I confirm that female-biased expression on the X chromosome is a poor proxy for escape from XCI. I find that XCI extends into the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) and that the extent of inactivation strongly predicts male-biased expression of PAR genes. Conversely, stronger escape from XCI in non-PAR X-linked (NPX) genes is associated with more pronounced female-biased expression. Across both PAR and NPX genes, escape patterns are shaped by topologically associating domains (TADs) and sex-biased expression is supported by proximity to sex-biased enhancer activity. These findings reveal a direct, tissue-specific relationship between the strength of XCI escape and the magnitude of sex-biased gene expression, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how the X chromosome contributes to sex-biased biology.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, we amplified and sequenced a gene from Bacillus sp. strain BS, which showed 89.8% identity with bacterial endoglucanase Q6YK34. This putative novel endoglucanase, BsEG2, is a GH5-like endoglucanase, with optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 55 {degrees}C, and efficiently hydrolyzes amorphous and crystalline cellulose, including pre-treated and untreated sugarcane bagasse. Kinetics on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) indicate high substrate binding efficiency (apparent Vmax of 148.9 {micro}M min-1, a Km of 24.9 mg mL-1, and a kcat of 517 s-1). BsEG2 hydrolyzes long cellulosic chains, oligosaccharides, and cellobiose to produce glucose, demonstrating multifunctionality. It exhibits remarkable thermal stability, retaining over 90% activity after 15 days at 55 {degrees}C. BsEG2 also retains activity in high salts and ionic liquids, and is not inhibited by cellobiose, even at 200 mM, unlike other endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases. Furthermore, BsEG2 functions in seawater, reducing freshwater footprint in biofuel production. BsEG2 is a promising candidate for a cost-effective enzyme formulation for glucose production from lignocellulosic biomass, supporting downstream glucose-fed metabolic pathways.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

As such, MD simulations are playing an increasingly important role in understanding the functional roles and molecular interactions of proteins. However, trajectories from these simulations can be extremely large, often reaching tens of gigabytes for a single simulation of modest duration. This creates substantial challenges for storage and data transfer, motivating efficient compression strategies. Furthermore, many downstream analyses require extraction of only a subset of frames or specific atoms from the full trajectory, so an ideal compression format should support rapid random-access decompression of such samplings without requiring full file decompression. Results: Here, we introduce MDCompress, a new trajectory compression format and accompanying software implementation that meets these goals. MDCompress produces compressed trajectory files that are 15-37% smaller than those generated by the widely-used XTC format, while achieving faster compression and decompression speeds through efficient multithreading.

It is characterized by cognitive decline and accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Accumulating evidence indicates that viral infection may worsen and/or increase development of established AD pathology. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurologic conditions that vary in severity and duration, as well as the worsening of clinical symptoms in elderly people with dementia. To better understand potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts AD neuropathology, aged 5xFAD and wildtype (WT) mice were intranasally infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10). Intranasal infection of aged-matched (10-14 month) 5xFAD or wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice with MA10 resulted in viral infection of the lungs that correlated with acute viral pneumonia characterized by lymphocyte inflammation and antiviral immune responses. Viral RNA was not detected within the central nervous system (CNS) of either WT or 5xFAD mice at days 7 or 21 post-infection (p.i.), nor were there signs of overt glial activation or neuroinflammation. There were no differences in either amyloid beta plaque volume or number within the brains of MA10-infected 5xFAD mice compared to uninfected 5xFAD mice. However, bulk RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics revealed evidence of altered expression of genes associated with neuronal and glial dysfunction, as well as reduced expression of genes encoding adhesion molecules in vascular endothelial cells.

This study examined motor unit discharge behaviour in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and thenar during isolated index finger flexion, isolated thumb flexion, and a tip pinch task. Methods: Seventeen participants performed each task at 10%, 20%, and 30% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) while high-density surface electromyograms (HDsEMG) were recorded from both muscles. Motor unit spike trains were completely decomposed from the HDsEMG recordings, tracked across force levels, and their mean discharge rates and recruitment thresholds were calculated. Results: For both FDI and thenar muscles, the mean discharge rate increased with force, but the FDI exhibited steeper slopes than the thenar and at 10-20% MVC than 20%-30% MVC. In addition, lower recruitment thresholds and higher mean discharge rates were observed in the FDI compared to the thenar. Task-dependent differences were also observed in the FDI, with the pinch task yielding higher discharge rates than isolated contractions. In the thenar, differences between tasks were limited to higher forces. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate muscle- and task-specific motor unit modulation across forces in the intrinsic hand muscles, where the FDI relies more on rate coding, while the thenar likely prioritizes recruitment to cope with increased force demands.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we systematically analyzed skeletal muscle transcriptomic responses of 40 exerkines using three publicly available datasets which include MetaMEx, Extrameta and the MoTrPAC rat training study. We analyzed exerkine specific regulation in humans, mice and rats across acute and chronic exercise as well as inactivity, and determined which responses were conserved, species specific, sex dependent or dependent on exercise duration. Our analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in skeletal muscle exerkine regulation with only a small subset showing conserved changes across species, while many exerkines exhibited human exclusive, rodent exclusive, acute specific or chronic specific patterns.

Using OmniProt, a cross-condition neural modeling and interpretive framework, we predicted growth rates across 16 lignin-derived substrate-oxygen combinations, including held-out conditions, demonstrating that growth-relevant information is encoded in the proteome. Interpreting model reliance using Monte Carlo SHAP values and dependence-aware perturbation analyses revealed a compact, hierarchical organization of growth determinants. Despite pronounced oxygen-driven bifurcation in proteome abundance, the features required for accurate growth prediction were largely regime-invariant, defining a conserved biochemical core overlaid by adaptive, condition-specific modulators.

Their function and production adapt in response to inflammatory cues such as cytokines and danger-associated molecular patterns. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin released during tissue damage, particularly in lung inflammation, has been implicated in influencing platelet biology, though its exact effects remain poorly understood. To clarify the role of IL-33, we examined its impact on platelet production, proteome, adhesion, secretion, and aggregation using platelets from IL-33-deficient (IL-33KO) mice and IL-33 stimulation in vivo. Our results reveal that while platelets themselves do not express IL-33, platelets isolated from IL-33KO mice display altered proteomic signatures and reduced adhesion to fibrinogen, podoplanin, and laminin, alongside impaired thrombus formation under shear stress. IL-33 administration in vivo led to proteomic remodeling characterized by increased expression of inflammatory proteins, as well as changes in platelet morphology, including increased size, typically associated with de novo production. Using lung intravital microscopy, we visualized platelet fragmentation within the lung vasculature in real time, and observed enhanced fragmentation following IL-33 stimulation. Interestingly, ST2, the receptor for IL-33, is expressed in subsets of mouse and human megakaryocytes and hematopoietic progenitors, particularly those involved in a non-canonical pathway of thrombopoiesis that enables the rapid replenishment of platelets during inflammation, infection, and aging. Together, these findings identify IL-33 as a pivotal regulator of platelet function and production, linking inflammatory signaling to the dynamic regulation of thrombopoiesis.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

These mutations effectively mediate escape from non-affinity-matured R1-32-like antibodies with germline-like sequences. Here, we characterize four affinity-matured R1-32-like antibodies, C092, C807, BD56-104, and BD56-597, with the ability to tolerate L452SARS2 and F490SARS2 mutations. We show that this tolerance arises from residues introduced by somatic hypermutation at convergent positions across multiple CDR loops and surrounding regions, thereby creating additional contacts that reinforce epitope binding. An unusual N354SARS2 glycosylation site, which emerged in BA.2.86 and became fixed in its descendants, is linked to escape from affinity-matured R1-32-like antibodies, implying ongoing selection by this public antibody class.

Disruption of this process, driven by inflammation or aging, often results in myeloid-biased hematopoiesis and impaired lymphoid lineage output. In this study, we identify interleukin-4 (IL-4) signaling as an important modulator of the lymphoid lineage commitment in hematopoietic multipotent progenitors (MPPs). We show that IL-4 promotes MPP differentiation from myelopoiesis to lymphopoiesis via the STAT6 signaling pathway. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that IL-4 signaling upregulates lymphoid-specific pathways while suppressing myeloid differentiation programs in MPPs, but not in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Mechanistically, FLT3-a class III receptor tyrosine kinase highly expressed in MPPs-interacts functionally with IL-4 signaling to facilitate STAT6 phosphorylation and activation. Notably, IL-4 treatment rejuvenates aged hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, restoring B and T cell output and counteracting inflammaging-associated myeloid bias. These changes are associated with improved immune, metabolic, physical, and cognitive functions, positioning IL-4 signaling-FLT3 cooperation in MPPs as a critical regulator of organism-wide immune fitness.

Results Here we identified high-affinity VHHs also known as single-domain antibodies or Nanobodies that bind to Siglec-1 and allo- or orthosterically modulate ligand binding. VHH 2C2 was shown to bind directly to the ligand binding site of Siglec-1 and blocked binding of ganglioside liposomes and Campylobacter jejuni to monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and ex vivo Siglec-1+ DCs. VHH 2C2 also blocked SARS-CoV-2 binding of moDCs.

Parasite invasion of red blood cells (RBCs) involves secretion of multiple proteins from specialised apical organelles (micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules). These collectively facilitate host cell entry, establish a protective parasitophorous vacuole (PV), and directly and indirectly mediate interactions between the infected RBC (iRBC) and the endothelial wall. The cytoadherence of iRBCs results in sequestration within organs and plays a critical role in pathogenesis and virulence, but the function of many secreted parasite proteins remains poorly characterised.

Ultrastructure expansion microscopy reveals their localisation to the rhoptries in late schizogony, where co-immunoprecipitation assays show they interact with each other. In vivo studies demonstrate that these proteins help the parasite evade spleen-mediated clearance and contribute to disease progression. Deletion of both genes disrupts lipid metabolism and PV membrane morphology, suggesting a role in establishing or maintaining the protective PV membrane. Loss of map1 reduces sequestration of P. berghei iRBCs to adipose tissue, and conditional knockdown of the P. falciparum map1 orthologue results in reduced CD36-mediated cytoadhesion, suggesting a cross-species role in sequestration and cytoadherence.

M.", "abstract": "Background: Respiratory pathogens such as adenoviruses (AdV) and influenza A viruses (IAV) can cause serious upper and lower respiratory infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. However, options for antiviral drugs targeting respiratory viruses are limited. Human beta-defensins (hBDs) are disulfide-rich peptides that demonstrate broad antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and some viruses, while also playing immunomodulatory roles. Among defensins, human beta-defensins (hBDs) are the most prevalent, with six peptides identified: hBD-1 through hBD-6. Nonetheless, the production of hBD-3 during respiratory virus infections has not been extensively studied, nor has the effect of hBD-3 on these infections. Objective: This study investigated whether infection with AdV-5 or IAV induces hBD-3 expression in human airway epithelial cells and whether a recombinant form of hBD-3 (rhBD-3) can inhibit in vitro infection by these viruses, one DNA virus and one RNA virus. Methods: In vitro models of human airway epithelial cells (A549 and HEp-2) infected with AdV-5 and IAV were established. In vitro expression of hBD-3 mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR; hBD-3 protein was examined using immunofluorescence and Western blot. The inhibition of viral infection by hBD-3 was quantified using cytopathic effect and plaque reduction assays. Additionally, epithelial cells of animal origin, MDCK and MDBK, were similarly tested for rHBD-3 antiviral activity against IAV infection. Results: IAV and AdV infections significantly increased hBD-3 mRNA levels in A549 and HEp-2 cells. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting confirmed the presence of hBD-3 protein on the surface of IAV-infected cells. Cells infected with AdV-5 produced less hBD-3 protein. Additionally, rhBD-3 inhibited both AdV-5 and IAV infections in both cell lines at concentrations of 7.5-50 g/mL, with the strongest effect at the highest concentration. Lastly, rhBD-3 also inhibited IAV infection in MDBK and MDCK cells within the same range. Conclusions: In vitro infection of human airway epithelial cells with IAV and AdV induces hBD-3 mRNA and protein expression. In turn, rhBD-3 inhibits viral infection in a dose-dependent manner in HEp-2 and A549 cells against these viruses, an RNA virus and a DNA virus. hBD-3 is expressed and localized on the surface of infected cells. rHBD-3 also inhibits IAV infection in bovine and canine epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that hBD-3 plays a broad-spectrum role in defense against respiratory viruses in humans and animals and modulates the innate immune responses.

Their expression products are constituted of about 85 amino acids, including a signal peptide, and are folded into two -helical segments connected by a short unstructured coil. Three conserved disulphide bridges between cysteines located in symmetrically mirrored positions connect the two helical domains. The two ends of the chain are thus brought together and the elongated and compact shape suggests that of a nail, potentially able to penetrate the cell membrane. A high abundance of hydrophobic residues supports such hypothesis. These peptides, that we name Hairpin Loop Peptides (HLPs), have been found in the genomes of many Fungi species but only in selected clades. Orthologues have also been discovered in the genomes of some insects, notably Hemiptera, a few other arthropods and other organisms, but are absent in plants. They appear to have originated in Fungi and then migrated to insects through horizontal gene transfer. The antimicrobial activity of HLPs is predicted by several software programmes, although this still needs to be confirmed by experimental evidence. The occurrence of HLPs in several edible mushrooms supports potential uses of these peptides in food preservation and possibly also in medical applications. Their simple and nearly rigid structure can be easily modified to improve specificity, stability and solubility, thus making these molecular weapons suitable for a variety of different applications.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Recently, catechin amendment of thawed permafrost soil microcosms demonstrated >80% decrease in methane production over 35 days compared to unamended controls, with metagenome, metatranscriptome and metabolome analyses revealing a shift in prokaryotic carbon metabolism from a syntrophic network feeding methanogens to one dominated by catechin fermentation. Here we leverage these same data to investigate potential virus impacts on this microbial community metabolism shift. In total, 900 DNA virus operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) were identified as actively lytic based on transcribed structural and lysis genes. Of these, 41% were predicted to infect at least one of 56 transcriptionally active prokaryote genera representing 13 phyla. The most active vOTUs were predicted to infect key catechin-degrading genera including Clostridium and undescribed Bacillota genus JAGFXR01. Temporally, viral communities responded later than prokaryotes to catechin amendment, reflecting a virus production lag to targeting key microbial responders. An induced prophage represented by a vOTU predicted to infect JAGFXR01 dominated the catechin-amended viral community response. It reached abundances 20-156 times higher than its host, suggesting intense viral lysis that could release degraded catechin intermediates. Indeed, catechin intermediate gene expression in non-catechin-degraders were elevated in catechin-amended samples, suggesting JAGFXR01 lysis products were taken up by non-catechin-degraders as part of community carbon metabolism rewiring. Together, these results potentially place viruses at the heart of carbon rewiring that modulates ecosystem outputs of climate-critical thawing permafrosts.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

The intensity and duration of bloom peaks in Florida estuaries vary interannually, but life cycle transitions, estuarine water residence time, water temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations appear to contribute to bloom formation. However, the impact of B-vitamin availability on P. bahamense bloom formation has not been investigated, despite the knowledge that many HAB dinoflagellates require B-vitamins for growth and bloom development. In this study, we determined that of the three B-vitamins most commonly required by marine phytoplankton--biotin (B7), thiamine (B1), and cobalamin (B12)--P. bahamense strictly requires an exogenous B12 source to support growth. As bacterial interactions can fulfill phytoplankton B12 requirements, we tested whether bacterial communities recruited from two Florida estuaries could rescue P. bahamense from B12 limitation. We demonstrate that bacteria from the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) estuary collected during a P. bahamense bloom restored P. bahamense growth in media missing B12, while bacteria present in Old Tampa Bay (OTB) water collected when P. bahamense was not present did not restore P. bahamense growth in media missing B12. Putative bacterial B12 producers exclusively recruited from IRL included Enterobacteraceae genera that likely have anthropogenic sources. Our findings suggest B12 is essential for fueling P. bahamense blooms, and that specific bacterial communities may contribute to bloom development through B12 production.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

In Bacillus subtilis, PG synthesis involves class A PBPs that act independently and class B PBPs that function in complexes for cell elongation (the elongasome) and division (the divisome). Here, we identify RpdA (formerly YufK) as a specific regulator of PBP4. Inactivation of either vegetative class A PBP (PBP1 or PBP4) by the {beta}-lactam antibiotic cefuroxime (CEF) is toxic and their loss confers CEF resistance. Similarly, loss of RpdA increases CEF resistance and genetic epistasis studies reveal that RpdA functions in a pathway with PBP4. In the absence of RpdA, PBP4 is no longer membrane localized. Analysis of a predicted RpdA-PBP4 protein complex suggests that RpdA has a second function in addition to serving as a membrane scaffold. Induction of RpdA reduces sensitivity to an undecaprenyl-phosphate binding antibiotic, consistent with a role in recycling of this important lipid carrier.

Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel lytic bacteriophage, vB_NeuP-Nir1 (Nir1), infecting the model AOB Nitrosomonas europaea . Phage Nir1 was highly virulent, ceased ammonia oxidation within hours, and caused complete lysis of host populations even at multiplicities of infection as low as 10-6. Electron microscopy revealed drastic host cell remodeling during infection, including pronounced cell bloating and large-scale disintegration of intracytoplasmic membranes. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that loss of these ATP and reducing equivalent generating membrane systems was accompanied by signatures of compromised lipid homeostasis and collapse of autotrophic CO2 fixation. In parallel, Nir1 infection induced metabolic rewiring of the host, including upregulation of uptake systems for nucleic acids, amino acids, and small organic compounds, increased expression of iron acquisition and putative iron-dependent respiratory components, as well as accumulation of metabolites associated with membrane breakdown and stabilization of viral DNA. Together, these results provide the first detailed mechanistic insight into phage-induced host modulation in a chemolithoautotrophic nitrifier.

In practice, phage therapy is not always successful, leaving room for improvement. Here we use computational models to investigate whether some standard phage properties (burst size, lysis, adsorption, decay rate, growth rate) might serve as predictors of treatment success. As our measure of treatment success, we deviate from many other approaches by calculating the number of phage needed to suppress bacterial densities 100-fold in the short term, given that the patient's immune system is expected to regain control once bacterial numbers are reduced. Numerical analysis of 2400 combinations of different values of phage phenotypes reveals that, on average, adsorption rate and growth rate provide the most useful predictive values, decay rate provides some value, whereas burst size and lysis time offer essentially little or no value. Bacterial density is especially informative of the number of phage required for treatment. There is nonetheless often considerable variation around average behavior for a single phenotype. These results raise the possibility that adsorption rate and growth rate may be especially important in phage therapy performance for both high and low bacterial densities. Given that therapeutic phages are often evolved in vitro for broad host ranges rather than for individual hosts, it should be considered that selection for broad host range may have a downside of compromising adsorption to and growth rate on individual bacterial hosts.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

A.; Shapiro, R. S.", "abstract": "The rising rate of drug-resistant fungal infections and the emergence of fungal pathogens with intrinsic resistance phenotypes are a growing concern. The close evolutionary distance between mammals and fungi complicates the design of new antifungals and increases the chances of toxic off-target effects. As such, antifungal drug development usually focuses on fungal-specific proteins when considering potential new targets. Ideal drug targets should mediate essential cell processes and be highly sensitive to inhibition. Targeted gene repression can serve as a model for drug-mediated inhibition and for determining the dosage-sensitivity profile of genes of interest. In the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, classical approaches for gene repression can be labour-intensive and limited to one genetic background due to low throughput. Here, we adapt pooled CRISPRi in C. albicans for the first time and exploit this technique for large-scale functional genomic analysis. Through pooled CRISPRi screening, we test the repression sensitivity of over a hundred essential genes conserved in fungi but absent in humans in a single flask, and successfully identify highly dosage-sensitive genes across multiple cell components and pathways. We further extended our analysis to ten diverse environmental conditions, allowing us to measure how the environment influences dosage-sensitivity profiles. Finally, we extend our experiments to two clinical drug-resistant C. albicans strain backgrounds and demonstrate that many of the fitness defects we observed are conserved in resistant clinical isolates. Together, our results highlight a set of genes that are highly dosage-sensitive across different genetic and environmental contexts, making them attractive targets for further investigation. By facilitating rapid, efficient large-scale functional genomics assays across diverse genetic backgrounds, CRISPRi pooled screening will open new frontiers in C. albicans biology.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

The evolved strain CipRr exhibited elevated resistance towards ciprofloxacin with cross-resistance to other fluoroquinolones, such as ofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and collateral sensitivity to the protein synthesis inhibitors chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Compared to the WT cells, CipRr showed elevated production of secondary metabolites actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin, altered morphology, and reduced ROS production.

We found that while the splice acceptor sequence is optimal, both potential upstream polypyrimidine tracts regulate splicing, the 5' region acting positively and the 3' region negatively to maintain M1 expression. We could not unambiguously identify the mRNA2 branch point, but two closely spaced motifs can act redundantly. Saturation mutagenesis of the mRNA2 splice donor sequence showed that it is nearly optimal but that nucleotides 51 and 55 modestly downregulate splicing efficiency. Most introduced mutations that change splicing balance are nonsynonymous in M1. Nevertheless, mutations in the polypyrimidine tract and branch points that significantly perturbed M1:M2 balance resulted in viable viruses. In contrast, the splice donor sequence was intolerant of mutation.

We have previously demonstrated that yet-uncultured bacteria have the genomic capacity to produce side-chain methylated sterols de novo. Further, we identified three bacterial SMTs capable of producing 24-isopropyl sterols and showed that each of these SMTs was biochemically sufficient for all three of the side-chain methylation steps necessary for 24-isopropyl sterol synthesis. To date, no eukaryotic SMT has been identified that is capable of sequentially adding three methyl groups to generate this propyl structure. To better understand this unique biochemical feature of bacterial SMTs and to potentially identify key amino acid residues involved in sequential methylations on the sterol side-chain, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of propylating bacterial SMTs. Through these analyses, we identified a glycine residue that is necessary but not sufficient for side-chain propylation. This residue is located outside known SMT substrate-binding domains, but inside the active site of an SMT protein model docked with 24-methylenecholesterol. We also show that phenylalanine residues in sterol-binding Region I increase the production of 24-isopropyl sterols, and that 25 residues are conserved among methylating, ethylating, and propylating SMTs. Together, the presence of these residues may allow us to predict if an organism has the genomic capacity to produce C-24 propylated sterols directly from sequencing data, and to generate hypotheses about the environments in which bacterial sterol side-chain propylation may be occurring through analysis of metagenomes. Given the high preservation potential of side-chain alkylated sterols and their use as molecular fossils indicative of ancient life deep in time, a better understanding of the distribution of these unique lipids in modern life and present-day ecosystems will allow for more robust interpretations of side-chain alkylated steranes in the rock record.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that sublethal concentrations of AGXX strongly enhance aminoglycoside-mediated killing across a diverse panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive MDR clinical isolates, including highly aminoglycoside-resistant strains. Combinational treatments significantly reduced the effective concentrations of gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and amikacin required for bacterial killing. Mechanistic analyses revealed that AGXX/aminoglycoside co-treatment induces a pronounced intracellular ROS accumulation, leading to severe proteotoxic stress, extensive protein aggregation, and DNA damage. Scavenging ROS abolished synergistic killing, establishing oxidative imbalance as the primary driver of the synergy between both antimicrobials. We further identify polyphosphate as a key bacterial defense mechanism that mitigates ROS accumulation, proteotoxicity, and genotoxic stress during combinational treatment. Moreover, AGXX/aminoglycoside synergy was preserved in artificial urine medium and across clinical UPEC isolates, underscoring the relevance for urinary tract infections.

Full spectrum flow cytometry (FSFC) offers high-dimensional proteomic analysis at single-cell resolution, yet its application to non-immune cells, particularly endothelial cells (EC) from solid tissues, is limited due to their complex autofluorescence signatures. We developed and optimized a FSFC protocol to overcome this challenge, enabling robust phenotyping of endothelial subpopulations, downstream high dimensional analysis and isolation of rare EC subpopulations from murine liver and heart tissues. Highlights Optimisation of a FSFC panel to enable in-depth phenotyping of tissue- and model-specific endothelial subpopulations from solid tissues. Discussion of appropriate controls to minimize the impact of tissue autofluorescence and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for cell phenotyping in complex models of inflammation and fibrosis. Trajectory analysis to track cellular plasticity over time. Application of full spectrum cell sorting to isolate rare endothelial subpopulations with complex phenotypes. Summary FSFC is an emerging technology that can greatly enhance our understanding of the single-cell proteomic landscape. However, its application to cells derived from solid tissues has been hampered by their complex autofluorescence signatures and lack of optimized tools for non-immune cells. Here, we present a protocol and discuss key controls that minimize the impact of unmixing errors enabling us to resolve multiple EC subpopulations isolated from different tissues in models of chronic tissue injury.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

DNA methylation contributes to the elaboration of phenotypes and is hypothesized to account for interindividual variations in farm animals. Currently, methodologies available to investigate DNA methylation in cattle rely on high throughput sequencing, which cannot be applied to large cohorts. To enable large scale DNA methylation analysis, we developed the RUMIGEN EpiChip, the first DNA methylation array specifically designed for cattle. Results. Manufactured by Illumina, the EpiChip contains 43,317 CpG markers allowing analysis of phenotypes of agronomical interest as well as the study of regulatory processes. The assay design drew on data from numerous studies achieved by the scientific community, and includes CpGs where methylation varies with health status, physiological stage, fertility, and environmental challenges, as well as CpGs located in functional genomic elements (promoters, CTCF binding sites, expression quantitative trait loci). The technical performances of the EpiChip were tested on several semen and blood DNA samples and in two laboratories, showing excellent repeatability, accuracy and interoperability. Methylation values were also concordant with those obtained by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. The EpiChip has demonstrated a good ability to explore biological processes such as genomic imprinting and differences between cell types, opening the possibility of inferring blood cell composition. Finally, analysis of longitudinal ear biopsies allowed accurate age prediction, suggesting the potential of the array to refine epigenetic clocks. Conclusions. The RUMIGEN EpiChip is a cost-effective and versatile resource that opens new opportunities for the study of regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation and for large-scale association analyses in cattle.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Upon binding ligands and molecular glues, CRBN undergoes a significant structural rearrangement from an open to closed state, defined by the positioning of the thalidomide-binding domain (TBD) with respect to the Lon domain. However, the exact molecular basis for this ligand-induced conformational change and its implication to neo-substrate degradation remain elusive. During our campaign to discover novel CRBN binders, we found hits exhibiting distinct biophysical behaviour from classical thalidomide-based ligands. By combining orthogonal biophysical methods of differential scanning fluorimetry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and small-angle X-ray scattering, supported by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM structures of ligand-bound complexes, we classify CRBN binders between those that can induce CRBN closure, and those that cannot. Mutational studies identify key residues in the CRBN ligand binding pocket and N-terminal belt that are essential for the Lon and TBD domains to come together in the closed state. Finally, we show that the probability to yield active degrader molecules is greatly influenced by whether binders can or cannot induce CRBN closure. Together, our study reveals new molecular insights into the structural basis for how CRBN open-closed equilibrium is directly modulated by compound binding and impact target degradability by CRBN, with important implications to the design of PROTACs and molecular glue degraders.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

We subsequently designed a hybrid composite biomaterial to act as an implantable reprogramming workshop that perform sequential operations. Once injected, this bespoke system forms a tissue mimetic hydrogel encouraging the ingress of astrocytes to act as our raw material. We demonstrate that the system localized and enhanced the spatially confined delivery of reprogramming factors, entrapping astrocytes to then pass through an intermediate neuroblast state to robustly yield mature neurons.

For example, in teeth, the abrupt transition between soft (approx5 kPa) dental pulp and stiff (more than100 kPa) dentin directs the alignment of odontoblasts. In this study, hydrogels, with defined mechanical transitions were used to evaluate the phenotypic response of fibroblasts to either a soft/soft (3 kPa/3 kPa) or soft/stiff (3 kPa/200 kPa) interface. Near the soft/soft interface fibroblasts aligned in a more parallel fashion to the interface (11 degree angle to the interface), compared to the more perpendicular fashion (69 degree angle to the interface) observed at the soft-stiff interface. Notably, regions of alignment also showed an increased proportion of alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)-positive cells, indicating myofibroblast differentiation in response to the mechanical transition. These findings demonstrate that modifying a biomaterial by introducing an interface alters the bioactivity of responding cells solely through mechanical mechanisms, without any change to the cells biochemical environment.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Here we develop a pan-HTT-targeting CRISPR-Cas9 system that, when delivered to the striatum of R6/2 and YAC128 mice by AAV5, lowered mutant HTT mRNA and protein by 55-80% via its induction of frameshift-inducing indel mutations in HTT exon 1. Cas9 targeting improved motor coordination and locomotor activity, decreased anxiety-like deficits, reduced clasping and weight loss, limited striatal atrophy, and decreased the formation of intranuclear inclusions immunoreactive for the mutant HTT protein. In Hu21/21 mice, which carry the wild-type human HTT gene in lieu of the mouse ortholog, Cas9 lowered the HTT protein by 44% but induced no measurable behavioral deficits and had no adverse effect on neuronal viability, though its targeting was associated with neuroinflammation.

The framework achieves second-level runtime efficiency and enables accurate alignment across heterogeneous spatial omics datasets, as well as between spatial omics and histology, without manual effort or modality-specific tuning. Across diverse datasets, SPOmiAlign consistently achieves higher alignment accuracy than existing state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate its utility through automated registration of spatial omics data to a common coordinate framework (CCF), enabling anatomical annotation.

While biochemical mechanisms of ridge initiation and growth are increasingly well understood, the physical principles governing ridge-pattern organisation remain unclear. Here, we show that fingerprint ridges can be treated as a frozen nematic field on a bounded surface, exhibiting long-range orientational order and singularities. Modelling ridge orientation as a two-dimensional nematic director field on the functional contact area of the fingertip, we apply a generalised Poincare-Hopff theorem to derive a topological constraint on permitted configurations. Triradii, loops, and whorls correspond to -1/2, +1/2, and +1 nematic defects, whose total charge is set by surface topology and boundary winding. Across 133 fingerprints from open-access databases, 95.5% satisfy the predicted charge-neutrality condition. Although boundary winding is typically below the idealised value (W_partialS = 0.71 +/- 0.12 vs W_partialS ~= 1), fingerprints above a threshold (W_partialS >= 0.6) consistently maintain zero net charge, revealing a coarse-grained realisation of the underlying topological rule.

Recent work has focused on defining this aggressive group. To better characterize this clinically distinct, high-risk group, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from human meningiomas using a dimension-reduced reference landscape. We identified an NF2 mutant subtype enriched for chromosome 10q loss and low PTEN expression, both of which were strongly associated with shorter time to recurrence. To directly test causality, we engineered several genetically accurate, immunocompetent in vitro and in vivo mouse models with Pten knockdown or knockout. Across models, Pten loss markedly accelerated YAP1-driven tumorigenesis. Projection of Pten-deficient mouse tumors onto bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets from human meningiomas revealed that mouse tumors faithfully recapitulate the transcriptional programs of aggressive NF2 mutant meningiomas and robustly predicted clinical outcomes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PTEN loss cooperates with YAP1 activation to drive aggressive NF2 mutant meningioma biology, and that the high fidelity of this model to human disease establishes it as a robust platform for mechanistic investigation and therapeutic testing.

Older and younger adults performed a choice-stepping go/no-go task in which the likelihood of initiating a step was manipulated across trials. We measured anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), the preparatory shifts in body weight that precede stepping, and modelled age-related differences in APA onset using a hierarchical Bayesian framework.

Experimental mice were generated via in utero electroporation of a gain-of-function RHEB variant (RHEBp.P37L).

Using this acute paradigm, as a proof-of-concept, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of a subset of excitatory neurons within the dysplasia significantly elevated the threshold for hyperthermia-evoked seizures. We then confirmed the relevance of this acute finding to spontaneous epileptiform activity, using repeated chemogenetic inhibition across chronic recordings to confirm a reduction of spontaneous seizures as well as interictal spikes.

The oscillating eye movements of infantile nystagmus come with reduced visual acuity, strongly impairing quality of life. No cure exists for this condition. Previously, we demonstrated that nystagmus in the CSNB mouse model Nyxnob has a retinal cause. Specifically, we found that synchronized oscillations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are transmitted to the accessory optic system, triggering compensatory eye movements. The RGC oscillations appear to originate from a specific retinal cell type, the AII amacrine cell (AII AC), making these cells the preferred target for treatment. Here we found that pharmacologically activating the dopaminergic input to AII ACs in Nyxnob mice completely suppresses the pathological oscillations of both AII ACs and RGCs and improves the signal fidelity of RGCs. Moreover, our retinal network simulations confirm that the experimentally observed changes to AII AC voltage-gated currents are sufficient to account for the dopamine-dependent abolishment of these oscillations.

Current in vitro NVU platforms typically exclude microglia and lack perfusable vascular networks with physiologically relevant architecture. Here, we established complementary two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) NVU models to investigate microglia-endothelial and microglia-neurovascular interactions. Methods: Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived-neurons (iNs), astrocytes (iAs), and microglia-like cells (iMGLs) were incorporated into a soft-lithography based engineered microvessel system to establish a multicellular neuroimmune-vascular model. To specifically evaluate iMGL-endothelial cell (EC) interactions, iMGL were co-cultured with primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and junctional protein localization was evaluated using immunofluorescence. The barrier integrity of engineered microvessels containing iMGL was evaluated using dextran permeability. Our 2D and 3D systems were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) to evaluate whether iMGL would promote or attenuate EC inflammation and barrier breakdown. Results: Incorporation of iNs, iAs, and iMGLs into a perfusable vascular model enabled a more complete representation of NVU cellular diversity and promoted neuronal health. In monolayer co-culture with iMGL, HBMECs enhanced the junctional localization of tight and adherens junction proteins through both contact-dependent and paracrine mechanisms. Following an inflammatory challenge, iMGLs reduced endothelial inflammatory activation, suggesting a protective role in response to AD-relevant inflammatory conditions. Finally, when embedded in 3D collagen matrices surrounding perfusable endothelialized lumen networks, iMGLs reduced dextran permeability and preserved endothelial barrier integrity following TNF challenge. Conclusions: Together, these findings establish a 3D perfusable neuroimmune-vascular model that enables the dissection of microglial contributions to neurovascular function in health and disease.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify intracisternal a-type particle (IAP) elements, specifically the IAPEz-int family, as the likely source of VLPs in the mouse placenta. IAPEz-int instances are expressed throughout placentation and contain intact gag and env sequences critical for the formation of immature and mature particles, respectively. To elucidate a role for IAPEz-int derived VLPs in the mouse placenta, we generated a knock-in mouse containing a full-length element tagged with HA/FLAG. Using this line, we demonstrate that fetal IAPEz-int traffics into and across the maternal decidua. In total, we suggest that placental VLPs derive from IAPEz-int, and demonstrate their potential to traffic into maternal tissues, suggesting a role for these structures in maternal-fetal communication at the placental interface.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

T.; Bailey, J.; Johri, P.", "abstract": "Malaria has caused over 15.7 million deaths in the 21st century and was responsible for ~600 thousand deaths globally in 2023 alone. Although many effective antimalarial drugs have been developed and widely adopted to reduce the occurrence and severity of the disease, recurrent resistance to frontline treatments remains a major concern. Multiple drug resistance alleles at intermediate and high frequencies have been identified in specific Asian and African populations of P. falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite. With improvements in sequencing throughput and global efforts such as the MalariaGEN project to build genomic surveillance, we now have access to tens of thousands of P. falciparum genomes from across the world. With this data, it is becoming increasingly possible to employ powerful population genetics approaches to understand the selective pressures and demographic history of the parasite. While several empirically motivated outlier-based approaches have been employed to identify targets of drug resistance, there is a lack of a framework that jointly accounts for the multiple concurrent processes occurring in natural populations of P. falciparum. We argue that a baseline evolutionary model that accounts for simultaneously acting evolutionary processes is needed to understand patterns of genomic variation in P. falciparum populations. Here, we identify key components essential for building such a baseline model for the malaria-causing pathogen. Such effort will be important to develop an appropriate null model to test evolutionary hypotheses using genomic datasets, will provide a path forward to improve the accuracy of inference of evolutionary parameters, and help identify new gene candidates involved in drug resistance.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

However, conventional workflows can suffer from poor peak shapes, limited pressure tolerance, co-elution of polar metabolites, and unstable retention times. Here, we describe the development of a more stable HILIC method for LC-MS metabolomics of human plasma and cell extracts, optimizing a zwitterionic HILIC (Z-HILIC) column for improved untargeted performance. We found that using high-pH ammonium bicarbonate with 90% acetonitrile in mobile phase B (ABC B) can greatly improve peak shapes of select metabolites when compared to 100% acetonitrile (ACN B), but at the cost of poor retention time stability. We therefore focused on optimizing chromatography for the ACN B method and observed that cooling the column to 5 C substantially enhanced peak shape. This low-temperature Z-HILIC (LT-ZHILIC) method provides high-resolution separation of metabolites from both cellular extracts and human plasma, is stable over days, and generally outperformed a standard method using the widely described ZIC-pHILIC column. Application of the untargeted LT-ZHILIC method to characterize the metabolic consequences of glutamine and pyruvate deficiency in human cells revealed a striking change in nucleotide phosphates; a perturbation that was not observed in the ZIC-pHILIC analysis of the same samples likely due to inadequate elution profiles. In sum, the LT-ZHILIC workflow offers a robust platform to advance untargeted metabolomics by improving metabolite coverage, resolution, and retention time stability, making it a promising technique for providing novel insights into cellular metabolic rewiring and the human plasma metabolome.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Background: Psychiatric disorders frequently accompany primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs), implicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a shared biological substrate for psychiatric vulnerability. To determine how familial mitochondrial risk influences neuronal development in bipolar disorder (BD), we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and cortical neurons (CNs) from three healthy controls (CT), three patients with BD, and three patients with BD and a family history of mitochondrial disease (BD-FMD). Methods: Across differentiation, we assessed mitochondrial function (ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS generation, cytosolic cell-free mtDNA), metabolomic signatures, calcium imaging, and neuronal electrophysiological activity through multi-electrode arrays (MEA). Results: BD neurons uniquely exhibited pronounced hyperexcitability in comparison to CT and BD-FMD groups. The BD-FMD group displayed prolonged mitochondrial calcium transients, altered membrane potential, and aberrant ROS, in comparison to CT and BD, consistent with a sustained energetic deficit. Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct pathway enrichments in BD and BD-FMD, indicating divergent bioenergetic adaptations to mitochondrial burden. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that familial mitochondrial liability actively reshapes neuronal differentiation and function, producing distinct trajectories of mitochondrial performance, calcium signaling, and network excitability. These results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in BD is not a secondary byproduct of illness, but a mechanistic contributor to altered neuronal energetics and communication. Together, these findings delineate how inherited mitochondrial vulnerability reshapes neuronal excitability and metabolism, revealing bioenergetic phenotypes that may inform precision stratification and therapeutic targeting in BD.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

J.; del Rosario-Vargas, E.; Dogandzic, T.; Crofoot, M.; Zwyns, N.", "abstract": "Over the last few decades, the developing field of primate archaeology has used archaeological methods to reconstruct primate behaviors, especially tool use. We expand the possibilities of primate archaeology with an inverse approach: using living primates to address archaeological questions. In particular, we investigate tool selectivity, a phenomenon that not only represents a significant milestone for tool users, also for the emergence of stone tool technology in human evolution. Observing extant primate tool use can establish clear expectations for a percussion-based archaeological record across taxa. Here, we describe stone tools assemblages produced by two independent populations of white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) in Coiba National Park, Panama, and provide evidence of stone tool selectivity in both populations. We demonstrate that capuchins select for tool dimensions, and select different sizes for different tool functions. This selectivity analysis reveals that primate stone tool use results in assemblages of artifacts that are distinct from natural accumulations of unused material in the surrounding landscapes. These variations further suggest that stone tool use has a recognizable signature at the assemblage level, even where no lithic flaking occurs. The existence of such assemblage-level signatures offer new avenues for the archaeological identification of tool use both in unhabituated living primates and extinct taxa. The presence of selectivity in multiple capuchin populations suggests that, along with percussion, tool selectivity is ancestral to stone tool flaking, and is shared by phylogenetically distant branches of the primate tree.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Recently, it has been shown that rhythm itself can be used as an information coding channel. Now we ask: does this hold true for arrhythmic sequences? To answer that, we analysed songs of the tawny pipits (Anthus campestris), migratory songbirds known for their simple songs. Using focal recordings of 384 individuals from six populations collected across their European breeding range, we calculated an extensive set of rhythmic and temporal indices to describe each song. First, the pattern of these songs was inspected and shown to be arrhythmic. Second, songs belonging to specific individuals and populations were compared using permuted discriminant function analysis and supervised uniform manifold approximation and projection. To describe the level of individuality of the rhythmic structure alone, we calculated Beecher's statistic for all songs, as well as the potential of identity coding for each parameter separately. We show that tawny pipit males sing using individual rhythmic patterns in their arrhythmic songs, and that modern rhythmic indices, such as beat precision and integer ratios, are among some of the most individually distinct parameters of their songs. Furthermore, contrary to previous investigations based on the spectral shape and basic frequency and temporal characteristics of these songs, we show that the species displays population-specific temporal patterns, with significant differences throughout its European range. This study is the first to demonstrate geographic scale differences in birdsong rhythm, and to show that rhythmic analysis can provide useful descriptions of arrhythmic sequences.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

M.; Buckner, R. L.", "abstract": "Human prefrontal cortex (PFC) is heterogenous. In monkeys, side-by-side PFC regions, including within dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), show distinct long-range anatomical projection profiles, raising the possibility that adjacent regions might specialize as a consequence of the distributed networks in which they are embedded. Consistent with this possibility, recent findings in humans provide evidence for PFC regions domain-specialized for scene (spatial) processing and language processing that are adjacent to distinct domain-flexible regions responding to traditional cognitive control demands. Here we tested functional specialization of PFC regions linked to another domain-specialized network recruited by certain forms of social processing (theory-of-mind, ToM, tasks). Using within-individual precision neuroimaging approaches, side-by-side DLPFC regions embedded within parallel distributed networks were identified within the idiosyncratic anatomy of each individual (N=13). Functional responses between these distinct regions revealed a robust functional double dissociation: one DLPFC region was preferentially recruited by ToM tasks and an adjacent DLPFC region by working memory task demands. The region responding to social processing demands was small and its position varied slightly from one person to the next suggesting why it may have been underappreciated in past group-based analyses. These findings add to evidence that PFC features more functional specialization than commonly appreciated and further that the specialization of juxtaposed regions within PFC can be understood by examining the distributed networks within which the regions are embedded.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that WM tracts are differentially positioned in the cortical hierarchy to support specific cognitive functions, and that tracts spanning the hierarchy connect regions with greater cognitive diversity. Moreover, tracts situated within the same hierarchical level connect biologically similar regions, while those crossing the hierarchy bridge distinct biological milieux to support diverse cognitive functions. The placement of tracts in the cortical hierarchy also reflects developmental variation in tract microstructure and individual differences in cognition. Together, these findings provide a framework that moves beyond conventional categories of association or projection tracts and links WM tract anatomy to cortical organization, cognitive function, cortical neurobiology, and neurodevelopment. We anticipate that this cortex-anchored framework for describing WM tracts may aid the interpretation of individual differences in WM structure related to development and behavior.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

The relationship between gene expression alterations and energy metabolism defects, however, is poorly understood. Here we combined differential expression (DE) analysis with computational modeling to investigate how the expression of cytosolic energy metabolism-associated genes influences the concentrations of key energy metabolites. The DE analysis used human post-mortem RNA sequencing data from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from the Common Mind Consortium. Metabolic simulations were carried out using a biophysical model of brain energy metabolism (Winter et al. 2018). We conducted both population-average and subject-specific simulations and assessed the effects of DE genes individually and collectively.  The DE analysis identified nine genes in the ACC and 24 in the DLPFC. Approximately two thirds of the DE genes were downregulated in schizophrenia in both brain areas. Decreased expression of neuronal  LDHB  in the ACC caused a decrease of pyruvate and an increase of NAD+/NADH ratio. Furthermore, decreased expression of neuronal PFKM in the DLPFC caused an increase of glucose and NAD+/NADH ratio and a decrease of pyruvate, lactate, and ATP. These findings provide evidence for region-specific dysregulation of brain energy metabolism in schizophrenia and suggest mechanistic links between gene expression changes and altered levels of key energy metabolites.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

While most prior work has focused on resting-state functional connectivity or task-evoked activation, how amyloid-beta relates to task-modulated connectivity that directly supports behavior is less explored. Here, we examined the relationship between amyloid-beta burden and task-modulated connectivity during a Letter Sternberg verbal working-memory task in eighty-four cognitively normal older adults from an ongoing longitudinal cohort (age 56-71 years; 41 female). To further understand these connectivity alterations, we tested whether these connections were associated with task performance or with cognitive reserve factors. We found that higher amyloid-beta burden was associated with reduced connectivity specifically during the probe phase of working-memory retrieval. At the regional scale, lower node strength in posterior-medial regions of the default mode network was related to worse task performance and mediated the amyloid-behavior relationship. At the network scale, altered coupling between the default mode and dorsal attention networks was related to task performance but did not mediate the amyloid-behavior relationship. Moreover, physical activity was associated with network-level coupling but not with regional node strength. These findings suggest that amyloid-beta burden disrupts retrieval-related working-memory systems, particularly regions of the default mode network that are vulnerable to amyloid-beta, while coupling between the default mode and dorsal attention networks indexes resilience. Collectively, task-modulated connectivity provides insight into pathways through which early Alzheimer's disease pathology influences working-memory performance and resilience and may inform targeted lifestyle or neuromodulation interventions for older adults.", "date": "2025-12-22", "journal": ""}

Overall, we observed that older cohort exhibit better circum-cerebral structural connectivity as (i) cuneus to superior frontal gyrus (ii) superior frontal gyrus to inferior frontal gyrus (iii) inferior temporal gyrus to inferior frontal gyrus and (iv) cuneus to inferior temporal gyrus. Another, significant neuroprotective anatomical signature was revealed, namely a connectivity through vertical occipital fasciculus across cuneus to temporal cortex in male and female older cohort.

We recorded intracranial EEG while neurosurgical patients produced matched sentences by singing or speaking, sampling millimeter- and millisecond-scale activity across bilateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC). During articulation, high-frequency activity (70-150 Hz) lateralized oppositely across behaviors, with right-dominant SMC activation for singing and left-dominant activation for speaking. Mu-band (~10 Hz) synchrony further differentiated the dynamics: speaking showed an early left-led pattern, whereas singing exhibited a ramping of synchrony within the left sensorimotor cortex and between the two motor cortices, supporting progressive interhemispheric recruitment. Frequency-domain Granger-Geweke causality revealed that the left primary somatosensory cortex drives both motor cortices at speech onset. In contrast in singing, control over motor cortices relied on both hemispheres. These results provide evidence that song and speech rely on dissociable sensorimotor dynamics.
