Herein, we describe a mouse embryonic stem cell (SC)-derived 3D hemogenic gastruloid (haemGx) that captures multi-wave blood formation, progenitor specification from hemogenic endothelium (HE), and generates hematopoietic progenitors capable of short-term engraftment of immunodeficient mice upon maturation in an in vivo niche. We took advantage of the haemGx model to interrogate the origins of infant acute myeloid leukemia (infAML). We focused on MNX1-driven leukemia, representing the commonest genetic abnormality unique to the infant group. Enforced MNX1 expression in haemGx promotes the expansion and in vitro transformation of yolk sac-like erythroid-myeloid progenitors at the HE-to-hematopoietic transition to faithfully recapitulate patient transcriptional signatures. By combining phenotypic, functional and transcriptional profiling, including at the single-cell level, we establish the haemGx as a useful new model for the study of normal and leukemic embryonic hematopoiesis.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Therapeutic options are limited due to a lack of understanding of the cell populations that contribute to these processes. Here, we identified the epitenon as a major source of cells that contribute to both peritendinous fibrosis and regenerative tendon healing following acute tendon injury. Using a combination of genetic lineage tracing and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we profiled the behavior and contributions of each cell fate to the healing process in a spatio-temporal manner. Integrated scRNA-seq analysis of mouse healing with human peritendinous scar tissue revealed remarkable transcriptional similarity between mouse epitenon-derived cells and fibroblasts present in human peritendinous scar tissue, which was further validated by immunofluorescent staining for conserved markers. Finally, ablation of pro-fibrotic epitenon-derived cells post-tendon injury significantly improved functional recovery.

A subset of 1,954 (HEK293) and 1,253 (RCC4) high confidence, non-collagen proline hydroxylation sites were inhibited by FG-4592 treatment. Features characteristic of proline hydroxylated peptides, were identified, which were consistent between the HEK293 and RCC4 datasets. The more hydrophilic HILIC fractions were enriched in peptides containing hydroxylated proline residues, which showed characteristic differences in charge and mass distribution, as compared with either unmodified, or oxidised peptides. Furthermore, we discovered that the intensity of the diagnostic hydroxyproline immonium ion was dependent upon parameters including the MS collision energy setting, parent peptide concentration and the sequence of amino acids adjacent to the modified proline. We show using synthetic peptides that a combination of retention time in LC and optimised MS parameter settings allows reliable identification of proline hydroxylation sites in peptides, even when multiple prolines residues are present. Focussing on proteins in which newly identified proline hydroxylation sites were inhibited by the pan-PHD inhibitor, FG-4592, showed enrichment for proteins involved in metabolism of RNA, mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation, including the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit, Repo-Man (CDCA2).

Still, how these biotic interactions jointly determine competitive dominance remains largely unknown. We tackle this by coupling population models and laboratory experiments with two sibling species of spider mites. Using experiments specifically designed to measure the single and combined effects of food competition and reproductive interference, we first show that the strength and symmetry of reproductive interference between species changes in presence of food competition. Next, we show that population models incorporating each type of interaction alone lead to markedly different predictions, from exclusion of the inferior competitor for food, to priority effects instead favouring the latter under the sole effect of reproductive interference. Moreover, accounting for the observed reduction in the strength of reproductive interference in the presence of food competition changes the threshold frequency determining the dominant competitor when both interactions are at play, from equal chances for the two species to exclude the other depending on their initial frequency, to favouring the superior competitor for food except when it is extremely rare. Finally, we showed that the model generates accurate predictions for population dynamics in an independent population cage experiment, indicating that our approach captures the most relevant processes governing the outcome of interactions between competing spider mite species. Altogether, our results suggest that trophic interactions can modulate sexual interactions, significantly impacting population dynamics and competitive outcomes. Hence, the joint consideration of food competition and reproductive interference is critical to accurately predict and understand species coexistence.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Here we report that arterial specification is determined by fluid shear stress (FSS) independent of VEGFR2 signaling and that, in contrast to the current paradigm, VEGFR2 signaling must decline for arteriogenesis to fully take place. VEGF-A does not induce arterial fate in capillary endothelial cells, instead, serving as a critical physiological brake to counteract FSS-driven capillary-to-arterial cell fate transition to maintain the capillary state. The transcription factor Sox17 is the key mediator of the FSS-induced arterial program and a target of VEGF-FSS competition.

The ability to generate PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) from pluripotent stem cells has advanced our knowledge of gametogenesis and holds promise for developing infertility treatments. However, generating an ample supply of PGCLCs for demanding applications such as large-scale genetic screens has been a limitation. Here, we demonstrated that simultaneous overexpression of 4 transcriptional factors - Nanog and three PGC master regulators Prdm1, Prdm14 and Tfap2c - in suspended mouse epiblast like cells (EpiLCs) and formative embryonic stem cells (ESCs) results in efficient and cost-effective production of PGCLCs. Nanog overexpression enhanced the PGC regulatory network, suppressed differentiation of somatic lineages, and maintained PGC fate. PGCLCs generated in this manner have transcriptomes similar to in vivo PGCs and are more advanced than cytokine-induced PGCLCs. These differentiated PGCLCs could be sustained over prolonged periods of culture and could differentiate into spermatogonia-like cells in vitro. We exploited this platform to conduct a bulk epigenome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify genes that decreased the efficiency of PGCLC formation when downregulated. One of the identified candidates was Ncor2, a transcriptional repressor that acts via recruitment of Class I and Class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs). Consistently with this finding, the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid (VPA; an anti-convulsant) and sodium butyrate (SB; a widely-used dietary supplement) suppressed PGCLC differentiation. Furthermore, exposure of developing mouse embryos to SB or VPA caused hypospermatogenesis.

F.; Serences, J. T.", "abstract": "Understanding 3D representations of spatial information, particularly in naturalistic scenes, remains a significant challenge in vision science. This is largely because of conceptual difficulties in disentangling higher-level 3D information from co-occurring features and cues (e.g., the 3D shape of a scene image is necessarily defined by spatial frequency and orientation information). Recent work has employed newer models and analysis techniques that attempt to mitigate these in-principle difficulties. For example, one such study reported 3D-surface features were uniquely present in areas OPA, PPA, and MPA/RSC (areas typically referred to as 'scene- selective'), above and beyond a Gabor-wavelet baseline (\"2D\") model. Here, we tested whether these findings generalized to a new stimulus set that, on average, dissociated static Gabor-wavelet baseline (\"2D\") features from 3D scene-surface features. Surprisingly, we found evidence that a Gabor-wavelet baseline model better fit voxel responses in areas OPA, PPA and MPA/RSC compared to a model with 3D-surface information. This raises the question of whether previous findings of greater 3D information could have been due to a baseline condition that didn't model some potentially critical low-level features (e.g., motion). Our findings also emphasize that much of the information in scene-responsive regions--potentially even information about 3D surfaces--may be in the form of spatial frequency and orientation information often considered 2D or low-level, and they highlight continued fundamental conceptual challenges in disentangling the contributions of low-level vs. high-level features in visual cortex.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Amidst this backdrop are health disparities emerging in these populations. Furthermore, the global spread of industrialization raises concern for the increasing prevalence of modern diseases.1 For instance, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in prevalence globally, and alarming evidence reveals a specifically increased risk in young Indian immigrants and Indians born in several westernized countries.2-4 In 2019, India had an incidence rate of 2.34, whereas South Asians in Canada showed an incidence rate of 14.6 per 100,000 person-years, which was comparable to the general population in Canada.5,6 A likely contributor to this elevated risk in westernized countries like Canada may stem from changes in the gut microbiome as a response to living in an industrialized environment. The industrialized microbiome has been previously characterized by the decline of VANISH (volatile and/or associated negatively with industrialized societies of humans) taxa, frequently found in populations adhering to traditional lifestyles, and the rise of BloSSUM (bloom or selected in societies of urbanization/modernization) taxa, which appear in modern, industrialized individuals.7,8 Furthermore, health consequences following the assimilation into westernized culture have been previously documented. For example, non-industrialized Irish Travellers who adopted modern practices and Hmong and Karen migrants from Thailand who relocated to the United States (US) both experienced gut microbiome shifts that were associated with an increased risk for metabolic disorders.9,10 Currently, there is only one study published on the Indian immigrant gut microbiome, highlighting the gap in non-western/non-European microbiome research. Indeed, over 71% of all microbiome research comes from westernized cohorts, skewing our interpretation of a healthy human gut.11 Here, we aimed to investigate the distinction between the Indian and westernized gut microbiomes and the differences in the gut of Indians who migrate to Canada, alongside the adoption of the westernized diet.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Nonetheless, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how predation influences microbial communities in future climate scenarios and an increasingly nutrient-rich world. Here, we assess whether predation by key bacterial consumers--ciliates--influences a microbial community's freshwater temperature and nutrient response regarding biomass, diversity, structure, and function. In a three-week microcosm experiment, we exposed mostly prokaryotic microbial communities to a community of ciliate predators at two different temperature scenarios (ambient and +3{degrees}C, i.e., a conservative projection of climate change by 2050) and nutrient levels (low and elevated). Nutrients, temperature, and ciliate presence influenced microbial biomass and function separately, but their interaction had the largest explanatory power over the observed changes in microbial community biomass, structure, and function. Our study supports previous findings that temperature and nutrients are essential drivers of microbial community structure and function but also demonstrates that the presence of predators can mediate these effects, indicating that the biotic context is as important as the abiotic context to understand microbial responses to novel climates.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) remains the deadliest gynecological cancer, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and high rates of chemotherapy resistance and recurrence. Lack of representative preclinical models complicate the challenges of discovering effective therapies, especially for platinum-resistant OC. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models maintain the genetic characteristics of the original tumor and are ideal for testing candidate therapies in vivo, but their high cost limits their feasibility for high-throughput drug screening. Organoid models mimic the tumor's 3D structure and preserve intra-tumoral heterogeneity. While organoids established directly from primary patient tumors are the optimal model for personalized drug response studies, the supply of primary tissue is often limited. Patient-derived xenograft tumors can be passaged in mice and provide a renewable source of cancer cells for organoids. This study aimed to determine if PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs) can reflect patient responses to chemotherapy similarly to primary patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Methods: 3D tumor organoid cultures were established from paired primary OC and PDX samples. Organoid viability after 72-hour treatment with paclitaxel (PTX), carboplatin (CBDCA), or their combination was compared between organoids derived directly from the patient or from the PDX models. The in vitro drug responses of PDXOs and PDOs were then compared to defined patient clinical responses: platinum-sensitive (initial response to standard platinum/taxol therapy lasting >6 months post-treatment), platinum-resistant (initial response to standard chemotherapy lasting < 6 months), or platinum-refractory (no initial response to standard chemotherapy). Results: In drug response assays, PDXOs and PDOs demonstrated similar sensitivity to standard chemotherapy and also reliably reflected patient responses based on the clinical designation of platinum sensitivity. While organoids derived from the ascites were smaller with a denser morphology, their drug response mirrored that of the organoids derived from solid tumor. Platinum-sensitive cases exhibited significant reductions (around 50% reduction) in organoid viability when treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel, or their combination. Platinum-resistant or refractory organoids showed little to no reduction in viability with carboplatin or paclitaxel monotherapy or the combination. Organoids derived from one platinum-resistant case did show a small but significant reduction in viability with single-agent paclitaxel, suggesting that organoid models might predict response to second-line paclitaxel therapy. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that PDXOs respond to drugs similarly to PDOs and confirms that both models effectively mirror patient response to standard chemotherapy. This highlights the potential of PDXOs as renewable models for screening novel therapies and developing personalized strategies in OC.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

To determine if these pathways regulate EV release, we used flow cytometry to follow the transfer of EVs carrying lipid-associated GFP and surface IgM from donor to recipient B cells. Using chemical and genetic inhibition, we found that a PI3K/mTORC2/ROCK/actin pathway regulates bioactive EV formation via activation of acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) upstream of PI3K. Using single EV analysis, we found that CD24 regulates the formation of the subset of bioactive EVs that are taken up by recipient cells and not total EVs. Interestingly, we also found that ROCK and aSMase modulate ectosome but not exosome formation, when CD24 is stimulated. Lastly, through live cell imaging, we found that PI3K and ROCK are required for inducing membrane dynamics associated with EV formation.

To address this, we developed the Rational Action, Noisy Choice for Habituation (RANCH) model, which operates over raw images and makes quantitative predictions of participants' looking behaviors in a classic visual habituation paradigm. In a series of pre-registered experiments, we exposed infants and adults to stimuli for varying durations and measured looking time to familiar and novel stimuli.

Here, we explore whether a cryptic pocket in the Interferon Inhibitory Domain (IID) of viral protein 35 (VP35) of Zaire ebolavirus aids its ability to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We use simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and dsRNA binding of the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston and Marburg. These homologs have nearly identical structures but block different interferon pathways due to different affinities for blunt ends and backbone of the dsRNA. Simulations and thiol-labeling experiments demonstrate that the homologs have varying probabilities of pocket opening. Subsequent dsRNA-binding assays suggest that closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone. Point mutations that modulate pocket opening proteins further confirm this preference. These results demonstrate the open cryptic pocket has a function, suggesting cryptic pockets are under selective pressure and may be difficult to evolve away to achieve drug resistance.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

However, the genetic and epigenetic changes influencing the immune response on host infected cells remain unclear. Here, this study analyzes HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) during early infection (<6 months) using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing. It is observed that HIV-1 hinders the antiviral response, particularly by interfering with the interferon signalling pathway. Multimodal analysis identifies KLF2 as a key transcription factor in infected CD4+ T cells. Moreover, cells harbouring HIV-1 provirus are predominantly identified as Th17 cells, which exhibit elevated KLF2 activity. This suggests an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and a constrained immune response due to the quiescent characteristics of these cells. The finding provides insights into the immune mechanisms and key regulators of HIV-1 maintenance in CD4+ T cells during the early stages of infection.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

While the mechanisms that restrict body fat in males are becoming clearer, less is known about how females achieve higher fat storage. Here, we perform a detailed investigation of the mechanisms that promote higher fat storage in females. We show greater intake of dietary sugar supports higher fat storage due to female-biased remodeling of the fat body lipidome. Dietary sugar stimulates a female-specific increase in Drosophila insulin-like peptide 3 (Dilp3), which acts together with greater peripheral insulin sensitivity to augment insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS) activity in adult females. Indeed, Dilp3 overexpression prevented the female-biased decrease in body fat after removal of dietary sugar. Given that adult-specific IIS inhibition caused a female-biased decrease in body fat, our data reveal IIS as a key determinant of female fat storage.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

PYK2, as an innovative immunomechanical checkpoint, de facto governs this differentiation process. We demonstrated that PYK2 senses mechanical signals via Piezo1 and integrins, triggering F-actin polymerization and translocating to the nucleus to regulate mechanotransduction and differentiation genes (e.g., ACTR3, RELA). Targeted deletion of PYK2 impairs the differentiation and polarization of monocyte-derived macrophages, reshapes the PDAC microenvironment, and enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These findings underscore the critical role of mechanical cues in monocyte differentiation and suggest that targeting PYK2 is a promising strategy to modulate TAM function and improve immunotherapy outcomes in patients with PDAC.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

L.; Nestor, A.; Niemeier, M.", "abstract": "Recent research shows that the intention to act on an object alters its neural representation in ways as afforded by underlying sensorimotor processes. For example, the intention to grasp and pick up an object results in representations of the object's weight. But these representations become grasp-specific only immediately before object lift if weight information is relayed through object material. This feature triggers earlier representations regardless of intention probably because material-weight contingencies are overlearned. By contrast, recently learned weight cues should be recalled deliberately during grasp planning resulting in early grasp-specific representations. Here, we examined how action intentions affect the representation of newly acquired colour-weight contingencies. We recorded electroencephalography while human participants grasped or reached for objects that varied in shape and density as indicated by their colour. Multivariate analyses revealed a grasp-specific reactivation of colour during planning that was mirrored in beta band. This suggests that task-relevancy influences the representation of colour such that previously encoded colour-weight contingencies may be reactivated as required for grasping, mediated top-down via working memory. Grasp-specific representations of shape and colour were also present in theta band, perhaps reflecting attentional activity.

To facilitate this task, we devised a method for assigning the amino acid residue sequence to the backbone fragments traced in an input cryo-EM map (EMSequenceFinder). EMSequenceFinder relies on a Bayesian scoring function for ranking 20 standard amino acid residue types at a given backbone position, based on the fit to a density map, map resolution, and secondary structure propensity. The fit to a density is quantified by a convolutional neural network that was trained on ~5.56 million amino acid residue densities extracted from cryo-EM maps at 3-10 Angstrom resolution and corresponding atomic structure models deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB). We benchmarked EMSequenceFinder by predicting the sequences of 58,044 distinct [a]-helix and {beta}-strand fragments, given the fragment backbone coordinates fitted in their density maps. EMSequenceFinder identifies the correct sequence as the best-scoring sequence in 77.8% of these cases. We also assessed EMSequenceFinder on separate datasets of cryo-EM maps at resolutions from 4 to 6 [A]. The accuracy of EMSequenceFinder (63.5%) was better than that of three tested state-of-the-art methods, including findMysequence (45%), ModelAngelo (27%), and sequence_from_map in Phenix (12.9%). We further illustrate EMSequenceFinder by threading the SARS-CoV-2 NSP2 sequence into eight cryo-EM maps at resolutions from 3.7 to 7.0 Angstrom. EMSequenceFinder is implemented in our open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) program.

In this work, we investigated the Mn-sensing translational riboswitches in E. coli (mntP and alx), which differ in aptamer secondary structure, nucleotide sequence, and pH-dependence of Mn response. We performed co-transcriptional RNA chemical probing, allowing us to visualize RNA folding intermediates that form and resolve en route to the final folded riboswitch. For the first time, we report that sampling of metal ions by the RNA begins before the aptamer synthesis and folding are complete. At a single-nucleotide resolution, we pinpoint the transcription window where \"riboswitching\" occurs in response to Mn binding and uncover key differences in how the alx and mntP riboswitches fold.

Unlike the original PSIICOS (Phase Shift Invariant Imaging of Coherent Sources) approach, designed to suppress spatial leakage from all the sources, CD-PSIICOS dynamically adjusts the projection based on the active source distribution, enabling more accurate suppression of spatial leakage while preserving true zero-phase interactions. We validated CD-PSIICOS using realistic simulations and a multi-subject MEG dataset. The results demonstrate that CD-PSIICOS outperforms the original PSIICOS in suppressing artifacts at the lower projection ranks, maintaining robust detection of functional networks across theta and gamma frequency bands.

During rest, offline replay integrated piecemeal memories into a coherent 2D representation, predicting the emergence of a grid-cell-like code that reflected a generalizable task schema. This schema reduced the need for effortful computations during subsequent inference. During inference, two types of on-task replay emerged: a fast replay, resembling offline replay and representing the full map, and a slow replay, focused on trial-specific details.

In many contexts, from soils to host-associated communities, highly diverse microbes are organized into metabolic groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. The resource preferences of individual taxa that give rise to these guilds are critical for understanding fluxes of resources through the community and the structure of diversity in the system. However, inferring the metabolic capabilities of individual taxa, and their competition with other taxa, within a community is challenging and unresolved. Here we address this gap in knowledge by leveraging dynamic measurements of abundances in communities. We show that simple correlations are often misleading in predicting resource competition. We show that spectral methods such as the cross-power spectral density (CPSD) and coherence that account for time-delayed effects are superior metrics for inferring the structure of resource competition in communities. We first demonstrate this fact on synthetic data generated from consumer-resource models with time-dependent resource availability, where taxa are organized into groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. By applying spectral methods to oceanic plankton time-series data, we demonstrate that these methods detect interaction structures among species with similar genomic sequences.

To address this, we generated high-quality long-read sequencing data for 40 inbred strains; and designed a pipeline to optimally identify and validate different types of SVs. This generated a database for 40 inbred strains with 573,191SVs, which included 10,815 duplications and 2,115 inversions, that also has 70 million SNPs and 7.5 million insertions/deletions. Analysis of this SV database led to the discovery of a novel bi-genic model for susceptibility to a B cell lymphoma that spontaneously develops in SJL mice, which was initially described 55 years ago. The first genetic factor is a previously identified endogenous retrovirus encoded protein that stimulates CD4 T cells to produce the cytokines required for lymphoma growth.

In this study, we identified miR-130b as a critical regulator of B cell tolerance through its suppression of Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERa). Elevated levels of miR-130b impaired the elimination of autoreactive B cells by clonal deletion via downregulation of ESR1 (which encodes ERa) and PTEN, allowing their escape into peripheral tissues where they can contribute to autoimmunity. Deficiency in ERa expression alone was sufficient to allow the escape of self-reactive B cells to periphery in female, but not male, mice. Furthermore, elevated levels of miR-130b in patients with multiple sclerosis associated with increased disease activity and severity.

There are two major challenges: it is difficult to separate the effect of the genotype-phenotype (GP) map from that of natural selection in causing natural patterns of diversity, and most extant phenotypes evolved long ago in species whose GP maps cannot be recovered. Using reconstructed ancestral transcription factors as a model to address this problem, we created libraries containing all possible amino acid combinations at historically variable sites in the proteins' DNA binding interface (the genotypes) and measured their capacity to bind specifically to response elements containing all possible combinations of nucleotides at historically variable sites in the DNA (the phenotypes). The ancestral proteins we used existed during an ancient phylogenetic interval when a new phenotype - specificity for a new response element - evolved. We found that the two ancestral GP maps were strongly anisotropic (the distribution of phenotypes encoded by genotypes is highly nonuniform) and heterogeneous (the phenotypes accessible around each genotype vary dramatically among genotypes), but the extent and direction of these properties differed between the maps. In both cases, these properties steered evolution toward the lineage-specific phenotypes that evolved during history. Our findings establish that ancient properties of the GP relationship were causal factors in the evolutionary process that produced the present-day patterns of functional conservation and diversity in this protein family.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

However, between three and two thousand years before present (BP), Celtic was widely spoken across most of Europe before being largely replaced by Germanic, Latin or Slavic1-4. Despite this rich history, how Celtic spread across the European continent remains contentious5. The debate is currently focused around three main models based on historical linguistics and archaeology: (1) a Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age spread from Central Europe associated with the Hallstatt and La Tene Cultures6-9; (2) a Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age spread along the Atlantic seaboard linked to the Bell Beaker Culture10-13; and (3) a Bronze Age spread from France, Iberia or Northern Italy14-16. Previous genomic investigations are centred around the arrival of Celtic to specific regions: Britain17, Iberia18 and Southwestern Germany19. Here, we utilise new genomic data from Bronze and Iron Age Europe to test how the population histories align with the three models of prehistoric spread of the Celtic languages. In line with the theory that Celtic spread from Central Europe during the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age, we find Urnfield-related ancestry - specifically linked to the Knoviz subgroup to have formed between 4 and 3.2 kyr BP, and subsequently expanded across much of Western Europe between 3.2 and 2.8 kyr BP. This ancestry further persisted into the Hallstatt Culture of France, Germany and Austria, impacting Britain by 2.8 kyr BP and Iberia by 2.5 kyr BP. Our findings thus agree with the model of Central European spread of the Celtic languages through consecutive expansions of the Urnfield, Hallstatt and La Tene Cultures rather than the competing models.

We discuss the various aspects of parameterizing a NCAA for use in Rosetta, identifying rotamer distribution modeling as one of the most impactful factors of NCAA parameterization on Rosetta performance. To this end, we also present FakeRotLib, a method which uses statistical fitting of small molecule conformer to create rotamer distributions.

N.", "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most commonly studied marker in ecological epigenetics, yet the performance of popular library preparation strategies and bioinformatic tools is seldom assessed and compared in genetically variable natural populations. We profiled DNAm using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), including technical and biological replicates from lab-reared and wild-caught threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We then compared how the most commonly used read mapper and methylation caller (Bismark) performed relative to two alternative pipelines (BWA mem or BWA meth read mappers analyzed with MethyDackel). BWA meth provided 50% higher mapping efficiency than BWA mem and 45% higher efficiency than Bismark. Despite differences in mapping efficiency, BWA meth and Bismark produced highly similar methylation profiles, while BWA mem systematically discarded unmethylated cytosines. Sequencing depth filters had large impacts on CpG sites recovered across multiple individuals, with the largest impact on WGBS data. Notably, the prevalence of CpG sites with intermediate methylation levels is greatly reduced in RRBS data compared to WGBS, which may have important consequences for functional interpretations. We conclude by discussing how library construction and bisulfite alignment wrappers can influence SNP filtering, genomic coverage, and the abundance and reliability of data available for downstream analysis. Our analyses suggest that researchers studying genetically variable populations may prioritize filtering SNPs by constructing RRBS libraries with small insert sizes and paired end reads, which is counter to conventional wisdom.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate the role of genetic context in shaping evolutionary divergence within multi-gene duplications, leveraging microsynteny to differentiate source and target copies. Using a dataset of 193 mammalian genome assemblies and a bird outgroup, we systematically analyze patterns of sequence divergence between duplicated genes and reference orthologs. We find that target copies, those relocated to new genomic environments, exhibit elevated evolutionary rates compared to source copies in the ancestral location. This asymmetry is influenced by the distance between copies and the size of the target copy. We also demonstrate that the polarization of rate asymmetry in paralogs, the \"choice\" of the slowly evolving copy, is biased towards collective, block-wise polarization in multi-gene duplications. Our findings highlight the importance of genetic context in modulating post-duplication divergence, where differences in cis-regulatory elements and co-expressed gene clusters between source and target copies may be responsible.

We introduce a previously undescribed communication display in two cuttlefish species: Sepia officinalis and Sepia bandensis. The four \"arm wave signs\" are stereotyped arm movements consisting of long-lasting, expressive, and repeated sequences of undulations of the arms, which can be combined and expressed following specific patterns. Using non-invasive behavioral experiments, we tested the hypothesis that they represent multimodal communication displays. To assess the role of visual cues, we recorded videos of animals signing and played them back to individual cuttlefish participants. When seeing the movies, cuttlefish waved back at the display. Most importantly, they were more likely to wave back when the movie was in upright (original) configuration as opposed to flipped upside-down, similar to the manner in which humans perceive faces and other socially relevant displays. In addition to their visually striking display, arm wave signs produce mechanical waves in the water, prompting us to explore the possibility that they may also be perceived via mechanoreception. Using playback experiments similar to those adopted in vision, we obtained preliminary evidence to support this hypothesis, indicating that arm wave signs may represent multimodal signals involving vision and mechanoreception. Our new result on communication with arm wave signs opens up novel possibilities for understanding vibration-mediated communication through the lateral line and/or the statocysts in a cephalopod species as an example of convergent evolution with vertebrates.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

In the human brain, studies have shown that novelty responses are enhanced in regular compared to random auditory contexts, but the underlying neuronal circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined how inhibitory neurons contribute to context-dependent novelty responses in mouse auditory cortex (AC). Using two-photon calcium imaging in AC of awake head-fixed male and female mice, we recorded neuronal activity during presentation of spectro-temporally rich ripple sounds, with novel ripples embedded in either regular or random ripple sequences. AC neurons exhibited stronger responses to novel sounds in regular contexts compared to random ones. To identify circuit mechanisms, we selectively inactivated parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) inhibitory neurons during the novel stimulus presentation. Inactivation of PV and SST neurons broadly increased novelty responses in both contexts. In contrast, VIP inactivation selectively reduced responses to novel stimuli in the regular, but not random, context, decreasing the context-dependent novelty signal enhancement. At the population level, inactivating all three neuronal subtypes increased detectability of the novel stimulus, but only for VIP inactivation, the effects were context dependent. These findings reveal a distinct role for VIP neurons in modulating novelty signals based on context regularity, suggesting that VIP circuits are critical for context-sensitive auditory processing and predictive coding.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

F.; Himes, B. T.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain cancer with near-universal recurrence despite maximal treatment for which new innovations are sorely needed. Immunotherapy has yet to make significant gains in GBM treatment despite revolutionizing other cancer therapies, due in part to GBM-mediated immune suppression. This immune derangement proceeds through several mechanisms, but increasing evidence points to critical roles for tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and immunosuppressive myeloid cells as key factors in this process. In the present study, we demonstrate broad expression of TIGIT across myeloid cell populations in the GBM microenvironment, a finding recapitulated by conditioning healthy monocytes with GBM-derived EVs. Further, knockdown of TIGIT expression reduced the immunosuppressive polarization of monocytes, resulting in improvement in T cell function. This finding proceeded in an NLRP3-dependent manner, with substantial co-localization of TIGIT and NLRP3 expression prior to knockdown. These findings point to a novel role for TIGIT expression in diverse myeloid cells in the GBM microenvironment as a marker of immunosuppressive activity and further indicate a hierarchy of immunomodulatory protein activity in these myeloid cells, with TIGIT knockdown unmasking the pro-inflammatory activity of NLRP3. This study bolsters understanding of the immunosuppressive complexities of myeloid cells in the GBM microenvironment, while lending further support to prevention or attenuation of immunosuppressive myeloid cell activity as a means of restoring immune function in GBM.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/648993v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1592b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@52bc9borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc8e56org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@104cbba_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Graphical abstract (Created in BioRender.

This study uncovers a novel immunosuppressive axis involving TIGIT expression in myeloid cells, which are key players in the GBM tumor microenvironment. By demonstrating GBM-derived extracellular vesicles induce TIGIT in healthy monocytes and TIGIT knockdown diminishes immunosuppressive polarization via an NLRP3-dependent pathway, the study highlights TIGIT as both a marker and modulator of immune dysfunction in GBM. These findings introduce a functional hierarchy of immunoregulatory proteins in tumor-associated myeloid cells, positioning TIGIT as a potential checkpoint target. Restoring immune activity by disrupting this axis could enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in GBM. Thus, this research not only advances our understanding of tumor-induced immune suppression but also opens a promising therapeutic avenue to reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity in a cancer type historically resistant to immunotherapeutic approaches.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Fine mapping of a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) was performed as a first step to isolate the causal gene. Natural variation of FLL and FLW across multi-environment was highly heritable and genotypes adapted to warm climate produced longer and wider flag leaf than those adapted to cooler regions. The variation in flag leaf size was quantitatively inherited and influenced by 24 consensus QTLs of which 17 have not been reported earlier. Further, validation of QTL qHvDRR-FLS-8 and qHvDRR-FLS-17 in nearly isogenic RILs demonstrated that these QTLs also controlled length and width of leaves older than flag leaf. The number of epidermal cells primarily determined the differences in FLL and FLW. In addition, we identified the previously unknown effect of genic- and epiallele at Vrn-H1 on flag leaf size variation in spring barley. Furthermore, we fine-mapped qHvDRR-FLS-8, narrowing the interval from 8.7 to 3.5 Mb.

Signalling by the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) is essential to regulate sex steroids production in gonads, but how G protein-dependent signals from endosomes are functionally important for steroidogenesis remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that transient LHR activation promotes a prolonged Gs/cAMP signalling from endosomes, which requires ligand-induced independent receptor and Gs trafficking.

Unlike the fatal phenotype following homozygous Becn1 deletion, the heterozygous mice were grossly normal, though they presented with significantly shorter small intestines. Gastrointestinal organoids derived from the mice also displayed disrupted endocytic trafficking and altered cytoskeletal dynamics resulting in mislocalisation of junctional proteins such as E-CADHERIN.

Investigation of BECLIN1 levels in biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) revealed changes in its expression across distinct states of inflammation with reduced levels observed in highly inflamed regions in some patients, consistent with the gastrointestinal defects seen in mice with reduced BECLIN1.

Softer substrates enhanced filopodia activity and altered migration behavior. On softer ECMs, talin1 displayed a more even intracellular distribution, whereas on stiffer matrices it localized to the cell periphery. PA gels supported elongated talin1-based adhesions, whose morphology showed minimal variation across the 3-188 kPa stiffness range.

However, despite its conservation, actin in many ascomycete fungi fails to bind phalloidin. Here we trace the failure to bind phalloidin to a single amino acid change in a phalloidin-binding residue in actin. Reverting this change in the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans by introducing the point mutation act1V75I at the native ACT1 locus confers phalloidin binding without disrupting actin function. We describe a simple genetic technique to introduce this point mutation that may be effective in other fungal systems.

D.", "abstract": "Centromeres are essential chromosomal components that ensure proper cell division by serving as assembly sites for kinetochores, which connect chromosomes to spindle microtubules. Centromeres are marked by the evolutionarily conserved centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A, which is deposited into centromere nucleosomes during G1 in human cells. Centromeres retain cohesin, a ring-like protein complex during mitosis, protecting sister chromatid cohesion and centromere transcription to prevent chromosome missegregation. Previous work in Drosophila has suggested that centromere transcription and centromeric RNAs are important for CENP-A deposition in chromatin. During mitosis centromeric cohesin is critical for centromere transcription. However, it is not clear how or if centromeric transcription and cohesin contribute to CENP-A deposition in G1 in human cells. To address these questions, we combined a cell synchronization strategy with the Auxin Inducible Degron technology and transcription inhibition in human cells. In contrast to Drosophila cells, our results demonstrated that neither centromeric transcription nor cohesin is required for CENP-A deposition in human cells. Our data demonstrate clear differences in the CENP-A deposition mechanism between human and Drosophila cells. These findings provide deeper insights into the plasticity underlying centromere maintenance and highlight evolutionary divergence in centromere maintenance systems across species.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

While CAR activation has been previously linked to higher ploidy, the underlying mechanisms are not fully known. Here, we uncover a basal role for CAR in maintaining hepatocyte ploidy, such that CAR deletion increases the number of diploid (2c) hepatocytes with a concomitant reduction in tetraploid (4c) hepatocytes. We demonstrate that CAR controls the de novo dNTP synthesis by directly transactivating the Ribonucleotide reductase-M2 (RRM2) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting catalytic subunit of the enzyme, ribonucleotide reductase. Further, we find that the ligand-dependent CAR activation is sufficient to induce several genes involved in the de novo dNTP synthesis pathways, resulting in higher hepatic dATP and dTTP levels within the liver. Importantly, overexpressing RRM2 levels in CAR knockouts led to increased DNA synthesis and tetraploid (4c) hepatocytes compared to the control mice. Taken together, these findings reveal that the CAR-mediated RRM2 regulation contributes towards DNA synthesis and thereby maintains hepatocyte ploidy.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Depletion of DOT1L induces the expression of transposable elements and subsequent type I interferon (IFN) response, and meanwhile lowers ZEB1 levels to further unleash the expression of immune-related genes. In turn, we demonstrate that DOT1L loss or treatment with the clinical stage inhibitor EPZ-5676 sensitizes tumors to ICB with increased immune infiltration in mice.

Skin is the largest epithelial barrier and the source of cutaneous cancers, the deadliest of which are cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs). Despite the pervasiveness of these cancers, however, the molecular mechanisms employed by stem cells and their microenvironment to promote skin tumor development remain poorly defined. Our previous work revealed that genotoxic damage to normal skin activates inflammasome signaling crosstalk between epidermal epithelia and fibroblasts to promote epithelial stem cell hyperproliferation and fate misspecification. We hypothesized that these phenomena would also be featured during skin cancer development. Using mouse and human skin disease specimens, we determined that in vivo stem cell misspecification is a generalizable feature across diverse pathophysiological skin conditions, including cutaneous cancers, but is not present in normal high proliferative contexts. Strikingly, in vivo inflammasome activation was observed in both the epithelial and dermal compartments of cSCC tumors but was not evident in other skin pathologies. Probing further into the mechanism, we revealed that inflammasome pathway activation in cSCC is epithelial autonomous but non-cell autonomous. Furthermore, fibroblasts juxtaposed to the cSCC epithelial tumor interface exhibited population expansion as well as IL-1 signaling activation, which was absent in overlying epithelia. Based on these findings, we propose a model whereby epithelial-to-fibroblast inflammasome crosstalk initiates a fibroblast feed-forward IL-1 signaling loop that augments the tumor-promoting cSCC milieu.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate whether Meis1 and Meis2 overexpression in postnatal mouse RPCs can alter temporal identity and induce early-born cell types. Using electroporation and single-cell RNA sequencing, we find that while these factors modestly upregulate early-stage gene regulatory network components, they do not repress late-stage transcription factors or induce early-born retinal cells.

Among vertebrates, mammalian haploid embryos are particularly prone to arrest during early preimplantation stages for reasons that remain unclear. Here, using mouse embryos with varying cell sizes and genome ploidy, we show that developmental arrest is primarily caused not by haploidy itself but an imbalance between genome ploidy and cytoplasmic volume. Haploid embryos exhibit cytokinesis failure, frequently accompanied by chromosome segregation failure due to malformed spindles beginning at the second mitosis, with about half of the affected blastomeres subsequently arresting before the morula stage. Strikingly, restoring the DNA-to-cytoplasm (D/C) ratio by halving the cytoplasmic volume alleviates these defects. Similarly, diploid embryos with doubled cytoplasmic volume show mitotic and developmental abnormalities resembling those of haploid embryos, whereas tetraploid embryos with the same volume develop normally. These findings demonstrate that a proper D/C ratio, rather than genome ploidy, is critical for mouse embryos to reach the morula stage. Moreover, halving the D/C ratio at later developmental stages, such as the late G2 phase of the 1-cell stage or during the 2-cell stage, progressively improves developmental outcomes. When the D/C ratio is reduced at the end of the 2-cell stage, development proceeds normally. Our findings identify a critical temporal window during which a balanced D/C ratio is essential for mitotic fidelity and successful preimplantation development.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Condensin contains a binding interface between its Ycg1 (HEAT-repeat) and Brn1 (kleisin) subunits that acts like a \"safety belt\" to trap DNA and prevent its dissociation during loop extrusion. The entrapment of DNA within the binding pocket of the SMC complex is crucial for ATPase activity and the asymmetric loop extrusion. However, the molecular mechanism underlying DNA entrapment remains unclear, hindering our understanding of how condensin functions at a molecular level. Here, we employ multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to reveal how DNA actively modulates condensin's safety-belt dynamics. Using all-atom simulations combined with AlphaFold3 predictions, we demonstrate that DNA binding markedly stabilizes the condensin safety belt, facilitating loop extrusion progression. Coarse-grained simulations capture the entire DNA entrapment process, highlighting an active regulatory role of DNA: DNA positioned outside the safety belt triggers its opening, whereas DNA within promotes closure, enhancing complex stability. Kinetic analyses further reveal that the rate-limiting step in DNA entrapment depends critically on the tightness of the safety belt. A loose safety belt makes the stable closure of its \"latch\" and \"buckle\" components rate-limiting, whereas a tighter safety belt shifts the barrier to initial DNA entry. Additionally, we find that latch-buckle interaction strength regulates condensin's sliding motion along DNA.

However, how distinct phosphorylation patterns shape {beta}-arrestin structure and function remains poorly understood. Here, we combine all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with machine learning and graph neural networks to systematically map the barcode-dependent conformational landscapes of {beta}-arrestins bound to the phosphorylated vasopressin receptor 2 tail (V2Rpp).

Furthermore, we identify critical residue networks that transmit phosphorylation signals to effector-binding interfaces in a barcode- and isoform-specific manner.

These muscles attach to the thoracic walls in an indirect flight muscle (IFM) configuration, generating thoracic deformations that drive wing flapping, while smaller steering muscles adjust wing kinematics stroke-by-stroke. The wings articulate with the thorax via the wing hinge, in which the radial stop (RS) and a grooved pleural wing process (PWP) interact to form a mechanical gearbox system, proposed to modulate wingbeat amplitude during maneuvering. Supporting this gearbox hypothesis, previous studies observed close RS-PWP interactions during fictive turns in tethered flies. An alternative, though not exclusive, hypothesis suggests that steering muscles govern wingbeat amplitude modulation. However, the gearbox hypothesis had not been rigorously tested in freely flying insects. Here, we first assessed the morphological diversity of the RS-PWP-Pterale C complex across Diptera using scanning electron microscopy and found substantial variation, particularly in PWP morphology. We next tested gearbox function by bilaterally ablating the PWP in freely flying houseflies (Musca domestica), which were released into an L-shaped arena requiring 90 degree yaw turns. Kinematic analyses revealed no significant differences between control and PWP-ablated flies across various wing and body parameters during yaw turns. Both groups could differentially modulate wingbeat amplitude during turns, a key mechanism for yaw torque generation. These findings indicate that the PWP is not essential for wingbeat amplitude modulation, and suggest that steering muscles may primarily control amplitude control during manuevers.

Cognitive theories assume that overlap of task representations may lead to between-task crosstalk in concurrent task processing and thus requires cognitive control. Recent research suggests that modality-based crosstalk contributes to multitasking costs, involving central overlap of modality-specific representations. Consistently increased costs for specific modality pairings (visual-vocal and auditory-manual vs. visual-manual and auditory-vocal) were demonstrated (modality-compatibility effect), which were recently linked to representational overlap in the auditory cortex. However, it remains unclear whether modality-based crosstalk emerges from overlapping patterns of global brain connectivity and whether resolving it requires additional involvement of cognitive control as reflected in the fronto-parietal control network. This preregistered functional imaging study investigates these questions in 64 healthy, young human adults. Specifically, we focus on the modality-compatibility effect in multitasking by employing functional connectivity (FC) analysis. First, we tested the FC similarity between the single-task networks. Second, we compared the strength of the control network in whole-brain FC between dual tasks. We found no evidence for different FC similarities of single-task networks between modality pairings and no additional involvement of the control network during dual tasks. However, post-hoc connectivity analysis revealed a brain-behavior correlation for the modality-compatibility effect in dual tasks. This effect was locally restricted to FC between lateral frontal and sensory auditory regions, providing evidence for the modality-based crosstalk theory.

In two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments (N = 22, N = 21), participants made perceptual decisions about two pulses of motion evidence separated by gaps of varying duration. Our goal was to investigate 1) whether and how people integrate the two pulses across various delay durations, and 2) how a prominent EEG marker of evidence accumulation, the centroparietal positivity (CPP), reflects decisions in the context of our intermittent-pulses task. Our results are consistent with a bounded evidence accumulation process where the second pulse further informs the decision only if the bound is not reached by the first pulse. We show that whereas motor preparation signals reflected in motor beta lateralisation (MBL) maintain the cumulative evidence level reached from pulse 1 through the gap, the CPP does not sustain but rather exhibits transient deflections following each pulse, encoding momentary belief updates.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Olshansky and collaborators have recently proposed that the era of continuous extension of human lifespans has finally come to an end. By analysing thirty years of recent demographic data (1990-2020) from ten populations (the eight longest-lived nations, plus Hong Kong and the USA), they rejected the claims made by Oeppen and Vaupel at the start of the century (and more recently by Vaupel and collaborators) that human longevity was still far from approaching an upper limit. However, on closer examination the results by Olshansky and colleagues seem to complement rather than directly challenge the radical life extension hypothesis. The reason is that the latter was based not on country-level demographic patterns but instead on a best-practice life expectancy trend resulting from the succession of annual world-leading populations. Here we present an update based on data from the last two decades that confirms Oeppen and Vaupels original insights and demonstrates that both female and male lifespans continue to linearly increase at a global scale. This remarkably long trend observed since 1840 remains at odds with our expectation that human lifespans must at some point hit a biologically imposed ceiling.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Numerous studies have highlighted how the dynamics of this kinase dictate whether cells survive in response to cellular stress or induce cell death mechanisms. However, it is less clear how these dynamics potentially contribute to downstream gene expression patterns through regulated transcription factors like c-Jun. To investigate this question, we used a treatment strategy with the JNK agonist anisomycin to drive specific dynamics; sustained, transient, or pulsed activation, and assessed the impact on downstream gene expression patterns. We observed that multiple gene expression patterns emerged depending on the dynamics of JNK activation. Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models suggest that a subset of these clusters are mediated by mRNA stability and supported by measured mRNA decay rates. Specific gene clusters also show enrichment in specific cellular pathways, including cell death and inflammatory signaling, suggesting these dynamics contribute to differential regulation of these pathways. These findings highlight another contribution of JNK dynamics to the regulation of cellular responses to stress stimuli.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Mechanistically, we find that heteroplasmic cells accumulate complex I subunits of the electron transport chain in the cytoplasm, which severely disrupts ATP production and leads to premature termination of osteoclastogenesis. Importantly, we show that stimulating autophagy and improving mitochondrial quality using spermidine alleviates the dysfunction in both the murine heteroplasmic model and in human heteroplasmic osteoclasts carrying m.3242A>G mutations, partially through enhanced mitochondrial selection.

Here, we aimed to interrogate the mechanisms and the specific cellular compartment contributing to DIAR9 using a human intestinal organoid model. Methods: Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) generated from both a patient-derived WNT2BR69*iPSC line and a control line were transplanted into immunocompromised mice for 10 weeks. Grafts were harvested and histologically compared. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on both organoid groups and on patient-biopsy derived enteroids. In vitro recombination experiments were performed to describe the causative cellular compartment. Results: Live and histological imaging revealed partial epithelial delamination in WNT2BR69*HIOs, which was absent in controls. A significant number of crypts in WNT2BR69* HIOs lacked OLFM4, a surrogate marker of stem cell activity. Key transcriptomic pathways altered between groups included trafficking of apical digestion proteins, which was confirmed via immunofluorescence. Patient derived enteroid proteomic analysis revealed similar results. Recombination experiments in HIOs revealed that while both epithelial and mesenchymal WNT2B are important for stem cell function, lack of mesenchymal WNT2B was sufficient to elicit the phenotype.

The role of niche signals in driving these processes remains poorly understood. Using the Drosophila testis, we identify a regulatory axis in which age-related decline of niche signals (BMPs) lead to upregulation of the co-repressor Hairless, which downregulates the RNA-binding protein Imp in aged germline stem cells (GSCs). Reduced Imp causes loss of Chinmo, a key factor in GSC aging and competition. Reduced Chinmo causes ectopic Perlecan secretion which accumulates in the testis lumen and causes GSC loss. Aging of the testis is reversed by increasing BMPs in the niche, or by overexpressing Imp or depleting Hairless in GSCs. Furthermore, GSC clones with reduced Imp or increased Hairless are more competitive, expelling wild-type neighbors and monopolizing the niche. Thus, BMPs regulate testicular niche aging through the Hairless/Imp/Chinmo axis and winning GSCs usurp these aging mechanisms.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Inflammatory processes can disrupt the brain's reward circuitry, particularly the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is central to dopamine-mediated motivation and reward. This study investigates whether MRI-derived markers sensitive to neuroinflammation and microstructure in the VTA are associated with depression diagnosis and symptom severity. Methods: We analyzed diffusion weighted imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping data from 32,495 UK Biobank participants, including 3,807 individuals with ICD-10 diagnosed depression. Metrics sensitive to neuroinflammation (free water [FW], isotropic volume fraction [ISOVF], magnetic susceptibility) and microstructure (intracellular volume fraction [ICVF], orientation dispersion index [ODI] volume) were extracted from the VTA. Group differences between the major depression group and BMI, sex, and age-matched healthy controls were assessed using ANOVAs and linear regression was used to predict acute symptom severity based on Recent Depressive Symptoms scores. Results: Participants with depression diagnosis had significantly higher FW ({rho} < 0.001) and ISOVF ({rho} = 0.001) compared to HCs, indicating increased extracellular processes such as inflammation in the VTA. Lower ISOVF ({beta} = -0.46, {rho} = 0.017) and higher ICVF ({beta} = 0.34, {rho} = 0.007) and ODI ({beta} = 0.49, {rho} = 0.004) were associated with higher depression severity, independent of depressive diagnosis history.

Following mice immunization at three time points of 2-week intervals, adjuvanted-OvMANE1 exhibited a promising safety profile, revealing neither any physical signs of toxicity nor behavioural abnormalities. Immunological assays showed significant increases in total IgG levels after the first (p = 0.0260) and final booster doses (p = 0.026). Interestingly, total IgG (p = 0.0086) and IgG1 (p = 0.0465) levels also increased significantly over the study period highlighting the ability of OvMANE1 to sustain humoral immunity. Moreover, cellular responses were significantly enhanced, with elevated leukocyte count (p = 0.0190) and increased lymphocyte activity (p = 0.0397) observed in the adjuvanted-OvMANE1 group compared to the control.

Although a limited set of studies suggest that neuronal peptides impact vertebrate heart growth, the specific contributions of these peptides to cardiomyocyte progenitor differentiation or proliferation have not been elucidated. Here we show that the neuropeptide tachykinin along with canonical Wnt signaling regulate cardiomyocyte progenitor proliferation in the chordate model Ciona robusta. In C. robusta, the heart continues to grow throughout adulthood and classic histological studies indicate that a line of undifferentiated cells may serve as a reserve progenitor lineage. We found that this line of cardiomyocyte progenitors consists of distinct distal and midline populations. Distal progenitors divide asymmetrically to produce distal and midline daughters. Midline progenitors divide asymmetrically to produce myocardial precursors. Through single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of adult C. robusta hearts, we delineated the cardiomyocyte progenitor expression profile. Based on this data we investigated the role of Wnt signaling in cardiomyocyte progenitor proliferation and found that canonical Wnt signaling is required to suppress excessive progenitor proliferation. The scRNA-seq data also identified a number of presumptive cardiac neural-like cells. Strikingly, we found that a subset of these neuronal cells appears to innervate the distal cardiomyocyte progenitors. Based on the expression of the tachykinin receptor in these neuronal cells, we blocked tachykinin signaling using pharmacological inhibitors and found that this drove reduced proliferation in the distal progenitor pool. Through targeted CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown we then demonstrated that both extrinsic tachykinin and intrinsic, cardiac tachykinin receptors are required for formation of the myocardial heart tube.

Recently, stem cell-like CRPC (CRPC-SCL) has been defined as a specific class of CRPC characterized by the absence of AR expression, dependency on YAP/TAZ activity, and mesenchymal features. Here, we showed that YAP depletion in cellular models of CRPC-SCL leads to the downregulation of genes involved in EMT, including N-methylnicotinamide transferase (NNMT), which controls NAD synthesis and cellular energetics, competing with nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) for nicotinamide. We identified NNMT as a marker of a human CRPC-SCL, while transcriptomics analysis of a murine-derived prostate cancer stem cell-like (DVL3-SCM) unraveled a strong upregulation of NNMT transcripts in respect to the parental counterpart (DVL3-PAR) along with an increased mesenchymal phenotype and aggressiveness in vivo.

Here, we reported that in low-pass sequencing data, somatic variant signatures in cfDNA markedly differ between non-cancerous controls and cancer patients, indicating that tumor-associated signals are retained in these variants.

Different conditions require different rates and directions of movement. For the microbial predator Capsaspora owczarzaki, its motility is likely essential for predation. This organism has been shown to prey on diverse organisms, including the schistosome parasites that co-reside with it in Biomphalaria glabrata snails. Capsaspora is also an evolutionary model for the unicellular ancestor of animals. This phylogenic placement makes Capsaspora's motility an attractive target for understanding the evolution of motility in animal cells. Until now, little was known of how Capsaspora regulates it rate and direction of motility. Here we found that it exhibits chemokinesis (increased movement in response to chemical factors) in response to proteins released from prey cells. Chemokinesis also occurs in response to pure proteins--including bovine serum albumin. We found that this chemokinesis behavior is dependent on Capsaspora cell density, which suggests that the regulated motility is a cooperative behavior (possibly to improve cooperative feeding). We developed a mathematical model of Capsaspora motility and found that chemokinesis alone does not benefit Capsaspora predation. However, when coupled with chemotaxis (directional motility along a chemical gradient toward prey), chemokinesis may improve predation. Finally, we quantitatively analyzed Capsaspora's previously reported chemotaxis behavior. These findings lay a foundation for characterizing the mechanisms of regulated motility in a predator of a human pathogen and a model for the ancestor of animals.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

The LmGAPDH binding with the AU-rich elements in 3'-untranslated region of TNF-alpha mRNA (TNF-alpha ARE) is sufficient for limiting this cytokine production, but the TNF-alpha ARE binding residues in LmGAPDH are still unexplored. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA) and catalytic activity measurement revealed that the inhibition by TNF-alpha ARE was competitive with respect to cofactor NAD+ in LmGAPDH. To identify the TNF-alpha ARE binding residues of the LmGAPDH, we exploited a systematic mutational analysis of its NAD+ binding domain. Catalytic activity measurement indicates that both R13 and N336 amino acids in the NAD+ binding site are absolutely required for activity whereas other mutants including I14A, R16A, D39A and T112A showed higher Km (lower affinity) value for NAD+ binding and lower catalytic activity. REMSA studies revealed that the replacement of Arg-13 with Ala/Lys or Asn-336 with Ala resulted in complete loss of binding with the TNF-alpha ARE. I14A, R16A, D39A and T112A residues at or near NAD+ binding site showed lower binding with the TNF-alpha ARE compared to the wild-type protein. The protein induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) studies and in vitro protein translation assay further confirmed the REMSA results. Based on our findings, the NAD+ binding residues in LmGAPDH are important for TNF-alpha ARE binding.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we used unbiased quantitative protein mass spectrometry to assess the cellular response profile to drug perturbations in ovarian cancer cells for the rational design of potential combination therapies. Analysis of the perturbation profiles revealed proteins responding across several drug perturbations (called frequently responsive below) as well as drug-specific protein responses. The frequently responsive proteins included proteins that reflected general drug resistance mechanisms such as changes in drug efflux pumps. Network analysis of drug-specific protein responses revealed known and potential novel markers of resistance, which were used to rationalize the design of anti-resistance drug pairs. We experimentally tested the anti-proliferative effects of 12 of the proposed drug combinations in 6 HGSOC cell lines. Drug combinations tested with additive or synergistic effects are plausible candidates for overcoming or preventing resistance to single agents; these include several combinations that were synergistic (with PARPi, MEKi, and SRCi). Additionally, we observed 0.05-0.11 micromolar response to GPX4 inhibitors as single agents in the OVCAR-4 cell line.

Neu1 deficiency in human AD brains and 5xFAD/Neu1-/- mice leads to sialic acid retention on APP and its secretases, enhancing amyloidogenic cleavage and A{beta}42 production.

While CAP-PTM interactions have been extensively studied using histone peptides, this cannot consider the regulatory potential of multi-site binding on intact nucleosomes. To overcome this limitation, we applied Nucleosome Mass Spectrometry (Nuc-MS), a native Top-Down MS approach that enables controlled disassembly of intact CAP:nucleosome (CAP:nuc) complexes to provide a direct readout of the contained histone proteoforms. As proof of principle, we show the BPTF PHD-BD native tandem reader requires coincident H3K4me3K9acK14acK18ac for effective nucleosome engagement. We extend our approach to explore how the BRD4 (native BD1-BD2), DNMT3A-MPP8 (chimeric PWWP-CD), and PtSHL (native BAH-BD) tandem readers interact with endogenous nucleosomes. Each reveals distinct enrichment profiles: BRD4 favoring di- and tri-acetylated histone H4 proteoforms, whereas DNMT3A-MPP8 and PtSHL preferentially interact with hypermethylated H3 proteoforms. Of note the latter enriches combinatorial {H3K4me3K27me3} on the same histone tail in HeLa chromatin, and thus expands the potential biology of this widely studied bivalent signature. By directly characterizing CAP:nuc complex composition with combinatorial PTM information in a single readout, Nuc-MS serves as a new approach to discover the modifications driving binding, and therefore primary candidates to explore for structural biology and genomic studies.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Deletion of 26 residues profoundly impaired PVY cell-to-cell movement and prevented systemic PVY spread, while deletions of 19-23 residues allowed delayed systemic PVY spread.

While multiplexed single-molecule assays can address these issues, suitable functionalization of surfaces is required, which remains a technical challenge -- many commonly used approaches are constrained by random and sparse biomolecules arrangements, limiting programmability and throughput. An ideal anchoring method would enable (i) high surface densities to maximize throughput, (ii) precise control of spatial position and molecular identity for maximum control, (iii) covalent linking for high force application, and (iv) efficient patterning without the need for expensive facilities to maximize accessibility. To achieve these aims, we have developed a light-guided surface patterning method that can covalently organize oligonucleotides (oligos) without the need for lithographic equipment. Oligos with 3-Cyanovinylcarbazole (CNVK) nucleoside are crosslinked by UV patterns reflected through a digital micromirror device (DMD), with beads arranged accordingly. To demonstrate compatibility with established single-molecule methods, we performed single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments on patterned coverslips, using both magnetic tweezers and hydrodynamic-based systems.

Copper is thought to form a bridge between these two domains, inhibiting the protein's inherent neurotoxicity. However, the molecular details of how copper interacts with the C-terminal regulatory surface are unclear. To assess the potential role of conserved C-terminal His residues in copper coordination, we applied sortase-mediated ligation to create an expressed, murine prion protein with segmental 15N-labeling of the N-terminal domain. Pulsed EPR methods applied to a 1:1 protein:copper complex revealed both 14N and 15N couplings, consistent with simultaneous coordination of the two protein domains to the copper center. Mutagenesis studies localized C-terminal copper coordination to His176, present on the second alpha-helix. The cumulative EPR results reveal a copper coordination environment composed of three His residues from the protein's N-terminal domain, along with His176. The feasibility of these findings was tested with AlphaFold 3 simulations. These results further refine the molecular details of the prion protein autoregulation, emphasizing the critical role of its copper cofactor.

Due to the presence of mixed populations of fibrillar proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases in brain tissue, high-resolution structures of Asyn fibrils are essential for the design of high-specificity imaging and therapeutic agents. Approximately one hundred high-resolution solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Asyn fibrils have been deposited to the Protein Databank (PDB); intriguingly there is significant polymorphism among them. Understanding the molecular makeup and characteristic features of each structural polymorph can determine conserved structural motifs which can be used as templates to design ligands with high specificity for clinical use. Utilizing standard alignment tools and density-based clustering approaches, we objectively classify fibril structures by tertiary structure type. We find that 81% of the structures cluster into two polymorph classes. Within each class, additional subtle variations are observed which position sidechains in specific, conserved orientations, well poised as druggable targets. Furthermore, we find that the conserved structural motifs associated with each class are found in all but one published Asyn fibril structure. We consider these classifications and conserved motifs in the context of disease-relevant fibril structures and offer a perspective on the utility of in vitro fibrils as substrates for drug development and models for disease pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

A growing body of evidence highlights the critical role of epistasis, the dependence of mutational effects on the sequence context, in shaping the fitness landscape of HIV under ART-induced selection pressure. However, the biophysical origins of the epistatic interactions involved in engendering drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) remain unclear. Are the mutational correlations intrinsic to the properties of the protein, or do they arise because of drug binding? We use a Potts sequence-covariation statistical energy model built on patient-derived HIV-1 protein sequences to construct computational double mutant cycles that probe pairwise epistasis for all observed mutations across the three major HIV drug-target enzymes. We find that the strongest epistatic effects occur between mutations at residue positions that frequently mutate during the course of ART, termed resistance-associated positions. To investigate the structural origins of the strongest epistatic interactions, we perform ~100 free energy perturbation molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that the primary contribution to the pairwise epistasis between DRMs arises from cooperative effects on protein stability and folding as an intrinsic consequence of the protein mutational landscape.

Genomic exploration continually reveals novel microbial lineages, often exhibiting extreme genome reduction, particularly within symbiotic relationships. Here, we report the discovery of Candidatus Sukunaarchaeum mirabile, a novel archaeon with an unprecedentedly small genome of only 238 kbp --less than half the size of the smallest previously known archaeal genome-- from a dinoflagellate-associated microbial community. Phylogenetic analyses place Sukunaarchaeum as a deeply branching lineage within the tree of Archaea, representing a novel major branch distinct from established phyla. Environmental sequence data indicate that sequences closely related to Sukunaarchaeum form a diverse and previously overlooked clade in microbial surveys. Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation. This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses. The discovery of Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life and highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions, suggesting that further exploration of symbiotic systems may reveal even more extraordinary life forms, reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Due to restricted tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses for mouse cells, model systems of infection rely on transgenic expression of the entry receptor human ACE2 (hACE2). Available hACE2 transgenic models using the Krt18 promotor express the receptor across multiple cell types and organ systems, leading to multiple disease features including pneumonia, vascular compromise and neuro-inflammation, that reflect the multi-organ nature of COVID-19. To disentangle the role of cell tropism in driving the clinical manifestations of the disease, we generated two new transgenic mouse models, Sftpa1-hACE2 and Cdh5-hACE2 transgenic mice, with hACE2 restricted to lung epithelium or endothelial cells respectively. In Sftpa1-hACE2 mice, with high expression of the hACE2 receptor in lung alveolar type 2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection led to rapidly progressing disease, characterised by a strong neutrophilic innate immune response in the lung, followed by viral neuro-invasion and early death. Krt18-hACE2 mice additionally recruited various dendritic cell subsets and gradually developed adaptive immunity. In Cdh5-hACE2 Tg mice with exclusive endothelial tropism of the virus, viral inoculation via the lung or systemic circulation did not lead to viral propagation or disease manifestations, despite endothelial expression of hACE2 in the lung. These results suggest that tropism for alveolar epithelial cells increases disease severity, while endothelial cell tropism per se does not drive the vascular consequences often seen in COVID-19 patients. Our new transgenic mouse models will be helpful to dissect how cell tropism contributes to the clinical manifestations of coronavirus infection.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

To overcome this limitation, here we investigate substrate co-metabolism in the acetogen Eubacterium limosum, cofeeding either carbon monoxide (CO) or glucose alongside the primary C1 substrate (methanol or formate). To increase experimental throughput, we developed AneVO, a parallel mini bioreactor system based on eVOLVER that enables benchtop anaerobic batch and fed-batch cultivation, along with continuous delivery of anaerobic gas blends. With all substrate pairs tested, E. limosum grew faster and reached 52-254% higher cell densities with cofeeding, while maintaining or improving the volumetric uptake rate of the main C1 substrate.

Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N) is an essential parameter known to influence both the function and the activity of microbial communities in bioprocesses. The right balance between the contribution of each of these resources are essential for sustainable and cost-efficiency bioprocess. Here we aimed to assess the influence of C/N (here methanol and nitrate) on the performance of a recirculating denitrifying reactor for 31 weeks under marine conditions. We also monitored the evolution of its microbial community during the operating conditions. Methodology. A 500-mL methanol-fed recirculating denitrification reactor operated under marine conditions and colonized by a naturally occurring multispecies denitrifying biofilm was subjected to eight different C/N over 31 weeks under anoxic conditions. We monitored several physico-chemical parameters (denitrifying activities, methanol consumption, CO2 production) throughout the operating conditions. Evolution of the bacterial community in the biofilm during the operating conditions was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Metatranscriptomes of representative conditions were performed to derive (1) the relative gene expression profiles of Methylophaga nitratireducenticrescens strain GP59, the main denitrifier, and (2) the functional diversity of the biofilm. Results. Changes in C/N did not impact the denitrifying activities of the recirculating reactor but did impact the carbon dynamics. Throughout the operating time, nitrite and N2O appeared transiently, and ammonium was not observed. The bacterial community in the reactor increased in diversity as the biofilm aged, especially in heterotrophic bacteria, at the expense of methylotrophic bacteria. The functional diversity suggests that heterotrophs could use formaldehyde, which may have been released by methylotrophs in the biofilm, as energy and carbon source. The relative expression profiles of strain GP59 in the biofilm is distinct of those of GP59 planktonic pure cultures, and that the expression of several riboswitches and xoxF would be involved in such differences. Conclusions. When the biofilm community is well established in the reactor, it can sustain changes in C/N with limited impact on the denitrification performance. Increase in the proportion of heterotrophs would allow the reactor to be more flexible for carbon sources. Such knowledge can be useful in the optimisation of denitrification process.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

A key driver of this panzootic is the apparent high viral fitness across diverse avian species, which facilitates an increased interface between wild and domestic species. Columbiformes (pigeons and doves) are commonly found on poultry premises and are highly connected to humans in urban settlements, yet relatively little is known about their potential role in contemporary HPAIV disease ecology. Here we investigated the epidemiological role of pigeons (Columba livia) by determining their susceptibility using decreasing doses of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV (genotype AB). We investigated infection outcomes and transmission potential between pigeons and to chickens for each dose. Following direct inoculation, pigeons did not develop clinical signs, and only those inoculated with the highest dose shed viral RNA or seroconverted to H5N1-AB, revealing a MID50 of 10^5 EID50. Even in the high dose group, only low-level shedding and environmental contamination was observed, and low-level viral RNA were present in the tissues of directly inoculated pigeons, with no distinct pathological lesions. Pigeons did not transmit the virus to naive pigeons or chickens placed in direct contact. Overall, these findings suggest that pigeons have a low susceptibility to clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV and are less likely to significantly contribute to disease ecology, incursions into poultry, or pose a significant zoonotic threat.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

While there are currently no approved HEV-specific therapeutics, ribavirin and pegylated interferon, prescribed off-label, are the current standard of care. However, ribavirin resistance and toxicity highlight the unmet clinical need to identify safer, HEV-specific antivirals. Auranofin, an FDA-approved anti-rheumatic drug, displays antiviral activity against several viruses. Therefore, we investigated auranofin's potential as an antiviral and its mechanism of action against HEV. We demonstrated that auranofin displays dose-dependent antiviral activity against two genotypes of HEV that cause a significant proportion of human disease, as well as against a ribavirin treatment failure-associated mutant. Because auranofin is known to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), we investigated the antiviral mechanism of action via treatment with ROS inhibitors. ROS inhibitors reversed auranofin-mediated ROS promotion and antiviral activity, suggesting the observed antiviral effects are mediated by ROS. Furthermore, treatment with a different ROS promotor, D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), also displays antiviral activity against HEV, which was also reversed by treatment with a ROS inhibitor, suggesting that ROS accumulation alone is antiviral. We also demonstrated that combined treatment with auranofin and ribavirin exhibits synergistic antiviral activity in vitro, which supports repurposing auranofin as an antiviral against HEV, potentially in combination with ribavirin. Overall, this study has important implications in repurposing auranofin as an antiviral against HEV and in delineating the mechanism of action against HEV via ROS.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Dung beetles commonly rely on herbivore dung as their main source of nutrition, a diet rich in recalcitrant, hard-to-digest plant polysaccharides yet poor in essential amino acids, which animals typically cannot synthesize on their own. The work presented here investigates the potential role of the host-associated microbial community in allowing these insects to thrive on their nutrient-poor diet. Specifically, we investigated if the microbiota of the bull-headed dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus, may be capable of synthesizing amino acids and breaking down complex plant polysaccharides. To do so we functionally annotated genes within metagenomically assembled genomes (MAGs) obtained via shotgun-metagenomic sequencing. The annotation of these MAGs revealed that bacteria found in association with O. taurus possess the metabolic potential necessary to bridge the gap between host metabolic needs and the limitations imposed by their diet. Specifically, O. taurus microbiota contain amino acid biosynthesis pathways and genes encoding cellulases and xylanases, both of which are absent in the beetle genome. Further, multiple functionally relevant bacterial taxa identified here have also been observed in other studies across diverse dung beetle species, possibly suggesting a conserved pool of dung beetle symbionts and metabolic functions.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

They are a key epidemiological quantity because, together with the reproduction number R, they determine the population-level growth rate of a pathogen and its doubling time. Conversely, when fitting epidemiological models to data, assumed generation intervals impact R inference. This is well-known from studies that have used case data for R inference, with many studies emphasizing the importance of choosing an accurate distribution for the generation interval. In phylodynamic inference of R, the generation interval distribution is often not explicitly mentioned, and the impact of generation interval misspecification has been studied less. Here, we explore the impact of a commonly assumed (but rarely empirically accurate) exponential generation interval distribution on the estimation of R in phylodynamic inference. Using simulations and inference on these simulated datasets, we find that during the early exponential growth of an epidemic, if the generation interval is assumed to be exponentially distributed when it actually has a lower variance, then estimates of R will be biased low. Furthermore, uncertainty in the biased R estimates will be small. Our work highlights the importance of acknowledging implicit generation interval assumptions in phylodynamic inference and points to the need for methodological developments in phylodynamic inference to provide greater flexibility in the specification of accurate generation intervals.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Grafts that recovered function were enriched in regenerative proximal tubular (PT) cells co-expressing PROM1, CD24, and injury markers, consistent with scattered tubular cells (STCs). In contrast, non-recovering grafts contained a unique subpopulation of transitional proximal tubule cells (tPT4) characterized by dedifferentiation, loss of epithelial identity, and acquisition of fibroblast-like features. Fibroblast trajectory analysis revealed a profibrotic lineage, progressing from stromal progenitors to myofibroblasts, exclusive to nonrecovery grafts. Immune profiling showed divergent macrophage (M{varphi}) polarization, with reparative M{varphi}2 cells and regulatory dendritic cell (DC)-like signatures in recovering grafts, versus inflammatory M{varphi}1 and pro-fibrotic DCs in non-recovery. IMC confirmed spatial colocalization of injured tubules, activated fibroblasts, and immune cells in fibrotic regions, validated in an independent cohort. Functional assays demonstrated that ischemic epithelial injury activated monocyte-derived M{varphi}s with mixed inflammatory/reparative profiles and induced fibroblast-related gene expression, while PAX8 knockdown impaired epithelial proliferation and promoted pro-inflammatory signaling.

We investigated whether exposures to 2,2',4,4',5-pentaBDE (BDE-99), a predominant PBDE congener, can induce neurobehavioral and molecular effects across two generations using the marine vertebrate model fish Fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic killifish). To assess how exposure route influences outcomes, we conducted two complementary experiments: in the progenitor exposure experiment, adult fish were exposed to BDE-99 through diet, leading to maternal transfer into F1 eggs, while in the direct embryonic exposure experiment, embryos were exposed to BDE-99 via waterborne exposure, achieving comparable embryonic doses. Both exposure routes resulted in altered photomotor responses in F1 larvae, but additional effects differed by exposure route. In the progenitor exposure, maternally exposed F1 juvenile fish exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior and changes in brain gene expression, while in the direct embryonic exposure, F0 fish showed no detectable effects within their generation but caused behavioral alterations in F1 descendants. The lack of effects in direct F0 individuals suggests that neurobehavioral effects observed in maternally exposed F1 fish were not solely due to BDE-99 transfer but were influenced by additional maternal factors. In the progenitor exposure, neither behavioral nor gene expression effects persisted in the F2 generation. We conclude that maternal influences play a key role in shaping multigenerational effects of BDE-99 exposure, as indicated by the strong effects observed in maternally exposed F1 fish but not in F2 descendants, as well as the differences between maternally exposed fish and those exposed to comparable doses of BDE-99 alone.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

As a minimal genetic modification, nanosd does not induce widespread transcriptomic perturbations, and its susceptibility to Plasmodium spp. and O'nyong nyong virus infection remains similar to wild-type mosquitoes. Importantly, we find that nanosd propagates efficiently in caged mosquito populations and is maintained as a source of Cas9 after the emergence of drive resistant alleles whilst also mobilising a non-autonomous antiparasitic effector modification. The nanosd gene drive shows promise as a genetic tool for malaria vector control via population modification, and we outline steps towards its further optimization.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Sustained or repeated exposure to capsaicin, a classic TRPV1 agonist, induces TRPV1 desensitization. This partially accounts for the analgesic effect of capsaicin. However, the regulatory mechanisms of TRPV1 desensitization remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that capsaicin acts on TRPV1 to induce the activation of calpain, a Ca2+-sensitive cysteine protease, in a manner unrelated to cellular injury. Calpain cleaves rTRPV1 at the carboxyl terminus of G819/S820. Lack of the distal carboxyl terminus leads to reduced TRPV1 localization on the plasma membrane, potentially due to increased receptor internalization and impaired subunit assembly. This finding was corroborated by whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Additionally, the {Delta}820-838 mutant of rTRPV1 shows resistance to tachyphylaxis as induced by repetitive capsaicin stimulation. This study reveals a pivotal role for calpain in TRPV1 desensitization where its activation constrains TRPV1 channel function while simultaneously increasing its resistance to tachyphylaxis, thereby acting to maintain TRPV1 activity within an appropriate range.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Yet, there is a growing body of work to suggest that the intention to grasp an object can alter the representation of features such that they are separately represented during different stages of motor planning and execution, whereas some object features such as shape and size might form integrated representations when afforded by motor control. However, it remains untested whether these features were integrated as an outcome of the requirements of grasping motor control, or due to attention towards the object in general. Therefore, here we investigated how task-relevancy modulates the integration of grasp-relevant object features. To this end, we recorded electroencephalography while human participants grasped or reached for objects that varied in their orientation and size. Using multivariate analyses, we found a superadditive integration of object orientation and size during action planning for grasping but not reaching. These integrated representations likely facilitated the calculation of stable grasp points as further evidenced by the representations of grasp-specific visual size and grip size emerging at similar times. Our results provide novel insights into the vital role of action intention on cognitive representations in the human brain.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Within this study we explored mitochondrial function in a range of diTerent experimental models of MJD, including transgenic zebrafish, mice and neuronal cells, to gain an understanding of mitochondrial function in the disease, and possible mechanisms of any dysfunction. Firstly, we examined the transgenic CMVMJD135 mouse model that develops impaired movement, neurodegeneration and decreased survival. We performed proteomic analysis on brain lysates extracted from a cohort of male and female WT and MJD mice, for analysis of diTerences in male and female mice separately. We identified that a major diTerence predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to be in both male and female MJD mice was related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We examined primary neuron cultures obtained from CMVMJD135 mice, validating the findings of the proteomic analysis, and finding changes to mitochondrial morphology, as well. We further examined a transgenic zebrafish model of MJD that expresses EGFP fused human ataxin-3 with short or long polyQ stretches (23 or 84Q, respectively) in neurons (expression driven under the elav/HuC promoter). The MJD zebrafish also exhibit altered mitochondrial electron transport chain complex protein levels, together with enhanced sensitivity to rotenone administration, which may be a valuable readout for treatment investigation studies in the future. Together, this study confirms, and extends on, the growing body of evidence suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in MJD, warranting investigation for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) is well-suited to detect these alterations at scale due to its numerous practical advantages, but it has not yet been applied to dementia. In this study, we investigated resting state functional connectivity across the prefrontal cortex in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, n = 22), Alzheimer's Disease (AD, n = 21), and in healthy controls (n = 22). A graph theoretical approach was taken to characterise both global and local patterns of connectivity over a five-minute resting period. We found that individuals with AD and MCI exhibited denser and stronger networks, with shorter path lengths, as well as a loss of consistent key network hubs with worsening cognitive impairment. These results indicate that networks in dementia are more globally connected, albeit in a disorganised manner, perhaps reflecting the recruitment of additional connections for short-term stability which may be ultimately damaging in the long-term. Following the demonstration of HD-DOT's capacity to detect differences between healthy ageing and dementia, this work opens up new possibilities for the use of optical imaging in the study of this clinical population and HD-DOT's potential for scalable clinical use.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "How does the brain integrate sensory inputs with non-feature-tuned signals, such as those arising from behavioral state changes or neuromodulation? Here, we show that the dynamics of disordered E/I networks with structured, feature-dependent connectivity can be well characterized by an effective model describing interactions between the responses of cells who prefer the current sensory stimulus (\"matched\" cells) and the responses of cells firing at the baseline. This effective network exhibits strong feedback from the baseline onto the matched responses but weak reverse projections. Thus, an untuned stimulus not only directly drives matched cells, but also indirectly drives them via modulation of the baseline. We demonstrate through a linear response analysis that the baseline effect on the matched response is suppressive if the network is strongly coupled and feedback-inhibition dominated. In particular, in this regime, feature-dependent networks produce \"rate reshuffling\", wherein untuned optogenetic excitation yields large changes in the individual responses of matched cells without significantly changing their overall firing rate distribution, as the optogenetically-induced baseline response suppresses the matched response. Finally, if multiple sensory stimuli are presented, yielding sublinear response summation (\"normalization\"), the influence of the baseline on the matched responses is weakened. Thus, an untuned (eg, optogenetic) stimulus is less suppressive to multiple stimuli than to a single stimulus, making normalization effectively weaker in the presence of an untuned stimulus. Our framework provides the first theory of the interaction of untuned modulatory and tuned sensory inputs, reconciles prior experiments, and provides testable predictions about tuned-untuned interactions in cortical processing.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have established that Pavlovian fear conditioning increases the intrinsic excitability of BLA projection neurons. Learning-associated increases in excitability are hypothesised to facilitate the induction of synaptic plasticity and integration of neurons into functional learning circuits. Here, we examined whether instrumental learning produces similar changes in intrinsic excitability. Male and Female Long Evans rats were trained to lever press for a food reward and subsequently split into 3 behavioural groups; punished, yoked, and reward. Punished rats received response-contingent footshocks, yoked rats received response-independent footshocks, and reward rats received no shock. Intrinsic excitability was measured as the number of action potentials (APs) evoked by a series of depolarising current injections during whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Reward learning increased the intrinsic excitability of BLA projection neurons compared to naive controls. Punishment training maintained excitability and excitability was correlated with performance on the punishment task. Response-independent footshocks arrested reward-associated increases in excitability, reverting the BLA neurons to a naive state. Group differences were observed in AP half-width and the current underlying the post-burst AHP. Together, these findings show that instrumental reward learning enhances the intrinsic excitability of BLA projection neurons, potentially supporting action-outcome encoding by promoting synaptic plasticity and circuit integration. The results also suggest that different forms of learning engage distinct biophysical adaptations. A mechanistic understanding of the neurobiology underlying instrumental association learning may help inform the development of treatments for psychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in this process, such as major depressive disorder and conduct disorder.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we extend deep mutational learning (DML), a method integrating combinatorial mutagenesis, yeast surface display, deep sequencing, and machine learning, to analyze serum polyclonal antibody escape. Human sera from COVID-19-vaccinated individuals were screened against diverse RBD variant libraries, validating 300 serum-variant interactions across 10 individuals by comparing predicted and observed binding to 30 RBD variants, confirming accurate mapping of binding and escape profiles. Model performance remained consistent across machine learning architectures, suggesting that serum binding and escape are governed by distinct, localized RBD sequence features. Notably, escape profiles were highly individualized, whereas binding signatures were more conserved, reflecting convergent epitope targeting. This approach highlights the potential of DML to generalize beyond observed RBD variants, assess cohort-specific immune breadth, and inform vaccine and therapeutic design in the face of viral evolution.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

During the vertical transmission, gut symbionts rapidly colonize the unoccupied host lumen, nonetheless, how symbionts adapt to the dynamic changes of host environment, and contribute to the structural and immunological maturation remains elusive. Here, we show that the early gut symbiont Bacteroides fragilis produces a species- and stage-specific sphingolipid, alpha-galactosylceramide (BfaGC), that orchestrates neonatal colonization and immune modulation. BfaGC stabilizes membrane integrity and facilitates aerobic respiration, providing a critical advantage under early-life oxygen exposure. Temporally induced in the neonatal gut, BfaGC is necessary to regulate colonic type I natural killer T (NKT) cells, highlighting metabolic adaptation of the symbiont is synchronized with the time-sensitive host development.

At 24 h post-infection (hpi), compared to their ND littermates, D-mice showed significantly higher GBS CFUs in the bladder, the kidneys, and the spleen. This was accompanied by a significantly reduced recruitment of CD45+ leukocytes to and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in GBS-infected D-bladder and D-kidneys compared to their ND counterparts. We also noted sex-dependent differences in GBS urinary tissue tropism. For example, D-females exhibited significantly higher bladder burden compared to ND-females, D-males, and ND-males, while the bladder burden in ND-females was not significantly different from that in ND-males. In contrast, ND-males showed significantly higher kidney CFUs than ND-females and DM further increased kidney CFU burden in males. GBS-induced recruitment of CD45+ leukocytes was not different between male and female mice within either D or ND cohorts. GBS-UTI induced significantly higher CXCL1 production in male bladders in both D and ND cohorts compared to their female counterparts.

There is usually substantial microbiome variation between different plant individuals and populations, and the drivers of this variation are still poorly understood, particularly in wild plants. Here, we were interested in the potential for plant genotype and plant age to explain intraspecific variation in the plant microbiome. In seven natural populations, we genotyped a total of 168 plants over four years, determined their ages through herb chronology, and then sequenced their root, shoot, flower and seed microbiomes. We found that plant genotypes differed both in the diversity and composition of microbes, and that some microbial taxa were associated with particular plant genotypes - a result that we experimentally confirmed for one of the observed genotype-microbe associations. The genotype effects tended to be strongest and most consistent for plant-associated bacteria, with the largest plant genotype differences in the microbiome diversity of flowers and seeds. In contrast to the widespread plant genotype effects, we found less evidence for an effect of plant age on microbiome diversity: the age of plants explained variation in fungi diversity, and it was associated with the abundance of several microbial taxa. Our study indicates that the genotype of a plant and - to a lesser degree its age - influence the diversity and composition of plant-associated microbiota, even in complex natural environments.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

It acquires host macromolecular nutrients, by receptor mediated endocytosis. The best characterised receptor is for transferrin (TfR) and it has been reported to be sequestered in the flagellar pocket, the sole site of endocytosis. In this location the TfR may be inaccessible to adaptive immune system effectors. The T. brucei genome encodes ~15 TfR variants, and here we compared two, the first attached to the plasma membrane by a single glycosylphosphoinositol (GPI)-anchor and the other by two. Transferrin uptake kinetics were similar and rapid for both. Unexpectedly, initial binding of transferrin occurred over the whole cell surface suggesting the TfR was not sequestered in the flagellar pocket. This localisation was confirmed by immunofluorescence assays and was independent of the number of GPI-anchors. Two other GPI-anchored receptors were investigated to determine whether localisation to the whole cell surface was a general property of GPI-anchored receptors. Haptoglobin-haemoglobin uptake assays and immunofluorescence localisation of complement factor H receptor showed both were also whole cell surface localised.

Microbial public goods systems employ diverse solutions to this dilemma, yet most studies assume fixed strategies wherein genotypes function strictly as cooperators or cheaters.

When haploid cheater-cooperator strains were co-evolved in melibiose, we observed the repeated emergence of same-mating-type diploid hybrids. These hybrids arise early in evolution and ultimately spread in the population. The hybrids exploit the public good produced by cooperator strains when present, acting as facultative cheaters. However, following cooperator extinction, hybrids switch to a cooperative phenotype. This dynamic role transition enables the hybrid to persist across shifting ecological contexts. Our findings reveal a novel, context-dependent mechanism of cooperation maintenance, whereby facultative cheating and genotype plasticity resolve the tension between individual fitness and collective benefit.

Among other attributes, it is distinctive because it undergoes sex reversal from ZZ genotypic males to phenotypic females at high incubation temperatures. Here, we report an annotated telomere to telomere phased assembly of the genome of a female ZW central bearded dragon. Results: Genome assembly length is 1.75 Gbp with a scaffold N50 of 266.2 Mbp, N90 of 28.1 Mbp, 26 gaps and 42.2% GC content. Most (99.6%) of the reference assembly is scaffolded into 6 macrochromosomes and 10 microchromosomes, including the Z and W microchromosomes, corresponding to the karyotype. The genome assembly exceeds standard recommended by the Earth Biogenome Project (6CQ40): 0.003% collapsed sequence, 0.03% false expansions, 99.8% k-mer completeness, 97.9% complete single copy BUSCO genes and an average of 93.5% of transcriptome data mappable back to the genome assembly. The mitochondrial genome (16,731 bp) and the model rDNA repeat unit (length 9.5 Kbp) were assembled. Male vertebrate sex genes Amh and Amhr2 were discovered as copies in the small non-recombining region of the Z chromosome, absent from the W chromosome. This, coupled with the prior discovery of differential Z and W transcriptional isoform composition arising from pseudoautosomal sex gene Nr5a1, suggests that complex interactions between these genes, their autosomal copies and their resultant transcription factors and intermediaries, determines sex in the bearded dragon.

Early-life development is particularly vulnerable, and many marine species spend early life in nearshore environments, elevating their risk of pollutant exposure. Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are persistent and ubiquitous pollutants, particularly in nearshore marine environments. They disrupt early-life development and pose ongoing risks for ocean health. However, whether early-life exposure influences neurotoxic effects, and whether those effects are durable throughout life, remains poorly understood. Using Fundulus heteroclitus, we tested whether early-life exposure to 2,2',4,4',5-pentaBDE (BDE-99) leads to persistent behavioral and molecular alterations in adulthood and whether outcomes differ by exposure route. We conducted two complementary experiments comparing progenitor (maternal) exposure and direct waterborne exposure during embryonic development. Similar doses to developing fish were achieved in both experiments. After hatch, all fish were reared in clean water until adulthood over two years later, at which time we assessed impacts on behavior and brain gene expression. Both exposure routes led to long-term hyperactivity and reduced anxiety-like behavior, but specific effects varied by dose and sex. Progenitor exposure altered behavior and the brain transcriptome in F1 males (females not tested), whereas direct embryonic exposure affected behavior in females and not males. These findings highlight the importance of maternal influences, such as chemical metabolites, altered lipid provisioning, small molecules, and epigenetic imprinting, alongside chemical transfer, in shaping the long-term persistence of behavioral and molecular effects from early-life exposure. The distinct effects between exposure routes suggest that dosing with chemical alone is not the only determinant of toxicity. We conclude that maternal factors that are modified by exposure significantly contribute to health outcomes in developing offspring, emphasizing the need to consider exposure route when assessing risks from persistent pollutants. Given that maternal and environmental exposures co-occur in nature, future studies should assess their combined impacts to better predict real-world risks.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

For at least 1 month, PKM{zeta} and EYFP-PKM{zeta} colocalization persistently increase in the hippocampal tri-synaptic pathway (dentate gyrus (DG)[-&gt;]CA3[-&gt;]CA1). We thus use DG, CA3, and CA1 transcriptional profiling to identify mRNAs for PKM{zeta} and other molecules that might contribute to maintaining the memory. We find that memory persistence correlates with the upregulation of IEGs Arc, Fos, and NPas4 in DG. In contrast, expression of CaMKII, PKM{zeta}, PKC/{lambda}, KIBRA, and most other LTP-associated proteins do not covary with memory. This result rules out strong memory-related transcriptional regulation, but not regulation of mRNA translation or stability of these 'shadow proteins' that, despite being crucial for memory maintenance, evade detection by unbiased transcriptome profiling. We further examine whether covarying gene expression defines molecular ensembles that predict memory and Prkcz expression. Community detection, applied to both linear and non-linear pairwise gene co-expression relationships, reveals gene co-expression networks predictive of memory, memory-related IEGs, and Prkcz expression. These findings trace: i) a PKM{zeta} engram in the hippocampus; and highlight: ii) sustained IEGs upregulation in >24-h memory maintenance; iii) the utility of investigating both linear and non-linear gene expression covariance patterns; iv) limits of transcriptional profiling for identifying long-term memory molecules, most of which appear to be in 'shadow' ; and demonstrates v) that weak pair-wise gene-gene correlations can identify strong gene co-expression networks related to behavioral and shadow molecular estimates of long-term memory.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Symptoms following mTBI fall into physical, emotional, sleep, and cognitive categories, with memory deficits being a commonly documented sequelae. Whereas many animal models of mTBI exist, relatively few studies have examined the cognitive deficits of mTBI with human-like cognitive tasks. The Wayne State University Closed Head Weight Drop Model recapitulates critical physical elements of sport-related concussions and trauma-based mTBI. However, until now, this model has not previously been evaluated using a human-like memory task. Rats were trained in an odor-based item-in-context task that dissociates episodic and non-episodic memory (Panoz-Brown et al., Current Biology, 2016). The animals then underwent either a weight drop or a sham procedure. After the manipulation, animals were assessed in the item-in-context task. Episodic memory was significantly impaired in the injured rats by over 10% but not in the sham rats. Non-episodic memory was not impaired in either group. Additionally, a time-course immunohistochemical analysis of the hippocampus was performed to examine possible time-dependent changes in ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (iba1), a marker of activated microglia/macrophages and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes. Concussion injury was associated with time-dependent morphological changes in astrocytes and microglia in injured rats compared to sham rats.

Here, we evaluated the effects of oseltamivir on viral shedding dynamics in the context of experimental influenza infection. We analyzed individual participant data, including viral load, time to symptom alleviation, and laboratory test measurements, obtained from three publicly available clinical trials involving experimental infections with influenza A and B viruses. We applied mathematical modeling and estimated parameters using a nonlinear mixed-effects model to capture viral infection dynamics. Our analysis revealed that, compared with placebo groups, the oseltamivir-treated groups tended to have lower values in terms of viral load area under the curve, duration of infection, peak viral titer, and time to peak; however, most of these differences were not significant; and no dose-dependent effects were observed. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between time to symptom alleviation and viral load. Some laboratory test parameters showed opposing correlations with symptom-related and viral load-related outcomes. These findings are consistent with distinct mechanisms underlying the symptom-alleviating effects of oseltamivir and its antiviral activity. Our findings suggest that the availability of individual-level data for public use is essential because it enables the evaluation of mechanisms in clinical trials and the development of more appropriate outcome measures.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Here we investigated interactions between Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, co-infecting opportunistic pathogens found in pneumonia and chronic lung infections, including in cystic fibrosis. We found that S. maltophilia forms robust protective multicellular aggregates upon exposure to P. aeruginosa secreted factors. Experimental evolution for lack of aggregation selected for fimbrial mutations and we found that fimbriae are required on both interacting S. maltophilia cells for aggregation. Untargeted metabolomics and targeted validations revealed that the quorum sensing molecule Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) directly induced S. maltophilia aggregation, and co-localized with the aggregates. Further, in co-culture with P. aeruginosa, wild-type S. maltophilia formed aggregates, resulting in up to 75-fold increased survival from P. aeruginosa competition compared to fimbrial mutants. Finally, multiple other bacterial species similarly aggregated upon exposure to P. aeruginosa exoproducts, indicating a more general response. Collectively, our work identifies a novel multispecies interaction where a quorum sensing molecule from a co-infecting pathogen is sensed as a \"danger\" signal, thereby inducing a protective multicellular response.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

F.; Crismani, W.", "abstract": "Synthetic lethality describes a genetic relationship where the loss of two genes results in cell death, but the loss of one of those genes does not. Drugs used for precision oncology can exploit synthetic lethal relationships; the best described are PARP inhibitors which preferentially kill BRCA1-deficient tumours preferentially over BRCA1-proficient cells. New synthetic lethal targets are often discovered using genetic screens, such as CRISPR knockout screens. Here, we present a competitive co-culture assay that can be used to analyse drugs or gene knockouts with synthetic lethal effects. We generated new BRCA1 isogenic cell line pairs from both a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (SUM149) and adapted pre-existing non-cancerous BRCA1 isogenic pair (RPE). Each cell line of the isogenic pair was transformed with its own fluorescent reporter. The two-coloured cell lines of the isogenic pair were then grown together in the same vessel to create a more competitive environment compared to when grown separately. We used four PARP inhibitors to validate the ability to detect synthetic lethality in BRCA1-deficient cancer cells. The readout of the assay was performed by counting the fluorescently coloured cells after drug treatment using flow cytometry. We observed preferential targeting of BRCA1-deficient cells, by PARPi, at relative concentrations that broadly reflect clinical dosing. Further we reveal subtle differences between PARPi resistant lines compared to BRCA1-proficient cells. Here, we demonstrate the validation and potential use of the competitive assay, which could be extended to validating novel genetic relationships and adapted for live cell imaging.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

A key question is whether this cross-modal reorganization is driven by sensory deprivation itself or through enhanced use of the spared senses. We investigated how different rearing environments shape neural responses in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of short-tailed opossums (Monodelphis domestica), following elimination of visual inputs through bilateral enucleation in early development. Early blind and sighted littermates were reared in enriched environments to promote active tactile exploration in three-dimensional (3D) space, or in highly restricted standard laboratory cages. In adulthood, both enriched groups showed adaptive changes in exploration patterns and gap crossing behaviors relative to standard-reared counterparts. Thus, early blind animals showed behavioral compensation for vision loss, when challenged by complex environments. Enriched rearing increased selectivity of S1 neural responses to whisker touch and powerfully altered receptive field shapes such that they were less horizontally anisotropic. This shift was strongest in enriched early blind animals, enhancing tuning along the horizontal axis more than standard-reared early blind animals. Thus, alterations in S1 receptive fields following early blindness were amplified by environmental complexity. Sighted opossums reared with enrichment also showed similar whisker receptive field plasticity, though to a slightly lower degree. Together, these results demonstrate the strong influence of the rearing environment on reorganization of cortex that processes inputs from the spared senses, underscoring the role of experience in directing compensatory plasticity following early sensory loss.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Disruption of H3K4 methylation is associated with numerous neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs) that display intellectual disability and abnormal body growth. Here, we perturb H3K4 methylation in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and the hypothalamus, two brain regions associated with these disease phenotypes. These mutant mice have fewer forebrain interneurons, deficient network rhythmogenesis, and increased spontaneous seizures and seizure susceptibility. Mutant mice are significantly smaller than control littermates, but they eventually became obese due to striking changes in the genetic and cellular hypothalamus environment in these mice. Perturbation of H3K4 methylation in these cells produces deficits in numerous NDD-associated behaviors, with a bias for more severe phenotypes in female mice. Single cell sequencing reveals transcriptional changes in the embryonic and adult brain that underlie many of these phenotypes. In sum, our findings highlight the critical role of H3K4 methylation in regulating survival and cell-specific gene regulatory mechanisms in forebrain GABAergic and hypothalamic cells during neurodevelopment to control network excitability and body size homoeostasis.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

This is true for the endangered sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus, which has a global distribution and long-distance migrations. While previous studies revealed mitochondrial population structure with weak nuclear structure globally, genomic approaches examining this pattern have been limited. Understanding connectivity is critical for the management of this species due to population declines relative to pre-whaling, recent impacts from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and ongoing threats from anthropogenic sound. We investigated the connectivity between two regions, the U.S. Gulf of America (Mexico) and western North Atlantic Ocean, using reduced representation genomics and mitochondrial control region sequencing of 73 sperm whales. We found that relatedness decreased with geographic distance, likely due to the presence of familial structure. Nuclear markers showed no population structure (FST = 0.001-0.008), while mitochondrial structure was high (FST = 0.36-0.65), consistent with male-biased dispersal and female philopatry. Across all samples, genetic diversity (nuclear: 0.0014; mitochondrial: 0.0017) and effective population size (Ne=460) were low. Given this low diversity and evidence for the partitioning of genetic variation, we recommend managers treat these two regions as distinct in order to preserve existing variation and promote resilience of this species. These results show that despite the increased power of a genomic approach, it is essential to consider the biology of the species at hand and leverage both mitochondrial and nuclear markers to understand the genetic structure of threatened species.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

Preservation of LC can have structural and functional origins identifiable from key brain regions of the language network (LAN). To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed the relationships among resting-state brain functional connectivity (rsFC) derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, structural connectivity (SC) derived from diffusion MRI metrices, and behaviour (LC and LP) using a cross-sectional cohort of healthy adults (N = 652; aged 18-88). Six cognitive tasks assessing LC and LP were employed, with neuroimaging measures focused on region-specific connections within the LAN. Using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), complex brain-behaviour interactions were identified. Behavioral analyses revealed established age-related dichotomy, LC abilities in vocabulary and proverb comprehension improved and in syntactic and semantic comprehension remained stable, whereas LP tasks, e.g., verbal fluency, picture priming, and tip of tongue exhibited significant decline across the lifespan. SC exhibited decline in both intra- and inter-hemispheric fronto-temporal and frontal lobe connections, contrasted by preserved or enhanced temporal lobe connectivity, supporting a pattern of frontal vulnerability concomitant with temporal resilience. Age-related FC patterns demonstrated overall preservation, reflecting compensatory mechanisms to sustain functional integrity despite structural degradation. GAMM analyses revealed complex relationships between brain connectivity and language performance across age. Thus, integrating knowledge of brain structure, function, and language abilities, we identified the brain network mechanisms associated with dichotomous language behavior along lifespan.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

However, their application has so far been limited to songbirds, which are widely used to study behaviors related to vocal communication. In this study, we applied and evaluated designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD)-mediated neural suppression in songbird's brains, focusing on its impacts on vocalizations. We found that neuronal activity in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) can be effectively suppressed both in vitro and in vivo using the inhibitory DREADD by its ligand deschloroclozapine (DCZ). By establishing a high-throughput system for recording and analyzing their vocalizations, we systematically assessed the effects of DREADD-mediated suppression on song behavior. Inhibiting HVC in zebra finches led to a reduction in song production number for approximately 90 min and altered phonological features over a longer time course. Notably, the concentration of DCZ required to induce robust effects on song behaviors was higher than doses typically used in mice. Furthermore, suppression of HVC or Area X in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) produced a distinct effect on song features, suggesting species-specific responses to chemogenetic intervention. These findings refine the use of chemogenetic tools in songbirds and provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying vocal communication.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": ""}

By integrating connectomic data with spatial transcriptomic profiles from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, SPERRFY deciphers latent positional gradients that underlie axonal wiring. Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we extract top gradient pairs that align with observed neural connectivity patterns, capturing both global (inter-regional) and local (intra-regional) organizational principles. Connectivity reconstruction based on these gradients achieves high predictive performance (AUC = 0.90), and permutation-based null models confirm the biological relevance of the inferred structures. Furthermore, SPERRFY identifies candidate genes that may contribute to positional wiring information, providing molecular insight into the developmental logic of brain-wide circuitry.

Here, we asked whether a measure of semantic feature predictability can better account for N400 amplitude modulation. We reanalysed two independent EEG datasets (N = 26 and N = 334), computing lexical and semantic cloze for each critical word. Across the two datasets, semantic cloze explained significantly more N400 variance than lexical cloze. Using the same materials, we then compared semantic and lexical cloze with probabilities from four large language models (GPT-2, GPT-2.7b, RoBERTa, ALBERT). None of the LLM-derived predictors outperformed semantic cloze. Our findings support the view that the N400 primarily reflects semantic---not exact-word---processing.
