These forces are feeble and are influenced by environmental factors; as a result, they have often been measured under non-physiological stimulation. Furthermore, a full description of the dynamics of force onset is still missing. Here we investigate the early interaction of T cells with specifically activating ultra- soft hydrogels, which mimic target cells with physiologically relevant stiffness of 350-450 Pa. We quantify the dependence of cell spreading and stiffness on gel elasticity, and measure the morphodynamics of early time traction stresses. The time evolution of the strength of traction forces is quantified as the total elastic energy stored in the gel, and the spatial orientation is characterized via the Cauchy stress tensor. We show that T cells generate stresses in distinct spatio-temporal patterns, which can be sorted into 3 categories: random active-noise, localized intermittent-stress, or a sigmoidal energy-time curve arising from a dipole-like spatial pattern which is usually extensile, and rarely contractile. The relative proportion of cells in each category is condition and T cell subtype dependent. The pattern categories likely reflect the way in which the cell interacts with the target via distinct and variously deployed actin-based protrusions. In primary human T cells, the subtype and initial state of the cells strongly impact the relative proportions in each category, in a way that appears coherent with their physiological role. A single metric, which averages the stresses over space and time, fails to capture the stimulation/subtype dependent force application that may be biologically relevant for cell function.\n\nSignificance statementThe very first step of acquired immunity depends on recognition of pathogenic peptides by T cells using their special T cell receptors. This process relies on application of forces by the cell, which we measure. These measurements reveal hitherto unknown traction dynamics that is not only ligand and stiffness dependent, but also Primary T cell subtype dependent. We propose mechanisms of force application whereby early filopodia generated feeble forces evolve, depending on condition and cell subtype, into intermittent or sustained lamellipodia generated stress that can be extensile or contractile. We hypothesize that these different modes of force application may be linked to the specific physiology of the T cell subtype.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

As a functional strategy that has evolved in response to abiotic disturbance regimes, they are likely to play a key role in determining biodiversity patterns across the world's biomes and habitats. At the same time, patterns in soil seed banks are likely to reflect scale-dependent patterns observed in above-ground vegetation. Here, we investigate components of diversity in the soil seed bank across global biomes and ecosystems, accounting for sampled soil area and geographic extent. We found that patterns of species richness in the soil seed bank diverged from patterns of density, although there were high levels of uncertainty in the results, especially at smaller spatial scales. Importantly, habitat degradation consistently led to lower richness, potentially limiting future ecosystem recovery. Among ecosystems, Mediterranean and tropical regions were broadly found to have high species richness, but seed density m-2 in the soil was highest in wetlands and arable systems. Lower densities were found generally in both high-diversity tropical biomes that are characterised by short-lived seeds, and low-diversity boreal and tundra biomes with more stable established vegetation. We show how different components of the soil seed bank depend on the interplay between local environmental conditions and global biomes, with implications for understanding biodiversity at the global scale.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

However, little is known as to whether this learned suppression operates in retinotopic (relative to the eyes) or spatiotopic (relative to the world) coordinates. In the current study, two circular search arrays were presented side by side. Participants learned the high-probability location from a learning array presented on one side of the display (e.g., left). After several trials, participants shifted their gaze to the center of the other search array (e.g., located on the right side) and continued searching without any location probability (labelled as \"test array\"). Due to the saccade, the test array contained both a spatiotopic and a retinotopic matching location relative to the original high-probability location. The current findings show that, following saccadic eye movements, the learned suppression remained in retinotopic coordinates only, with no measurable transfer to spatiotopic coordinates. Even in a rich environment, attentional suppression still operated exclusively in retinotopic coordinates. We speculate that learned suppression may be resolved by changing synaptic weights in early visual areas.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

To address these challenges, we developed an experimental and computational pipeline to extract properties at scales ranging from cell to tissue.

The development of tool use proficiency has been well-documented in nut-cracking chimpanzees and robust capuchins, and in shellfish-cracking long-tailed macaques, where mothers and proficient tool users are the most important models for social learning. However, little is known about how tool use develops in populations where opportunities for social learning are scarce. White-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator) on Jicaron Island, Panama, provide a unique case to consider this question: stone tool use is entirely male-biased, meaning juveniles cannot learn from their mothers, and reduced group cohesion further limits social learning opportunities. Here, we investigate the acquisition and development of stone tool proficiency in this population using a year-long dataset from camera traps placed at two experimental anvils. We assess differences in proficiency between age classes, examine the development of tool use proficiency over time, and explore patterns of social attention during tool use. We show that juvenile capuchins are less proficient than subadults and adults, but their proficiency remains stable over the course of one year, suggesting that skill development may require prolonged practice or physical maturation. In contrast to other primates, social learning opportunities on Jicaron appear limited and scrounging is rare, yet when social attention occurs, we find robust patterns. Social attention to tool use mostly comes from juveniles too young to use tools themselves, who observe proficient subadults that tolerate scrounging. Our results contribute to the understanding of how complex tool use behaviours are acquired and maintained in primates. They highlight that even when tool use is largely solitary, directed social attention and social tolerance play an important role in the development of tool use proficiency.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

The neural and synaptic mechanisms supporting the rapid encoding and maintenance of memories in diverse tasks are the subject of an ongoing debate. The traditional view of WM as stationary persistent firing of selective neuronal populations has given room to newer ideas regarding mechanisms that support a more dynamic maintenance of multiple items. Various computational WM models based on different biologically plausible plasticity mechanisms have been proposed. We show that these proposed short-term plasticity mechanisms may not necessarily be competing explanations, but instead yield interesting interactions that broaden the functional range of models on a wide set of WM task motifs and simultaneously enhance the biological plausibility of spiking neural network models, in particular of the underlying synaptic plasticity. While reductionist models (WM function explained by one particular mechanism) are theoretically appealing and have increased our understanding of specific mechanisms, they are narrow explanations. In this study we evaluate the interactions between three commonly proposed classes of plasticity, namely intrinsic excitability, synaptic facilitation/augmentation and Hebbian plasticity. We systematically test combinations of mechanisms in a spiking neural network model on a broad suite of tasks or functional motifs deemed principally important for WM operation, such as one-shot encoding, free and cued recall, multi-item delay maintenance and updating. Our analysis of the operational task performance indicates that a composite model is superior to more reductionist variants.

However, the mechanism by which ZMAT3 functions within the p53 pathway remains largely unclear. Here, we discovered a function of ZMAT3 in inhibiting transcription of HKDC1, a hexokinase that regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration. Quantitative proteomics revealed HKDC1 as the most significantly upregulated protein in ZMAT3-depleted colorectal cancer cells. ZMAT3 depletion resulted in increased mitochondrial respiration, which was rescued by simultaneous depletion of HKDC1, suggesting that HKDC1 is a critical downstream effector of ZMAT3. Unexpectedly, ZMAT3 did not bind to HKDC1 RNA or DNA; however, proteomic analysis of the ZMAT3 interactome identified its interaction with the oncogenic transcription factor JUN. ZMAT3 depletion enhanced JUN binding to the HKDC1 locus, leading to increased HKDC1 transcription that was rescued upon JUN depletion, suggesting that JUN activates HKDC1 transcription in ZMAT3-depleted cells.

Fusarium solani was the most frequently isolated species (39%) across all counties, followed by F. equiseti (22%), while F. flocciferum was the least frequently isolated species (2%). Greenhouse pathogenicity assays showed F. incarnatum caused significantly higher disease severity relative to non-inoculated control on aerial parts of cotton (P=0.0137), while Fusarium flocciferum, F. proliferatum, and F. clavum caused significantly higher disease severity relative to non-inoculated control on roots (P=0.01, P=0.01, P=0.02, respectively).

We hypothesized that designing mutations that are compatible with structurally distinct equilibrium conformations may enable reliable stability design. We focus on periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), a superfamily of dynamic proteins that change conformation from open to closed states in response to binding their small-molecule ligands. We find that the evolutionary constrained space of allowed mutations computed for one conformation is incompatible with the other. Therefore, putative conformational hinge points and interface residues were additionally constraint, and incompatible mutations were filtered out. Starting from four different PBPs, we designed a total of 16 stabilized variants with 7-28 mutations each. Our results show that design based on a single conformation with evolutionary constraints is not sufficient to maintain wild type-like binding affinity. Conversely, using a subset of mutations compatible with both conformations and structural constraints reliably enhances thermal stability while mitigating trade-offs in ligand binding.

The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (Marchantia) serves as a key model organism to study signaling pathways and to infer their evolution throughout the green lineage. Marchantia expresses key components of UV-B signaling, including the photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (MpUVR8), the WD40-repeat protein REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS (MpRUP), the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 / SUPPRESSOR OF phyA-105 (MpCOP1/MpSPA), and the transcriptional regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (MpHY5). Here, we show that MpUVR8 exists as a homodimer in its ground-state in vivo, then monomerizes and accumulates in the nucleus upon UV-B activation. Activated MpUVR8 interacts with MpCOP1, triggering growth inhibition, genome-wide gene expression changes, biosynthesis of UV-absorbing metabolites, and photoprotection, which overall contributes to UV-B stress tolerance. MpRUP facilitates redimerization of MpUVR8 and Mprup null mutants show enhanced UV-B photomorphogenesis, demonstrating that MpRUP efficiently represses MpUVR8 signaling. Unlike the case in Arabidopsis and in contrast to the strong Mpcop1 mutant phenotype, Mpspa mutants develop only a very weak constitutive photomorphogenesis phenotype, indicating that COP1 function is much more independent of SPA in Marchantia than in Arabidopsis. Moreover, in contrast to Arabidopsis SPAs, Mpspa is linked with a hyper-responsive UV-B phenotype, suggesting that MpSPA is a negative regulator of MpUVR8 signaling. Similar to Arabidopsis HY5/HYH, MpHY5 functions antagonistically to MpCOP1, but its role in UV-B-mediated gene expression changes is more limited. Our findings demonstrate that although core components of UV-B signaling existed in the last common ancestor of extant land plants, regulatory interactions have diversified in different lineages since their divergence more than 400 million years ago.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Although extensive studies have elucidated intrinsic protein sequence features governing their formation, how extrinsic factors within the chromatin environment modulate their assembly and pathogenic function remains poorly understood. Gain-of-function mutations in the histone acetylation reader ENL, found in pediatric leukemia and Wilms tumor, drive oncogenesis by inducing condensate formation at highly selective genomic loci. Here, we uncover a critical role for locally produced gene transcripts in reinforcing the nucleation, chromatin engagement, and oncogenic activity of ENL mutant condensates. Mutant ENL binds RNA in part through a conserved basic patch within its YEATS domain, and this interaction enhances condensate formation both in vitro and across diverse cellular contexts. Using a chemically inducible condensate displacement and re-nucleation system, we show that blocking ENL-RNA interactions or transcription impairs condensate reformation at endogenous targets. RNA interactions preferentially enhance mutant ENL occupancy at top-bound, condensate-permissive loci, leading to increased transcriptional bursting and robust gene activation at the single-cell and single-allele level. In mouse models, disrupting ENL-RNA interactions reduces condensate formation and oncogenic transcription in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, thereby suppressing ENL mutant-driven leukemogenesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that locally produced RNA transcripts can promote locus-specific nucleation of pathogenic condensates on chromatin, which in turn drive persistent and hyperactive transcription of oncogenic targets and lead to tumorigenesis.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

They exist in two functional states, Pr and Pfr, distinguished by Z/E isomers of their bilin chromophore. The chromophore can photoswitch between these states, but also thermally converts in darkness. Despite the importance of the latter reaction, it remains unclear how it is controlled by the phytochrome. Here, we present single-particle cryo-EM measurements on the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophytochrome (PaBphP) carried out at multiple time points during dark reversion from Pr to Pfr. These experiments resolve the structure of a PrPfr hybrid state. Surprisingly, we find that only protomer B converts back to Pfr in the hybrid, while protomer A remains in Pr. We identify structural asymmetries in the precursor Pr state, which extend from the homodimer interface to a conserved histidine (H277). The hydrogen-bonding network around the chromophore is modulated, explaining how the phytochrome gains control over the activation energy of the isomerization reaction. These findings establish that dark reversion is governed by conformational selection between two substates, whereby one is \"dark-reversion ready\" and the other one blocks the reaction. Moreover, we explain how the equilibrium of the states is allosterically controlled across the dimer.

Here, we investigated the effect of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated long-term expression of TBX18, and compared the outcome to that of the pacemaker ion channel Hcn2. Our findings revealed that CMV-driven ectopic TBX18 expression in mouse hearts led to severe cardiac fibrosis. At lower, non-fibrogenic levels, TBX18 maintained its transcriptional function but failed to induce pacemaker phenotypes. TBX18-expressing cells showed suppressed expression of key working myocardial genes, but the pacemaker gene program was not induced. Electrophysiological studies showed abnormal automaticity in TBX18-expressing cells, combined with prolonged repolarization and various current changes. However, no hyperpolarization-activated funny current was detected. In a complete AV-block rat model, AAV-mediated Hcn2 expression induced robust ectopic pacemaker activity in the presence of isoproterenol, whereas TBX18 expression neither generated such activities, nor augmented Hcn2-mediated pacing. In conclusion, at functional non-fibrogenic levels, TBX18 is neither sufficient nor necessary to induce pacemaker activity.

Using the equivalent noise method and perceptual template model, we estimated gain, internal noise, and nonlinearity for orientation discrimination across eccentricity (fovea, parafovea and perifovea) and around polar angle. Participants discriminated the orientation of Gabors embedded in dynamic white noise and showed the expected variations across eccentricity and around polar angle. Importantly, visual performance declined with eccentricity due to decreased gain and nonlinearity and increased internal noise. Observers with stronger eccentricity effects showed greater gain decrease. Only gain varied with polar angle--higher along the horizontal than vertical meridian, and lower than upper vertical meridian--paralleling performance asymmetries. This dissociation aligns with known variations in neuronal count and tuning, suggesting that neural correlations and neural noise contribute to these system-level computations.

Our group identified CDH1 loss-of-function variants segregating in families with CLP, with incomplete penetrance linked to promoter hypermethylation. Previously, we demonstrated that gene-environment interactions driven by pro-inflammatory factors can induce this methylation, downregulate E-cadherin expression, and impair neural crest migration, thereby contributing to the etiology of CLP. However, the embryonic consequences of the two-hit CLP model (CDH1 haploinsufficiency combined with pro-inflammatory insult) have not yet been explored in mammals. Here, under single dose of floxed-Cdh1, we investigated the pro-inflammatory response at the maternal-fetal interface, its impact on cytokine and Cdh1 expression along the anteroposterior axis, the associated epigenetic landscape in the embryonic head, and the effects on cranial NC-derived structures. We found that pro-inflammatory activation differentially signals to the embryo along the anteroposterior axis, impairing Cdh1/E-cadherin expression in NC cells of the head, accompanied by Cdh1 promoter hypermethylation and other differentially methylated genes involved in cell-junction maintenance. Our findings support a model in which maternal pro-inflammatory responses act as environmental factors that repress NC CDH1 expression through epigenetic mechanisms, contributing to CLP development by downregulating E-cadherin and potentially compromising overall epithelial integrity.

Antigenic drift is traditionally assessed using ferret antisera, which provide monospecific responses, and human vaccinee sera, which reflect exposure to multiple antigens. In this study we evaluated the pig as an alternative source of antisera to study antigenic drift compared to immune responses in ferrets and humans. We included seasonal influenza A(H1N1pdm09) human viruses that had shown different antigenic characteristics when using ferret or human antisera.\n\nMethodsPairs of pigs were inoculated with six human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating between 2019 and 2023, a period of marked antigenic drift.

L.", "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, uses a cell-cell communication system called quorum sensing (QS) to regulate gene expression in response to population density. P. aeruginosa QS involves, in part, two transcription factors, LasR and RhlR, that respond to N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signals. Two proteins known as \"antiactivators,\" QteE and QslA, attenuate QS by inhibiting LasR, RhlR, or both. While initial characterization of antiactivation has revealed the considerable influence these factors may have on dampening QS, details regarding the individual impacts of these antiactivators on P. aeruginosa QS activity remain scant. Additionally, the effects of antiactivators on RhlR QS activity and in QS systems in isolates or strain lacking LasR have yet to be explored. To investigate how QteE and QslA each modulate LasR or RhlR independently, we combined gene deletion and over-expression analysis of each antiactivator in wild-type P. aeruginosa (PAO1) and two strains with rhl-dominated QS: clinical isolate E90 and PAO {Delta}lasR {Delta}mexT. As measured with a transcriptional reporter, over-expression of qteE or qslA notably reduced RhlR activity in PAO1 and PAO {Delta}lasR {Delta}mexT, but only expression of qteE had a marked effect on RhlR activity in E90. Expression analysis indicates LasR and RhlR repress QteE transcription, but not QslA. By over-expressing qslA in the absence of QteE and vice versa, we demonstrate that QslA activity and corresponding effects on QS phenotypes can be QteE-dependent in some scenarios. Our results reveal a nuanced role for individual antiactivator proteins in affecting the layered P. aeruginosa QS circuitry.\n\nImportanceQuorum sensing (QS) is a cell signaling mechanism that enables populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to coordinate group behaviors such as biofilm formation, virulence factor production, and antibiotic tolerance once a critical cell-density threshold is reached. P. aeruginosa employs two \"antiactivator\" proteins that attenuate QS at low cell densities, dampening QS activation. The specific effects of individual antiactivators on the complex and hierarchically-arranged P. aeruginosa QS systems remain undefined. Here, we use two strains with rewired QS circuits to independently assess the effects of QS antiactivators on each QS circuit. We find that while one antiactivator selectively targets one QS circuit, the other can broadly target both with strong effects on QS activity. This work reveals an additional layer of complexity to counter-regulation of QS signalling and further defines antiactivation as a mechanism P. aeruginosa uses to finely tune QS responses.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

While sibling presence was associated with accelerated microbiota maturation and modest compositional differences, infants who both had siblings (or both lacked siblings) were no more similar to each other than mixed pairs. Instead, infants with siblings exhibited non-specific convergence with adult microbiota profiles and contributed fewer unique genera to their family metacommunities (infant-mother-father triads).

Such preparatory activity has been traditionally thought to lead to shorter reaction times by allowing the motor network to settle into states favourable to motor execution without directly engaging the peripheral musculature, limiting such preparatory states to central neural processes only. We revisited this question by recording motor unit related activity using high-density surface EMG grid electrodes, from the Anterior Deltoid muscle, a proximal muscle, during a delayed reach task. We observed that anodal stimulation of the supplementary motor area (SMA) enhances motor preparation by shortening reaction times, while simultaneously and preferentially recruiting smaller amplitude motor units. Additionally, we found that the SMA stimulation also produced a subsequent increase in movement velocities due to the increase activation of larger amplitude motor units. Taken together, we suggest that motor preparatory states involve an active interaction between central and peripheral processes with direct descending SMA outputs to the spinal cord providing a link between cortical preparation and muscle readiness, resulting in decreased reaction times. In addition, the increased gain of such central to peripheral interactions also increases the subsequent gain of during the execution phase via modulating larger amplitude motor unit activation, resulting in increased response vigour.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

The Caatinga, which is the largest seasonally dry tropical forest in South America, covers approximately 862,000 km2 in northeastern Brazil and supports millions of people. Unfortunately, its carbon dynamics has not been thoroughly quantified, especially after centuries of land-use transformation and wood extraction that have significantly diminished its biomass stocks. In this study, we model the potential aboveground biomass (AGB) that Caatinga could sustain under current climatic, atmospheric, and topographic conditions. We integrated data from 301 geo-referenced plots along with high-resolution environmental predictors. The principal Component Analysis revealed two main gradients: a hydro-thermal axis dominated by precipitation, temperature, and severity of drought, and a topographic axis reflecting slope, ruggedness, and terrain position. Random Forest models, validated through both random and spatial cross-validation, explained a significant amount of variation in AGB (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 21 Mg ha). Our findings indicated that AGB is highly sensitive to water availability. In particular, biomass increased sharply when the maximum cumulative water deficit (MCWD) was less than -500 mm and annual rainfall exceeded approximately 1,100 mm. In contrast, elevated vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were associated with reduced carbon storage. Topographic heterogeneity further influenced AGB, with rugged and concave terrains supporting potential biomass levels more than twice as high as those found in flat, convex areas. Our predictive map reveals a mosaic of low-biomass cores and localized high-biomass refugia, highlighting the dual influence of hydroclimatic and topographic factors.

Identifying non-additive interactions, or epistasis, at a higher-order could aid in filling this gap, but it is computationally difficult due to the massive search space involved. Current epistasis detection approaches struggle with non-cartesian higher order interactions and lack inherent explainability. We present a novel deep learning (DL) approach, EPIstasis Discovery with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (EPIK), a data-driven, modular, and symbolically representable framework. We also introduce a novel approach for higher-order XOR (a non-Cartesian type) interaction detection, utilized in EPIK's XOR detection module. EPIK slightly outperforms other DL approaches on simulated pure epistasis interactions benchmark in average F1 score. It outperforms other, general, traditional epistasis detection approaches on simulated mixed epistasis detection datasets and real-world GWAS datasets of Arabidopsis Thaliana. Finally, EPIK recovers a known gene interaction between MAPT and WNT3 for Parkinson's Disease (PD) while also suggesting a more complex interaction between MAPT, WNT3, and another gene, KANSL1.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Among these, quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models mechanistically simulate tumor progression and pharmacological interventions, enabling virtual clinical trials, model-informed drug development, and biomarker identification. Coupling QSP with an agent-based model yields a spatial QSP (spQSP) platform that captures tissue-level spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, parameterizing such models to represent tumor biology remains an open problem. In this study, we developed a calibration framework using the Approximate Bayesian Computation - Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) approach to calibrate the spQSP model with a combination of clinical and spatial molecular data, reflecting the TME characteristics of human tumors. This calibration framework matches tumor architectures between spQSP model predictions and patient spatial molecular data by fitting statistical summaries of cellular neighborhoods. We demonstrate that model calibration using CODEX data from untreated HCC patients enables prediction of TME spatial molecular states in an independent cohort receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) combination therapy. Finally, we identify spatial and non-spatial pretreatment biomarkers and assess their predictive power for therapeutic response. This workflow demonstrates how integrating spatial-omics with multiscale mechanistic models enables quantitative calibration, biological insight, and in silico biomarker discovery, providing a framework for personalized cancer therapy across tumor types.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "BackgroundAdjuvant immunotherapy has significantly improved survival for patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma, yet a fraction of patients will not benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). The tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in generating durable responses to ICI. By analyzing the cellular composition of tumor-associated subsets, key immune components essential for promoting an anti-tumor environment can be pinpointed. This will allow for both patient stratification and identification of biomarkers associated with improved patient outcome.\n\nMethodRegional lymph nodes were obtained from patients with stage III melanoma at surgery (n=29). Patients eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy (PD-1; pembrolizumab or nivolumab) received adjuvant treatment for up to one year. CyTOF was used to determine cellular composition in pre-treatment surgical specimens. Bulk gene expression data generated by NanoString from patients receiving surgery without adjuvant therapy (n=125) was implemented for evaluating trends observed in the CyTOF dataset.\n\nResultsAlthough no significant differences were observed across major hierarchical immune cell types between patients who developed distant metastasis after surgery and those that did not, an increased proportion of CD103+PD-1+CD8+ (TRM) T cells and plasmablast-like CD38hiCD19dim cells were associated with improved prognosis in the CyTOF cohort. In the untreated cohort, a subset of patients defined as \"Ultra-cold\" (< 2.5 % tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) scored by a pathologist) had significantly worse outcome than those with higher TIL infiltration. This Ultra-cold TIL group was associated with reduced B cell score, but not CD8+ T cell score, as well as reduced expression of activation genes like CD38.\n\nConclusionIn this study, CD103+PD-1+CD8+ (TRM) T cells and plasmablast-like CD38hiCD19dim cell populations were found to be strongly associated with prolonged distant metastasis-free survival in regional lymph nodes from patients with stage III melanoma treated with PD-1. This suggests an association between progression and infiltration of these cell types at baseline and highlights the potential of using immune cell subsets as prognostic biomarkers.\n\nWhat is already known on this topic - Patients being diagnosed with stage III melanoma will receive immune checkpoint inhibitors but will often be cured by surgery alone. Selection of which patients might benefit from treatment is still unresolved. Accurate biomarkers would aid in treatment stratification, to avoid overtreatment, and unnecessary toxicities.\n\nWhat this study adds - This study highlights how baseline CD103+PD-1+CD8+ (TRM) T cells and plasmablast-like CD38hiCD19dim cell populations in the regional lymph node, is strongly associated with improved outcome in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policy - The strong association between baseline plasmablast-like cell infiltration in RLN and prolonged distant metastasis free- survival, highlights this cell type as a potential treatment stratification criterion to identify patients with good prognosis.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence highlights that brain PUFAs are metabolized in oxylipins, the bioactive oxidized PUFA metabolites known to regulate inflammatory processes. Recent data highlighted that both PUFA and oxylipin profiles are modulated in the adult male brain by dietary PUFA content. However, little is known on the impact of maternal dietary n-3 PUFA intake during the perinatal period and the neurodevelopmental profile of brain fatty acids and associated oxylipins in offspring, and whether these effects differ between sexes. To address this question, we first measured fatty acid levels in the placenta and embryonic brain of male and female offspring of mothers fed a sufficient or deficient diet in n-3 PUFAs at embryonic day (E)17.5. Then, fatty acids and oxylipins were measured at different post-natal stages, in the brain at P0 and P7, and in the hippocampus at P14 and P21, in both male and female offspring. Our results show that maternal n-3 PUFA dietary deficiency alters fatty acid profiles as early as E17.5 in both the placenta and the brain. Furthermore, dietary intervention affects both fatty acid and oxylipin profiles throughout postnatal brain development, with notable sex-specific differences. These findings underscore the critical importance of adequate maternal n-3 PUFA intake during the perinatal period for maintaining an optimal PUFA and oxylipin profiles, with potential implications for fetal and postnatal brain development.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Accuracy improved on the hardest trials (Level 1) when a decoy was present, response times were slower in decoy conditions than baseline, and accuracy was higher for tall versus wide rectangles, consistent with the vertical-horizontal asymmetry. The relatively wide spacing of stimuli may have reduced grouping and attentional clustering; because spacing was not manipulated, this remains a hypothesis for future tests.

This approach revealed three trajectories: progression, stability, or regression, and enabled dissection of the immune dynamics underlying each fate. Lesion outcome was dictated by the spatial organization of myeloid-derived antigen-presenting cells: regressing lesions were characterized by dense clusters of myeloid-derived cells associated with CXCL9+/CXCL10+ expression and T cell recruitment, whereas progressing lesions displayed sparse, non-clustered infiltration. Remarkably, transient myeloid clusters arose prior to any detectable lesion formation and consistently marked regions that would later develop into premalignant lesions.

Here we show that pre-implantation treatment of mouse pregnancy with indomethacin, an NSAID that inhibits both PTGS1 and PTGS2, results in embryo crowding, delayed embryo implantation, defective implantation chamber formation that eventually results in significant pregnancy loss. These effects are dose dependent as lower doses of indomethacin do not show these effects on pregnancy. When embryo spacing defects were observed, a significant proportion of embryos that showed delayed growth or resorption were located in distinct decidual sites, suggesting that additional mechanisms beyond spatial distribution are at play.

S.; Reddy, G.", "abstract": "Single-cell experiments in yeast reveal two distinct heritable phenotypes - `arresters' and `recoverers' - when a clonal population experiences a negative shift in its growth environment. Recoverers exhibit a variable yet finite lag before resuming growth in the new environment, whereas arresters remain in a non-growing, arrested state until more favorable conditions return. Although the diversification of individual cells into arresters and recoverers is a robust phenomenon, it remains unclear whether this coexistence constitutes an evolutionarily stable strategy. Here, we demonstrate that a heterogeneous strategy composed of both arrester and recoverer phenotypes maximizes long-term population fitness across a broad spectrum of growth-lag trade-offs. Our analysis employs a dynamic programming framework to identify the fitness-maximizing distribution of phenotypes for populations that stochastically switch between preferred and non-preferred environments. We propose a minimal model incorporating metabolism, growth, and enzyme allocation to explain the physiological origin of a power-law growth-lag trade-off that favors phenotypic heterogeneity. The theory predicts a nontrivial relationship between the fraction of recoverers and their lag time, which aligns with existing data from wild yeast strains, evolved isolates, and variations in pre-shift growth conditions. This relationship suggests an evolutionary `rheostat'-like mechanism that enables populations to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Owing to this unifying and predictive capacity, such bifurcations are attracting growing interest in mathematical biology, particularly in neuroscience. One notable example is the codimension-3 Degenerate Takens-Bogdanov (DTB) singularity, proposed as an organizing center for neural dynamics at both the single-neuron and population levels and playing a key role in bursting. The DTB itself arises within the unfolding of an even higher-order singularity, the Doubly Degenerate Takens-Bogdanov (DDTB), whose structure remains only partially understood, despite initial indications of its relevance in systems exhibiting a DTB point. Here, we contribute by employing numerical continuation to explore the DDTB unfolding using concentric spheres in parameter space. We confirm the conjecture that it connects DTB to another highly symmetric codimension-3 bifurcation, but through transitions that differ in part from those previously proposed in the literature, with one intermediate passage remaining unclear. We also show that using planes, rather than spheres, to explore the unfolding allows for additional bifurcation topologies. Overall, the intermediate configurations and additional bifurcation structures reveal a rich repertoire of dynamical behaviors that improve our understanding of what models with a DDTB point can do and how these behaviors are related.

Despite being the target of all anti-seizure therapies, its underlying mechanisms and dynamics remain incompletely understood Methods: We employed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously monitor excitatory CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) and either parvalbumin-(PV) or somatostatin-expressing (SST) inhibitory interneurons (INs) during seizure onset in acute 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and chronic kainate models of temporal lobe epilepsy. Results: Acute seizures exhibited two distinct initiation patterns: an INs-first pattern, in which activation of interneurons preceded that of pyramidal neurons, and a simultaneous PNs-INs pattern, characterized by concurrent activation of both populations. Remarkably, individual mice often alternated between these two initiation modes across different seizures. In contrast, spontaneous seizures in the chronic KA model consistently displayed only the simultaneous PNs-INs initiation pattern. Optogenetic activation of PNs, PV-INs, or SST-INs, as well as chemogenetic inhibition of INs, each elicited pro-ictogenic effects, reinforcing the concept of dual initiation pathways in which seizures may be triggered by activation of either excitatory or inhibitory neuronal populations. At seizure onset in both models, inter-neuronal synchronization reliably exceeded that of pyramidal neurons. Moreover, the recruitment sequence of PNs, and to a lesser extent INs, was highly stereotyped across seizures, suggesting the existence of a conserved and robust seizure initiation circuit.

We identified the pxpTABC gene cluster as being essential for growth on 5-OP. The pxpT gene encodes a secondary transporter of the APC superfamily which most likely catalyzes 5-OP uptake into the cell. The pxpABC genes encode a recently identified ATP-dependent 5-oxoprolinase that converts 5-OP into L-glutamate for further metabolism. Both PxpT and PxpABC were required for growth with 5-OP. Upstream and divergent to pxpT, the gene pxpR is located, encoding a GntR-type transcriptional regulator. Deletion of pxpR improved growth on 5-OP suggesting that PxpR acts as repressor of the pxpTABC operon. This function was further supported by reporter gene studies. Purified PxpR was shown by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to bind 5-OP with a KD of 726 {+/-} 23 nM.

During infection, ubiquitination is crucial in regulating host cell signaling pathways in pathogen recognition, clearance and mounting an efficient immune response. S. aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that is able to invade and multiply within both phagocytic and non-phagocytic mammalian cells depending on virulence factor expression of the respective S. aureus strain. Selective autophagy serves as a host defense mechanism to combat intracellular bacterial persistence by targeting and degrading intracellular pathogens. However, S. aureus can subvert autophagosomal degradation and exploit these organelles for intracellular replication. We examined the role of the E3 ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), a component of the SKP1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) - complex, during S. aureus infection in alveolar epithelial and in macrophage-like cells. Upon S. aureus infection, we demonstrate increased SKP2 abundance through acetylation-induced stabilization and translocation into the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic SKP2 modulated autophagy induction. By downregulation of SKP2, the level of the autophagy marker LC3-II was elevated which was accompanied by increased survival of intracellular S. aureus. Conversely, SKP2 overexpression in host cells reduced LC3-II levels followed by reduced intracellular bacteria. These findings underscore that SKP2 is an important regulator of autophagy, preventing excessive autophagy from being exploited by S. aureus.

M.; Shang, G.; Wang, Q.; Xie, H.; Demireva, E. Y.; Sun, L.; Ding, D.; Chen, C.", "abstract": "Pachytene piRNAs are the least understood class of piRNAs in the mammalian male germ line. During meiosis, their biogenesis occurs near mitochondrial outer membrane in germ granules known as intermitochondrial cement (IMC). However, how mitochondrial factors regulate the trafficking of PIWI proteins into and out of the IMC remain poorly understood. Here we show that the cytoplasmic PIWI proteins MILI and MIWI are recruited for pachytene piRNA biogenesis via distinct mitochondrial membrane proteins. Loss of the mitochondrial scaffold protein ASZ1 during meiosis in mice disrupts multiple downstream biogenesis steps, leading to misregulation of MILI and MIWI, failure of IMC formation, and a near-complete loss of mature pachytene piRNAs. Strikingly, despite the drastic depletion of pachytene piRNAs, LINE1 transposon silencing remains unaffected. We identify three classes of pachytene piRNA pathway components that coordinate piRNA production and compartmentalization. Our findings reveal that chromatoid body precursors serve as a central hub for the accumulation of pachytene PIWI-piRNA complexes, thus establishing a connection between IMC-based biogenesis and downstream piRNA function.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Using Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS), environmental DNA (eDNA), metabarcoding (COI, 18S), image analysis, and 1-km hydrodynamic models, we investigated the mechanisms structuring cryptobenthic metazoan communities across six mesophotic banks on the northwestern Texas-Louisiana continental shelf. Community composition was governed primarily by environmental filtering: depth and turbidity jointly explained nearly twice as much variance than geographic effects in ARMS metabarcoding datasets. Environmental distance predicted community dissimilarity up to tenfold better than geographic distance, and environmental coefficients were 5-15 times larger than geographic ones in multiple regression models. Turbidity, shaped by the benthic nepheloid layer, was the dominant filter, influencing 57 % of COI phyla and 115 families in 18S data, favoring sediment-tolerant suspension feeders and excluding photoautotrophs. Depth effects, although significant, were weaker and taxon-specific. Hydrodynamic simulations revealed episodic, bidirectional connectivity among banks with low connection strengths, indicating variable but non-limiting dispersal. Residual spatial structure likely reflects stochastic dispersal and spatially structured habitat heterogeneity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that environmental filtering, dominated by turbidity, overrides dispersal limitation in shaping mesophotic cryptobenthic communities, identifying the nepheloid layer as a key physical driver linking shelf oceanography, biodiversity, and ecosystem function. Suspended particle dynamics associated with bottom nepheloid layers merit integration into conservation planning as important mediators of ecological connectivity in mesophotic and other patchy reef systems globally.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

While Bap1 has been shown to play key roles in metabolism, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and immune cell development, little is known about its normal functions in the liver in vivo. This study aims to identify Bap1 specific effects on the liver's immune microenvironment and biological functions. Methods: Using AAV8-mediated CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing we generated a mouse hepatocyte-specific model of Bap1 knockout to define the changes that occur in liver biology in an in vivo system and characterize how loss of Bap1 alters the liver's response to injury. Single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics were performed in conjunction with immunohistochemistry to analyze cell-type composition and immune cell recruitment changes. Bulk RNA-sequencing was performed for further assessment of the impact of Bap1 loss on transcription. Results: Hepatocyte-specific depletion of Bap1 induced transcriptional changes shared with acute injury. We observed a strong dysregulation of inflammatory pathways associated with BAP1 loss. Moreover, the transcriptional response of Bap1 depletion in hepatocytes to damage was markedly different than in control liver, with Bap1-deleted livers showing a decreased hepatocyte identity based on gene expression. Spatial transcriptomics and quantitative texture analysis of immunohistochemistry revealed an altered immune environment prior to damage and an impaired recruitment of immune cells in Bap1 depleted livers after damage. Conclusions: Using a hepatocyte-specific Bap1 deletion we identified Bap1 as a critical modulator in the liver's immune cell response. We show that Bap1 loss leads to an inflammatory environment prior to damage and disrupts the recruitment immune cells. Our quantitative spatial analysis highlights the power of such approaches to characterize the spatial distribution of different cell types in a tissue.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Despite extensive knowledge of sex-biased transcriptomes, the functional cis-regulatory elements orchestrating these sex differences in liver metabolic function are largely uncharacterized. We employed an integrative approach combining single nucleus (sn) multiOmics with in vivo functional enhancer profiling using HDI-STARR-seq to identify and validate GH-responsive, sex-biased enhancers in mouse liver. We profiled ~1,000 differentially accessible regions (DARs) from male, female, and continuous GH-infused (cGH) male livers by snATAC-seq + snRNA-seq, linking chromatin accessibility to sex-biased gene expression. A tiled STARR-seq library comprised of 23,912 unique reporters spanning 1,839 ATAC regions was delivered to mouse liver by hydrodynamic injection (HDI), which enabled functional assessment of enhancer activity under physiologically relevant conditions and with minimal immune response. We identified 4,126 robust active reporters, of which 1,397, representing 840 distinct ATAC regions, showed sex-biased and/or GH-regulated activity, with strong positive correlations between chromatin accessibility and functional enhancer activity. Regulated enhancer regions were significantly enriched for activating histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K27ac) and binding sites for key transcription factors including STAT5, BCL6, HNF4, and CUX2. Further, de novo motif analysis revealed sex-specific transcription factor binding patterns discriminating regulated from non-regulated enhancers. Finally, many of the functionally active sex-biased, cGH-responsive genes were linked to MASLD-enabling or MASLD-protective sex-biased genes.

This disorder results from deficient colonization of fetal intestine by enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDCs). HSCR exhibits complex, multifactorial inheritance with penetrance and severity varying widely even within a family. SOX10 is among causal genes that predispose to aganglionosis. Yet, how gene interactions influence severity of HSCR aganglionosis is not understood. We previously used an F1-intercross strategy to map genetic modifiers of aganglionosis in the Sox10Dom HSCR mouse. Here we employ an extended pedigree mapping approach and complementary omics analyses of the developing Enteric Nervous System (ENS) to identify modifier loci that affect severity of HSCR aganglionosis. Results To identify loci that modify aganglionosis extent we undertook genome-wide association study (GWAS) of an extended pedigree of Sox10Dom mice on a mixed C57BL/6J x C3HeBFeJLe-a/a background. GWAS uncovered genetic modifiers of aganglionosis severity in this cohort. Within each modifier interval, we prioritize candidate genes based on gene expression in the developing ENS, proximity to open chromatin regions in ENCDCs, and presence of conserved SOX10 binding motifs. This strategy identified known genes in ENS development as well as multiple novel genes. Dach1 emerged as a top priority gene for modifying ENCDCs migration and thus influencing aganglionosis severity.

Despite advances in understanding the pathogenesis of PCD, diagnosis continues to be challenging. Here we used feature-based machine learning and image-based deep learning to objectively quantify the directed particle transport of motile cilia and detect PCD-related cilia dysfunction. Methods. Fluorescent microspheres were captured on cultured multiciliated cells using high-speed video microscopy as a proxy for motile cilia function. An interactive Jython script was designed to automatically detect, track and extract raw track metrics from videos. Data was subsequently analyzed to approximate a quantifiable and visual signature of ciliary transport through a custom-built Python Package, CiliaTracks. Results. Airway epithelial cells were obtained from 14 individuals with genetically confirmed PCD, 10 healthy donors, and 2 patients with cystic fibrosis. A total of 602 videos (301 PCD and 301 non-PCD) were captured. Quantitative and visual analyses of fluorescent microsphere trajectories, including kinematic metrics and trajectory plots, revealed distinct motility profiles between PCD and non-PCD samples. Classical machine learning models and a convolutional neural network were employed to classify PCD using both modalities, demonstrating excellent accuracy of 95-97%, and the capacity to differentiate PCD from normal cells or cystic fibrosis.

Likewise, Lamin B1 downregulation has been observed in GC-derived lymphomas and myeloid malignancies, yet the functional consequences of Lamin B1 loss during B cell development remain poorly understood. Here, we used in vivo and in vitro B cell models of conditional hypomorphic expression of Lamin B1, which showed elevated DNA damage, altered chromatin accessibility, and disrupted transcriptional profiles. Using sBLISS (in situ labelling and sequencing of double-strand breaks), we identified non-random double-strand break hotspots in both mouse and human GC B cells, depleted of Lamin B1. These breaks are preferentially located near transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and regulatory elements that control translation and mRNA fate, implicating Lamin B1 in protecting fragile regulatory regions.

Dysregulated transcriptional regulation plays a pivotal role in driving blast crisis progression. In this study, we performed histone modification and transcriptomic high-throughput sequencing on bone marrow cells derived from chronic and blast-phase CML patients, identifying a CML blast-specific transcriptional regulatory circuit comprising MEF2C, MYB, MEIS1, and ZEB2. These transcription factors (TFs) form protein complexes that co-bind to shared enhancers or promoters, reciprocally enhancing each other's transcriptional activity and that of their downstream targets. Mechanistically, this circuit synergistically reprograms chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscapes in blast cells, parallel activation of purine metabolism and Rho GTPase signaling pathways which exhibit functional crosstalk. Functional validation demonstrated that silencing components of this circuit or its downstream core targets significantly suppressed CML blast progression in vitro and in vivo. Notably, mebendazole (MBZ), a clinically approved inhibitor targeting MYB protein stability, recapitulated these inhibitory effects.

GCS overexpression is a cause of drug resistance and enriches cancer stem cells (CSCs) during cancer chemotherapy. Previous studies showed that GCS modulates expression of p53 mutants and oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) in heterozygous knock-in cell models (TP53 R273H-/+). However, it is unclear whether GCS can modulate the effects of homozygous p53 mutations, which are common in many cancer cases. We report herewith that inhibition of GCS, via UGCG-knockout and using new inhibitor (Genz-161), effectively re-sensitizes drug resistance and diminishes CSCs in colon cancer cells carrying the homozygous p53 R273H mutation. In aggressive WiDr cells carrying TP53 R273H mutation, knockout of UGCG gene using CRISPR/Cas9 editing or inhibition of GCS with Genz-161 sensitized cancer cells to oxaliplatin, irinotecan and paclitaxel. With decreased ceramide glycosylation in lipidomic profiling, both UGCG-knockout and Genz-161 treatments substantially decreased wound healing, and diminished CSCs and tumor growth under chemotherapy. Interestingly, inhibition of RNA m6A methylation by neplanocin A reactivated p53 function and reversed drug resistance. Mechanistic investigation revealed that GCS inhibition downregulated METTL3 expression and repressed RNA-m6A modification on mutant p53 R273H effects. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that ceramide glycosylation promotes METTL3 expression and RNA m6A methylation in response to drug-induced stress, thereby promoting mutant p53 expression and associated GOF. Conversely, inhibition of GCS can diminish CSCs and drug resistance via reduction of m6A modification and reactivation of p53 function.

Understanding both the similarities and differences in these mechanisms is important to guide the development of new, targeted interventions. Methods: 255 participants diagnosed with MDD (n=54), BP (n=47), SCZ (n=67) or without any diagnoses (CTRL; n=87) performed an associative learning task. Computational modeling quantified the mechanistic interplay between working memory (WM) and reinforcement learning (RL). The latent RL and WM signatures in the EEG dynamics showed shared and distinct neurocognitive mechanisms underlying learning. Results: All clinical groups showed learning impairments at the behavioral level. Model-based EEG analyses linked these impairments to distinct patterns in the dynamic interplay between latent RL and WM mechanisms, contrasting with the typical patterns observed in CTRL. SCZ was characterized by reduced neural markers of WM, weakening the cooperative influence of WM onto RL (reduced WM recruitment), and reduced integration of negative feedback. Conversely, MDD was characterized by reduced reciprocal influence of RL onto WM, reducing the tendency to upregulate WM contribution with reward history (impaired WM management). Finally, BP was characterized by deficits in both WM and RL recruitment, along with higher WM decay. Conclusions: Behavioral learning impairments that appear similar across clinical groups can be linked to distinct neurocognitive mechanisms via integrative neurocomputational modeling.

One of these proteins, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), is involved in mediating structural and functional changes after activity. While postsynaptic CaMKII translation has been studied, very little is known about presynaptic synthesis, including its mechanisms and the functional consequences. We utilized the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model to study the molecular requirements for activity-dependent synthesis along with the localization of CaMKII protein. Presynaptic-specific tagging of endogenous CaMKII demonstrates that spaced stimulation rapidly increases presynaptic CaMKII through local translation of pre-existing mRNA, independently of somatic factors. This activity-dependent synthesis requires the distal 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the CaMKII mRNA, which is also necessary for steady-state synaptic accumulation. Additionally, we show that activity-dependent synthesis requires CaMKII T287 autophosphorylation-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway. While activity-dependent redistribution of CaMKII has been previously identified, very little is known about how local synthesis and translocation may interact to define different pools of protein that may have distinct functions. We demonstrate that CaMKII with a T287D phosphomimetic mutant localizes to the synaptic membrane and pulse-chase experiments show that the localization of newly-synthesized CaMKII differs from pre-existing CaMKII, indicating neuronal activity generates spatially distinct, and likely functionally distinct, CaMKII populations which may underlie long-lasting plasticity.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

To define molecular drivers of metastasis in non-MYCN amplified neuroblastoma and identify putative prognostic markers, we leveraged our validated in vivo chick embryo xenograft model to profile oxygen-sensitive transcriptional changes, revealing a cohort of ~400 genes associated with metastatic competence. Integrative survival analysis using two independent patient cohorts identified 59 genes predictive of event-free survival in non-MYCN amplified disease. Among these, the poorly characterized Zinc Finger DHHC-Type Palmitoyltransferase 23 (zDHHC23) emerged as a robust prognostic candidate. Proteomic interrogation of zDHHC23 under varying oxygen conditions uncovered dynamic interactome remodelling, notably hypoxia-attenuated association with the 26S proteasome and the TIM23 mitochondrial import complex.

Aperiodic activity forms the 1/f-like background of the EEG power spectrum and can be characterised by parameters describing the offset and slope (1/f exponent). Evidence from computational modelling and GABAergic drug studies suggests that increased inhibitory input steepens this slope. This study examined the effects of two antiseizure medications (ASMs) that reduce cortical excitability through different mechanism of action on aperiodic EEG activity. Resting EEG was recorded with eyes open and closed from 13 healthy male volunteers at baseline and two hours after administration of lamotrigine (300 mg), levetiracetam (3000 mg), or placebo. Power spectra were computed using Welch's method and aperiodic parameters estimated with the specparam algorithm. In the eyes-open condition, lamotrigine significantly reduced the aperiodic offset from pre- to post-dose (p = 0.022) and relative to placebo (p = 0.0032), indicating lower broadband power at low frequencies. No significant changes in slope were found under either condition during eyes-closed, and levetiracetam produced no measurable effects on any parameter. These findings indicate that aperiodic metrics may capture specific neurophysiological mechanisms, with lamotrigine producing a broadband reduction in EEG power consistent with its suppression of cortical excitability via sodium channel blockade.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Chronic activation of the Integrated Stress Response is linked to Alzheimer disease, typically through eIF2alpha phosphorylation, which selectively enhances translation of key stress-responsive mRNAs like ATF4 and BACE1. We investigated a novel regulatory mechanism mediated by Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), a hyperactive kinase in Alzheimer disease, on the translational factor eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2. We treated human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) with a GSK-3beta inhibitor (NP031112) or overexpressed a constitutively active GSK-3beta mutant (GSK-3beta-S9A) on HEK cells to modulate GSK-3beta activity. GSK-3beta inhibition significantly reduced ATF4 and BACE1 protein levels in SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner as we tested by western blot (P<0.001), independent of eIF2alpha phosphorylation. This effect was translational, as the inhibitor still reduced BACE1 levels when transcription was blocked. Crucially, NP031112 reversed stress-induced eIF2Bepsilon phosphorylation at Ser540 (P<0.001). Furthermore, H2O2-induced Abeta1-42 secretion by SH-SY5Y cells was significantly reversed by GSK-3beta inhibition (P<0.001). Luciferase reporter assays using the BACE1 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) confirmed that both eIF2Bepsilon silencing and a phosphomimetic mutant eIF2Bepsilon-S540E increased BACE1 5' UTR-driven translation (P<0.001), demonstrating that reduced functional eIF2B enhances BACE1 translation. Finally, immunohistofluorescence and western blot analysis of human AD hippocampi confirmed the translational link, showing a significant increase in pS540-eIF2Bepsilon, ATF4, and BACE1 levels in AD patients compared to non-demented controls (P<0.001 for all three). Our findings establish a novel GSK-3beta-eIF2Bepsilon-BACE1 axis that links stress response dysregulation to amyloidogenesis, independent of canonical eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of eIF2Bepsilon functionally mimics the effects of eIF2alpha phosphorylation by reducing the available functional eIF2B pool, thereby reprogramming translation to favour the production of stress proteins like ATF4 and BACE1. Based on our results, we proposed that eIF2Bepsilon phosphorylation is a key etiological mechanism in Alzheimer disease.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Levels of phosphorylated ribosomal S6 protein (PS6; Ser240/244), a marker for mTOR activation, were defined via Western blotting in vitro. Timelapse live-cell imaging was used to observe aggregate formation, with or without mTORC1 inhibition (rapamycin). EdU-base cell proliferation assay and cell death assays were performed to determine whether aggregation was the result of changes in cell cycle or increased cell death. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to define changes in the cell aggregate proteome. Human MCD brain tissue specimens were stained with PS6 to assay mTOR signaling in neuronal clusters. All knockout lines formed multi-cell aggregates compared to control lines within 24-48 hours of plating in vitro. Aggregation was abolished with mTOR inhibitor treatment, establishing the mTOR-dependency of aggregate formation. Aggregation was not driven by cell proliferation, apoptosis/necrosis, or the presence of extracellular DNA in culture media. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed altered expression of protein across KO lines including adhesion molecules (e.g., contactin-3), cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., stathmin-2), and protein processing/transport (e.g., Uevld). Our findings establish aberrant cellular aggregation as an mTOR-dependent phenotype across multiple MPG associated with MCD. Changes in expression of adhesion molecules may contribute to abnormal cell aggregation and cortical lamination in MCD and results in abnormal network formation that leads to seizures.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

C.; Ehrhard, E.; Dickinson, M. H.; Beatus, T.; Cowan, N.; Cohen, I.", "abstract": "Flapping flight is inherently unstable, requiring Drosophila to fine-tune their wing motions on a milliseconds timescale. Pioneering studies have shown that the direct steering muscles, which attach to the wing hinge, are important for generating these rapid flight reflexes. Recent connectome data, however, reveal that indirect steering muscles or tension muscles, which alter the mechanics of the thorax, receive some of the same synaptic inputs from the sensory apparatus as the direct steering muscles. This discovery suggests that the indirect steering muscles may also be important for flight control. Here, we show that the indirect tergopleural muscles indeed contribute substantially to stabilization, particularly for large pitch perturbations. We find that for small perturbations (less than 1000 deg/s), flies modulate their wing stroke amplitude to generate lift-based corrective torques, a strategy that has been previously documented. For larger perturbations, however, we observe that Drosophila engage an additional wing degree of freedom-the wing pitch angle-to leverage additional lift and drag forces during the corrective maneuver. Quasi-steady aerodynamic simulations reveal that this strategy minimizes power consumption, anaolgous to how some mammals (including humans) adjust their steady-state gaits in a near energyoptimal manner. Using optogenetics and a control theory framework we demonstrate that the tergopleural muscle is activated by a proportional gain component of a nonlinear PI controller responsible for determining the wing pitch angle during large perturbations. A simplified torsional-spring model for the wing hinge captures the changes in the wing pitch dynamics observed during correction maneuvers by using the tergopleural muscle to adjust the rest angle of the wing. These findings provide a striking example of reflex strategy selection in time-critical behaviors and underscores the vital role of indirect steering muscles in flight stabilization.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Developing effective adjunctive interventions to restore immune balance is therefore essential. This study investigated the immunomodulatory potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived culture-conditioned media (CCM) from naive and preconditioned MSCs-hypoxic (MSCsHYP), apoptotic (MSCsAPO), and dual preconditioned (MSCsHYP+APO) in aGVHD. Methods: Human MSCs isolated from bone marrow and Wharton's Jelly were preconditioned under hypoxia (1% O2), apoptosis (1  staurosporine, 24 h), or both. The immunoregulatory and antioxidant properties of their CCM were evaluated through T-cell proliferation assays, Treg induction, macrophage polarization, mitochondrial function, and T-cell bioenergetics. Comparative proteomic profiling of CCM from WJ-MSCs and WJ-MSCsHYP+APO co-cultured with aGVHD patient-derived activated PBMNCs was performed using LC-MS/MS, alongside in vivo validation in a chemotherapy-induced aGVHD murine model. Results: WJ-MSCsHYP+APO-CCM exhibited superior immunomodulatory efficacy, suppressing T-cell proliferation, promoting Treg and Th2/Th9 differentiation, and driving M2 macrophage polarization. It reduced mitochondrial ROS, enhanced mitochondrial polarization, and shifted T-cell metabolism from glycolysis toward oxidative phosphorylation. Proteomic analysis revealed modulation of IL-12, IL-17, and JAK-STAT pathways, along with regulation of complement, coagulation, and metabolic cascades. Interaction with immune cells further enhanced its antioxidant and tissue-reparative properties via extracellular matrix remodeling. Conclusion: Dual preconditioning under hypoxia and apoptosis amplifies the immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and reparative efficacy of WJ-MSCs-CCM, offering a potent non-cellular therapeutic strategy for aGVHD management.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

How the parasite disseminates within the host remains largely unresolved. It is clear however, that parasite motility plays a central role. The unicellular, eukaryotic flagellate is a versatile microswimmer, like bacteria or sperm cells, albeit structurally far more complex. In addition to possessing a flagellum attached alongside a strongly polarised cell body, the parasite is capable of swimming both forwards and backwards. The trypanosome must be capable of navigating effectively even under extreme physical and mechanical constraints. This means that the cell is mechanically adapted to motion in diverse challenging microenvironments. To address how, we study the parasites in different viscoelastic regimes up to conditions mimicking tissue confinement. Next to quantitative high speed video microscopy, we employ digital holography microscopy, yielding three-dimensional subcellular resolution. We detail the mechanical reaction of the flexible cell body with its uniquely attached flagellum to increasing confinement and show how the trypanosomes are able to maintain their motile capabilities to spread in dense tissue.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Sorghum is a drought-tolerant crop native to Africa cultivated by hundreds of millions of smallholders globally. Here we examined the ecological context of population-genomic structure of 1,806 sorghum landraces across Africa and Eurasia to infer the relative contribution of environmental and cultural factors to sorghum genetic diversity across different relative time periods. Sorghum landraces were spatially and linguistically structured at a large-scale and within subregions, following a pattern of isolation by distance. Within regions, much of genomic structure was best explained by a mechanistic model of human travel time. In our assessment of hierarchical linguistic structure, we found that language families explain 4% of genomic variation while individual languages explain 13% of genomic variation, suggesting the importance of human culture and relationships in gene flow and selection. Variance partitioning showed that travel time, language, and climate explain up to 27% of genomic variation among landraces. We also observed regional differences in the degree of genetic relatedness across space and time in our assessment of shared ancestry. East Africa showed particularly strong geographic turnover in genomic composition and haplotype sharing, while West Africa showed substantial haplotype sharing even over large distances, signifying some rapidly spreading lineages. Thus, space, travel time, and culture likely capture important forces controlling sorghum genomic variation, but these factors operate heterogeneously over space.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Using human brain organoids cultured aboard the International Space Station, we analyzed three independent spaceflights to demonstrate that exposure to the space environment triggers Space Induced Neural Senescence (SINS), characterized by chromatin remodeling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of viral-like transcriptional programs in the absence of infection. Multiomics analyses identified upregulation of endogenous LINE-1 (L1) retroelements, whose activity was markedly enhanced in organoids lacking MECP2, a known L1 repressor implicated in Rett syndrome. The resulting accumulation of cytoplasmic L1 DNA elicited an IL6 mediated inflammatory and neurotoxic response, which was reversed by reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTi) such as lamivudine or stavudine. Parallel preclinical experiments in Mecp2-deficient mice confirmed that RTi treatment restored neuronal morphology, synaptogenesis, function, cognition, and survival. These findings reveal that the space environment reactivates dormant genomic retroelements, providing an unexpected mechanistic insight into astronaut neurobiology and identifying a potential therapeutic strategy for both space-induced and terrestrial neurological conditions.

To address this challenge, large-scale neural activity datasets with increased resolution and wider coverage have become more prevalent across many model systems. However, bridging the gap in scale between changes in pairwise functional connectivity between neurons and changes in brain-wide organization of activity remains a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate application of modularity-based community detection and network modularity to single-cell resolved recordings, for the first time, as a method to summarize complex changes in time-varying functional connectivity, facilitating comparisons across multiple time windows, recordings, and conditions. We apply these methods to both single-cell resolved multi-cell and whole-brain activity recordings. In the multi-cell recordings, we find that food odor changes functional connectivity between existing network modules in a C. elegans locomotory interneuron network, rather than reorganizing them. In spontaneous whole-brain activity, we identify several key hub neurons and combinations that significantly destabilize module assignments when silenced. Together, these results demonstrate community detection and modularity as a method for detecting context and network state-dependent changes in functional connectivity at the intermediate scale of network modules in single-cell resolved neural activity. Results from these analyses facilitate future investigation of mechanisms that mediate organization of neural activity at intermediate scales.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Multivariate pattern analysis shows that encoding histories leave distinct neural signatures even when behavioral performances is equivalent. Encoding history could be decoded by classifiers from recognition activity across the ventral visual stream and higher-order regions. Category-based encoding reduced item-specific reinstatement in perceptual regions, while item-based encoding modified cross-phase item-level similarity in the anterior temporal lobe, suggesting a transition from detailed to integrative conceptual representations.

F.; Schneider, P.", "abstract": "The emergence of evolutionary novelties remains a central challenge in biology, particularly for complex organs such as the vertebrate eye. While visual systems have repeatedly undergone degeneration or loss, examples of innovation are rare and poorly understood. Mechanistic insight into such gains requires tractable systems in which novel visual functions have evolved. Here we leverage the four-eyed fish Anableps anableps to uncover the cellular and molecular basis of adaptation to simultaneous aerial and aquatic light. Combining single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics, we show that the Anableps ventral retina has been developmentally and functionally reconfigured for aerial vision. In fully aquatic teleosts such as zebrafish, ventral photoreceptors are tuned to red-shifted, downwelling light. In contrast, we show that Anableps exhibits an expanded and diversified ventral cone population encompassing ultraviolet-, blue-, green-, and red-sensitive types, enabling broad-spectrum, high-intensity vision from above water. To estimate Anableps opsin spectral properties, we employed OPTICS, a machine-learning model of opsin spectral tuning, which predicts that the ventrally expressed opn1mw2 opsin is red-shifted relative to typical green-sensitive pigments. Analysis of dorsal-ventral patterning markers reveals an overrepresentation of ventral retinal cell types. Consistent with this, comparative spatial transcriptomic profiling of developing and adult Anableps and the killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) indicates a dorsal displacement of the dorsal-ventral boundary in Anableps, resulting in a proportionally larger ventral retinal domain. Collectively, our results reveal that Anableps achieved its unique dual visual capacity by developmentally expanding and functionally reprogramming the ventral retina for aerial light detection, an evolutionary innovation that redefines how retinal domains can adapt to radically different visual environments.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Mechanistic studies indicate that mitotic bypass is dependent on CDK1 inhibition by WEE1 and Myt1, which prevents entry into mitosis and induces premature APC/C activation during G2 arrest. Disrupting WEE1 or Myt1 activity using clinical-stage small molecule inhibitors promotes CDK1 reactivation, forcing mitotic entry, catastrophe, and cell death.

However, over half of bird species have a cumulative sample size of fewer than 20 individuals, leading to a limited understanding of the global patterns and mechanisms of their susceptibility to avian malaria. Our aim is to use interpretable machine learning to identify the global ecological and evolutionary drivers shaping species level avian malaria susceptibility in birds. Location: Global. Time period: From 1994 to 2023. Major taxa studied: Global bird species and their malaria parasites (genus Plasmodium). Methods: Based on infection data and traits from 72,406 birds of 2,544 species worldwide, we developed an interpretable machine learning (IML) approach to identify the global drivers of species level susceptibility and their trends. We further applied our model to predict the susceptibility of bird species with a sample size of less than 30 and tested multiple hypotheses related to differences in parasite susceptibility in birds. Results: Our model distinguished susceptible birds with moderate accuracy (F1 score 0.72) and predicted 752 bird species to be highly susceptible to avian malaria, including 16 threatened species. Susceptibility showed a moderate but significant phylogenetic signal, with most susceptible species belonging to Passeriformes. Highly susceptible species were generally characterized by larger body size, omnivory, ground foraging behavior, wider geographic ranges, and medium diversification rates. Main Conclusions: We show that ecological and evolutionary factors together shape species level susceptibility of birds to avian malaria. Interpretable machine learning integrating host traits offers a global insights into infection mechanisms and supports the development of more precise surveillance and control strategies.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

The genetic analysis of century-old aquatic animal specimens, mostly preserved in ethanol, can provide valuable insights into the changes in genetic diversity caused by anthropogenic impacts. However, knowledge of the characteristics of degraded DNA from such specimens remains limited. In this study, we evaluated the DNA quality of bitterling fish, Tanakia lanceolata (Temminck and Schlegel), collected during the Vega Expedition in Japan in 1879 and preserved in ethanol. We then performed genomic analysis to test its hypothesized translocation-involved population history. The historical DNA was degraded, peaking around 50 bp, but a minor fraction exceeded 300 bp. Mitochondrial genetic analysis revealed high genetic similarity between the eastern and western sides of the Central Highland, typically impeding the dispersal of primary freshwater fish. These findings suggest an unexpected dispersal ability in T. lanceolata or undocumented translocations before the large-scale domestic translocations recorded since the 1910s. The customized workflow for historical ethanol-preserved specimens, based on historical DNA quality in this study, provides a foundation for studying historical archives.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

We demonstrated the Captamer for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein detection and obtained results from samples within 30 min, displaying a wide detection window from 0.2 pg/mL to 200 pg/mL with high specificity. Furthermore, we tested the Captamer for Tau441 protein (a potential Alzheimer's disease biomarker) and thrombin (a classic aptamer-protein interaction model), showing the limit of detection as low as 1 ng/mL and 0.02pg/mL respectively, which suggested the capacity of Captamer to be applied to various aptamer-protein pairs.

Using EvoPRAISE, we designed peptide binders that interact with Ly6E, a BBB-associated membrane protein expressed in the Syrian hamster brain. By inserting these peptides into surface-exposed regions of the AAV9 capsid, we developed AAV capsid variants capable of crossing the BBB following systemic administration in Syrian hamsters. Furthermore, this framework enabled the design of AAV capsids displaying peptide binders targeting the human BBB. This rational approach reduces the need for large-scale animal in vivo selection procedures and facilitates the efficient development of receptor-targeted AAV capsids for both neuroscience studies in non-model species and translational gene delivery to the human brain.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Despite lactate's abundance in biofluids, lactate-based EBFCs remain underexplored, particularly on scalable electrode platforms. Here, we report the first lactate/oxygen EBFC fabricated on laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes prepared by direct laser writing. The bioanode and biocathode were functionalized exclusively with essential components including lactate oxidase with tetrathiafulvalene and bilirubin oxidase with ABTS, respectively. The device exhibited an open-circuit potential (OCP) of about 600 mV and a maximum power density of 48.1 muW cm-2 at 20 mM lactate. Importantly, the power density increased linearly with lactate concentration across the physiologically relevant sweat range (5-20 mM, slope 2.9 muW cm-2 mM-1, R2 = 0.997), underscoring its suitability for sweat-based biosensing.

To help address this challenge, we have refined the human vascularized liver acinus microphysiological system (vLAMPS), which provides an all-human platform for drug development, in line with recently updated federal requirements for the use of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs). By introducing clinically relevant media perturbations and employing several diverse and reproducible in situ and systemic measurements, we show that the vLAMPS can recapitulate key structural and functional aspects of normal physiology, acinus zonation, and all stages of MASLD progression including stellate cell activation and fibrosis. Importantly, in this study we also demonstrate that several hallmarks of lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance paralleled MASLD progression. These included diminution of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) protein, compromised insulin receptor mediated insulin clearance, enhanced pericentral lipid accumulation, increased VLDL secretion, and enhanced hepatic glucose output mediated by increased periportal nuclear translocation of FOXO1.

In Stage 1, the model determines whether a publication describes any form of protein autoregulation. In Stage 2, positive instances are further classified into one of seven mechanistic categories: autophosphorylation, autoubiquitination, autocatalytic activity, autoinhibition, autolysis, autoinducer production, and autoregulation. SOORENA was fine-tuned from PubMedBERT using a curated dataset of 1,332 experimentally validated abstracts sourced from UniProt-referenced publications. On a held-out test set, Stage 1 achieved an accuracy of 96.0% and a precision of 97.8%, effectively minimizing false positive propagation. Stage 2 demonstrated robust performance across all classes, with an overall accuracy of 95.5% and a macro-F1 score of 96.2%, including perfect classification for the two least-represented categories. Error analysis revealed that most misclassifications occurred between mechanistically related categories, suggesting that the model's learned representations reflect underlying biological relationships.

Existing tools struggle with the scale and complexity of scATAC-seq datasets, limiting tasks like clustering, cell-type annotation, and reference mapping. A promising solution is using foundation models adapted to specific tasks via transfer learning. While transfer learning has been applied to scRNA-seq, its potential for scATAC-seq remains underexplored. **Methods**: We introduce Atacformer, a transformer-based foundation model for scATAC-seq data analysis. Unlike other models that only produce cell-level representations, Atacformer generates embeddings for individual cis-regulatory elements. Pre-trained on a large atlas of scATAC-seq experiments, Atacformer learns robust representations of genomic regulatory regions for downstream use. After pretraining, the model is fine-tuned for cell-type prediction and batch correction.

The sequence stream employs a learnable multi-kernel convolution layer that combines features from multiple kernel sizes through attention-based gating, enabling adaptive motif detection without relying on a fixed receptive field. A self-attention layer models long-range dependencies, while cross-attention integrates sequence, domain, and PPI representations into a unified prediction space.

Although Xoc deploys a variety of non-transcription activator-like (non-TAL) effectors to subvert host defenses, the mechanistic basis of how these effectors modulate plant immune signaling remains largely unclear. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the rice scaffold protein OsRACK1B as a host target of Xoc effector XopN, and its potential role during Xoc infection was characterized by combining gene function with biochemical analyses. We demonstrate that XopN suppresses rice immune responses and physically interacts with the rice scaffold protein OsRACK1B. Notably, OsRACK1B expression is induced following Xoc infection in a type III secretion system (T3SS)-independent manner. Functional analyses indicate that OsRACK1B overexpression enhances Xoc resistance, whereas loss-of-function mutants exhibit heightened susceptibility. This increased susceptibility is characterized by compromised immunity, including reduced callose deposition, diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and attenuated expression of defense-related genes such as OsPBZ1 and OsPAL1. Furthermore, XopN competes with OsRap2.6 for binding to OsRACK1B, thereby disrupting the formation of the OsRACK1B-OsRap2.6 immune complex.

Here, we combined mathematical modeling with spatiotemporal analyses of the murine hippocampus and cerebellum from postnatal day 2 (P2) to P60 to reconstruct the trajectory of microglial development. We identified a proliferative-to-quiescent (P/Q) switch around P3/P4 that preceded the acquisition of morphological complexity and efficient phagocytosis and was accompanied by coordinated shifts in cell-cycle dynamics and metabolic state. Strikingly, this P/Q switch was recapitulated in repopulation contexts in mice and in the human fetal brain, where later stages displayed enhanced phagocytic function coupled to reduced proliferation. Perturbing the proliferative phase through pharmacological or genetic disruption of CSF1R signaling impaired subsequent microglial complexity and phagocytosis efficiency, revealing an unexpected reliance of phagocytosis on proliferation-driven colonization. Finally, we show that microglia stepwise maturation during development is associated with chromatin remodeling and driven by the epigenetic regulator Ikaros.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization-immunohistochemistry (FISH-IHC) revealed robust D1Aa and D2a expression in forebrain auditory-recipient centers that receive catecholaminergic input: postcommissural and ventral nuclei of the ventral telencephalon, anterior tuberal nucleus, central posterior nucleus of the thalamus, and parvocellular preoptic nuclei. Large dopamine neurons in the periventricular posterior tuberculum, which are, in part, responsible for the reproductive-state changes in central and peripheral catecholamine innervation only express D2a, whereas large noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus express both D1Aa and D2a. The midbrain torus semicircularis, periaqueductal gray, hindbrain octavolateralis efferent nucleus, and descending/secondary octaval nuclei also express both receptor types. D2a expression predominates over D1Aa, and we identify a subpopulation of cells throughout the auditory system that co-express both receptors. The robust distribution of inhibitory and excitatory dopamine receptor expression in the central auditory system, coupled with co-expression in a subset of cells, provides strong neuroanatomical evidence of dopamines complex role in modulating auditory sensitivity and processing.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

However, like many other neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular pathogenesis of FTD and ALS is not fully understood. Our group has previously reported evidence for a pervasive elevation of brain urea levels in five other dementia-causing diseases. However, brain urea levels have yet to be measured in ALS and FTD. Here, we employed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to characterise brain urea differences between control (n=14/12) and ALS/FTD (FTD: n=8/9; ALS: n=13/14) cases in post-mortem tissue from two brain regions with different levels of neuropathological burden (high vs. low). Elevated urea levels were observed in both the frontal cortex (high neuropathological burden) and primary visual cortex (low neuropathological burden) in cases with FTD. Contrastingly, in cases with ALS, elevated urea was observed in the primary motor cortex (high neuropathological burden), but not the dentate nucleus (low neuropathological burden). These results not only suggest that elevated urea levels are also present in ALS and FTD but imply that elevated brain urea is linked to a multi-dementia pathogenic mechanism. In contrast to ALS, the observation of elevated urea in regions of both high and low neuropathological burden in FTD implies that this phenotype is likely widespread and, therefore, may play a larger role in the pathogenesis of disease. Such a mechanism could offer new directions for developing treatments targeting this underlying pathology.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

We also applied a novel computational model to identify novel complex spatial patterns, using coupled phase oscillators to reveal hidden spirals that were not clearly visible in the original recordings. The orientation of these hidden spirals distinguished between separate cognitive states, such as memory encoding and retrieval. Our simultaneous empirical and computational modeling provides a general framework to probe the functional significance and neurocomputational mechanisms underlying a diverse range of spatial patterns of traveling waves.

This effect is commonly attributed to stress-related changes in affective evaluation of rewards and their associated uncertainty. However, existing research has yielded inconsistent findings, and the psychological and neural mechanisms at play remain poorly understood. Here we show that acute psychosocial stress can affect financial risk-taking by altering basic perception of payoff magnitudes, independent of subjective valuation processes. Psychophysical and fMRI modelling reveals that stress reduces risk-aversion without changing choice consistency. A Bayesian perceptual model attributes this effect to an upward shift in prior beliefs about payoff magnitude: Under stress, participants choices are guided by relatively more optimistic beliefs about the risky options. A convergent pattern emerges in parietal neural representations of the payoff magnitudes, which show a systematic upward shift in neural coding as a consequence of the stress manipulation. These findings provide converging neural and behavioral evidence that stress influences financial risk-taking by changing neurocomputational processes related to magnitude perception. This has significant implications for psychological and neuroscience theories of stress and risky behavior, with potential applications to policy and clinical interventions.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Though mammalian TNF biology is well studied, the pleotropic nature of this cytokine during inflammation or infection in other vertebrates remains elusive. Interestingly, zebrafish possess two homologues of mammalian TNF, Tnfa and Tnfb. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the role of tnfa during infection or inflammation, while tnfb may also have important roles, yet has remained largely unexplored. Here, we generated and characterized two transgenic reporter lines, Tg(-3.2tnfb:eGFP-F)ump21Tg and Tg(-6.2tnfb:mCherry-F)ump22Tg, marking tnfb expression in zebrafish. By combining our tnfb reporters with other available reporter lines, with high-resolution in vivo microscopy, and with public scRNAseq datasets, we define, in a cell type-specific manner, the expression kinetics of tnfb compared to those of tnfa and il1b. We report on constitutive tnfb expression in neuromast mantle cells from 32 hours post-fertilization onwards, and inducible tnfb expression in subpopulations of macrophages and neutrophils after caudal fin fold amputation and E. coli injection. After amputation, tnfb kinetics of expression are cell-dependent, with expression in macrophages detected prior to that in neutrophils. When analysing the kinetics of expression of tnfb, tnfa and il1b after wounding, our data indicate that, at least in macrophages, a sequential expression occurs, with tnfb being expressed first, followed by tnfa and il1b. Combined, these data show that tnfb has distinct characteristics from tnfa, indicative of a differential role of these cytokines. Our new tnfb reporter lines, set the stage for future studies in which both TNF homologs can be investigated placing zebrafish as an especially suited model to dissect the pleiotropic nature of Tnf in non-mammalian vertebrates.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Early phases of healing rely on the timely clearance of debris, a task primarily carried out by macrophages and osteoclasts. However, the sequence of events leading to the presence of osteoclasts at the fracture site and how this is shaped by local tissue microenvironments remains poorly understood, particularly at single-cell and spatial resolution. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and multi-epitope ligand cartography, we mapped the spatial organization of distinct cell compartments engaged in early fracture healing in both young and aged mice at the start of healing. Surprisingly, we found that young mice exhibited an increased presence of activated osteoclasts at day 7, concentrated within the cortical niche. This compartment was also characterized by a spatially restricted immune response with a selective accumulation of distinct macrophage types jointly interacting with neutrophils and stromal cells. This raised the possibility that local cell organization influences osteoclast precursor differentiation. We identified a distinct Spp1hi macrophage subset restricted to the cortex, which acted as a transitional precursor population giving rise to osteoclasts. Neutrophils preceded this Spp1hi macrophage accumulation and may promote their recruitment through chemotactic signaling. This coordination was less pronounced in aged mice despite preserved transcriptional states. In parallel, stromal cells in young animals displayed higher expression of essential niche factors further supporting local osteoclastogenesis at the cortex. Together, our findings identify distinct macrophage precursors and reveal early, cortex-specific niche activity supporting osteoclastogenesis. This provides a new framework for understanding the initiation of spatial immune-stromal interactions for the early stages of regeneration.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we systematically assessed the stability of ADPr linkages using synthetic peptides and confirmed that ester-linked Glu/Asp-ADPr is lost under alkaline conditions, elevated temperatures, or through hydrolysis by wildtype Af1521. We established an acidic enrichment workflow encompassing an Af1521 mutant, robustly preserving Glu/Asp-ADPr enabling their site-specific and systems-wide MS analysis.

Our analysis uncovered that Glu/Asp-ADPr marks distinct cytoplasmic protein networks enriched in immune functions, contrasting with Ser-ADPr typically observed on nuclear and chromatin-associated proteins. Quantitative profiling revealed reproducible ADPr patterns specific to cell type and treatment. Notably, PARP10 promoted Glu/Asp modification of ubiquitin, highlighting crosstalk between ADPr and ubiquitin signaling. Across interferon treatments, we identified a conserved network of antiviral PARPs and associated cofactors extensively modified on Glu/Asp residues, emphasizing residue-specific ADPr as a regulator of innate immune signaling.

All affected individuals had EL, and 26.09% also showed ectopia pupillae (EP). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated adamtsl4-knockout zebrafish recapitulated human ocular features with comparable incidence.

Genetic clustering analysis placed these individuals within the genetic variation of ancient and modern Central Eurasian and Siberian populations.

However, the soil processes that determine these co-benefits remain poorly constrained. In particular, interactions between basalt amendments and soil biota such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may influence nutrient mobilization and plant uptake, but these effects have rarely been quantified. In a 113-day mesocosm experiment with Zea mays using a Belgian, sandy loam soil, we investigated the effect of basalt and AMF inoculation on soil properties, nutrient and heavy metal availability, and crop yield and quality. We also assessed potential AMF-driven bio-weathering via cation mass balance and pore water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH, and alkalinity measurements. Basalt application, but not AMF, improved soil pH, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, and generally increased exchangeable Ca and Mg, whereas most other nutrients in the pore water remained unaffected. Crop yield and quality were largely unaltered by basalt or AMF, except for an increase in plant Mg with basalt application. Moreover, heavy metal availability and plant uptake were also generally unaffected, with the notable exception of soil pore water and corn Ni, which increased with basalt. These results suggest that risk for heavy metal contamination is not generic but may arise under specific environmental conditions. Finally, despite a synergistic effect of basalt and AMF on pore water DIC, we found no indication that AMF enhanced basalt weathering rates. Overall, AMF had limited influence on soil fertility indicators and crop performance. Basalt application improved key soil chemical indicators and increased the exchangeable fractions of Ca and Mg, demonstrating its role as a soil improver. Unlike several studies conducted in more acidic soils, these chemical enhancements did not increase maize growth here, indicating that the agronomic benefits of basalt are context-dependent.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

However, as sensor dimensions decrease, the low light emission issue in ECL becomes severe. We introduce a novel fully integrated miniaturized silicon device consisting of three sensors comprised of unique entwined micro-spiral electrodes in a generator-collector configuration. This enables highly sensitive, coreactant-free multiplexed sensing at physiological pH by accelerating in-situ reactive oxygen species production and boosting ECL intensity. Systematic optimization of electrode geometry (gaps and widths) yields an 11-fold improvement in ECL signal compared to a single-electrode setup, as well as excellent reproducibility and stability. In addition to Trolox and H2O2 detection, the platform demonstrates multiplex immunosensing through selective functionalization of the collector electrodes with chitosan nanocomposites, followed by Protein A/G-assisted immobilization of anti-IgG antibodies with peptide-based antifouling.

While the effect of locally accumulated charge in the variable region has been recognized as an important factor in mediating non-specific mAb self-assembly, the effect of charge asymmetry, i.e. the distribution of oppositely charges residues, has been much less studied experimentally. Moreover, most studies restrict such analyses to the variable region of mAbs, leaving out possible contributions from the constant region of the molecule to the observed sticky behavior. Hence, the aim of this work is to correlate the charge asymmetry over the entire mAb surface to the extent of attractive self-interaction. To do so, we selected three mAbs with distinct solvent exposed surface distribution of charged residues, for which we computationally assessed the charge asymmetry and defined an apparent molecular stickiness ranking. We then tested this ranking experimentally by evaluating their ability to engage in attractive self-interaction as a function of mAb concentration and ionic strength. Experimental data included a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, dynamic light scattering and micro-flow imaging. We show that the mAbs with oppositely charged Fab and Fc domains are characterized by overall attractive protein-protein interactions in solution amounting to diverse sub-visible morphologies, which vary non-linearly with mAb concentration and ionic strength. As a proof of concept, we also report the absence of any of such assemblies for the mAb with like-charged Fab and Fc domains, resulting in an overall repulsive behavior in solution. Altogether, we show how to utilize charge distribution analyses of full-length mAbs to rationally develop formulations that pre-vent problematic self-assembly.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Our previous research demonstrated that keratin fusion variants increase tumor aggressiveness through enhanced cancer stemness in oral squamous cell carcinoma. The proper functioning of keratins plays an essential role in maintaining cell structure while determining cell fate. The present study demonstrates that keratin fusion variant drives genomic instability through cytokinesis defects, which results in the formation of polyaneuploid cancer cells (PACC). The cells expressing keratin fusion show elevated DNA damage repair gene expression, which serves as a key factor for mitotic slippage during cancer development. The PACCs generated by keratin fusion make cancer cells resistant to cisplatin treatment while simultaneously reducing {gamma}-H2AX induction and increasing survival rates. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis results showed increased \"regulation of actin cytoskeleton\" activity in keratin fusion-expressing cells correlated with elevated actin filament networks and increased cell motility in these cells. In summary, the keratin fusion variant enhances cancer aggressiveness through three mechanisms: it creates genomic instability that leads to PACC formation and enables cancer cells to evade cGAS/STING-mediated death signals and modifies cytoskeleton structures, which results in drug resistance and metastasis.

We exposed saplings of three temperate and tropical species to rising Tair (20 to 40{degrees}C) at low (1.2 to 1.9 kPa) and increasing VPD (1.1 to 5.6 kPa), and at stable Tair (35{degrees}C) to increasing VPD (1.4 to 4.3 kPa) under well-watered or chronic soil drought conditions (10%).

While a decoupling of Anet and gs only occurred when VPD was low, Anet and E decoupled under both VPD regimes at high Tair.

A.; Islam, S.; Catalfano, K.; Wilkins, H. M.; Blagg, B. S. J.; Zou, K.; Wolfe, M. S.", "abstract": "Deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), produced by gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) co-chaperone, activator of Hsp90 ATPase homolog 1 (AHA1), is known to promote the accumulation of toxic tau species; however, its effects on Abeta production remain unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of endogenous AHA1 decreases Abeta generation and reduces APP and gamma-secretase components, whereas AHA1 overexpression elevates Abeta production and the expression of these proteins. The AHA1-E67K mutant, which has impaired Hsp90 binding, lowers Abeta production and the levels of APP and gamma-secretase components compared with wild-type AHA1. AHA1 associates with APP and immature gamma-secretase components, including anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1 (APH1), indicating its role in APP proteolysis and Abeta production. Disruption of the AHA1/Hsp90 complex - through AHA1 knockdown, the E67K mutant, or a small-molecule inhibitor - reduces gamma-secretase assembly. Familial AD mutations in APP-C99 and presenilin-1 (PS1) increase AHA1, Hsp90, APP, and APH1 expression, enhancing Abeta production. Importantly, AHA1 knockdown decreases abnormal Abeta generation and C99, PS1-CTF, and APH1 levels in mutant APP cells, while AHA1 overexpression enhances Abeta production in PS1 mutant cells. Collectively, these findings reveal that AHA1 regulates Abeta production by modulating APP expression and gamma-secretase assembly, establishing AHA1 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in AD.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that incorporating orientation selectivity alongside retinotopy to guide stimulation dramatically improves fidelity of the evoked activity to the underlying neural code. We propose a Bottlenecked Rotation-Equivariant CNN (BRCNN) and demonstrate that neural responses can be predicted to a large degree using only retinotopy and orientation preference. Using this model, we design a retinotopy-and-orientation aware stimulation protocol and validate it in a state-of-the-art large-scale optogenetic stimulation simulation framework of primary visual cortex.

While intrarenal CD8+ T cell infiltration has been linked to disease activity in patients, their pathogenic contribution remains unclear, partly due to the lack of mechanistic insight from murine models. Methods: We investigated renal CD8+ T cell infiltration in female B6.NZMSle1/Sle2/Sle3 lupus-prone mice across different ages, comparing them to C57BL/6 controls. Histopathology was assessed using human-derived NIH Activity and Chronicity Indices, complemented by fibrosis quantification, immunohistochemistry, and digital image analysis. Kidney T cell subsets were evaluated by flow cytometry, and transcriptomic profiling was performed using microarrays. Results: Lupus-prone mice developed progressive kidney injury resembling human LN, with increasing NIH activity scores, collagen deposition, however with interindividual heterogeneity. CD8+ T cell infiltrates were significantly elevated in lupus kidneys as early as 3 months, rising with age and correlating with histological activity. CD8+ T cells localized to periglomerular and peritubular regions but did not predominate over CD4+ T cells, as confirmed by flow cytometry. Transcriptomic analyses revealed age-dependent upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, B cell-associated transcripts, and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways, while T cell-related signatures were more variable. Conclusions: B6.NZMSle1/Sle2/Sle3 mice recapitulate several histopathological and molecular features of human LN, including progressive fibrosis and intrarenal CD8+ T cell infiltration that correlate with disease severity. However, the absence of CD8+ predominance suggests limitations of this model for dissecting CD8+ T cell-specific contributions to LN pathogenesis. Yet, these findings underscore the need to identify renal antigens driving CD8+ T cell responses in human LN.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

C.; Wang, B.", "abstract": "One group of human proteins found in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus is characterized by the presence of short (6-9aa), specific amino acid sequences thought to be involved in retaining proteins in the cytoplasm (cytoplasmic retention sequences). While strong evidence supports the ability of some peptides to act in this way, the number of such supported cases is small. We have taken the view that the situation would be improved by enhancing the methods available to identify cytoplasmic retention (CR) peptides. Here we describe an appropriate bioinformatic method to identify CR peptides using information about their location at the ends of cytoplasmic proteins. The method was then used to link seven different human cytoplasmic proteins with peptides suggested to have cytoplasmic retention activity. Further analysis was carried out with isoforms of the cytoplasmic proteins identified. Amino acid sequence information showed that while the proposed CR amino acid sequences can be the same or distinct in different protein isoforms, they are always located at the same site in the protein. For instance, while the proposed retention sequence of CCDC57 isoform X18 is MLARLVSNS, in isoform 7 it is SEPALNEL yet the two sequences are each located between amino acids 5 and 13 in the CCDC57 sequence. The results support the view that protein isoform is involved in determining the location of the CR sequence in a protein while the peptide sequence itself affects other variables such as the sub-region of the cytoplasm the protein needs to occupy. Overall, the study yielded identification of 15 candidate CR peptides in which 10 of the 15 have un-related amino acid sequences.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Disruption of this process leads to holoprosencephaly (HPE), a severe congenital brain malformation. Although mutations in several genes have been linked to HPE and studies using the chick embryo have implicated certain signaling pathways, yet the mechanisms by which mechanical signals are translated into tissue morphological changes remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we employed atomic force microscopy to map spatiotemporal stiffness gradients across the dorsal forebrain in the chick embryo during roof plate invagination. Our analysis revealed that the initial uniformly elevated levels of stiffness across the roof plate are dramatically altered during morphogenesis. A pronounced stiffness gradient emerges, whereby the roof plate midline becomes markedly more compliant than dorsolateral regions. Through expression screening, we identified Cdh-2 as a candidate mechanical regulator whose spatiotemporal expression pattern precisely mirrors the observed stiffness gradient. Both loss- and gain-of-function perturbations of Cdh-2 disrupted the normal stiffness gradient and caused significant architectural alterations, such as evagination or a V-shaped invagination of the roof plate. Mechanistically, Cdh-2 modulates tissue stiffness by regulating adherens junction stability and cortical F-actin distribution along the apicobasal axis of neuroepithelial cells. These findings highlight the importance of Cdh-2 and provide critical insights into the mechanical forces and molecular interactions governing forebrain roof plate morphogenesis while shedding light on the pathogenesis of HPE.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

However, applying these methods remains challenging, due in part to the complexity of DL workflows and the dynamic nature of available tools. 2. To address this, we created a practical guide and review, focused on one of the fundamental tasks in automated image analysis: image classification. Our approach integrates commonly used software and highlights key steps - from image acquisition to annotated, model-ready datasets, to training, evaluation and deployment. It is modular and supported by a flexible code base (Python & R) and Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), enabling adaptation to different models and ecological objectives. The goal is to empower ecologists to confidently incorporate computer vision into their research. 3. We illustrate this approach, using an open-source ROV dataset from the Norwegian Sea, featuring deep-sea biotopes defined by multivariate clusters of depth, substrate type, and associated species. To balance accessibility for users alongside performance, we focused on CNN models from the Ultralytics ML Platform (YOLO V.8 and V.11), comparing the full suite of architectures that range in complexity and efficiency. 4. Cross-validation revealed high overall performances and that larger, more complex models are not always superior, with YOLO V.8m best (Accuracy = ~0.98). Notably, high performances were achieved despite labels being based on both visual and external environmental predictors, suggesting visual features alone were sufficient for classification in this dataset. We highlight that the decision to deploy a model must be made in light of the study objectives, with domain-based reasoning and experience guiding every stage of implementation. 5.

Repeatability is limited by stochasticity, here defined as changes that are independent of genotypic fitness effects. Over short timescales, the two main sources of stochasticity of evolutionary change are environmental stochasticity and demographic (life-history) stochasticity. Quantifying the relative importance of these two sources of stochasticity in driving fitness outcomes is crucially important for predicting evolutionary responses. To gain insights in the effects of stochasticity, five institutes replicated an evolutionary experiment exposing Caenorhabditis elegans to novel rearing conditions. Replication across the institutes led to variation in selective environments, e.g. through divergent microbiomes among institutes. Replication within institutes was done across demographic treatments that influence the potential for population-size dependent fluctuations in allele frequencies (drift) and genetic hitchhiking (draft). We found high among-institute variation in fitness outcomes, which was partially explained by variation in microbiota. Whereas lab-specific effects explained most of the variance in mean fitness, the repeatability of fitness outcomes depended more on demographic heterogeneity. Specifically, population bottlenecks resulted in high among-replicate variation in fitness. When combined, environmental and demographic stochasticity additively reduced repeatability, underlining their additive importance in developing evolutionary forecasting tools. These results further highlight the importance of statistically integrating heterogeneity in experimental evolution to identify factors constraining outcome repeatability and study replicability.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

However, POP repair surgeries utilizing PPM have complications (most often pain or mesh exposure into the vagina) in over 10% of cases. Previous work has demonstrated that tensioning of meshes with certain geometries (diamond and hexagon pores), results in both planar (pore collapse) and nonplanar (wrinkles) deformations, significantly altering textile properties and impacting the host response. To further investigate the impact of mesh deformation on the host response, we implanted mesh in a validated non-human primate model via sacrocolpopexy with stable flat (square pores, N=20) versus deformed geometries (mesh loaded on the diamond prior to implantation resulting in collapsed pores and wrinkles, N=20). To investigate the impact of tension independent of deformation, we implanted on and off tension (10N, N=10 in each group). We hypothesized that more stable geometries trigger a healing response that achieves homeostasis while deformed mesh, by increasing the amount of material in contact with the host, triggers a maladaptive remodeling response with the formation of myofibroblasts. After twelve weeks, we found that mesh deformations and the absence of tension increase the amount of mesh per area on the vagina (mesh burden) and reproduced clinical complications (mesh exposure and vaginal thinning). Interestingly, MMT cells, or myofibroblasts co-expressing a macrophage marker (CD68), were seen to significantly increase in response to mesh burden, as well as respond hyper-locally to the mesh fiber interface. We observed decreased collagen density and more immature matrix deposited in conditions with higher MMT cell presence, showing more disorganization in deposited matrix with increased mesh burden, and the loss of tension. TGF-B;, in both active and latent forms, increased with increasing mesh burden, and highest expression was observed in conditions precipitating the highest percentage of MMT cells, a possible mechanism of transdifferentiation. This study showed the importance of PPM mesh properties on mesh burden following tensioning, impact on MMT transdifferentiation, and the downstream effect of these changes on the host response and healing outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Traditional methods often involve trade-offs between high-resolution neuronal imaging, behavioral recording, and the ability to apply chemical stimulation. Our innovative design overcomes these limitations by immobilizing the worm's head, stabilizing neuronal imaging, while allowing the posterior portion of the body to move freely, enabling the study of naturalistic behaviors during chemical stimulation. We applied this device to investigate how C. elegans responds to both attractive and aversive chemical cues. By correlating neural activity with observed behavior, we identified neurons and whole-brain dynamics associated with specific movements. Our results demonstrate that providing the worm with greater freedom of movement results in more naturalistic neuronal and behavioral responses to stimuli, compared to fully immobilized setups.

ProteoCast provides a three-tier variant classification (impactful, mild, neutral) to help prioritise mutations for clinical interpretation and experimental validation. It incorporates multiple sequence alignment quality controls to ensure prediction reliability and flag positions with insufficient evolutionary information. Beyond single-variant classification, ProteoCast employs a novel segmentation approach based on mutational sensitivity to identify functional linear peptides in disordered regions. Interactive visualisations guide users through results interpretation, from variant-level predictions to protein-wide functional landscapes. Evaluation on ~63,000 ClinVar variants demonstrates 77% sensitivity and 87% specificity for pathogenicity prediction, with performance maintained across species (85% accuracy on Drosophila lethal mutations). ProteoCast successfully identifies twice as many functional motifs in intrinsically disordered regions compared to conservation-based phylogenetic methods. Predictions can be tuned to specific conformations, such as bound forms in protein complexes, for improved accuracy and interpretability.

IFN systems are present with conserved antiviral functions across vertebrate lineages, including zebrafish (Danio rerio). In mammals, antiviral IFNs are divided between type I interferons (IFN-I), which drive systemic responses, and type III interferons (IFN-III), which protect barrier mucosal epithelia, owing to the specific distribution of their respective receptors. Although zebrafish lack IFN-III, they have IFN-Is which subdivide into 2 groups with distinct receptors, providing a unique opportunity to study how antiviral immunity has evolved in the absence of IFN-III. Whilst previous work has suggested complementary, non-redundant roles for IFNs from these groups, the tissue specificity has not yet been resolved. As larvae, zebrafish only express one group 1 (IFN{varphi}1) and one group 2 IFN (IFN{varphi}3). Using viral infection assays and reporter transgenics, we found that IFNs from group 1 (IFN{varphi}1) and group 2 (IFN{varphi}3) are produced by distinct subsets of cells, with no detectable co-expression. To assess tissue and cell-type-specific responses to these two IFNs, we used ISG reporter fish imaging and whole-larva single cell RNA sequencing after injection of recombinant IFN{varphi}1 and IFN{varphi}3. Despite a similar core ISG response, distinct downstream ISG programs across multiple tissues and organ systems were found. In particular, barrier epithelial cells, such as enterocytes, responded more strongly to IFN{varphi}1, while myeloid cells responded more strongly to IFN{varphi}3. Our results indicate that zebrafish IFN-I families have functionally diversified their antiviral immune responses by tissue context, driven by cellular partitioning of both IFN-I production and response. These results mirror the division of labour between mammalian IFN-I and IFN-III, emphasising the evolutionary importance of tissue division of immune responses, as well as deepening our understanding of the zebrafish as a model for host-pathogen interactions.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Despite improvements in recanalization treatments, stroke remains the second leading cause of death globally. Post-stroke infections (PSIs) are the main life-threatening complication (30-45% of all patients and 20% of mortality) after stroke. Traditionally attributed to nosocomial infections / associated medical procedures, ground-breaking research has revealed that PSIs primarily originate from bacterial translocation (BT) following gut barrier disruption after stroke. Despite the high mortality associated with PSIs, current treatments, including antibiotic prophylaxis, are largely ineffective, underscoring the urgent need for a better understanding of their aetiology. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), microbiota-derived metabolites produced by bacterial fermentation of fibres, are key regulators of the BIG axis. SCFAs exert neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects across models of neurodegenerative and infectious diseases. Using a preclinical stroke model (transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, MCAO) in 12-week-old male mice, we evaluated the effects of SCFA administration starting 24 h after stroke until sacrifice at day 4 on BT, gut integrity, and brain injury. Our findings confirmed that stroke induces BT to several organs (e.g., liver, heart, spleen) and, for the first time, demonstrated bacterial presence in the brainstem and the ischemic core of the injured brain. Importantly, we also showed that SCFA treatment significantly reduced BT to several organs. In addition, SCFAs modulated gut barrier integrity, reduced brain lesion size, and improved functional recovery. These findings highlight the crucial role of SCFAs in the BIG axis following stroke and their potential to mitigate not only gut barrier disruption and brain injury, but also infection-related complications, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for one of the least understood yet most lethal complications of stroke.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Enhanced and suppressed neural responses to semantically matched cross-modal stimuli were found in distinct EVC populations, with suppression population carrying denser, behaviorally relevant semantic information. Both populations support semantic integration with distinct temporal dynamics and representational structures. These findings provide representational- and computational-level insights into how the brain integrates information across modalities, revealing unified principles of information processing that link biological and artificial intelligence.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

A comprehensive Trypanosoma PEX19 interactome analysis uncovered PEX38 as a novel and essential Euglenozoa-specific peroxin. PEX38 contains distinct domains that bind the co-chaperone Hip and the PEX3-binding motif of PEX19, suggesting a role in stabilizing membrane protein and preventing premature membrane docking. PEX38 illustrates functional repurposing in organelle biogenesis. It originated from a remnant of the GET/TRC pathway, typically responsible for the targeting of tail-anchored proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. While most components of this machinery are absent in Euglenozoa, PEX38 has been retained and adapted to mediate peroxisomal membrane protein targeting. This evolutionary adaptation is unique to Euglenozoa. Because the PEX19-PEX38 interaction is essential for parasite viability and PEX38 has no human homologs, this complex is a promising therapeutic target against trypanosomatid parasites.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

C.; Demuynck, J. M.; Muniz, C.; Slabbekoorn, H.", "abstract": "The marine world is an acoustic world that has become noisier with the increasing diversity and intensity of human activities at sea. The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is one of the best-studied cetaceans regarding hearing and responses to human-made underwater sound. The species is most sensitive to high frequencies, yet most impact studies have focused on relatively low-frequency sources. As such, the effects of high frequency sonar - including echosounders - remain largely unstudied, despite their widespread use on vessels for depth sounding, fish or object detection, and seabed mapping. We investigated the effects of scientific echosounder use on harbour porpoise occurrence using 13 multi-sensor mooring deployments in the southern part of the North Sea. Moorings operated for an average of 57 days, with split-beam scientific echosounders active for an average of 51 days, for 10 minutes every hour (5 min at 70 kHz, followed by 5 min at either 185-255 kHz or 70 kHz again). Porpoise acoustic presence was continuously monitored with C/F-PODs and additionally validated with hydrophone detections at four of the locations. Across all 13 sites, detections declined by 65-79% during echosounder transmissions and returned to typical levels within ~30 minutes after the echosounder stopped pinging. Despite this relatively quick recovery, there was no indication of habituation, as responses did not diminish across observation periods over six weeks of hourly exposure. Spatial effects appeared local, as no deterrent effect was observed at 2.5 km from the source. We believe that our findings have important implications for studies that investigate both harbour porpoise and fish presence to understand predator-prey interactions, but they should also raise concern about the potentially cumulative impact on sensitive cetaceans from the wide use of relatively high frequency sonar in offshore practices.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

We generated chromosomal-level genomes of Pila celebensis and Pila pesmei, revealing a genus-specific doubling in genome size driven by transposable element expansions. Parallel chromosomal rearrangements linked to environmental sensing, stress responses, and metabolism were identified in both lineages. Gene family analyses uncovered parallel expansions in cellulases, immune genes, and environmental sensors, alongside convergent positive selection in aquaporins critical for aerial osmoregulation. Strikingly, proteomics of egg perivitelline fluid (PVF) highlighted parallel adaptations in the PV1 protein family, where increased hydrophobicity enhances desiccation resistance in aerially deposited eggs. Phylogenetic and structural evidence traced PV1's likely origin to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from a virus in the Ampullariidae ancestor, with subsequent duplications enabling lineage-specific aerial adaptations.

Individuals encouraged to forage more frequently with non-relatives subsequently developed stronger foraging associations with non-kin at separate, unrestricted feeders.

Quantification of physical forces in MPS has received little attention. The goal of this study was to establish a simple and robust system capable of interfacing with existing pumps to quantitatively characterize the flow delivered to a MPS. The system assessed both the fluid pressure driving flow through a microphysiological platform and the resistance to flow of glass capillary tubes or a model vascular network. The system showed excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with resistance values measured by a hydrostatic approach and predicted for laminar flow through a smooth capillary tube. Importantly, the system is optically-based without sensors contacting the circulating fluid making it ideally-suited for long-term biological studies where sterility is paramount.

Interestingly, AXL was undetectable in steady-state MCs, whereas various factors including IFN- and IFN-{beta} induced its expression, consistent with the inflammatory nature of mastocytosis and elevated interferon levels detected in patient plasma. Ectopic expression of WT or L197M AXL in the ROSA KIT D816V cell line enhanced proliferation and survival by upregulating pSTAT5, pSTAT3, pFAK, p-p38, survivin and BCL2. Both AXL forms conferred resistance to the KIT inhibitor PKC412/midostaurin by sustaining BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL expression while reducing caspase-3 activation. Although L197M AXL induced slightly higher resistance to apoptosis than WT, no major differences observed. Combined KIT and AXL targeting (PKC412+R428) restored TKI sensitivity by downregulating BCL-XL, Livin, cIAP1, and activating caspase-3, highlighting the therapeutic potential of dual KIT/AXL pathway inhibition.

Previous histological studies on cockroaches described that uric acid is accumulated within the fat body, especially in urocytes. Here we report that cockroaches also accumulate uric acid in the wings. In our observation of the German cockroach Blattella germanica under different nutritional conditions, we found that well-fed cockroaches exhibited whitish aggregates in the wing veins, which is ascribed to accumulation of uric acid granules.

This plasticity is driven by hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs), which generate new neurons and maintain circuit integrity, but are highly sensitive to environmental and pathological influences. Mechanistic insight into human hippocampal development and neurogenesis remains limited by the absence of physiologically relevant models. Here, we establish an optimized protocol to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hippocampal organoids that recapitulate key features of hippocampal development. These organoids maintain organized NSC niches, support ongoing neurogenesis, and generate hippocampus-specific cell types. Cellular, transcriptomic, and electrophysiological analyses confirm progressive neuronal maturation, synapse formation, and functional activity, highlighting the physiological relevance of the system. Using this model, we modeled excess prenatal glucocorticoid exposure with dexamethasone, which perturbed NSC dynamics by reducing proliferation and inducing a precocious quiescent-like state. RNA sequencing revealed downregulation of NSC activation genes and upregulation of quiescence- and autophagy-associated programs, suggesting that glucocorticoid signaling enforces an early transition toward quiescence. These findings reveal a mechanism by which excessive glucocorticoid exposure may impair hippocampal growth. Together, this study introduces a robust human hippocampal organoid platform for dissecting the regulation of hippocampal development and for modeling the impact of environmental stressors on human neurogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Objectives: Sleep benefits memory, but whether this benefit depends on initial memory strength remains heavily debated. We asked whether overnight sleep preferentially stabilizes weakly vs. strongly encoded declarative items, and whether classical sleep oscillations account for any benefit. Methods: Ninety healthy adults (n=30/group) learned 80 unrelated word pairs; half were presented twice (S-, weak), while the other half was studied three times (S+, strong). Memory retention was tested after (i) 9hrs containing nocturnal sleep (n= 30), (ii) a comparable daytime waking period (n= 30), or (iii) immediately (~40-min) after encoding. Accuracy (cued recall) and reaction times (RT) indexed memory accessibility. In the sleep group, polysomnography was used to quantify slow oscillation (SO) density as well as fast spindle intensity to study potential relations to memory performance. Results: Strongly encoded items (S+) were recalled better than weak items (S-) in all three groups. An interaction indicated that WAKE disproportionately forgot more weak items S- relative to strong S+ items, whereas SLEEP showed no differential benefit for weak versus strong items, with performance more closely resembling that of the immediate recall group. Reaction-time analyses echoed this pattern with WAKE responding more slowly than SLEEP and IMMEDIATE, and there is no RT difference between SLEEP and IMMEDIATE. S+ were retrieved faster than S- (with no group interaction). Finally, classical sleep markers did not account for overnight retention: spindle and slow-oscillation metrics showed no stronger associations on the learning night than on the adaptation night and did not differ by item strength, suggesting largely trait-like rather than state-dependent relationships between these oscillations and declarative memory. Conclusions: Sleep protects declarative memories irrespective of initial strength and matches immediate recall performance. Traditional sleep metrics, such as slow oscillation density and spindle intensity, did not predict overnight retention performance but instead reflected more trait-like relationships.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

This study refines our understanding of Aotus systematics by employing fecal metagenomics to generate complete mitochondrial genomes from strategically collected samples across the lower Amazon Basin. Phylogenetic analyses integrating Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian inference, and species delimitation frameworks revealed several corrections to previously proposed biogeographic ranges and clarified evolutionary relationships among taxa.

Cancer therapy often induces gene regulatory responses that promote cell survival in the face of this therapy. Herein, we sought to develop a stochastic model of the response to repeat therapeutic challenge. This model integrates reinforcement learning to account for environmental history-dependent cellular transitions and growth dynamics. When applied to prostate cancer, this memory-driven adaptive model successfully captures the experimentally-observed dynamics of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant LNCaP cells under varying dosing schedules of androgen receptor blockade with enzalutamide (enza), significantly outperforming traditional transition models that lack history dependence. This performance is especially evident in the ability of our approach to robustly predict stochastic fluctuations in cancer cell population sizes across the entire disease trajectory, including subtle, later-emerging responses following initial therapy. The model was further evaluated by predicting the control of resistant cells in an enza environment by modeling inhibition of the p38/MAPK pro-survival stress axis, which was then validated experimentally. Lastly, we developed and applied a patient-calibrated model using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) data from clinical patient cohorts undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy. Our model accurately predicts the PSA dynamics under repeated treatment cycles and effectively distinguishing between patients who respond and those who do not respond to treatment, thereby providing quantitative insight into prostate cancer progression.

While genetic control strategies such as the release of sterile males or individuals carrying dominant lethal alleles have achieved some success, they typically require repeated, large-scale releases due to immediate selection against costly alleles, limiting scalability and applicability to species that are difficult to rear in the laboratory. Recent CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing has enabled the development of more efficient genetic control methods that bias their own inheritance and impose a genetic load to achieve population suppression. These designs can potentially spread throughout an entire species range, making them unsuitable when only local or temporary suppression is needed. Here we explore self-limiting genetic strategies based on releasing males carrying autosomal genomic editors that create deleterious edits in essential genes. Unlike traditional approaches, where costly alleles are immediately purged, these editors can persist through multiple generations when creating female-specific or recessive edits, or when editing rates are less than 100%. This allows editors to survive in males, heterozygous carriers, or individuals unaffected by incomplete editing, trading immediate lethality for accumulated genetic load over time. Using deterministic population modelling, we demonstrate that homozygous releases of editors creating female-specific dominant or recessive edits require 45% and 50% fewer males than releasing individuals carrying dominant lethal alleles (RIDL), respectively, to achieve comparable suppression levels. Efficiency gains are further enhanced by targeting multiple genes simultaneously, with editors making female-specific recessive edits showing approximately 50% reduction in release requirements when targeting three genes compared to one - representing a 73% reduction compared to RIDL. Co-releasing editors with a second construct that temporarily boosts editor frequency can achieve efficiency comparable to previously proposed selectively neutral designs while maintaining temporal self-limitation. These results highlight promising alternative strategies for achieving localised, efficient, and self-limiting pest population control suitable for contexts requiring contained suppression.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Many methods explicitly incorporate structural biases or constraints - for example, enforcing symmetry during generation - to steer the design process. Here we report the spontaneous emergence of structural symmetry in a transformer-based generative model for proteins, without any symmetry-specific conditioning during training or constraints during generation. In our flow-matching model, a single attention head in an SE(3)-equivariant transformer layer was found to be primarily responsible for the model's ability to generate symmetric arrangements of backbone residues across chains, or repeating motifs within a chain. Our results show that protein generative models can learn high-level structural patterns implicitly from training data. This opens new questions about interpretability and control in generative design: understanding how and why a single attention head can govern a complex global property like symmetry may inform future model architectures and help exploit emergent behaviors for better protein engineering.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) exploit this vulnerability by stalling DNA repair particularly in homologous recombination (HR)-deficient cancer cells. Although PARPi are now used to treat BRCA1/2-mutated cancers such as ovarian and breast cancers, they are still limited to a narrow range of clinical indications and are susceptible to acquired resistance. Here, we introduce 'DNA Damage Chemical Inducers of Proximity' (DD-CIPs), bivalent molecules that rewire the mechanism of action of conventional PARPi. The DD-CIPs function through chemical induced proximity between PARP1/2 and the chromatin remodeling protein, BRD4. From a candidate library of DD-CIPs, we identified DD-CIP1 which induces the DNA damage response (DDR) and apoptosis to a range of cancer lines at two-digit nanomolar concentrations. Further optimization yielded DD-CIP2, which induces tumor cell death at nanomolar concentrations across diverse blood and solid cancer cells, including cancer types that are insensitive to PARPi. Using small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a model, we found that DD-CIP2 triggers DDR, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in vitro, leading to anti-tumor efficacy without substantial toxicity in preclinical SCLC xenograft models at well tolerated doses. Our findings demonstrate that DD-CIPs may provide an opportunity to address the limitations of traditional PARPi and establish chemical induced proximity as a strategy for modulating the DDR in cancer.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

The exemplar protocol utilises a small, cell-permeable fluorophosphonate probe to covalently label active serine hydrolases simultaneously within Leishmania mexicana parasites and their murine macrophage host cells during active infection. Subsequent biorthogonal click chemistry, affinity enrichment, and quantitative mass spectrometry using Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) enable the identification and relative quantification of functionally active enzymes across the interactome. This method facilitates the delineation of dynamic changes in enzyme activity during the infection process, yielding rich insight into host-pathogen biochemical networks, including the identification of pathogen virulence factors and host responses. Therefore, INTERACT delivers a robust and quantitative workflow to probe enzymatic activity across two species in a single experiment under native infection conditions, without the need for genetic manipulation, providing an invaluable platform for dissecting pathogenesis and uncovering novel therapeutic targets in infectious diseases.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

To address this, we developed CRISPR-rabies virus (CRV), which leverages the trans-synaptic spread of rabies virus to enable gene editing within anatomically defined neural circuits. By pairing CRV with cell type-specific Cas9 expression, we achieved targeted gene modifications in specific circuits. We demonstrate that CRV can modulate sodium and potassium channel expression in parvalbumin interneurons, thereby effectively regulating synaptic transmission of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Its compatibility with 3'-capture single-cell RNA-seq allows simultaneous circuit perturbation and molecular profiling. In summary, CRV allows precise circuit-level gene modulation, providing a platform for studying gene function in neural circuits and developing novel gene therapies for brain disorders.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

While event-related potential (ERPs) studies of face processing have produced mixed results, little work has examined neuro-oscillatory dynamics, which may better capture the integrity of underlying networks. To address this gap, EEG was recorded from children aged 8-13 across three groups: autistic (n = 50), non-autistic (n = 38) and siblings of autistic children (n = 26), during a visual oddball task. In a blocked design, participants viewed faces and objects, presented upright and inverted (non-targets), to assess the face inversion effect (the FIE; a larger or earlier N170 to inverted than upright faces), and responded to infrequent shadow versions (targets). Analyses using permutation statistics and linear mixed models focused on non-target stimuli, quantifying face-related ERPs (P1, N170) and oscillatory activity associated with sensory and attentional processing (theta, alpha, gamma). Across groups, faces elicited earlier P1 and larger N170 amplitudes than objects, and showed a FIE. Furthermore, the rightward lateralization of the FIE was reduced for autistic participants. Analyses in the frequency domain revealed greater induced theta for inverted versus upright stimuli and for faces versus objects, revealing face specific effects, and stronger theta for inverted faces for the autistic and sibling groups, suggesting greater cognitive effort in processing these social stimuli. Gamma-band inter-trial phase coherence exhibited face selectivity only in the non-autistic group, pointing to differences in early network synchronization in autistic children relative to their non-autistic peers, whereas alpha event-related desynchronization did not vary by group or category. Altogether, these findings support altered neural synchronization/efficiency for autistic participants and siblings of autistic children, that is specific to face stimuli and seen despite largely typical sensory driven encoding. These data suggest that neural oscillatory assays are more sensitive to face processing differences in autism than broadband ERPs and that these oscillatory assays may be endophenotypic.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

However, the neural processes that follow reactivation and contribute to long-term retention remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the post-retrieval resting period to identify neural markers of memory reactivation and their relation to subsequent memory performance. Participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables in multisensory contexts and, on the following day, received either a cue-syllable reminder (context + cue syllable; RX) or a context-only reminder (RCTX) while EEG activity was recorded before and after the reminder presentation. Both reminders elicited significant reductions in beta power (25-40)Hz during the post-reminder rest, consistent with memory reactivation. The magnitude of beta decrement correlated with better long-term performance. Graph-theoretical analyses of phase synchronization networks in the beta band revealed that the RCTX reminder produced higher bilateral frontal betweenness centrality, suggesting greater engagement of frontal regions in mediating global information flow when retrieving only contextual cues. Moreover, frontal centrality and network density were predictive of subsequent memory accuracy. These findings demonstrate that memory reactivation extends beyond cue presentation into post-retrieval rest, leaving identifiable oscillatory and topological signatures that influence memory persistence. Our results underscore the crucial role of frontal network dynamics and beta-band activity in facilitating long-term memory.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Although fear conditioning is one of the most widely used models to study anxiety in humans, much remains to be explored regarding its underlying neural correlates. It is known that the retrieval of consolidated memories can trigger modifications, weakening, strengthening, or updating of the original memory, depending on the cues presented during the reminder. In this study, we employed a three-day threat-conditioning protocol in which an angry face (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was paired with an aversive sound (unconditioned stimulus, US). Our main objective was to identify neural markers of post-retrieval processes triggered by the presentation of the CS+ alone, 24 hours after acquisition. Additionally, we aimed to assess cognitive biases by examining how the perception of the conditioned stimulus changes following conditioning. To this end, we recorded resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) activity using a 30-channel system at a 256 Hz sampling rate. We analyzed four minutes of resting-state EEG following the presentation of the reminder cue, focusing on memory-related patterns in the frequency domain and microstate dynamics. We compared neural activity after the reminder presentation between two groups: a Reactivation group previously exposed to threat conditioning on the first day and a Control group with no prior conditioning. Our results confirmed successful conditioning (CS+ US association) and memory retention 48 hours later, as evidenced by higher skin conductance responses and greater US expectancy to the CS+. Moreover, participants rated the CS+ face as more aversive than the CS-; face 48 hours after conditioning, compared to their pre-conditioning ratings. Relative to the Control group, the Reactivation group showed decreased beta-band activity (25-30 Hz) in central regions during the 90 seconds following the reminder, which may reflect enhanced post-reactivation processing of the memory, in contrast to participants who saw the face for the first time. Previous research has highlighted the role of reduced beta amplitude in the encoding and retrieval of another type of memory: episodic memory. Furthermore, when analyzing EEG microstates (short-lived, quasi-stable topographies of brain activity that reoccur over time), we found lower global field power for microstates C, A, E, and B in the Reactivation group compared with the Control group. Our findings provide initial evidence for neural correlates associated with post-retrieval processes, including decreased beta activity and microstate level differences related to the post-retrieval processing of an implicit memory.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Here we examine Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM). In this computationally grounded scheme, information is encoded in the envelope of a carrier and slower brain rhythms multiplicatively modulate the amplitude of faster rhythms, creating a cascade of nested oscillatory envelopes. This multiplicative architecture naturally produces intermodulation frequencies (of the form fc + {sum} ai fi). It predicts that oscillation frequency bands should be log-spaced (r {gtrsim} 2-3, depending on the number of modulation layers) to avoid spectral overlap, as in constant-Q filter banks, consistent with the observed logarithmic spacing of canonical brain rhythms (with ratios ~2-3). HAM's log-uniform distribution yields a 1/f global spectral profile and 1/f sideband spectra in the broadband \"aperiodic\" component, with the slope determined by modulation depth and band ratio. We then demonstrate modulation and demodulation in the laminar neural mass model (LaNMM), where a fast excitatory-inhibitory oscillator circuit couples with a slower cortical oscillator (Janse-Rit). Through the network's intrinsic nonlinearities and cross-frequency coupling, amplitude modulation and demodulation are implemented.

To understand the specific mechanisms linking ClC-5 loss-of-function with DD1 phenotypic heterogeneity, three ClC-5 pathogenic mutations (I524K, E527D and V523{triangleup}) were investigated using renal proximal tubule epithelial cell lines. We have identified distinct intracellular retention patterns of these ClC-5 mutants, all leading to altered endolysosomal pH and disrupted secretory pathway organization. Through an interactome analysis, we have uncovered several ClC-5 partners including TMEM9, which interacted with all ClC-5 forms. TMEM9 knockdown (KD) recapitulated key DD1 characteristics, like defective endocytosis and epithelial dedifferentiation, but paradoxically enhanced endosomal acidification. The secretory pathway was also altered in cells lacking TMEM9 (e.g. enlarged endosomes, and fragmented Golgi apparatus). A similar phenotype was observed in cells depleted of SEC22B; an R-SNARE that we have found to specifically interact with wild-type ClC-5, but not the mutants. Notably, its deletion impaired ClC-5 trafficking, causing its retention at the Golgi and endosomes.

This competition is commonly seen in the case of sit-and-wait (or ambush) predators. Shadow competition is closely related to the sensory capabilities of the organism, such as the range at which a predator can detect prey as well as the field of view of prey detection. Here, we develop an agent-based model whereby stationary, sit-and-wait predators exert shadow competition for prey on other predators on an explicit spatial landscape. Three predator characteristics can evolve: location, sensory radius, and field of view. We vary the number of available prey, the location of the prey source, the cost of sensory perception, and the energy requirements of the predator to find how shadow competition affects the evolved predator characteristics. We find that predators evolve a long, narrow sensory cone as a result of shadow competition, and that shadow competition greatly limits the efficiency of the predator-prey system. Thus, shadow competition, and the spatial interaction of predators in general, can dramatically shape predator phenotype and behavior.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we performed the first high-throughput paired prime editing deletion screens. To establish the technology, we generated 3,802 deletions of up to 1.2 Mb in a reporter locus in two human cell lines, and identified key determinants of paired prime editing efficiency to be deletion length, predicted pegRNA efficacy, and contact frequency. We used these learnings to generate therapeutically important deletions at rates that are expected to give clinical benefits for retinitis pigmentosa and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Combining several technological advances, we then performed the first pooled paired prime editing screen to delete over 10,471 sequences of median length 1.1 kb that target 149 genes across the genome. Our screens were high quality, recovering 75% of positive controls. We discovered 462 non-coding regions with fitness effects, and validated deletions with impact as well as tolerated ones in regions with functional annotations.

Mast cells express the highest levels of the IL-33 receptor subunit ST2 of any immune cell, and mast cells can mediate type 2 immune inflammation, however the role of IL-33-driven mast cell responses in helminth infection is poorly understood. We sought to determine the role of mast cell ST2 expression during Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) infection by generating mast cell conditional ST2 knockout (MCPT5Cre x ST2f/f, cKO) mice. These mice have normal frequencies of mast cells at steady state, but show specific and strong (albeit incomplete) knockdown of ST2 expression on mast cells. On Hpb infection, faecal egg and adult worm burden were similar between cKO and littermate controls, as were mast cell degranulation markers, serum IgE and goblet cell hyperplasia. Therefore, we conclude that mast cell ST2 does not play a dominant role in Hpb infection. To further investigate the immune response to infection in cKO and littermate controls, transcriptomic and proteomic changes were assessed in duodenal tissues in infected versus naive mice in cKO and control mice. Minimal transcriptomic and proteomic changes were seen between genotypes, whereas substantial changes were seen between naive and infected mice, regardless of genotype. Hpb infection induced local increases at the transcript and protein level for mast cell proteases (MCPT1 and MCPT2), resistin-like molecules (RELMa and RELMB), and markers such as the phospholipase PLA2G4C and the pore-forming protein gasdermin C. Bulk proteomic analysis was also searched against the Hpb genome to identify Hpb proteins present in the duodenal tissues. A list of 60 Hpb proteins of interest were identified in infected duodenal samples, of which 18 contain a signal peptide and are present in the excretory/secretory products of Hpb (HES) (likely secretory products including immunomodulatory proteins); 28 proteins are present in HES but do not contain a signal peptide (likely excretory products); and 14 proteins are not present in HES (likely proteins present in the remnants of Hpb within the duodenum).

Using Neuro2A, SH-SY5Y, N9 microglia, and primary cortical neurons, we show that JEV is packaged within sEVs (~200 nm) through an ESCRT-independent, neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2)/ceramide-dependent pathway. Virions inside sEVs display a higher JEV Premature Membrane/Membrane protein (PrM/M) ratio compared to those released via the conventional secretory pathway. Although containing a higher proportion of premature virions than mature ones, sEV-associated JEV virions gain an evolutionary advantage by evading immune detection and delivering multiple virions to recipient cells, thereby increasing overall infection efficiency. Temporal profiling showed early cytoplasmic LD enrichment (from 6 hpi), followed by a surge in sEV release from 14 hpi, suggesting sequential roles for LDs and sEVs. nSMase2 inhibition decreased sEV-mediated egress without affecting viral replication, but increased cytoplasmic LD abundance, consistent with LD underutilization in multivesicular bodies (MVB) biogenesis.

Although all four genes were present, only gene nirK and nosZ clade I were expressed. Remarkably, we found that the diurnal pattern of nirK/nosZ gene expression ratio closely aligns with the diurnal pattern of N2O flux data, with dominance of N2O production rather than N2O reduction activity driving the day-to-night variation in N2O flux. Our analysis of 1,635 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) sites indicates that partial denitrifiers followed by complete denitrifiers are key players in driving diurnal N2O variations within this acidic Arctic ecosystem, rather than nitrification processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover the microbial mechanisms underlying the diurnal dynamics of N2O flux. Our findings not only advance our understanding of nitrogen cycling in Arctic ecosystems but also underscore the critical need for similar research in diverse ecological contexts to fully grab the implications of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "Bacteria defend against hostile environments through a variety of molecular mechanisms, including ribosome hibernation. Previously, bacteria were shown to initiate ribosome hibernation by activating protective proteins known as hibernation factors. It was demonstrated that hibernation factors prevent ribosome degradation by nucleases, which allows bacteria to safely store their inactive ribosomes and survive under starvation or persistent stress. Because homologs of hibernation factors were found in diverse lineages of bacteria, it is currently assumed that the mechanism of ribosome hibernation is highly conserved across species. Here, we assess 46,015 complete bacterial genomes to reveal the principles underlying the origin and evolution of these essential proteins in bacterial cells. We find that hibernation factors emerged in ancient bacteria as relatively large proteins that then gradually reduced in size and have undergone complete extinction in over 10% of studied bacteria. We then demonstrate that the degeneration of ancient hibernation factors is often accompanied by \"borrowing\" hibernation factors from other species via gene transfers, de novo gene birth or fusion of truncated hibernation factors with fragments from other stress-response proteins. These findings reveal a unique evolutionary pathway in which bacteria respond to the reductive evolution of hibernation machinery by inventing novel hibernation mechanisms, thus restoring their capacity to survive starvation and stress. This model implies that most ribosome hibernation factors are yet to be discovered and predicts the organisms that rely on currently unknown hibernation mechanisms.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Although many bacteria harbor multiple enzymes for metabolism, the mechanisms underlying coordinated regulation remain unclear. Using the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120, we generate mutant strains with varying numbers of c-di-GMP metabolic genes deleted, including cdg0 (all degradation genes deleted) and cdgmax (all synthesis genes deleted). We found that cyclic-di-GMP is essential for both cell viability and size regulation. Quantitative analysis identified two critical physiological thresholds: one for maintaining normal cell size and a lower, lethal threshold required for survival. The 16 cyclic-di-GMP metabolic enzymes function as an electromechanical-like dual relay system, where different enzyme groups maintain cyclic-di-GMP homeostasis or activate SOS-like alarm responses when cyclic-di-GMP concentrations drop below the lethal threshold. These regulatory effects are mediated by the cyclic-di-GMP receptor CdgR, depending on the fraction of apo-CdgR form. This dual-threshold system enables dynamic cellular adaptation while preventing lethal consequences, representing a fundamental growth-survival trade-off strategy in living organisms.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

J.; Zhang, R.; Jia, Y.; Yu, W.", "abstract": "Cell wall anchored surface proteins are integral components of the Gram-positive bacterial cell envelope and are vital for bacterial survival in different environmental niches. The trafficking of many surface proteins carrying a YSIRK/G-S signal peptide is synchronized with cell envelope biogenesis during cell division, whereby YSIRK proteins traffic to the septal membrane and anchor to septal peptidoglycan (cross-wall). Previous work demonstrated that LtaS-mediated lipoteichoic acid (LTA) synthesis restricts YSIRK proteins septal trafficking. Here we did a comprehensive immunofluorescence microscopy screen of the entire S. aureus Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library (NTML) for additional factors regulating cross-wall trafficking of staphylococcal protein A (SpA), an archetype of YSIRK proteins. We characterized the top nine major hits that drastically diminished SpA cross-wall localization, including ypfP and ltaA (LTA glycolipid anchor synthesis genes), lcpB (LytR-CpsA-Psr family protein), mprF (lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol synthase), lytH (cell wall hydrolase), scdA (nitrite reductase), yjbH (protease adaptor protein ), cbiO (cobalt transporter) and SAUSA300_2311 (LytTR regulatory system) along with {Delta}tagO (wall teichoic acid synthesis). Interestingly, unlike the ltaS mutant that delocalizes SpA at both the septal membrane and peptidoglycan (PG) layer, all the hits only delocalized SpA at the PG layer, suggesting that these mutants affect the late-stage SpA trafficking. In addition, mutants of lcpB, yjbH, cbiO and 2311 exhibit both transcriptional and spatial regulation. All the hits showed defects in cell cycle, cell morphology and spatially dysregulated PG synthesis. The shared phenotypes among the mutants suggest that impaired PG homeostasis and cell cycle defects are the mechanisms underlying dysregulated SpA localization.

Here, we identify Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1), a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR), as a central effector of macrophage lysis in response to Mtb. Infection triggered NINJ1 oligomerization, and genetic or pharmacological inhibition of NINJ1 markedly reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Surprisingly, individual or combined inhibition of pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, or ferroptosis failed to prevent PMR in Mtb-infected macrophages. Instead, the ESX-1-secreted effector EsxA directly induced NINJ1 oligomerization, implicating pathogen-driven membrane damage as the upstream trigger. NINJ1 activation was independent of calcium or high-MW PEG, although PEG reduced LDH-release, implicating swelling-induced membrane changes in PMR. Cytokine release was mostly NINJ1-independent, except for CXCL-10, which was diminished in NINJ1-deficient macrophages.

Those were isolated from different aquaculture facilities (shellfish hatcheries) associated to mass mollusks mortalities from different geographical locations, years and host species. Our findings revealed an open pangenome with the 61% of the genes associated to the accessory genome that contributes to environmental and host adaptations. Phylogenomic analyses of the core-genome (39% of the pangenome size) allowed to evaluate the evolutionary history and intraspecific diversity of V. europaeus and revealed that Spanish strains displayed a much lower genetic variability than French, Chilean or American strains, probably due to a monophyletic radiation event. Functional annotation of core and accessory genes revealed the key virulence factors of the species while it also disclosed that those are located mainly into the core genes. The high number of anti-phage defense systems encoded in the accessory genome explained almost all the variability of the species.

Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) often causes severe invasive infections in community and hospital settings, typically originating from gut colonization.

Although several physical and nutrient cues influence mucoidy, the molecular mechanisms by which host-relevant signals, such as sugars, regulate this key CPS property remain undefined. Here, we show that sugar import, not catabolism, broadly suppresses hvKp mucoidy via cAMP-CRP signaling. Sugars suppress mucoidy by decreasing rmpADC promoter activity and the expression of the mucoidy regulator, rmpD. Moreover, this sugar-dependent regulation is conserved across multiple hvKp strains. hvKp associates with gut mucin and gut epithelial cells at a greater frequency when in a non-mucoid state. Together, our results suggest that sugar import broadly suppresses hvKp mucoidy and increases bacterial association to host cells.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Rotavirus outer capsid protein VP7 is an ER-resident protein. However, its N-terminal signal peptide is removed by an unknown proteolytic mechanism. In this study, we leveraged tandem affinity purification followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry to profile host proteins that interact with VP7. We identified members of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) family as important host factors that facilitate rotavirus infection. CRISPR knockout or siRNA knockdown of distinct SPC subunits resulted in significant decrease in infectious rotavirus titers in a viral strain- and cell type-independent manner. While viral transcription, translation, and replication were not altered in the absence of SPC, we observed formation of abnormal viral particles by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in SPCS1 knockout cells. Mechanistically, loss of SPC proteins led to inefficient cleavage of VP7 signal peptide and severely impaired the final steps of virion maturation and assembly. Additionally, we identified residue E256 within VP7 as a key site for SPC binding. An E to R mutation abolished VP7 interaction with SPC and subsequently led to reduced viral infectivity. Taken together, these findings define SPC as a novel regulator of VP7 maturation and rotavirus assembly and highlight its role as a novel cellular target for potentially broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Most methods to genomically estimate growth maxima include a temperature correction that accounts for the fact that organisms will grow faster at higher temperatures due to underlying reaction kinetics. Yet, this correction implies that growth-optimization need not always indicate rapid growth. For example, strong temperature gradients are the norm across much of the world's oceans, where slow-growing deep-ocean microbes appear to show elevated signals of genomic growth optimization relative to the faster-growing communities at the surface. Looking across environments, we show how a negative relationship between genomic growth optimization and optimal growth temperature leads to a decoupling of the relationship between genomic traits associated with copiotrophy and observed maximum growth rates when measured in the presence of a strong temperature gradient. We go on to show that, as a result of temperature's confounding effects, genomic signatures of growth optimization better predict the ecological roles and functional genomic content of microorganisms than do growth rates themselves. Finally, we suggest reframing copiotrophy as a set of traits that allow an organism to escape from a thermodynamic baseline maximum growth rate, rather than in relation to a specific rate cutoff.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

The contrastive deep neural network produced a near-perfect alignment of snake skin lipid and microbiome profiles for both individual snakes and disease states. BGCs from bacterial genomes isolated from snake skin overlap with metagenome profiles from wild snakes and correlate with disease state.

Yet the ecological and evolutionary processes enabling these communities to adapt to the polyextreme conditions of the continent remain largely unknown. Here, we address how horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and de novo mutations influence adaptation of microbial communities in 16 proglacial and mountainous Antarctic soils, from a combination of short- and long-read datasets. Phylogenetic reconciliation and mobile genetic element analysis of 676 metagenome-assembled genomes show that HGT events occur frequently within these microbial communities. While the transferred genes are distributed across diverse functional categories, those involved in energy metabolism are exchanged at relatively higher frequency. The genes for aerotrophy, i.e. the consumption of atmospheric trace gases to provide energy, carbon, and hydration, are among the most frequently and widely disseminated. Approximately a quarter of all carbon monoxide (CO) dehydrogenases and [NiFe]-hydrogenases that catalyze atmospheric CO and hydrogen (H2) oxidation are predicted to be horizontally acquired and are often closely associated with mobile genetic elements. In parallel, analysis of polymorphisms in protein-encoding genes suggests widespread purifying selection, demonstrated by a predominance of synonymous mutations. This selection is particularly intense for aerotrophy genes, providing further evidence that this process is critical for microbial survival in Antarctica. The genetic variation of hydrogenases is tightly associated with their predicted protein structures, with intense selection acting on critical sites that preserve their stability and function in Antarctic environments. Together, these findings show that previously unrecognised eco-evolutionary dynamics shape the composition and function of Antarctic desert microbial communities, and confirm aerotrophy is a strongly selected and horizontally disseminated trait.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

To understand the dynamics of microbiome reestablishment following disruption, we used 16S gene sequencing of the bacterial microbiome to characterize communities during recovery following antibiotic treatment. We assessed the host molecular response to microbiome depletion and recovery using RNA-seq and Western blotting of the immune transcription factor NF-{kappa}B. 16S results demonstrate that, following depletion, symbiotic Aiptasia can reestablish bacterial communities (based on diversity metrics and community composition) alike to those of controls before microbiome depletion.

Decades of research, mainly using synthetic peptides/non-native substrates that do not contain cysteines, have established the allosteric mode of DegP activation, where substrate binding remodels inactive DegP into its active conformations. In enteric bacteria, as DegP typically harbours a disulfide bond (DSB) in its protease domain, its redox-mediated activation has also been proposed. However, the cellular factors driving this activation mode and its physiological relevance have remained elusive. Here, we investigated this aspect in Escherichia coli primarily using long-chain fatty acids and alkaline pH as stressors. We show that, under these conditions, DegP considerably accumulates in its thiol form (DegPred), which represents its protease-active conformation. Besides removing damaged proteins, DegPred also induces the Cpx envelope stress response in all tested conditions. Notably, two distinct mechanisms promote redox-mediated DegP activation in a temporal and stress-specific manner: a compromised DSB-forming machinery fails to oxidize DegP, and thiol-containing substrates allosterically convert DegP into DegPred. Because in vitro, the lack of DSB sensitizes DegP to lower substrate levels, we suggest that in vivo DegPred is primed for a robust response to stresses. Finally, the diverse nature of the molecular players that activate Cpx in our tested stress conditions leads us to propose that the DSB of DegP, by acting as a redox sensor, enables DegP to integrate a wide range of inducing cues and thus work as a general protease.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Material and Methods: ATCC strains of the three organisms were grown on selective media, and cell counts determined. Untreated (control) and Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) lysed cultures were treated with varying concentrations of platinum chloride (PtCl4) and genomic DNA extracted.

We profiled circadian gene expression in the ectothermic animal Drosophila melanogaster using time-series RNA-seq of head tissues under constant darkness at 18{degrees}C, 25{degrees}C, and 29{degrees}C. Locomotion assays confirmed that behavioral rhythms were temperature compensated under these conditions.

Only 14 genes, including the core clock components period (per) and vrille (vri), oscillated across all three constant darkness conditions at different temperatures. Even among these, the phase, amplitude, and expression levels of these oscillating genes often shifted with temperature. Thus, temperature-compensated oscillating genes are rare and largely confined to core clock genes, while most oscillating genes are temperature-specific.

These properties make m6A a compelling target for eRNA-based biomonitoring. We investigated whether m6A marks can be recovered from waterborne eRNA released by an African cichlid fish during elevated temperature exposure. eRNA was collected from tank water under control and thermal treatments, enriched for methylated RNA fragments by immunoprecipitation, and sequenced using immunoprecipitation-based MeRIP-Sequencing. Using this approach, we achieved remarkably high read mapping rates to the target fish species, compared to previous studies focusing solely on mRNA sequencing.

Gene ontology analysis reveals that these are enriched in functional categories related to thermal physiology, suggesting a role in the organism's response to temperature stress. These results indicate an enormous potential of this approach to effectively and non-invasively capture signals of temperature stress response of fish via eRNA. While the current modest replicate depth constrained robust assessment of heat-associated changes in m6A, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess m6A RNA modification in the context of eRNA research and the first evidence indicating that extra-organismal eRNA can retain epitranscriptomic information.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

While OR evolution has been well studied in fully terrestrial and aquatic lineages, its dynamics in amphibious vertebrates remain less explored. Species that occupy both aquatic and terrestrial habitats span a broad phylogenetic and ecological range, from amphibians to freshwater-dwelling mammals, semi-aquatic reptiles, and shoreline birds, and are subject to the functional demands of odour detection across two chemically disparate milieus. Here, we analysed OR gene repertoires across 230 vertebrate genomes, including 138 amphibious species. Our results show that OR repertoire expansion is not a uniform feature of terrestrial adaptation but is most pronounced in amphibious lineages, particularly those inhabiting freshwater systems, where chemically variable environments likely impose stronger selective pressures on olfaction. These expansions are primarily driven by lineage-specific expansions and correlate with ecologies that require sensing a wide range of chemical cues. While amphibious marine taxa possess larger OR repertoires than their fully marine relatives, they consistently exhibit fewer ORs than freshwater amphibious vertebrates. More broadly, species that rely on other sensory modalities, such as echolocation, electroreception, or vision, tend to exhibit reduced OR repertoires. Despite this diversity, several amphibious and terrestrial species within the same clade retain a small subset of shared OR genes, reflecting the retention of conserved OR orthologs (potentially those tuned to airborne odorants) across habitat transitions. However, overlap across clades is minimal, reflecting independent evolutionary responses to similar ecological pressures. Overall, our findings highlight amphibious lifestyles as key inflection points in vertebrate olfactory evolution, driving both OR repertoire expansion and divergence through the interplay of habitat complexity, sensory trade-offs, and lineage-specific constraints.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Genomic prediction (GP), a tool that uses genome wide markers, can be employed to predict the performance of untested hybrids based on general combining ability (GCA) of their parents. We investigated the potential of GP for GCA prediction in a commercial canola breeding program. We used female tester data, where many female lines are crossed with few male lines, to predict economically important traits in canola. Multi-year and location data for grain yield, oil, protein, days to flowering, days to maturity, total glucosinate and saturated fat were available for prediction. Three different cross-validation strategies were implemented to determine the predictive ability (PA) of each trait. In the first cross-validation scheme (CV1), a prediction model was validated using five-fold cross validation strategy. In the second cross-validation scheme (CV2), an unseen year was predicted using the previous years data as a training set. In the third cross-validation scheme (CV3), Inbred pe se performance was added to the training set to exploit the covariance between traits of inbred and hybrid trials. The highest PA was observed for CV1 while the lowest PA was seen for CV2. In CV1, PA ranged from 0.34 to 0.62. The highest PA was observed for protein (0.62) while the lowest PA was observed for days to maturity (0.34). For CV2, PA ranged from 0.16 to 0.46, while for CV3 PA ranged from 0.27 to 0.71. The highest PA for CV2 (0.46) and CV3 (0.71) was observed for total glucosinate while the lowest PA (0.16 CV2 and 0.27 -CV3) was for days to maturity. The current study demonstrates the potential of using marker information to select parents with the highest GCA to create the best hybrid combinations.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

QueC family proteins are nucleoside biosynthesis enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of queuosine, a 7-deazaguanine derivative. Recently, QueC-family proteins were shown to catalyze a deazaguanylation protein-nucleobase conjugation reaction in type IV CBASS antiphage defense. However, the mechanism of QatABCD, even the function of QatC in this system, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that QatBCD forms a complex in which QatD is highly flexible. Crystal structures of the QatBC complex in apo and ATP-bound form support a shared role for QueC-family proteins in targeting protein substrates for N-terminal modification as in type IV CBASS. We show that the QatB N-terminal loop, its binding with QatC and QatC catalytic site are essential for QatABCD defense in vivo, suggesting a modification might occur analogous to CBASS.

Here, we introduce Restriction Endonuclease Digestion (RED), a simple and cost-effective method to generate 15N-labeled ssDNA. This approach combines molecular cloning and enzymatic design processing by propagating plasmids in E. coli cultured with 15NH4Cl, followed by double restriction digestion and isolation target 15N-ssDNA. Using RED, we produced milligram-scale quantities of 96%-enriched 15N-labeled human telomeric G4 ssDNA (wtTel23c, CTAGGG(TTAGGG)3), ideal for NMR analysis. The NMR spectra revealed that wtTel23c adopts G4 topology and undergoes multiple conformations of wtTel23c in potassium-containing solutions and in Xenopus laevis cell lysate.

The AA14 LPMO family is widely distributed in filamentous fungi but remains enigmatic as its initially-suspected substrate specificity was recently challenged. In this study, we investigated the disordered C-terminal regions (dCTRs), found in more than half of AA14 family members and hypothesized to have functional relevance. Focusing on the Pycnoporus coccineus AA14A LPMO, we used small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and circular dichroism to show that its dCTR is highly disordered. It consists of a heavily glycosylated low complexity region followed by a charged C-terminal tail. We uncovered that the PcoAA14A dCTR binds copper ions through histidine residues located in the C-terminal tail. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), we further demonstrated that dimer formation occurs through an oxidative process involving copper and a redox-sensitive cysteine. Noting similarities between the last residues of the C-terminal tail and antimicrobial peptides, we investigated its potential antimicrobial function. We found that the positively charged region of the C-terminal tail selectively inhibits the growth of basidiomycete fungal spores.

Protonation of this residue blocks complex formation in silico, explaining the release of HKI from mitochondria observed upon cytosolic acidification. To validate these findings, we here developed an in vitro assay for interrogating HKI binding to VDAC1 reconstituted in vesicles captured on a functionalized surface. TIRF-based quantitative interaction studies with a fluorescent peptide comprising the N-terminal -helix of HKI revealed a crucial role of the bilayer-facing glutamate in complex assembly and recapitulated an exquisite sensitivity of HKI-VDAC binding to fluctuations in pH.

We built an acyl-CoA ligase-deficient chassis of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, thereby blocking 3-HFA activation and preventing its use as carbon source. This strategy decoupled synthesis from catabolism and enabled 3-HFA accumulation. We then compared two different routes for modifying the free 3-HFA composition. 1. In a direct route, overexpressing native PhaG produced C8, C10, C12, and C14 3-HFAs, achieving a total titer of 0.73 g/L in shake flasks. Functional analyses under our tested conditions support a re-assignment of PhaG: rather than acting primarily as a 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP:CoA transacylase, it functions mainly as a thioesterase, liberating free 3-HFAs from hydroxyacyl-ACP. 2. In an indirect route, overexpressing RhlA variants generated hydroxyalkanoyl-alkanoates (HAAs) that were converted to free 3-HFAs by endogenous esterase(s): RhlA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 favored C8-C12 and yielded 0.47 g/L 3-HFAs, whereas RhlA from Burkholderia plantarii PG1 favored C10-C14 with 0.14 g/L, of which 80% was C14.

A previous cryo-EM structure of CCAN bound to a CENP-ANuc reconstituted with a 171 bp -satellite repeat sequence showed how extranucleosomal linker DNA threads through an internal tunnel in the CCAN complex. To understand the higher-order architecture of the inner kinetochore assembled onto -satellite repeat arrays we have determined cryo-EM structures of CCAN with longer DNA sequences. These include free DNA and single and dimeric -satellite repeats with CENP-A nucleosomes. We show from the structures of CCAN bound to both free DNA and monomeric CENP-ANuc that CCAN engages 65-70 bp of DNA comprising 30-35 bp of an upstream -satellite repeat. This upstream DNA interacts with the histone fold domain subunits of the CENP-TWSX module in a manner resembling how DNA is wrapped in nucleosomes. A complex of CCAN assembled onto a dimeric -satellite repeat with two CENP-A nucleosomes showed that CCAN can only be accommodated on the linker DNA by unwrapping DNA from the CENP-TWSX module together with 25 bp of DNA from the upstream nucleosome.

In organisms where sex is infrequent, these impacts of sexual selection are likely to be limited. An increased frequency of obligate sex would increase the opportunity for sexual selection, which could promote the evolution of sexual traits and sexual differentiation. To study these dynamics, we conducted experimental evolution in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is predominantly asexual, with two isogamous mating types. We used selectable markers to impose frequent obligate sex in 96 populations. We manipulated the opportunity for sexual selection by imposing skewed mating-type ratios and by altering the degree to which mating occurred by selfing versus outcrossing. After just ten sexual cycles, we observed evolution in growth, cell size, pheromone production, and mating, with the mating types responding asymmetrically, but little evolutionary change in sporulation rate. Mating type dimorphism increased, with evident trade-offs between growth, attractiveness, and cell size. Genome sequences from a subset of populations revealed many mutations affecting sex-related genes. Unexpectedly, the selfing populations evolved to become sporulation-competent haploids, unlinking meiosis from ploidy change.

This study aimed to determine if the oral cavity is a source of circulating microbial DNA translocation in individuals with current cocaine use disorder (COC). Design: A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted, comparing COC and demographically matched non-drug controls. All participants were recruited at the Medical University of South Carolina. Setting: Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Participants: Ten COC (via smoking or vaping) and 24 controls provided paired saliva and blood samples. Measurements: Microbial 16S rRNA V4 region was sequenced in isolated microbial DNA from saliva and plasma. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was analyzed in human PBMCs. Findings: Saliva from COC, but not plasma, exhibited reduced alpha diversity and altered beta diversity, characterized by enriched Streptococcus and depleted Fusobacterium and other taxa relative to controls. Controls exhibited low to undetectable microbial translocation in plasma. By contrast, plasma Streptococcus and several S. species displayed COC-specific oral enrichment and evidence of translocation into the bloodstream. In vitro, cocaine selectively enhanced S. parasanguinis growth, consistent with COC-enriched oral pathobionts and translocation into circulation in vivo. S. parasanguinis, but not cocaine alone, induced IL-1{beta} and TNF- production in human primary monocytes. scRNAseq further revealed innate immune activation, impaired T cell function, and heightened susceptibility to infection in COC.

Hence we re-engineered rVSV to be non-cytolytic (rVSVMq). This vector induced more durable and effector-differentiated CD8 T cell memory than the parental rVSV and it afforded superior protection against Listeria challenge. Improved CD8 T cell responses of non-cytolytic rVSVMq were driven by a reinforced type I interferon (IFN-I) response and its direct sensing by vaccination-induced CD8 T cells. Many vector cargo-specific CD8 T cells in the splenic marginal zone of rVSVMq- or rLCMV-vaccinated mice were in contact with vector cargo-expressing cells that co-expressed type I interferon. In contrast, rVSV-vectored cargo-expressing contacts of specific CD8 T cells were largely IFN type I-negative.

It has been hypothesized that selection for antigenic variants may occur during the establishment of a new infection, rather than over time in a single host. Here, we leveraged a large household cohort study to assess whether selection was detectable between acutely infected hosts. We investigated influenza A virus evolution using specimens from 384 children and household contacts with RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A infection, representing infections with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses from 2017-19. In agreement with prior studies, we found that acute infections involved weak purifying selection across the viral genome. In addition, we identified 40 transmission events occurring in 31 households. During transmission, evolution between hosts was characterized by tight transmission bottlenecks and weak purifying selection. We found variability in the strength and direction of selection on antigenic regions of HA, but no clear evidence for selection of antigenic variants during transmission.

To address this gap, we developed VirTarget, the first virus-informed pharmacogenomics network framework that systematically evaluates approved MS immunotherapies with respect to EBV-driven pathogenesis and host genetic susceptibility risk. Methods: VirTarget integrates three complementary layers: (1) EBV-host interactomics, mapping viral-host protein-protein interactions within MS-relevant pathways; (2) host genetic susceptibility, linking MS-associated variants to EBV-targeted, therapy-modulated networks; and (3) transcriptomics directionality analysis, contrasting drug signatures with the convergent MS--EBV transcriptomic signature to classify therapies as reinforcers or reversers. Results: Network analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity among therapies. Dimethyl fumarate showed the strongest and broadest engagement with the MS--EBV network, followed by natalizumab and interferons, while anti-CD20 antibodies and S1P modulators exerted the weakest effects. Genetic mapping highlighted convergence on key risk genes (HLA-DRB1, IL7R, IL2RA, CD40, TYR) directly targeted by EBV proteins within therapy-modulated pathways. Transcriptomic profiling stratified therapies into reinforcers (e.g., dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, dexamethasone, interferon-{beta}1b) and reversers (e.g., prednisolone, cladribine, interferon-{beta}1a, rituximab), reflecting opposing influences on the MS{cap}EBV signature. Notably, multiple therapies reversed EBV-driven dysregulation of cytokine and innate immune pathways, suggesting their benefits extend in counteracting viral-mediated modulation of immune processes. Conclusion: VirTarget provides the first systems-level, virus-informed comparative map of how MS immunotherapies engage with the MS--EBV network, intersect with MS genetic susceptibility risk, and modulate both MS- and EBV-related transcriptomic signatures. By revealing drug-specific patterns of viral pathway engagement and genetic convergence, this framework establishes a foundation for precision treatment strategies in MS, where therapeutic selection is informed by viral serostatus, host genetics, and system-level transcriptomic responses.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Clethrionomys glareolus) are frequently used as an animal model in ecological and biomedical studies, and are important reservoir of viral and bacterial zoonotic pathogens, e.g. of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV). Here we describe an accidental PUUV outbreak in a large bank vole laboratory colony by incursion of infected wild-trapped bank voles, and a successful eradication of the virus. The eradication plan was based on results of previous studies, which showed that maternal antibodies (MatAb) protect the young from infection for up to 40 days after the weaning, four weeks longer than the estimated duration of maintaining infectivity of PUUV in the environment. After ensuring that most animals are infected, 620 pairs were mated on the same day. Only females that showed PUUV-specific antibodies and gave offspring within 26 days after the mating were retained. All individuals of the parental generation were euthanized before the last weaning. The weaned offspring was moved to individually ventilated cages (IVC) and repeatedly tested for the presence of PUUV-specific antibodies and RNA. A few infected and suspicious animals were euthanised. Then the animals were mated (in IVC) and after producing grand-offspring euthanised and tested for PUUV RNA in lungs. No PUUV RNA was detected, and no animals showed PUUV-specific antibodies in next generations. The successful clearance confirmed the protective efficiency of PUUV-specific MatAb. The procedure for clearance of PUUV in the bank vole colony may represent a blueprint for similar approaches in precious colonies of other rodents infected by similar pathogens.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

C. elegans with its complete connectome, genetically identifiable neurons, single-cell transcriptome, neuropeptide-receptor distribution, and an amenability to simultaneous measurement of brain-wide neural activity and behavior presents a unique opportunity for such a multiscale circuit analysis. However, the absence of a unifying framework to connect these diverse datasets limits our ability to connect network structure and attributes with function. Here we introduce CeDNe - C.elegans Dynamical Network, an open-source computational framework that integrates anatomical, molecular, and imaging datasets into a unified graph-based representation that enables multimodal data analysis by cross-referencing different omics layers in a single computational environment. Specifically, CeDNe provides modular tools for visualizing and analyzing network connectivity, motif distribution, and circuit paths. Further, it incorporates a computational framework that simulates neural dynamics and optimizes network models to bridge structural connectivity with neural activity. Thus, CeDNe establishes a scalable foundation for data-driven modeling of the nervous system. This open-source tool not only facilitates computational connectomics and multimodal analyses in C. elegans, but also serves as a generalizable framework for investigating structure-function relationships in neural networks of other organisms.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

However, despite being discovered more than a decade ago, the IGHV1-69-encoded CR9114 remains the only HA stem bnAb that cross-reacts with both influenza A and B viruses. To investigate the constraints on the breadth evolution of CR9114, this study performs four deep mutational scanning experiments to compare the binding affinity landscapes of the germline and somatic CR9114 against H1 HA, H3 HA, and influenza B HA. Many mutations that minimally affect or even improve the H1 HA binding are detrimental for binding to H3 HA and BHA. We further reveal the prevalence of epistasis in IGHV1-69 HA stem bnAbs. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the scarcity of HA stem bnAbs with cross-reactivity against both influenza A and B viruses, and have important implications for developing broadly protective influenza vaccines.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

R.; Montefiori, D.; Janes, H.", "abstract": "HIV viruses that establish infection possess phenotypic and genotypic characteristics that have been selected for and that differ across transmission routes, including their susceptibility to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). While sexually transmitted viruses have been well characterized, studies of vertically transmitted viruses are sparse and from cohorts that are often small in size and more than a decade old. To investigate whether viruses transmitted vertically during lactation possess distinct neutralization profiles compared to viruses transmitted sexually, we compared the neutralization sensitivity of 25 clade C breastmilk viruses to that of 99 contemporaneous clade C viruses from sera of adults with sexual acquisition against three bnAbs in clinical development. Three out of 7 breastmilk donors (43%) had one or more viruses resistant to 2 or more bnAbs, compared to 8 out of 99 (8%) contemporaneous adult viruses (p=0.02). Breastmilk viruses were more resistant to PGT121 and VRC07.523 (median IC80 >50 compared to 1.16 for PGT121, and 12.75 vs. 0.38 for VRC07.523; p=0.013 and <0.001 respectively), and more breastmilk viruses than adult viruses were resistant to VRC07.523 (94% vs. 43%, p=0.001). Interestingly, the breastmilk viruses most resistant to VRC07.523 had on average one or more glycans in V3 compared to adult transmitted viruses (median 3 vs. 2 glycosylation sites, including flanking position 295; p=0.009), and the number of V3 glycans was negatively correlated with VRC07.523 sensitivity (p=0.007). These findings highlight potential differences in bnAb susceptibility of vertically transmitted viruses and emphasize the need to increase sequencing efforts and screening of infant viruses to better inform the efficacy of candidate bnAbs to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

This study demonstrates that ILC2 can block re-infection and limit tissue injury caused by the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb). TH2 cells were necessary during initial antigen encounter but dispensable for pathogen clearance and lung repair after ILC2 priming. Upon re-infection, trained ILC2 selectively blocked interleukin (IL)-17+ {gamma}{delta}T cell expansion and infection-induced lung injury through an Amphiregulin (Areg)-independent mechanism. Trained ILC2s had a distinct metabolic gene expression profile marked by elevated tryptophan hydroxylase 1(Tph1), and pulmonary serotonin levels were largely ILC2-dependent. Surprisingly, serotonin prevented IL-17-associated lung hemorrhage irrespective of parasite load. We propose that TH2-ILC2 interactions drive pathogen control, but ILC2 distinctly control lung tissue repair through serotonin.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

A.; Bitter, M. C.; Berardi, S.; Oken, H.; Beltz, J. K.; Petrov, D. A.; Schmidt, P.", "abstract": "The extent to which adaptation can be predicted, particularly for traits with complex genetic bases, is unknown. Here, we leveraged a model complex trait, model species, and high-powered longitudinal sampling design to test the efficacy of genomic prediction of complex trait variation and evolution in ecologically relevant settings. We monitored genome-wide allele frequencies and pigmentation variation in genetically diverse populations of Drosophila melanogaster across seven generations of evolution in both field mesocosms exposed to natural environmental fluctuations, as well as mesocosms housed in a controlled, lab-based setting. At two time points throughout trait evolution, we conducted a high-powered, tail-based mapping of pigmentation. We produced a well-resolved genotype-phenotype map that reaffirms canonical pigmentation genes and unveils novel loci underpinning a substantial portion of trait variation. While we were able to use this map to correctly infer the direction of pigmentation evolution in both the field and lab mesocosms, the particular loci responding to selection, and thus architecture of adaptation itself, were largely unpredictable. We suggest this unpredictability to be a result of pleiotropic constraint, which was more pronounced in the field, relative to the lab-based, environment. Finally, we quantified a striking stability of the genotype-phenotype map across genetically diverged populations, demonstrating that shifting epistatic landscapes associated with the evolutionary process itself does not alter trait architecture to an extent that precludes phenotypic prediction, provided the mapping is sufficiently powered. In concert our results highlight both the promise and limitations of genomic prediction, and exemplify the challenges of applying lab-based studies of complex traits to their evolutionary dynamics in the wild.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}

Nonetheless, some species have adapted successfully to these conditions. We investigate the population genomic structure, evolutionary history and phenotypic differentiation of three diploid generalist plant species, Lavandula stoechas L., Halimium atriplicifolium (Lam) Spach. subsp. atriplicifolium, and Phlomis purpurea L., all of which inhabit adjacent serpentine and non-serpentine soils in the Malaga region in the southern Iberian Peninsula (Spain). We explore whether populations from serpentine and non-serpentine soils represent distinct evolutionary lineages and whether there is genomic and phenotypic differentiation associated with serpentine conditions. We measured plant height and specific leaf area (SLA) to detect potential ecotypic variation associated with soil type. A ddRADseq SNP dataset was generated for each species, representing 10 populations from serpentine and 10 from non-serpentine soils. We ordinated genotype data to assess genomic variation, conducted an ADMIXTURE analysis to infer ancestral groups, and used Treemix analyses to investigate phylogenetic relationships and gene flow events between populations. Isolation by distance (IBD) analyses evaluated the role of geographic separation in observed genomic differentiation. Our results reveal species-specific patterns of genomic, and to some extent phenotypic, differentiation between serpentine and non-serpentine populations, with evidence of multiple colonisations of serpentine sites in all three species. The study highlights the role of historical differentiation and subsequent gene flow in shaping the genomic structure of plant populations, alongside observed variation in phenotypic traits across environments.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Evolution under Stochastic Transmission: Mutation-Rate Modifiers", "doi": "10.1101/2025.11.04.686407", "authors": "Feldman, M. W.; Heinrich-Mora, E.", "abstract": "In evolutionary models of large populations, it is common to analyze the effects of cyclic or random variation in the parameters that describe selection. It is less common, however, to study how stochasticity in the genetic transmission process itself affects evolutionary outcomes. Suppose that a gene locus has alleles A and a under constant selection. This locus is linked to a modifier locus with alleles M1 and M2, which control the mutation rate from A to a. The Reduction Principle states that, near a mutation-selection balance where M1 is fixed with mutation rate u1, a rare allele M2 can invade if its associated rate u2 is lower than u1. This result, valid for both haploids and diploids, assumes constant mutation rates through time. We extend this framework by allowing the mutation rate associated with M2 to fluctuate randomly across generations, denoted as u2,t. In this stochastic setting, the condition for invasion by a new modifier allele depends not only on the resident mutation rate u1 and the mean mutation rate u2 associated with the invading allele, but also on the temporal distribution of u2,t, the strength of selection at the A/a locus, and the recombination rate between M1/M2 and A/a. The analysis shows how stochasticity and recombination in transmission do not simply modify the magnitude of evolutionary change predicted under deterministic assumptions. Instead, through their interaction with selection and linkage, they can generate conditions under which the direction of modifier evolution is qualitatively reversed relative to the deterministic Reduction Principle.", "date": "2025-11-04", "journal": ""}
