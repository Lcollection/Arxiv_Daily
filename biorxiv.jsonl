M.; Bhatt, P. S.; Moseley, H. N. B.", "abstract": "Background: Almost all correlation measures currently available are unable to directly handle missing values. Typically, missing values are either ignored completely by removing them or are imputed and used in the calculation of the correlation coefficient. In either case, the correlation value will be impacted based on a perspective that the missing data represents no useful information. However, missing values occur in real data sets for a variety of reasons. In omics data sets that are derived from analytical measurements, a major reason for missing values is that a specific measurable phenomenon falls below the detection limits of the analytical instrumentation (left-censored values). These missing data are not missing at random, but represent useful information by virtue of their \"missingness\" at one end of the data distribution. Results: To include this information due to left-censorship missingness, we propose the information-content-informed Kendall-tau (ICI-Kt) methodology. We show how left-censored missing values can be included within the definition of the Kendall-tau correlation coefficient, and how that inclusion leads to an interpretation of information being added to the correlation. We also implement calculations for additional measures of theoretical maxima and pairwise completeness that add further layers of information interpretation in the methodology. Using both simulated and real data sets from RNA-seq, metabolomics, and lipidomics experiments, we demonstrate that the ICI-Kt methodology allows for the inclusion of left-censored missing data values as interpretable information, enabling both improved determination of outlier samples and improved feature-feature network construction. We provide explicitly parallel implementations in both R and Python that allow fast calculations of all the variables used when applying the ICI-Kt methodology on large numbers of samples. Conclusions: The ICI-Kt methods are available as an R package and Python module on GitHub at https://github.com/moseleyBioinformaticsLab/ICIKendallTau and https://github.com/moseleyBioinformaticsLab/icikt, respectively.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

P.; Meek, J.; Olhede, S.; Fabrizi, L.", "abstract": "In the developing cortex of preterm human infants, neuronal activity is discontinuous - characterized by sudden, high-amplitude bursts that interrupt periods of quiet background activity. While the functional significance of these bursts is well established, the underlying cause remains unclear. We propose that this burst - quiescence pattern arises from a temporary \"refractoriness\" in cortical networks following spontaneous activation. To investigate this, we examined whether spontaneous activity in sensory networks reduces their excitability by assessing how ongoing brain activity influences responses to external sensory stimuli. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to tactile stimulation of the hands and feet in 35 preterm infants, with a median post-menstrual age of 32 weeks. This stimulation triggered increases in wideband cortical power, showing two distinct peaks: one in the delta range and another in the alpha-beta range. Delta-band activity is widespread across the scalp, while the faster alpha-beta responses were confined to somatotopically specific regions. Importantly, we found that when the baseline activity shared similar spectral and spatial characteristics with the evoked somatosensory response, the magnitude of the evoked response was reduced. This suggests that spontaneous events transiently engage and saturate both widespread (tangential) and localized (columnar) cortical circuits. As a result, the same cortical regions become temporarily less responsive - a form of refractoriness - preventing immediate reactivation. This mechanism may explain the cyclical pattern of bursting and quiescence observed in the preterm brain.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

To date, it is still poorly understood whether inter-individual differences in patterns of S-A axis capture these robust spatial relationships across neurobiological properties observed at the group-level. Here, we examine inter-individual differences in structural and functional properties of the S-A axis, namely cortical microstructure, geodesic distances, and the functional gradient, in a sample of young adults from the Human Connectome Project (N = 992, including 328 twins). We quantified heritable variation associated with inter-individual differences in the S-A axis, and assessed whether structural and functional properties that are highly spatially correlated at the group-level also share genetic underpinnings. To consider measurement errors in resting-state functional connectivity data and their impact on properties of the S-A axis, we used a multivariate twin design capable of disentangling individual-level variation in both intra- and inter-individual differences. After accounting for some of the intra-individual variation, we found average heritable individual differences in both the functional gradient (htwin2 = 57%), cortical microstructure (htwin2= 43%), and geodesic distances (htwin2 = 34%). However, these genetic influences were mostly distinct and deviated from group-level patterns. In particular, we found no significant genetic correlation between the functional gradient and microstructure, while we found both positive and negative genetic associations between the functional gradient and geodesic distances. Our approach highlights the complexity of genetic contributions to brain organisation and may have potential implications for understanding cognitive variability within the S-A axis framework.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

The structural mechanism that underlies how RBM15 interacts with RNA has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we mined and bioinformatically assessed publicly available genome-wide RNA 2D structural probing and RBP cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data to investigate how RBM15 interacts with RNA, with a focus on lncRNA transcripts. RBM15, which possesses three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), primarily interacts with stem-loop structured RNA motifs. Structural modeling reveals RRMs 2 and 3 are coaxially stacked in solution; these two RRMs are responsible for driving RBM15's interaction with RNA. We further demonstrate this experimentally with two RNA hairpins, revealing low micromolar binding affinities.

While previous studies have delved into this phenomenon, distinguishing the processing of real-world size from other visual properties, like depth, has been challenging. Using the THINGS EEG2 dataset with human EEG recordings and more ecologically valid naturalistic stimuli, our study combines human EEG and representational similarity analysis to disentangle neural representations of object real-world size from retinal size and perceived depth, leveraging recent datasets and modeling approaches to address challenges not fully resolved in previous work. We report a representational timeline of visual object processing: object real-world depth processed first, then retinal size, and finally, real-world size. Additionally, we input both these naturalistic images and object-only images without natural background into artificial neural networks. Consistent with the human EEG findings, we also successfully disentangled representation of object real-world size from retinal size and real-world depth in all three types of artificial neural networks (visual-only ResNet, visual-language CLIP, and language-only Word2Vec). Moreover, our multi-modal representational comparison framework across human EEG and artificial neural networks reveals real-world size as a stable and higher-level dimension in object space incorporating both visual and semantic information. Our research provides a temporally resolved characterization of how certain key object properties - such as object real-world size, depth, and retinal size - are represented in the brain, which offers further advances and insights into our understanding of object space and the construction of more brain-like visual models.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Neural activity synchronized to speech, also termed ''neural speech tracking'', is thought to be instrumental for this purpose. However, the relative contribution of neural tracking of targets and distractors for speech perception in a setting with multiple competing speakers remained unclear. In 61 human participants, we used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to manipulate neural tracking of two simultaneously presented sequences of rhythmic speech while participants attended to one of them. A random temporal relationship between speech streams allowed us to disentangle effects of tACS on target and distractor processing, and to examine their combined effect on a behavioural measure of speech perception. We found that the phase relation between tACS and both target and distracting speech modulated word report accuracy to a similar degree. This effect was observed during bilateral tACS over auditory regions, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and, importantly, in a control group that received near-identical cutaneous stimulation but ~50% reduced brain stimulation. These results imply that, although neural tracking of both target- and distracting speech causally modulates speech perception, the cutaneous stimulation that goes along with tACS can cause phase effects in speech perception that resemble those for conventional tACS. Our finding illustrates the urgent need to control for cutaneous stimulation in tACS studies.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Recently developed machine learning methods, such as deep learning and gradient boosting, are transforming the real world. These methods could advance QTL mapping methodologies because of their high capability for capturing complex relationships among features. One problem with applying such complex models to QTL mapping is the evaluation of feature importance. In this study, XGBoost, a popular gradient tree boosting algorithm, was applied for QTL mapping in biparental populations with Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs). SHAP is a local (i.e., instance-wise) importance index with the desired properties as feature importance indices. The SHAP-assisted XGBoost (SHAP-XGB) was compared with conventional methods, including composite interval mapping (CIM), multiple interval mapping (MIM), inclusive CIM (ICIM), and BayesC, using simulations and rice heading date data. SHAP-XGB performed comparablely to CIM, MIM, ICIM, and BayesC in mapping main QTL effects and was superior to MIM, ICIM, and BayesC in mapping QTL interaction effects. As SHAP can evaluate local importance, interactions between markers can be visualized by plotting SHAP interaction values for each instance (plant/line). These results illustrated the strength of SHAP-XGB in detecting and interpreting epistatic QTLs and suggest the possibility that SHAP-XGB complements conventional methods.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

These reproductive modes are associated with a range of floral and other life-history traits. While several theories have sought to explain how these correlations arose, many questions remain open, particularly because these traits themselves have not evolved independently from one another. These observations stress the need for an integrative analysis of plant traits to determine whether the vast array of trait associations can be summarized as major reproductive strategies, which we perform here. We assembled a set of 361 species representative of flowering plant diversity and 21 traits including those related to flowers, pollination, mating and sexual systems as well as classical life history traits. As expected, outcrossing was mainly found among long-lived, large-stature plants, but hermaphroditic (monoclinous) outcrossers and dioecious species were remarkably distinct in the trait space. Level of floral investment seemed to be the main difference between these strategies, with dioecious species having smaller, less rewarding flowers in general, a pattern that was not only typical of abiotic pollination but present in biotically pollinated species as well. This work adds to growing evidence that floral and pollination traits can yield new insights into the evolution and ecology of flowering plants, and we argue that the important variation they underlie must be accounted for going forward. Based on our findings, we propose a conceptual framework that will help understand how different traits contribute to reproductive strategies.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Here we show that Eed, a core subunit of PRC2, is required for craniofacial osteoblast differentiation and mesenchymal proliferation after induction of the neural crest. Integrating mouse genetics with single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetic profiling, our results reveal that conditional knockout of Eed after neural crest cell induction causes severe craniofacial hypoplasia, impaired craniofacial osteogenesis, and attenuated craniofacial mesenchymal cell proliferation that is first evident in post-migratory neural crest cell populations. We show that Eed drives mesenchymal differentiation and proliferation in vivo and in primary craniofacial cell cultures by epigenetically regulating diverse transcription factor programs that are required for specification of post-migratory neural crest cells.

Although 3.7% of disease-relevant human mutations occur in UTRs, their exact role in pathogenesis remains unclear. Through metagene analysis, we mapped pathogenic UTR mutations to regions near coding sequences, with a focus on the upstream open reading frame (uORF) initiation site. Subsequently, we utilized massively parallel poly(ribo)some profiling to compare the ribosome associations of 6,555 pairs of wildtype and mutant UTR fragments. We identified 46 UTR variants that altered polysome profiles, with enrichment in pathogenic mutations. Both univariate analysis and the elastic net regression model highlighted the significance of motifs of short repeated sequences, including SRSF2 binding sites, as mutation hotspots that lead to aberrant translation. Furthermore, these polysome-shifting mutations exhibited considerable impact on RNA secondary structures, particularly for upstream AUG-containing 5' UTRs. Integrating these features, our model achieved high accuracy (AUROC > 0.8) in predicting polysome-shifting mutations in the test dataset. Additionally, several lines of evidence indicate that changes in uORF usage underlie the translation deficiency arising from these mutations. Illustrating this, we demonstrate that a pathogenic mutation in the IRF6 5' UTR suppresses translation of the primary open reading frame by creating a uORF. Remarkably, site-directed ADAR editing of the mutant mRNA rescued this translation deficiency.

Across all phenotypic assays, tachyzoite replication, nucleoside-analogue sensitivity, alkaline-stress-induced differentiation, and murine cyst formation, the dTgENT2 strain was indistinguishable from the parental line, indicating that TgENT2 is dispensable under the conditions tested. In contrast, the double mutant dTgAT1dTgENT3 exhibited delayed bradyzoite differentiation in vitro and produced smaller brain cysts in vivo. This double deletion triggered a ~3-fold transcriptional up-regulation of TgENT1, whose product we partially localized to the plant-like vacuolar compartment (PLVAC). Conditional depletion of TgENT1 caused complete intracellular growth arrest, PLVAC swelling, and a purine-starvation-like transcriptomic program enriched for nucleoside phosphatases and cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterases. These findings reveal a compensatory salvage pathway in which the parasite reroutes purine acquisition through a vacuolar route when plasma-membrane import is compromised. Although this adaptation sustains tachyzoite proliferation, it fails during the energetically demanding transition to bradyzoites, creating a metabolic bottleneck that impairs chronic infection.

We surveyed the gut bacterial communities of Mexican honey wasps across sites within Texas using 16S rRNA profiling, and we estimated bacterial titer per bee using qPCR. For comparison, we also surveyed non-honey feeding wasps from six families, collected in the same region. We found that honey wasp communities are dominated by characteristic bacterial species. In contrast, other wasps had lower absolute titers and more variable communities, dominated by environmental bacteria. Honey wasps from all sampled nests contained strains of Bifidobacterium and Bombilactobacillus that were closely related to symbionts of bumble bees and other bees, suggesting acquisition via host-switching. Some individuals also harbored a close relative of Candidatus Schmidhempelia bombi (Orbaceae), an uncultured bumble bee symbiont, again suggesting host-switching. The most prevalent species was an uncultured Lactobacillus that potentially represents an independent acquisition of environmental Lactobacillus.

The SWI has proved difficult to explain via traditional Bayesian models, which predict the opposite effect: expected weight from size (smaller = lighter) should be integrated with felt weight, such that the smaller object should be perceptually lighter. Other authors have proposed that weight and density are combined according to Bayesian principles, or that Bayesian models incorporating efficient coding can predict the SWI via 'likelihood repulsion'. These models, however, have been evaluated only under the narrow conditions of typical SWI stimuli. Here we establish a general model of perceived weight for pairs of objects that differ in weight and / or density and / or size by varying amounts. In a visuo-haptic task, participants (N = 30) grasped and lifted pairs of cubes, and reported their perceived heaviness. We report that the SWI occurs even at very small density differences, repudiating the idea that the illusion requires a large difference between expected and felt weight. Across all object pairs, perceived weight was well described by a model (R2 = .98) that includes a positive influence of both objects' weights and the judged object's density, but a negative influence of the other object's density. Critically, the influence of both densities on perceived weight is strongly modulated by weight difference, being three times as large for zero / small weight differences than for large differences. Thus, it is only under the unusual conditions of typical SWI studies that density affects perceived weight to a substantial extent. Unlike existing models, that are inconsistent with our more comprehensive dataset, our descriptive model provides a quantitative, accurate and generalised account of weight perception for pairs of objects across various weight and size conditions.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

We select a variety of commonly used SDM algorithms to construct an ensemble forecasting framework aimed at predicting the potential climatic habitats for each species under both historical (1981-2010) and future (2071-2100) climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5), and how these changes might influence the habitat suitability of flower and insect species within their symbolic states and across the United States. Our results indicate that 30-66% of state flowers and 18-51% of state insects are projected to experience substantial losses of climatically suitable habitat within their symbolic states. Under the high-emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), ten state flowers and three state insects are likely to face local extinction by the 2080s.

The Fmr1 KO mice exhibited fragmented sleep, impaired locomotor rhythmicity, and attenuated behavioral responses to light, linked to an abnormal retinal innervation and reduction of light-evoked neuronal activation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Behavioral testing revealed significant deficits in social memory and increased repetitive behaviors in the mutants, which correlated with sleep fragmentation. Remarkably, a scheduled feeding paradigm (6-hour feeding/18-hour fasting) significantly enhanced circadian rhythmicity, consolidated sleep, and improved social deficits and repetitive behaviors in the Fmr1 KO mice.

While eleven compounds (aldosterone, arecoline, bortezomib, dasatinib, decitabine, dexamethasone, erlotinib, everolimus, gefitinib, temsirolimus, and thalidomide) either had no effect on median lifespan or were toxic, five compounds (all-trans retinoic acid, berberine, fisetin, propranolol, and ritonavir) extended lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. These computer predictions yield a remarkable positive hit rate of 30%. Deeper genetic characterization of the longevity effects of one of the most efficacious compounds, the endogenous signaling ligand all-trans retinoic acid (atRA, designated tretinoin in medical products), which is widely prescribed for treatment of acne, skin photoaging and acute promyelocytic leukemia, demonstrated a requirement for the regulatory kinases AKT-1 and AKT-2. While the canonical Akt-target FOXO/DAF-16 was largely dispensable, other conserved Akt-targets (Nrf2/SKN-1 and HSF1/HSF-1), as well as the conserved catalytic subunit of AMPK AAK-2, were all necessary for longevity extension by atRA. Evolutionary conservation of retinoic acid as a signaling ligand and the structure of the downstream effector network of retinoic acid combine to suggest that the all-trans retinoic acid pathway is an ancient metabolic regulatory system that can modulate lifespan. Our results highlight the potential of combining computational prediction of longevity interventions with the power of nematode functional genetics and underscore that the manipulation of a conserved metabolic regulatory circuit by co-opting endogenous signaling molecules is a powerful approach for discovering aging interventions.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

K.; Klingler, A.; Gaier, L.; Schaumberger, A.; Clark, A. T.", "abstract": "Grasslands face an uncertain future due to climate change. Although there is increased interest in the interdependencies of different biodiversity components, the effects of climate change on these relationships remain understudied. One of these is the richness-evenness relationship (RER), which is sensitive to altered species abundances in relation to richness. This relationship may be important as evenness and richness jointly shape diverse ecosystem functions, such as stability and productivity. As evenness affects productivity differently in low and high richness communities, the richness-evenness relationship is important to investigate, especially under climate change. Here, we assess the effects of increased CO2 concentrations, temperature, and drought on the RER in a subalpine long-term (2010 - ongoing) grassland climate change experiment, and test whether these effects can be buffered by reseeding. We provide evidence that climate change alters the RER in our experiment, and that these changes occur independently of changes in richness and evenness separately. Reseeding erases the differences in RER between treatments and controls but fails to restore the negative RER initially found in controls. Further, we show that the dominant grass species in our system (Arrhenatherum elatius) responds differently to each climate change factor, with opposite effects in high vs. low richness plots, thereby largely determining the direction of the RER. These results suggest that the RER can reveal additional insights on community responses to climate change and represents a different signal than evenness or richness alone. A more nuanced approach integrating evenness and maximizing richness in seed mixtures could be an important step forward to better match restoration treatments to particular community types and global change drivers.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, eye movements are emerging as significant indicators of psychopathologies and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, dementia, depression, and tinnitus. Despite its crucial importance across domains, the role of oculomotion has been underexplored in neuroimaging studies - largely due to methodological challenges. These challenges often involve treating eye movements as artefacts to be removed from the neural signal. While useful for data cleaning, this approach risks discarding valuable information about oculomotor control. An alternative is to directly model these signals. Using recently established time-resolved regression methods, we apply and extend this approach to present a unified framework we term \"Ocular Response Functions\"(ORFs). Using simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking during the resting-state, we derive ORFs that characterise the neural signatures of distinct oculomotor events, specifically saccades, blinks, and pupil dilation. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to model the relationship between ocular action and neural activity (encoding) and, conversely, to reconstruct ocular events from brain activity. We further validate this approach by applying resting-state derived ORFs to a passive listening task, showing they can reveal oculomotor contributions to task-related neural processing. By providing an accessible framework for examining the interplay between eye movements and neural processes, we offer a powerful tool for research that has potential applications in clinical neuroscience.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Our previous study reported that shoot nitrate accumulation increases shoot expression of adenylate ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE 3 (IPT3) and shoot levels of N6-({Delta}2-isopentenyl) adenine (iP)-type cytokinins (CKs). IPT3 expression is localized in the phloem, and iP-type CKs, which are synthesized by IPT3, are phloem-mobile. As CKs are a class of phytohormones that control growth and genome-wide gene expression, shoot-expressed IPT3 may mediate the systemic regulation of growth and transcriptomic responses to shoot nitrate status. To examine this, we developed a novel system to manipulate nitrate levels and IPT3 expression in a shoot-specific manner and performed growth analysis, CK determination, and RNA-sequencing. Our results demonstrated that shoot nitrate accumulation significantly promoted shoot growth and elevated shoot concentrations of iP ribotides, iP-7-N-glucoside, and iP-9-N-glucoside through the action of shoot IPT3. Transcriptomic responses to shoot nitrate accumulation were largely tuned by shoot IPT3, with opposite effects in shoots and roots. Shoot IPT3 amplified shoot responses of nitrate-inducible genes and immune response genes to shoot nitrate accumulation, while dampened root responses of nitrate transport/assimilation genes. This transcriptomic modulation via shoot IPT3 was accompanied by coherent transcriptional changes in genes encoding mobile peptides and transcriptional repressors.

As a result, selection coefficients may be better modeled as distributions that differ across populations, time, environments, and individuals rather than single values. Further, the number of genes contributing to a trait and epistasis between alleles enhance negative selection due to the increased variance pushing more individuals to phenotypic extremes.

However, whether the PIEZO gene responds to magnetic fields and the mechanisms underlying its regulation of root growth remain unclear.

Mutation of PIEZO led to a significantly shorter roots under MF exposure and blue light illumination. We further identified that PIEZO expression in root tips was up-regulated by a blue light-induced signal, which is transmitted from leaves to roots in the presence of a MF. PIEZO modulated calcium ion efflux and disturbed auxin transport, specifically through interactions with PIN-FORMED (PIN) 3, 6 and 7 under combined MF and blue light conditions. Notably, the blue light receptors CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1) and CRY2 were essential for both MF perception and the regulation of root growth. Transcriptome analysis of the piezo-cl mutant under MF and blue light revealed that the PIEZO integrates multiple signaling pathways, including those involved in gibberellin 4 (GA4), ethylene, calcium ion-related genes, mechanosensors, and microRNAs. Specifically, miR5648-5p expression conferred MF sensitivity and provided a mechanism for the negative regulation of PIEZO under these conditions.

Of particular relevance are DA projections stemming from the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA). A key neuromodulatory influence onto DAVTA neurons arises from lateral hypothalamic area hypocretin/orexin (OX) neurons. Despite being a major input, the differential action of orexin peptides A and B (OXA and OXB) on orexin receptors 1 and 2 in DA cells is poorly understood. We recently identified profoundly divergent functions of OX1R vs OX2R in DA cells in regulating sleep/wake architecture, brain oscillations and cognitive behaviors. OX2R, but not OX1R, loss dramatically increased time in EEG theta-rich (alert) wakefulness, reward-driven learning and attentional skills, but impaired inhibitory control. METHODS: Using genetically engineered mice whose DA cells selectively lack OX input via Hcrtr1 (DAOx1R-KO) or Hcrtr2 (DAOx2R-KO), we assessed intrinsic excitability and electrophysiological responses of DAVTA neurons and evaluated behavioral phenotypes across multiple domains. RESULTS: We uncover previously unrecognized effects of OX peptides on DAVTA cell response. In WT and control mice, we show that while OXA enhances, OXB diminishes DAVTA neuronal excitability. OX1R-deficient DA cells lose OXA responding and OX2R-deficient DA cells lose OXB responding. DA Ox1R loss generates anxiety-like behavior and context-dependent hyperactivity. In contrast, OX2R loss decreases sociability and, despite exhibiting enhanced reward-driven learning, mice show highly compromised aversion-driven learning. CONCLUSIONS: We evidence strikingly distinct functions of OX1R vs OX2R signaling in modulating the intrinsic excitability of DAVTA neurons and influencing DA-related behaviors. These data implicate OX[-&gt;]DA signaling pathways in neuropsychiatric endophenotypes relevant to obsessive-compulsive, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorders, and raise important considerations for the development of OXR-targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Yet, the relationship among these roles is unknown. Here, we show DA's tripartite functions are causally linked by a process in which phasic striatal DA rapidly and persistently recalibrates the propensity to move, a measure of vigor. Using a self-timed movement task, we found that single exposures to reward-related DA transients (both endogenous and exogenously-induced) exerted one-shot updates to movement timing--but in a surprising fashion. Rather than reinforce specific movement times, DA transients quantitatively changed movement timing on the next trial, with larger transients leading to earlier movements (and smaller to later), consistent with a stochastic search process that calibrates the frequency of movement. Both abrupt and gradual changes in external and internal contingencies--such as timing criterion, reward content, and satiety state--caused changes to the amplitude of DA transients that causally altered movement timing. The rapidity and bidirectionality of the one-shot effects are difficult to reconcile with gradual synaptic plasticity, and instead point to more flexible cellular mechanisms, such as DA-dependent modulation of neuronal excitability.

Using human iPSC-derived CNCCs, we identified ~550 hominoid-specific TEs functioning as enhancers, including ~250 human-specific, predominantly LTR5Hs. These elements are enriched for CNCC coordinator motifs, are bound by the CNCC signature factor TWIST1, and their enhancer activity appears largely CNCC-specific. CRISPR-interference targeting ~75% of these active TEs led to widespread transcriptional dysregulation of genes involved in neural crest migration, and two orthogonal functional assays confirmed that CNCC migration is impaired upon TE repression. Finally, genes near human-specific TEs showed higher expression in human CNCCs compared to chimpanzee CNCCs, but TE repression restored gene expression to chimpanzee levels.

Computational predictions from molecular simulation have offered conflicting results, some showing long-range E-induced membrane curvature and others showing only local deformations. In the present study, we determine the mechanism driving these deformations by modulating the degree of hydrophobic mismatch between protein and membrane. We observe that certain barostat and restraint settings, common in coarse-grained MD simulations, can prevent equilibration of the membrane area. Our results indicate that the E protein does not induce long-range curvature, but does exhibit severe local deformations that are exacerbated by hydrophobic mismatch. These deformations occur in conjunction with local leaflet thickness asymmetry, suggesting asymmetry and curvature couple to reduce the free energy cost of a deformed membrane.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a robust cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) platform that uses the PhoX cross-linker to map proteome-wide interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana under semi-native conditions. Using whole-cell lysates, chloroplasts, and nuclei, we identified 47,119 unique cross-links, including 3,527 inter-protein cross-links. We then constructed a high-confidence protein-protein interaction (PPI) network containing 1,229 proteins and 1,446 PPIs. In silico validation using STRING confirmed 637 heteromeric interactions with a combined confidence score of at least 0.4, including 532 interactions with a score of at least 0.7. The remaining interactions are novel. Our dataset provides direct experimental evidence of physical interactions and defines residue-level binding interfaces. XL-MS resolved the spatial topology of structurally challenging protein complexes, such as the chloroplast 70S ribosome stalks, and transient intermediates involved in photosystem repair. XL-MS also revealed both conserved and distinct interaction patterns across photosystem complexes, ribosomes, and chromatin-associated proteins. Notably, the data suggest that the ribosome undergoes ubiquitination and is regulated by the 26S proteasome. This finding is further supported by in vivo diGly proteomic analysis. Among the novel interactions uncovered is a metabolite enzyme that interacts with histones, which could potentially contribute to histone modification. This work establishes XL-MS as a powerful tool for advancing the functional annotation of genomes and the understanding of the architecture of protein complexes and cellular regulation in plants, providing a valuable resource for the plant research community.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

However, in in vivo experiments, its water insolubility becomes a significant obstacle. This study describes a promising method for the administration of betulin in in vivo experiments and the determination of betulin levels in organ samples. Methods: Betulin is dissolved first in ethanol, and this solution is introduced into acylglycerols, followed by evaporation of the ethanol. Olive oil and food-grade lard were determined to be suitable lipids for noninvasive application per os. A method for processing the organs of experimental animals for betulin determination was developed. Determination in blood is also likely the only viable option to be used in future clinical studies and practice. Results: The maximum amount of betulin usable (i.e., absorbable by organisms) in olive oil (10 mg/ml), suppository mass (6 mg/ml), food lard (4 mg/ml), and cocoa butter (2 mg/ml) carriers was found microscopically. A specific distribution of betulin concentration in the organs of experimental animals (Wistar rats) after a weekly diet containing betulin was discovered. The blood was shown to be particularly advantageous, as it allows continuous monitoring of betulin levels in the body. In these pilot experiments, a statistically significant (P < 0.001) synergistic effect of betulin on solid Ehrlich adenocarcinoma tumors was observed when betulin was combined with cytostatic Namitecan (NMRI mice). The high-purity betulin used in this study is very stable even under fluctuating storage conditions. Conclusions: Our study proves that both the method of betulin administration and the proposed analytical procedure could greatly increase the reliability and reproducibility of in vivo studies and future preclinical and clinical studies on the effects of betulin and possibly other similar water-insoluble triterpenoids on living organisms.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

In this article, a novel approach has been used to design and print nanoporous microelectrodes on culture wells enabling in situ recording of electrophysiological neural activities. Optimized ink formulations are developed for conductive nanocarbon microelectrodes, and furthermore, fluoropolymer (polytetrafluoroethylene-based AF2400) ink has been inkjet printed for the first time acting as an insulator layer for microelectrodes. To keep the biocompatible nanoporous structure of culture wells, the microelectrodes have been printed on the bottom of the culture cells and only small connector pads have been produced on top of the culture membrane. Neural activity has been recorded by such a microelectrode structure for rodent brain slices cultured for three weeks.

Using primary cardiac fibroblasts and in vivo mouse models, we show that Lmna mutations impact various aspects of cardiac fibroblast function in response to myocyte damage. We show that both lamin A/C depletion and point-mutant variant expression impair cardiac fibroblast proliferation and contraction whereas other functions such as cell migration appears to be mutation dependent. In vivo depletion of lamin A/C simultaneously in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts significantly delayed disease progression, improved cardiac function, and prolonged survival, indicating that lamin A/C mediate an opposing balance between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts in driving disease pathogenesis.

This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive attention by examining beta-band power suppression during heartbeat and auditory discrimination tasks. Fifty-one healthy participants engaged in interoceptive (heartbeat detection) and exteroceptive (auditory discrimination) tasks while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results revealed significant beta suppression time-locked to the R-peak in the somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, mid-cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 310 to 530 ms post-R-peak. Beta suppression was more pronounced during interoceptive attention, correlating positively with interoceptive accuracy. The findings support the notion that beta suppression in fronto-cingulo-somatosensory network may serve as a neural marker of interoceptive processing, contributing to predictive coding models of interoception. This study highlights the potential for using beta suppression as an objective measure of interoceptive accuracy and suggests that neural oscillations play a critical role in the brain's regulation of heartbeat-related information. Furthermore, the study proposes that interoceptive attention involves a top-down mechanism that dynamically adjusts the brain's response to cardiac afferent signals, enhancing the precision of interoceptive processing. These findings have implications for understanding how the brain integrates interoceptive signals and may provide insights into clinical applications targeting interoceptive dysfunctions.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

R.; LU, T.", "abstract": "The presentation of antigens by Human Leukocyte Antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules is a cornerstone of adaptive immunity. Although existing prediction tools such as NetMHCpan and MHCflurry exhibit high accuracy in predicting binding affinity between peptides and specific HLA-I alleles, they are constrained to a preset set of alleles. Consequently, they can neither directly determine whether a peptide is an epitope nor provide a holistic binding profile across the entire HLA-I allelic landscape. To overcome these challenges, we introduce two synergistic models: PHbinder (Peptide-HLA-I Binder) and PSGM (Pseudo Sequence Generation and Mapping). PHbinder integrates features from a fine-tuned ESM2 language model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), processing them through parallel CNN and Transformer branches to capture local and global patterns, which are then fused using a Cross-Multi-Head Attention mechanism. In the epitope prediction task, PHbinder achieved an accuracy of prediction of 85. 12%, significantly exceeding established benchmark models. Complementing this, the PSGM model employs a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) architecture to generate the corresponding HLA-I pseudo-sequences. These are then mapped to the known alleles using a Hamming distance-based nearest-neighbor search. PSGM achieved 49.26% average coverage in its predictions of the Top-50 alleles. Furthermore, orthogonal validation with MHCflurry revealed that 63% of the highest affinity binding partners within its Top-50 list were new experimentally unverified HLA-I alleles. Together, PHbinder and PSGM establish a cascaded framework that enables a precise \"Peptide [-&gt;] Epitope Determination [-&gt;] HLA-I Alleles List\" pipeline.

Using 12 site-specific antibodies, the method is capable of measuring 2^12 (4,096) potential proteoform groups. We used IMaP to measure proteoform group profiles of the tau protein, a key player in neurodegenerative diseases, using two pan anti-tau antibodies (Tau-13, Tau-216), three isoform-specific antibodies (Anti-0N, Anti-2N, Anti-4R), and seven phosphosite-specific antibodies (Anti-pT181, Anti-pS202+pT205, Anti-pT205, Anti-pS214, Anti-pT217, Anti-pT231, and Anti-pS396). The method demonstrates high sensitivity (detecting proteoforms at 0.1% abundance), high reproducibility (median CV <5.5%), and broad dynamic range (>3 orders of magnitude), outperforming conventional techniques in resolving closely related proteoform groups. We demonstrated that the method can be used on relevant biological samples by examining various neuronal models (iNeuron cells, organoids, MiBrains, and mouse brains) and human samples. This examination revealed 130 distinct tau proteoform groups with as many as six phosphorylation events. The non-random distribution of these phosphorylation events suggests ordered and site-specific modification processes rather than random, stochastic accumulation. Certain combinations of phosphorylation events were more abundant than others; for example, pT217 preferentially co-occurred with pT181. In validating the applicability of the assay to human disease samples, we noted a specific pattern of multiple phosphorylation events in an advanced Alzheimer's disease patient that suggests a sequential pathway of pathological tau modification.

Although the RXLR-EER motif in these effectors is critical for host translocation and is cleaved prior to secretion, the relevance of this processing is poorly understood. Prior evidence suggests RXLR effectors utilize a distinct, unconventional secretion pathway, raising the question of whether the RXLR-EER motif influences selection of the secretion route. Here, we combined genetic, molecular and cell biology approaches to investigate the secretion pathway of RXLR effectors. Confocal microscopy revealed that RXLR and apoplastic effectors localize to distinct vesicular compartments in cultured hyphae. Moreover, fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to RXLR effectors did not impair their secretion, in contrast to apoplastic effectors, which were retained in the endomembrane system, indicating that RXLR effectors bypass the canonical ER-to-Golgi pathway. Importantly, RXLR effectors associate with extracellular vesicles (EVs), whereas RXLR-EER motif mutants show reduced EV association and are rerouted through the ER-to-Golgi secretion pathway. These findings demonstrate that the RXLR-EER motif governs effector sorting into an unconventional, EV-linked secretion route.

Their historical significance, linked to the rise of the Anglo-Norman era (1093-1286 CE) in Scotland, and the historical complexities of surname adoption post-Norman conquest of England, justifies the need for a comprehensive understanding of the genetic history of the Hay noble lineage. This study focuses on examining the patterns of paternal inheritance in lineages with the Hay surname. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Y-chromosome data that is publicly available on the Family Tree DNA (FTDNA) platform, and specific FTDNA surname projects, as well as looking in more detail at three well-documented male-line descendants of William II HAY, 1st Earl of Erroll, (d. 1201) that have been verified to a high degree of confidence. Our results reveal that all descendants of William II HAY, 1st Earl of Erroll, (d. 1201) derive from the multigenerational Y-SNPs R1a - YP6500 (plus equivalent SNPs BY33394 / FT2017) and R1a - FTT161. Furthermore, subclades of R1a - FTT161 have been identified that confirm direct male-line descent from two of William II HAYs sons. Subclade R1a - BY199342 (plus equivalents) confirms direct male-line descent from David HAY, 2nd Earl of Erroll, (d. 1241), and subclade R1a - FTA7312 confirms direct male line decent from Robert HAY of Erroll. The result also confirms that the Hay noble lineage shares the Y-SNP R1a - YP4138 (estimated to have occurred 832 CE) with several non-Hay testers that have surnames of Norman origin, therefore, providing further evidence to support the Norman origin hypothesis for these surnames. In addition to the identification of multigenerational Y-SNPs associated to documented Hay noblemen, this study has observed significant Y-DNA haplogroup diversity among males with the surname Hay (plus associated spelling variants: Hays, Haye, Hayes, Hey and Haya). Our results show that only 22% of the men sampled (n=109) with the surname Hay (plus associated spelling variation) are descended from the 12th century progenitor of the noble Hay lineage of Scotland.

Despite extensive research on biodiversity responses to anthropogenic stressors, phylum-specific resistance and resilience dynamics - particularly in coastal marine ecosystems - remain poorly understood. Considering the global scale of coastal development, it is imperative to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how biodiversity, in terms of richness and community composition, is influenced by various anthropogenic stressors. Here, we present the first application of standardized Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) as an experimental unit - using a common garden experimental design - to examine community responses to stress within an urbanized seascape. ARMS were seeded within two marine reserves for one year and then transplanted to sites of stress, including domestic sewage, and mariculture. We hypothesized that 1) human impacts reduce richness and alter composition of established communities; and 2) increasing intensity of these impacts reduces community resistance and resilience to stress. Using metabarcoding, we quantified richness and taxonomic composition and assessed their changes along an impact gradient. Our results showed that nutrient pollution, particularly inorganic nitrogen, significantly reduced species richness and restructured communities.

Such analyses have provided clarity where traditional morphological analyses may not have, and have been instrumental in a range of evolutionary, systematic, and taxonomic studies for providing clarity to evolutionary relationships.

Although this medically important genus of insects has received significant study, the majority of research has focused on those relatively few species that are invasive and transmit disease. As a result, the classification of the genus has been contentious, with numerous taxonomic changes over the last two decades being undertaken and reversed based entirely on analyses of somewhat limited morphological data.

Recent studies demonstrate that the olfactory bulb (OB) encodes such temporal features present in natural odor stimuli. However, whether this temporal information is encoded in the piriform cortex (PCx), the primary cortical target of OB projections, remains unknown. Here, we developed a biophysically relevant PCx network model and simulated it using previously recorded in vivo activities of mitral and tufted cells from OB in response to 2Hz and 20Hz odor frequencies for three odor mixtures. Analysis of the pyramidal cells (PYRs) activity during the initial 500ms of odor stimulation revealed that 4.4-11.8% of cells exhibited significantly different average firing rates for the two different frequencies. Furthermore, 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) models trained and tested on PYRs activities achieved discrimination accuracies of 73-95%. However, cells showing significant frequency discrimination contributed similarly to CNN performance as the non-discriminating cells. Using virtual synaptic knockout models, we found that eliminating either feedback or feedforward inhibition onto PYRs improved CNN decoding accuracy across all odor conditions. Conversely, eliminating recurrent excitation among pyramidal neurons or eliminating recurrent inhibition among both interneuron types simultaneously degraded CNN accuracy. Removing recurrent connections within individual interneuron populations had minimal effects on the performance. Our PCx model demonstrates that it can discriminate between 2Hz and 20Hz odor stimuli, with a bidirectional capability of performance modulation by specific circuit motifs. These findings predict that the piriform cortex encodes and processes temporal features of odor stimuli.\n\nSignificance StatementTemporal dynamics of odor concentration in odor plumes carry crucial spatial information for olfactory-guided animals. Here, we simulated a biophysically relevant network model of the piriform cortex to show that the network differentially encodes odor frequencies at 2Hz and 20Hz. Using 1D convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that the odor frequency response decoding was well above chance level and broadly distributed among piriform cortex output neurons. Furthermore, we show that various circuit motifs within the network impact its frequency encoding capacity, an effect that could not be replicated by merely altering the baseline activity of pyramidal cells. Overall, our results predict that the piriform cortex network can discriminate odor frequencies, which can be modulated bidirectionally by specific network attributes.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

The functional profiling workflow uniquely combines the speed of PyHMMER for feature annotation, the accuracy of Salmon for read quantification against genome-resolved reference gene catalogs, and graph-based pathway completeness assessment. I demonstrate Leviathan's capabilities using the CAMI low, medium, and high complexity datasets. Compared to the widely used tool HUMAnN, Leviathan exhibits significantly reduced runtimes (up to ~72-fold faster) and memory usage (up to ~14-fold lower), while achieving competitive or superior accuracy gains (up to 12%) in identifying functional features at both individual genome and pangenome levels.

In fields with multiple plant species, disease management can become challenging, as different crops can either reduce or increase virus transmission. Motivated by empirical evidence that intercropping can limit virus spread, we develop a mathematical model that integrates the epidemiological dynamics of multiple crops and an insect vector. We derive an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, showing how infectivity rates and crop composition together determine whether a disease will persist or die out. We also derive a threshold index to assess the potential for transient outbreaks, even when long-term disease persistence is unlikely. We compare monocultures with intercropped systems and find that intercropping does not always reduce disease risk, where, under some conditions, it can actually enhance virus spread. Finally, we explore how crop diversity may shape the evolution of vector host preferences, potentially altering long-term disease risks. These results have practical implications for designing intercropping systems that minimise virus transmission while avoiding unintended amplification effects, providing a theoretical foundation for sustainable and effective plant disease control.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

T.; Kannan, K.", "abstract": "Background: Isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type (IDH wild-type) gliomas represents the most aggressive subtype of diffuse gliomas, characterized by therapeutic resistance and dismal prognosis. Despite advances in molecular classification, reliable prognostic biomarkers for these tumors remain limited, particularly for recurrent disease. This study aims to identify gene expression signatures associated with survival outcomes in recurrent IDH wild-type gliomas, with the goal of improving patient stratification and potential therapeutic targeting. Methods: We analyzed gene expression data from 180 recurrent IDH wild-type glioma samples from the Glioma Longitudinal AnalySiS (GLASS) Consortium. Using multiple computational approaches including a novel network-based method (netSurvival) and various survival analysis techniques, we identified genes associated with patient survival outcomes. Results: Our comprehensive analysis identify several gene expression markers that are significantly associated with survival outcomes in recurrent IDH wild-type gliomas. The AFT log normal model revealed that FN1, HIF3A, and EIF4B are associated with poorer survival (hazard ratios of 1.40, 1.49, and 1.54, respectively; p < 0.05), while PTK2, CCND2, RAD51L3 RFFL, and MAX demonstrated protective effects (hazard ratios of 0.76, 0.78, 0.79, and 0.79, respectively; p < 0.05). Five genes (KIF5C, LINC00632, B4GALNT3, HIF3A, and RAD51L3 RFFL) show significant differential expression between primary and recurrent tumors, with four having established functional roles in glioma pathobiology. Conclusions: This study identifies a panel of gene expression markers with significant prognostic value in recurrent IDH wild-type gliomas. The differential impacts of these genes on survival outcomes provide insights into the biological heterogeneity underlying clinical behavior in these aggressive tumors. Particularly significant are the biomarkers associated with both survival outcomes and recurrence patterns, which may represent key drivers of disease progression.

K.; Prusty, D.; Islam, S. R.; Sengupta, K.", "abstract": "Lamins are critical for maintaining nuclear homeostasis, chromosome positioning, and cellular mechanotransduction, which involves the transfer of mechanical signals from the cellular microenvironment to the nucleus. Recent studies have also highlighted the involvement of lamin A in mitochondrial homeostasis and the regulation of reactive oxygen species production. Missense mutations in lamin A are linked to a spectrum of diseases known as laminopathies, which include conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), muscular dystrophy, and progeria. One such mutation, K97E, is associated with DCM, causing severe cardiac complications that can lead to myocardial infarction in extreme cases. Our study reveals a detailed pathogenic cascade in K97E-transfected cells involving disrupted interaction with Prohibitin-2, a key mitochondrial protein. Mitochondria exhibit increased fission, reduced fusion, and fragmentation, due to OPA1 downregulation and DRP1 recruitment driven by actin cytoskeletal remodelling. Impaired Rho-ERK- FAK signalling reduces F-actin assembly, elevating G-actin, which further promotes mitochondrial fission. This feedback loop leads to mitochondrial depolarisation, ATP deficiency, and global metabolic catastrophe, in particular cholesterol metabolism, accompanied by elevated ROS. In cardiomyocytes, such dysfunction may underlie contractile deficits and arrhythmias. Our findings establish PHB2 as a critical node linking nuclear integrity, cytoskeletal architecture, and mitochondrial homeostasis, offering new insights into DCM pathogenesis and therapeutic targets.

The dynamic behavior of endogenous HSCs in their niches has been challenging to study due to the complexity of markers required to define pure HSCs. Multiple recently developed reporter strategies advanced our capacity to identify HSCs in situ. Yet, they provide different levels of HSC enrichment and are frequently not stable in situations of perturbed hematopoiesis, leading to contradictory observations of HSC migratory behavior. Here we employed a new double reporter strategy by combining the Hoxb5-mKO2 and Vwf-GFP reporters, that are stably expressed in homeostasis, stress and ageing. Hoxb5+Vwf+ cells represent a subset of highly pure and potent long-term HSCs with a platelet-biased pattern of differentiation, that are included in the populations identified by other reporter strategies. Intravital microscopy revealed Hoxb5+Vwf+ cells to be non-migratory in homeostasis, following platelet depletion when these cells are actively proliferating, and during ageing. This non-migratory behavior of HSCs in homeostasis and stress indicates that their activation does not inherently depend on relocation to alternative niches eliciting proliferation, as previously proposed. We found Hoxb5+Vwf+ HSCs in direct contact with vasculature and LepR+ perivascular cells but not preferentially closer to megakaryocytes. Nevertheless, increased megakaryopoiesis following platelet depletion brings megakaryocytes into close proximity of Hoxb5+Vwf+ HSCs, revealing previously unrecognized niche dynamics in HSC regulation during regeneration.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

D.; Senf, V.; Margulies, K. B.", "abstract": "Background: Mechanical memory (MM) describes the persistent phenotypic remodeling following exposure to a transient extrinsic biomechanical cue. Short-term biomechanical stress is a feature of several etiologies of cardiomyopathy, including dysfunction of the viable myocardium following a large myocardial infarction. However, the nuclear mechanisms linking stiffness to persistent cellular remodeling remain poorly understood. Methods: We cultured human iPSC-cardiomyocytes on a magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) with tunable stiffness (9-56 kPa) to mimic physiological and pathological myocardium. This allowed us to assess how transient increases in stiffness influence cellular responses such as nuclear structure, and DNA damage in hiPSC-cardiomyocytes. Using a combination of Immunofluorescence imaging, Western Blot and pharmacological interventions, we examined the role of microtubule detyrosination and the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex in transducing mechanical signals from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus with a focus on MM induction. Results: Short-term (6 h) stiff priming induced reversible phenotypic changes upon resoftening. However, 48 h of stiff priming triggered persistent MM, characterized by nuclear rupture, increased lamin A/C expression, DNA damage, and cytoplasmic leakage of DNA repair factors like KU80. Disruption of either a-tubulin detyrosination or the LINC complex prevented MM and nuclear damage, indicating that these elements are essential for nuclear mechanotransduction. In contrast, depletion of lamin A/C or DNA repair components accelerated stiffness-induced phenotypes and promoted MM onset within 6 hours. Finally, inhibition of a-tubulin detyrosination using ADV-TTL reversed both MM and DNA damage. Conclusions: Acceleration of MM induction by lamin knockdown suggests that hereditary laminopathies may be associated with increased cardiomyocyte vulnerability to transient mechanical stress inducing DNA damage and senescence. Conversely, the protective effects of limiting stiffness-induced -tubulin detyrosination, or nuclear mechano-transduction suggest potential cardioprotective strategies in the setting of laminopathies and/or sustained increases in extracellular matrix stiffness.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Chromosomes in G1-phase PCC closely resemble metaphase chromatids in the light microscope, and measurements using FLIM-FRET show that they have the same level of chromatin compaction as metaphase chromosomes. However, histone H1 is not phosphorylated in G1- or early S-phase PCC. These results suggest that H1 phosphorylation is not required for mitotic chromosome condensation and chromatin compaction. They also confirm that Cdk1/cyclin B, which directly phosphorylates histone H1, is not active in G1 and thus is not essential for G1-PCC. We suggest that induction of G1-PCC involves protein kinases or other factors that are either held in an inactive state by protein phosphatases, or constitutively active but countered by phosphatases. The same factors may be involved in the onset of normal mitosis, becoming active when protein phosphatases are downregulated. Induction of PCC with calyculin A should provide a useful system for identifying and studying the biochemical pathways that are required for mitotic chromosome compaction, nuclear envelope breakdown, and other events of mitosis.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

MTARC1 p.A165T variant is associated with reduced risk of MASLD. We previously showed that this variant promotes MTARC1 protein degradation, suggesting MTARC1 inactivation may represent a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we report that global or liver specific Mtarc1 knockout markedly suppresses diet-induced hepatic TG accumulation, liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis in a manner dependently on lipolysis and lipophagy. MTARC1 inactivation post-transcriptionally upregulates PEMT and CEPT1 expression, consequently elevating GPL levels, including PC, PE, and lyso-PE, three major GPLs of hepatic LDs. Furthermore, we observed that MTARC1-deficient hepatocytes exhibited smaller but more numerous LDs compared to controls, under comparable cellular TG levels during lipolysis/lipophagy inhibition. Importantly, inhibition of CEPT1 or PEMT could attenuated the hepatoprotective effect of MTARC1 deficiency. Mechanistically, subcellular GPL remodeling induced by MTARC1 deficiency reduce LD size while increase their surface-to-volume ratio, which in turn promote TG degradation through lipolysis and lipophagy. Collectively, our findings identify MTARC1-GPL biosynthesis-LD degradation axis as a key regulator of fatty liver disease and highlight MTARC1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for MASLD.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Here we demonstrate that the main nuclear pore basket component, Translocated Promoter Region (TPR), forms biomolecular condensates which are necessary and sufficient to exclude heterochromatin. We further demonstrate that this mechanism controls chromatin organization locally, at nuclear pores, and regulates heterochromatin positioning in the entire nucleus.

To overcome this problem, we engineered a light-activatable version of IRE1 and probed the transcriptomic effects of IRE1 activity in isolation from the other branches of the UPR. We demonstrate that 1) oligomerization alone is sufficient to activate IRE1 in human cells, 2) the IRE1 transcriptional response evolves substantially under prolonged activation, and 3) the UPR induces major changes in mRNA splice isoform abundance in an IRE1-independent manner.

Recently, RNA ribosylation was also found in mammalian cells under conditions of cell stress, though the functional consequences remain unclear. Here we find that infection with chikungunya virus, a positive strand RNA virus that causes frequent widespread epidemics, increases overall levels of RNA ribosylation in human fibroblasts. During infection, viral RNA is ribosylated by the PARP12 ribosyltransferase, which is counteracted by a virally-encoded. Increased viral RNA ribosylation resulted in decreased translation in cell-free systems and infected fibroblasts, and more rapid viral RNA decay. Further, ribosylated RNA potently induced the expression of antiviral host response genes. Together these data show the first functional consequences of RNA ribosylation in mammalian cells by showing that RNA ribosylation inhibits translation, decreases RNA stability, and creates a novel pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that activates the host innate immune response. As macrodomains are present in multiple unrelated viruses, our data suggest RNA ribosylation is a novel component of cellular antiviral sensing pathway.

As part of this process, thermogenesis, fueled by uncoupled mitochondrial respiration, plays a central role in converting calories into thermal energy, thereby preventing their storage as fat. Here, we identify a role for exosome trafficking as an intrinsic regulator of beige adipocyte thermogenesis. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that mediate cell-cell and intracellular communication by transporting regulatory cargo, including microRNAs, proteins, and lipids. Using both human cells and mouse models, we show that thermogenic activation of beige adipocytes promotes the rapid release of exosomes enriched in microRNAs known to suppress thermogenic programs. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of exosome secretion attenuates thermogenesis, whereas enhancing exosome release amplifies thermogenic output. Mice deficient in the exosome secretion regulator Rab27a exhibit reduced energy expenditure in response to both cold exposure and {beta}3-adrenergic stimulation. These findings establish exosome trafficking as a key contributor to beige adipocyte thermogenic capacity, highlighting an intracellular mechanism that may be leveraged to enhance energy expenditure and treat obesity-related metabolic diseases.\n\nSignificance statementThermogenic adipocytes, including beige fat cells, help maintain energy balance by converting excess nutrients into heat, thereby reducing fat storage and supporting metabolic function. Although these cells are known to promote energy expenditure, the intracellular processes that enable their full thermogenic response are not well defined. Here, we show that exosome secretion is required for beige adipocytes to reach their full thermogenic potential. Blocking exosome release dampens this response, while boosting it amplifies thermogenic output. These findings point to exosome release as an essential part of thermogenic regulation and a potential target for improving metabolic health.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

While the response of SC-islets to chronic hypoxia has been studied, a direct comparison to primary human islets during the acute hypoxic phase has not been performed. Here, we conduct a comparative single-cell transcriptomic and functional analysis of human SC-islets and primary islets exposed to acute hypoxia (1% O2) over 48 hours.\n\nResultsOur analysis reveals two divergent response patterns. Primary islets exhibit an energy-conserving response, characterized by a {beta}-cell-specific suppression of identity genes (PDX1, MAFA) and pro-apoptotic factors like DDIT3, alongside a shift toward metabolic quiescence. In contrast, the SC-islet response is characterized by lineage instability, a significant metabolic shift toward glycolysis, and the activation of pro-apoptotic pathways. Functionally, these transcriptomic differences result in a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in both islet types, but through different mechanisms: a suppression of secretion in primary islets versus dysregulated, glucose-unresponsive insulin release in SC-islets.\n\nConclusionThese findings demonstrate that SC-islets are particularly vulnerable under hypoxic stress, exhibiting an unstable, plastic phenotype.

To achieve these diverse functions, dynein-dynactin associates with different activating adaptors. Nuclear Mitotic Apparatus (NuMA) is a mitosis-specific adaptor that connects dynein-dynactin with microtubules to focus mitotic spindle poles. NuMA's C-terminal microtubule-binding activity is promoted by mitotic phosphorylation, but regulation of NuMA's N-terminal interaction with dynein-dynactin remains unclear. Here, we combine a membrane-tethering assay, quantitative proteomics, and live functional analyses in human cells to show that the interaction between NuMA's N-terminus and dynein-dynactin is cell cycle-regulated and driven by mitotic phosphorylation. We identify highly conserved CDK1 consensus sites proximal to NuMA's dynein heavy chain-binding site, which are phosphorylated by CDK1-Cyclin B1 in cells and in vitro. This CDK1-dependent phosphorylation, together with NuMA's Spindly-like motif, is crucial for stable dynein-dynactin-NuMA (DDN) complex formation. Replacement of endogenous NuMA with phosphorylation-deficient NuMA mutants leads to aberrant dynein distribution on mitotic spindles, resulting in chromosome mis-segregation and micronucleus formation.

Like Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses, it is one of the arboviruses that poses an emerging threat to areas where its main vectors, Aedes mosquitoes, proliferate, well beyond tropical and subtropical regions. Although often asymptomatic or mild, ZIKV infection has been responsible for a worrying increase in serious congenital syndromes, including microcephaly. The ability of ZIKV to be transmitted sexually and its long persistence in body fluids suggests its incomplete clearance in particular tissues, linked to recurrent infection. Among its clinical presentations, ZIKV infection has been associated with ocular complications, including maculopathy, retinopathy, uveitis, and optic neuropathy, which can lead to lasting visual impairment. The blood-retinal barrier (BRB), primarily composed of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and endothelial cells, plays a crucial role in shielding the retina from pathogens. Its disruption has been linked to viral retinal infections. In vitro monitoring of infection on hTERT RPE-1 cells revealed an ability of ZIKV to persist for up to 30 days in nearly 10% of the cells. This prolonged infection was marked by low cytopathic effects but notable morphological changes throughout the cell layer, suggestive of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Long-lasting viral replication and production was associated with reduced expression of epithelial genes and increased expression of certain mesenchymal genes, suggesting that integrity of the RPE layer may be compromised.

EC-derived nitric oxide (NO), synthesized by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), is a vasodilator essential for improving blood flow and vascular homeostasis. The RhoA/ROCK pathway regulates eNOS levels, where overactivation decreases eNOS expression and downstream NO production. As such, RhoA/ROCK hyperactivity and increased pMLC have been identified as major contributors to age-associated vasoconstriction and hypertension. Intriguingly, recent studies identify Sun1, a key component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, as a major regulator of RhoA/ROCK activity. Moreover, endothelial aging deteriorates nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (i.e. nucleoporin [Nup93]) and impairs nucleocytoplasmic transport, thereby insinuating a role for nuclear envelope components in vessel homeostasis. Here, we show that targeted loss of endothelial Nup93 in adult mice significantly reduces eNOS expression and NO bioavailability for consequent defects in NO-dependent vasodilatory responses. In vitro knockdown of Nup93 in primary human ECs also decreases both eNOS expression and NO production. Mechanistically, we find that loss of Nup93 significantly reduces endothelial Sun1 levels for a concomitant increase in RhoA activity. Indeed, restoring Sun1 protein levels in Nup93-deficient ECs mitigates RhoA activity to rescue both eNOS expression and NO production.

Under homeostatic conditions, Lgr5+ crypt base columnar cells (CBCs) are considered the primary ISCs1,2. The supply of IECs, however, remains continuous even in the absence of Lgr5+ CBCs3, implying the existence of alternative ISC populations. Over the past decade, two contrasting models have emerged to explain the identities of these compensatory cells. The distinct cell population model proposes that slow-cycling, quiescent cells near the +4 position, act as reserve stem cells (rISCs)3-10. The cellular plasticity model suggests a broad spectrum of IECs can dedifferentiate into intermediate fetal-like states, thereby acquiring stemness11,12. It is unclear which of these models is correct because the signaling mechanisms governing crypt regenerative responses remain poorly understood.

This regenerative mechanism is fundamentally distinct from both classical self-renewal of existing Lgr5+ CBCs and fetal-like dedifferentiation in intestinal villi. By accelerating the cell cycle and driving clonal competition among stem cell pools, Hh signaling leaves rare dormant stem cells in the crypt and isthmus regions.

Numerous studies have shown that global warming advances phenology, with wide-ranging ecological consequences. However, the effects of water availability remain unclear and inconsistent across ecosystems. We hypothesized that part of this inconsistency arises from the overlooked temporal aspect of water stress. We therefore tested how drought timing influences species-level flowering phenology and community-level phenological niche partitioning. For this purpose, we established a system with 200 experimental annual-plant communities characteristic of a Mediterranean climate. We manipulated the wet season by imposing dry periods at the beginning, middle, or end. Plants were grown in monocultures and mixtures to separate direct physiological responses from competition-mediated effects. Early- and late-season droughts shortened the species' flowering duration: early drought delayed the onset of flowering, and late drought caused it to end sooner. Some of these shifts were direct responses to drought, while others were competition-mediated. Our new community-level index of niche partitioning revealed higher phenological segregation in mixtures than in monocultures. This indicates that phenotypic plasticity alone, without evolutionary adaptation, can promote niche separation under competition. Both early- and late-season droughts further increased niche-partitioning, with early drought also enhancing species diversity. Together, these results demonstrate that the seasonal timing of drought, not only its magnitude, governs plastic shifts in flowering phenology and reshapes competitive outcomes. Thus, our work identifies intra-annual rainfall patterns as a critical yet underappreciated driver of plant phenology and community structure under climate change.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

We analyzed the viral community in long-term sediment-free enrichments of alkane-degrading organisms and found that abiotic factors such as incubation temperature had a greater correlation with community composition than with the phylogenetic patterns among individual viral species. No auxiliary metabolic genes directly involved in hydrocarbon oxidation or sulfate reduction were found, but the presence of AMGs involved in heme synthesis pathways common in methane oxidizers hints at a possible viral impact on alkane degradation. We also found evidence supporting the presence of a viral genus infecting several phyla across both the bacterial and archaeal domains, including one of the sulfate-reducing bacterial partners in the alkane-oxidizing syntrophy. Lastly, we report the presence of nosD-like proteins in viruses from sediment-derived systems that are not present in water column datasets; their distribution, genomic context, and lack of canonical nosD characteristics suggest an alternate adhesion-related role in sediment communities.

A.", "abstract": "Microbiomes, which are collections of interacting microbes in an environment, often substantially impact the environmental patches or living hosts that they occupy. In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local dynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between environments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across multiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models commonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in which local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single parameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between those environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic environmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the microbiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with each other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time intervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such discrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the interaction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange during each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our framework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those regimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an illustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling framework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the dynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on the interplay between interaction frequency and strength.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

L.; Nadachowska-Brzyska, K.", "abstract": "The demographic history of species inferred from whole-genome data provides quantitative insights into key biological parameters such as population size changes and divergence times. Reliable estimates often require data that have not been affected by selection. Extensive research, however, indicates that many species harbour multiple polymorphic chromosomal inversions, which often evolve under different selective pressures. Consequently, inversions can influence genome-wide patterns of variation and subsequent evolutionary inferences. In this study, we used genome-wide data from over 300 spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) individuals from 23 populations across Europe to reconstruct their demographic history and to investigate the impact of a complex polymorphic inversion landscape (covering approximately 28% of the beetle genome) on demographic inference. We used two complementary methods, Pairwise Sequential Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) and Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS)-based modelling, and revealed a Late Pleistocene divergence (~79 kya) between populations from the southern and northern parts of the species European range, and a long-term effective population size of ~250,000. The southern group underwent significant population expansion after this divergence event, whereas the northern group expanded during the Holocene (~7 kya). Recent population size estimates suggest that the southern group is twice as large as the northern group. Neglecting the presence of chromosomal inversions did not significantly affect the model selection procedure and resulted in relatively small biases in the estimated demographic parameters. This study provides information on the historical population dynamics of the spruce bark beetle and improves our understanding of the influence of a complex genomic architecture on the inference of evolutionary history.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

However, currently available molecular clock methods, which often rely on simple homogeneous substitution models, can produce inaccurate time estimates, particularly for deep-time or rapidly evolving lineages where substitution heterogeneity and saturation are common. Hereby, we introduce phyloHessian (https://github.com/evolbeginner/phyloHessianWrapper), a Julia-based software to enable the use of complex mixture substitution models in molecular dating. phyloHessian employs different algorithms to improve the numerical accuracy in calculating the phylogenetic Hessian matrix, which is further integrated into PAML-MCMCtree's approximate likelihood framework to conduct dating analyses. Simulations mimicking phylogenies at different timescales demonstrate that complex mixture substitution models significantly enhance the accuracy of divergence time and substitution rate estimates in deep-time phylogenies. This pattern remains consistent across a wide range of uncertainties associated with molecular clock analysis. Additionally, mixture models display greater robustness to model and calibration specifications compared to their homogeneous counterparts. Empirical analysis of Microsporidia and Rickettsiales with different substitution models shows that mixture models, compared to homogeneous models, yield accelerated substitution rates and in some cases significantly different divergence times, leading to a revised understanding of their host association origins. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating complex mixture substitution models for constructing reliable evolutionary timelines and elucidating the evolutionary history of diverse deep-time lineages.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Kokia is a genus found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands, whose species were once major components of local forests but have experienced significant population reductions due to habitat destruction and the consequences of invasive species. Although conservation of Kokia species has been an ongoing topic for over a century, records regarding historical efforts are sparse. Recently generated genomes for each of the three extant species provide the foundation for understanding genetic diversity and population structure for future conservation work. Whole genome resequencing of K. cookei (n = 23 samples), K. drynarioides (n = 92), and K. kauaiensis (n = 45) suggests that K. drynarioides has the lowest overall diversity, reflecting propagation from a limited part of the remaining gene pool, whereas K. kauaiensis exhibits the most diversity. Diversity in the primarily graft-propagated K. cookei is higher than expected, and slightly higher than in the free-living K. drynarioides. Notably, our analyses identified a source of novel variation in K. cookei in a cultivated plant historically labeled K. drynarioides. Population structure analyses reveal a single population for K. cookei, but three groups for each of the other two species. Importantly, our analyses identify clusters of related individuals, reflected in genetic distance and clustering metrics, which provide valuable information for increasing diversity in managed populations and in ex situ conservation collections.

The infection of some human PVs (i.e., HPVs) are strongly associated with cancers, but it remains elusive how such pathogenicity got evolved at the genomic level. Here we performed a comprehensive super-pangenome analysis on a compendium of well-curated 3562 human and animal PV genomes. We found their global genomic diversity being strongly associated with their body sites and tissue origins, but not with their host, geographical, or disease specificity. By reconciling time-resolved phylogenies of PVs and their hosts, we revealed a high-resolution view on how intra-host codivergence, niche adaptation, horizontal host switches, and duplication/loss turnovers collectively shaped the evolution of PVs. We identified key selection-driven mutations that defined the genus-specific divergence and pathogenic risks of PVs, with the former highly enriched in the E1 gene and the latter showing contrasting genotype patterns between low-risk and high-risk HPVs. With independent clinical cohorts, we further demonstrated how these variants can be highly informative for HPV risk classification even at single site level, underscoring their application values in large-scale HPV screening tests. Finally, with cervical and oropharyngeal cancer patient cohorts assembled by this study, we further evaluated the prognostic value of specific HPV16 variants in predicting patient survival. Taken together, such illumination on the genome and pathogenicity evolution of PVs paves the road for better prevention, control, and treatment of PV-related cancers.\n\nSignificance StatementPapillomaviruses (PVs) are ancient and widespread DNA viruses co-evolved with many vertebrate hosts, including human.

Here we systematically investigated the genomic and evolutionary diversity of PVs via a pangenome study on over 3500 human and animal PV isolates, which revealed key selection-driven mutations shaping their genome and pathogenicity evolution. With independently acquired HPV-associated cancer cohorts, we further demonstrated how some of these important HPV variants can serve as clinically informative predictive and prognostic biomarkers.

In natural settings, perceivers adapt their motor-sensory strategies as they approach and explore objects, dynamically shaping both the generation and interpretation of sensory cues. Previous attempts to explain this process by reducing it solely to neuronal representations have failed to capture the mechanisms underlying dynamic perception. In this study, we use precise behavioral tracking to investigate the initial phase of object interaction, asking: What motor-sensory strategies support object detection during natural approach? Using high resolution video tracking of rats freely exploring objects under infrared illumination, we analyzed how head and whisker dynamics evolved across sequential contacts. We found that whisker-object interactions converged toward a distinct line, *, within a motor-sensory plane, where small changes in voluntary whisker movements produced large changes in whisker curvature, a sensory correlate of contact force. This convergence was actively controlled, predicted head movements and marked the completion of object approach. Convergence to * was consistent across different objects, suggesting it serves as an invariant motor-sensory contingency for object detection. Proximity to * predicted the emergence of touch-induced pumps, a rapid motor-sensory reflex that further facilitated convergence within a single whisking cycle. Together, these results reveal that object detection is a closed-loop dynamic process, in which animals actively steer motor-sensory dynamics toward a robust detection-optimized state.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Currently, there is growing interest in tailoring the physical properties of tissues and biomaterials to promote efficient tissue regeneration. Tridimensionality can profoundly influence macrophage behaviour; however, there is no clear consensus on the underlying mechanisms. 3D microstructures may play a crucial role in modulating immune cells, promoting anti-inflammatory responses, and supporting effective tissue repair and regeneration. In this study, we used two-photon polymerization to fabricate 3D scaffolds with large pores, measuring 50x50x20 m^3, and small pores, measuring 15x15x15 m^3. Both microstructures effectively influenced macrophage cytoskeletal organization and cellular metabolic activity. Notably, they were not sufficient to induce spontaneous macrophage polarization, indicating that they are intrinsically immunologically inert. When combined with chemical stimulation, as typically occurs in vivo, they elicited distinct responses. Specifically, as evidenced by the slight upregulation of the Arg1 marker, large pore sizes promoted an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Conversely, iNOS expression measurements indicated that small pores, which impose spatial constraints on macrophages, favoured a massive pro-inflammatory state. Our results demonstrate that 3D microstructures are versatile tools for multiple applications. Their precisely tunable architecture enables fine control over macrophage behaviour and immunomodulation, opening new avenues both for tissue engineering, by preventing fibrosis and promoting anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative responses in vivo, and for the development of in vitro platforms to model inflamed tissues for screening anti-inflammatory drugs.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Traditional text-mining methods struggle with understanding context across sentences. Additionally, these methods lack expert-level background knowledge, making it difficult to infer relationships that require awareness of concepts indirectly described in the text.

Animals rely on visual information from surrounding geometrical structures for navigation. Even at the microscale, various microsediments form complex structures in microbial habitats. The movement of microorganisms is passively affected by collisions and hydrodynamic interactions with surrounding structures. However, the influence of microenvironmental geometry on behavioral changes of unicellular organisms that lack visual perception remains unclear. Here, we developed geometrically structured chambers to investigate anchoring site preferences in the swimming ciliate Stentor coeruleus. S. coeruleus tended to anchor in narrow areas based on geometrical features such as corner angle, depth, and curvature at the corner end. Before anchoring, free-swimming S. coeruleus changed its behavior to move along the boundary wall of the chambers, accompanied by Ca2+-induced asymmetrical body deformation. To further investigate how S. coeruleus moves along the wall continuously, we conducted a hydrodynamic simulation and revealed that the asymmetric morphology causes asymmetric propulsive forces, explaining wall-following behavior through physical interactions with a wall. Thus, morphological change near a wall causes wall-following behavior, facilitating the identification of these narrow anchoring sites. Our findings indicate that environmental geometry drives behavioral transitions in S. coeruleus through simple biophysical processes, enabling spatial selection without visual cues. Overall, these results suggest that microgeometry plays a key role in shaping ecological niches for unicellular microorganisms.\n\nSignificance statementAnimals use various natural structures as landmarks for navigation. In microorganism habitats, microsediments also form geometrically complex environments. Is there a relationship between the geometrical features of structures and the behavior in unicellular organisms lacking visual cues? Here we report that the free-swimming unicellular organism, Stentor coeruleus, selects the anchoring sites depending on the surrounding shapes. Further observations and numerical simulations reveal that an asymmetric morphological change causes a temporary switch from ballistic to wall-following exploration, driven by surrounding structures. These results indicate that one simple behavioral response underlies the preference of anchoring sites with specific geometrical features in non-neural unicellular organisms.

Here, we identify a previously undocumented binary chemotype structure in cultivated upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), defined by the mutually exclusive production of either bisabolene or guaiene sesquiterpenes. Across 24 genotypes grown under field conditions, genotypes consistently produced one of these compounds, but never both, revealing a cryptic chemotypic polymorphism with physiological consequences. While drought stress reduced leaf water content across all plants, plants in the guaiene chemotype exhibited disproportionately greater losses. Water limitation also reduced total monoterpene and sesquiterpene concentrations, with the bisabolene chemotype showing stronger declines despite higher constitutive levels. Chemotypes further diverged in their biosynthesis of key damage-induced green leaf volatiles (GLVs). While the guaiene chemotype reduced GLV biosynthetic capacity under prolonged drought, the bisabolene chemotype showed transient increases in GLVs and pathway-specific enzyme activity under short-term stress, suggesting differential physiological resilience. Notably, all genotypes in this study fell within the low {gamma}-terpinene category previously described in wild cotton, indicating that this bisabolene/guaiene variation represents a novel axis of chemical diversity distinct from known wild chemotypes. These findings position chemotypic variation as a promising, non-destructive biomarker for drought response in cotton breeding programs.

L.; Tendler, B. C.; Cottaar, M.", "abstract": "Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) and water exchange via permeability operate on a similar spatiotemporal scale to water diffusion. In this study, we use a simulation-based approach to characterise how MT and permeability impact (1) diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) measurements from cylindrical substrates and (2) parameter estimation using a two-compartment model of white matter. Methods: We used Monte-Carlo simulations to model the dMRI signal inside and outside axons by simulating signals from parallel cylinders with different diameters and volume densities. We subsequently introduced membrane permeability and MT at the cylinder walls to investigate their impact on the dMRI signal. We fitted a two-compartment model to the simulated signal to produce estimates of the cylinder diameter and density. We evaluated the impact of MT and permeability by comparing the fitted diameter and density to the simulated ground truth. Results: Permeability leads to underestimation (up to 100%) of cylinder diameter and density. Specifically, by enabling isochromats to escape from restrictions and diffuse more freely, permeability makes the overall displacement profile closer to the extra-axonal displacement profile. MT had limited effects on diameter estimation but caused substantial bias (20-50%) in volume density estimates depending on the ratio of the intra-axonal and extra-axonal volume fraction. This is due to the intra-axonal and extra-axonal space having different surface-to-volume ratios and therefore different surface relaxation rates. Conclusion: Permeability and MT can considerably influence the dMRI signal. They increase the relative contribution from larger cylinders to the dMRI signal and bias microstructural parameter estimates derived from dMRI data.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Notably, coupling chemical with mechanical stimulation yields a synergistic enhancement of bioluminescence, achieving significantly greater amplitude and duration of light emission without compromising cell reactivity. Longitudinal studies over four weeks demonstrated that our living-light materials retain responsiveness and structural integrity across repeated stimulation cycles, overcoming the limitations of single-use mechanical activation.

To bridge this gap, we propose a physics-informed generative model leveraging self-supervised learning directly on experimental data. Our model extends the Deep Latent Particles (DLP) framework by incorporating a physical Point Spread Function (PSF) model into the decoder, enabling it to disentangle learned realistic environments from precise emitter properties. Trained directly on unlabeled experimental images, our model intrinsically captures realistic background, noise patterns, and emitter characteristics. The decoder thus acts as a high-fidelity generator, producing fully labeled, realistic training images with known emitter locations. Using these generated datasets significantly improves the performance of supervised localization algorithms, particularly in challenging scenarios such as complex backgrounds and low signal-to-noise ratios.

The protein LC8 is a small dimeric protein that acts as a dimerization hub for many clients through binding at a short linear motif. Many LC8 clients bind the protein multivalently, through repetition of the LC8-binding linear motif. While the exact function of each multivalent LC8 client is unique, these interactions are thought to play a structural role, rigidifying a disordered region of the client protein. Here, we present work that demonstrates that despite containing only weak LC8 binding motifs, KANK1 binds multivalently to LC8, driving LC8's localization to the cell cortex. Due to the weakness and non-canonical character of the LC8 binding sites on KANK1, experiments illustrated that prediction with our algorithm LC8Pred is insufficient to find all sites. AlphaFold was used to complement LC8Pred and locate the remaining binding sites. KANK1-LC8 binding is highly cooperative, with an overall binding affinity at least two orders of magnitude greater than the affinity of each individual LC8-binding motif. This cooperativity results in a complex that favors a homogenous, fully bound state. Multivalent AlphaFold predictions suggest assembly as a kinked-rod-like structure. We believe this cooperative complex serves a structural role, with the cooperativity building a rod, elongating a large disordered linker and enabling it to reach across the gap between the cell membrane and the ends of microtubules.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

To investigate this, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on matched WD and DD tumor regions. Both compartments shared a predominant population of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, but only WD regions contained cells expressing adipocytic differentiation markers and PPARG target genes. Given the central role of PPARG in coordinating lipid metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis during adipogenesis, these findings suggest that loss of this program may underlie the poorly differentiated, proliferative phenotype of DD LPS. Functional studies confirmed that PPARG activation in DD LPS cells induces lipid accumulation, reduces proliferation, and impairs tumor growth in vivo.

Our analysis revealed Ras-responsive element binding protein 1 (RREB1) as one of the most highly expressed transcription factors in G3 MB. RREB1 knockdown impaired cell proliferation in vitro and prolonged survival in orthotopic xenograft models, suggesting it plays a key role in regulating tumor growth. Mechanistically, RREB1 acts by enhancing transcription of TGF {beta} pathway genes. Upstream, RREB1 expression is controlled by c-MET signaling, and the MET inhibitor SU11274 decreased RREB1 levels and MB cell viability. Local delivery of SU11274 in tumor bearing mice suppressed RREB1 expression and extended survival.

It is caused by inactivating mutations in the ABCC6 gene, which encodes a hepatic efflux transporter. Loss of ABCC6 function leads to reduced plasma levels of pyrophosphate, a key inhibitor of calcification, thereby promoting ectopic mineralization. Oral pyrophosphate therapy has emerged as a potential treatment, but its effectiveness is uncertain. Most ingested pyrophosphate is hydrolyzed in the gut to inorganic phosphate, which may worsen calcification. Moreover, its impact on mineralized tissues remains largely unexplored. Abcc6-/- mice closely mimic human pseudoxanthoma elasticum and are widely used in preclinical studies. Although patients are most concerned about ocular complications, eye calcification is rarely assessed in translational studies using Abcc6-/- mice. Using microcomputed tomography we found that ectopic calcification at the ciliary margin is a reliable marker of ocular disease progression in these mice. Administering pyrophosphate in drinking water at concentrations up to 90 mM did not increase calcification in skin or eyes. However, only very high doses effectively prevented ectopic calcification - doses that would equate to an impractical 2.5 g/kg/day of disodium pyrophosphate in humans. These high doses also led to pyrophosphate accumulation in bone and negatively affected bone structure and strength. In summary, only supraphysiological doses of orally administered pyrophosphate inhibited ectopic calcification in Abcc6-/- mice, but these doses are not feasible for human use and may compromise bone function. These data are especially important considering the currently ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral pyrophosphate administration as a treatment for pseudoxanthoma elasticum.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Acylsugars are a class of specialized metabolites widely distributed across the Solanaceae that play a role in defense. Although acylsugars have been extensively characterized from leaf glandular trichomes, they have also been detected in other tissues. Nevertheless, acylsugar structures, biosynthesis, and functions outside of leaf trichomes remain unknown. Here, we performed tissue specific metabolomics across 29 Physalis species, an emerging model and crop genus closely related to important Solanum crops. Automated mass spec feature identification and library searches from surface extracts of leaf, calyx, and fruit tissues revealed metabolite diversity including putative metabolite classes of flavonoids, phenolics, and terpenoids. Acylsugar mass spec features were manually annotated, revealing at least 323 unique acylsugars - substantially expanding the known Physalis acylsugar diversity. Some, but not all, Physalis species accumulated acylsugars on the trichome-less fruit surface, and were as abundant or sometimes more abundant, in fruits than in leaves or calyces. Hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic tests indicated that species with similar acylsugar profiles do not cluster taxonomically. To determine the biochemical mechanism underlying acylsugar structural diversity, we characterized the first step of acylsugar biosynthesis, catalyzed by an acylsugar acyltransferase (ASAT). ASAT1s from three Physalis species displayed broad substrate preferences, which may explain the differences in acylsugar profiles.

C.; Xie, Y.; Southwell, A. L.", "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene encoding an elongated polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. The use of biomarkers has become a major component in preclinical studies focusing on HTT lowering strategies. Quantification of soluble mutant HTT (mHTT) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has served as a pharmacodynamic readout and as potential disease progression biomarker. However, development of future assays for HTT measurement from other biofluids, such as blood, will facilitate the access to human samples since CSF collection is an invasive outpatient procedure. Brain cells, in particular neurons, secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that cross the blood-brain barrier and circulate in blood. Importantly, EVs have been identified to be involved in HTT export from cells to the extracellular space. However, it is unknow which vesicle subtype correlates better with HD progression. Our work investigates the potential of EVs as non-invasive sources of clinical biomarkers in liquid biopsies. We developed an optimized ultracentrifugation protocol for the purification of ectosomes and exosomes from human samples and plasma of humanized HD mouse models. Ectosomes are larger vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane of cells, whereas exosomes originate from multivesicular bodies and are afterwards released to the extracellular space. Consistent with previous published data in other model systems, ectosomes isolated from plasma of the Hu97/18 mouse model contain both wild-type (WT) and mHTT in higher levels than in exosomes. Similar results were observed in media from HD iPSC-differentiated neurons and in Hu97/18 primary neuronal cultures. Interestingly, we also found higher levels of HTT transcripts in this EV subtype. We further demonstrate that initial storage of the samples using a slow freezing protocol preserves HTT and EV protein marker levels, highlighting the importance of sample preparation for EV isolation and analysis. Our results also show that plasma contains vesicles originated from neuronal cells that can be isolated using neuron-specific markers, such as ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 3 (ATP1A3), allowing the evaluation of HTT levels in the brain through vesicles circulating in the blood. Overall, our results demonstrate that HTT protein measurement from EVs isolated from blood can be a potential less-invasive disease biomarker. We also demonstrate that EVs subtypes contain different HTT protein and RNA levels, important for the development of consistent and reliable biomarkers. Further characterization of neuron-specific EVs content from patient-derived biofluids will lead to the development of novel clinical biomarkers and for evaluation of therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Animals must continuously adapt their behavioral outputs in response to changes in internal state, including nutritional state. Here, we show that starvation induces a profound and progressive suppression of thermonociceptive behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans. The thermoresponsive sensory neurons AWCs mediate robust heat-evoked reversals over a broad range of stimulus intensities via glutamate and FLP-6 neuropeptide signaling, each covering distinct heat intensity ranges. After six hours of food deprivation, heat-evoked reversal responses are nearly abolished, independently of any external food odor cues. Prolonged food deprivation triggers a switch in AWC heat-evoked activity patterns, transitioning from a predictable, stimulus-locked response mode to a heterogeneous and stochastic regime. This switch relies on ASI neurons, proposed to work as internal state-sensing neurons. INS-32 and NLP-18 neuropeptide signals from ASI switch from a reversal-promoting to a reversal-inhibiting effect. Glutamatergic transmission from non-AWC neurons is also engaged to suppress reversals. Our findings define a circuit logic by which nociceptive responsiveness gating by internal nutritional state is linked to dynamic modulation of sensory neuron activity patterns and orchestrated by bidirectional glutamatergic and neuropeptidergic signals. More broadly, this study illustrates how sensory systems integrate metabolic information to prioritize behavioral outputs under changing physiological conditions, providing mechanistic insight into the plastic coupling between sensation, internal state, and action selection.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Improvements in neuroimaging technologies over the past decades have led to advancements in understanding of the sulcal organization of the human cerebral cortex, yet comparisons to chimpanzees, one of humans' closest extant phylogenetic relatives, remain to be performed in many regions, such as superior temporal cortex. For example, while several posterior branches, or rami, of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) have been identified in great apes since the late 1800s, no study has yet to comprehensively identify and quantitatively compare these rami across species. To fill this gap in knowledge, in the present study, we defined the three caudal branches of the STS (cSTS) in 72 human and 29 chimpanzee brains (202 total hemispheres) and then extracted and compared the morphological (depth and surface area) properties of these sulci. We report three main findings. First, modern methods replicate classic findings that three rami of the posterior STS are unique to the hominid lineage (i.e., humans and great apes). Second, normalizing for brain size, the cSTS rami were relatively deeper in chimpanzees compared to humans. Third, the cSTS branches were relatively larger in surface area in humans compared to chimpanzees. Finally, we share probabilistic predictions of the cSTS to guide the identification of these sulci in future studies. Altogether, these findings bridge the gap between historic qualitative observations and modern quantitative measurements in a part of the brain that has expanded substantially throughout evolution and that is involved in human-specific aspects of cognition.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Participants memorised matched auditory and visual sequences with coherent temporal structure and later identified whether test sequences were familiar or novel. Multivariate decoding revealed robust discrimination between the brain mechanisms underlying encoding and recognition of memorised and novel sequences, with sustained temporal generalisation in the auditory domain and time-specific responses in the visual domain. Using the BROAD-NESS pipeline, we identified modality-specific and supramodal brain networks. Auditory memory engaged auditory cortex, cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus, whereas visual memory involved orbitofrontal cortex and visual areas.

In this study, we investigated how variability in physical exertion affects effort assessment in individuals with MS compared to healthy participants. We had participants exert varying levels of physical effort and retrospectively assess the effort they exerted. Individuals with MS exhibited increased exertion variability and tended to overreport their levels of exertion compared to healthy participants. Increased exertion variability was associated with less accurate effort assessment, and this effect was more pronounced in individuals with more advanced MS. These results suggest a possible mechanism through which motor variability may be associated with inflated perceptions of effort in MS, highlighting a potential account of why efforts feel particularly costly to those individuals living with MS and identifying a promising target for treatment and rehabilitation.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

However, the diversity and specificity of NKG2D receptor ligands among sensory neuron subtypes, and translation of this mechanism to humans, remains unknown. We used dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons cultured from C57BL/6J mice of both sexes with fluorescently-labelled sensory neuron lineages (Scn10a, Mrgprd, Calca, Trpv1, Th, Thy1), as well as human induced pluripotent stem cell derived (hiPSCd)-sensory neurons after laser ablation, as in vitro models of axonal injury. We assessed expression of NKG2D ligands by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) corroborated by publicly available RNA sequencing datasets and validated with single-cell PCR. Recombinant NKG2D receptor proteins in live cell-based assays were used to reveal the subcellular membrane localisation of NKG2D ligands with quantification by a semi-automated image analysis. Functional interactions between human NK cells and sensory neurons were confirmed with co-cultures in microfluidic devices. We show that NKG2D ligands are expressed exclusively in unmyelinated DRG neurons after injury. NKG2D-receptors bound to puncta along distal neurites of injured axons enriched predominantly in Mrgprd-expressing non-peptidergic nociceptors. We observed low-level binding of human NKG2D-receptors to neurites of hiPSCd sensory neurons that increased after axonal laser ablation. Degeneration of hiPSCd sensory neurons neurites by interleukin (IL-2) primed human NK cells was prevented by an NKG2D blocking antibody. The induction and enrichment of functional NKG2D receptor ligands selectively on pathological nerve fibres could aid the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy in chronic pain conditions, and sheds new light on the potential role of nociceptive neurons in regulating the local tissue immune microenvironment.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we comprehensively assessed the membrane proteome for binding of -syn fibrils. Expression cloning identified mGluR4 and Npdc1 as plasma membrane proteins expressed by substantia nigra neurons capable of supporting high affinity -syn fibril binding. Moreover, mGluR4 and Npdc1 cellular signaling functions were titrated by the presence of extracellular fibrillary -syn.

Forced-choice psychophysical methods combined with the method of constant stimuli or parametric adaptive trial-placement procedures are well-suited for measuring one-dimensional psychometric functions. However, extending these methods to characterize psychometric fields in higher-dimensional stimulus spaces, such as three-dimensional color space, poses a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a novel Wishart Process Psychophysical Model (WPPM) that leverages the smooth variation of threshold across stimulus space. We demonstrate the use of the WPPM in conjunction with a non-parametric adaptive trial-placement procedure by characterizing the full psychophysical field for color discrimination in the isoluminant plane. Each participant (N = 8) completed between 6,000 and 6,466 three-alternative forced-choice (3AFC) oddity color discrimination trials. The WPPM was fit to these trials. Importantly, once fit, the WPPM allows readout of discrimination performance between any pair of stimuli, providing a comprehensive characterization of the psychometric field. In addition, the WPPM readouts were validated for each participant by comparison with 25 probe psychometric functions. These were measured with an additional 6,000 trials per participant that were held out from the WPPM fit.

By combining neuronal recordings with functional digital twin models---deep learning-based predictive models of biological neurons---we were able to systematically identify each neuron's preferred and non-preferred features. These feature pairs served as anchors for a continuous, low-dimensional axis in natural image similarity space, along which neuronal activity varied approximately linearly. Within a single visual area, visual features that strongly or weakly activated individual neurons also had a high probability of modulating the activity of other neurons, suggesting a shared feature selectivity across the population that structures stimulus encoding.

Implicated in neuropathologies including seizures, migraine with aura, traumatic brain injury, and stroke, SD is experimentally induced in animals by electrical stimulation, mechanical injury, hypoxia, elevated extracellular potassium, and various other techniques. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying SD initiation remain unclear. Prior research in rodents found that simultaneously blocking sodium, calcium, and glutamatergic (AMPA and NMDA) channels prevents SD induction whereas inhibiting any two of these three currents is insufficient. This suggests that SD induction could be a product of overstimulation of any single known inward cationic current. However, some researchers propose that SD induction occurs via an unknown SD channel. To further explore the role of known inward cationic currents in SD induction, we applied high potassium to two biological models, namely zebrafish and mice. First, we developed a novel ex vivo zebrafish model to assess SD induction in the optic tectum. Using KCl microinjection and DC local field potential recordings, we found that inhibition of sodium, calcium, and glutamatergic channels significantly decreased SD amplitude but never blocked SD induction in the zebrafish optic tectum. Similar pharmacological experiments in hippocampal mouse slices (CA1 subregion) also confirmed that SDs persist despite the same pharmacological cocktail.

Although over 50 monogenic causes have been identified, many remain unresolved. PRPF8 is a core spliceosome component, essential for pre-mRNA splicing, and further localizes to the distal mother centriole to promote ciliogenesis. Methods: We performed trio exome sequencing in 208 CAKUT families and identified strong variants in PRPF8 and the EDD-DYRK2-DDB1VprBP complex. Functional validation included splicing assays in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in RPE-1 cells, co-immunoprecipitation for protein complex assembly, and in situ hybridization in mouse embryos. Protein interactions were modeled using AlphaFold. Results: We identified heterozygous de novo or inherited variants in PRPF8, DYRK2, DDB1, EDD and CEP78. Yeast assays revealed that while most PRPF8 variants preserved growth and splicing at consensus splice sites, the de novo PRPF8R1681W variant impaired splicing of non-consensus splice sites and was inviable at elevated temperature. CAKUT variants failed to rescue prp28-1 and U4-cs1 alleles but showed variant-specific synthetic interactions with brr2-1, including weak suppression or synthetic sickness at elevated temperatures. Shh signaling was reduced in ~50% of PRPF8 variants expressed in RPE-1 cells. CEP78 truncating variants abrogated binding to CEP350 and VPRBP. Two DYRK2 variants disrupted EDD-DYRK2-DDB1VprBP complex formation without affecting kinase activity. In situ hybridization revealed strong Prpf8 expression in the developing collecting duct and urothelium. Conclusion: Variants in PRPF8 and components of the EDD-DYRK2-DDB1VprBP complex may contribute to CAKUT through impaired pre-mRNA splicing and defective ciliogenesis. These findings uncover an entirely new functional network of candidate genes for CAKUT and ciliopathies, significantly broadening our understanding of disease mechanisms and offering novel entry points for mechanistic studies.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

While single-cell T- and B-cell receptor sequencing has provided fundamental insights into the clonal dynamics of human adaptive immunity, the lack of appropriate tools has precluded similar analysis of innate immune cells. Here, we describe a method that leverages somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to reconstruct clonal lineage relationships between single cells across cell types in native human tissues. We jointly sequenced single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin and mtDNA to profile n=124,958 cells from matched tumor, non-involved lung tissue (NILT), and peripheral blood of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, as well as n=93,757 cells from matched tumor and peripheral blood of ovarian cancer patients. Single-cell concomitant profiling of lineage and cell states of thousands of immune cells resolved clonality across cell types, tissue sites, and malignancies. Clonal tracing of innate immune cells demonstrates that TME-resident myeloid subsets, including macrophages and type 3 dendritic cells (DC3), are clonally linked to both circulating and tissue-infiltrating monocytes. Further, we identify distinct DC-biased and macrophage-biased myeloid clones, enriched in the tumor and NILT, respectively, and find that their circulating monocyte precursors exhibit distinct epigenetic profiles, suggesting that myeloid differentiation fate may be predetermined before TME infiltration. These results delineate the clonal pathways of intratumoral myeloid cell recruitment and differentiation in human cancer and suggest that remodeling of the tumor myeloid compartment may be peripherally programmed.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

In Caenorhabditis elegans, self-fertilizing hermaphrodites produce a limited number of self-sperm, and previous studies have suggested that hermaphrodites avoid males. However, the behavioral dynamics of this male-avoidance behavior remain largely unexplored and its underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. Here, I quantitatively analyzed male-avoidance behavior in C. elegans hermaphrodites by measuring locomotor speed in the presence of males. Automated image analysis revealed that wildtype hermaphrodites increased speed when in contact with males, indicating active avoidance behavior. In contrast, avoidance was significantly reduced in sperm-deficient mutant hermaphrodites and aged hermaphrodites that had exhausted self-sperm. Similarly, females of gonochoristic Caenorhabditis species, which lack self-sperm, also showed no avoidance of males. These results suggest that the presence of self-sperm promotes male avoidance, likely to favor self-fertilization. Interestingly, hermaphrodites that had previously mated with males showed reduced male avoidance. Given that male-derived sperm outcompete self-sperm for fertilization, continued avoidance after mating may be no longer advantageous for reproduction. These findings highlight the adaptive nature of sperm-dependent male avoidance in C. elegans hermaphrodites.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

As such, early detection and disease diagnosis are critical for effective treatment and symptom management. Cardiac auscultation, the process of listening to the heartbeat, often provides the first indication of underlying cardiac conditions. This practice allows for the identification of heart murmurs caused by turbulent blood flow. In this exploratory research paper, we propose an AI model to streamline this process that improves diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Methods: We utilized data from the 2022 George Moody PhysioNet Heart Sound Classification Challenge, comprised of phonocardiogram recordings of individuals under 21 years of age in Northeast Brazil. Only patients who had recordings from all four heart valves were included in our dataset. Audio files were synchronized across all recordings and converted to Mel spectrograms before being passed into a pre-trained Vision Transformer, and finally a MiniROCKET model. Additionally, data augmentation was conducted on audio files and spectrograms to generate new data, bringing our total sample size from 928 spectrograms to 14,848. Results: Compared to existing methodologies, our model yielded significantly enhanced quality assessment metrics, including Weighted Accuracy, Sensitivity, and F-Score, as well as a faster evaluation speed of 0.02 seconds per patient. Conclusion: The implementation of our method for the detection of heart murmurs can supplement physician diagnosis and contribute to earlier detection of underlying cardiovascular conditions, faster diagnosis times, increased scalability, and enhanced adaptive abilities.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Applied to the iron-binding protein DtxR from Corynebacterium glutamicum, CoBiSe identified a flexible connective loop (residues 138-150) for inserting the reporter module, resulting in IronSenseR, a novel ratiometric biosensor for ferrous iron (Fe). IronSenseR demonstrates high specificity for Fe with dissociation constants of 1.55 plus minus 0.08 microM (FeSO) and 2.44 plus minus 0.28 microM (FeCl2), while showing no binding to Fe3+ and other divalent cations. In vivo assessment in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Corynebacterium glutamicum confirmed IronSenseR's capability to detect changes in the intracellular iron pool.

Poly(U) is a single-stranded RNA composed of uracil repeats that acts as a toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist, stimulating the innate immune system. However, poly(U) is susceptible to ribonuclease degradation without a delivery carrier, and its negative charge hinders cellular uptake. Encapsulation in acetalated dextran (Ace-DEX), a pH-sensitive, biodegradable polymer, addresses these challenges. This study encapsulated poly(U) into Ace-DEX Microparticles (MPs) with either spherical (smooth MPs) or collapsed-surface (wrinkled MPs) via spray-drying. It was hypothesized that the different morphologies of MPs would influence the vaccine efficacy after in vitro and in vivo models. Smooth poly(U) MPs had a higher percent viability and cytokine response in dendritic cells (DCs) than wrinkled poly(U) MPs. Moreover, mice vaccinated with smooth poly(U) MPs + ovalbumin (OVA) showed enhanced IL-2 production and IFN-{gamma} in response to OVA peptide and MHC-I immunodominant peptide restimulation, respectively, compared to wrinkled poly(U) MPs. However, mice vaccinated with wrinkled poly(U) MPs + OVA significantly increased B-cell and germinal center B-cell frequencies compared to mice vaccinated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) whereas mice vaccinated with smooth poly(U) MPs + OVA did not. Overall, these findings suggest that smooth poly(U) MPs modulated dendritic cells and T-cells, and wrinkled poly(U) MPs modulated B-cells.

But what other records can attest to the deep history of enzymes, and what tools are needed to decode their meaning? Here, we demonstrate that the history of enzyme discovery and reuse is embedded within the web of interdependencies that constitute contemporary, biosphere-scale metabolism. Using a simple network analysis approach, we reconstruct both the relative temporal ordering of enzyme domain emergence and, where possible, the first reactions that they catalyzed. These network-based histories were found to be broadly concordant with phyletic information, suggesting that the two approaches reflect related generative processes. When enzyme emergence is initiated after the discovery of nucleotide cofactors, a predominantly stepwise trajectory of domain discovery is recovered. We find that the earliest enzyme-mediated metabolisms were dominated by /{beta} domains, likely due to their high discoverability and functional potential under constraint. Finally, we quantify how the protein universe responded to a major transition, the biological production of molecular oxygen, by preferentially reusing pre-existing enzyme domains.

The past decade has seen burgeoning interest in microglia function, with a variety of transgenic tools developed for specific genetic manipulation of microglia in various injury, disease, and developmental models. Although the majority of models have been developed in mice, the ability to manipulate microglia in rats provides additional advantages to studying microglial function in the brain especially related to complex behavior. Using BAC transgenesis, our lab has created a transgenic rat (Cx3cr1-CreERT2) that expresses a tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase (CreERT2) under control of the microglial/macrophage specific fractalkine C-X3-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 1 (Cx3cr1) promoter. In mice, CreERT2 and other transgenes have been expressed in microglia using the Cx3cr1 promoter, however, this is the first demonstration in rats. Importantly, these rats exhibit similar cognitive behaviors compared to their wildtype (WT) controls. Microglial specificity of inducible Cre expression was confirmed by breeding the novel Cx3cr1-CreERT2+/- rat with a previously reported double floxed inverse open reading frame (DIO)-mCherry+/- reporter rat to show tamoxifen inducible mCherry expression that colocalizes with the microglial marker Iba1. In addition, we utilize flow cytometry to demonstrate time and Cre dependent differences in recombination of Cx3cr1+ cells in the spleen, peripheral blood, and brain at two- and eight-weeks post-tamoxifen treatment.

The cochlear nucleus, the first central auditory structure to receive input from the cochlea, has been shown to be disrupted by ARHL. Fusiform cells (FC), the principal output cell of the dorsal part of the cochlear nucleus (DCN), mature physiologically during hearing onset. Specifically, FCs increase in rate of action potential (AP) rise and decay, stabilizing by postnatal day 14 (P14) in mice. However, whether FC intrinsic electrophysiological properties and morphological characteristics continue to change throughout the life of mice, and how they change due to ARHL, is unknown. We characterized electrophysiological and morphological properties of FCs from CBA/CaJ mice at five stages of age: preweaning (P15-20), pubescent (P21-49), young adult (P50-179), mature adult (P180-364), and old adult (P550-578). Our old adult mice had smaller auditory brainstem evoked response amplitudes and loss of some hair cells, indicative of ARHL onset. We observed no change in FC membrane properties with age. FCs from the old adult group had elevated firing rates, faster repolarization rates, and shorter AP half-widths. Morphologically, there was no change in FC soma shape or size. However, a significant decrease in basal dendritic arborization occurred between preweaning and pubescent ages, followed by an increase in our old adult group, suggesting age-dependent remodeling of the basal dendritic tree at the onset of ARHL. Together, these results suggest that FC physiology and morphology are relatively stable post weaning and become altered during the onset of ARHL.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Background: Our labs have demonstrated exercise is protective in animal models of retinal degeneration (RD). Inflammation drives RD progression, and is regulated by the recruitment and reactivity of glia cells as well as through small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we explore the effects of treadmill exercise on the recruitment and reactivity of retinal inflammatory cells within the neural retina and miRNA expression in a light-induced retinal degeneration model (LIRD) that exhibits phenotypes found in patients with RD. Methods: Male 6-week-old BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to either active or inactive groups. Active groups were exercised by treadmill 1 hour a day for two weeks at a speed of 10m/min, meanwhile inactive groups were placed on static treadmills for the same duration. Light induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) was induced during the second week of exercise using light exposure of 5000 lux, control animals were kept at 50 lux. Retinal function was assessed using electroretinography (ERG) 5 days after LIRD. Retinas were collected 1-day and 5-days post-LIRD, sagittal sections were stained for inflammatory markers (GFAP and Iba1), TUNEL (cell death), and photoreceptor nuclei (outer nuclear layer; ONL) were quantified. RNA was extracted and miRNA expression quantified with GeneChip miRNA 4.0 array. Results: Active+LIRD mice demonstrated significant preservation of retinal function, evidenced by higher a-wave and b-wave amplitudes in ERG 5-days post-LIRD, compared to inactive+LIRD mice. Retinal sections from active+LIRD mice had fewer Iba1+ cells and decreased GFAP labeling 5-days post-LIRD compared to inactive+LIRD mice. Active+LIRD mice had fewer ONL TUNEL+ cells compared to inactive+LIRD mice. Inactive+LIRD mice showed a decline in ONL counts 1-day post-LIRD with significant loss 5-days post-LIRD compared to active+LIRD mice. In active groups, exercise promoted significant differences in miRNA expression, such as miR-302b, miR-192-5p, miR-187 compared to inactive groups. Conclusions: Our results indicate that treadmill exercise preserved photoreceptor density, slowed and or prevented apoptosis in the ONL, and decreased the presence/recruitment of inflammatory cells in the neural retina. Altered miRNA expression profiles in active groups are associated with cell survival (miR-302b), oxidative stress regulation (miR-192-5p) and photoreceptor homeostasis (miR-187). These results reveal how exercise alters the retinal inflammatory response over the course of 1-day to 5-days, providing insight into exercise-based therapies and treatments for RD and neuroinflammatory diseases.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

We show that in normal and accelerated ageing cells, POLG1, the enzyme responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication, is degraded by the protease cathepsin B, which is overexpressed, escapes from lysosomes, and is stabilized by the chaperone activity of another protease, HTRA3. This degradation is in part counteracted by RAC1, a small GTPase also stabilized by HTRA3. POLG1 depletion, that occurs in progeroid Cockayne syndrome and senescent cells, is linked respectively to impairment or downregulation of the CSB protein, which promote cellular senescence. Our experiments in engineered cells, demonstrate that senescence itself, and not the absence of CSB, triggers the accumulation of cathepsin B and HTRA3, leading to POLG1 degradation. In summary, we uncover a complex, multi-step process that controls the degradation of POLG1 in mitochondria, a process that is activated by cell senescence and becomes more pronounced in Cockayne syndrome cells, providing new insight in the regulation of mitochondrial proteostasis in ageing and progeroid disorders.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

While therapies targeting Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) have shown success in neuroblastoma with relevant mutations, patients with MYCN-amplified tumors lacking these mutations have limited treatment options. This study aimed to investigate whether inhibition of ALK impacted on the therapeutic potential of targeting replication stress in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma in the absence of activating ALK mutations. Experimental Design: We used a MYCN-driven genetically engineered mouse model of neuroblastoma. Genetic deletion of ALK was performed to assess its role in MYCN-driven tumor development. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein, alone or in combination with ALK inhibition, was tested in tumor bearing mice over a 14-day treatment period and 200 day follow-up period. Results: Genetic removal of ALK significantly reduced tumor penetrance in mice with MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. Treatment with the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein inhibitor led to survival benefit, which was significantly enhanced when combined with anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibition. Combination treatment resulted in durable tumor suppression and extended survival beyond that achieved with monotherapy.

A key question is how innate immune cells sense and process microbes in the gut lumen, eliciting appropriate protective responses without causing tissue injury. Clearance of invading microbes and initiation of downstream inflammatory responses are central to this process and require proper function of the endolysosomal system. Dysfunction of this system can predispose the host to chronic inflammatory disorders and acute infections. Here, through forward genetic screening of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-mutagenized mice and CRISPR/Cas9 validation, we identify Lrmda, encoding leucine-rich melanocyte differentiation-associated protein (LRMDA), as a key regulator of intestinal homeostasis. Using hematopoietic chimera and conditional knockouts, we show that LRMDA functions primarily in CD11c+ cells, including mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, but not in non-hematopoietic cells. Proteomic, cellular, and biochemical analyses reveal that LRMDA directly and cooperatively interacts with the endolysosome-specific small GTPase Rab32 and the endosomal recycling complex Retriever. Loss of LRMDA or Retriever function increases susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and impairs clearance of Listeria monocytogenes.

This study investigated whether TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) deficiency influences cardiac protection through mitochondrial quality control pathways. METHODS: We generated both whole-body and cardiomyocyte-specific TIGAR knockout mice that were assessed for cardiac function following myocardial infarction (induced by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation) and diet-induced cardiomyopathy (using a 6-month high-fat diet protocol). Mitochondrial quality control was evaluated through mitophagy assays, subcellular fractionation, and molecular analyses. Epigenetic regulation was assessed using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and CRISPR-mediated gene editing in multiple cell lines. RESULTS: Both whole-body (TKO) and cardiomyocyte-specific (hTKO) TIGAR knockout mice demonstrated cardioprotection following myocardial infarction. These animals maintained significantly better ejection fraction (43.35{+/-}17.76% vs 26.36{+/-}9.83% in wild-type controls, P<0.05) and displayed complete resistance to diet-induced cardiac hypertrophy, despite comparable weight gain. TIGAR deficiency led to dramatic increases in Parkin expression across multiple tissues, 6-fold increases in heart and muscle, and 5-fold increases in brain, which enhanced mitophagic responses during metabolic stress conditions including fasting and high-fat diet feeding. Generation of Parkin/TIGAR double knockout mice eliminated this protection, confirming Parkin's essential role. Notably, adult manipulation of TIGAR through viral overexpression or knockdown failed to alter Parkin levels, suggesting developmental programming. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed reduced DNA methylation in a specific 3.2 kb region within Parkin gene intron 10, and CRISPR deletion of this regulatory region increased Parkin expression 10-fold in C2C12 myoblasts and 6-fold in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a novel TIGAR-Parkin regulatory axis operating through epigenetic mechanisms during cardiac development to establish lifelong cardioprotection via enhanced mitochondrial quality control. This discovery points toward new therapeutic approaches targeting developmental metabolic programming for heart disease prevention and identifies specific epigenetic targets for cardiovascular therapy.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

This study examines the distribution of multi-functional community traits (MFCT) and their environmental drivers across mangrove functional groups (pioneer, mid-successional, climax) along salinity gradients in the Sundarbans, the worlds largest mangrove forest. Using data from 62 plots, nine functional traits from 17 mangrove species were analysed to evaluate MFCT diversity and its environmental determinants. Results revealed distinct variations in MFCT diversity, with mid-successional species exhibiting the highest trait diversity (64.0 {+/-} 1.58), followed by climax (51.3 {+/-} 2.09) and pioneer groups (50.2 {+/-} 2.26). Climax species demonstrated resilience to salinity increases (R2 = 0.29, p < 0.001), whereas mid-successional and pioneer groups were negatively affected (R2 = 0.22, p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.17, p < 0.001). Annual precipitation exerted contrasting effects, reducing diversity in climax species (R2 = 0.25, p < 0.001) but enhancing it in mid-successional (R2 = 0.22, p < 0.001) and pioneer groups (R2 = 0.06, p = 0.05). Notably, MFCT values remained stable across salinity gradients, underscoring the ecosystems functional resilience. These findings highlight mid-successional species as keystones in sustaining mangrove multifunctionality and resilience under environmental stressors. Prioritizing these species in conservation and restoration efforts can mitigate the impacts of salinity intrusion and climate variability. By integrating the MFCT framework, resource managers can develop targeted restoration strategies to enhance ecosystem functionality and long-term stability. These insights provide a critical foundation for policymakers to align global mangrove conservation with adaptive management strategies, reinforcing coastal resilience, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

At opposite ends of the spectrum lie two contrasting evolutionary models: phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibria. Under a phyletic gradualism framework, evolutionary change accumulates along lineages and species are steadily transformed into new forms over time. In contrast, under punctuated equilibria, evolutionary change tends to occur in bursts at speciation events. Previous studies of molecular and morphological data have found varying levels of support for the two evolutionary models. We examined these models using comprehensive molecular and morphological data sets from 40 clades across the Tree of Life. Testing for associations between species richness and the amount of evolutionary change in sister clades, we find little evidence to support the punctuated equilibria model. However, we found high levels of among-lineage rate variation in molecular evolution and particularly morphological evolution. Our comparison of coding and non-coding genomic regions revealed contrasting patterns of among-lineage rate variation, without clear trends across taxa. Our study confirms that heterotachy is a dominant feature in macroevolution and that molecular and morphological evolution cannot simply be described by either a gradual or punctuated model.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Our package is broadly applicable across species and social settings, including single individuals, pairs and groups, and implements a validation tool to separate behavioral edge cases. vassi has comparable performance to existing approaches on a behavioral classification benchmark, the CALMS21 mouse resident-intruder dataset, and we demonstrate its applicability on a novel, more naturalistic and complex dataset of cichlid fish groups.

MINDY3 is architecturally distinct from other MINDY DUBs as its catalytic domain spans the entire length of the protein except for an atypical EF-hand insertion. We uncover this EF-hand (MINDY3EF-hand) to be a ubiquitin-binding domain with three distinct binding sites, enabling MINDY3 to bind and effectively cleave long polyubiquitin chains. Furthermore, the MINDY3EF-hand domain binds not only to polyubiquitin but also to the UBL domain of the proteasome shuttling and DNA repair factors RAD23A and RAD23B. The MINDY3EF-hand facilitates this interaction with RAD23s and mediates MINDY3 recruitment to DNA damage sites, establishing this unique DUB as a potential regulator of cellular DNA damage responses. MINDY3 binds only to the UBL domain of RAD23s, and none of the other UBLs tested. The crystal structure of the MINDY3EF-hand:RAD23AUBL domain complex reveals the molecular basis for specificity. We find that MINDY3 can form a ternary complex with RAD23A/B and polyubiquitin, and our findings suggest a model wherein MINDY3 can deubiquitylate RAD23A/B-bound clients.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

However, their performance under biologically realistic conditions remains poorly understood. Standard clustering methods commonly applied in crop research often assume distinct, isotropic, and homogeneous clusters--assumptions rarely satisfied in real-world NUS datasets. We developed a biologically informed simulation framework, empirically calibrated with phenotypic data from West African fonio (Digitaria exilis), to benchmark the performance of eleven clustering algorithms under both idealized and realistic scenarios. Our simulations integrated heterogeneous trait distributions (normal, gamma), strong inter-trait correlations (up to r = -0.84), heteroscedasticity, and moderate population structure (Pst {approx} 0.15), as observed in fonio landraces. Each scenario was replicated 100 times, with clustering accuracy evaluated using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Silhouette coefficient, and Davies-Bouldin index. The results revealed consistently poor algorithm performance under realistic conditions (e.g., ARI < 0.07), including for widely used methods in NUS research such as K-means, GMM, and PAM. Performance markedly improved under idealized conditions, validating our simulation framework. These findings highlight the risk of overinterpreting clustering outputs from weakly structured phenotypic datasets and expose key limitations in current biodiversity analysis practices--particularly those guiding plant genetic resource conservation programs.

Data on the participation of OMVs in the symbiotic relationship between plant-beneficial bacteria and plants are even more limited and are mainly related to the rhizobia-legume interaction. To investigate the interaction of OMVs of non-rhizobial phytobeneficial bacteria with plant cells, we isolated and characterized OMVs produced by Paraburkholderia phytofirmans PsJN, a strain well known for its growth-promoting and stress-protective effects in a wide range of plant species. Using OMVs labelled with fluorescent lipid-binding dye VybrantTM DiD and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we showed that PsJN-OMVs interact directly with the root hairs and epidermal cells of Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato. Moreover, by employing octadecyl-rhodamine B chloride (R18), we demonstrated that PsJN-OMVs can fuse with plant cell membranes.

To address this gap, 36 individuals with AUD and 34 healthy controls performed an incentive delay task to assess social reward anticipation with a monetary and a non-reward control condition while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The ventral striatum was defined as region of interest because of its central role in neuronal circuits for motivation. Neither behavioral nor neuroimaging data provided any evidence of altered motivation for social or monetary rewards in AUD. Exploratory whole-brain analyses only revealed stronger activation in the occipital/cuneal cortex in individuals with AUD than in healthy controls across all trials.

Though each ILC subset (ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s) is identified by specific transcription factors, cell surface receptors and cytokine profiles, functional plasticity between ILC subtypes occurs in various contexts. IL-18/IL-18R loci SNPs are linked to asthma in multiple genome-wide association studies andIL-18 has been shown to promote plasticity in ILC2s. Despite this, little is known about the in vivo role of IL-18/IL-18R on ILC2 responses in the lung. Within hours after mice were exposed to the fungal allergy Alternaria alternata, airway levels of IL-18 and IL-18 receptor expression increased on ST2+ ILCs. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung cells from Alternaria-challenged mice showed that Il18 was largely expressed by alveolar macrophages, while IL-18R was highly expressed in IL-13+ILC2s. Utilizing IL-18 receptor knock-out mice (IL-18R-/-), we observed increases in IL-17A production from both ST2+ and ST2-negative ILCs compared to control mice. We further observed an early increase in dual production of IL-5 and IL-17A in ST2+ ILCs followed by enhanced lung eosinophilia in the absence of IL-18R.

Remarkably, only mitotic slippage led to widespread nuclear abnormalities defined by highly variable nuclear deformations that we termed nuclear instability. These nuclei were softer and more vulnerable to microtubule-driven deformations leading to invaginations. Mechanistically, we found defects in chromatin compaction and H3K9me2 chromatin-lamina interactions. Moreover, transcriptional stability was disrupted as early as G1, with effects intensifying by G2. Importantly, we observed similar nuclear instability in megakaryocytes, which are physiological polyploid cells that we demonstrate here to be generated by mitotic slippage, providing a potential explanation for their atypical nuclear architecture. In striking contrast, nuclear shape was stable in different physiological polyploid cells generated by cytokinesis failure and endoreplication.

Marchantia polymorpha spores are single cell structures formed at meiosis. On germination, spores divide asymmetrically to form a basal cell that terminally differentiates and an apical germ cell that divides into an early cell mass on which a flat prothallus develops. A single stem cell niche (meristem) forms de novo at the margin of the prothallus to drive development of the thallus plant body. Here we show that the prothallus forms at the apical pole of the early cell mass and represses the formation of other prothalli. LOW AUXIN RESPONSIVE (MpLAXR) marks this apical pole indicating that an auxin minimum is located at the site of organogenesis. Light is required for the formation of the apical auxin minimum and for the development of the prothallus from the early cell mass. Disrupting the apical auxin minimum by exogenous auxin treatment suppresses the transitions to the prothallus and formation of the meristem from the early cell mass. A similar molecular program operates during plant regeneration from a single differentiated thallus cell, which regains stemness (pluripotency) upon surgical isolation from surrounding tissues; the isolated cell divides forming an early cell mass that develops a local auxin minimum where a flat prothallus with a single meristem forms.

Since pollinators remain inside the pollination chamber throughout anthesis in several species, it is believed that the aroma during the male phase does not attract pollinators and may even repel them. However, few studies have characterised the scents of Annonaceae species flowers during both the male and female phases, so this hypothesis has not been comprehensively evaluated. Here we characterise the reproductive ecology of Annona macroprophyllata, including individual- and flower-level phenology, mutualistic and non-pollinating interactions, and floral scent emissions. Our results showed that Annona macroprophyllata has receptive flowers at night, with the entire extent of reproductive activity restricted to an 8 hours-period. Female and male flowers are synchronous with differences in the proportion of flowers depending on the nighttime. Low diversity and abundance of floral visitors were observed. Four guilds were distinguished as pollinators, florivores, insect predators and random or non-specific visitors. Pollinators were insects (Nitulidae) that entered the pollination chamber during the female phase and remained inside the flower throughout anthesis. The comparison of floral scent diversity among flower phases showed that scent composition differs between the phases of A. macroprophyllata flowers. The scent of the female flower mimics the sweet smell of fruit, which usually attracts Nitulid beetles. In contrast, the fermented odors of the male phase seem to repel them, contributing to their release or ensuring that they visit only female flowers.

We compared the performance of RS-based predictors with traditional habitat descriptors in modelling the occurrence probabilities of 135 commonly recorded bird species. Models using Landsat reflectance outperformed those based on habitat data for predicting species occupancy (mean AUC = 0.68 vs 0.58) and achieved high predictive accuracy (AUC > 0.7) for more species (49 vs 20).

The secondary small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway promotes defense by silencing target genes in invading fungal and oomycete pathogens. Many secondary siRNAs derive from transcripts potentially encoding pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. Here, we report that siRNA production is an ancient function of an evolutionarily conserved clade of PPR genes that undergo extensive within-species diversification. In Arabidopsis thaliana, siRNA-source PPRs are physically clustered in one locus on Chromosome 1. These sequences are diversified through gene duplication followed by sequence diversification as well as accumulation of high-impact variations including pseudogenization. This diversity leads to the accumulation of a diverse PPR-siRNA pool, consistent with an engagement in a co-evolutionary arms race with the pathogens. This study defines siRNA-producing PPRs as a family of defense genes and highlights the potential of PPR-siRNA-based engineering for enhancing broad-spectrum disease resistance.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

However, when the subjective experience of an event diverges between observer and target, relying on AM may hinder empathic processes, rather than support them. In this study, we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data from 36 healthy young adults during a pain decision task to investigate empathy for individuals described as either sensitive to physical pain (like the participants) or clinically insensitive to physical pain. Participants reported lower empathy for insensitive than for sensitive targets, regardless of whether they had personally experienced the specific event that caused physical pain. Event-related potential (ERP) analyses revealed differences in neural responses to sensitive and insensitive targets at a late stage of processing, in the discending phase of the P300 component; these differences were positively correlated with individual differences in empathy. To determine the underlying mechanisms, we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to assess whether empathy for physical pain relies on AM reactivation or instead engages active perspective taking. We observed that AM reactivation can serve as a flexible mechanism that supports empathy by enabling observers to shift perspective when direct experiential overlap is lacking.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Resting-state fMRI studies in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have described connectivity alterations in large-scale brain networks. However, little is known about functional changes across disease stages, particularly in DLB. Objective. To investigate functional connectivity of key brain networks in DLB patients at different stages, compare them to AD and healthy controls (HC) and examine associations with core clinical symptoms. Methods: Ninety DLB patients, comprising 63 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI-DLB) and 27 with dementia (d-DLB), along with 25 AD patients (11 MCI-AD and 14 d-AD) and 34 HC underwent clinical, neuropsychological and resting-state fMRI assessment. ROI-to-ROI analyses were performed using the CONN toolbox, (pFDR<0.05). Results: The DLB group showed reduced functional connectivity within the salience network (SN) compared with HC, but did not differ from AD. While MCI-DLB patients showed no significant differences, d-DLB patients showed reduced SN and frontoparietal network (FPN) connectivity compared to HC and AD. SN connectivity was associated with severity of fluctuations and FPN connectivity with REM sleep behavior disorder and cognitive decline in DLB. In contrast, in the AD group, decreased default mode network (DMN) connectivity was associated with lower MMSE scores. Conclusion: SN and FPN connectivity impairments relate to disease progression and core clinical features in DLB, whereas DMN connectivity is linked to cognitive decline in AD. These distinct patterns highlight divergent paths of network dysfunction in the two diseases, offering insight into their underlying mechanisms and clinical expression.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

It was recently shown that MLIs consist of two subtypes, but the properties of PC synapses onto these subtypes was not known and it was assumed that all PC collateral to MLI synapses would provide positive feedback to PCs. Clarifying the PC connectivity onto MLI subtypes is vital to understating the influence of feedback from PC collaterals because MLI1s primarily inhibit PCs whereas MLI2s mainly inhibit MLI1s and disinhibit PCs. Here we use a combination of serial EM and optogenetic studies to characterize PC synapses onto MLI subtypes in mice. EM reconstructions show that PCs make 53% of their synapses onto other PCs, 32% onto PLIs, 6% onto MLI1s and 7% onto MLI2s. Since there are far more MLI1s than MLI2s, each MLI2 is expected to receive many more synapses than each MLI1. In slice experiments, optogenetic activation of PCs evokes inhibitory currents in most MLI2s, but primarily disinhibits MLI1s. We also find that candelabrum cells, a type of PLI, form many more synapses onto MLI1s than MLI2s. It is therefore expected that both PC-MLI2-MLI1-PC and PC-PLI-MLI1-PC pathways allow increased PC firing to disinhibit MLI1s, which are known to reduce dendritic PC calcium signals and suppress plasticity at granule cell to PC synapses. These pathways provide negative feedback that act in concert with PC-PC synapses to counter elevations in PC firing.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Loss-of-function mutations in the XPC gene lead to a photosensitive phenotype, with marked accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage and a dramatically elevated risk (10,000-fold) of skin cancer. However, understanding the molecular signaling mechanisms associated with XP-C has been hindered by the lack of reproducible disease models. Here, we overcome this challenge using our genetically engineered human XPC knockout (KO) keratinocytes, the predominant cell type affected by UV radiation. To uncover upstream signaling changes associated with the absence of XPC expression, we quantified protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity one-hour post-UVB exposure. XPC KO keratinocytes showed significant dysregulation of PTK activity on ~100 phosphosites compared to controls. Complementary mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomic analysis performed 24 hours post-UVB exposure identified a downstream signature comprising 791 differentially expressed proteins in XPC KO cells irradiated compared to non-irradiated counterparts. An integrative bioinformatic assessment of the kinase activity and proteomic data revealed a significant perturbation in type I interferon signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway in XPC-deficient keratinocytes, which is further exacerbated by UVB exposure. These findings were validated by western blot analysis, establishing a novel disease-associated molecular signature. Given the central role played by JAK/STAT signaling in inflammatory processes, our results implicate this pathway as a key mediator of XP-C hypersensitivity, thereby highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to alleviate the disease pathology.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Using genetic and genomic approaches, we found instead that canonical Wnts can cooperate with Bmps to enhance pSmad1/5 activity and initiate chondrogenic commitment in digit tip progenitors. 5'Hoxd mutant digits are characterized by elevated Bmp and pSmad1/5 activity and subsequent joint loss. We show that expressing stabilized beta-catenin (beta-catCA) in interdigit mesenchyme rescues 5'Hoxd mutant digit joint loss non-autonomously, by inducing secreted Wnt antagonists and normalizing digit tip pSmad1/5 levels. Indeed, genetic removal of Dkk2 in 5'Hoxd mutant prevented joint rescue by beta-catCA. Furthermore, elevating Wnt activity with Gsk3-beta antagonists in limb bud culture stabilized pSmad1/5 levels and enhanced Bmp activity. Elevated pSmad1/5, as seen in 5'Hoxd mutant, accelerates chondrogenic commitment, impeding a switch of phalanx forming region (PFR) cells in the digit tip to interzone (joint progenitor) fate. We propose that, before progenitors transit into PFR, Wnt antagonists cooperate with Fgfs to prevent precocious pSmad1/5 accumulation by stabilizing Gsk3-beta to promote Smad-linker phosphorylation and Smad1/5 degradation. Consequently, Wnt antagonists play a key role in modulating the pace of initial commitment of digit progenitors to chondrogenesis, together with Fgfs, and maintain mesenchymal plasticity to balance digit phalanx and joint formation.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

J.; Muranty, H.", "abstract": "This work introduces WISER (whitening and successive least squares estimation refinement), an innovative and efficient method designed to enhance phenotype estimation by addressing population structure. WISER outperforms traditional methods such as least squares (LS) means and best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) in phenotype estimation, offering a more accurate approach for omics-based selection and having the potential to improve association studies. Unlike existing approaches that correct for population structure, WISER provides a generalized framework applicable across diverse experimental setups, species, and omics datasets, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), metabolomics, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) used as phenomic predictors. Central to WISER is the concept of whitening, a statistical transformation that removes correlations between variables and standardizes their variances. Within its framework, WISER extends classical methods that use eigen-information as fixed-effect covariates to correct for population structure, by relaxing their assumptions and implementing a true whitening matrix instead of a pseudo-whitening matrix. This approach corrects fixed effects (e.g., environmental effects) for the genetic covariance structure embedded within the experimental design, thereby minimizing confounding factors between fixed and genetic effects. To support its practical application, a user-friendly R package named wiser has been developed. The WISER method has been employed in analyses for genomic prediction and heritability estimation across four species and 33 traits using multiple datasets, including rice, maize, apple, and Scots pine. Results indicate that genomic predictive abilities based on WISER-estimated phenotypes consistently outperform the LS-means and BLUP approaches for phenotype estimation, regardless of the predictive model applied. This underscores WISER's potential to advance omics analyses and related research fields by capturing stronger genetic signals.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a new class of models for high-dimensional molecular data that is guided by interventional auxiliary information to learn latent representations that are informative, interpretable-by-design and, as we show, allow for strong generalization to new data distributions and settings. Specifically, the proposed models use causal information from genetic loss-of-function screens to guide learning and thereby discover representations that are generally useful, even far beyond the original training context. Empirical results using cancer cell line datasets support the hypothesis that causal guidance permits strong generalization and we find that the models can be applied in an entirely \"zero-shot\" fashion--with no fine-tuning or adaptation whatsoever--to entire cancer types that were not encountered during training. Using several large patient cohorts, we show that this strong generalization applies also in the \"bench-to-bedside\" context of transferring cell line-based models to clinical data. Here, we find that our models, with all representation learning steps trained only on cell line data, can be efficiently transferred to patient data, hence opening up new ways to drive clinical modelling using tractable laboratory assays.

The transcription factor ETS1 was identified as a master regulator of the hEMT program, directly activating pro-metastatic genes and promoting distant spread in vivo. Unexpectedly, ETS1 also orchestrated an immune-cold tumor microenvironment by transcriptionally activating both STAT1 and PD-L1 (CD274) genes, suppressing T lymphocyte infiltration, and elevating immune checkpoint molecules. Clinically, ETS1-high tumors strongly correlated with poor survival and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade across multiple cohorts. Leveraging drug screens, we discovered that ETS1-high cancers are vulnerable to HSP90 inhibitors (e.g., Alvespimycin), which suppress ETS1 by disrupting HIF1A-mediated transcriptional activation. Together, our work reveals ETS1 as a dual driver of tumor distal metastasis and immune evasion in UASCC, while nominating HSP90 inhibition as a tailored treatment strategy for ETS1-driven tumors.

We conducted a meta analysis of tear proteomic datasets from human subjects undergoing photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and mice subjected to mechanical corneal abrasion. Differentially expressed proteins were identified and subjected to Reactome and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses to determine conserved and divergent biological responses. Approximately one third of the tear film proteomic response to corneal injury was conserved across species. Shared upregulated pathways included complement activation, actin cytoskeletal remodeling, protein synthesis, and acute inflammatory responses. Simultaneously, pathways related to adaptive immunity, proteolysis, and general metabolism were consistently downregulated. Human specific responses were enriched in secretory pathways, vesicle trafficking, and immune surveillance, whereas murine specific responses highlighted mitochondrial activation, oxidative metabolism, and stress adaptation. These distinctions reflect species dependent physiological strategies in managing epithelial repair. Our findings reveal a conserved molecular framework that governs corneal wound healing across species, with notable species specific adaptations. This cross species comparison underscores the translational relevance of tear film analysis and supports the development of targeted therapies tailored to human specific wound healing mechanisms in ocular surface disease.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

The pangenome captures 171,892 high-confidence SVs and enables genotyping of these SVs across 443 cucumber accessions, representing diverse geographic origins and spanning wild progenitors, landraces, and modern cultivars. Our analyses reveal that during cucumber domestication, a substantial portion of mildly deleterious SNPs are retained, whereas SVs are consistently purged, highlighting their potentially highly deleterious nature. During the geographic expansion of cucumber, a reduction in SV burden and a younger age of SVs than SNPs were observed, suggesting stronger purifying selection acting on SVs. Additionally, notable gene flow from wild population to African and European populations was detected, resulting in an increased SV burden, potentially due to hitchhiking effects. Importantly, incorporating SV burden into genomic prediction models improved the prediction accuracy for several agronomically important traits.

The first-in-class RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) inhibitor, CX-5461, has demonstrated promising activity in both haematological malignancies and solid tumours by selectively inhibiting ribosome biogenesis to induce nucleolar stress, a critical vulnerability in rapidly proliferating cancer cells. CX-5461 has undergone clinical trials for the treatment of both solid and haematological malignancies, and 2nd generation Pol I inhibitor PMR-116 has also entered clinical trials, underscoring the translational potential of drugs that target RNA Polymerase I. To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Pol I inhibition and prevent the emergence of resistance, we conducted a cell line-based unbiased screen of FDA-approved drugs to identify compounds that might synergise with CX-5461. This screen revealed that the pan-CDK inhibitors Dinaciclib and Flavopiridol enhance nucleolar stress pathway activation and are strong candidates for combinatorial therapy with CX-5461. Further analysis showed that the combination of CX-5461 and Dinaciclib acts synergistically across a genetically diverse panel of human AML cell lines. This synergy is dependent on an intact nucleolar surveillance pathway, with both agents independently activating NSP and stabilising p53, but with distinct phenotypic outcomes: Dinaciclib induces rapid apoptosis, whereas CX-5461 primarily enforces cell cycle arrest. This functional complementarity results in efficient tumour cell clearance and likely accounts for the delayed onset of therapy resistance. Combination treatment with CX-5461 and either CDK inhibitor significantly improved survival in murine models of AML and reduced colony formation in primary human AML samples. Together these findings provide preclinical evidence for a novel combination treatment strategy that leverages nucleolar stress and cell cycle control to enhance treatment outcomes in AML, paving the way for clinical translation of Pol I-CDK co-targeting therapies.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

We used time-lapse microscopy to perform single-cell level analyses of yeast populations with double-stranded DNA breaks and nonfunctional telomeres. Activation of the DNA damage signalling resulted in a broad distribution in the duration of G2/M arrests. Strikingly, the longer arrests correlated with aberrant mitoses caused by mis-coordination of nuclear division and cytokinesis, leading to cell death. Chk1-dependent phosphorylation of securin, an inhibitor of sister chromatid separation in mitosis, was responsible for this phenomenon. Securin progressively accumulated during G2/M arrests, leading to grossly delayed or missed nuclear divisions. This phenotype could be suppressed by slowing down the progression of mitotic exit via LTE1 deletion. Lowering securin levels also partially suppressed the DNA damage-induced aberrant mitoses but resulted in an increase in aneuploidy during normal growth. Our results demonstrate that in cells taking too long to complete DNA repair, the DNA damage checkpoint promotes aberrant mitoses and cell death, thereby eliminating cells with a higher chance of genomic instability.

The molecular mechanism of this membrane fusion step that occurs in all eukaryotes is unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanism by which two paralogous transmembrane proteins, Brl1 and Brr6, mediate membrane fusion in S. cerevisiae. Both proteins form multimeric, ring-shaped complexes with membrane remodeling activity. Brl1 is enriched at NPC assembly sites via a nuclear export sequence and then interacts with Brr6 across the nuclear envelope lumen through conserved hydrophobic loops. Disrupting this interaction blocks fusion and halts NPC assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the Brl1-Brr6 complex drives membrane fusion by forming a channel across bilayers that enables lipid exchange. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that Brl1/Brr6 homologues are broadly distributed across eukaryotes, and functional experiments in human cells and D. melanogaster establish CLCC1 as an NPC fusogen in metazoans.

In this study, we uncover a novel role for the C. elegans dynamin homolog, DYN-1, in regulating mitotic spindle pole assembly and the spatiotemporal localization of the key mitotic kinase Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1). Our studies demonstrate that the depletion of DYN-1 leads to enlarged metaphase spindle poles and elevated levels of centrosome-associated PLK-1. Strikingly, PLK-1 fails to re-localize from centrosomes to the midbody during late mitosis in a subset of DYN-1-depleted embryos, correlating with abnormal PLK-1 localization at the midbody and defective midbody formation. Importantly, this phenotype is likely not due to increased total PLK-1 protein levels, as DNM2 (human homolog of DYN-1) depletion in HeLa cells did not alter total Plk1 abundance.

We then compared these organoid cell type-specific gene expression profiles to a scRNA-seq atlas of the rabbit caecal epithelium in vivo. We selected the rabbit model notably because, unlike mice, it possesses BEST4 epithelial cells, a newly discovered subset of mature absorptive cells. Our analysis revealed a high degree of transcriptomic similarity between in vivo and organoid-derived stem and transit-amplifying cells. ALI culture markedly enhanced the differentiation of the secretory lineage, especially goblet cells, which transcriptome closely resembled that of in vivo goblet cells. Furthermore, ALI was the only condition allowing the detection of enteroendocrine cells. BEST4 cells, however, were absent from organoids in immerged or ALI conditions despite their presence in vivo. In addition, ALI culture led to a consistent downregulation of hypoxia and glycolysis-associated genes across all cell types, which suggests a metabolic shift likely driven by increased oxygen availability in ALI conditions. Cell-cell communication analyses further indicated that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling under ALI more closely mirrored in vivo patterns than under immerged condition.

Despite the availability of multiple cryopreservation methods, variations in the selection of developmental stage, cryoprotectant composition, and storage conditions may sometimes cause inconsistencies and uncertainty among researchers. In this study, we followed a step-by-step approach to optimize the C. elegans cryopreservation process. Firstly, different larval stages (L1-gravid adult) of C. elegans were cryopreserved using a fixed concentration of trehalose-DMSO and glycerol, followed by the post-thaw survival rate assessment. We found that the starved L1 larvae has the highest survival rate among other developmental stages. Subsequently, the starved L1 larvae was cryopreserved using different concentrations (5%, 10%, and 15%) of DMSO and glycerol and found that 5% DMSO has the most effective cryoprotection. Finally, the impact of storage conditions on worm viability was evaluated by placing cryogenic vials in different storage boxes, including standard cardboard cryogenic boxes, Styrofoam boxes, and isopropanol-based freezing containers, and found that standard cardboard cryogenic boxes provided higher worm viability. The finalized protocol was then validated across multiple mutant and transgenic strains to confirm its reproducibility and broad suitability. Taken together, our results demonstrate that starved L1 larvae cryopreserved with 5% DMSO using a standard cardboard cryogenic box provided the highest survival rate (>90%) across wild-type, mutant, and transgenic strains. Here we propose a simple, reproducible, and strain-independent protocol for cryopreservation of C. elegans. The proposed protocol can be easily adopted in C. elegans research laboratories and stock centers globally.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Despite scientific advances, vaccine and therapeutics pre-clinical development has yet to fully adopt human-relevant testing platforms due in part to a lack of validation. In this study, we characterised how static and dynamic flow culture conditions influence microphysiological systems (MPS) generated using primary bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. We assessed epithelial structure, functional differentiation, and infection dynamics. This study represents the first direct comparison of how dynamic flow and endothelial co-culture influence viral tropism, replication kinetics, and host responses across anatomically distinct regions of the respiratory tract in vitro. Dynamic flow promoted formation of more physiologically relevant tissue architecture, pseudostratified bronchial epithelium and alveolar sac-like structures, with enhanced epithelial differentiation and retention of region-specific cell phenotypes at the transcriptomic level. Both static and dynamic flow models demonstrated responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli (poly(I:C), LPS), producing distinct, tissue-specific cytokine profiles and supporting infection with multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Differences in infection efficiency, viral replication, and host gene expression were observed between variants, with dynamic flow models offering enhanced sensitivity and resolution. In alveolar tissues, dynamic flow increased infection efficiency and reduced variability, enabling more robust and consistent transcriptional responses. This facilitated the identification of interferon signalling pathways as key targets of the host response. Among the variants tested, Delta induced the most extensive tissue damage and strongest transcriptional response, whereas Omicron BA.5 exhibited greater infectivity in alveolar models compared to earlier variants. Our findings demonstrate that dynamic flow MPS more closely replicate human lung tissue architecture and cellular diversity, while also enhancing the predictive power and clinical relevance of airway models for ex vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These improvements strengthen the reliability of data generated for the study of host pathogen interaction studies and support the use of dynamic systems for evaluating novel anti-infectives, immunomodulators, and functional characterisation of immune sera generated by next-generation vaccines.

Increasing L6CT firing rates exerted a transition from inhibition to excitation across cortical layers. Furthermore, L6CT activity imparted population synchrony onto distinct cortical subpopulations, independent of changes in overall L6CT activity. In the thalamus, L6CT modulated thalamic burst in a bidirectional manner, dependent on L6CT stimulation frequency.

We show that salivary gland invasion is required but not sufficient for sporozoite optimal infectivity, with the acquisition of hepatocyte cell traversal and invasion progressively increasing until a plateau from 18 days post-infection onwards. Using a stage-specific fluorescent reporter as maturation marker, we correlated its high expression with time and infectivity for each compartment but only salivary gland sporozoites acquired maximal infectivity. Notably, our data suggest that salivated sporozoites, the natural transmission form, exhibit enhanced infectivity relative to gland-resident forms both in vitro and in vivo early after salivary gland invasion. This difference decreases following optimal maturation inside the glands over time.

E. faecium is also an opportunistic pathogen that causes multidrug resistant (MDR) infections. Bacteriophages (phages) have been proposed as therapeutics for the treatment of MDR infections, however, an obstacle for phage therapy is the emergence of phage resistance. Despite this, the development of phage resistance can impact bacterial fitness, thus, understanding the molecular basis of fitness costs associated with phage resistance can likely be leveraged as an antimicrobial strategy. We discovered that phage resistant E. faecium harbor mutations in the cell wall hydrolase gene sagA. SagA cleaves crosslinked peptidoglycan (PG) involved in PG remodeling. We show that mutations in sagA compromise E. faecium PG hydrolysis rendering them sensitive to {beta}-lactam antibiotics. sagA mutants have cell envelope integrity defects, increased cellular permeability, and aberrant distribution of penicillin binding proteins. This corresponds to a growth defect where cells have abnormal division septa, membrane blebbing, and the formation of mini cells. The dysregulation of the cell envelope in sagA mutants alters the binding of phages to the E. faecium cell surface. Our data support a model where phage infection of E. faecium requires phages to localize to sites of peptidoglycan remodeling at the cell poles and division septa. Our findings show that by altering the function of a single PG hydrolase, E. faecium loses intrinsic {beta}-lactam resistance.

Resistance is often conferred by genes that are transferred horizontally among species and strains. However, for many bacteria, little is known about the genetic variation that potentiates resistance gene acquisition and accommodates acquired genes in the coadapted recipient genome. Results: Here we introduce a new bioinformatics genome-wide association study approach with Guided Omission of Linkage Disequilibrium (GOLD-GWAS) that masks covarying alleles explained by coinheritance and genome proximity to reveal genes where covarying sequence likely represents functional linkage between loci, consistent with epistasis. Analysing 806 Staphylococcus aureus isolate genomes, including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains, we identify genes that covary with the presence of the acquired staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) that houses the mecA resistance gene. Conclusions: Uncovering known and new gene-gene associations, we demonstrate how resistance can involve genetic coalitions beyond the well-known AMR genes. Understanding how genome change, here extrinsic resistance cassettes, are integrated within coadapted bacterial genomes is an important step towards mitigating AMR evolution by identifying novel genetic targets for risk prediction, diagnosis and therapy.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Although this parasite lacks canonical transcriptional control, epigenetic regulation plays a pivotal role in modulating gene expression. Bromodomain-containing factors (BDFs), known for recognizing acetylated lysines on histones, have emerged as key regulators of chromatin structure and gene activity. Among the eight predicted BDFs in T. cruzi, TcBDF6 is part of a TINTIN-like complex with TcMRGx and TcMRGBP, homologous to components of the NuA4/TIP60 chromatin remodeling complex. To investigate the function of TcBDF6, we generated knockout (KO) parasites using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. While BDF6-deficient epimastigotes did not exhibit very significative growth differences, the resulting metacyclic trypomastigotes displayed drastically reduced infectivity. Strikingly, once inside host cells, TcBDF6 deficient parasites differentiated into amastigotes but failed to replicate. This intracellular arrest was partially reversed by episomal re-expression of TcBDF6. Consistently, BDF6 KO parasites also exhibited impaired infectivity, a defect that was also rescued in the add-back line. Our findings highlight TcBDF6 as a critical regulator of intracellular parasite development, operating in stages beyond epimastigotes where epigenetic plasticity is essential for host adaptation. The unique, stage-specific phenotype of BDF6 knockouts underscores its functional importance and suggests that bromodomains may represent novel therapeutic targets against T. cruzi.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Development of a safe and efficacious pan-Dengue vaccine has been complicated by the potential of antibody-dependent enhancement, in which cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies can enhance infection and pathology. We previously demonstrated that a mRNA-LNP that encodes for the DENV-1 prM and Envelope proteins generates homotypic neutralizing immune responses and protects against a lethal challenge. The DENV-1 vaccine avoided ADE by 3-point mutations, G106R, L107D, and F108A, to the fusion loop (FL), one of the dominant ADE epitopes. Using a similar design methodology, here we present mRNA-LNP chimeric prM-E vaccines for DENV 2, 3, and 4. These vaccines maintained the {Delta} FL modifications, but encode a chimeric E protein with Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) stem/transmembrane (st/tm) to improve VLP expression and stability. All three vaccines elicited neutralizing titers of serotype specific antibodies in immunocompetent C57/BL6 mice and are protected against a lethal homotypic DENV challenge in susceptible mice.

Telomere uncapping poses a profound threat to genome integrity, yet the immediate consequences of transient uncapping remain unclear. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 complex caps telomeres and limits resection, which would otherwise lead to DNA damage checkpoint activation. Here, using the temperature-sensitive cdc13-1 allele, we demonstrate that even transient telomere uncapping induces extensive genomic rearrangements within a few cell cycles, despite a functional DNA damage checkpoint. Two distinct rearrangement signatures were observed in cells surviving transient uncapping: one characterized by the reorganization and recombination of the subtelomeric region, mostly involving the Y' elements, and the other exhibiting massively elongated telomeres up to 10 kb, corresponding to a ~30-fold increase. Long-read sequencing revealed that the genomic instability was confined to the subtelomere and telomere regions, and evidenced Y' element loss/amplification, terminal duplication of chromosome ends, and telomeric-circle-driven amplification of telomere repeats. Rearrangements unfold over multiple generations and require the homologous recombination factor Rad52 and the Pol{delta} subunit Pol32, which is essential for break-induced replication. The recombination proteins Rad51 and Rad59 also contribute to the rearrangements in partially independent pathways. Remarkably, survivors with elongated telomeres demonstrate robust resistance to subsequent telomere uncapping, in a Rad52-dependent manner.

In this study, we tested the regulatory response of Solanum pennellii genotypes exhibiting different lag-phase durations. We conducted a time-series gene expression profiling experiment dissecting genotype-specific regulatory responses to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum inoculation. We observed genotype-specific regulatory trajectories, with resistant plants displaying early activation of defence-related genes during the asymptomatic phase.

Given the potential toxicities associated with castor beans, we have used a metabolic flux-engineering approach to produce {gamma}-decalactone from oleic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Intracellular conversion of oleic acid to ricinoleic acid was achieved by the expression of oleate hydroxylase Fah12 from ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-mediated glycerol synthesis was identified as the major metabolic diversion of oleic acid that negatively impacts {gamma}-decalactone yields. Chemogenomic profiling analysis revealed that the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway provides resistance to {gamma}-decalactone-mediated toxicity in yeast. Overexpression of tryptophan transporter Tat1 enhanced {gamma}-decalactone production by about 3-fold.

In this study we developed a mouse model of pediatric malnutrition and intestinal colonization with clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CR-Kp). Juvenile mice fed a protein-deficient diet (PD) were more susceptible to intestinal colonization after inoculation with human-derived strains of CR-Kp, demonstrating a 3-4 log higher colonization burden in comparison to mice fed a control diet (CD). Colonization in PD-fed mice persisted for up to 6 weeks and CR-Kp were transmitted between PD-fed but not CD-fed cage mates. Antibiotic treatment resulted in similar CR-Kp colonization burdens regardless of diet, suggesting that nutrition-dependent colonization resistance is reliant on an intact microbiota. Secondary bile acids, a product of resident intestinal microbiota, were reduced in PD-fed and antibiotic treated mice and demonstrated an inverse correlation with CR-Kp burden. Secondary bile acids directly inhibited CR-Kp growth in vitro, suggesting that a loss of these inhibitory metabolites may mediate malnutrition-induced susceptibility to HRE colonization.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

These genetic elements drive horizontal gene transfer and play a fundamental role in bacterial ecology and evolution. Theory suggests that plasmids might evolve faster than chromosomes, as the mutation rate per gene should proportionally increase with plasmid copy number. However, the segregation of plasmid copies to daughter cells is random, introducing an additional layer of genetic drift, known as segregational drift, that might delay plasmid evolution. The interplay between plasmid mutational supply and segregational drift determines the evolutionary rate of plasmid-encoded genes, yet the relative contribution of these opposite forces in plasmid evolution remains unclear. Here, we took a classical population genetics framework to devise a mathematical approximation that predicts the fate of plasmid mutations in bacterial populations. We then validate these predictions by integrating computational, experimental, and bioinformatic approaches. Our findings show that plasmid mutation rates scale logarithmically with copy number: while increasing copy number elevates the mutation rate, the effect diminishes at higher copy numbers, where additional copies yield only marginal increases. Nonetheless, the supply of new mutations consistently surpasses the impact of segregational drift across all copy number levels.

This study explores the reproductive mechanism driving the surge in rat population triggered by the fruiting of the bamboo species, Melocanna baccifera. We examined four key reproductive parameters, viz., mounting frequency, serum nitric oxide (NO), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), in mice and rats under M. baccifera fruit- or its amino acid (AA)-fed conditions. 2. The mounting frequency of M. baccifera fruit liquid administered male mice was 5.50, compared to 2.00 of control animals. NO level in M. baccifera fruit liquid-fed mice displayed an increase of 131.83%. The pregnancy and pups number in Muli fruit-fed female animals enhanced by 66.66% and 131.25%, respectively. The average pups production in Muli fruit-, dAA (d-Thr-Ser-Glu-Phe-His-Ala)-fed and control female rats were 7.40, 8.80, and 5.34 (pups/animal), respectively.

The increased mounting frequency, along with elevated levels of serum NO, FSH, and LH, in animals consuming M. baccifera fruits or the AA mix, strongly indicates enhanced reproductive activity.

CMS has been recently discovered in animals, in the freshwater snail Physa acuta. In this species, CMS is associated with two extremely divergent mitogenomes D and K compared to the classical mitogenome N. D individuals are male-steriles, while male fertility is restored in K individuals. We hypothesized that the extreme divergence of mitogenomes associated with CMS can impact mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, a necessary process in eukaryotic organisms by which energy is transduced from food to ATP. We show that CMS is associated with an alteration of co-encoded complex I in D male-sterile individuals, although partly compensated by the nuclear-encoded complex II. K restored hermaphrodites have an unaffected complex I respiration, but exhibit lower mitochondrial efficiency and higher anaerobic contribution to cellular metabolism, highlighting an energy cost of bearing CMS and restorer genes, which likely underlie the reduced growth of K mitotype.

Leaf folding occurs with a response timing and intensity that varies depending on the stimulus. This adaptive behavior may function as a defense mechanism, helping plant resist herbivores and environmental stressors. However, the molecular and genetic mechanisms that are involved in leaf folding are still not totally understood. In this study, the gene regulatory networks underlying M. pudica leaf closure following single and multiple mechanical disturbances (whole pot drops) were investigated. Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured as fast phenotypic indicator of transient or permanent photochemical damage, and transcriptional responses were measured to identify the key genes regulating phenotypic changes after single or multiple drops. A progressive reduction of the quantum yield of photosystem 2 revealed a lower electron transport rate in leaves subjected to one or more drops, which may indicate the onset of energy shortage, perhaps caused by low ATP availability, limiting both leaf movement and photosynthesis. The transcriptomic profiles revealed larger differences when plants were subjected to multiple drops than to a single drop, with respect to unstressed controls. Interestingly, following a single drop, the majority of up-regulated genes were associated with the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. After multiple drops, however, genes associated with biotic and abiotic stress resistance pathways were predominantly up-regulated. These results provide a basis for developing a gene regulatory network model of stress-induced movements in M. pudica leaves, which may help design sustainable strategies of plant stress defense.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used the root apex of Solanum lycopersicum as a model system to explore how increasing copper concentrations affect organelle integrity, stress signaling, and nuclear architecture. Using confocal and super-resolution imaging with organelle-specific markers and immunostaining, we observed that mitochondria was the earliest affected to Cu stress, exhibiting fragmentation, membrane depolarization, and cytochrome c release led to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, activation of AMPK, suppression of mTOR signaling, and nuclear translocation of NRF2. Critically, we found that copper exposure induced profound nuclear alterations, including shrinkage, lobulation, peripheral chromatin tethering, and global condensation events tightly correlated with stress signaling. H3K4me3 immunostaining revealed a shift from active euchromatin to condensed, transcriptionally silent states, leading to membrane rupture and cell death in root tip cells.

Using a prototypic influenza HA stem immunogen lacking effective CD4+ T cell help in BL6 mice, we interrogated the minimal requirements for T cell help needed to drive serological responses to vaccination. We find that priming of naive CD4 T cells is markedly efficient, however the immunodominance of a given CD4 T cell epitope is not predictive of the propensity to provide high quality help to antigen-specific B cells. In the context of soluble antigens, provision of a single MHC class II epitope is sufficient to drive robust germinal centre responses and serum IgG titres. However not all CD4 epitopes provide equivalent levels of B cell help, despite priming comparable numbers of antigen-specific CD4 T cells. Finally, we show multimerizing and arraying antigens on nanoparticle scaffolds unlocks highly subdominant, near-undetectable CD4 T cell helper responses to support a T-dependent antibody response.

Mitochondria are critical for energy production and cellular adaptation to stress. We previously reported reduced trophoblast mitochondrial respiration in GDM. Here we examine changes in mitochondrial structure dynamics, quality and protein homeostasis as well as clearance in both obese and GDM placentas of male and female fetuses. As obesity significantly increases the risk for GDM, our goal is to determine the distinct effects of each on placental mitochondria. Methods: We collected placental villous tissue following elective cesarean section at term from lean (LN, pre-pregnancy BMI 18.5-24.9), obese (OB, BMI>30) or obese with type A2 GDM women. Expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, structure dynamics, quality control and clearance were assessed by Western blotting. Significant changes between groups were determined in fetal sex-dependent and independent manner. Results: Only placentas from obese women showed increase in proteins regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1 and SIRT1). We report fetal sex-specific changes in mitochondrial fusion but an overall decline in fission in OB and GDM placentas. Both maternal obesity and GDM affected proteins involved in maintaining mitochondrial protein quality and genome stability. This was accompanied by a reduction in mitochondrial complexes, suggesting impaired mitochondrial function. Obesity led to partial activation of mitophagy pathways (e.g., increased PINK1 without PARKIN activation), GDM placentas failed to mount this response.

Thus, a commercially available C57BL/6N mouse model in which the Ttc22 exon 2&3 encoding the TPR4 (equal to the human TTC22 TPR3) domain was knocked out via CRISPR-Cas9 was used to evaluate the contribution of Ttc22 to the development of mice and COAD. Unfortunately, the long-term observation results demonstrated that Ttc22 knockout (KO, including Ttc22-/+ or Ttc22-/-) did not affect the body weight, development, fertility, or spontaneous tumor incidence of male or female mice. No differences in the incidence of AOM/DSS-induced COAD were observed between these mouse groups, although Ttc22 exon 2&3 deletion partially resulted in the upregulation of adaptive response genes in the colon mucosa. Further study revealed that TPR4 deletion did not disrupt the effect of TTC22 on WTAP upregulation. Consistently, TPR4 deletion did not affect the abundance of total RNA m6A in the colon tissues of the mice, suggesting that the TPR4-deleted Ttc22 mutant remains functional.

Although CFTR modulators have transformed care, ~10% of people with CF remain without effective therapy. Durable, mutation-agnostic approaches are urgently needed. Method: We used a lentiviral (LV) vector to deliver wild-type CFTR to airway basal cells derived from 13 paediatric CF participants with a range of genotypes. Transduced cells were assessed for transgene expression, epithelial differentiation, and CFTR function using air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Separately, to evaluate regenerative capacity in vivo, LVGFP-transduced rabbit airway basal cells were transplanted into the denuded nasal septum of healthy New Zealand white rabbits using a biocompatible scaffold. Results: Transduced basal cells retained multilineage differentiation capacity, forming well-organized, pseudostratified epithelium with intact barrier function and ciliary activity. CFTR channel activity was restored to levels comparable to or exceeding those achieved with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), including in individuals with nonsense mutations. Combined CFTR transduction plus ETI treatment showed additive benefit. In vivo, transplanted rabbit basal cells engrafted and differentiated to regenerate a mucociliary epithelium, with improved nasal potential difference and mucociliary clearance compared to scaffold-only controls.

Mutations in RECQL4 are linked to severe human diseases, including Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome, RAPIDALINO Syndrome, and Baller-Gerold Syndrome. However, we still do not fully understand its functions and genetic interactions. The role of the ATP-dependent helicase activity in RECQL4 remains controversial. To understand RECQL4s functions further, we conducted a genome-wide forward genetic screen using murine models that closely mimic the RECQL4 mutations found in patients with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. Our goal was to identify loss-of-function alleles that could rescue the proliferation and viability defects associated with RECQL4 mutation. From our screening we identified the loss of KLHDC3, a substrate-binding subunit of the Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) E3, as the most significant rescue allele. KLHDC3 facilitates the ubiquitin-mediated destruction of proteins with specific C-terminal degron motifs. Its loss normalized cell proliferation and DNA replication rates in cells with mutated RECQL4. Further analysis revealed that the loss of KLHDC3 led to the stabilization of minute levels of a truncated RECQL4 protein. This RECQL4 fragment contained a neo-degron sequence specific for KLHDC3, formed after Cre-mediated recombination of the Recql4fl allele. Although this rescue mechanism does not apply to human RECQL4 mutations, it shows that very low chromatin-bound levels of a truncated RECQL4 protein, comprising only the N-terminal 480 amino acids, including its Sld2-like domain but lacking the ATP-dependent helicase domain and the entire C-terminal portion, are sufficient to support DNA replication in mammalian cells. These results demonstrate that the ATPase activity and helicase domain of RECQL4 are not essential for DNA replication in mammals. Furthermore, our findings suggest that there are unlikely to be monogenic loss-of-function alleles that can rescue RECQL4 mutations. This demonstrates that RECQL4 is an essential and non-redundant regulator of DNA replication and cell viability and that this activity does not require the ATP dependent helicase activity.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we use the ROCK2 specific inhibitor, GV101, in the context of breast cancer (BC) models to uncouple the effects of ROCK2 pharmacological inhibition on both epithelial and stromal fibroblast cell populations. We demonstrate that ROCK2 inhibition with GV101 reduces fibroblast-mediated remodelling of pre-existing and de novo synthesised ECM resulting in a reduction in biomechanical stiffness, while also limiting epithelial cell growth in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that ROCK2 inhibition exposes epithelial cell vulnerability to fluid flow-induced shear stress. Furthermore, using 3D co-cultures we reveal that GV101 reduces single-cell migratory capacity, while the disruption of stromal ECM architecture is sufficient to impede collective cell migration and invasion. Finally, we assessed ROCK2 expression in human BC patient tumours revealing that ROCK2 expression is up-regulated during BC progression and that high ROCK2 expression correlates with poor patient outcome in the triple-negative subtype of BC. Together, these results demonstrate that ROCK2 specific inhibition disrupts key functions in both epithelial cell and stromal fibroblast compartments warranting further assessment of ROCK2 in highly proliferative, fibrotic or metastatic diseases, such as BC.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

Another potential route to these endpoints is transplantation of novel steroidogenic tissue. To develop a pre-clinical model, we asked whether different-sex gonad transplants can be functionally integrated into the adult mouse hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Adult male and female mice were gonadectomized and implanted with gonads from genetically matched but different-sex pups. Controls received gonads from same-sex pups. Temporal changes to gonadotropin and steroid hormone levels reveal the decoupling of the HPG following gonadectomy and gonad-dependent levels after transplanting donor gonads. After six weeks, histological structures in transplanted gonads were consistent with expected steroidogenesis and gametogenesis. Interestingly, pituitary, ARC and AVPV mRNA showed gonad- and sex-dependent expression patterns. Future work with this technique could lead to translation to gender affirming care and explorations of gonad-dependent sex differences in biomedical and basic research.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

J.; Abdelaziz, M.; Clo, J.", "abstract": "Polyploidy has been associated in theoretical works with better adaptive potential, even though it is related to higher selfing rates. Self-fertilization causes an increase in homozygosity and has been related to weaker evolvability. However, there is a lack of empirical studies about the joint effects of polyploidy and selfing on genetic variance. We studied genetic variance in Erysimum incanum, a Brassicaceae selfing species from the Western Mediterranean basin with three different ploidy levels. We measured a series of phenotypic traits in individuals of each ploidy, obtained by controlled crosses and grown in different climatic conditions. For comparison, we also conducted mathematical simulations to explore how genetic diversity could be affected by the ploidy level and mating system. While theoretical approaches showed a positive relationship between ploidy and genetic variance and inbreeding depression, empirical results show lower evolvability and transgressive segregation for polyploids, related also to environmental conditions. Genetic variance in E. incanum polyploids could be related with recent establishment and adaptation to harsh environments, which explains the apparent contradiction with theory, where more settled and established populations are considered.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

J.; Ordonez, M.; Allison, S. D.; Homyak, P. M.; Wilkins, M. J.; Glassman, S. I.", "abstract": "Wildfires significantly alter soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), reducing microbial richness and biomass, while selecting for fire-loving pyrophilous microbes that drive post-fire nutrient cycling. However, the genomic strategies and functional trade-offs (balancing gains in one trait with costs in another) underlying the traits that enable pyrophilous microbes to survive and thrive post-fire are virtually unknown. We hypothesized that pyrophilous fungi employ specialized genomic adaptations for C and N cycling, with evolutionary trade-offs between traits governing aromatic C degradation, N acquisition pathways, and rapid growth. To test these hypotheses, we assessed hyphal extension rates and constructed a comparative genomics framework for 18 pyrophilous fungi from five Ascomycota (Eurotiales, Pleosporales, Sordariales, Coniochaetales, and Pezizales) and three Basidiomycota (Agaricales, Holtermaniales, and Geminibasidiales) orders isolated from burned soils. We found a dramatic trait trade-off between fast growth and number of genes responsible for aromatic C degradation, implying that these metabolically costly genes are selected for in burned environments despite their evolutionary cost. We used the comparative genomics framework to evaluate the genomic signatures of evolution and found that either gene duplication and somatic mutation, or recombination via sexual reproduction, were the primary drivers of fungal genomic variation in aromatic C degradation and N acquisition genes. Finally, we identified rare cross-kingdom bacterial to fungal horizontal gene transfer as a third strategy producing novel aromatic C degradation genes. Overall, we found that trait trade-offs and genome evolutionary strategies are key drivers of the rapid colonization and persistence of pyrophilous fungi in post-fire ecosystems.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

P.; Contreras-Moreira, B.", "abstract": "The genomic and evolutionary study of allopolyploid organisms involves multiple copies of homeologous chromosomes, making their assembly, annotation, and phylogenetic analysis challenging. Bioinformatics tools and protocols have been developed to study polyploid genomes, but sometimes require the assembly of their genomes, or at least the genes, limiting their use. We have developed AlloSHP, a command-line tool for detecting and extracting single homeologous polymorphisms (SHPs) from the subgenomes of allopolyploid species. This tool integrates three main algorithms, WGA, VCF2ALIGNMENT and VCF2SYNTENY, and allows the detection SHPs for the study of diploid-polyploid complexes with available diploid progenitor genomes, without assembling and annotating the genomes of the allopolyploids under study. AlloSHP has been validated on three diploid-polyploid plant complexes, Brachypodium, Brassica, and Triticum-Aegilops, and a set of synthetic hybrid yeasts and their progenitors of the genus Saccharomyces. The results and congruent phylogenies obtained from the four datasets demonstrate the potential of AlloSHP for the evolutionary analysis of allopolyploids with a wide range of ploidy and genome sizes. AlloSHP combines the strategies of simultaneous mapping against multiple reference genomes and syntenic alignment of these genomes to call SHPs, using as input data a single VCF file and the reference genomes of the known or closest extant diploid progenitor species. This novel approach provides a valuable tool for the evolutionary study of allopolyploid species, both at the interspecific and intraspecific levels, allowing the simultaneous analysis of a large number of accessions and avoiding the complex process of assembling polyploid genomes.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

While immunoassays provide ensemble-level details on anti-A{beta} ; drug interactions with protein targets, their interfacial effects are largely unknown at a single-particle level. Here, we profile untreated and aducanumab-treated A{beta}-42 protein aggregates from oligomers to fibrils using atomic force microscopy coupled with infrared spectroscopy (nanospectroscopy). Based on the recorded morphological and secondary structure details of aducanumab-treated A{beta}-42 aggregates using nanospectroscopy, we observed a reduction in oligomer prevalence and formation of larger diameter fibril bundles compared to identically prepared untreated-A{beta}-42 peptides. Conversely, controls based on lecanemab did not reveal any quenching of the A{beta}-42 oligomer generation. Moreover, lecanemab was evidenced to bind along the full length of the A{beta}-42 protofibril surface preferentially. Importantly, the structure of A{beta}-42 fibrils did not disassemble in both studies upon the adsorption of aducanumab and lecanemab. Additional experiments were also conducted, such as aggregation kinetic assays and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on aducanumab and lecanemab-treated A{beta}-42 protein aggregates that corroborated the findings from nanospectroscopy studies. Our work highlights the usefulness of nanospectroscopy in studying elemental anti-amyloid antibody interactions with protein biomarkers, a requisite for improving Alzheimer's disease-modifying treatments.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}

We identified a novel role for the endogenous oxylipin 9S-HODE, secreted by lean adipocytes, to induce ferroptosis in breast cancer cells while sparing normal breast epithelial cells. Obese adipocytes fail to secrete 9S-HODE, suggesting that the loss of ferroptosis induction significantly contributes to the acceleration of obesity-associated breast cancer. Consequently, the inhibition of ferroptosis accelerates breast cancer in lean, but not obese, mice. Further, 9S-HODE inhibits the growth of patient-derived breast cancer organoids, and supplementing 9S-HODE into tumors in obese mice is sufficient to reduce tumor burden, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic agent.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": ""}
