This study explores how the brains of amniotes diverged in their neuronal composition. The systematic analysis of a large dataset on the cellular composition of the major parts of the brain of 242 amniote species shows that it is not the case that a general theme in amniote evolution is the proportional expansion of the telencephalon or pallium, for such expansion only happened in owls, in primates, and in the largest mammalian species. Instead, the brains of extant mammalian, avian, and reptile species are characterized by signature proportions of numbers of neurons across the brain divisions. Reptile brains, with few exceptions, are characterized by having fewer than 10 million neurons in each brain division, with about 1.5 neurons in the telencephalon and 0.5 neuron in the cerebellum to every neuron in the rest of brain. In contrast, the brains of the closely related birds are characterized by much larger numbers of neurons that occur at a higher, fixed proportion of 4.5 neurons in the cerebellum to every neuron in the rest of brain, with variable ratios of pallial neurons. The brains of mammalian species, in turn, are characterized by larger numbers of neurons that occur at an average 4 neurons in the cerebellum to every neuron in the pallium regardless of numbers of neurons in the rest of brain. There is a striking continuity in the scaling of the pallium (or telencephalon) of extant mammalian and squamate brains that argues for a quantitative continuum between the two groups and dispels the mistaken notion that mammalian brains evolved with a qualitative change or an addition of structures to the reptilian brain. The shared scaling rules between mammalian and squamate brain structures also allow for predicting the composition of early synapsid brains in amniote evolution.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Identifying accurate representation of functional neuroanatomy substrates of mental processing could inform understanding of its neural mechanism. The challenge is that it is unclear whether a specific mental process possesses a 'functional neuroanatomy fingerprint', i.e., a unique and reliable pattern of functional neuroanatomy that underlies the mental process. To address this question, we utilized a multi-task deep learning model to disentangle the functional neuroanatomy fingerprint of seven different and representative mental processes including Emotion, Gambling, Language, Motor, Relational, Social, and Working Memory. Results based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of two independent cohorts of 1235 subjects from the US and China consistently show that each of the seven mental processes possessed a functional neuroanatomy fingerprint, which is represented by a unique set of functional activity weights of whole-brain regions characterizing the degree of each region involved in the mental process. The functional neuroanatomy fingerprint of a specific mental process exhibits high discrimination ability (93% classification accuracy and AUC of 0.99) with those of the other mental processes, and is robust across different datasets and using different brain atlases. This study provides a solid functional neuroanatomy foundation for investigating the neural mechanism of mental processing.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

We employed a network construction approach to identify hub genes from GEARs, and utilized them for cancer classification. In the case of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the GEARs were found to be related to mitosis. Our analysis suggested that LUAD cell lines carrying PIK3CA mutations exhibit increased drug resistance. For breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), the GEARs were related to immunity. Further analysis revealed that CDH1 mutation might regulate immune infiltration through the EMT process. Moreover, we explored the prognostic relevance of mitosis and immunity through their respective scores and demonstrated it as valuable biomarkers for predicting patient prognosis. In summary, our study offered significant biological insights into GEARs and highlights their potentials as robust prognostic indicators across diverse cancer types.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

To better understand the potential reasons for many trait-associated loci lacking eQTL colocalization, we investigated whether chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) explain immune-mediated disease associations that eQTLs in LCLs did not. The power to detect caQTLs was greater than that of eQTLs and was less affected by the distance from the transcription start site of the associated gene. Meta-analyzing LCL eQTL data to increase the sample size to over a thousand led to additional loci with eQTL colocalization, demonstrating that insufficient statistical power is still likely to be a factor. Moreover, further eQTL colocalization loci were uncovered by surveying eQTLs of other immune cell types. Altogether, insufficient power and context-specificity of eQTLs both contribute to the 'missing regulation.'", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

We quantify diet overlap and fit geostatistical mixed models to evaluate effects of local-scale covariates on stomach contents. The dietary overlap is low and does not decline with predator density. We find that cod feed less on the isopod Saduria entomon at high flounder densities. However, the total prey weight in cod is not affected by flounder densities. This suggests that interspecific food competition is not limiting the overall feeding of cod, but affects its diet composition.

V.; Thanbichler, M.", "abstract": "Bactofilins are a widespread family of cytoskeletal proteins with important roles in bacterial morpho-genesis, chromosome organization and motility. They polymerize in a nucleotide-independent manner, forming non-polar filaments that are typically associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. Membrane binding was suggested to be mediated by a short N-terminal peptide, but the underlying mechanism and the conservation of this interaction determinant among bacteria remain unclear. Here, we use the bacto-filin homolog BacA of the stalked bacterium Caulobacter crescentus as a model to analyze the membrane-binding behavior of bactofilins. Based on site-directed mutagenesis of the N-terminal region, we identify the full membrane-targeting sequence of BacA (MFSKQAKS) and pinpoint amino acid residues that are critical for its function in vivo and in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulations then provide detailed insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the membrane affinity of this peptide. Collectively, these analyses reveal a delicate interplay between the water exclusion of hydrophobic N-terminal residues, the arrangement of the peptide within the membrane and the electrostatic attraction between positively charged groups in the peptide and negative charges in the phospholipid molecules. A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis shows that the composition and properties of the membrane-targeting sequence of BacA are conserved in numerous bactofilin homologs from diverse bacterial phyla. Importantly, our findings reveal cooperative effects between the membrane-binding and polymerization activities of BacA. Moreover, they demonstrate that both of these activities critically contribute to the recruitment of the BacA client protein PbpC, a membrane-bound cell wall synthase that uses a conserved peptide in its N-terminal cytoplasmic tail to interact with BacA assemblies. Finally, we show that PbpC can functionally replace the endogenous membrane-targeting sequence of BacA when provided at elevated levels in trans, indicating that client proteins can make a significant contribution to the membrane association of bactofilin polymers. Together, these results unravel the mechanistic underpinnings of membrane binding by bactofilin homologs, thereby illuminating a previously obscure but important aspect in the biology of this cytoskeletal protein family.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

The Alpine ibex faced near-extinction two centuries ago, resulting in exceptionally low genome-wide diversity and increased inbreeding, which facilitated the purging of severe deleterious mutation load. For this, we produced a highly contiguous chromosome-level genome assembly of the Alpine ibex capturing structural divergence from domestic goat (Capra hircus) and mapping immune-relevant MHC genes. Analyses of eight recent ibex-goat hybrids from two swarms in Northern Italy, combined with 29 non-hybrid Alpine ibex and 22 domestic goats, identified 215 masked loss-of-function (LOF) mutations introduced via hybridization. Yet, we found no evidence for counter-selection in early backcrosses. This exposes Alpine ibex to further backcrosses compounding the deleterious mutation load of the species by a factor of up to two.

Further, we show how mean and variance have mutual negative feedbacks on each other mediated by high disease-induced death rates at high loads. Helpfully, we find that mean and variance provide information into underlying processes as well. Population-level trends in the mean and variance reveal underlying trends in within-host processes, e.g., differentiating host evolution of defence that manifests as tolerance, constitutive resistance, inducible resistance, or acquired resistance. Such inference may be critical for managing endangered Mountain Yellow Legged Frog populations recovering from Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis epidemics.

We report that the histone reader YEATS2 is responsible for increased invasive potential in head and neck cancer in an SP1-dependent manner. YEATS2 functions by maintaining histone crotonylation, and its abrogation leads to a global decrease in the H3K27cr mark. Mechanistically, we report that YEATS2 maintains high promoter H3K27cr levels by assisting in the recruitment of crotonyltransferase p300 at the promoter of the EMT-promoting gene SPARC.

We hypothesized that phosphorylation of E2F4 disrupts its protective function, whereas E2F4DN retains this activity during cellular stress. To test this hypothesis, we treated N2a-derived neurons with camptothecin (CPT) to induce genotoxic stress.

E2F1, used as a pro-apoptotic control, strongly induced caspase-3 activation. This effect was partially mimicked by E2F4CA, whereas E2F4DN markedly suppressed caspase-3 cleavage. Notably, E2F4DN but not E2F4CA upregulated the antiapoptotic factor Cited2, and Cited2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of E2F4DN.

Using ultra-high field (7-Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the resting-state effective connectivity of three basal forebrain subregions, the medial septum/diagonal band (Ch1-3), nucleus basalis of Meynert (Ch4), and the ventral pallidum, with core regions of the salience network and DMN. This was investigated in a transdiagnostic sample of 70 individuals with mental health conditions, predominantly depressive and anxiety disorders, and 77 healthy controls.

Despite the advances in the study of TII-mediated anti-tumour activity, the impact of TII on the orchestration of phagocytosis in the tumour setting requires further elucidation. Here, we investigated whether macrophage phagocytosis of tumour cells can be modulated through induction of TII. To this end, mice were pre-treated with {beta}-glucan, a fungal-derived agonist of TII, and bone marrow was isolated for macrophage differentiation. Macrophages were then co-cultured with tumour cells that were either apoptotic or opsonised with an antibody recognising a tumour antigen, to mimic efferocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), respectively. While TII did not have any impact in the modulation of ADCP, efferocytosis was decreased in trained macrophages. Along the same line, gene expression analysis demonstrated that mRNA levels of molecules promoting efferocytosis were downregulated in trained macrophages. Trained macrophages exerted decreased levels of active caspase-1 and produced decreased levels of interleukin-1{beta} upon efferocytosis of tumour cells.

Here, we test fundamental questions on the role of constraints on gene expression evolution arising from the mode of selection and genetic architecture. We also test the relationship between sex-biased expression and evolved sexual dimorphism (SD). We assess these using body size selection lines in the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, that have evolved variation in SD in response to either sex-limited (SL) or sexually antagonistic (SA). We find that sex differences in the phenotypic responses and expression changes are generally well aligned. SL selection, despite a phenotypic response similar to SA selection in males, but not in females, resulted in a more extensive expression differentiation and increase of sex-biased expression than SA selection. These patterns show that SA selection imposes a transcriptomic constraint and is not required for sex-bias to evolve. Sex-biased transcripts show lower cross-sex correlations in expression changes than unbiased transcripts, suggesting greater sex differences in their underlying genetic architecture. Although male-biased transcripts are disproportionately affected when selection targeted males, we find no support for a transcriptome-wide association between sex-bias and SD. In the light of these unique experimental insights into how sex-specific selection on size changes adult transcription, our findings have important implications for inferring selection history and mode from patterns of sex-biased gene expression in natural populations.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

In rats in which the sciatic nerve is transected and repaired, soleus (SOL) H-reflex up-conditioning during regeneration strengthens primary afferent reinnervation of SOL motoneurons and improves recovery of the SOL H-reflex. This suggests that H-reflex up-conditioning could improve functional recovery after nerve injury and repair. To explore this possibility, we examined the impact of SOL H-reflex up- or down-conditioning during sciatic regeneration on recovery of locomotor symmetry. Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with EMG electrodes in right SOL and a stimulating cuff on right posterior tibial nerve. After control data collection, right sciatic nerve was transected and repaired. Control EMG and H-reflex data collection continued for 20 more days. The rat was then exposed for 100 days to either: continued control data collection; SOL H-reflex up-conditioning; or SOL H-reflex down-conditioning. Locomotor EMG, H-reflex, and kinematics were assessed before nerve transection and 120 days after transection. H-reflex up-conditioning improved H-reflex recovery and also restored right/left step symmetry. H-reflex down-conditioning did not worsen H-reflex recovery or right/left step asymmetry.

Although prediction errors have been widely observed across the brain, the downstream processes that link them to attentional shifts and decision-making remain poorly understood. In this study, we recorded electrocorticography in urethane-anesthetized rats and identified robust cortical slow oscillations, characterized by reliable transitions between Up and Down states. Deviant stimuli in an auditory oddball paradigm evoked an initial prediction error, followed by prolonged, all-or-nothing cortical Up states whose occurrence depended on anesthetic depth.

To determine the neural architecture underlying interhemispheric coordination, we analyzed simultaneous bilateral prefrontal cortex recordings from three macaque monkeys performing a visuo-spatial working memory task. Both hemispheres equally predicted behavioral imprecisions across the visual field and decoding errors were weakly correlated between hemispheres, suggesting a redundant, weakly coupled organization. Attractor network simulations showed that redundancy improved precision when task demands were below memory capacity, while weak interhemispheric coupling increased capacity in more demanding tasks by allowing hemispheric specialization. This interhemispheric architecture reconciles previous findings thought to support distinct models into a unified architecture, revealing a versatile interhemispheric architecture that adapts to varying cognitive demands.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

G.; Schmidt, M. L.", "abstract": "The Laurentian Great Lakes hold 21% of the world's surface freshwater and supply drinking water to nearly 40 million people. Here we provide the first evidence that wind-driven upwelling fundamentally restructures microbial communities in Lake Ontario, with its effects extended and redistributed by an internal Kelvin wave propagating along the shoreline. While thermal stratification is known to organize microbial communities by depth and season, we show that this vertical structure arises from contrasting mechanisms: homogenizing selection in surface waters and dispersal limitation with drift in the hypolimnion. Kelvin wave-driven upwelling disrupts this scaffold, displacing rare taxa into the surface and creating novel coastal communities enriched in methane oxidation and sulfur metabolism genes--functional traits absent elsewhere in the lake. We observed a Kelvin wave lasting over two weeks and propagating eastward at ~60 km/day. Given the ~10-12 day recurrence of wind events (1), at any time, at least one segment of Lake Ontario's coastline is typically experiencing upwelling--producing pulses frequent and sustained enough to remodel microbial communities on ecologically relevant timescales. Recurrent upwellings, sustained and redistributed by Kelvin waves, act as a biological disturbance that overrides stratification, mobilizes rare functional potential, and assembles novel coastal microbial communities. As climate change lengthens stratified periods and reshapes large-lake circulation, understanding how physical forcing governs microbial assembly is essential for forecasting the biogeochemical future of Earth's great lakes, especially in shoreline zones where ecological shifts directly affect human communities.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Using lattice light sheet microscopy imaging and automated near-complete tracking of kinetochores at fine spatio-temporal resolution, we produce a detailed atlas of kinetochore metaphase-anaphase dynamics in untransformed human cells (RPE1). We determined the support from this dataset for 17 models of metaphase dynamics using Bayesian inference, demonstrating (1) substantial sister asymmetry that transversely organises the metaphase plate (MPP), (2) substantial spatial organisation of KT dynamic properties within the MPP, and (3) mechanical parameter time dependence, K-fiber forces tuning over the last 5 mins of metaphase towards a set point referred to as the anaphase ready state.

Early-life stress can have severe and lifelong effects on Darwinian fitness. Indeed, it is well established that being reared in a larger brood impairs growth and fitness prospects of birds, but the mechanistic underpinnings of this effect are still largely unknown. Specifically, it is not well known to what extent the reduced growth and fitness prospects of nestlings reared in large broods is due to increased resource allocation to competition versus a per capita reduction in parental provisioning rate, or a combination of the two. We cross-fostered zebra finch (Taeniopygia castanotis) chicks into small and large broods, and recorded their growth as well as the behavior of parents and offspring throughout the nestling period. As in previous experiments, growth rate was higher in small broods. In large broods, chicks begged more and parents invested more time feeding which more than compensated for the difference in brood size. We therefore conclude that the lower growth rate for nestlings raised in large broods must be attributed to increased energy expenditure on begging rather than a reduction in the amount of food received. These results suggest significant energetic costs associated with begging and raise the interesting possibility that brood size would not have negatively affected growth in large broods if chicks had not increased their begging effort due to increased levels of competition in nest.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

In alignment with transcriptomic findings, imaging and electrophysiological recordings from aged vestibular sensory epithelia confirmed the degeneration of the hair bundles and a reduction in mechanotransduction. Importantly, this deterioration of hair bundles and vestibular function precedes HC loss, highlighting impaired mechanotransduction as a key contributor to ARVD.

This study utilized FPVS to investigate neural responses to facial expressions in individuals with elevated anxiety-related characteristics (e.g., prior diagnosis or elevated symptom scores) and those without. EEG responses were recorded while participants viewed sequences of neutral faces interspersed with emotional oddball expressions (angry, fearful, happy, and sad). Results revealed robust neural discrimination responses to all facial expressions. Participants with anxiety-related characteristics showed significantly greater summed baseline-corrected amplitudes (BCA) at occipital electrodes in response to angry and sad oddball faces compared to the low-anxiety group. This was accompanied by reduced top-down interactions. Although, dimensional anxiety scores were generally low, suggesting results may reflect residual or trait-level differences rather than acute symptomatology, these findings provide preliminary evidence that FPVS may be sensitive to enduring differences in emotion processing associated with anxiety vulnerability.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

To this end, we characterized the nest digging activity of the yellow meadow ant Lasius flavus confined to dig in a nearly two-dimensional experimental setup maintained at a constant temperature ranging from 15 to 30 degrees Celsius. Ants dug faster at higher temperature, with an increase of digging rate that reflected the temperature-induced increase of movement speed of individual ants. Nevertheless, the shape of excavated nests remained statistically unchanged across the full range of temperatures we tested. These results suggest that temperature accelerates all aspects of the excavation process uniformly, rather than selectively influencing specific components such as tunnel branching or elongation.

These markers were also elevated in Mtb-infected aged wild type (WT) mice but not in young WT mice. Global transcriptomics data revealed upregulation of pro-survival (PI3K, MAPK) and anti-apoptotic pathways in Mtb-infected B6.Sst1S macrophages.

Senolytic drug treatment prolonged survival and reduced Mtb lung counts in B6.Sst1S and aged WT mice to a greater degree than young WT mice and concomitantly reduced lung senescence markers.

To overcome current barriers, preclinical mouse models that faithfully recapitulate the tumor genetics, mutation burdens, and neoantigen patterns of specific human tumor types are essential. However, while many models exist for melanoma, there are currently relatively few transplantable murine models of cSCC, which is responsible for nearly as many deaths as melanoma each year. Here we describe a novel series of 11 cSCC tumor lines, the Carcinogen-Induced Tumor (CIT) lines, syngeneic to the FVB strain, that address this need. The CIT lines were established from skin carcinomas induced by DMBA and TPA treatment and harbor genetic drivers and overall tumor mutational burdens that recapitulate those found in cSCC. Each CIT line gives rise to tumors with a consistent immune infiltration pattern, ranging from T cell-rich \"hot\" tumors to T cell-poor \"cold\" tumors. Hot CIT lines exhibit partial responses to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and we have identified two neoantigens present in an immunotherapy-responsive CIT line. The CIT lines thus provide a valuable new series of preclinical models for studying anti-tumor immune responses and developing strategies to improve immunotherapy efficacy in cSCC.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Evolution of bacterial resistance to bacteriophages and bacteriophage counter-resistance (coevolution) during therapy may explain some of this variation, the dynamics of which may be affected by interactions with the patients immune system. Here, we examine how a pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa coevolves with two clinically relevant bacteriophages (14-1 and PNM) when in the presence of macrophages (RAW 264.7 cell line). We show macrophages reduced the rate by which bacteria were killed by bacteriophages, likely by reducing bacteria-bacteriophage contact rates. Over evolutionary time-scales, macrophages increased the proportion of bacteriophage resistant bacteria compared to where macrophages were absent. These differences in resistance rates were likely driven by the early advantage in density offered by macrophages to bacteria, and exclusion of PNM from the bacteriophage cocktail which otherwise increased in frequency in the absence of macrophages. Consequently, macrophages significantly altered the short- and long-term efficacy of a bacteriophage cocktail. In line with a growing body of work, our results suggest that the patients immune system can reduce the efficacy of phage therapy, potentially driving variable outcomes in therapy success in patients.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Evolutionarily-young L1s are transcribed in human pluripotent stem cells, but how CpG methylation is patterned to these L1s upon exit of pluripotency is unknown. Here we investigate the critical functions of chromatin regulator MORC2 in epigenome reprogramming of the repetitive genome in early human neurodevelopment. We find that reversible ATP-dependent dimerization is required for MORC2 accumulation over L1s but not gene promoters. Engineered mutations of the MORC2 ATPase module severely disrupts the distribution of MORC2 chromatin binding, leading to simultaneous loss of L1 transcriptional control and hyper-repression of clustered ZNF genes in human pluripotent stem cells. Upon neural differentiation these phenotypes persist due to striking, targeted defects in CpG methylation patterning. Together our results define the vital role of MORC2 in safeguarding the somatic human genome upon exit of pluripotency by directing CpG methylation patterning over transcriptionally-active retrotransposons in a manner analogous to the piRNA pathway in the germline.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Predicting the impact of gene deletions is crucial for biological discovery, biomedicine, and biotechnology. For example, identifying lethal deletions is key for new cancer therapies or antimicrobial treatments that bypass drug resistance. In biotechnology, non-lethal deletions are a powerful strategy to redirect chemical flux toward production of high-value compounds for the food, energy, and pharmaceutical sectors, using genetically engineered cells as an alternative to petrochemicals. Owing to the cost and complexity of large-scale deletion screens, there is a growing interest in computational models that can leverage such data for predictive modelling. Here, we present Flux Cone Learning, a best-in-class framework for predicting the impact of metabolic gene deletions on many phenotypes of interest. Flux Cone Learning is based on high-dimensional Monte Carlo sampling of the metabolic space in tandem with supervised learning of fitness scores from deletion screens. We demonstrate unparalleled predictive accuracy for metabolic gene essentiality in organisms of varied complexity (Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells), outperforming the gold standard predictions of Flux Balance Analysis. Our method does not rely on an optimality principle and thus can be applied to a range of organisms where cellular objectives cannot be encoded as an optimization task. We showcase the versatility of Flux Cone Learning in other phenotypes by training a predictor of small molecule production from deletion screening data.

Given the amino acid sequence of the original enzyme and a set of residues for which the local environment should be conserved, i.e., the catalytic site, our approach generates mutants that differ vastly in the overall sequence while retaining the geometry of the conserved region, thereby representing promising candidates for further experimental screening. Unlike end-to-end deep learning approaches, whose results are harder to interpret and control, the use of a well-established, classic technique such as MC sampling allows us to easily interpret the generative process as the sampling of an energy landscape determined by the pLM. In turn, such an interpretation enables us to steer this generative process and control its outcome by making use of robust statistical mechanics concepts, e.g., temperature, thereby explicitly guaranteeing certain properties of the generated mutants. Given the increasing relevance of generative algorithms in the design and search for novel, optimised enzymes, we believe that our results constitute an important step for the future development of this class of techniques.

G.", "abstract": "Determining the intricate tapestry of human genetic relationships is a central challenge in population genetics and precision medicine. We propose that the principles of lexical connectivity, which words derive meaning from their contextual interactions, can be adapted to genetic data, enabling transformer models to reveal that individuals with higher genetic similarity form stronger latent connections. We explored this by transposing KING kinship-related matrices into the (query, key, value) QKV latent space within transformer models and determined that attention mechanisms can capture genetic relatedness in an unsupervised fashion. We found that individuals had an attention weight connectivity of 85.34% (p<0.05) if they were from within the same continent, compared to if they were from other continents. Surprisingly, we found that some encoder layers required inversion of their latent representations for this connectivity to become obvious. Lastly, we used BERTViz to create human-readable hyper-dense connectivity patterns among individuals. Our approach is purely based on attention, which yields a non-discrete spectrum of relatedness, and thus uncovers patterns on first principles. Seq2KING addresses the significant challenge of discovering population structures to construct a global human relatedness map, without relying on predefined labels. Our excavation into the latent space is a paradigm shift from legacy-supervised genetic methodologies, which presents a new way to understand the human pangenome as well as discern population substructures for creating precision genetic medicines.\n\nNon-Expert DescriptionIs it possible to build artificial intelligence (AI) to read the human genome as a first language? Why would one want such AI? We at Ecotone believe that such AI will provide the genetic coordinates needed to manufacture CRISPRs medications to cure about [~]10,000 genetic diseases. How does one build such AI? Our recently released model dnaSORA proposed a means to assign meaning to every single token (typically referred to as a base) of all 3 billion tokens in the human genome (Koreniuk and Njie, 2025). This builds the vocabulary for reading the human genome as a first language. For dnaSORA to work, it needs to know the heritages of people that are in its model of our genetics. We mostly rely on country, culture and geography to determine our heritages, but this is too error-prone for dnaSORA. Also error-prone in our experience are legacy genetic approaches such as those used by 23andMe.\n\nOur research here introduces Seq2KING, a new artificial intelligence method that is based on excavating the insides of transformers to uncover hidden patterns of genetic relatedness among people around the world--without needing any prior labels or categorizations. The key innovation of Seq2KING is applying the principles of lexical connectivity-- how words derive meaning through their relationships to other words--to genetic data. Just as \"dog\" gains meaning through its connections to words like \"pet,\" \"animal,\" and \"loyal,\" we show that individuals genomes can be understood through their genetic connections to others. We start by converting raw genetic data into a compact kinship matrix (using a tool called KING) that summarizes how closely everyone is related. We then feed these kinship values into a transformer model--the same kind of AI behind cutting-edge language tools like ChatGPT.\n\nInside the transformer, special components called \"attention heads\" learn which individuals are most similar, strengthening links between people from the same region and showing subtler connections across continents. Unlike legacy approaches that rely on discrete pre-defined categories, Seq2KING provides continuous measures of relatedness, allowing us to visualize connections between any individual and all other humans. Additionally, because Seq2KING operates directly within the transformers internal reasoning system, it can be seamlessly integrated as a component within larger genome interpretation systems--essentially functioning like high-speed cache memory for heritage assignments, dramatically improving both efficiency and scalability. By examining these attention patterns, we can reconstruct familiar population groupings--such as European, African, and Asian heritage--entirely by the models internal logic. Finally, we use a visualization technique (BERTViz) to turn these dense connection maps into intuitive diagrams that highlight population connections between individuals.\n\nBecause our approach doesnt rely on pre-assigned labels, it offers a truly unbiased way to explore human population structure. This could help scientists trace migration routes that resulted in the peopling of the continents, find subtle subgroups within larger populations, and remove \"background noise\" in genetic studies of disease. Ultimately, Seq2KING paves the way for more precise genetic maps of all humans, revealing the natural \"family trees\" hidden in our DNA and bringing us one step closer to reading the human genome as a first language.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

We further investigated the influence of sex by creating mixed-sex colonies, which revealed a similar hierarchical structure, with both males and females having equal chances of becoming high- or low-ranked. We previously found reduced dopamine neuron activity in high-ranked males; in contrast, high-ranked females show the opposite pattern. Furthermore, while glucocorticoid receptor signaling in dopaminoceptive neurons restricts high rank in males, this effect is absent in females.

Genetic studies have identified rare TREM2 variants as key risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD), with mutations affecting both the extracellular and transmembrane domains. While the TREM2-DAP12 complex is essential for microglial activation and implicated in Alzheimers disease pathology, the structural and mechanistic effects of transmembrane domain mutations, particularly within different TREM2 isoforms, remain unclear. In this study, we employ multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of six TREM2 mutations (four in isoform 1, two in isoform 2) and one wild-type control (isoform 2) on complex stability. By integrating coarse-grained and all-atom simulations with unsupervised machine learning techniques, we reveal distinct conformational states and residue-level interactions that govern complex formation. Our findings demonstrate how mutations such as W191X in TREM2 isoform 2 disrupt critical interactions, leading to destabilisation of the complex and potential impairments in neuroimmune signalling.

Tumor angiogenesis-specific miRNAs (angiomiRs) are a subset of miRNAs that are dyregulated in tumor endothelial cells. Because of the importance of angiogenesis in cancer progression, regulation of angiomiRs may have significant therapeutic implications. However, discovery of angiomiRs has often been limited by biased model systems that may not be valid. Here, we evaluated whether the variable expression levels of angiomiRs in endothelial cells were impacted by the isolation methods used to profile them. Using an autochthonous, genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we used Nanostring to profile miRNA expression levels of normal lung endothelial cells (NECs) to tumor endothelial cells (TECs) using two endothelial cell (EC) isolation methods: 1) staining and sorting ECs directly from tumors (\"in vivo\"), and 2) magnetic bead isolation and sub-cloning ECs (\"in vitro\"). We then compared candidate angiomiRs with the profiles from two orthotopic, immunocompetent lung cancer models. When TECs were directly enriched from tumors (\"in vivo\" method), three candidate angiomiRs (miR-30b, miR-1981, and miR-707) were significantly lower in TECs than NECs. In contrast, when ECs were isolated and cultured (\"in vitro\" method), three different candidate angiomiRs (miR-200a, miR-124 and miR-186) were significantly lower in TECs than NECs. Using two independent model systems for validation, we found miR-30b to be significantly reduced in TECs using freshly sorted ECs. Conversely, the in vitro discovered angiomiR candidates did not validate in these model systems, suggesting that TECs grown in vitro may not maintain relevant angiomiR profiles or serve as an adequate method for molecular profiling. Our findings demonstrate that angiomiR expression patterns are impacted by isolation methods. Instead of relying on ECs cultured in vitro, we suggest careful validation studies of cells freshly collected from tumors before determining whether a miRNA is a bona fide angiomiR.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Beyond their classical role in energy production, they dynamically coordinate processes like pyrimidine biosynthesis and heme metabolism, adapting their functions across the intra-erythrocytic development cycle (IDC). Their unique architecture and stage-specific roles enable the parasite to fine-tune mitochondrial gene expression, which operationally includes both sense and Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs) - a class of long non-coding RNAs. The study involves the analysis of transcriptomic data to identify significant differentially expressed genes, in both sense and NATs categories, associated with severe malaria manifestations. This emphasizes the critical role of mitochondrial gene regulation in disease severity. These genes were statistically ranked and then used as input features for machine learning analysis for verification. Machine learning acted as a hypothesis-testing framework, enabling refinement of gene lists and strengthening biological interpretations. Further, a comprehensive gene enrichment analysis was performed for both sense and NATs to investigate the mitochondrial or other cellular pathways impacted during severe malaria. The findings revealed that NATs have a striking association with mitochondrial pathways and translation machinery, indicating that NATs are not merely by-products of transcription but also play a regulatory role in fine-tuning mitochondrial gene expression with severe manifestation.

They are used to treat metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer, but resistance is common, and this has been associated with TP53 loss and senescence evasion. We show here that enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells that evade senescence mis-segregate chromosomes due to defective chromosomal alignment and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, leading to aneuploidy and DNA damage. The chromosome alignment errors are associated with impaired Sgo1 localisation to centromeres and defective sister chromatin cohesion during mitosis. Importantly, all these mitotic defects can be rescued by constraining cell size during the CDK4/6i-treatment, and specifically restoring cohesion rescues the chromosome segregation errors. Together, this demonstrates mechanistically how cell enlargement drives genetic and karyotypic change in cells that re-enter the cell cycle following CDK4/6 inhibition.

For mouse embryonic kidneys, this process can be studied in real time using ex vivo organ cultures. Previous imaging methods relied on Transwell filters with a long distance between objective and sample as well as low signal-to-noise ratio due to the filter membrane. Moreover, Wnt signaling was previously visualized with the expression reporters TCF/Lef:H2B-GFP. Methods We developed an ex vivo culture system based on low-volume media and fibronectin coating for real time imaging. We further made use of endogenously tagged Cherry-Lef1 and Ctnnb1-Venus reporter mouse lines as reporters for Wnt signaling during kidney development. Furthermore, we established an adaptive feedback microscopy pipeline to track the signal with high resolution. Results Using these approaches, we found that Cherry-Lef1 proteins are only expressed in the nascent nephron and derivatives. Expression is graded along distal-proximal nephron axis suggesting that the ureteric bud-derived Wnt9b is controlling its expression. Interestingly, we observed that Cherry-Lef1 gradient shifts from distal to proximal axis during nephron patterning. {beta}-catenin-Venus, on the other hand, first became visible in the ureteric bud, then in the nascent nephron after Lef1.

To enable mechanistic investigation of these traits (Graphical Abstract), we established the first myoblast cell lines from the pectoralis muscle of Pteronotus mesoamericanus, a highly maneuverable aerial insectivore.

This overcomes a key requirement of other GCN2 activators.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

V.; Chen, M.; Prendergast, A.; Mani, A.; Schwartz, M. A.", "abstract": "Fluid shear stress (FSS) from blood flow critically determines vascular stability and remodeling. The Smad1/5 pathway is activated by FSS through the BMP9/10 receptors Alk1 and Endoglin, with a maximal activation occurring at physiological magnitudes of FSS, to promote vascular homeostasis. Here, we report that the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor Latrophilin-2 (Lphn2), previously found to mediate flow activation of the canonical junctional complex, is required for flow-mediated Smad1/5 activation in endothelial cells. Lphn2 localized to endothelial junctions, physically associates with Endoglin, and is required for Smad1/5 activation by laminar shear stress but not soluble BMP9. This regulation was independent of G-protein signaling but required Lphn2s C-terminal PDZ binding motif. Endothelial-specific Lphn2 knockout reduced Smad1/5 activation in mice. In zebrafish embryos, both loss of flow and Lphn2 knockout similarly reduced endothelial Smad1/5 activation, with no additive effect, indicating Lphn2 mediates flow-induced activation in vivo. APEX2 proximity labeling revealed that the PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein Shank3 associated with Lphn2 under flow. Shank3 knockdown blocked flow-induced Smad1/5 activation in vitro and Shank3 knockout mice exhibited reduced endothelial nuclear Smad1/5 in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that Lphn2 mediates G protein independent Smad1/5 activation through Shank3. GWAS data revealed that Shank3 rare variants are associated with low risk of peripheral artery disease, suggesting a role for this pathway in cardiovascular disease.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

MDS is also associated with a higher incidence of osteoporosis, suggesting a complex interplay between hematopoiesis, the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, and bone homeostasis. Targeting inflammation has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, particularly in lower-risk MDS. Tasquinimod (TASQ) is a small-molecule inhibitor of the inflammatory alarmin S100A9, blocking its interaction with TLR4 and RAGE receptors. We investigated the efficacy of TASQ in modulating inflammation and improving disease phenotype using in vitro and in vivo MDS models. Immunofluorescence staining of human BM identified neutrophils and macrophages as primary S100A9 sources. Exposure of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to S100A9 induced TLR4 downstream signaling, resulting in increased expression of IRAK1, NF-kappaB-p65, IL-1beta, IL-18, caspase 1 and PD-L1. These effects were effectively abolished by TASQ. Additionally, TASQ restored the disturbed MSC-mediated hematopoietic support, as demonstrated by increased numbers of cobblestone area-forming cells and colony-forming units. In NHD13 MDS mice, TASQ (30 mg/kg, 12 weeks) improved hemoglobin and red blood cell counts, but exerted no effect in wild-type (WT) mice. Additionally, TASQ improved bone microarchitecture by increasing trabecular number and bone volume, likely a result of reduced osteoclast activity. Our findings suggest that TASQ mitigates inflammasome activation in the MDS BM, improving erythropoiesis and bone health. These results provide a necessary preclinical basis for clinical trials in lower-risk MDS patients, in whom anemia and osteoporosis often coexist.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Six concentrations of maleic hydrazide ranging from 5 to 55 ppm were applied for 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48h. The treatments reduced the germination percentages of Trigonella foenum-graecum and Allium cepa and inhibited the root growth of both plants. Concentrations higher 50 ppm for 48h were toxic for both plants. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed that there was significant difference (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) in the mean root length of both plants exposed to different concentrations of the maleic hydrazide. This indicated that the root growth inhibition was concentration dependent. The non-lethal of MH showed an inhibitory effect on cell division in root tips of both plants and caused a decrease in their mitotic index values. The reduction in MI in root tips of Allium cepa was more evident than that of Trigonella foenum-graecum. All treatments changed the frequency of mitotic phases as compared with the control values. All the used concentrations of MH significantly induced a number of chromosomal aberrations in root tip cells of Trigonella foenum-graecum and Allium cepa. The total percentages of abnormalities in Allium cepa root tip cells were more than that in Trigonella foenum-graecum with all concentrations less than 45 ppm of MH. The most dominant types of observed abnormalities were stickiness, C-mitosis and distributed metaphase and anaphase. MH treatments produced a number of mitotic abnormalities in dividing cells in root tips of both plants resulting from its action on the spindle apparatus such as C-metaphases, lagging chromosomes and multipolar anaphases and telophases. Also, MH induced vacuolated nuclei and irregular prophases. The induction of chromosomal stickiness and chromosomal aberrations such as bridges indicates its action on the chromosome. This abnormality (chromosomal bridges at Ana-telophases) indicates true clastogenic potential of the chemical. It may be concluded that MH causes toxic effect on root tip cells of Trigonella foenum-graecum and Allium cepa and this toxicity induces different types of genic and chromosomal variations.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we present structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC) in absence of sliding clamp or supplemented nucleotide. Our structures indicate that RFC holds onto ADP tightly in at least two of its four ATPase active sites, suggesting that nucleotide exchange is regulated. Our molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical data indicate that binding of the sliding clamp PCNA causes rapid exchange of tightly bound ADP.

Here we delineate those rules by combining an experimental system that allows us to sculpt epithelial shells and subject them to controlled deflation with a 3D computational model linking cytoskeletal dynamics to tissue mechanics. Experiments and simulations across several orders of magnitude in time and space reveal that buckling emerges for fast deflation relative to the cortexs relaxation time, and is suppressed by high contractility. We show, further, that the tissue develops wrinkle patterns with different degrees of symmetry breaking that depend on its size and viscous confinement. Strikingly, we find that epithelial buckling is a multiscale phenomenon involving long-lived supracellular folds but also short-lived subcellular wrinkles in the actin cortex. Finally, by forming epithelial shells with anisotropic curvature we rationally direct buckling into predictable wrinkle patterns. Our study shows that epithelial tissues can be understood as hierarchical materials with mechanical instabilities that can be harnessed to engineer epithelial morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

In eukaryotic cells, SNARE proteins drive membrane fusion for trafficking and for exocytic release in many contexts, from neurotransmission to enzymatic digestion, while other fusogens mediate cell-cell fusion for organ formation, placental development and gamete fusion. Enveloped viruses use glycoprotein fusogens for host cell entry and delivery of the viral genome. Despite this breadth of roles, a structural feature shared by many of these fusogens is their rod shape, conserved across the SNARE superfamily, the class I and II fusogen superfamilies and the class III fusogen family. Here we used highly coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the collective behavior of rod-like fusogens on the microscopically long timescales of physiological membrane fusion. Rod-generated entropic forces maintained a cleared fusion site, squeezed and hemifused the membranes, and then expanded and ruptured the hemifused connection to yield fusion. More fusogens generated higher entropic forces and faster fusion, consistent with electrophysiological measurements at neuronal synapses. The required fusogenic feature was the rod shape, since simulated SNARE complexes, class II EFF-1 fusogens, and model rod-shaped complexes entropically drove fusion along similar pathways, whereas globular complexes failed. Thus, rod-like fusogens are optimally shaped generators of entropic forces that drive membrane fusion. These results suggest a universal rod-based fusion mechanism may have been the evolutionary driver of structural convergence among major classes of eukaryotic and viral fusogens.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

S.; Lyons, J. G.", "abstract": "The cornea is a self-renewing, multilayered tissue maintained with remarkable precision. Its outermost layer, the corneal epithelium, consists of five to seven stratified cell layers, sustained by two coordinated processes: the centripetal migration of transit amplifying cells (TACs) from peripheral limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs), and delamination (vertical movement) of cells between layers. Despite this well-organized renewal, the mechanisms governing epithelial stratification remain largely unknown. In this study, we present a two-dimensional Voronoi cell-based model that captures the dynamics of epithelial stratification. Our model incorporates two distinct epithelial layers--the basal and the suprabasal layers--and accounts for key cellular processes. These processes are mediated by mechanical interactions such as cell-substrate adhesion, as well as horizontal and vertical intercellular forces. Our simulations show that cell delamination, which drives stratification, is strongly linked to TAC proliferation. In contrast, LESC division remains largely unchanged, suggesting that TACs buffer LESC activity, consistent with the slow-cycling nature of stem cells. This reveals that processes weakening the cell-to-substrate interaction will enhance the turnover of epithelial cells without the need for external growth factor induction, which is a notable finding. Interestingly, although increased shedding promotes division and delamination, excessive shedding leads to mechanical compensation via cell stretching in the upper layers. This mechanical response explains the presence of enlarged cells in the superficial layers of the corneal epithelium. Our model reveals a direct link between the shedding rate and the centripetal velocity of clonal growth, predicting that increased surface cell loss accelerates cell movement-a response similar to wound healing, where cells rapidly migrate to restore the damaged area. These results highlight how cell size, migration, and turnover are tightly coupled, and offer deeper insights into how physical forces work together to maintain and rapidly restore epithelial integrity.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Through a genetic functional screen, we discover that copper stress reduces OXA1L in mitochondria, disrupting MRPL20 import and impairing oxidative phosphorylation complex I synthesis. This mitochondrial dysfunction promotes MRPL20 nuclear translocation, triggering the mitochondrial unfolded protein response as an adaptive mechanism to restore mitochondrial proteostasis during early cuproptosis. Meanwhile, AMPK phosphorylates ISCU at serine 29, stabilizing ISCU protein, and increasing the abundance of Fe-S cluster-containing proteins, which, in turn, enhances cells susceptible to cuproptosis. Building on this mechanistic insight, we develop AMPK-SPARK, a phase separation-based EGFP reporter for real-time visualization of endogenous AMPK activity in living cells during cuproptosis.

Through screening, we discovered that the fibrillarin (FBL) protein in the nucleolus acts as a carrier for mono-ubquitinated histone H2A (H2Aub), regulating the balance between BMI1-mediated mono-ubiquitination of H2A and USP36-mediated deubiquitination of H2Aub. Under glucose starvation, FBL undergoes aggregation, leading to a significant reduction in its interaction with BMI1, accompanied by markedly decreased binding to histone H2A and H2Aub. Concurrently, Midnolin, which serves as a receptor for monoubiquitinated histones, exhibits increased interaction with FBL during glucose starvation. USP36, FBL, Midnolin, and BMI1 collectively form a complex responsible for degrading monoubiquitinated histones.

We discovered that histone degradation produces the highest amount of glutamine during glucose starvation. Further investigation revealed that histone H2A undergo degradation in the nucleolus in the form of mono-ubiquitination (H2Aub).

How cells balance the allocation of methyl pools between different sinks, remains under studied. In this study using S. cerevisiae, we identify a role of the amino acid response regulator Gcn4 (Atf4) in balancing the methyl allocations between phospholipids and histones when methionine is abundant. Here, when SAM/SAH ratio increases during methionine supplementation, Gcn4-dependent outputs critically regulate the appropriate allocation of methyl pools to phospholipids and histones. Gcn4 regulates phospholipid methylation by controlling Ino2 levels, which is a primary transcriptional regulator of phospholipid biogenesis. In the absence of Gcn4, Ino2 levels decrease, leading to the downregulation of the PE methyltransferases Cho2 and Opi3. This downregulation of these methyltransferases reduces SAM consumption for phospholipid biosynthesis, and in turn elevates the SAM/SAH ratio in the cell. The elevated SAM pools are subsequently re-allocated towards histone hyper-methylation. Our study reveals the novel role of Gcn4 as a regulator of phospholipid biosynthesis during methionine sufficiency, highlighting its role in appropriate methyl allocations in cells.

Analysis of lipid carbon-chain lengths reveals distinct signatures: 167k-NVEPs show pronounced enrichment at 16 and 18 carbons, while 100k-sEVs display enrichment at 32 and 34 carbons. This divergence indicates a potential connection to flexible biogenesis pathways. Marker heterogeneity across EV populations, confirmed by confocal and super-resolution microscopy, further underscores the limitations of relying on canonical tetraspanins for EV classification. Notably, 167k-NVEPs (likely exomeres) exhibit enrichment of Arf6 and CD63. Together, our findings provide compositional, biophysical, and molecular evidence supporting the formal recognition of 167k-NVEPs as a distinct class of extracellular particles and enabling exploring in disease biology and therapeutic delivery.\n\nSignificance StatementExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are critical mediators of intercellular communication, yet their classification remains clouded by ambiguity in terms of their composition and biogenesis. This study resolves critical uncertainties through a cross-kingdom meta-analysis, establishing a conserved [~]110nm diameter and [~]200 nm upper size limit for intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), the precursors to exosomes. More significantly, we identify non-vesicular extracellular particles (167k-NVEPs) as a distinct class based on their unique sterol-rich lipidome, enrichment in lipids of 16 and 18 carbon chain length, elevated protein-to-lipid ratio, and functional cargo delivery. These features, alongside evidence of non-canonical origin and functional cargo delivery, establish NVEPs as a discrete class of extracellular particles.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in which bacterial tryptophan metabolism activates lysosomal activity to promote lipid breakdown. By developing a lysosomal-responsive lipid reporter in C. elegans to screen for bacterial metabolic states that modulate host lipid storage, we discover that E. coli tryptophan catabolism via tryptophanase TnaA induces lysosomal lipid chaperone LBP-8, driving lipid mobilization. Moreover, tryptophan metabolites enhanced lysosomal acidification and degradation capacity, while genetic disruption of lysosomal regulators reversed these effects. Strikingly, bacterial tryptophan metabolism further promoted mitochondrial {beta}-oxidation through lysosomal lipase activity. This pathway was conserved in mammalian hepatocytes, where E. coli-derived tryptophan metabolites enhance lysosomal function and reduce lipid accumulation.

Here, we investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics by which Polycomb group (PcG) histone modifications, H3K27me3 and H2Aub, emerge during early embryogenesis. Using ChIP-seq and live imaging of CRISPR-engineered GFP-tagged PcG components, we show that PRC2-dependent H3K27me3 accumulates adjacent to a subset of E(z)-bound prospective Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) beginning in nuclear cycle 14 (NC14), with patterns indicative of nucleation followed by spreading. Surprisingly, PRE-binding factors Pho, Combgap, and GAGA-factor are excluded from interphase nuclei prior to NC10 despite nuclear localization of E(z) throughout early interphases. Loss-of-function studies further demonstrate that GAGA-factor is largely dispensable for PcG domain establishment, whereas the pioneer factor Zelda is required for proper deposition of H3K27me3 and H2Aub at a subset of Polycomb domains. The role of Zelda at Polycomb domains is context-dependent; a large subset of targets requires Zelda not for PcG factor recruitment, but instead to license a loaded PRE to deposit H3K27me3 and H2Aub.

Transcriptome comparisons revealed that MEPs already expressed much of the MEG program while continuing to express genes associated with parallel myeloid lineages. By contrast, ERY underwent an extensive program of gene induction along with repression of pan-hematopoietic and MEG genes. Maps of transcription factor (TF) occupancy also indicated distinct modes of regulation for the MEG and ERY programs, with MEG genes preferentially occupied by hematopoietic TFs in multipotent progenitors and continued occupancy post-commitment, in contrast to erythroid genes that were primarily occupied in committed ERY. Previous work had indicated a surprising discordance in the clustering of MEP with other hematopoietic cell types by RNA-seq versus chromatin states. We combined the differential expression data with chromatin accessibility across blood cell types to identify trends that contribute to this discordance. Specifically, candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in some ERY-specific genes were precociously actuated in the bipotential cell populations, and some other genes were expressed in both the MEP population and MEG but their cCREs have less chromatin accessibility in MEP.

Despite its importance, there are no established dietary recommendations for zinc supplementation in individuals with these conditions, except in cases of severe diarrhea in children. This gap stems from inconsistent outcomes in zinc supplementation trials, suggesting an incomplete understanding of zinc-mediated spatial and temporal regulation within the host-microbiome interface. This study employed a multiomics approach to investigate zinc-driven host-gut microbial interactions in the intestinal tract of mice fed zinc-adequate or ZnD diets. Radio tracing and metallomics analyses uncovered differential zinc abundance across intestinal tissues, with conventionalized germ-free mice displaying significantly lower zinc levels than germ-free mice, highlighting the reciprocal regulation of zinc between host tissues and gut microbes. Transcriptomic analyses revealed region-specific effects of ZnD, including altered energy metabolism and apoptosis in the small intestine, and impaired barrier function and redox processes in the colon. Metagenomics profiling revealed that ZnD reduced microbial diversity in the small intestine, while the cecum and colon were protected from diversity loss but exhibited an increased abundance of pathogenic bacteria. Correlation analyses linked tissue-specific host gene expression to shifts in microbial populations, identifying potential microbial mediators of host transcription changes under ZnD.

We have identified 12-hydroxystearic acid (12-HSA) as a potent stimulator of AMP secretion from primary epidermal keratinocytes. Mechanistic investigations revealed that, akin to bacterial stimulation,12-HSA induces AMP release through the downregulation of caspase-8, which subsequently activates the inflammasome.

Using the developing zebrafish fin fold, we identify BECs form distinct regions of collagen- versus laminin- enriched basement membranes through integrin-mediated adhesions.

In vivo, laminin deficiency enhances desmosome expression across layers and impairs the wound-healing capacity of SECs. This defect was partially rescued by genetic reduction of the desmosome protein Desmoplakin-1a, highlighting the role of ECM-dependent junctional specialization in mediating differences in SEC injury response.

Among the animal models studying PGC development, the chicken PGCs are an ideal model, since it is a rare model in which long-term PGC cultivation is applicable. Although the cultural applicability of chicken PGC makes it attractive for revealing the PGC character and its developmental processes, some differences from endogenous PGCs are known, such as the remarkable up-regulation of cell proliferation and a lesser ability to reach the gonads. Understanding these differences at the molecular level is crucial. To this end, we first performed SMART-seq-based single-cell RNA sequencing to compare transcriptomes between endogenous PGCs and cultivated PGCs. Our results revealed that PGC cultivation causes a shift from a MYC-dependent to a MYCN-dependent gene regulatory network in PGCs, suggesting that this reprogramming contributes to the acquisition of proliferation ability and stem cell characteristics in cultivated PGCs. Additionally, our results suggest that the MYCN-dependent gene regulatory network increases the risk of somatic differentiation, particularly in neural fate, in cultivated PGCs. In addition, our transcriptome analysis identified new cell populations that show molecular character as intermediate cell states between germline and pluripotent cells from the early embryonic stage. Thus, our study provides fundamental molecular information to understand both the effects of PGC cultivation and the developmental process of chicken PGCs.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Previous studies mainly relied on SMA detection in tissue sections and focused on a single organ or developmental stage. They often overlooked key smooth muscle markers such as CALPONIN and {gamma}SMA and largely neglected the LSM layer. In this study, we combined confocal imaging of whole-mount three-dimensional-cleared embryonic chick guts with heatmap analysis to generate the first spatial atlas of smooth muscle development. We characterize the expression patterns of SMA, {gamma}SMA, and CALPONIN1, thereby mapping the dynamics of the formation and differentiation of CSM and LSM layers along the antero-posterior axis.

As researchers create RNA nanostructures with the goal of becoming common in the molecular biologists' toolkit, more investigation is required on the robustness of RNA designs. Primarily, what different molecular contexts are the designed and intended nanostructures stable in? In this work we show that by using second-order right-angle light scattering, that RNA nanostructure self-assembly is highly sensitive to environmental conditions. While a test RNA hexagonal grid nanostructure that forms correctly though 120{degrees} kissing loops under ideal conditions, small variations in salt conditions and annealing times cause the nanostructure to form less structured variants. Tertiary contacts for self-assembly require magnesium and break over a broad range of low temperatures, melting at 42 {degrees}C. In contrast this was found to be considerably lower than the secondary structure melting which occurred at 75 {degrees}C.

{"title": "Toward pharmacologic therapy for glioblastoma: Identifying inhibitors of very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSVL3)", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.02.662811", "authors": "Clay, E. M.; Shi, X.; Kolar, E. A.; Mody, M.; Locke, J. E.; Watkins, P. A.", "abstract": "Brain tumors, in particular glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are among the most aggressive and difficult to treat human neoplasms. Even with combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate for GBM is only ~7%. Thus, new treatment approaches are needed. We previously found that the fatty acid metabolism enzyme very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSVL3) is overproduced in human glioma tissue and in glioblastoma cell lines such as U87MG cells. These cells exhibited malignant growth properties in culture and were tumorigenic in nude mice. When either knockdown or knockout strategies were used to deplete U87MG cells of ACSVL3, they adopted a more normal growth rate and produced significantly fewer, slower growing tumors in mice. An inhibitor of ACSVL3, if identified, could prove to be a valuable pharmacotherapeutic agent in GBM. Therefore, we sought to identify small molecule compounds that decrease or block the enzyme activity of ACSVL3, as measured by the formation of stearoyl-CoA from the 18-carbon saturated fatty acid stearic acid, a preferred substrate for ACSVL3. We approached this in two ways. First, we tested several compounds that were previously shown to inhibit the activity of a structurally and functionally related enzyme, ACSVL1. Several compounds tested showed inhibition of stearoyl-CoA formation in U87MG cells when added to an in vitro enzyme assay. These included drugs triflupromazine, phenazopyridine, chlorpromazine, emodin, and perphenazine which are approved for treating other conditions. Also inhibitory to stearoyl-CoA production were several compounds from a ChemBridge Corporation library designated CB2, CB5, CB6 and CB 16.2. One caveat regarding interpretation of these results is that in addition to ACSVL3, all cells including U87MG contain other acyl-CoA synthetases capable of using stearic acid as substrate. Therefore, we also measured stearoyl-CoA synthetase activity in ACSVL3-deficient U87MG cells (U87-KO). If a drug or compound is an ACSVL3 inhibitor, it should decrease total conversion of stearate to stearoyl-CoA more in U87MG than in U87-KO cells. By this criterion, most of the tested compounds showed some ACSVL3-specific inhibition. At the screening concentration of 80 M drug, CB5 and CB16.2 showed the greatest potency to inhibit ACSVL3 enzyme activity; at 10 M, CB5 still showed significant inhibition but CB16.2 did not. We conclude that these compounds are worthy of further investigation as potential therapeutic agents in GBM, but additional drugs that have greater specificity and are effective at significantly lower concentrations must also be identified. Therefore, our second strategy was to develop a high-throughput library screening assay. For this, we took advantage of the fatty acid transport capability of some ACSVL family members. ACSVL1, when heterologously expressed in COS-1 cells, promotes cellular uptake of the fluorescent fatty acid analog C1-BODIPY-C12; in contrast, overexpressed ACSVL3 does not. We used a domain-swapping strategy to replace the N-terminal 210 amino acids of ACSVL3 with the N-terminal 100 amino acids of ACSVL1, producing ACSVL1/3. Unlike ACSVL3, ACSVL1/3 robustly promoted C1-BODIPY-C12 uptake while retaining the catalytically active C-terminus of ACSVL3. Most of the drugs and compounds that decreased stearoyl-CoA synthetase inhibition also inhibited C1-BODIPY-C12 uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. Catalytically defective ACSVL1/3 mutants lost their ability to promote C1-BODIPY-C12 uptake. Thus, we conclude that chimeric ACSVL1/3 gained the fatty acid transport function of ACSVL1 while retaining the catalytic properties of ACSVL3. A pilot screening study of >1280 drugs from an approved drug library and >880 compounds from a library of drugs predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier detected more than 50 molecules that lowered C1-BODIPY-C12 by more than 3 standard deviations. Although secondary screening will likely exclude many or all of these, our findings support the notion that we have developed a viable method for detecting potential ACSVL3 inhibitors. Further characterization may reveal candidate pharmacologic agents for treatment of GBM and other cancers.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Utilizing LysargiNase digestion and isotope-labeled synthetic peptides, we demonstrate that this effect is likely driven by the inherent instability of b-type fragment ions during collision-induced dissociation. Furthermore, we show that a stepped HCD strategy enables enhanced sequence coverage and robust CycIm ion detection (~99%), thereby improving the depth, reliability and speed of PTM identification.

BDQ and its fumarate salt (BDQ-F) significantly amplified CFZ-induced cytotoxicity in PI-sensitive and PI-resistant MM cells, in AL amyloidosis and other B-cell malignancies, with minimal toxicity toward normal cells. Mechanistic studies confirmed that BDQ specifically targets the ATP5F1C subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase. BDQ-CFZ combination triggered extensive apoptosis, exacerbating proteotoxic stress and proteasome-associated pathways. BDQ specifically enhanced CFZ inhibition of the proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity. Importantly, BDQ synergized with multiple proteasome and ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitors, but not with other standard MM agents, underscoring its selective interaction with the UPS pathway. BDQ-CFZ co-treatment markedly reduced MM cell viability and tumor burden in patient-derived cells and zebrafish xenograft models.

Despite its fundamental role in intestinal homeostasis, the mechanisms that trigger, compartmentalize, and execute intestinal cell extrusion remain largely unknown. Here, using intestinal organoids, we map the three-dimensional forces and cytoskeletal dynamics that drive intestinal cell extrusion. We show that, unlike in other epithelia, extrusion is initiated by the sudden dissolution of a contractile myosin 2A meshwork triggered by a calcium influx. Following meshwork dissolution, the extruding cell and its neighbors generate an upwards traction force that requires myosin contractility but is generated by lamellipodial protrusions in neighboring cells. Importantly, these lamellipodia not only act as force generators but also determine whether extrusion occurs apically or basally, serving as symmetry breakers of the process. Finally, we show that compartmentalization of cell extrusion to the outside of the intestinal crypt does not require curvature and instead depends on myosin 2A. Our findings reveal that the intestinal epithelium exhibits a distinctive mode of extrusion, in which tension differentials - rather than compressive stresses from crowding - trigger and compartmentalize cell removal.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Ant societies are vulnerable to parasitic \"myrmecophiles\": impostor species that infiltrate colonies and are often unable to survive outside of them. Here we show that obligate dependence of a myrmecophile on its host arises from irreversibility of the fundamental steps that achieve social acceptance inside the nest. We report a convergent system in which parallel rove beetle lineages (Staphylinidae) evolved from free-living ancestors to parasitize the same host ant. Exploiting this system, we uncover cellular mechanisms by which these beetles mimic host ant cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs): nestmate recognition pheromones, which function pleiotropically to prevent desiccation. We present evidence of a biological stealth mechanism in a rove beetle in which the CHC biosynthetic machinery becomes transcriptionally silenced on entering the nest. Silencing transforms the beetle into a chemical blank slate onto which ant CHCs are horizontally transferred via interspecies grooming behavior. This strategy leads to identical chemical resemblance and seamless social integration within the colony. CHC pathway silencing is irreversible, however, forcing the beetle into a chronic, physically close dependence on ants to both maintain nestmate status and prevent desiccation. Loss of CHC silencing renders the beetle detectable to ants; conversely, loss of behavioral attraction to ants renders the beetle desiccation prone. Our findings show how symbiotic entrenchment can arise from a Catch-22-like ratchet operating at the organismal level.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Today's diagnostic work-up still relies on peripheral tissue or a cardiac biopsy, while circulating levels of TTR or other plasma markers have little diagnostic value. Although extracellular vesicles (EVs, as key mediators of intercellular communication) may reflect disease-specific molecular changes, their protein cargo has not yet been explored in the context of TTR amyloidosis (ATTR) cardiomyopathy. Objectives: To characterize the plasma EV proteome in ATTR cardiomyopathy and identify potential biomarkers for pathophysiological pathways, diagnosis, or prognosis. Methods: We performed mass-spectrometry-based, label-free, proteomic profiling of plasma EVs from 65 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to TTR amyloidosis (the ATTR+ group, n=41) or non-amyloid cardiac disease (the ATTR- group, n=24). The groups were matched by age and sex. Results: A distinct protein signature comprising 117 deregulated proteins was identified in EVs from ATTR+ patients. The ATTR+ EVs were enriched in proteins associated with vascular homeostasis, coagulation, and inflammation. At least 18 of these proteins formed an interconnected network centered on plasmin/plasminogen. Notably, EV levels of TTR and plasminogen levels were elevated, while the level of alpha2-antiplasmin (plasmin's primary inhibitor) was low. This imbalance is particularly relevant because plasmin is known to promote amyloidogenesis via TTR cleavage. Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ATTR cardiomyopathy and suggest that plasma EV proteins are potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Several critical human proteins involved in COPD pathogenesis such as MMP 1, MMP 2, MMP 14, TNF-, TGF-{beta} were evaluated for the presence of microbial homologous proteins using BLAST analysis in the microbial database.

Further molecular docking simulations were conducted using herbal drugs (oleanolic acid, gingerol, nobiletin, menthol among others) known for their anti-inflammatory effect and can be potentially used in the treatment of COPD. Results demonstrated favourable interactions between these composites and both human and microbial proteins, indicating therapeutic potential of the compounds.

Considerable effort has focused on parasite development and immunological responses after snail penetration, but comparatively little is known about the molecular and behavioral host seeking events that precede it, primarily due to technical and physical constraints. To address this gap, we developed a custom imaging and computational system for tracking and screening schistosome miracidia, the snail-infective larval form that hatches from eggs. Our system employs an array of cameras without magnification and acrylic devices that maintain miracidia within the focal plane, create a field of view over 200,000 times the area of a single miracidium, and support the formation of stable chemical gradients. Using this platform, we perform quantitative ethology of miracidia at an unprecedented scale and extract features that drive the emergent chemoklinokinetic behavior in response to snail cues. We demonstrate that miracidia accumulate at the edge of a gradient of snail cues by increasing key chemoklinokinetic features upon leaving the region of a cue, corroborating previous reports. In contrast, miracidia do not exhibit these behaviors when the cue is uniform, demonstrating that they represent a specific sensory response rather than generic neuromuscular activity. We further find that a previously identified stimulatory snail peptide only partially recapitulates the full chemoklinokinetic profile, and homologues from closely related species elicit divergent behavioral outcomes. Notably, some of these snail peptides can mask a natural gradient and inhibit miracidia penetration of snails.

Our findings demonstrate that VBIT-4 disrupts membrane integrity by partitioning into lipids and inducing membrane defects rather than specifically inhibiting VDAC1 oligomerization, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results and the importance of revisiting conclusions drawn from its prior use.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

By-and-large microfluidic automation has been implemented using polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) a material that presents challenges for scalable manufacturing. In this paper, we fabricated an automated microfluidic device composed of thermoplastic material, poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and demonstrated a sophisticated workflow consisting of plasma extraction, sample aliquoting and sample-reagent mixing steps performed in the device. Automation was accomplished using multiple on-board microvalves consisting of a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) membrane sandwiched between PMMA flow and control layers. In addition to novel microvalves, our device included features designed to address challenges arising from the gas impermeable nature of PMMA. These features included a bubble trap and air micro-tanks to supply O2 for enzymatic reactions. We rigorously characterized the performance of the microfluidic device and demonstrated that the quality of plasma extracted in the device is comparable to a standard plasma isolation method involving centrifugation. We also showed close agreement between glucose levels measured in the device and by standard assay. As a final demonstration of utility, we loaded 5 L of blood, isolated plasma and detected three analytes simultaneously, glucose, lactate and H2O2. In addition to minimizing the volume of blood and eliminating standard laboratory equipment (e.g., centrifuge), our device enabled a rapid response (<10 min). The use of thermoplastic materials may pave the way for inexpensive, mass-produced automated microfluidic devices for rapid detection of blood biomarkers at the point of care.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Preclinical assessment of new rate and metabolism modulators can be augmented through the development of high-throughput (HT) methods that allow chronic measurements. Such approaches are best coupled with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) - a scalable experimental model of the human heart. Here, we evaluate the utility of long-term optical (label-free) measurements of pericellular oxygen in a HT format (96-well plates) for the assessment of the effectiveness of adrenergic drugs in hiPSC-CMs. Quantitative metrics were derived from these long-term measurements, e.g. steady-state pericellular oxygen and time to reach 5%, and we sought correlation to measurements performed in the same samples using all-optical electrophysiology. Adrenergic agonists significantly increased oxygen consumption rate, and this was best seen in the kinetics of initial depletion of pericellular oxygen, i.e. time to reach 5%. Adrenergic antagonists decreased oxygen consumption rate and their action was best quantified using steady-state values for pericellular oxygen after at least 5 hours. Drug type identification based on oxygen consumption rate correlated well with the acute measurements of spontaneous rate in the same samples. Furthermore, we showed that direct rate modulation with chronic optogenetic pacing detectably sped up the oxygen consumption rate and optogenetic transformation did not interfere with classification of adrenergic drugs. We conclude that HT label-free optical oxygen measurements may be a valuable approach for long-term non-invasive monitoring of the action of rate- and metabolism-modulating drugs in preclinical studies.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Despite extensive study in complex tissues, the minimal mechanical requirements driving intercalation remain poorly understood due to confounding tissue level interactions. Here, we present a novel morphogenesis-on-chip assay utilizing micropatterned cell quadruplets. This system isolates the elementary unit of intercalation while enabling quantitative force and shape measurements. Cross-shaped micropatterns generate stable four cell configurations in MDCK epithelial cells. Surprisingly, these cells spontaneously undergo T1 transitions autonomously. We combined live imaging with force inference and traction force microscopy, which revealed that intercalation emerges from two distinct mechanisms: interfacial tension dynamics and differential cell migration. Specifically, we show a correlation between central junction shrinkage and increased relative tension. Similarly, we show a correlation between central junction shrinkage and migratory forces. We successfully adapted the assay to Xenopus mesoderm cells, revealing conserved mechanical principles across cell types. Furthermore, experimentally derived effective energy landscapes closely match theoretical vertex model predictions, and suggest a dominant role for migratory forces in driving intercalation. This confirms that our minimal system recapitulates the fundamental physics of intercalation. This approach provides the first quantitative framework for studying intercalation mechanics in isolation and establishes a versatile platform for investigating morphogenetic processes.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Although innate immunity has been well studied in MASH, the role of CD4+ T cells remains underexplored despite their potential to coordinate immune responses by providing help to other immune cells, promoting inflammation, or regulating immune activity through effector and regulatory subsets. To better understand the role of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of MASH, we comprehensively characterized hepatic CD4+ T cells in murine and human MASH at a single-cell protein, transcriptional, and functional level. Mass cytometry and CITE-sequencing revealed a marked shift in intrahepatic CD4+ T-cell composition in MASH, with enrichment of Th1, regulatory, and cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. Similar phenotypic changes were mirrored in the peripheral blood and validated in human MASH samples. Functional assays demonstrated increased production of IFN{gamma} and TNF by hepatic CD4+ T cells, highlighting their proinflammatory effector activity. Transcriptomic profiling identified Tnfrsf4 (OX40) upregulation in hepatic CD4+ T cells during MASH. Therapeutic blockade of the OX40L-OX40 axis reversed hepatic fibrosis and improved histologic disease scores in mice with established MASH, and also decreased inflammatory markers in a human ex vivo liver model. Together, these studies provide a proteogenomic single-cell atlas for hepatic CD4+ T cells and uncover a CD4+ T cell-dependent immunopathogenic circuit as a promising immunotherapeutic target to alleviate MASH and liver fibrosis.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that in cle40 mutants, meristematic cells differentiate prematurely, resulting in shortened PRMs and ultimately, reduced root growth. Furthermore, we link these effects to increased cytokinin signaling that can be circumvented by preventing the perception of cytokinin. We highlight how increased cytokinin signaling leads to a change in auxin distribution mediated by SHORT HYPOCOTYL 2 (SHY2), which is ectopically activated if CLE40 is not active.

From a family systems framework, these stressors may spill over into the parent-child relationship, undermining emotional attachment and co-regulation processes central to children's mental health. Neural synchrony, defined as the dynamic, mutual alignment of brain activity between a parent and child, offers a biological index of these dyadic processes. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, researchers have shown that greater neural synchrony (NS) in prefrontal brain regions is associated with more attuned caregiving and positive child adjustment. Yet, NS is not uniform; it varies across dyads in pattern and regional distribution, potentially reflecting differences in relational dynamics, regulation, or stress exposure. To capture this heterogeneity, we used latent profile analysis to identify distinct synchrony patterns along the right and left ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices during the DB-DOS:Biosynch - a mild stress, three-context task. We further examined whether interparental conflict and perceived parental stress predicted profile membership, and whether children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors differed by profile. Among 194 dyads, two profiles emerged: lower baseline synchrony (LB; n = 132) and higher baseline synchrony (HB; n = 62). Greater interparental conflict reduced the odds of membership in HB, while parental stress was not predictive of profile membership. Additionally, children in LB exhibited higher levels of internalizing behaviors compared to HB, with no group differences observed for externalizing behaviors. These findings underscore the value of capturing synchrony heterogeneity in understanding family stress and child psychopathology.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined the role of larval oenocytes - hepatocyte-like cells, in a Drosophila model of cancer cachexia. We found that oenocytes in tumour-bearing larvae accumulate lipid droplets in response to tumour-secreted signals, Gbb and ImpL2. This lipid accumulation reflects systemic changes in lipid metabolism, responding to lipid metabolism manipulations in either the fat body or the muscle. Disrupting lipid synthesis (via FASN1 and DGAT1), storage (via Lsd2), or trafficking (via apolipoproteins) in these tissues significantly modulated lipid droplet accumulation in oenocytes. Moreover, oenocyte-specific knockdown of FASN1 reduced their lipid content and non-autonomously affected lipid droplet size in the fat body, suggesting cross-regulatory interactions between these tissues. Cachectic oenocytes also exhibited altered signaling profiles, characterized by reduced PI3K and elevated Wnt and Ecdysone activity. Enhancing PI3K signaling through Akt overexpression restored oenocyte size and reduced lipid levels; however, these changes did not significantly improve muscle integrity. Together, our data suggests that dynamic exchange of lipids occur between the fat body, oenocytes and the muscle during cancer cachexia. While the fat body and muscle lipid pools are key regulators of muscle integrity, oenocytes - despite their metabolic responsiveness, do not appear to play an active role in preserving muscle function during cachexia.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Oxysterols are oxidized metabolites of cholesterol that can interact with developmental signaling pathways. Using an iPSC model recapitulating human forebrain GABAergic neuron development and single-cell transcriptomic profiling, we show that 24S, 25-epoxysterol, an NDD-affected oxysterol highly enriched in the fetal brain, promotes neurogenesis, and disturbs the composition of GABAergic neuronal subtypes.

While gene expression was uniform at the 2-cell stage, variability increased at the 4-cell stage and became pronounced by the 8-cell stage. At this stage, blastomeres showed heterogeneity in MAPK pathway genes (e.g., RAC1, MAPK14) and the trophectoderm marker CDX2. These differences were associated with blastomere size; larger blastomeres more frequently initiated cavity formation, a functional marker of trophectoderm fate.

In the context of wild populations, one key challenge is to understand sources of variation that impact the commensal microbiome, which in turn shapes the degree of protection. Here, we surveyed both disease symptoms and microbiomes from wild populations of Arabidopsis thaliana over four consecutive seasons (fall/spring) across three different land use types. Land use types were stratified by anthropogenic influences and included forest meadows, human-impacted fields adjacent to agriculture or municipal parks, and highly disturbed habitats near railroad tracks. By building an integrative map of abiotic and biotic variables, we find that a key predictor of disease was biodiversity across ecological scales. Higher diversity plant communities reduced disease burden in A. thaliana populations but also increased diversity within the microbiome of A. thaliana. This increased microbial diversity was additionally associated with less disease in A. thaliana. However, the diversity-microbiome-disease relationships were all sensitive to season and further modulated by land use.

Using a biologically grounded computational model of burst-and-coast swimming in Hemigrammus rhodostomus, we investigate how group size and the strength of social interactions shape collective dynamics under perturbation. The model integrates experimentally derived attraction and alignment rules, behavioral heterogeneity, and boundary effects within a circular tank. We identify four collective states (schooling, milling, turning, and swarming) and characterize a critical regime in which groups exhibit multistable dynamics. At this critical point, small subsets of perturbing individuals, defined by altered social interaction strengths, can induce sharp transitions to new collective states. In particular, such transitions occur in large groups (N = 100) but not in smaller ones (N = 25 or 50), highlighting a size-dependent sensitivity to disturbance. We show that both the nature of the perturbing individuals and the initial state of the group modulate the system's responsiveness.

In some species, events of rejection can trigger chains of rejection which replicate themselves through generations. In this study we hypothesized that rejecting behaviours in owl monkeys are triggered and epigenetic in nature, transmitted to descendants, and their manifestation is associated with altered miRNA expression. Analysis of multi-generational records revealed that individuals who experienced rejection in infancy were 1.9 times more likely to reject their own offspring compared to controls, confirming its triggered nature. Transmission appears induced by experience rather than solely explained by genetic relatedness, as non-rejected full siblings showed no increased rejection tendency. Transcriptomic analysis identified distinct microRNA signatures associated with epigenetically induced rejecting behaviours. In rejected adults that become rejectors of their own offspring, mml-miR-1296-5p, involved in lipid metabolism was significantly downregulated. In the naive daughters of rejected-rejectors, upregulated mml-miR-125b-5p, previously identified as biomarker in humans exposed to early life trauma that also suffered behavioural pathology, was identified.

A.; Santicchia, F.; Matthysen, E.; Leirs, H.; Vanden Broecke, B.", "abstract": "Animal personality and parasite infections are key forces shaping the ecology and evolution of natural populations. Personality traits, such as activity, exploration, and boldness, shape how individuals interact with their environment and conspecifics, influencing both their exposure and susceptibility to parasite infection. In turn, parasites can impact host fitness and energy allocation, and may modify host behaviour either through manipulations to enhance transmission or as consequences of energetic trade-offs associated with mounting an immune response. Despite growing interest in the interplay between behaviour and infection, the overall directionality and consistency of personality-parasite relationships remain unclear. This relationship is further modulated by ecological and biological factors, such as parasite type (e.g. micro-, ecto-, or endoparasites) and host type (e.g. intermediate versus definitive), which can influence both infection risk and the nature of behavioural responses. To disentangle these effects, we performed a meta-analysis of 226 effect sizes across 80 studies, assessing (i) the impact of experimental infections on host personality traits, and (ii) the correlation between personality and infection status in observational studies of wild populations, while accounting for variation in parasite groups and host roles. In experimental studies, infected hosts exhibited significantly reduced levels of activity and exploration, while effects on boldness and aggressiveness were non-significant. These findings suggest that infection imposes energetic costs that suppress behaviours requiring sustained effort, such as movement and exploration. Conversely, observational studies showed a positive association between activity-exploration and infection probability, likely reflecting greater exposure of more active individuals to parasites via increased interaction with conspecifics or contaminated environments. Meta-regression analyses further revealed that parasite type and host role modulate personality-infection dynamics. In experimental studies, microparasites were associated with reduced boldness and activity-exploration, while endoparasites led to reduced activity-exploration, particularly in intermediate hosts. Notably, hosts showed significant behavioural suppression in experimental contexts, but not in observational studies, potentially indicating that behaviourally tolerant individuals are favoured in natural environments where personality traits relate directly to fitness. Together, these findings underscore the importance of ecological context and study design in interpreting personality-parasite associations. Experimental infections tend to reveal the physiological costs of infection, while observational studies highlight behavioural traits that modulate infection risk. By integrating data across host types, parasite groups, and methodological approaches, our meta-analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of how personality and infection interact. These insights contribute to a broader effort to link behavioural ecology with disease ecology, clarifying how individual variation in behaviour shapes and is shaped by host-parasite dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we hypothesize that during spatial navigation in freely moving primates, hippocampal SWRs also occur during pauses in locomotion, but coupled to exploratory gaze shifts that sample visual information to guide navigation. To evaluate this, we wirelessly recorded hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) in freely moving common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Two animals performed a visually guided foraging task in a 3D maze, navigating to reward locations using visual cues while we tracked body, head position, and gaze direction. One animal also performed a memory-guided alternation task navigating to remembered goal locations. Across 24 sessions, we detected 6,772 SWRs; notably 51.86% of events occurred within 5 seconds of the preceding SWR. The sharp wave component averaged 7.96 +- 3.74 Hz in frequency and 143.87 +- 71.87 ms in duration, while the ripple component averaged 163.7 +- 13.47 Hz and 126.07 +- 63.00 ms, respectively.

However, nestmates do not differentiate between infected and sterile injuries, providing similar treatments regardless of infection. Even though we show that early amputation correlates with higher survival rates, nestmates amputate indiscriminately on legs with fresh or old wounds. Additionally, cuticular hydrocarbon profiles differed between ants with infected or sterile wounds only 24 hours post-injury, a timepoint when amputations are no longer effective. We propose that C. maculatus workers perform prophylactic amputations regardless of injury state or age. This is in sharp contrast to previous studies which showed clear capabilities to treat infected wounds differently in ants using antimicrobial compounds.

Monitoring exercise-induced stress is therefore essential to understand racehorses responses to effort and ensuring their welfare. Stress perceived by the horse during physical activity can be measured using various indicators, including stress-related hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, and other neuromodulators such as serotonin, all involved in the stress response and its regulation. Another approach to assess physiological and emotional responses to stimuli such as exercise is through behaviours and facial movements. In this study, we aimed to 1) evaluate the changes in these three hormones following a trotting exercise, 2) determine the changes in behaviour and facial movements in response to the same exercise and 3) investigate a potential relationship between hormonal variations and specific behavioural patterns that could serve as indicators of exercise-induced stress in horses. Fourteen French Standardbred horses from two stables were monitored over one day. On the morning they performed a trotting exercise. Behaviours and facial movements were recorded via video for 2min30 both before and just after exercise. Saliva and blood samples were collected at four time points: before exercise, just after exercise, 1h post-exercise and 24h post-exercise to assess the concentration of salivary cortisol, serum concentration of adrenaline and serotonin. Results showed significant post-exercise increases in all three hormones with peak concentrations observed immediately after exercise (general mixed models, p<0.05), and elevated cortisol and adrenaline levels persisting one hour later (general mixed models, p<0.05). In terms of behaviours, horses exhibited higher frequencies of facial movements and especially mouth movements after exercise than before (MANOVA, F=5.85, p<0.01). Moreover, increases in serotonin and adrenaline concentrations were positively associated with agitation-related behaviours (pawing and head turning) and mouth movements (general linear models, p<0.01).

Understanding how nutrition supports brood rearing is crucial for developing diets that could aid against environmental threats. Nutritional research on whole colony brood development has been historically challenging due to difficulties documenting the diet's impact on brood production over time. We describe a novel semi-field method to study the influence of nutrition on brood rearing using standardised small colonies formed de novo (ca. 1500 nurse-age bees and a queen) housed in adapted mating-nucs, placed inside an enclosure and limited to feeding on chemically defined diets. Complete assessments were conducted every fifteen days, assisted by a bespoke device to photograph every frame to measure cell contents. A novel metric describes the number of bees generated per gram of diet consumed, measuring the impact of nutrition on brood rearing and overall colony size.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

There are multiple features of forager-target interactions that may generate saltatory forager movement during pursuit and/or localization of the target. Here, we explore how the reliability of the target's signal and the dependence of the forager's perception of that signal on the forager's own motion can generate a variety of different continuous and saltatory pursuit patterns in evolved model foragers with stationary targets. We use dynamical analyses of evolved forager nervous systems to show the possible mechanisms through which saltatory movement was generated and how signals influence those movements in a foraging animal. Saltatory movement during pursuit independent of signal was routinely found when the forager's perception depended on its movement. Saltatory movement patterns could also be generated in otherwise cruise-like behaviors when target signal either excited or inhibited ongoing forager movement. Additionally, the magnitude of the signal's influence was found to depend on proximity to the target during pursuit. These models present hypotheses for future empirical research and emphasize the importance of exploring variation in animal movement during different phases of foraging.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Diffusion MRI data were acquired from the cervical spinal cord of monkeys before and after a unilateral dorsal column lesion at the C5 level, using a 9.4T scanner. Parametric maps derived from DTI and SMT effectively detected regional fiber damage around 16 weeks post-injury. Post-mortem silver staining served as the ground truth for assessing region-specific fiber damage. Diffusion MRI maps aligned well with histological measures and captured the severity of WM damage at the lesioned segment (in an order of dorsal > ventral > lateral WM tracts) and along the dorsal column tract across segments (in an order of lesion center > rostral > caudal). Among the diffusion parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), axonal volume fraction (Vax), radial diffusivity (RD), and extra-axonal transverse diffusivity (Dex) showed most significant changes at and around the lesion site where severe tissue damage occurred. FA, Vax, and axial diffusivity (AD) exhibited marked changes in dorsal column proximal to the lesion center, where moderate axonal damage occurred. Additionally, AD and FA showed the greatest sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) to mild fiber disruption and demyelination in regions distal to the lesion. Overall, FA provided the highest sensitivity and specificity for detecting fiber degeneration and demyelination, while Vax demonstrated the strongest spatial correlation with histologic markers of regional fiber damage. The combination of DTI and SMT thus offers reliable biomarkers for assessing SCI.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

For example, the brain can rely on an internal model of gravity to intercept and track accelerated targets under gravity, and cues about the visual environment naturalness can facilitate its recruitment. Notably, in real life, these two tasks are often associated. Experimental evidence suggests that predictive information may be shared between the two tasks, albeit their concurrent execution can, in turn, affect the oculomotor performance. To gain further insight on how task demands and the naturalness of the visual context affect the weighting of sensory feedback and predictive feedforward information in ocular tracking, subjects tracked targets either congruent with gravity or perturbed during the trajectory with altered gravity. Targets were projected on either pictorial or neutral background, and, to enforce prediction, were occluded for variable intervals 550 ms after the perturbation. Sixty-nine participants were divided into two groups: one group performed only ocular tracking, the other also intercepted the targets. In general, subjects ocular tracking performance depended on the target acceleration level and the visual context, with effects of gravitational expectations being more evident with the pictorial naturalistic environment. This result reinforced the idea that gravity a priori information can be weighted based on the naturalness of the visual context. Another striking finding was that participants who only tracked the target showed systematic changes of the oculomotor performance with the acceleration level right after the perturbation, compatible with a strong reliance on gravitational expectation; instead, participants that also intercepted the target showed such systematic changes primarily after the targets occlusion, perhaps weighting more sensory information until then. Thus, concurrence of ocular tracking and manual interception seemingly influenced the temporal recruitment of internalized gravity information.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

ACh is released by cholinergic interneurons (CIN), which integrate diverse inputs to contextualize DA signals and shape adaptive responses. Among these inputs, we previously observed that the GPCR Smoothened (Smo) on CIN suppresses L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, a motor side-effect resulting from artificially elevated DA levels in the Parkinsonian brain. Here, we examine whether Smo signaling modulates ACh dynamics, its coordination with DA, and motor learning in the healthy brain. We find that CIN-specific Smo activity bidirectionally modulates ACh inhibition in response to both optogenetically evoked and endogenous DA. Smo relieves DA-associated ACh inhibition and permits its progressive modification with repeated DA release. These effects alter the temporal organization of ACh in the dorsolateral striatum and its coupling to DA, without affecting DA release itself. Behaviorally, Smo ablation from cholinergic neurons promotes initial motor learning at the expense of future behavioral flexibility. Together, these findings identify Smo as a bidirectional modulator of striatal DA-ACh coordination and striatal learning.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Indeed, fMRI studies have highlighted dissociable parietal regions sensitive to pointer and feature load respectively. Specifically, while the superior IPS (intraparietal sulcus) is sensitive to feature load, inferior IPS is only sensitive to the number of pointers - i.e., the number of objects. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics remain unclear, and therefore it is unknown whether these effects reflect visual working memory (VWM) formation, maintenance, or both, especially given limited temporal resolution of fMRI. In our current MEG (magnetoencephalography) study, participants memorized visual arrays with different numbers of objects (object/pointer load: two, four), as well as different features and feature-per-object (color, orientation, bifeatural) in a VWM task. We observed a dissociation between inferior and superior IPS in the temporal dynamics of feature-sensitive and pointer-sensitive responses. While pointer-sensitive signals persisted across VWM formation and maintenance in inferior IPS, feature-sensitivity was only transiently manifested during VWM formation in superior IPS. This spatiotemporal dissociation may reflect a representational architecture optimized for efficiency, reducing the need for sustained neural activity to maintain features once they are bound to pointers. In revealing the spatiotemporal profile of pointer and feature representations, our results provide novel evidence on how pointers underlie energy-efficient neural representations in VWM.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Here we examine the contributions of direct callosal connections between left and right PRR to bimanual coordination. Using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, we traced callosal pathways crossing the midline and found that PRR-PRR connections are restricted to the splenium. We then temporarily blocked these fibers with lidocaine while measuring behavioral performance and interhemispheric coherence. Blockade reduced task-specific PRR-PRR coherence during bimanual movements. Behaviorally, blockade sped movement initiation across tasks, consistent with an inhibitory role of interhemispheric communication, reduced the temporal synchrony of bimanual movements to a common target and reduced errors for bimanual movements to separate targets.

Although prior studies have shown that appropriate postural control supports both task success and postural balance during quiet standing or under modest postural demands, it remains unclear how the central nervous system controls whole-body posture under high-demand, near-fall conditions. Here, we investigated how varying postural demands influence postural strategies using a whole-body task in which participants leaned their body mediolaterally to reach a target. We manipulated the required leaning angles and velocities by varying target positions and time constraints to reach a target, thereby introducing different levels of postural demand. The results demonstrated that target position, time constraint, and movement distance significantly affected task performance, defined as reaching accuracy. Specifically, participants could accurately reach targets requiring upright or moderately leaning postures. However, when targets required greater leaning postures, participants failed to reach them. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of shorter time constraints and longer movement distances on task performance became more pronounced when target positions required greater leaning postures. These findings suggest that the central nervous system tolerates low to moderate postural demands to achieve task goals. In contrast, when postural demands exceed a certain threshold, the central nervous system begins to prioritize postural safety over task success.

Although clinical studies have suggested advantages of RETS transfer for upper extremity repairs, uncertainties remain regarding its underlying mechanism. Furthermore, our recent clinical studies using electrophysiological examinations revealed no contribution from the donor nerve. Given that most experimental studies were conducted on acutely injured nerves, our objective is to reassess the effectiveness of reverse end-to-side nerve transfer in a model of chronic nerve injury and repair. Methods Obturator and femoral nerve were used as donor and recipient nerves, respectively. Electromyogram (EMG), retrograde labeling of regenerated motoneurons and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation were used to compare regenerative ability of donor nerve in acute and delayed RETS transfer where the femoral nerve in the latter group was injured 8 weeks prior. Nerve- babysitting effect on injured nerve was investigated by 1) no intervention; 2) perineurial window creation; and 3) RETS transfer to femoral nerve in delayed repair model. The effects of availability of regeneration tracks, i.e. bands of bungner, were investigated by severing proximal femoral nerve with subsequent acute and delayed repairs. Results EMG and motoneuron quantification confirmed inferiority of donor nerve regeneration into recipient nerve in delayed RETS transfer compared to acute repair, yet donor axons reached target muscle and formed NMJs in both conditions. Same functional assessments revealed nerve baby-sitting effects did not significantly contribute to repair success but availability of regeneration tracks in the recipient nerve may influence the final outcomes.

However, it is still unclear whether reaching performance toward auditory and proprioceptive targets is modality-specific and whether performance improves under multisensory compared to unisensory conditions. Here, we addressed these questions by measuring reaching performance toward auditory, proprioceptive, and combined audio-proprioceptive targets. Accuracy was generally similar across conditions, but precision was lower for auditory targets compared to proprioceptive and audio-proprioceptive targets. A second experiment investigated whether providing additional proprioceptive information while reaching for an auditory target could improve precision in subsequent auditory-only trials. A slight improvement was observed, indicating that proprioceptive cues may help reduce spatial variability in auditory-guided actions, though not to the level seen in the multisensory condition. Overall, the results suggest that while the target modality slightly impacts movement accuracy, it has a significant impact on movement precision, with proprioceptive input playing a crucial role in enhancing precision.

Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) demonstrates remarkable tropism for motor neurons (MNs) and represents an exciting candidate to target genetic causes of motor neuron diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, systemic delivery risks immunogenicity and off-target effects, therefore localised delivery to the CNS is advantageous. New method: We assessed MN transduction in wild-type mice using AAV9-controlled, cytomegalovirus-promoter driven, enhanced GFP expression. Intra-cisterna magna (ICM) and intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) methods were compared. Four weeks post-delivery, GFP positivity in MN and astrocytes were quantified via immunohistochemical approaches and viral genome copy number determined by qPCR. Results: All delivery methods achieved high MN transduction in lumbar spinal cord (>68%). Unilateral ICV delivery provided the highest and most consistent levels (89 {+/-} 3%), and minimal peripheral viral copies. ICV delivery resulted in higher astrocytic transduction, most notably in the cortex. Brainstem MN transduction was high with all methods (>55%). We failed to find evidence of neuronal transduction in motor cortex. Viral genome copies trended higher in spinal cord and brainstem with ICV approaches, however further work is required to understand how bilateral delivery leads to such profound increases. Comparison to existing methods: Whilst several routes of administration into cerebrospinal fluid exist, direct comparisons for targeting MNs in vivo remain limited.

M.; Bergles, D. E.", "abstract": "The parsing of sensory information into discrete topographic domains is a fundamental principle of sensory processing. In the auditory cortex, these domains evolve during a stimulus, with the onset and offset of tones evoking distinct spatial patterns of neural activity. However, it is not known where in the auditory system this spatial segregation occurs or how these dynamics are affected by hearing loss. Using widefield single photon neuronal Ca2+ imaging in the inferior colliculus (IC) of awake mice, we found that pure tone stimuli elicited both spatially constrained neural activity within isofrequency bands and simultaneous sideband suppression. At cessation of the stimulus, offset responses emerged within the region of sideband suppression, demonstrating that simple stimuli elicit spatiotemporally distinct neural activity patterns to represent the presence of sound and sound termination. Because sound frequency is spatially encoded in the IC, this spatial shift creates a tonotopically distinct offset (tdOFF) response relative to sound onset. Two-photon Ca2+ imaging confirmed that tdOFF neuron activity in the sideband region was suppressed during sound and elevated above baseline after stimulus termination, raising the possibility that rebound excitation could contribute to this post-stimulus activation. Loud noise exposure, a common model of hearing loss, abolished both sideband suppression and tdOFF responses. These results show that hearing loss profoundly reshapes the spatiotemporal pattern of sound processing by altering sideband activity. This preferential loss of sideband suppression and tdOFF activation after sound-induced injury in the auditory midbrain may contribute to hyperacusis and tinnitus by promoting neuronal hyperactivity.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

In this study, we derive a novel boundary condition that accounts for finite receptor kinetics, receptor density, and bidirectional transport across the BBB. Specifically, we develop a nonlinear homogenized boundary condition that ensures mass conservation and incorporates receptor-mediated Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We then implement this boundary condition in a cylindrical geometry representing a capillary surrounded by brain tissue. After verifying that the model matches an analytical steady state solution that we derive and that it yields realistic blood A{beta} concentrations, we explore how realistic variations in parameter values drive changes in both steady state A{beta} concentration and transient dynamics. Simulations and analytical results reveal that A{beta} concentrations in the brain are sensitive to receptor number ratios, while concentrations in the blood are primarily affected by the blood clearance rate. Additionally, we use the model to investigate A{beta} clearance during sequential sleep cycles and due to a pathological phenomenon, spreading depolarization.

To uncover the downstream circuitry, we identified the NPF receptor NPFR and the neurons it is expressed in as being acutely critical for thirsty water seeking. Refinement of the NPFR pattern uncovered a role for a single neuron, the L1-l, in promoting thirsty water seeking. The L1-l neuron increases its activity in thirsty flies and is involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neurons in long-term memory formation. Thus, NPFR and its ligand NPF, already known for its role in feeding behavior, are also important for a second ingestive behavior.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Previous computational work on this disorder has focused on the myocardium, ignoring the effects of TS on neural development and its strong association with autism spectrum disorder. Variation in the TS-causative gene, CACNA1C, is indeed also associated with a variety of complex neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We apply computational methods, drawing on experimental data, to understand the mechanisms of calcium dysregulation in TS, and validate our findings in four well-established multi-compartmental neuronal models. CACNA1C encodes the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, Cav1.2, which modulates neuronal excitability and several activity-dependent pathways. We investigate two mutations in CACNA1C causative of TS type II, G402R and G406R. Both variants show a loss of voltage-dependent inactivation and changes in their voltage dependence of activation. We incorporate the altered steady-state activity of these variants with additional morphological data indicating a significant increase in activity-dependent dendritic retraction of layer II/III pyramidal cells in TS mutant neurones. Our findings replicate experimental work suggesting that increased calcium flux reduces firing frequency but does not affect the rheobase current for action potential initiation. Furthermore, models expressing dendritic Cav1.2 current show altered apical-somatic signal integration in mutant neurones. All models with shortened dendrite morphology show hyperexcitability, denoted by reduced rheobase current and increased responsiveness to current injection compared to their full-length counterparts. Importantly, our approach identifies robust and testable predictions on the impacts of TS on single-cell dynamics. We also discuss the broader implications of our findings for other calcium channel-related neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

While prior work has shown that tool use alters body representation, little is known about how artificial augmentations alter body representations as they are worn and used. Here, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built exoskeletal device that extended users' fingers by 10 cm. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after exoskeleton wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, simply wearing the exoskeleton led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, following active use, both biological and artificial finger representations expanded significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a lasting aftereffect on biological finger representation was observed even after device removal. Our findings demonstrate that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into the body representation, with dynamic adjustments in proprioceptive space shaped by both structural and functional properties of the device. This work advances our understanding of how the sensorimotor system accommodates artificial extensions and highlights the potential for body-augmenting technologies to be intuitively integrated into body representation.

Characterization of spatiotemporal changes in these processes will help elucidate their role in ischemic neuronal injury as an initial step towards developing targeted interventions. Methods: HI was induced in post-natal day 9 mice using the modified-Vannucci model. Hippocampal tissue from ipsilateral HI exposed, contralateral hypoxia exposed and sham animals was collected at 6h, 24h, 72h and 7d post-HI. Tissue was subsequently evaluated for markers of cell death (TUNEL), intracellular iron changes (FerroOrange, fluorescent in situ and immunofluorescence), and lipid peroxidation (real time PCR, Gpx4 immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry). Mass spectrometry measured isoprostanes (15-F2t-IsoP) and neuroprostanes (4-F4t-NP) as lipid peroxidation markers of arachidonic (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), respectively. Results: Compared to sham, the HI hippocampus showed increased intracellular labile iron levels that was maximal at 6h post-HI with subsequent elevation in only neuroprostanes at 24h post-HI. TUNEL labeling peaked at 24h post-HI. At 72h, labile iron levels and lipid peroxidation declined corresponding with peak infiltration of ferritin positive microglia/macrophages and the start of TUNEL staining decline. In addition, surviving neurons had increased expression of Gpx4 peaking at 72h post-HI that normalized by 7d post-HI. Conclusions: These findings suggest that following HI, an acute increase in labile iron and DHA peroxidation are correlated with markers of cell death that peak at 24h post-HI. Microglial/macrophage iron sequestration and neuronal antioxidant responses may ameliorate further injury and represent targets for neuroprotective therapies.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Traditional fNIRS-based hyperscanning suffers shortcomings like low spatial resolution and high susceptibility to superficial interference, causing imprecise estimation of IBS in complex social tasks. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap by comprehensively assessing how high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), an enhanced alternative to fNIRS, can benefit hyperscanning studies of complex social interactions. Sixteen dyads were engaged in both collaborative and individual tangram puzzle tasks, and their brain activities were recorded simultaneously using HD-DOT and fNIRS. We found that HD-DOT demonstrated significantly stronger IBS and identified more brain regions with significant IBS compared to fNIRS during the collaborative task. Specifically, while fNIRS detected IBS only in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and supramarginal gyrus (SMG), HD-DOT revealed additional IBS in the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Additionally, compared to the individual task, the collaborative task showed increased IBS in HD-DOT, not only in the DLPFC but also in the SMG, frontal eye fields (FEF), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). By highlighting the superior spatial resolution and sensitivity of HD-DOT in capturing detailed and extensive neural activity during complex social interactions, our findings for the first time clarified the potential strengths of HD-DOT in measuring IBS over traditional fNIRS.

Whether and how CRTC1 and CREB1 interact with other transcription factors to regulate activity-dependent transcription, and what the role of CRTC1 is in neurons beyond the activation of CREB1 regulated transcription, remains unknown. To address these questions in an unbiased manner, we used proximity labeling to identify CRTC1-proximal proteins in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of rodent forebrain neurons. The cytoplasmic CRTC1 proxisome included a variety of signaling pathways and downstream cellular processes involved in synaptic plasticity. In contrast, the nuclear CRTC1 proxisome included transcription factors that mediate activity-dependent transcription, chromatin factors, and splicing factors. Our data revealed that CRTC1 and CREB1 interact with MEF2C and RFX3 transcription factors in an activity-dependent manner. Thus, in chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments, CREB1 was prebound to chromatin regions containing bZIP motifs in a manner that was unchanged by neuronal activity, while glutamatergic stimulation triggered the recruitment of CRTC1 and CREB1 to activity-dependent enhancers enriched in motifs for MEF2C and RFX3.

Most classic neural encoding models and current brain-computer interface decoders assume individual neurons sum together along a neural dimension to represent movement features such as velocity or force. However, large population neural analyses continue to identify trajectories of neural activity evolving with time that traverse multiple dimensions. Explanations for these neural trajectories typically focus on how cortical circuits processes learn, organize, and implement movements. However, descriptions of how these neural trajectories might improve performance, and specifically motor precision, are lacking. In this study, we proposed and tested a computational model that highlights the role of neural trajectories, through the selective co-activation and selective timing of firing rates across the neural populations, for improving motor precision. Our model uses experimental results from a center-out reaching task as inspiration to create several physiologically realistic models for the neural encoding of movement. Using a recurrent neural network to simulate how a downstream population of neurons might receive such information, like the spinal cord and motor units, we show that movements are more accurate when neural information specific to the phase and/or amplitude of movement are incorporated across time instead of an instantaneous, velocity-only tuning model. Our finding suggests that precise motor control arises from spatiotemporal recruitment of neural populations that create distinct neural trajectories. We anticipate our results will significantly impact not only how neural encoding of movement in motor cortex is described but also future understating for how brain networks communicate information for planning and executing movements. Our model also provides potential inspiration for how to incorporate selective activation across a neural population to improve future brain-computer interfaces.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

However, existing computational tools often oversimplify neurons as mere nodes in a graph, disregarding their intricate morphologies.

This gene encodes the olf heterotrimeric G protein subunit, which, together with {beta}2{gamma}7 subunits, mediates the stimulatory coupling of dopamine D1 and adenosine A2A receptors to adenylyl-cyclase. These receptors are expressed in distinct striatal projection neurons (SPNs) with complementary functions on motor behavior. To dissect the specific roles of Golf in each subpopulation of SPNs, we generated and characterized mouse models in which Gnal was conditionally deleted in neurons expressing either D1 receptors (D1-SPNs) or A2A receptors (A2A-SPNs). Our results confirmed the critical role of Golf in regulating adenylyl-cyclase 5 and its coupling with D1 and A2A receptors. Mice with a selective loss of Golf in D1-SPNs showed nocturnal hyperactivity, deficits in motor performances, but no overt abnormal movements or generalized motor disability. Our experiments also revealed that Golf in D1-SPNs is not systematically required for locomotor responses induced by D1 agonists or psychostimulants. Selective loss of Golf in A2A-SPNs did not affect motor abilities nor learning.

This study aimed to evaluate whether multiparametric MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT), and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), can sensitively detect structural and biochemical changes in the intact spinal cord following a focal dorsal nerve root section in a non-human primate model. Methods: In four squirrel monkeys, unilateral dorsal nerve roots at cervical segments C4 and C5 were surgically transected. MRI data were collected using a 9.4 T scanner with a custom saddle-shaped transmit-receive quadrature coil before and one week after lesioning. DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD); qMT-derived pool size ratio (PSR); and CEST and nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) effects were quantified across seven regions of interest. CEST and NOE effects were extracted using five-pool Lorentzian fitting of Z-spectra. Results: At the lesioned dorsal nerve root bundles, FA, PSR, and NOE(-1.6 ppm) values decreased, while RD and CEST(3.5 ppm) increased, consistent with fiber degeneration, demyelination, and inflammation. Similar, though less pronounced, changes were observed in the dorsal root entry zone, particularly within the first week post-lesion. Conclusion: Multiparametric MRI enables region-specific detection of early spinal cord pathology as soon as one week following dorsal nerve root injury.

In parallel, place cells in the hippocampus (HC) fire at spatially confined locations, with selectivity tuned not only to allocentric position but also to environmental contexts, such as sensory cues. Although grid and place cells both encode spatial information and support memory for multiple locations, why animals maintain two such representations remains unclear. Noting that place representations seem to have other functional roles in intrinsically motivated tasks such as recalling locations from sensory cues, we propose that animals maintain grid and place representations together to support planning. Specifically, we posit that place cells auto-associate not only sensory information relayed from the MEC but also grid cell patterns, enabling recall of goal location grid patterns from sensory and motivational cues, permitting subsequent planning with only grid representations. We extend a previous theoretical framework for grid-cell-based planning and show that local transition rules can generalize to long-distance path forecasting. We further show that a planning network can sequentially update grid cell states toward the goal. During this process, intermediate grid activity can trigger place cell pattern completion, reconstructing experiences along the planned path. We demonstrate all these effects using a single-layer RNN that simultaneously models the HC-MEC loop and the planning subnetwork. We show that such recurrent mechanisms for grid cell-based planning, with goal recall driven by the place system, make several characteristic, testable predictions.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Using a perceptual target-detection task across auditory and visual domains in laboratory and online samples, we applied hierarchical drift diffusion modelling to examine how prior probabilities shape evidence accumulation in clinical and non-clinical populations. We show that in healthy individuals, prior information enhances sensory gain and decision flexibility, as represented by drift criterion and rate, consistent with the gain model. In contrast, individuals with psychosis exhibit diminished sensory gain, relying instead on pre-evidence biases, consistent with the origin model. Notably, greater positive symptom severity predicted a reduction in traditional criterion decision bias. These results suggest that sensory gain deficits may serve as a computational marker for psychosis progression, linking dysfunctional prior use to perceptual aberrancies.

Here, we harnessed two novel approaches to determine how these factors contribute to prefrontal and striatal ramping activity in mice performing an interval timing task. First, to determine how movement contributes to ramping activity, we tracked movement velocity using DeepLabCut as well as task-specific movements while recording prefrontal or striatal ensembles during interval timing. We found that time was more accurately decoded by ramping neurons than movement-modulated neurons, with the exception of prefrontal velocity-modulated neurons. Second, to disambiguate temporal signals from anticipatory reward signals we compared activity patterns in neurons that were recorded during interval timing to the same neurons recorded during a Pavlovian conditioning task. We found more ramping activity and more accurate temporal decoding by neuronal ensembles during interval timing compared to Pavlovian conditioning. Together, these data quantify contributions of time estimation, movement, and reward anticipation in prefrontal and striatal ensembles, and they suggest that ramping is a cognitive signal that estimates time.

Yet, how distinct facets of this variability evolve from childhood to older adulthood remains poorly understood, limiting mechanistic models of neurocognitive aging. Here, we characterize lifespan neural variability using an integrated empirical-computational approach. We analyzed high-density EEG cohort data spanning 111 healthy individuals aged 9-75 years, recorded at rest and during passive and attended auditory oddball stimulation task. We extracted scale-dependent measures of EEG fluctuations amplitude and entropy, together with millisecond-resolved phase-synchrony networks in the 2-20 Hz range. Multi-condition partial least squares decomposition analysis revealed two independent lifespan trajectories. First, slow-frequency power, variance and complexity at longer timescales declined monotonically with age, indicating a progressive dampening of low-frequency fluctuations and large-scale coherence. Second, the temporal organization of phase-synchrony reconfigurations followed an inverted U-trend: young adults exhibited the slowest yet most diverse switching--characterized by low mean but high variance and low kurtosis of jump lengths at 2-6 Hz and the opposite pattern at 8-20 Hz--whereas children and older adults showed faster, more stereotyped dynamics. To mechanistically account for these patterns, we fitted a ten-node phase-oscillator model constrained by the human structural connectome. Only an intermediate, metastable coupling regime reproduced the empirical combination of reduced low-frequency variability and maximally heterogeneous synchrony dynamics observed in young adults, while deviations toward weaker or stronger coupling mimicked the childrens and older adults profiles. Our results demonstrate that development and aging entail changes in the switching dynamics of EEG phase synchronization, by differentially sculpting stationary and transient aspects of neural variability.

During this window, the processing and perception of stimulus are influenced not only by preceding and current information, but also by input that follows the presentation of the stimulus. To date, the computational mechanisms underlying crossmodal backward processing, which we refer to as crossmodal postdiction, are not well understood. In this study, we examined crossmodal postdiction in the audiovisual (AV) rabbit illusion, in which postdiction occurs when flash-beep pairs are presented shortly before and shortly after a single flash or a single beep. We collected behavioral data from 32 human participants and fitted four competing models: a Bayesian causal inference (BCI) model, a forced-fusion (FF) model, forced-segregation (FS) model, and a non-postdictive BCI (BCI-NP) model. The BCI model fit the data well and outperformed the other models. Building on previous findings demonstrating causal inference during non-postdictive multisensory integration, our study shows that the BCI framework is also an effective means of explaining crossmodal postdiction. Observers accumulate causal evidence that can retroactively influence the crossmodal perception of preceding sensory stimuli following the causal decision. Our study demonstrates that the AV rabbit illusion forms within a temporal window of multisensory integration that encompasses past, present, and future sensory inputs, and that this integration can be effectively explained by the Bayesian causal inference framework.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed between-subject multivariate decoding of hyperaligned functional data obtained with high-field (7 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging to characterize the universal neural codes underlying the training and transfer effects, and compared their resultant motor engrams in the sensorimotor cortex. We found that both learning mechanisms have reliable neural representations that are shared across individual brains, highlighting similar representational geometry despite idiosyncratic functional topographies. While their codes are embedded in overlapping cortical areas, the training effect has a more stable representation centered in the primary sensorimotor cortex, indicative of execution-level learning.

Moreover, the resultant cortical engrams shaped by them are particularly distinct in the left inferior part of the precentral sulcus, and in the right side of the superior part of the precentral sulcus, postcentral gyrus and postcentral sulcus.

While the neurophysiology literature offers detailed insights into the neural underpinnings of sustained attention, there remains considerable uncertainty on how attention switching takes place. In this study, using EEG recordings from normal-hearing adults in an immersive multi-talker environment, we measured the neural encoding of two competing speech streams amid background babble. Participants were cued to switch attention between streams every 15-30 seconds. Neural tracking was assessed via Temporal Response Functions (TRF), confirming reliable decoding of attentional focus. Our results indicate asymmetric disengagement and engagement processes during attention switches, where the neural tracking of the new target stream emerges before disengaging from the previous target, revealing a transient simultaneous encoding of two speech streams. That transition was closely mirrored by a reduction in EEG alpha power, informing on the cognitive effort during different phases of the attention switch. We then isolated cortical activity reflecting lexical prediction mechanisms to determine how lexical context is updated after an attention switch, comparing four numerical hypotheses that were constructed using Large Language Models. Our findings elucidate both the temporal and contextual mechanisms underlying auditory attention shifts, pointing to the possibility that listeners carry out a reset in lexical context after switching attention.

While the scaffolding protein Piccolo is known for its role at synapses, its function in astrocytes and contribution to neurodegenerative disorders like Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3 (PCH3) are largely unknown. Understanding these mechanisms is key to elucidating PCH3 pathology. Methods: We used a multi-faceted approach with a Pclogt/gt rat model. Methods included RNA-sequencing for gene expression and GO analysis. Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry assessed Piccolo localization, ECM component (Brevican [Bcan], Tenascin-R [TNR]) levels, distribution, and secretion in brain sections and primary astrocytes. Golgi morphology was evaluated via GM130 staining. Neuronal network formation and function were investigated by co-culturing wild-type neurons with Pclowt/wt or Pclogt/gt astrocytes in a Banker setup, assessing synapse density (immunostaining, RRP electrophysiology) and spontaneous activity (mEPSCs, mIPSCs). Astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) experiments determined secreted factor roles. Results: RNA-seq showed significant DEG increases in older versus young Pclogt/gt rats (P25 vs. P5), which were strongly enriched in cell communication, signaling, and ECM GO terms. We identified a novel astrocyte-specific Piccolo isoform that partially localizes at the Golgi. Piccolo gene trap transposon mutation led to impaired ECM secretion (reduced extracellular Bcan, altered TNR) from astrocytes, correlating with a fragmented Golgi in Pclogt/gt astrocytes. Functionally, Pclogt/gt astrocytes significantly reduced synapse density and altered intrinsic activity (increased mEPSC frequency) in neuronal networks. This synaptic deficit was substantially rescued by Pclowt/wt astrocyte conditioned media (ACM). Conclusion: Our findings reveal a critical, unrecognized role for Piccolo in regulating astrocytic ECM secretion, essential for proper neuronal network formation and activity. Astrocytic Piccolo dysfunction disrupts this process, causing impaired synaptogenesis and altered intrinsic network activity, providing a novel cellular and molecular mechanism for neurodegenerative diseases like PCH3 and highlights astrocytes as potential therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

AxoMetric automatically identifies and traces regenerated axons, generating quantitative measurements that closely match conventional manual quantification but with significantly greater speed. Key features include length-dependent axon quantification at defined intervals from the injury site and normalization of axon density to nerve diameter to account for anatomical variability. To facilitate high-throughput analysis, the software includes an image queuing function. Additional features of AxoMetric allow quantification of a range of labeled cellular structures. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate accurate quantification of regenerated axons in the optic nerve, retinal ganglion cells density in retinal flat-mounts, and regenerated axon bundles in injured sciatic nerves.

While prior studies using RNA interference suggested that Ptbp1 loss promotes neurogenesis, recent genetic studies have failed to replicate glia-to-neuron conversion following Ptbp1 loss of function. To evaluate the role of Ptbp1 in developmental neurogenesis in vivo, we conditionally disrupted Ptbp1 in retinal progenitors. Ptbp1 was robustly expressed in both retinal progenitors and Muller glia but absent from postmitotic neurons, and efficient loss of function in mutant animals was confirmed using immunostaining for Ptbp1. Furthermore, bulk RNA-Seq at E16 revealed accelerated expression of late-stage progenitor and photoreceptor-specific genes and altered splicing patterns in Ptbp1 mutants, including increased inclusion of rod photoreceptor-specific exons. However, we observed no defects in retinal lamination, progenitor proliferation, or cell fate specification in mature retina. ScRNA-Seq of mature mutant retinas revealed only modest transcriptional changes which partially recapitulate alterations seen following selective deletion of Ptbp1 in mature glia.

M.; Koirala, J.; Stacy, A.", "abstract": "Oral microbiota are increasingly implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases beyond the mouth, including bronchiectasis, a condition marked by persistent airway inflammation, mucus accumulation, and limited therapeutic options. Among these microbes, commensal Neisseria, typically considered health-associated in the upper airway, are emerging as opportunistic colonists of the inflamed lower airway. However, mechanisms supporting their persistence in this hostile environment, characterized by antibiotic pressure, nutrient limitation, and interspecies competition, remain poorly defined. Here, we show that the prevalent oral commensal Neisseria mucosa exhibits markedly enhanced antibiotic resistance and anoxic growth in a synthetic medium (SCFM2) that mimics sputum from individuals with bronchiectasis. Using genome-wide transposon sequencing (Tn-seq), we identified key genetic determinants of N. mucosa fitness, including pathways for L-lactate catabolism and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Notably, nitrate respiration was also essential for growth, linking use of this inflammation-associated electron acceptor to fitness under oxygen-limited, sputum-like conditions. Loss of nitrate reductase impaired anoxic L-lactate catabolism, reduced competitive fitness against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and abrogated growth in SCFM2, as well as human saliva--a relevant, nitrate-rich nutrient source in the oral cavity. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of nitrate reductase using tungstate suppressed growth of both N. mucosa and P. aeruginosa in SCFM2, but not in standard media, revealing a context-specific metabolic vulnerability of nitrate-respiring airway pathogens. These findings suggest that inflammation-compatible traits like nitrate respiration, while supporting oral commensalism, may also drive opportunistic expansion in the inflamed airway. Targeting such pathways could offer a non-antibiotic approach to limit oral bacterial persistence in bronchiectasis and other chronic diseases.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Although intra-host genomic variation of H. influenzae has been investigated in some anatomic sites, the genes most frequently acquiring nonsynonymous (amino acid changing) or nonsense (protein truncating) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) during human carriage or infection remain largely unidentified. To study intra-host genomic variation of H. influenzae during human asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx, the genomes of 805 isolates recovered from 24 healthy Icelandic children were sequenced. Most children were colonized with isolates with a single multilocus sequence type (MLST), although some were concurrently colonized with isolates with multiple MLSTs. Intra-host genomic variation was discovered with 120 genes acquiring SNPs in at least one isolate. Among them, 69 genes were recurrently polymorphic in isolates recovered from multiple children, and 72 SNPs occurred in multiple isolates recovered from the same child. The polymorphic genes encode proteins with diverse inferred functions, including transcription regulators and putative virulence factors. Many of the proteins likely play roles in bacterial fitness, virulence, and host-pathogen molecular interactions.

However, the impact of translocation on microbiomes is often overlooked, limiting our ability to assess how laboratory findings relate to field dynamics. It's also crucial to examine organism responses with symbionts, as they can stabilise communities or increase vulnerability to changes. This study investigates the effects of laboratory introduction on host-microbiome interactions in the parasitic wasp Asobara japonica and its endosymbiont Wolbachia. Results indicate that transferring Wolbachia-infected (asexual) and uninfected (sexual) wasps to a laboratory decreased A. japonica's bacterial diversity. Stochastic processes drive community changes, with distinct alterations in bacterial composition between reproductive modes. Over four generations, asexual wasps' bacterial communities became more uniform, while sexual wasps showed greater diversity. Notably, bacterial changes appeared across generations rather than immediately. Additionally, Wolbachia abundance changed following laboratory introduction, affecting community structure and assembly. In conclusion, our research demonstrates how laboratory conditions affect host-associated microbial communities depending on symbiont presence. This, in turn, can affect their functions, host interactions, and overall community dynamics. Thus, our findings stress the importance of linking lab results to real-world implications, posing a broader challenge for researchers.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

As apicomplexans are prolific parasites of animals, including humans, their adaptation to parasitism from algal ancestors has garnered significant interest, and chromerids were instrumental in elucidating that evolution [2-5]. But the chromerids were also the first new algal group discovered in 100 years [2], and because so much attention has focused on comparisons with apicomplexans, the ecology of chromerid algae has remained surprisingly mysterious. They have predominately been considered to live only in association with corals, initially as intracellular coral symbionts. To test for a wider distribution of chromerids in nature, we have used plastid metagenomic binning combined with re-analysis of 18S rRNA metabarcoding data, which both support an expanded biogeographic range and ecological niche of chromerid algae by showing they are consistent associates of modern microbialites across the globe. Specifically, a broad and undescribed diversity of chromerid lineages is found in marine and also freshwater microbialites. This includes the recovery of a near-complete V. brassicaformis plastid genome and a second incomplete plastid genome from a new chromerid lineage from Highborne Cay thrombolites.

This lifestyle of bacteria is especially relevant during its pathogenesis, as observed in the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections of immunocompromised patients. However, pico- to nanomolar concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) have been shown to be efficient in triggering P. aeruginosa to disperse from biofilms, suggesting that a combination of NO exposure and antibiotic treatment may help in mitigating infections. In P. aeruginosa, the NosP-NahK two component system, which comprises a NO sensing hemoprotein, NosP, and its associated hybrid histidine kinase, NahK, has been proven to be necessary for NO mediated biofilm dispersal. NahK also has additional roles in biofilm formation, motility, denitrification and virulence, due to its regulation of a global post-transcriptional regulator RsmA. Here, we uncover a novel role of NahK in enhancing the resistance of P. aeruginosa to signaling concentrations of NO. Deletion of nahK sensitizes the strain to nanomolar levels of NO, resulting in DNA damage. Consequently, the SOS stress response pathway is induced, which causes phenotypes such as cell filamentation and cell clustering due to lysis-mediated release of extracellular DNA. Our data also indicate that increased susceptibility of the {Delta}nahK strain to NO is due to the antagonization of RsmA, and is restricted to amino acid starved media, suggesting that NahK may also have previously unappreciated roles in modulating amino acid metabolism.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

The halophilic archaeon Haloferax mediterranei is a promising PHA producer with many competitive advantages, mostly linked to its extremophilic lifestyle. The PHA synthesis enzymes of H. mediterranei have been investigated, the most important one being a class III PHA synthase consisting of two subunits (PhaCHme and PhaEHme). Three additional phaC paralogs (phaC1, phaC2 and phaC3) were found in the genome sequence and were previously described as cryptic genes. In this study, we investigate these genes in greater detail. Through a targeted bioinformatics pipeline, we unravel the diversity of PHA synthases in Halobacteriales, which highlights the unique traits of H. mediterranei. Additionally, we investigated native gene expression patterns of the paralogs in different conditions relevant to PHA production: a high-growth condition, a low-growth condition and a condition in which the monomeric PHA composition is altered by feeding valeric acid. RT-qPCR assays revealed that the three phaC paralogs were actively transcribed and regulated under different nutritional conditions, contradicting the previous observations of the genes having a cryptic nature. The regulation of the paralogs seems to be independent on the monomeric composition of the produced polymers, but dependent on the growth phase. This suggests that all paralogs might play a role in the native PHA metabolism of H. mediterranei. Finally, we hypothesize about the potential functions of the paralogs and open new avenues for future characterization efforts towards the engineering of tailor-made PHAs.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Orally administered octenidine-containing lozenges offer a topical alternative, but their effects on the host microbiota of the oral cavity, throat, and intestine remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm in vitro activity of octenidine lozenges against 106 microbial strains, including pathogens and commensals from the oral cavity, pharynx, and large intestine. Minimal biocidal concentrations (MBCs) and minimal biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) were determined under physiologically relevant exposure times: 23 minutes for oral contact and 24 hours for intestinal transit. At concentrations achievable in saliva and the intestinal lumen, octenidine effectively eradicated all oropharyngeal pathogens while leaving intestinal commensals unaffected. Its impact on oral commensals resembled that of routine mechanical cleaning.

Here, we use 16S amplicon metabarcoding of the V4 hypervariable region to provide baseline information on taxonomic and inferred functional variation in the prokaryotic (Archaea and Eubacteria) assemblies of oral and gut microbiomes of urban long-tailed macaques in Singapore. Oral microbiomes showed the most pronounced community structure at lower taxonomic levels, particularly ASVs. Gut microbiomes, in contrast, showed the most pronounced community structure at higher taxonomic levels, particularly phyla. Gut microbiomes showed clear groupings based on relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Gut microbiome community composition was almost entirely explained by the Proteobacteria:Firmicutes ratio and this metric explained twice as much inferred functional variation as the more traditional Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio. Archaeal communities in both oral and gut communities were dominated by methanogens. These were the only archaea found in the gut, but ammonia-oxidizing archaea were consistent constituents of oral microbiome assemblies as well.

However, high-throughput multi-strain reconstructions of GSMMs are still challenging: reference-based methods inherit curated information while missing new contents; alternatively, (universe-based) reference-free methods could cover strain-specific reactions, but they disregard curated information. Ideally, references should be curated pan-GSMMs for species (or genus), but their reconstruction is extremely demanding, making them still rare in literature. Here Gempipe is presented, a computational tool streamlining the multi-strain reconstruction and analysis of GSMMs, going through the production of a pan-GSMM. Its reconstruction method is hybrid, as an optional reference GSMM is automatically expanded with extra reactions taken from a reference-free reconstruction. Gempipe also downloads, filters and annotates genomes; performs in-depth gene recovery; annotates models' contents; predicts strain-specific capabilities. The companion programming interface includes functions ranging from the (pan-)GSMMs' curation to the multi-strain analysis. Gempipe was validated using multi-strain datasets, showing improved accuracy when compared with state-of-the-art tools. Moreover, metabolic diversities within Limosilactobacillus reuteri were explored, grouping strains into metabolically coherent clusters and systematically predicting health-related metabolites' biosynthesis. IMPORTANCE Available GSMM reconstruction tools present major limitations in the context of multi-strain modeling. Gempipe surpasses these limitations by implementing a novel, hybrid reconstruction strategy. Not only it produces more accurate strain-specific GSMMs, but also pan-GSMMs when the only available reference is a manually curated model for a single strain, which is currently the most common case. With the vast availability of genome sequences, the high-throughput, multi-strain GSMM reconstruction and analysis approach provided by Gempipe will facilitate large-scale studies of the exploration and bioprospecting of strain-level bacterial metabolic diversity, moving a step forward in strains' screening and rational selection.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

The implications of collective dispersal for viral infectivity and evolution remain incompletely defined. Here, we used mammalian orthoreovirus to evaluate the impact of aggregation on the propagation of infection and the generation of viral diversity through reassortment. Aggregation of free virions was induced by manipulating pH and ionic conditions. This treatment promoted coordinated delivery of viruses to cells, increasing the number of virions per infected cell and number of virions per occupied endosome at early times of infection. Likely due to a consolidation of infectious units, aggregation concomitantly reduced the overall infectivity of the viral population and progeny virus yields. When viral populations comprised two genetically distinct viruses, aggregation increased the frequency of mixed infection and of genetic exchange through reassortment. Thus, the formation of collective infectious units lowers the replicative potential of mammalian orthoreovirus populations but increases viral evolutionary potential by promoting genetic diversification.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated adherence to Menzerath's law in the vocal communication of carrion crows, Corvus corone corone, hooded crows, Corvus corone cornix and hybrids. Our findings show that crow call sequences adhere to Menzerath's law, with shorter calls occurring in longer sequences, demonstrating structural efficiency in vocal communication.

Interestingly, adherence to Menzerath's law was stronger in males and younger individuals, while no effects were found for group size, dominance, or affiliative relationships. This study provides the first evidence of Menzerath's law in corvid vocal communication and suggests that individual-level traits, rather than broader social dynamics, may shape vocal efficiency.

Results: Compared to human-scored epochs, human-scored mini-epochs captured significantly more transitions (1.70/minute vs. 0.21/minute, p<0.001), and significantly more wake (8.4% versus 5.4%), N1 (7.2% versus 5.4%), and N2 (51.8% versus 40.9%), less N3 (15.4% versus 25.2%) and REM sleep (16.7% versus 23.0%) (all p<0.001). Optimizing U-Sleep improved its performance significantly from F1=0.74 to F1=0.81 (p<0.05) and gave increased transition rates in the test set (original U-Sleep: 1.06/minute, optimized U-Sleep: 1.34/minute, human-scored mini-epochs: 1.70/minute). Stage distributions did not differ between optimized U-Sleep's scorings and human-scored mini-epochs. Conclusions: After optimization, U-Sleep performance in mini-epochs matched the high performance levels previously reported in both human and automated 30-second epoch scoring. This demonstrates the feasibility of precise, automated high resolution sleep staging. Future work should include external validation and application to full-night recordings.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

L.; Dalmaijer, E. S.", "abstract": "Orthorexia involves an obsessive tendency towards \"healthy\" foods. It is a risk factor for eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and the proposed \"orthorexia nervosa\") and psychological distress, but its biological mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesised that this mechanism operates through the stomach: increased gastric power differentiates appetising from unappetising foods, vagal stimulation reduces food liking, and gastric proto-nausea can be evoked by disgust; all contributors to disordered eating. We used electrogastrography alongside high-density facial landmark tracking to gauge responses to minimally processed (\"healthy\"), highly processed (\"unhealthy\"), and culturally unaccepted (\"disgusting\") foods in a non-clinical sample (N=77). Trait orthorexia was associated with increased self-reported desire to eat healthy foods. Moreover, we found that higher orthorexia was associated with increasing disgust-related facial responses to unhealthy and disgusting foods. We then identified a relationship between food-healthiness ratings and gastric power: those who generally assigned lower healthiness ratings to foods showed higher gastric power for unhealthy than healthy foods, whereas those who expressed higher healthiness ratings showed higher gastric power for healthy over unhealthy foods. This suggests that the stomach tracks individual differences in eating preferences. Crucially, and contrary to our expectations, higher trait orthorexia was associated with a paradoxical increase in gastric power to unhealthy foods. One explanation is that higher gastric power for unhealthy foods reflects increased appetite for self-denied foods. Alternatively, orthorexia itself could be an adaptive response to exert stronger cognitive control over a pre-existing gastric appetite for unhealthy foods.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Using QTL mapping we identified Monoecy1, a locus on the X chromosome controlling monoecy vs dioecy. Strikingly, transcriptomic and genomic analyses revealed that Monoecy1 contains three genes within just 60,000 bp which have distinct male-, female- and monoecy-specific expression patterns and encode for putative developmental regulators. We propose that the combinatorial interaction of those genes can explain not only the molecular control of monoecy vs. dioecy but also of male vs. female individuals.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Neutrophils are short-lived immune cells critical for host defence, yet E. faecalis-neutrophil interactions are poorly understood. Here, we show that instead of eliminating E. faecalis, neutrophils provide a niche for intracellular persistence and replication, potentially prolonging infection and inflammation at the wound site. In murine wound beds and ex vivo wound cells, intracellular E. faecalis was detected in recruited neutrophils at 24 h post-infection (h p.i). Unexpectedly, extended infection did not induce neutrophil death. Rather, E. faecalis infection significantly prolonged the lifespans of both murine and human neutrophils in vitro compared to uninfected controls. Quantification of intracellular CFU revealed that E. faecalis were phagocytosed regardless of opsonisation and persisted intracellularly through to 24 h p.i. This finding was confirmed via transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Blinded quantification and fluorescent D-amino acid staining, which marks newly synthesised bacterial peptidoglycan, revealed active replication within murine neutrophils between 6-18 h p.i., followed by a predominately persistent phase between 18-24 h p.i. Infected murine neutrophils remained immunologically active, secreting pro-inflammatory and chemoattractant cytokines. These findings highlight an underappreciated intracellular lifestyle for E. faecalis that may underly its ability to persist in chronic wounds and contribute to biofilm-associated infections.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

While HIV-1 primarily enters host cells via CD4 and the chemokine co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, HIV-2 engages a broader range of chemokine receptors. The transferrin receptor (TFRC/CD71), a membrane protein essential for iron uptake and immune function, has recently been implicated in viral entry by other pathogens. In this study, we investigated the regulation of TFRC expression in cells transduced with HIV-1 and HIV-2 pseudovirions. We observed a significant upregulation of TFRC mRNA and protein levels in HEK-293T cells 27 hours post-transduction with HIV-2, but not with HIV-1. In Jurkat T-cells, TFRC transcript levels were significantly elevated at 36 and 40 hours following HIV-2 transduction. Mechanistic analyses revealed that this upregulation depends largely on a functional HIV-2 Tat protein. Additionally, HIV-2 transduction resulted in increased intracellular iron levels in Jurkat cells at 48 hours post-infection.

While many aspects of Patescibacteria remain enigmatic, an intriguing feature is the widespread occurrence of introns within their compact genomes. To better understand the diversity, roles, and evolution of bacterial introns, we focused on tRNA introns and analyzed Patescibacteria complete genome. Notably, 20% of these genomes lacked at least one tRNA gene for a canonical amino acid, primarily tRNAAsn and tRNAAsp, whereas other tRNA genes were readily detected. This observation led us to conduct further analyses, resulting in the discovery of a novel group I intron insertion site at position 35/36 within the anticodon loop that likely prevented detection by conventional annotation tools. Splicing assays demonstrated that these bacterial introns are catalytically active and capable of self-splicing. To assess the broader distribution of this insertion site across bacteria, we analyzed 4,934 bacterial genomes and identified 269 group I introns within tRNA genes across 14 phyla. Nearly 70% of introns at position 35/36 originate from Patescibacteria, indicating that this feature is largely confined to the phylum. Subgroup classification showed that 79% of all tRNA introns belonged to the IC subgroup, whereas almost all Patescibacteria introns were assigned to IA, suggesting a distinct evolutionary origin. As most tRNA introns lacked homing endonuclease genes, horizontal transfer appears limited. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of bacterial group I introns in tRNAs, with particular emphasis on Patescibacteria. IMPORTANCE Group I introns in bacterial tRNA genes were previously known only in a limited number of phyla. Our study expands this knowledge by identifying a novel insertion position in tRNA genes of phylum Patescibacteria and mapping their phylogenetic distribution across bacterial lineages. Our result revealed that group I introns inserted in tRNA genes differed in subgroups between Patescibacteria and other bacteria, highlighting the evolutionary uniqueness of introns of Patescibacteria. Additionally, we found that group I introns are maintained in 43% of bacterial phyla, with tRNA insertions being the most common. Our findings highlight that even in complete genomes, the presence of group I introns can hinder the detection of all 20 canonical tRNA genes by conventional tRNA annotation tools.

As medical implants move towards smart technology and IoT, it is more important than ever to understand the electrical properties of biofilm formation. Here we present an attempt at understanding how C. albicans biofilm formation effects sensor technology. We propose that as the biofilm matures, it becomes increasingly hydrophobic and undergoes a reduction in effective dielectric constant and ionic conductivity. This results in an impedance mismatch that disrupts capacitive coupling between the sensor and surrounding media, this effect that can be reliably detected. We show that a C. albicans biofilm changes its dielectric properties during maturation and, once mature, can be equated to a thin dielectric insulator. We demonstrate that these properties can be used to enable constant monitoring of a C. albicans biofilm using passive RFID, offering a new detection methodology that may be applied to surfaces known to be readily colonise.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that mRNAs with HC 3'UTRs mostly encode proteins with long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), including MYC, UTX, and JMJD3. These proteins are only fully active when translated from mRNA templates that include their 3'UTRs, raising the possibility of functional interactions between 3'UTRs and IDRs. Rather than affecting protein abundance or localization, we find that HC 3'UTRs control transcriptional or histone demethylase activity through co-translationally determined protein oligomerization states that are kinetically stable. 3'UTR-dependent changes in protein folding require mRNA-IDR interactions, suggesting that mRNAs act as IDR chaperones. These mRNAs are multivalent, a biophysical RNA feature that enables their translation in network-like condensates, which provide favorable folding environments for proteins with long IDRs. These data indicate that the coding sequence is insufficient for the biogenesis of biologically active conformations of IDR-containing proteins and that RNA can catalyze protein folding.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

While SBP2 is essential for Sec incorporation in vitro and in vivo, the function of its paralog, SECISBP2L, remains incompletely defined. In this study, we investigated the distinct roles of SBP2 and SECISBP2L in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, which expresses a broad selenoproteome. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated SBP2 and SECISBP2L edited cell lines. Consistent with previous findings, SBP2 targeting impaired selenoprotein mRNA and protein expression, whereas SECISBP2L targeting did not. However, transcriptomic profiling by RNA-seq revealed that SECISBP2L targeting induced differential expression of over 800 genes, with significant enrichment in pathways related to extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion. In contrast, SBP2 targeting produced a distinct transcriptomic signature enriched for metabolic and ion transport processes. Notably, only limited overlap in differentially expressed genes was observed between the two knockout models. Mass spectrometry and immunoblot data indicated that CRISPR-targeted SECISBP2L cells produce a truncated protein via internal translation initiation, suggesting that observed gene expression changes may be attributable to loss of a portion of the SECISBP2L N-terminus. These findings support a model in which SECISBP2L plays a noncanonical role in regulating gene expression independent of selenoprotein synthesis. Given prior associations between SECISBP2L downregulation or mutation and cancer progression, our data raise the possibility that SECISBP2L modulates cell adhesion and extracellular matrix gene networks relevant to metastatic potential.

While high-fecundity plants are ideal for seed sourcing, locating these plants across heterogeneous landscapes presents a logistical challenge. This challenge is especially significant for big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), a foundational species that is the focus of large-scale seed collection for restoration efforts in western rangelands. We evaluated whether cost-effective RGB imagery from unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) could map flower stalk production in big sagebrush plants. Models were trained using three years of data from four sites spanning an elevational gradient that included all three big sagebrush subspecies: A. t. wyomingensis, A. t. vaseyana, and A. t. tridentata. Our model predicted flower stalk production from UAV imagery with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~100 stalks, which is relatively low given that some plants produced more than 700 stalks. A hurdle model that explicitly accounted for excess zeroes outperformed simpler negative binomial models, suggesting that reproductive failure is distinct from flower stalk production in reproductive plants. Structural metrics, including height differences between June and September, canopy height, and edge-to-area ratio of plant crowns, had stronger effects in our model for counts of flower stalk production than spectral data. Model performance was consistent across environmentally heterogeneous sites but declined when applied to years excluded from training, indicating that year-specific training data may be necessary for interannual predictions. These results demonstrate that UAVs can monitor reproductive potential in wild plants and help identify high-fecundity individuals for seed collection. Our work underscores the need for future research that can improve predictions of flower production, including integrating multispectral data and increasing model reliability across years to support climate-resilient restoration strategies.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Throughout Earth's history, shifts in ocean redox influenced the bioavailability of trace metals, shaping the activity of microorganisms. In Proterozoic oceans, the precipitation of copper (Cu) with sulfide was hypothesized to limit the bioavailability of Cu. This limitation may have suppressed microbial reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O), due to the Cu dependency of nitrous oxide reductase (Nos). It is thought that without this critical microbial sink, Proterozoic oceans were a significant net source of N2O. Here, we revisit this paradigm in light of recently derived ~20-fold lower estimates for sulfide in Proterozoic seawater and an empirical evaluation of the potential for microbial N2O reduction under sulfidic conditions. Leveraging publicly available environmental metatranscriptomes, we infer active N2O reduction from the detection of nosZ transcripts in multiple marine and lacustrine systems in which sulfide and Cu concentrations are analogous to those of the Proterozoic. In controlled culture experiments, we demonstrate that the purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris can reduce N2O at sulfide concentrations up to 100 M, well above levels predicted for Proterozoic oceans. Based on trace metal speciation modeling, we suggest that Cu remains bioavailable under Proterozoic-like conditions as a dissolved CuHS0 complex. Using phylogenetics, we infer that early N2O reducers were probably anoxygenic phototrophs and performed N2O reduction as dark metabolism. Collectively, these observations suggest microbial N2O reduction occurs under euxinic conditions, implying that Proterozoic marine N2O emissions were substantially lower than previously proposed.

This study revisits the Circle-seq approach for enrichment of eccDNA to address if these limitations, hypothesizing that experimental procedures significantly contribute to the observed low eccDNA overlap. We optimized the protocol by reducing the time. Linear DNA is digested by increasing exonuclease V activity. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 for mitochondrial linearization, which proved superior to restriction enzymes. A key finding is the critical role of random hexamer primer concentration and genomic DNA input in Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) for generating high-quality long amplicons from eccDNA (concatemeric tandem copy, CTC), essential for confident de novo eccDNA construction from long-read sequencing data. Lower primer concentrations substantially increased the percentage of CTC-derived eccDNA and improved the overlap of identified eccDNAs in technical replicates. Applying this revisited approach to human myeloma and breast cancer cell lines, as well as xenograft models, demonstrated that the optimized conditions enhanced the overlap of detected eccDNA up to over 50% overlap which substantially improved over previous studies (less than 1%).

Implanted neuroprostheses can restore standing and walking after spinal cord injury and somatosensation after limb loss. Yet, current approaches often fail to sufficiently and reliably activate hamstring muscles crucial for robust upright mobility, or to target the afferent fibers in mixed nerves like the sciatic nerve for sensory neuroprostheses. We developed a novel methodology using high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging to visualize and track fascicle groups innervating distinct hamstring muscle targets along the human sciatic nerve. This approach offers an efficient tool for mapping fascicular topography in complex neural pathways, providing an anatomically informed framework for optimizing standing neuroprostheses. Methods. Bilateral sciatic nerves were dissected and excised from an embalmed human cadaver, annotated with branch names, and stained with phosphotungstic acid before undergoing microCT scanning at 11.4 m isotropic resolution. Resulting images were segmented with a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network. Segmentation results were used to quantify morphological metrics and track the fascicular organization along ~25 to 30 cm of the nerve. Results. Gross dissection revealed a proximal-to-distal branching sequence in the right and left sciatic nerves: long head of the biceps femoris (lhBF), hamstring part of the adductor magnus and semimembranosus (HAM/SM), and the semitendinosus (ST) muscles, with branches originating medially from the sciatic nerve and following an inferomedial trajectory. Branch-free lengths exhibited asymmetry, especially between the lumbosacral roots to the first branch (5.5 cm left vs. 1.5 cm right) and lhBF to the HAM/SM branch (9.0 cm left vs. 16.5 cm right). MicroCT analysis quantified bilateral symmetry in fascicle diameters (~0.4 mm) and total fascicle counts (~84). In contrast, hamstring-innervating fascicle counts were asymmetric, averaging fewer on the left (~7) than the right (~9). The 3D fascicular maps revealed that hamstring fascicles primarily aggregated within the anteromedial aspect of the sciatic nerve and remained separate for considerable distances (up to ~13 cm for ST) proximal to their branching points. Significance. Our microCT-based approach enables efficient, high-resolution 3D mapping of fascicular organization within large, complex peripheral nerves like the sciatic nerve, overcoming previous technical limitations. By quantifying fascicular morphology and organization, this methodology directly informs the development of neuroprostheses with enhanced activation of the hamstring muscle group, improving standing functions.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations.

First, a classifier was trained using static embeddings extracted from each pLM.

However, whether these molecular subtypes originate from the corresponding cell types in the normal urothelium and whether different cells of origin influence bladder cancer progression remain unclear. Here, we conducted cell-type-specific lineage tracing in CRISPR/Cas9-induced mouse bladder cancer models of Pten and Trp53 targeting. We show that although basal, intermediate, and superficial umbrella cells can all serve as the cell of origin for bladder cancer, transformed umbrella cells were gradually displaced by tumor cells from inner layers, particularly transformed basal cells, which had highest stemness. Histological and single cell RNA-sequencing data comparing basal- and intermediate-cell-induced bladder tumors revealed that basal-induced tumors displayed higher heterogeneity, and contained unique cell clusters including Krt14+Ki67+ highly proliferative basal cells, squamous cell carcinoma, and transitioning cells towards the Gata3+ luminal subtype. Trajectory analysis confirmed the cell lineage differentiation hierarchy uncovered in lineage tracing. Moreover, human bladder cancer molecular subtype signatures were highly enriched in mouse tumor cell clusters of the corresponding cell of origin, and a gene signature derived from the unique basal-induced clusters is predictive of worse patient outcome. Overall, our results support that the basal and luminal molecular subtypes of bladder cancer have the corresponding cells of origin as their basis, and that urothelial basal cells are intrinsically more competitive than intermediate and umbrella cells in generating aggressive bladder cancer subtypes.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Although phased out in the early 2000s, their chemical persistence, recycling into new materials, and leaching from waste sites have led to ongoing environmental contamination and widespread human exposure, especially through diet and indoor dust. This is particularly concerning for developing individuals, who not only accumulate the highest levels via placental transfer, breastfeeding, and behavioral factors, but are also especially vulnerable to long-term effects. Despite well-documented impacts of developmental PBDE exposure on neurobehavioral, endocrine, and metabolic systems, the effects on the immune system remain comparatively underexplored. To begin addressing this gap, we focused on mast cells, innate immune cells well-positioned to contribute to the multisystemic effects of developmental exposures. Mast cells are long-lived, tissue-resident cells enriched at barrier surfaces and perivascular sites throughout the body, including the brain. Their widespread distribution, extensive receptor repertoire, and unique ability to store and rapidly release bioactive mediators from cytoplasmic granules position them as key modulators of immune, endocrine, and nervous system function. Using oral exposure to two doses of a PBDE mixture throughout pregnancy and lactation in mice, we show that maternal exposure to ~87 ug/kg/day, aligned with the lower end of doses known to affect metabolic and neurobehavioral outcomes in preclinical models and within 10-fold of levels measured in human serum and placenta, leads to persistent dysfunction in mast cell mediator release in adult male and female offspring. This was evidenced by blunted anaphylaxis-associated hypothermia and plasma histamine release in vivo. These deficits were not due to changes in tissue-resident mast cell numbers, but rather to an impaired capacity to sustain histamine release over time. Studies in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) revealed that histamine synthesis was intact, but granule maturation and stimulus-induced calcium mobilization were disrupted, in association with downregulation of genes such as IGF2R, ITGA4, ITGB6, and NGFR. Given that the bone marrow is the primary postnatal source of mast cells, these findings suggest that PBDEs induce lasting reprogramming at the level of hematopoietic progenitors. This may have broad implications not only for mast cell function across tissues, but also for other immune cell lineages that arise from the same progenitor pool. In sum, this study provides the first evidence that developmental exposure to PBDEs induces long-lasting impairments in mast cell functions, suggesting a previously unrecognized mechanism by which early-life exposure to environmental toxicants could contribute to persistent physiological and behavioral dysfunctions.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

M.; Addagarla, M.; Judd, H. N.; Wang, X.; Maupin-Furlow, J. A.", "abstract": "Haloferax volcanii is a halophilic archaeon that preferentially utilizes glycerol as a carbon source, placing glycerol kinase (GK, glpK) at the center of its metabolism. In contrast to bacterial GKs, which are often regulated by allosteric inhibition, H. volcanii GK lacks this mode of control, indicating alternative regulatory mechanisms. Here, we show that lysine acetylation of H. volcanii GK enhances its activity and abundance during growth on glycerol, with K153 identified as the primary site of modification. Structural modeling and comparative genomics revealed that K153 resides in a conserved flexible loop common to haloarchaeal GKs. Carbon shifts from glucose to glycerol led to increased activity and enrichment of the K153-acetylated form, as determined by AQUA-MS. GK and the acetylation mimic K153Q supported growth on glycerol, while the non-acetylatable K153R variant did not. Thermal shift analysis showed that the K153R substitution reduced GK stability, while K153Q had no effect. Size exclusion chromatography indicated that GK is predominantly dimeric but forms a tetramer when purified from glycerol-grown cells and assayed with glycerol - coinciding with the highest K153 acetylation levels. Kinetic analysis revealed that K153 acetylation is required to maintain cooperative substrate binding, with the non-acetylatable K153R variant exhibiting a loss of allosteric behavior. The GNAT-family acetyltransferase Pat2 was found to acetylate GK at K153, and{Delta} pat2 mutants exhibited reduced GK protein abundance, linking Pat2 to regulation of GK. These results identify a dynamic, carbon source-responsive lysine acetylation mechanism that modulates GK, highlighting lysine acetylation as a key component of haloarchaeal metabolic regulation.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we report an improved O. corvina genome assembly generated using a high-quality hybrid approach that combines Illumina short-read and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing. The new assembly consists of only 13 contigs totaling 21.8 Mb, with an N50 of 4.4 Mb, and has a completeness of 98.97%. A total of 7,232 protein-coding genes were identified using an integrative approach that combines de novo predictions, homology-based inferences, and RNA-sequencing-guided evidence. Notably, 158 putative protease-coding genes were identified representing a substantial increase from the 73 predicted proteases in the previous annotation.

A.; Michor, F.", "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing captures static snapshots of gene expression but lacks the ability to track continuous gene expression dynamics over time. To overcome this limitation, we developed PROFET (Particle-based Reconstruction Of generative Force-matched Expression Trajectories), a computational framework that reconstructs continuous, nonlinear single-cell gene expression trajectories from sparsely sampled scRNA-seq data. PROFET first generates particle flows between time-stamped samples using a novel Lipschitz-regularized gradient flow approach and then learns a global vector field for trajectory reconstruction using neural force-matching. The framework was developed using synthetic data simulating cell state transitions and subsequently validated on both mouse and human in vitro datasets. We then deployed PROFET to investigate heterogeneity in treatment responses to palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, in hormone receptor positive breast cancer. By comparing newly generated scRNA-seq data from a palbociclib-resistant breast cancer cell line with published patient-derived datasets, we identified a subpopulation of patient cells exhibiting profound phenotypic shifts in response to treatment, along with surface markers uniquely enriched in those cells. By recovering temporal information from static snapshots, PROFET enables inference of continuous single-cell expression trajectories, providing a powerful tool for dissecting the heterogeneity of cell state transitions in treatment responses.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

However, automatically building high-accuracy protein structures from cryo-EM density maps remains a crucial challenge. In this work, we introduce MICA, a fully automatic and multimodal deep learning approach combining cryo-EM density maps with AlphaFold3-predicted structures at both input and output levels to improve cryo-EM protein structure modeling. It first uses a multi-task encoder-decoder architecture with a feature pyramid network to predict backbone atoms, C atoms and amino acid types from both cryo-EM maps and AlphaFold3-predicted structures, which are used to build an initial backbone model. This model is further refined using AlphaFold3-predicted structures and density maps to build final atomic structures. MICA significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of both modeling accuracy and completeness and is robust to protein size and map resolution. Additionally, it builds high-accuracy structural models with an average template-based modeling score (TM-score) of 0.93 from recently released high-resolution cryo-EM density maps, showing it can be used for real-world, automated, accurate protein structure determination.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

Genetic variants are key drivers of RNA mis-splicing, yet how they induce tissue-specific splicing remains largely unclear. Here, we introduce Spliformer-v2, a deep learning model based on SegmentNT architecture to predict multi-tissue RNA splicing. Spliformer-v2 is trained on paired genome/transcriptome data from 18 human tissues, including 12 central nervous system and 6 peripheral tissues. Spliformer-v2 accurately predicts the effects of heterozygous and homozygous variants on splicing, outperforming existing models (such as SpliceTransformer) across tissues for both regression evaluations (R2: 0.83-0.89 vs 0.10-0.41) and classification evaluations (AUPRC: 0.90-0.95 vs 0.45-0.61). Analysis of ClinVar dataset indicated the link of tissues-specific splicing variants with disease pathogenicity. Analysis of genome-wide association study hits from neurological diseases (such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) identified tissue-specific splicing variants in genes like CREB3, SCFD1, MAPT and TOMM40, suggesting potential splicing mechanisms in disease. In summary, Spliformer-v2 is a powerful tool for predicting RNA splicing across the most comprehensive set of human brain and spinal cord tissues to date. This advancement enhances our understanding of tissue-specific splicing variants and their roles in neurological and other complex diseases, thereby advancing the discovery of novel drug targets and biomarkers in precision medicine.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Background Orphan genes lack recognizable homologues outside a given taxonomic unit; thus, they have elusive evolutionary origins. They have long been invoked to explain lineage specific traits in medicine and evolutionary biology. Here, we re-analyzed a 2023 repository of putative orphan genes compiled from over 80,000 bacterial species. Using iterative homology-based analyses, we reassessed each gene's taxonomic distribution across a broader genomic landscape. Results These results challenge the long-held assertion that species truly harbor large numbers of orphan genes and instead demonstrate that their prevalence has been overestimated. Many orphan genes from 2023 now match homologues in other bacterial taxa (2025), demonstrating that sparse sampling had inflated earlier orphan counts. To better reflect these findings, we propose the term Cryptogenic Gene Candidates (CGCs). This offers a more precise alternative to orphan genes, as it more accurately reflects the provisional and potentially temporary nature of these genes' apparent uniqueness. This revised terminology acknowledges that many genes identified as having a unique origin may lose this status as more genomes are sequenced. Although our analyses substantially reduced the number of false-positive CGCs, it cannot determine whether a given CGC truly encodes a functional protein or is an artifact of bioinformatic analysis. To minimize annotation artifacts, we then applied additional computational filters to prioritize candidates most likely to encode bona fide proteins. Conclusions This work revises the understanding of orphan gene prevalence, establishes CGCs as a more accurate classification, and provides a prioritized set of candidates to guide future experimental studies.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}

C.; Shi, C.; Stratton, K. G.; Stohel, I.; Freire-Zapata, V.; Tfaily, M. M.; Eloe-Fadrosh, E. L.; Graham, E. B.", "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition by microorganisms represents the largest uncertainty in predicting terrestrial carbon-atmosphere feedbacks. Yet, we lack systematic understanding of the microbial taxa that drive decomposition of chemically distinct carbon pools and of the metabolic pathways they employ across environmental gradients. Here, we address this critical gap using the first continental-scale soil dataset pairing shotgun metagenomes with high-resolution molecular characterization of SOM chemistry. We use data from 109 standardized soil cores across the United States to assemble 0.76 terabases (Tbs) of prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes (344 MAGs) and identify 66,727 distinct SOM molecules, integrating these datasets to reveal widespread microbial potential for depolymerizing recalcitrant carbon compounds previously considered stable. Notably, we uncover complementary metabolic specialization between two abundant bacterial orders, Rhizobiales and Chthoniobacterales. This metabolic partitioning is consistent across soil depths and activity levels, suggesting coordinated decomposition of chemically complex carbon through distinct but complementary biochemical strategies. The metabolic potential for depolymerization of recalcitrant compounds is supported by the abundance of these molecules across the soils, as indicated by Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS), and by flux balance analysis of metabolic models. Our continental-scale integration of microbial genotypes with their chemical substrates reveals that a substantial fraction of SOM previously considered recalcitrant harbors decomposition potential that current Earth system models fail to capture. These findings provide mechanistic insight for incorporating microbial metabolic pathways into carbon cycle predictions and highlight an underappreciated vulnerability of soil carbon to environmental variability.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": ""}
