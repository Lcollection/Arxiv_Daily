S.; Sense, F.; van Rijn, H.; Stocco, A.", "abstract": "Despite the importance of memories in everyday life and the progress made in understanding how they are encoded and retrieved, the neural processes by which declarative memories are maintained or forgotten remain elusive. Part of the problem is that it is empirically difficult to measure the rate at which memories fade, even between repeated presentations of the source of the memory. Without such a ground-truth measure, it is hard to identify the corresponding neural correlates. This study addresses this problem by comparing individual patterns of functional connectivity against behavioral differences in forgetting speed derived from computational phenotyping. Specifically, the individual-specific values of the speed of forgetting in long-term memory (LTM) were estimated for 33 participants using a formal model fit to accuracy and response time data from an adaptive paired-associate learning task. Individual speeds of forgetting were then used to examine participant-specific patterns of resting-state fMRI connectivity, using machine learning techniques to identify the most predictive and generalizable features. Our results show that individual speeds of forgetting are associated with resting-state connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) as well as between the DMN and cortical sensory areas. Cross-validation showed that individual speeds of forgetting were predicted with high accuracy (r = .78) from these connectivity patterns alone. These results support the view that DMN activity and the associated sensory regions are actively involved in maintaining memories and preventing their decline, a view that can be seen as evidence for the hypothesis that forgetting is a result of storage degradation, rather than of retrieval failure.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Typically, manipulations that elicit neural response suppression quench variability, an observation that has led some to suggest that these two phenomena may share a common origin. However, few studies have systematically examined the relationship between surround suppression and variability. Surround suppression is mediated by multiple circuits and mechanisms that depend on the size of the sensory stimulus, and cortical layer. Variability is also laminar dependent. To understand how surround suppression and variability may influence laminar processing, here we have used electrophysiological laminar recordings to examine how neural response variability and the shared variability among neurons are modulated by visual stimulus size across the layers of macaque primary visual cortex (V1). We find that surround suppression does not always quench variability. Instead, variability is tuned for stimulus size in a layer-dependent manner. In all layers, stimulation of the receptive field (RF) reduced neural response variability, and the shared variability among neurons, relative to their pre-stimulus values. As the stimulus was enlarged beyond the RF, to involve the near RF-surround, both neural response variability and shared variability further decreased in infragranular layers, but did not change in granular and supragranular layers. In contrast, larger stimuli involving the far RF-surround increased both neural response variability and shared variability, relative to their value for a stimulus matched to the RF size, in supragranular layers, but decreased them or did not change them in granular and infragranular layers. Surprisingly, we also found that visual stimuli smaller than the RF could increase variability relative to baseline values, particularly in granular and infragranular layers. Our results point to multiple laminar-specific circuits and mechanisms as the source of variability, and call for new models of neural response variability.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Using this approach, we have combined data from cell lines treated with either the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor, Roxadustat (FG-4592), or with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, or with a DMSO control, to identify a total of 4,993 and 3,247 proline hydroxylation sites, respectively, in HEK293 and RCC4 cells. A subset of 1,954 (HEK293) and 1,253 (RCC4) non-collagen proline hydroxylation sites with high confidence were inhibited by FG-4592 treatment. Features characteristic of proline hydroxylated peptides were identified, which were consistent between the HEK293 and RCC4 datasets. The more hydrophilic HILIC fractions were enriched in peptides containing hydroxylated proline residues, which showed characteristic differences in charge and mass distribution, as compared with either unmodified, or oxidised peptides. Furthermore, we discovered that the intensity of the diagnostic hydroxyproline immonium ion was dependent upon parameters including the MS collision energy setting, parent peptide concentration and the sequence of amino acids adjacent to the modified proline. We show using synthetic peptides that a combination of retention time in LC and optimised MS parameter settings allows reliable identification of proline hydroxylation sites in peptides, even when multiple prolines residues are present. Focussing on proteins in which newly identified proline hydroxylation sites were inhibited by the pan-PHD inhibitor, FG-4592, showed enrichment for proteins involved in metabolism of RNA, mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation, including the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit, Repo-Man (CDCA2). We show that Repo-Man is hydroxylated at P604 and in the accompanying study, [Druker et al., 2025], we present a combination of cellular and biochemical evidence that hydroxylation of Repo-Man at P604 is important for its function in controlling mitotic progression.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Originally proposed as a technique for establishing functional relationships between various genes through their correlated presence/absence patterns, phylogenetic profiling is currently considered a powerful exploration tool for investigating the evolutionary distribution of nearly any trait across both gene or species phylogenies. However, computing and visualizing phylogenetic profiles based on large trees is a laborious task. First, traits need to be mapped against tree nodes, which usually requires the implementation of ad hoc scripts or substantial manual work. Second, tree mapping is often limited to leaf nodes, neglecting the usefulness of profiling traits against internal tree nodes. Lastly, graphical exploration of large phylogenetic tree-based profiles is challenging, as plotting usually requires complex manual adjustments and most visualization tools cannot scale to the size and complexity of current datasets. To address these limitations, we have developed TreeProfiler, a command line tool designed to facilitate both the automated annotation of large trees using a wide range of data sources, and the visual exploration of these annotations as phylogenetic profiles. TreeProfiler enables seamless annotation of massive trees and data tables, including built-in support for functional data, taxonomic information, multiple sequence alignments and protein domain architectures. Importantly, TreeProfiler expands its annotation capabilities beyond tree leaves, enabling the annotation of internal nodes with summarized or consensus information under each branch. Additionally, TreeProfiler offers a predefined set of graphical layouts that are based on the ETE Toolkit v4.0 library. TreeProfiler offers unique capabilities that extend and facilitate the use of phylogenetic profiling techniques for a broad landscape of scenarios and for a wide community of researchers interested in evolutionary analysis. To demonstrate its value, we showcase TreeProfiler by automatically profiling multiple data sources across a large bacterial phylogeny including 45,555 species, and by exploring functional and taxonomic annotations over a large gene family tree.

Poricidal flowers are also often closely associated with buzz pollination by bees. Yet we lack an updated angiosperm-wide survey of their phylogenetic distribution. We identify all known angiosperm genera containing poricidal flowers via a literature survey. We determined their phylogenetic distribution and minimum number of independent gains and losses via a species-level angiosperm-wide phylogeny. We estimated if evolution of poricidal flowers is associated with changes in speciation/extinction via diversification rate analyses. Poricidal flowers occur across 87 angiosperm families and 639 genera containing >28,000 species. At the species level, an average of 205 independent gains and 215 losses of poricidal flowers occurred. Angiosperm-wide analyses suggest an early burst in poricidal evolution, but no differences in net diversification (origination-extinction) between non-poricidal and poricidal taxa. Analyses for two focal families however indicate strong context-dependent effects of poricidal flowers on diversification. Poricidal evolution thus represents a large-scale example of convergent evolution in floral form, but effects on diversification appear to be strongly contingent on phylogenetic and ecological background.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Here we demonstrate a neural correlate and causal role of dorsal prefrontal cortex, specifically anterior supplementary motor cortex (MOs) in perseveration in mice performing a dynamic reward learning task. An auditory go cue signaled mice to turn a wheel either left or right, with the reward probability of each action switching in blocks. Mice perseverated, gaining suboptimal reward, but were faster when making repeated choices. Neuropixels recordings found neurons whose activity correlated with perseveration and predicted rapid reaction times, almost exclusively in anterior MOs. Optogenetically inhibiting this region at choice time reduced perseveration and slowed reactions. In contrast, inactivating medial prefrontal cortex at choice time had no effect, but inactivating it after reward delivery impaired learning. In this task, therefore, anterior MOs reflects a perseverative decision variable, and is necessary for mediating the effect of this decision variable on choice and reaction time.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

The presence of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins was observed commonly in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Exogenous introduction of mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5) protein with artificial CAT-tail mimicking sequences enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) and inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation.

Older musicians exhibited less upregulation of task-induced functional connectivity than older non-musicians in auditory dorsal regions, which predicted better behavioral performance in older musicians.

Therefore, these methods have high false-negative error rates due to a lack of reference sequences with a representative coverage of AMR protein diversity. Deep learning (DL) has been used as an alternative to sequence alignment, as artificial neural networks (ANNs) can extract abstract features from data and therefore limit the need for sequence comparisons.

We recently introduced the Myomatrix array, an FMEA optimized for measuring the activity of individual motor units (the collection of muscle fibers innervated by a single motor neuron) in freely behaving animals. Although FMEAs are fundamentally changing the way electromyography (EMG) is acquired, the number of recording channels is limited by the size of the plug that interfaces with the signal processing hardware and the density of electrode connections on the array. Increasing EMG channel count and supporting electrophysiological studies in smaller animals depends on two seemingly incompatible goals: reducing device size while increasing the number of recording channels. The solution to these goals is to increase the channel count per wire output. Current off-the-shelf designs require a separate headstage and FMEA to be used simultaneously. In our prior devices, each FMEA had a dedicated wire output for every electrode input, creating a channel density of 1:1. To improve this channel density, we have developed an FMEA with an integrated digital amplifier (Bare-Die RHD2216, INTAN INC, USA). The design of the FMEA reduces the footprint of the device back end by 74% and relocates the Intan bare die from the headstage to the FMEA itself, creating a channel density of 1:3.2. Our methodology combines standard FMEA microfabrication with wire-bonding and surface-mounted components, enabling direct integration into a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) connection into the device itself, without any separate headstage. With this initial device there is a 1:3.2 channel density; however, our method allows using other bare die amplifiers (Intan, Inc., USA) for a channel density of 1:12.8.

In this study, we performed a loss-of-function genetic screen targeting genes potentially involved in microtubular motility. A genetic background that blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusions was used to accurately analyze autophagosome positioning. We discovered that pre-fusion autophagosomes move towards the non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center (ncMTOC) in Drosophila fat cells, which requires a dynein-dynactin complex. This process is regulated by the small GTPases Rab7 and Rab39 together with their adaptors: Epg5 and ema, respectively. The dynein-dependent movement of vesicles toward the nucleus/ncMTOC is essential for efficient autophagosomal fusions with lysosomes and subsequent degradation. Remarkably, altering the balance of kinesin and dynein motors changes the direction of autophagosome movement, indicating a competitive relationship where normally dynein-mediated transport prevails. Since pre-fusion lysosomes were positioned similarly to autophagosomes, it indicates that pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes converge at the ncMTOC, which increases the efficiency of vesicle fusions.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Although neural activity in the AFP has been extensively investigated during awake singing, very little is known about its neural activity patterns during other behavioral states. Here, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate spontaneous neural activity in the AFP during natural sleep and awake periods in male zebra finches. We found that during sleep, neuron populations in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) spontaneously exhibited synchronized bursts that were characterized by a negative sharp deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. LMAN population bursts occurred primarily during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity observed in rodent hippocampus. We also examined the functional connectivity within the AFP by calculating the pairwise LFP coherence. As expected, delta and theta band coherence within LMAN and Area X was higher during sleep compared to awake periods. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong coherence between LMAN and Area X during sleep, suggesting that the input from LMAN into Area X is spatially restricted. Overall, these results provide the first description of spontaneous neural dynamics within the AFP across behavioral states.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

A.; Chen, T.; Aoi, M.; Chalasani, S. H.", "abstract": "Decision-making is a ubiquitous component of animal behavior that is often studied in the context of foraging. Foragers make a series of decisions while locating food (food search), choosing between food types (diet or patch choice), and allocating time spent within patches of food (patch-leaving). Here, we introduce a framework for investigating foraging decisions using detailed analysis of individual behavior and quantitative modeling in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We demonstrate that C. elegans make accept-reject patch choice decisions upon encounter with food. Specifically, we show that when foraging amongst small, dispersed, and dilute patches of bacteria, C. elegans initially reject several bacterial patches, opting to prioritize exploration of the environment, before switching to a more exploitatory foraging strategy during subsequent encounters. Observed across a range of bacterial patch densities, sizes, and distributions, we use a quantitative model to show that this decision to explore or exploit is guided by available sensory information, internal satiety signals, and learned environmental statistics related to the bacterial density of recently encountered and exploited patches. We behaviorally validated model predictions on animals that had been food-deprived, animals foraging in environments with multiple patch densities, and null mutants with defective sensory modalities. Broadly, we present a framework to study ecologically relevant foraging decisions that could guide future investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying decision-making.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

By leveraging AutoEncoders, a type of artificial neural network, we developed a method to compress MD trajectories into significantly smaller latent spaces. Our method can save up to 98% in disk space compared to xtc, a highly compressed trajectory format from the widely used MD program package GROMACS, thus facilitating storage and sharing of simulation trajectories. Atom coordinates are very accurately reconstructed from compressed data. The method was tested across a diverse sets of biomolecular systems, including folded proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins, phospholipid bilayers, protein-ligand complexes, large protein complexes and membrane-bound protein systems. The reconstructed trajectories demonstrated consistent accuracy in recovering key biophysically relevant properties for proteins, lipids and composite systems. The compression efficiency was particularly beneficial for larger systems. This approach enables the scientific community to efficiently store and share large-scale biomolecular simulation data, potentially enhancing collaborative research efforts.

Establishing the timing of past evolutionary events is a fundamental task in the reconstruction of the history of life. State-of-the-art molecular dating methods generally involve the reconstruction of a species tree from conserved, vertically evolving genes, and the assumption of a molecular clock calibrated with the fossil record. Although this approach is extremely useful, its use is limited to speciation events and does not account for genes following different evolutionary paths. Recently, an alternative methodology for the relative dating of evolutionary events has been proposed that considers the distribution of branch lengths across sets of gene trees. 2. Here, we validate this methodology by comparing the relative age estimates with a fossil-calibrated phylogeny and propose a model-based formalisation using a Bayesian framework. 3. Our analyses revealed that the normalisation of the distances of interest with the branch lengths of a reference clade present across the set of gene trees results in narrower distributions, allowing the correct inference of the relative ordering of evolutionary events. 4. We show that distributions of normalised lengths can be modelled using gamma or lognormal distributions and demonstrate that inference of the posterior distribution of the mode allows accurate relative age estimation, as assessed by a strong correlation with the molecular clock-dated tree.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, including the betaherpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus (CMV). The host innate response acts as the first line of defense, and CMV, like other viruses, has consequently evolved multiple mechanisms to manipulate host interferon (IFN) responses. DEAD-box Helicase 41 (DDX41) is an intracellular dsDNA sensor that, upon activation by Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), triggers type I IFN production through the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) signaling pathway. Here, we show the activation of this signaling pathway during lytic CMV infection, wherein BTK, DDX41, and STING are activated through tyrosine phosphorylation, and both DDX41 and BTK interact with STING. Further, CMV infection re-localizes DDX41 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it localizes to the perinuclear virus assembly compartment (vAC). Here, DDX41 phosphorylation is attenuated, suggesting cytoplasmic redistribution leads to a less active or inactive form. Additionally, DDX41 co-localizes in the vAC with the CMV tegument proteins, pp65 and pp71, each of which interact with DDX41 in immunoprecipitation assays. We further demonstrate the protective role of this signaling pathway, as treatment with the BTK inhibitor, orelabrutinib, attenuates DDX41 phosphorylation/activation and supports increased expression of viral proteins and virus replication. In sum, our work highlights the important role of BTK-DDX41-STING signaling in the innate immune response against CMV, which the virus subverts by attenuating its cytoplasmic activity, thereby diverting it from its typically protective function.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Theoretical accounts postulate that the catecholaminergic neuromodulator noradrenaline shapes cognition and behavior by reducing the impact of prior expectations on learning, inference, and decision-making. A ubiquitous effect of dynamic priors on perceptual decisions under uncertainty is choice history bias: the tendency to systematically repeat, or alternate, previous choices, even when stimulus categories are presented in a random sequence. Here, we directly test for a causal impact of catecholamines on these priors. We pharmacologically elevated catecholamine levels through the application of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. We quantified the resulting changes in observers' history biases in a visual perceptual decision task. Choice history biases in this task were highly idiosyncratic, tending toward choice repetition or alternation in different individuals. Atomoxetine decreased these biases (toward either repetition or alternation) compared to placebo. Behavioral modeling indicates that this bias reduction was due to a reduced bias in the accumulation of sensory evidence, rather than of the starting point of the accumulation process. Atomoxetine had no significant effect on other behavioral measures tested, including response time and choice accuracy. Atomoxetine and variations of pupil-linked arousal at slower and faster timescales had analogous effects on choice history bias. We conclude that catecholamines reduce the impact of a specific form of prior on perceptual decisions.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

AREG has also been detected in the nucleus of some epithelial cancers although the physiological stimulus and nuclear role are not known. Using immortalized mammary epithelial cells (MECs), we have discovered that AREG undergoes retrograde trafficking to the nuclear membrane (nAREG) in close proximity with lamin A where it is required to both maintain constitutive heterochromatin and transiently increases H3K9me3 in response to replication stress (RS). RS resulted in an increase in AREG protein, enhanced nuclear membrane prelamin A and increased heterochromatin protein, HP1. In contrast, siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous AREG reduced HP1 and SUV39h1 proteins accompanied by decompaction and reduction in H3K9me3 heterochromatin despite the presence of soluble AREG. The nuclear membrane (NM) was also impacted resulting in dissipation of the Ran-GTPase gradient, reduced matrix lamin A with increased invaginations. Moreover, AREG knockdown slowed replication fork speed, increased new replication origins and enhanced global transcription while promoting and exacerbating DNA damage in response to RS. DNA damage was most pronounced in AREG-depleted BRCA2mut/+ MECs which entered senescence following RS, indicating an important nAREG-dependent role in genomic stabilization in these cells. Overall, this study reveals a novel and fundamental role for nAREG in heterochromatin maintenance and the response to RS, that is most critical in BRCA2mut/+ MECs deficient in replication fork protection.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

One prominent approach to forecasting such long-run outcomes is the successor representation (SR), which predicts future states aggregated over multiple timesteps. Although much behavioral and neural evidence suggests that people and animals use such a representation, it remains unknown how they acquire it. It has frequently been assumed to be learned by temporal difference bootstrapping (SR-TD(0)), but this assumption has largely not been empirically tested or compared to alternatives including eligibility traces (SR-TD({lambda} > 0)). Here we address this gap by leveraging trial-by-trial reaction times in graph sequence learning tasks, which are favorable for studying learning dynamics because the long horizons in these studies differentiate the transient update dynamics of different learning rules. We examined the behavior of SR-TD({lambda}) on a probabilistic graph learning task alongside a number of alternatives, and found that behavior was best explained by a hybrid model which learned via SR-TD({lambda}) alongside an additional predictive model of recency. The relatively large {lambda} we estimate indicates a predominant role of eligibility trace mechanisms over the bootstrap-based chaining typically assumed. Our results provide insight into how humans learn predictive representations, and demonstrate that people simultaneously learn the SR alongside lower-order predictions.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Epilepsy affects around 50 million people worldwide, and reliable pre-seizure biomarkers could significantly improve neuromodulation therapies for drug-resistant patients. Recent research using stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) has revealed transient changes in network dynamics preceding seizures. In particular, our previous work showed that these alterations are driven by recurrent, short-lasting (0.6 s) high-connectivity network configuration, termed High-Connectivity States (HCS). Here, we aim to replicate and further characterize HCS as a biomarker in a multicentric patient cohort, assess its robustness across recording modalities and montages, explore its relationship with interpretable physiological variables, and examine its network-level association with seizure-onset zone (SOZ) dynamics. Approach. We analyzed long-term intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from 12 patients with sEEG and electrocorticography (ECoG). In two patients with extensive clinical information, we examined the interplay between HCS and SOZ dynamics. We also developed a low-dimensional stochastic network model to investigate mechanistic rationales of HCS emergence. Additionally, we compared HCS dynamics with gamma-band activity and heart rate, and tested robustness across different montage configurations. Main Results. In most patients, HCS probability reliably increased hours before seizure onset. In the two deeply characterized patients, this increase was specifically linked to an increased network centrality within the SOZ. The network model revealed that changes in HCS probability stem primarily from topological reconfigurations rather than changes in mean connectivity, underscoring the importance of dynamic interactions between epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic regions. Significance. These results support HCS probability as a promising biomarker for early seizure prediction and offer mechanistic insights into pre-seizure brain network dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

In nonhuman primates, the sensitivity and resolution of cells in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1) also improve, but not enough to account for the perceptual changes. So, what aspects of visual system development limit visual sensitivity in infants? Improvements in behavioral sensitivity might arise from maturation of regions downstream of V1 such as V2, V4 and IT, which are thought to support increasingly complex perceptual abilities. We recorded the responses of populations of neurons in areas V1, V2, V4, and pIT to radial frequency patterns - a type of global form stimulus. Subjects were three young monkeys between the ages of 19 and 54 weeks, and a single adult animal. We found that neurons and neural populations in V4 reliably encoded global form in radial frequency stimuli at the earliest ages we studied, while V1 neurons do not. V2 and pIT populations also showed some degree of selectivity for these patterns at early ages, especially at higher radial frequency values. We did not find significant, systematic changes in neural decoding performance that could account for the improvement in behavioral performance over the same age range in an overlapping group of animals [Rodriguez Deliz et al., 2024]. Finally, consistent with our prior behavioral results, neural populations in V4 show highest sensitivity for the higher radial frequency values which contain the highest concentration of curvature and orientation cues.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

A \"reinstatement index\" was estimated from fMRI data collected during tests of source memory for scene images, and multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the effects of the variables of interest on scene reinstatement. There were robust age differences in reinstatement, cortical thickness, and cortical volume. In the PPA and MPA, cortical volume fully mediated the effects of age on reinstatement.

L.", "abstract": "Background: Global reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF) are among the earliest and most consistent abnormalities observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), preceding both cortical plaque formation and cognitive decline. While the pial arterial network - a critical supplier of intracortical perfusion - has been overlooked in this context, it may play a pivotal role in early vascular pathology. Here, we report extensive cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) within the pial artery and arteriole network in the J20 (PDGF-APPSw, Ind) mouse model of AD. Methods: Using premortem delivery of Methoxy-XO4 to label A{beta}, and arterial vascular labeling, we assessed A{beta} burden on the pial artery/arteriole network and cerebral blood flow in aged male and female WT and J20 AD mice. Results: We show that 12-month-old J20 mice exhibit significant A{beta} deposition across major leptomeningeal arteries (ACA, MCA) and pial collaterals, with ~40% vessel coverage in males and ~20% in females - substantially exceeding A{beta} levels in cortical or hippocampal vessels. This vascular A{beta} burden was accompanied by compensatory enlargement and increased tortuosity of pial collateral vessels. Yet, despite this apparent remodeling, CBF was reduced by ~15% in J20 mice, and this decline was significantly associated with leptomeningeal CAA burden. Conclusions: This is the first study to comprehensively characterize meningeal arterial A{beta} accumulation in a preclinical model of vascular AD, mirroring recent observations in early-stage human disease. Our findings implicate meningeal CAA as a potential driver of early CBF disruption and suggest that pial collateral remodeling may reflect a compensatory response to vascular insufficiency. Moreover, we identify robust sex differences in CAA burden, paralleling sex-specific patterns of parenchymal A{beta} pathology in humans.

With class I peptides, growth arrest is abrupt and predominantly coupled with inner membrane permeabilization and ribosome/DNA reorganization. However, membrane permeabilization leads to rapid peptide absorption by the first exposed bacterial cells, resulting in low efficacy against dense populations. With class II peptides, ribosome/DNA reorganization and growth inhibition occur more gradually, as inner membrane permeabilization is either absent or delayed.

Specifically, it focuses on a key characteristic of natural speech: the speech envelope. To achieve this, we employed two distinct measures. The first evaluates how effectively the patients brain activity \"tracks\" the speech envelope, called neural tracking. The second assesses the complexity of the brains responses to the speech stimulus, measured through spectral entropy. These two measures are then compared in their association with the patients clinical diagnosis and their level of behavioral responsiveness, both of which were assessed using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).\n\nDesignFour patients with DoC participated in this study, during which their brain activity was recorded using electroen-cephalography (EEG). At the same time, they listened to a narrated story in both Dutch and Swedish. Additionally, EEG baseline recordings were collected. We employed a backward modeling approach to evaluate the speech envelopes neural tracking. This technique involves training a model to map the relationship between EEG signals and the corresponding speech envelope. Once the model is trained, it can use unseen EEG data to reconstruct the speech envelope, which is then compared to the original speech envelope to assess how effectively the patient processed the auditory stimulus. For the behavioral assessment, we recalculated the CRS-R score of each patient into the CSR-R index, a more meaningful score that utilizes all the information contained in the CRS-R instead of only the highest scores on each subscale.\n\nResultsOur findings revealed positive correlations between spectral entropy and the CRS-R index, which were more pronounced during the listening conditions than the baseline. While neural tracking of the speech envelope did not correlate with the CRS-R index, it did exhibit a positive association with CRS-R diagnoses, indicating that patients with better clinical diagnoses demonstrated higher levels of neural tracking. Additionally, we identified an interaction effect between spectral entropy and neural tracking. Specifically, higher levels of neural tracking were associated with a stronger positive relationship between spectral entropy and the CRS-R index. In contrast, when neural tracking was lower, this relationship disappeared.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrated the potential of neural tracking and spectral entropy as complementary tools to investigate patients with DoC. Spectral entropy proved valuable for assessing behavioral responsiveness, while neural tracking shows promise in assessing the DoC diagnosis.

How and where the brain abstract numerical information from low-level sensory inputs remains debated. Using multivariate pattern decoding and representational similarity analysis applied to fMRI data, we comprehensively investigate how the brain represents numerical information (range 2-5) across different modalities (auditory, visual) and presentation formats (sequential, simultaneous; symbolic, non-symbolic). We identify a set of brain regions along the dorsal pathway -from early visual cortex to the intraparietal and frontal regions- that encode specific non-symbolic numerical information across formats and modalities. The numerical distance effect, a hallmark of magnitude encoding, was observed in most of these regions. We found aligned representation of numerical information across visual and auditory modalities in intraparietal and frontal regions, but only when they shared a sequential presentation format. Maintaining a distinction between spatial and temporal numerical representations may thus be a fundamental aspect of numerical processing. RSA further revealed a posterior-to-anterior gradient in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing that the dominant factors influencing distributed numerical representations shifted from sensory modality in the posterior parietal regions to presentation format in the anterior parietal areas.

Here, we show transcriptional responses specific to combinations of SA and JA concentrations and develop transcriptomic biomarkers to estimate SA/JA response states. Combinatorial treatments with eight concentrations of SA and JA, combined with large-scale transcriptome analysis, revealed 43 different expression patterns, including not only well-known antagonistic responses but also responses specific to combinations of SA/JA concentrations. Notably, the expression of CYP94B3, a key enzyme involved in JA-Ile turnover, was finely tuned by specific SA/JA concentration combinations being induced under high SA conditions in a JA dose-dependent manner. In addition, the expression peaks of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis genes were found at approximately 30-fold higher JA concentrations than aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, to quantitatively estimate SA/JA response states, we developed transcriptomic biomarkers using a machine learning approach. The marker specifically estimated response states to target phytohormones. Through analysis of npr3/4 double mutants, we confirmed that the biomarkers were applicable to the analysis of mutants.

Research has identified genetic loci and brain systems associated with different facets of impulsivity and risk-taking. However, how these genetic underpinnings overlap across different facets, and how they are associated with brain development during childhood remain unknown. Methods Using genomic structural equation modeling on 17 impulsivity and risk-taking traits, we identified latent factors capturing overlapping genetic architecture. We then calculated polygenic scores for these factors using Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study data (N = 4,142) and examined their associations with brain structure, development, and behavior in children aged 9-14 years. Finally, we tested whether socioeconomic status modulated the associations between latent polygenic scores and brain structures. Results We identified three distinct genetic latent factors, which we label lack of self-control, reward drive, and sensation seeking. In children, polygenic scores for the three factors showed associations with distinct brain patterns: lack of self-control associated with reduced prefrontal cortical thickness, reward drive with increased subcortical cellular density, and sensation seeking with increased cortical surface area and white matter integrity. Longitudinally, lack of self-control predicted slower white matter development. The association between polygenetic score for lack of self-control and white matter mean diffusivity was modulated by socioeconomic status. Conclusions We identified three genetically distinct dimensions of impulsivity and risk-taking with separable neurodevelopmental origins.

FGFR1-dependent brain colonization in young and aged mice occurs via canonical FGF2/FGFR1 signaling and non-canonical NCAM1/FGFR1 interactions. Astrocytic FGF2-mediated paracrine activation of FGFR1 promoted BCBMs in estrogen-treated young mice, but FGF2 signaling decreased in the brain with aging and estrogen-depletion. Neuronal and glial NCAM1, which remain unchanged in young and aged brains, promoted adhesion to neurons and migration of ER+ BC cells, suggesting that interactions with astrocytes and neurons facilitate early ER+ BCBM colonization through FGFR1.

It is suggested that HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) co-infection in tissues favours reciprocal replication, infection and reservoir expansion. Yet, confirmation of this detrimental synergism in diseased tissues is scant.\n\nMethodsIn a prospective study of 25 adults (13 (52%) people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) on antiretroviral treatment (ART)) undergoing spinal biopsy investigation for STB in South Africa, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to detect and quantify Mtb complex (MTBC) DNA (rpoB and IS6110) in 93 biopsy segments, and HIV-1 DNA (pol and gag) in 41 segments from PLWH. ddPCR sensitivity for Mtb was validated against Xpert-Ultra and culture. Relationships between pathogen DNA abundance, co-detection, human cellularity, HIV status, and peripheral viral load (VL) were evaluated.\n\nFindingsddPCR detected MTBC DNA in 19/25 (76%) patients (range: 8-59,144 rpoB copies/biopsy), with increased detection in those with confirmed STB and a history of TB. MTBC rpoB copies/million cells were higher in biopsies from PLWH (p=0.0096) and positively correlated with matched biopsy segment HIV-1 pol copies/million cells (r=0.40; p=0.0003), but not peripheral VL.

It was originally described in Drosophila mosaics, where heterozygous ribosomal protein (Rp+/-) mutant cells are eliminated by wild-type neighbors. The transcription factor Xrp1 mediates most of the Rp+/--associated phenotypes, including reduced competitiveness and translation. Although RpS12 is required for Xrp1 induction in Rp+/- cells, the mechanism remained unresolved. We demonstrate that RpS12, via alternative splicing, induces the Xrp1 short (Xrp1short) isoform expression in Rp+/- cells, which is both necessary and sufficient for their elimination. Strikingly, RpS12 overexpression in wild-type cells is sufficient to induce Xrp1short expression and confer a \"loser\" phenotype. While Xrp1long isoform is not required in Rp+/- cells, expression of either Xrp1 isoform is sufficient to promote the loser status in wild-type cells. We further identify Syncrip, an RNA-binding protein reduced in Rp+/- cells, as a critical Xrp1 suppressor; its depletion in wild-type cells activates Xrp1-dependent competition. Our findings establish RpS12's specialized function in Xrp1short promotion, not proteotoxic stress, as the primary driver in Rp+/- cells, providing new perspectives that challenge and refine prevailing models.

Compared to adult IBD, pediatric IBD frequently presents with distinct disease phenotypes, and is more commonly linked to rare monogenic variants that cause intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction or affect the function of mucosal immune cells. While more than 100 genes have been associated with early-onset IBD, the roles of many of these genes in the intestinal epithelium and the mechanisms by which genetic variants contribute to disease remain poorly defined.\n\nHere we aimed to improve our understanding of intestinal epithelium dysfunction in early-onset IBD by conducting extensive molecular and cellular characterization to gain insights into patient-specific epithelial phenotypes and identify therapeutic targets. We generated intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs) from 94 pediatric IBD patients, representing diverse clinical characteristics and including those with monogenic variants (BTK n=4, TTC7A n=3, IL10RA n=1, LRBA n=1, STXBP2 n=1, TTC37 n=1, TRNT1 n=1, PLCG2 n=1, DKC1 n=1, POLA1 n=1), and 46 non-IBD controls. This effort resulted in the largest RNA-seq dataset of pediatric IBD intestinal epithelial organoids to date, encompassing both baseline conditions and post-immunological stimulation, serving as a valuable resource for future research.\n\nWe observed that IEOs effectively initiate inflammation upon stimulation with bacterial lysate, regardless of disease status, origin, or mutation status. Inflammatory stimulation triggered single-gene upregulation of IBD-linked SERPINA1 and LIFR across the IBD population compared to controls, suggesting their role in intestinal epithelial innate immune responses. However, co-expression network analysis showed no consistent transcriptional signatures across the entire IBD group at the systems level.

In this work we focused on the polarity-sorting contraction mechanism and showed that connectivity is not determined by the spatial distribution of filaments alone, but by the interconnectivity between the dual network of filaments and motors. We developed a method to quantify filament-motor connectivity as a function of motor length, filament length distributions, and the densities of each component. Using this framework, we derived a general theory that predicts when a network is sufficiently connected to allow global or local contraction. We validated our predictions with computer simulations and introduced a novel metric to distinguish between these outcomes. Our findings show that the conditions for local and global contraction in the presence of fiber dynamics correspond, respectively, to the pulsatile and steady-state contraction behaviors observed in vivo. All results are independent of filament rigidity, making our conclusions applicable to both actin and microtubule networks.

Here, we investigate the spatial reorganization of SPP1-infected bacteria under near-native conditions by electron cryo tomography. The most prominent feature is the formation of a large viral DNA (vDNA) compartment from which ribosomes are excluded. In SPP1 infection, there is no membrane nor proteinaceous shell surrounding these compartments. Also, we identified novel key intermediates in virus assembly: open precursors of procapsid lattice were found at the cytoplasmic membrane in a process that requires expression of the portal protein. Next, DNA-free procapsids relocate inside the vDNA compartment where vDNA is packed in a stepwise manner. Finally, DNA-filled capsids segregate to the periphery of the compartment for assembly completion and storage.

Here, we present MOSAIC, a reconfigurable microscope that integrates multiple advanced imaging techniques including light-sheet, label-free, super-resolution, and multi-photon, all equipped with adaptive optics. MOSAIC enables non-invasive imaging of subcellular dynamics in both cultured cells and live multicellular organisms, nanoscale mapping of molecular architectures across millimeter-scale expanded tissues, and structural/functional neural imaging within live mice. MOSAIC facilitates correlative studies across biological scales within the same specimen, providing an integrated platform for broad biological investigation.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}
{"title": "CLUES2 Companion: Computational pipelines to estimate, visualize, and date selection on multi-locus sites", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.10.658975", "authors": "Lisi, A.; Campbell, M. C.", "abstract": "SummaryStatistical methods that quantify the selection coefficient associated with alleles provide critical insights into the evolutionary processes underlying organismal adaptation. Among these approaches, CLUES2 was recently developed to estimate selection coefficients for alleles using a statistical framework that captures the maximum amount of information present in genomic data, making it a state-of-the-art method for identifying variation under selection. However, before executing this approach, users first need to apply Relate, a genealogy-based approach, to their data to generate the input files for CLUES2. Moreover, completing this pre-processing step inherently assumes that users have sufficient expertise to successfully run the Relate software. Here, we present the CLUES2 Companion package, which contains user-friendly pipelines that seamlessly apply Relate to multiple sites within a target genomic region and then execute the CLUES2 software to estimate selection coefficients for these sites. CLUES2 Companion also has the capability to present the output of CLUES2 analyses in tabular and graphical formats. In addition, as a new feature, we adapted Relate and CLUES2 to estimate the age of onset of a selective sweep of derived variation, expanding the functionality of our package.\n\nResultsTo demonstrate the utility of our approach, we applied CLUES2 Companion to polymorphisms in the MCM6 gene on Chromosome 2 (including the known variants associated with lactase persistence) in the European Finnish, Middle Eastern Bedouin, and East African Maasai populations from the 1000 Genomes Project, the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), and the haplotype map (HapMap) Project Phase 3, respectively. Our analyses uncovered significant selection coefficient estimates at the persistence-associated T-13910 allele (rs4988235; s = 0.09986, CI: 0.08678 - 0.11294) in the Finnish, the G-13915 allele (rs41380347; s = 0.09981, CI: 0.06515 - 0.13448) in the Bedouin, and the C-14010 allele (rs145946881; s = 0.09981, CI: 0.08799 - 0.11163) in the Maasai, indicative of a classic selective sweep. Furthermore, we inferred the age of onset of selection at these alleles to be 9,100 years ago (CI: 6,552 - 10,612 years ago) in the Finnish, 7,700 years ago (CI: 1,864 - 8,064 years ago) in the Bedouin, and 4,900 years ago (CI: 3,864 - 5,936 years ago) in the Maasai, respectively, which coincide well with other estimates based on genetic and archaeological data. To further validate our dating method, we simulated several datasets containing SNPs with known ages of onset of selection, s estimates, and genomic positions using a selective sweep framework implemented in msprime and then applied CLUES2 Companion to the simulated datasets. Using this approach, CLUES2 Companion produced similar estimates of selection onset as the ones specified in the simulations, corroborating the dependability of our method. Overall, CLUES2 Companion is a versatile package that enables users to efficiently explore, interpret, and report evidence of selection in genomic datasets, complementing the CLUES2 software.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationCLUES2 Companion is free and open source on GitHub (https://github.com/alisi1989/CLUES2-Companion) and on DropBox (https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/m5y6aek0twd1jz9grg4p3/ALxMgIljUJRIZZNQXaGU-OE?rlkey=mbbh36ondftnqg0x07eao57eg&st=9jzsl5um&dl=0).\n\nContactalisi@usc.edu; mc44680@usc.edu", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

However, accurate estimation of diffusion parameters from single-particle trajectories remains challenging due to static and dynamic localization errors inherent in these measurements. While previous studies have characterized how such errors affect mean-squared displacement (MSD) analysis, practical guidelines for minimizing them during data acquisition and correcting them during analysis are still lacking. Here, we combine theoretical modeling and simulations to evaluate how exposure time and sampling rate influence the accuracy of MSD-based inference under fractional Brownian motion (FBM), a canonical model of anomalous diffusion. We demonstrate that decoupling exposure and sampling times enables escape from the error-prone regime, thus improving inference accuracy, and that incorporating an offset in nonlinear MSD fitting substantially improves the estimation of the anomalous diffusion exponent. We validate this framework using trajectories of cytoplasmic particles in Escherichia coli, recovering consistent diffusion parameters across multiple data sets.

Research is hampered by the limitations of primary patient-derived cells, which are obtained through invasive methods and have finite proliferative capacity and high variability. While induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models exist, direct differentiation to osteoblasts is often inefficient and may not fully replicate disease characteristics. Our study aimed to develop and characterize a robust iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cell (iMSC) model of OI using a simple two-step differentiation protocol to serve as a platform for disease modeling and drug screening.\n\nMethodsBone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs) were isolated from two OI patients with heterozygous missense mutations, in COL1A1 (c.2299G >A) and COL1A2 (c.982G>A). The patient BMMSCs were reprogrammed into iPSCs using an integration-free Sendai virus. The resulting OI-iPSCs were characterized for pluripotency via immunofluorescence and RT-PCR, trilineage differentiation potential, and karyotype analysis. A two-step protocol was used to differentiate the OI-iPSCs into OI-iMSCs via mesodermal lineage. The OI-iMSCs were then characterized for morphology, immunophenotype by flow cytometry, and trilineage differentiation capacity. Functional osteogenic differentiation was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining and RT-PCR analysis of key osteogenic genes. Sanger sequencing confirmed the retention of patient-specific mutations in the OI-iMSCs.\n\nResultsPatient-derived BMMSCs were successfully differentiated into adipocytes and chondrocytes but showed impaired osteogenic potential. The reprogramming process successfully generated stable OI-iPSC lines that expressed key pluripotency markers, demonstrated trilineage potential, and maintained a normal karyotype. Critically, while direct osteogenic differentiation of these iPSCs failed to recapitulate the primary cell phenotype, the two-step differentiation protocol successfully produced a homogeneous population of iMSCs. These OI-iMSCs displayed characteristics of MSC surface markers (CD73+, CD90+, CD105+) and recapitulated the disease phenotype seen in the original patient BMMSCs. Specifically, COL1A1-iMSCs exhibited cellular rolling and detachment, while COL1A2-iMSCs showed poor mineralization during osteogenic differentiation. Both OI-iMSC lines showed significantly decreased calcium deposition and downregulation of key osteogenic genes (RUNX2, ALP, COL1) compared to controls.\n\nConclusionOur study successfully established an iMSC-based cellular model of OI that recapitulates patient-specific disease phenotypes, including impaired osteogenic differentiation. The two-stage differentiation of iPSCs to iMSCs proved more reliable than direct osteogenic differentiation for modeling the disease. iMSC model circumvents the limitations of primary cells by providing a scalable and homogeneous source of patient-specific cells. Our platform offers a valuable and robust tool for investigating OI pathophysiology and for high-throughput screening of potential therapeutic molecules, advancing efforts toward personalized therapies", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

This paper proposes a unified approach, D-CoMEx, to mine miRNA biomarkers from dysregulated pathways associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) and Breast Cancer (BC). The approach integrates a co-expression network (CEN) module extraction technique with a differential analysis method to capture interactions between miRNAs and dysregulated pathways.

Methods: A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established using the filament occlusion method to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LBP on pathological brain tissue damage after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R). Mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham surgery (Sham), I/R, and I/R + LBP. Behavioral tests, including the Y-maze test, rotarod test, and balance beam test, were systematically conducted to assess the impact of LBP on neurobehavioral impairments. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify peripheral blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), reflecting inflammatory status. Results: LBP significantly ameliorated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in mice with cerebral I/R injury, demonstrating marked protection against I/R-induced neurofunctional damage. LBP notably improved motor and memory deficits caused by ischemic stroke. Compared to the I/R group, LBP improved neuroinflammation and oxidative stress levels post-I/R injury.

Using both model simulations and empirical data, we demonstrate that dynamic contributions are generically unrelated to their biomasses and traits associated with the function, but rather reflect a species' overall effect on others, and the level of functioning in the community without that species.

While this concept was described decades ago, we still know relatively little about how canalization is influenced by environmental stress, how it is shaped by natural selection, and the genetic underpinnings of canalization. In this study, we examined natural selection on microenvironmental canalization in rice (Oryza sativa) in wet and dry field conditions. We measured developmental stability in genetically identical replicates obtained from geographically widespread Indica and Japonica rice accessions, providing precise estimates of canalization in thousands of plants. We found that drought stress decreased canalization, showing that stress can increase instability. We also found evidence that canalization can evolve, given that canalization of several traits was heritable and under selection. We further uncovered specific genes underlying canalization, with genetic mapping and functional genetic experiments showing that the bZIP transcription factor-encoding gene OsTGA5/rTGA2.3, which is part of a module that balances stress response and plant growth, regulates canalization of several traits in an environment-dependent manner. At a genome-wide scale, canalization was associated with lower gene expression stochasticity at an earlier life stage, indicating that expression variation can reduce canalization and increase instability. Trait canalization was also positively correlated to temperature at accessions' source environments, suggesting that selection on canalization can vary among environments. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the molecular genetic basis of environmental differences in developmental stability and how it might be shaped by selection.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Faculty offer multiple reasons for not using active learning with many expressing confusion as to what active learning is. Contributing to that confusion is the fact there are a multitude of named active learning methods and varied implementations of each. In an effort to better understand how specific elements of active learning might contribute to enhanced academic performance, we used a more fine-grained classroom observation tool, PORTAAL, to observe teaching practices across 157 STEM courses. We used a principal component analysis to reduce the observed teaching practices to specific sets of practices. We found a continuum of implementation of teaching practices that ranged from instruction-centered to learner-centered. The instruction-centered practices included high Blooms level questions, students working alone, instructors answering and explaining questions, and providing alternative answers. The learner-centered practices were volunteer or randomly-called students explaining answers, instructors prompting students logic, and instructors giving positive feedback. Using a linear regression to analyze the data from all courses, we found medium and medium-high levels of learner-centered teaching practices correlated with higher student exam performance compared to instruction-centered practices. We observed a similar pattern when analyzing data only from introductory courses. We also analyzed interactions of both binary gender and first generation status with learner-centered teaching on exam scores. We propose that when instructors use the learner-centered practices, they shift the responsibility of the intellectual work of the problem-the learning-to the students, which may result in improved exam performance. Even moderate levels of these learner-centered practices have a positive correlation with exam performance.

The study investigates the feasibility, safety, and therapeutic potential of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in ameliorating central hypomyelination, reducing excessive glutamatergic transmission in cortical neurons following neonatal intermittent hypoxia (IH), and improving behavioral outcomes. In the mouse model of neonatal intermittent hypoxia, low-frequency (LF-rTMS) stimulation at 1 Hz or high-frequency (HF-rTMS) at 10 Hz stimulation was applied for 5 days shortly after the IH injury.

HF-rTMS significantly ameliorated hypomyelination in the corticospinal tract, with a larger increase in MPF in the stimulated hemisphere and also in the contralateral hemisphere. LF-rTMS reduced locomotor hyperactivity in female IH mice and decreased elevated glutamatergic synaptic excitability in motor cortex slices.

M.; Lehmann, O. J.", "abstract": "Cancer repeatedly exploits attributes fundamental for morphogenesis to advance malignancy and metastasis. This is illustrated by lineage specific transcription factors that regulate neural crest migration representing frequent drivers of malignancy. One such example is the forkhead transcription factor FOXC1 where gain of function is a feature of diverse cancers that is associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Using RNA-, ChIP-sequencing and CRISPR interference, we show that Foxc1 binds a locus in a region of closed chromatin to induce expression of Arhgap36, a tissue-specific inhibitor of Protein Kinase A. Because PKA is a core Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitor, Foxc1's induction of Arhgap36 expression increases Hh activity. The function of Sufu, a PKA substrate and a second essential Hh pathway inhibitor, is likewise impaired. The resulting increased Hh pathway output is resistant to pharmacological inhibition of Smoothened, a phenotype of more aggressive cancers. The Foxc1-Arhgap36 relationship identified in murine cells was further evaluated in neuroblastoma, a neural crest derived pediatric malignancy. This demonstrated in a cohort of 1348 patients that high levels of ARHGAP36 are predictive of improved five-year survival. In individual neuroblastoma cell lines that express high levels of ARHGAP36, the acute suppression of ARHGAP36 by shRNA inhibition induced apoptosis and rapid cell death. Accordingly, this study has identified as a novel transcription factor which enhances ARHGAP36 expression, one that induces Hh activity in multiple tissues during development. It also establishes a model by which increased levels of FOXC1 via ARHGAP36 and PKA inhibition, dysregulate multiple facets of Hh signaling, and provides evidence demonstrating relevance to a common neural-crest derived malignancy.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Treating epimutation rates as quantitative molecular traits, we mapped a major QTL to a Cvi-derived deletion near VIM2 and VIM4, two genes involved in CG methylation (mCG) maintenance. We show that this deletion rapidly reduces genome-wide methylation to a lower steady-state and compromises mCG maintenance fidelity across generations, resulting in a ~1.5-fold increase in epimutation rates.

Somatic mutations displayed elevated signatures consistent with oxidative damage, UV damage, and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Both somatic and germline mutations were enriched in transposable elements and depleted in genes, but this depletion was greater in germline mutations. Somatic mutation rate correlated with proximity to the centromere, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene/TE content, properties which were also largely true of germline mutations. We note DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility have different predicted effects on mutation rate for genic and non-genic regions; DNA methylation associates with a greater increase in mutation rate when in non-genic regions, and accessible chromatin associates with a lower mutation rate in non-genic regions but a higher mutation rate in genic regions.

Single cell gene regulatory networks (scGRNs) were generated for each cluster through GENIE3, identifying many shared and unique transcription factor (TF) target interactions across clusters. A close examination of CCA1 targets identified Photosystem II repair components in a subset of mesophyll cells and a large number of auxin-associated genes in only a handful of clusters despite robust expression in other clusters, suggestive of cell type-specific CCA1 target regulation. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the extent to which circadian transcriptional regulation is present in the mature Arabidopsis leaf, and highlight the immense complexity in cell type specific regulation. This dataset provides a high-resolution resource for dissecting circadian gene regulation at cellular resolution and advances our understanding of tissue-specific clock dynamics in plants.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Despite the prevalence of transient expression in disciplines such as synthetic biology, little work has been done to describe and address the variability inherent in this system, a concern for experiments that rely on highly quantitative readouts. In a comprehensive analysis of N. benthamiana agroinfiltration experiments, we model sources of variability that affect transient expression. Our findings emphasize the need to validate normalization methods under the specific conditions of each study, as distinct normalization schemes do not always reduce variation either within or between experiments. Using a dataset of 1,813 plants collected over three years, we develop a comprehensive model of variation in N. benthamiana transient expression, using power analysis to determine the number of individual plants required for a given effect size. Drawing on our longitudinal data, these findings inform practical guidelines for minimizing variability through strategic experimental design and power analysis, providing a foundation for more robust and reproducible use of N. benthamiana in quantitative plant biology and synthetic biology applications.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

When applying m5C-Rol-LAMP to E. coli under heat stress (45{degrees}C), we observe a site-specific increase of m5C at position 1407 of 16S rRNA from 77% to 89%, while m5C levels at positions 967 (16S) and 1962 (23S) remain unchanged. In recovered cells (at 37{degrees}C), the m5C abundance partially returns to the no-stress level. Under oxidative stress, the level of m5C1407 also increases, but remains high in recovered cells. These results demonstrate for the first time a reversible, stress-dependent, and site-specific change in the rRNA modification level of a bacterium. m5C-Rol-LAMP is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for studying m5C in all RNA species, allowing the quantitative and site-specific detection of this modification.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Some strains, such as the kurstaki HD1, a parent of commercial strains, also release insecticidal proteins Cry1I and Vip3A in the extracellular medium. vip3A gene expression is activated by the transcriptional regulator VipR at the onset of the stationary phase. Here, we expanded the VipR regulon to all the insecticidal-encoding genes of strain HD1 by identifying the VipR-binding box and conducting transcription assays. Unexpectedly, a VipR box was located in the promoter region of a putative N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase gene upstream cry1Acin strain kurstaki HD73, closely related to the HD1 but devoid of vipR. We demonstrated that introducing a functional vipR in this strain leads to the expression of the amidase-cry1Ac operon, resulting in an early and increased production of Cry1Ac. Investigating this phenotype, we showed that Cry1Ac was produced in a VipR-dependent manner in an HD73 {Delta}spo0A mutant. Similarly, an HD1{Delta}spo0A strain forms insecticidal crystals and produces all the insecticidal proteins encoded in its genome, including cry2Ab previously considered unexpressed in strain HD1. Finally, a genomic analysis revealed the presence of putative VipR-binding sequences upstream from insecticidal protein-encoding genes in several biopesticidal strains. Overall, our results break the dogma on the regulation of cry1A and cry2A genes and provide evidence of sporulation-independent Cry toxin production in biopesticidal Bt strains.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "The faithful reassortment and transmission of chromosomes across generations is fundamental to species survival. While much is known about chromosome pairing and recombination, the upstream regulators controlling entry into the meiotic program remain largely elusive. In many species, including Drosophila and mammals, the decision to enter meiosis occurs prior to premeiotic DNA replication and is governed by post-transcriptional regulation, by yet to be discovered factors. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein Ataxin-2 as a crucial and previously unrecognized regulator of meiotic entry. We show that Ataxin-2 acts post-transcriptionally to promote the entry into meiosis by downregulating the conserved cell cycle inhibitor Dacapo, the Drosophila ortholog of p21/p27. In the absence of Ataxin-2, germ cells mis-regulate Dacapo leading to delayed premeiotic DNA replication and sterility. Strikingly, when DNA replication is delayed and extends into the next stage of meiosis, synaptonemal complex formation, oocytes incur severe genomic DNA damage, likely caused by collisions between replication forks and the synaptonemal complex. Our findings establish Ataxin-2 as a pivotal factor in regulating premeiotic DNA replication and safeguarding oocyte genome stability, shedding new light on the intricate regulatory mechanisms that ensure successful meiosis and fertility.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular mechanisms by which DNA methylation regulates the biosynthesis of iridoid glycosides in R. glutinosa remain unknown. Herein, the development of R. glutinosa roots and the content of iridoid glycosides in the Wenxian region were significantly higher than those in Xinxiang. Low methylation level contributed to the accumulation of iridoid glycosides and the expression of related enzyme genes. Demethylation promoted both roots growth and development, as well as the accumulation of iridoid glycosides. Up-regulated RgALDH13, RgHDR1, RgG10H4, RgDXR1, RgG10H3, and RgUPD1, along with transcription factors (TFs), form the regulatory network for the biosynthesis of iridoid glycosides. Furthermore, the primary active region of the RgG10H4 promoter is located in the -164 bp region, where the RgMYB2 protein specifically binds to the TAACCA motif in the RgG10H4 promoter. Collectively, low levels of DNA methylation enhance the expression of core genes, followed by inducing the accumulation of iridoid glycosides, which suggests that RgMYB2-RgG10H4 plays a positive role in this process.

Anglers reported age 1 and 2 rainbow and cutthroat trout identified by size distribution, estimated from a provincial database, across 4 sub-watersheds with varying densities of Myxobolus cerebralis actinospores (TAMs), a known predictor of WD severity.

However, their cellular permeability is hindered by strong electrostatic repulsion from negatively charged cellular membranes, posing a significant obstacle to the use of DNA nanostructures as a drug delivery vehicle. Recent experimental studies have shown enhanced cellular uptake for the conjugate binary mixtures of DNA Tetrahedron (TDN) with cationic lipid N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) compared to TDN alone. However, the cationic DOTMA lipids binding mechanism with the TDN nucleotides is still elusive. Using fully atomistic MD simulations, we aim to understand the molecular interactions that drive the formation and stability of the TDN-DOTMA binary complexes in a physiological environment. Our results uncovered that lipid concentration plays a crucial role in the energetics of the TDN-DOTMA association. We also report that distinct timescales are associated with the self-assembly of cationic DOTMA lipids first, followed by the complexation of self-assembled DOTMA lipid clusters with the TDN nucleotides, where electrostatics, hydrophobicity, and hydrogen bonding are the key interactions that drive the formation and stability of these complexes.

Mean rewarming rates are used to establish the exposure time to rewarm to 5{degrees}C for higher power (100 W) and lower power (20 W) ultrasonic rewarming.

In this study, we used the LncBook catalog (>95,000 lncRNAs) to identify over 12,500 lncRNAs with expression evidence across major TCGA cancer types. These were stratified by clinical annotations, including cancer stage (I-IV) and metastatic state (M0/M1). Using significant differential expression (z-score >|3|) for consecutive transitions, we identified a set of influential transitional lncRNAs (Tr-lncRNAs) that signify cancer transitions. Analyzing seven transitions revealed that over 70% of Tr-lncRNAs were cancer-type specific, while only 2-4% were shared across 17 major cancers. Each cancer type had 30-80 Tr-lncRNAs, with more than half uniquely expressed in one type. Most Tr-lncRNAs were previously uncharacterized. A pan-cancer analysis revealed 14 shared Tr-lncRNAs, including known ones such as XIST and H19.

P.", "abstract": "In the healthy mammary gland serotonin (5-HT) has a key role in shaping tissue morphology and regulating lactation and involution. Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) alter the distribution of 5-HT across the cell membrane, but how increased extracellular 5-HT may impact breast cell homeostasis is unclear. We demonstrate that paroxetine reduces 5-HT levels in immortalized primary breast epithelial (HME-hTert) cells, mitigates free oxygen radical formation and decreases cell migration and proliferation. Accordingly, pathways related to cell cycle and DNA damage repair were underrepresented in the transciptomic profile of paroxetine-treated cells. On the other hand, enriched transcipts overrepresented genes affecting neural transmission and GPCR signaling, suggesting an increase in 5-HT receptor (5HTR) activation. As 5-HT induced the levels of both cAMP and inositol triphosphate (IP3), the contribution of individual 5HTRs were decyphered using receptor-selective agonists and antagonists. 5HTRs coupled to each Galpha protein subtype were expressed and functional in HME-hTert cells. The activation of GS-coupled receptor 5HTR7 and antagonists of Gi- and Gq-coupled receptors 5HTR1D and 5HTR2B generally suppressed proliferation. The induction of cAMP levels by 5-HT was reduced by the 5HTR7 antagonist and IP3 induction was blocked by an 5HTR2B inhibitor, while the 5HTR1D antagonist further increased cAMP levels induced by 5-HT. Paroxetine-dependent growth suppression was reversed by inhibitors of GS-coupled 5HTR7, protein kinase A or adenylyl cyclase, and agonists of Gi or Gq-coupled receptors. These results suggest that the anti-proliferative responses to 5-HT in non-malignant breast cells align with the G protein preference of the receptors, and reveal potential benefits of repurposing receptor subtype-selective agents and SSRIs for cancer risk reduction.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

To functionally monitor the barrier integrity during the experiments, we introduced a panel of marker compounds, whose concentration kinetics on either side of the epithelial monolayer indicates barrier integrity and transport. We employed this workflow to systematically probe the effect of different gut bacterial species on the epithelial absorption of 482 drugs and their 172 bacterially produced metabolites. While we could recapitulate known bacterial drug biotransformation reactions and expected drug metabolite absorption profiles, we also identified 33 new bacteria-drug pairs for which bacterial biotransformation alters epithelial permeability. Further, we combined the developed experimental workflow with untargeted metabolomics analysis to systematically study epithelial permeability of metabolites naturally produced by gut bacteria. Tracking the absorption kinetics of 397 bacterially produced metabolites revealed that the majority (>79%) of these metabolites do not pass the Caco2 monolayer, illustrating its role as a physical and metabolic barrier.

Here, we used a murine model of Influenza A virus (Flu) infection to determine how IL-2 mutein shapes T cell responses to respiratory virus infection. IL-2 mutein administration prior to infection suppressed Flu-specific (Flu-sp) CD8 T cell responses and altered their localization and phenotype within the lungs, without affecting bystander CD8 T cells. This suppression correlated with reduced antigen presentation molecule expression on conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) early after infection but did not impact Flu-sp CD8 T cell priming. In contrast, administering IL-2 mutein during infection exacerbated disease and drove CD25-dependent expansion of Flu-sp CD8 T cells. Despite these opposing effects on effector responses, Fc.Mut24-treated mice generated robust antibody responses and protective T cell memory which were maintained for at least 170 days. These findings reveal that Fc.Mut24 has temporally distinct effects on antiviral immunity, dampening early effector responses when given before infection, but enhancing effector expansion and disease severity when delivered during infection.

Drosophila has been used as a model organism to further understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie exercise adaptation. Essential for flies ability to adapt to exercise, octopamine is a hormone and neurotransmitter found in invertebrates that is analogous to norepinephrine. Interestingly, octopamine is also crucial for female post mating responses, and no studies to date have explored the interaction between exercise response and reproductive state in females. Here, we investigated the sexual dimorphism in exercise response by exercising male and female flies of multiple Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP) lines and measuring fitness traits such as climbing ability and starvation resistance. Further, we were interested in how mating status might affect females ability to adapt to exercise, and whether the stress of exercise would affect fertility. Our findings show that while male flies are naturally faster climbers than female flies, females tend to be better suited to resist starvation. Additionally, we found that mating status has a significant impact on female flies climbing performance and lifespan, and exercise can have negative effects on lifespan and fertility. Surprisingly, we found that exercise has little effect on stored triglycerides, protein levels, or gene expression. DGRP genetic line was also a significant factor that influenced most phenotypes we measured, underscoring the importance of studying multiple genotypes in conjunction with other experimental variables.

Despite this, systematic functional interrogation in human models has been limited. Here, we combine pooled CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens with high-throughput single-cell multiomic profiling in hiPSC-derived neural progenitors and neurons to functionally assess 65 schizophrenia-associated genes. Based on public datasets and literature review, we selected 55 TFs and CRs, along with ten additional risk genes whose loss-of-function has been linked to schizophrenia. Our single-cell CRISPRi readouts revealed that perturbations in TFs and CRs converge on disrupting neurodevelopmental timing. CRISPRi of several factors delayed neural differentiation, whereas others, such as the knockdown of MCRS1, drove precocious neural commitment. Validation screens combined with cell cycle and metabolic indicators confirmed the differentiation-restricting or -promoting roles of these TFs and CRs. Multimodal trajectory analysis uncovered discrete transcriptional and epigenomic states representing delayed and accelerated neurodevelopment, enriched for schizophrenia GWAS loci and disease-relevant pathways. Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference identified TCF4 and ZEB1 as critical mediators opposing the neural differentiation trajectory. Functional overexpression of these TFs followed by chromatin profiling demonstrated that TCF4 restrains, while ZEB1 promotes, neural differentiation in a stage-specific and competitive manner. Furthermore, we show that MCRS1 represses ZEB1 expression, positioning MCRS1 as a key brake on premature neurodevelopment. Together, our study establishes a scalable framework that integrates genetic perturbation, single-cell multiomics, and GRN modeling to functionally annotate disease-linked genes.

Our data support a model where, in response to the apoptotic trigger, Brahma and CSL-Su(H)/Mastermind complex recruit CBP/p300 onto the apoptotic enhancer, thereby increasing the H3K27ac marks on the nucleosomes to facilitate apoptotic gene transcription.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

While these have the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discoveries by creating AI-driven virtual cell models, their progress has been greatly limited by the lack of large-scale high-quality perturbation data, which remains constrained due to scalability bottlenecks and assay variability. Here, we introduce \"Fix-Cryopreserve-ScRNAseq\" (FiCS) Perturb-seq, an industrialized platform for scalable Perturb-seq data generation. We demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq exhibits high sensitivity and low batch effects, effectively capturing perturbation-induced transcriptomic changes and recapitulating known biological pathways and protein complexes. In addition, we release X-Atlas: Orion edition (X-Atlas/Orion), the largest publicly available Perturb-seq atlas. This atlas, generated from two genome-wide FiCS Perturb-seq experiments targeting all human protein-coding genes, comprises eight million cells deeply sequenced to over 16,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. Furthermore, we show that single guide RNA (sgRNA) abundance can serve as a proxy for gene knockdown (KD) efficacy. Leveraging the deep sequencing and substantial cell numbers per perturbation, we also show that stratification by sgRNA expression can reveal dose-dependent genetic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq is an efficient and scalable platform for high-throughput Perturb-seq screens. Through the release of X-Atlas/Orion, we highlight the potential of FiCS Perturb-seq to address current scalability and variability challenges in data generation, advance foundation model development that incorporates gene-dosage effects, and accelerate biological discoveries.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

A quantitative proteomic analysis was therefore performed across three experimental treatments (low pCO2/high pH, high pCO2/low pH, low pCO2/low pH) to discern the specific roles of proteins that can be involved in CCMs as well as other cellular processes (e.g. pH and redox regulation). This analysis revealed a hybrid CCM consisting of both biophysical and biochemical steps that facilitate increased CO2 diffusion into the cell, the formation and transport of an organic carbon intermediate into the chloroplast, the subsequent decarboxylation of this intermediate, and the facilitated diffusion of inorganic carbon from the stroma into the pyrenoid-penetrating thylakoid. No evidence supporting alternative roles for the identified CCM proteins was found. As several aspects of this CCM require further investigation, common challenges inherent to CCM research are discussed and strategies to overcome them are suggested.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Here we show that two members of the delta-catenin protein family, p120 and plakophilin 4 (pkp4), which interact with the juxtamembrane intracellular region of classic cadherins, promote distinct types of cadherin clustering thereby contributing to AJ specialization. The type controlled by p120 is driven by interactions between cadherin-associated protein, -catenin, and actin filaments. This canonical clustering mechanism results in formation of AJs that play a major role in overall cell-cell adhesion. The type promoted by pkp4 is driven by an -catenin-independent cadherin-F-actin interaction. It generates the so-called lateral spot AJs, which apparently function in processes other than cell-cell adhesion.

However, deletion of upstream enzyme BCAT2 neither phenocopied nor rescued loss of DBT in KC mice, ruling out involvement of both upstream and downstream metabolites as mediators of PanIN promotion. Instead, we observed that DBT deficiency led to loss of the kinase BCKDK, a negative regulator of the BCKDH complex, and that, remarkably, pancreas-specific loss of BCKDK phenocopied DBT deficiency in accelerating PanIN formation. These data thus support a model in which pancreas BCKDK restrains tumorigenesis. In contrast, systemic treatment of KC mice with the BCKDK inhibitor BT2, which inhibits BCKDH phosphorylation across many tissues except the pancreas, reduced PanIN formation and preserved normal acinar area.

While unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria have been extensively characterized, the chloroplast UPR (cpUPR) remains less defined, partly due to the off-target effects of traditional stress-inducing methods. In this study, we provide direct evidence for the existence of the cpUPR by expressing engineered, folding-defective variants of ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) in plant chloroplasts. The expression of aggregation-prone proteins inside the organelle triggered a robust upregulation of chloroplast quality control components, including CLPB3, CLPC1/C2, and HSP90C, as revealed by immunodetection and quantitative proteomics. The proteomic response scaled with the severity of the folding defect, with the fully insoluble FNR {Delta}20 variant inducing broader changes than the partially soluble {Delta}3 variant. Network analysis showed that most differentially abundant proteins were chloroplastic and clustered into functional groups related to proteostasis and photosynthesis. Comparative analysis with lincomycin-treated plants highlighted the specificity and advantages of using misfolded proteins to study the cpUPR. Expression of the folding variants conferred tolerance to heat treatment, suggesting that the response can enhance plant fitness.

Herein, we aimed to explore the role of organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis glutamatergic neurons (OVLTGlut) and their hyperexcitability mechanisms in hyperaldosteronism-associated hypertension. Methods: Adult age matched male TASK-/- mice (primary aldosteronism model) and wild-type controls (TASK+/+) mice were used. Neuronal excitability was assessed via patch-clamp techniques. Arterial blood pressure (BP) monitored via telemetry or carotid catheterization. Chronic drug delivery used minipumps. RNA-seq/qPCR profiled gene expression, and intracerebroventricular hypertonic saline tested sodium sensitivity. Results: In TASK-/- mice, heightened OVLTGlut activity increased sympathetic outflow and hypertension, mitigated by OVLTGlut neuron ablation. Optogenetic activation of these neurons or their paraventricular nucleus (PVN) / rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) projections acutely elevated BP, with ablation reducing BP selectively in TASK-/- mice. Aldosterone dependence of OVLTGlut-PVN/RVLM neuron hyperactivity was evident in both TASK-/- mice and TASK+/+ mice with chronic aldosterone infusion. Aldosterone chronic infusion enhanced central sodium pressor effects, that were nullified by OVLTGlut-PVN/RVLM neuron lesioning. RNA-seq indicated that aldosterone-induced ion channel expression spectrum changes, including potassium channels and the epithelial sodium channel, underlie the neuronal hyperexcitability. Conclusion: Overactivation of OVLTGlut neurons contributes to hypertension in TASK-/- mice through regulation of OVLTGlut-PVN/RVLM circuits. The hyperexcitability of these neurons, possibly due to aldosterone-induced changes in ion channel expression spectrum, contribute to hypertension by amplifying central sodium sensitivity.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

However, these tests in many cases do not have the desired levels of selectivity and/or sensitivity or even in some cases introduce an unwanted degree of subjectivity and thus uncertainty. Here, we developed a novel lateral flow analysis test designed for easy-to-run and easily to-interpret detection implementing surface enhanced Raman scattering. The strip utilizes modular polymeric sections specifically engineered to simplify the separation of target analytes from complex biological samples. This separation relies on a series of carefully designed physicochemical interactions between the sample components and the polymeric materials embedded in the strip. A key feature of this detection method is an analytical area on the strip that incorporates plasmonic silver nanostructures with a possibility of further surface functionalization using various selectors.

Excessive osteoclast activity leads to bone loss and contributes to conditions like osteoporosis. Osteoclasts form a specialized adhesion structure called the actin ring that is crucial for bone resorption and relies on both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Our previous studies identified the {beta}-tubulin isotype TUBB6 as a regulator of actin ring dynamics essential for osteoclast function, and found ARHGAP10, a negative regulator of the GTPases CDC42 and RHOA, as a potential mediator of TUBB6 function. Here we show that ARHGAP10 as a novel microtubule-associated protein critical for osteoclast function. ARHGAP10 directly binds microtubules through its BAR-PH domain, which requires positively-charged lysine residues K37, K41 and K44 within the BAR domain. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of Arhgap10 affects the morphology of actin ring and impairs osteoclast resorption activity, correlated with altered actin ring dynamics. Complementation experiments reveal that the ability of ARHGAP10 to bind microtubules is essential for its role in osteoclast resorption activity. These findings uncover a novel cytoskeletal regulator in osteoclast and suggest that targeting the microtubule-actin interface via ARHGAP10 could represent a therapeutic strategy in bone loss disorder.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

In various pathological contexts associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, this enzyme can reverse its function to maintain essential mitochondrial membrane potential at the expense of ATP. This reversal is regulated by the conserved protein Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1). Here, we demonstrate that ATP synthase reversal also occurs under physiological conditions during the cellular differentiation of the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which transitions between insect and mammalian hosts. Differentiation of the insect forms is marked by upregulation of alternative oxidase (AOX) along with decreased expression of trypanosomal IF1 (TbIF1), collectively creating a metabolic environment conducive to ATP synthase reversal. We show that this reversal is key for proper parasite differentiation: parasites lacking TbIF1 efficiently transitioned into the mammalian-infective form. In these TbIF1 knockout parasites, ATP synthase reversal was associated with an increased ADP/ATP ratio, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, enhanced cellular respiration driven by elevated proline metabolism, and increased mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), known signaling molecules. Conversely, parasites with inducible TbIF1 overexpression failed to reverse ATP synthase activity, showed no AMPK activation or ROS elevation, and remained locked in the initial insect stage. Our findings highlight the critical role of TbIF1 downregulation in enabling life cycle progression and underscore the unique function of the ATP synthase/IF1 axis in cellular signaling.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Here we tagged endogenous BLM and PICH with fluorescent proteins and BLM with an auxin-inducible degron to generate a cell model system that enables temporal tracking of UFB dynamics in the presence or absence of BLM. Time-resolved lattice light sheet microscopy established the dynamic localization patterns of BLM and PICH throughout the cell cycle. While BLM cycles between PML bodies and DNA repair foci in interphase, it dissociates from chromatin at the mitotic entry, and re-associates during anaphase to UFBs as well as to CENP-B-positive mitotic foci. Acute BLM depletion during mitosis increased the fraction of unresolved UFBs, micronuclei containing acentric fragments, binucleation, and resulted in subtle genomic abnormalities detected by single-cell whole genome sequencing.

This simplification potentially limits these models from making accurate predictions in situations where charged tRNAs become limiting. Here, we derive a mathematical model of translation with explicit tRNA dynamics and tRNA re-charging, based on a stochastic simulation of this system that was previously applied to investigate codon usage in the context of gene overexpression. We use the mathematical model to systematically explore the relationship between codon usage and the protein expression rate, and find that in the regime where tRNA charging is a limiting reaction, it is always optimal to match codon frequencies to the tRNA pool. Conversely, when tRNA charging is not limiting, using 100% of the preferred codon is optimal for protein production. We also use the tRNA dynamics model to augment a whole-cell simulation of bacteriophage T7. Using this model, we demonstrate that recoding the major capsid gene in T7 causes rare charged tRNAs to become depleted, which leads to the observed reduction in protein expression and phage fitness.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

One key factor believed to support this ability is sparse coding, which can reduce overlap between representations and minimize interference. It is well known that increased sparseness can enhance memory capacity, yet its impact on the speed of learning remains poorly understood. Here we analyze the relationship between population sparseness and learning speed -- specifically, how the learning speed that maximizes memory capacity depends on the sparseness of the neural code, and how this in turn affects the networks maximal capacity. To this end, we study a feedforward network with Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity and a two-state synapse model. The network learns to associate binary input-output pattern pairs, where sparseness corresponds to a small fraction of active neurons per pattern. The learning speed is modeled as the probability of synaptic changes during learning. The results presented in this manuscript are based on both network simulations and an analytical theory that predicts expected memory capacity and optimal learning speed. For both perfect and noisy retrieval cues, we find that the optimal learning speed indeed increases with increasing pattern sparseness -- an effect that is more pronounced for input sparseness than for output sparseness. Interestingly, the optimal learning speed stays the same across different network sizes if the number of active units in an input pattern is kept constant. While the capacity obtained at optimal learning speed increases monotonically with output sparseness, its dependence on input sparseness is non-monotonic. Overall, we provide the first detailed investigation of the interactions between population sparseness, learning speed, and storage capacity.

A wide range of physiological processes and behaviours are regulated by these neurotransmitters/hormones. Octopamine and tyramine act homologous to the adrenergic system of vertebrates, primarily adapting the organism to the given situation, by switching between the states of alertness and rest. Interestingly, higher brain functions like learning and memory are also regulated by octopamine and tyramine. About 30 years ago, initial work in Drosophila has demonstrated that dopaminergic neurons signal punishment, while octopaminergic neurons signal reward during olfactory associative learning and memory. In the meantime, however, it has become clear that distinct types of dopaminergic neurons convey both reward and punishment signals to the mushroom bodies, a central brain region responsible for the formation and storage of associative memories. Although some conflicting data remain, these findings challenge the previously established model of functional segregation and may limit the proposed role of octopamine neurons as teaching neurons during memory formation. We have therefore re-examined the role of octopamine in learning and memory in Drosophila larvae. Through a combination of Ca2+ imaging, anatomical studies and gain-of-function and loss-of-function behavioural approaches, we demonstrate that octopamine signalling plays a crucial role in larval learning by modulating dopaminergic neurons across distinct cell clusters to orchestrate memory processes.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

A prime example is asynchronous flight as used by ~600,000 insect species (Dudley, 2018), where wingbeat frequency and flight power output are controlled by a rate code of the flight power motoneurons (Hurkey et al., 2023). The five motoneurons that innervate the wing depressor muscle fibers translate different magnitudes of excitatory drive smoothly into changes of their common firing rates, which in turn, are linearly related to wing power output (Gordon and Dickinson, 2006). Such motoneuron input/output properties are called type-I excitability and are achieved by the expression of specific combinations of ion currents that linearize the frequency-input current curve. But are there additional motoneuron properties that compensate for acute perturbation of their rate code? Here we combine in vivo electrophysiology with Drosophila genetics to test for mechanisms that compensate for transient perturbation of rate coding during behavior. We show that MN intrinsic properties compensate for the occurrence of extra spikes by delaying the subsequent spikes, thus restoring rate coding fidelity. The underlying mechanism is dose and phase dependent. First, compensatory increases of subsequent interspike interval durations grow with the number of supernumerous spikes that interfere with coding. Second, the magnitude of the compensation for single extra spikes depends on when during an interspike interval these occur. This mechanism depends at least in part on axonally localized HCN channels and increases the fidelity of motoneuron rate coding in the light of perturbation during flight motor behavior.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

However, direct neurophysiological comparisons with other prefrontal regions are lacking, leaving the FPC's putative dominance untested. Contrary to this view, our comparison of neuronal activity across the full anteroposterior LPFC in macaques during six distinct tasks probing these functions revealed a posterior-to-mid LPFC dominance, with resource-allocation, novelty-detection (including reward-prediction error), and modality invariant decision-monitoring signals all showing a common posterior bias. In contrast, regardless of task demands, the FPC's strongest encoding was about the most recently executed action, and it displayed minimal object selectivity, even when objects were task-critical. We identified a turning point in this graded posterior-to-anterior transition from task-positive to task-negative regions around the border between the anterior and middle thirds of the LPFC. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that the LPFC is anterior-dominant across primate species, and provide evolutionary constraints on theories of human prefrontal organization.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

By adulthood, human cortex contains at least three regions that respond selectively to visual scene information, but it remains unknown when or how these regions develop. One hypothesis is that scene selectivity emerges gradually in regions that initially prefer certain low-level visual features (e.g., peripheral visual input, high spatial frequencies, rectilinearity), and then exposure to the visual statistics of natural scenes drives the emergence of scene selective responses. However, both aspects of this hypothesis remain to be tested: how early scene selectivity first arises in human development, and whether it is driven by passive exposure to visual statistics. We therefore collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data from awake 2-9-month-old infants while they watched videos of real-world scenes with ego-motion, as well as faces, objects, and scrambled videos. We found stronger responses to scenes than control conditions in the location of all three scene regions. Scene-selective responses could not be explained by low-level visual properties of the stimuli, and were found in infants as young as 2-5 months old, with no evidence of age-related change. We also measured infants experience independently navigating (e.g., crawling), which was not necessary for the development of scene-selectivity. In sum, cortical regions are scene-selective in human infants prior to independent navigation, and after only limited exposure to visual scene statistics.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Immunometabolism is critical for innate immunity and inflammation. However, how metabolic enzymes and metabolites contribute to inflammatory resolution remains largely unknown. To identify the key metabolic mediators of inflammation resolution, we generated an AAV9-Sleeping Beauty CRISPR library comprising 17090 sgRNAs targeting 2682 mouse metabolic genes. We then conducted an in vivo CRISPR screen in type alveolar epithelial cells (AECs)-specifically expressing Cas9 mice and uncovered a very long chain fatty acid elongase, ELOVL5, that promoted the resolution of lung inflammation after influenza virus infection. Deficiency of Elovl5 in mouse lung epithelial cells impaired lung inflammation resolution and tissue repair phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ELOVL5 bound to STING, inhibiting TBK1 interaction and translocation to the Golgi. These effects ultimately reduced STING-mediated inflammation and promoted AKT1-mediated tissue repair. In addition, ELOVL5 decreased eicosanoid levels in AECs to promote lung inflammation resolution. Supplement with ELOVL5 downstream products reversed the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines caused by Elovl5 deficiency. These results support an unrevealed mechanism for polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism in the resolution of innate inflammation and provide paths toward treating inflammatory diseases through manipulating cellular lipid metabolism.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

This study investigated the early immune responses in the draining lymph node (dLN) and its role in mediating antiviral protection following vaccination. Here, we focused on the involvement of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in adaptive immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is rapidly transported to the dLN and is primarily captured by leukocytes that initiate the expression of the viral antigenic spike protein. Notably, we demonstrated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are key orchestrators of the inflammatory and humoral response, as their specific depletion led to impaired antibody production and diminished neutralization capacity. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed an interaction between pDCs and CD8+ T cells that facilitates T cell activation. In vivo experiments confirmed that pDCs expressing the viral spike protein directly engage with CD8+ T cells, promoting their differentiation and expansion. Moreover, the absence of pDCs affected the formation of antigen-specific memory T cells. Overall, these findings highlight that pDCs are essential players in mediating both adaptive and humoral responses to the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, providing insights into the mechanistic functioning of mRNA vaccines and establishing a novel role for pDCs as professional APCs.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium that can invade mosquito populations and inhibit human pathogens. Historically Wolbachia was thought to not occur naturally within wild Anopheles populations, but recent evidence has confirmed the presence of at least two strains in genuine symbiosis. Detection of Wolbachia strains has pre-dominantly relied on PCR amplification of Wolbachia genes and/or sanger and illumina sequencing. In this study, we assess the use of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) for detecting bacteria within wild Anopheles mosquitoes and determine the ability to detect the endosymbiotc bacterium Wolbachia. We assessed Wolbachia detection from library preparations using the ONT Field sequencing kit for MinION sequencing on the Mk1C and found a pool size of 10 mosquitoes is required preventing individual mosquito analysis. There were approximately13 times more Wolbachia reads in pooled Anopheles demeilloni compared to Anopheles gambiae. Utilizing the more economical Flongle flow cells and Mk1B device, we further evaluated the effectiveness of two library preparation methods that are compatible: Rapid PCR Barcoding and 16S Barcoding kits. Our findings indicate that the 16S Barcoding Kit in conjunction with the Flongle flowcell effectively identified Wolbachia in both Anopheles demeilloni and Anopheles moucheti but we found no evidence of Wolbachia in Anopheles gambiae.

A combined approach was used: metagenomic analysis to profile microbial diversity, and culturable enrichment using PET-supplemented mineral medium followed by iso-lation and PEG-based clear zone screening. PET degradation was assessed over 21 days using PET film as the sole carbon source, and surface damage was evaluated via scan-ning electron microscopy (SEM). Metagenomic analysis revealed high microbial diver-sity dominated by Pseudomonadota and Bacillota, suggesting potential for PET degrada-tion. From 34 culturable isolates, six exhibited clear zone activity: BP8, CT9, CT11 (Bantar Gebang) and ET4, EP19, FP20 (Cipayung). SEM and relative enzyme activity assays confirmed PET film degradation, particularly in isolates BP8 and EP19. Molecular iden-tification via 16S rRNA sequencing revealed high similarity of BP8 to Priestia megaterium, CT9 to Comamonas terrae, CT11 and FP20 to Brucella pseudintermedia, ET4 to Shinella yambaruensis, and EP19 to Micrococcus luteus.

Current antibiotic treatments are expensive, prolonged, and toxic, and bacterial resistance has been reported. Host defense peptides, known for their bactericidal and immunomodulatory effects, and their ability to induce poor bacterial resistance due to their direct effect on the bacterial membrane, represent a novel therapeutic approach.

After this aggression reduction, the gradual increase in affiliative behaviors varied by type of affiliative behavior and ranged from one to seven days. We then measured neurobiological changes at three time points during this transition to uncover mechanisms that might govern this shift from aggressive to affiliative behavior, revealing novel sex differences that add to current research on biological mechanisms of social bonding. Specifically, we examined plasticity through mRNA expression of two perineuronal net (PNN) associated proteins, HAPLN and ACAN, in two brain regions implicated in affiliation, aggression, and social cognition: the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) and lateral septum (LS). The vACC in females exhibited higher expression levels of both of these PNN components relative to males. Additionally, we observed a decrease in ACAN mRNA expression in the vACC over the course of pair bond establishment, but no such change in the LS. Furthermore, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and vasopressin receptor (AVPR) plasticity exhibited sex-specific patterns in the vACC during pair bond formation. Females displayed higher OXTR mRNA expression across the bonding period, whereas males expressed higher AVPR mRNA levels. In addition, our results uncovered a positive association between AVPR expression levels in the vACC and male-female nesting distance, a novel measure of affiliative behavior. We discuss how a decrease in PNNs could allow for an increase in receptor plasticity in the vACC as the pair bond is established.

In this study, we employed size-exclusion chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and immunoblotting to identify and validate a high-molecular-weight Cu-containing peak in SEC-ICP-MS chromatogram as representative of CuCOX activity. We demonstrate that this CuCOX peak is enhanced under metabolic conditions favoring oxidative phosphorylation, such as high Cu supplementation or galactose-containing media, and correlates with increased mitochondrial respiration. By tracing exogenously supplied 63Cu, we characterized the time- and dose-dependent incorporation of newly acquired Cu into CuCOX. Functional RNA interference (RNAi) experiments targeting key Cu transporters revealed that CuCOX formation is independent of the high-affinity Cu importer CTR1, but instead relies on alternative transporters including DMT1, LAT1, and the mitochondrial carrier SLC25A3. These findings offer new insight into the cellular pathways governing Cu trafficking and allocation to mitochondria under physiologically relevant conditions. Furthermore, our work establishes SEC-ICP-MS as a sensitive and specific method for quantifying CuCOX and assessing mitochondrial metabolism. This platform holds promise for the identification of Cu-related biomarkers and therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of diseases such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where dysregulated Cu homeostasis plays a critical role.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Like other redox enzymes, LPMOs face challenges in handling the reactive oxygen species generated at their active site, which must be controlled to prevent off-pathway reactions that lead to enzyme inactivation. In the case of LPMOs, oxidative damage may be self-reinforcing because free copper released from damaged catalytic centers will promote abiotic redox reactions that generate reactive oxygen species. Here we show that some members of a widely spread family of carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM2s) have evolved the ability to bind copper and that this ability is exclusively found in CBM2s that are appended to LPMOs. We show that the copper site in these CBM2s protects the LPMO from inactivation both by scavenging free copper, preferably Cu(I), and by interacting directly with the reduced catalytic copper site of the LPMO, thus preventing the enzyme from engaging in off-pathway reactions. These effects are demonstrated by studies on the redox stability of a series of engineered LPMO variants as well as AlphaFold3 models of the CBM2-containing enzymes. Interestingly, the copper site and the cellulose-binding surface are located on different sides of these CBM2s, enabling a mode of action in which the CBM inhibits potentially damaging LPMO activity in the absence of substrate, while such inhibition would be relieved upon binding of the CBM2 to cellulose. These findings show that CBMs have biologically relevant functions beyond carbohydrate-binding and reveal a mechanism for substrate-dependent regulation of LPMO reactivity.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

It has contributed greatly to our understanding of the relaxed, 430-[A]-repeating organization of myosin heads in thick filaments in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Using X-ray diffraction, changes in filament structure can be detected on the [A] length scale and millisecond time scale, leading to models that are the foundation of our understanding of the structural basis of contraction. As with all X-ray fiber diffraction studies, interpretation requires modeling, which has previously been based on low-resolution knowledge of thick filament structure and is complicated by the contributions of multiple filament components to most X-ray reflections. Here, we use an atomic model of the human cardiac thick filament C-zone, derived from cryo-EM, to compute objectively the contributions of myosin heads, tails, titin, and cMyBP-C to the diffraction pattern, by including/excluding these components in the calculations. Our results support some previous interpretations but contradict others. We confirm that the myosin heads are responsible for most of the intensity on the myosin layer-lines, including the M3 meridional. Contrary to expectation, we find that myosin tails contribute little to the pattern, including the M6 meridional; this reflection arises mainly from heads and other components. The M11 layer line (39 [A] spacing) arises mostly from the curved and kinked structure of titin, which allows eleven ~42-[A]-long domains to fit into the 430 [A] repeat. The M11 spacing can be used as a measure of strain in the myosin filament backbone as there is negligible head contribution. These insights should aid future understanding of the X-ray pattern of intact muscle in different conditions such as contraction and drug treatment.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, particularly at microscopic level in real time. Recently developed short-pulse ultrasound enhances safety by reducing side effects compared to conventional long-pulse ultrasound. Using vessel-mimicking microchannels cultured with brain endothelial monolayers, we directly observed bubble dynamics and cellular bioeffects under flow conditions. Intriguingly, cyclic jetting during stable cavitation occurs at long-pulse mode, accompanied by a few localized cell detachments and extensive sonoporation. In contrast, short-pulse ultrasound induced milder, uniform bubble dynamics, reversible sonoporation and calcium signaling, promoting safer BBB modulation. In vivo two-photon imaging and histology in mice confirmed these findings, showing that long-pulse ultrasound enabled higher drug delivery efficiency but caused localized endothelial damage, while short-pulse ultrasound facilitated uniform delivery and faster BBB recovery. The differential bubble dynamics and cellular responses correlated well between in vitro and in vivo models.

To address this gap, we investigated flowering time variation across a broad geographical and bioclimatic range in Fragaria vesca (woodland strawberry), a perennial herb from the Rosaceae family. We found that the timing of floral transition and subsequent flowering in F. vesca populations is primarily shaped by population structure, reflecting postglacial colonization patterns from distinct refugia, and is further modulated by adaptations to winter temperatures. The association of increasing expression of FvFT1, the strawberry ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T, with delayed flowering in accessions from diverse climatic and genetic backgrounds suggested FvFT1 as a major candidate gene regulating flowering time variation. We further demonstrated how distinct florigen and antiflorigen roles of FvFT1 are dependent on functional alleles of F. vesca TERMINAL FLOWER1 (FvTFL1) and how the epistatic relationship between FvFT1 and FvTFL1 controls adaptive flowering time variation by adjusting sensitivity to floral inductive photoperiod and vernalization.

Many bacteriophages synthesize complex modifications (i.e., hypermodifications) to the nucleobases of their virion DNA in order to circumvent the endonuclease-based defenses of their hosts. To date, most hypermodified pyrimidines in viruses are synthesized via group transfer to a pre-existing hydroxyl moiety in DNA during the later stages of lytic development leading up to packaging of the viral chromosome into the capsid. Typically, these occur at hydroxymethylcytosine or hydroxymethyluracil. We find mono- and poly-arabinosylated cytidines completely replacing canonical cytidine in the native DNA of the Escherichia phage RB69 and Acinetobacter baumannii phage DLP3. In both cases, an arabinosyl moiety is connected directly to the pyrimidine through an ether linkage with the bridging oxygen originating from 5-hydroxycytosine (5hoC) in DNA. The 5hoC is synthesized as a mononucleotide by a virally encoded thymidylate synthase homolog. We find diverse virally encoded thymidylate synthase homologs, including the Rhizobium phage RL38J1, are capable of producing 5hoC suggesting this base modification is a starting point for glycodiverse cytosine derivatives.

K.; Cote, C.; Karia, A.; Harton, S.; Perreault, C.", "abstract": "The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) is crucial in adaptive immunity, enabling CD8+ T cells to detect and eliminate infected and cancerous cells. Recent studies have uncovered significant variability in MHC I expression across tissues, challenging the traditional belief of uniform expression. Lung epithelial cells (LECs) express meager amounts of MHC I, which preserves the lung epithelium from excessive inflammation but renders it more susceptible to cancer and infection. Despite MHC I overexpression in various immunopathologies, its precise role in disease initiation or progression remains unclear due to the absence of suitable in vivo models for studying MHC I overexpression. This study introduces a novel mouse model with targeted surface MHC I upregulation. Leveraging a conditional Cre-lox system, we augmented Nlrc5 expression to specifically upregulate MHC I in alveolar type 2 (AT2) LECs, known for their low basal expression of MHC I and significant overexpression in disease. Our model demonstrated a rapid and sustained tenfold increase in MHC I surface expression persisting for up to a year without triggering pathology or inflammation. Comprehensive characterization and validation of this model indicated that MHC I overexpression does not serve as a primary initiator of respiratory diseases under steady-state conditions and shows a therapeutic window for increasing MHC I without significant damage to the lung epithelium. This adaptable model offers insights into the effects of tissue-specific MHC I regulation and presents new avenues for therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Despite intensive study for decades, functional redundancies in the system obscure the contributions of the collectively important individual genes. Here, we leverage transposon sequencing across bacteria strains lacking key chaperones and proteases to reveal hidden determinants of stress response in protein homeostasis. By profiling fitness under multiple proteotoxic stresses, we uncover stress-specific vulnerabilities and reveal how major players of PQC mask correlations between transcriptomic responses and gene fitness. As an illustration of unexpected connections, we identify a heat-specific synthetic lethality between the disaggregase ClpB and DNA Polymerase I (PolA) mediated by persistent aggregation of the RecA recombinase and toxic persistence of the heat shock regulon. Our findings reveal that stress-induced aggregation is not broadly toxic. Rather, it becomes lethal in specific genetic or environmental contexts due to the depletion of components only needed in those specific circumstances. This work presents a framework to reveal normally hidden fragility in stress responses using gene fitness scores adaptable to a variety of systems.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

I.", "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has become an important and routine method in C. elegans research to generate new mutants and endogenously tag genes. One complication of CRISPR experiments is that the efficiency of single-guide RNA sequences can vary dramatically. One solution to this problem is to create an intermediate entry strain using the efficient and well-characterised dpy-10 guide RNA sequence. This 'd10 entry strain' can then be used to generate your knock-in of interest. However, the dpy-10 sequence is not always suitable when creating an entry strain. For example, if your gene of interest is closely linked to dpy-10 on LGII or if you want to use the dpy-10 as a co-CRISPR marker for the creation of the entry strain then you can not use the dpy-10 sequence. This publication reports a synthetic guide sequence, GCTATCAACTATCCATATCG, that is not present in the C. elegans genome and can be used to create entry strains. This guide sequence is demonstrated to be relatively robust with a knock-in efficiency that varies from 1-11%. While this is lower than the efficiency observed with d10 entry strains, it is still sufficient for most applications. This guide sequence can be added to the C. elegans CRISPR toolkit and is particularly useful for generating entry strains where the standard dpy-10 guide sequence is not suitable.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

In response to the growing need for developing more accurate and cost-effective biomass estimation methods, the analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) has recently emerged as an alternative for fish abundance quantification. However, practical approaches for integrating eDNA data into fisheries assessment remain limited. Here, we introduce a Bayesian joint model that combines acoustic-trawl and eDNA data to estimate fish biomass. Utilizing 209 water eDNA samples and 196 acoustic transects, the model was applied to estimate the distribution and abundance of the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay. The joint model produced estimates consistent with known spatial patterns of anchovy, with eDNA data suggesting a broader distribution and potentially higher abundance. This research demonstrates the value of incorporating eDNA data as a complement to acoustic-trawl for stock assessment and illustrates the versatility of joint Bayesian models and their potential application to various species and datasets. Ultimately, our work opens new avenues for more holistic fisheries assessment, underscoring the growing role of eDNA in that context", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

By considering chromatin as a biomolecular condensate we demonstrate that the adsorption of the chromatin-binding proteins at the lamina leads to a wetting of the condensate while spreading of the chromatin on the lamina is avoided. This leads to the non-monotonous density profile of the polymer with respect to the surface which can be explained by the competition between the tendency of the protein component to wet the surface and the conformational restrictions of the polymer near the impenetrable surface. A change in the composition of the lamina can lead to repositioning of chromatin towards the center of the nucleus. We explore various mechanisms by which lamina compositional shifts could lead to the dewetting of the condensate. Our theory not only offers an explanation for specific chromatin conformation experiments, but also contributes to the broader understanding of wetting onto responsive surfaces in multi-component systems.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Z.", "abstract": "Betalains are water-soluble pigments with two major classes: red-violet betacyanins and yellow-orange betaxanthins. These pigments are increasingly being sought after as natural replacements for synthetic pigments in the food industry. Traditionally, betalains are extracted from cultivated plants but, due to low native pigments, the process is inherently inefficient. Now, as consumer demand increases, scalable and sustainable production routes are needed. To address this challenge, we engineered a heterologous pathway for the production of betaxanthins into cyanobacteria. The pathway consists of the cytochrome P450 CYP76AD1 and the L-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase DODA1 from Beta vulgaris (beet). Introduction of the two-enzyme betaxanthin pathway in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 did not result in detectable betaxanthins. Subsequent metabolic adjustments to the shikimate pathway, using a feedback resistant AroGfbr from E. coli, led to an overaccumulation of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, and the production of 0.11 mg L-1 phenylalanine-betaxanthin. Optimization of the cultivation conditions (i.e., growth in nutrient-rich medium and CO-1-enriched air) increased titers almost 150 times and led to the production of phenylalanine-betaxanthin with a final titer of 15.3 mg L-1. Our work establishes a microbial system for photoautotrophic betaxanthin pigment production without the need for exogenous amino acid supplementation.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

This learning deficit may be related to the ability to extract probabilistic properties of events in the environment, which is based on the functions of cortical and subcortical brain regions underlying SL. Using a behavioral SL task and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested SL ability in the visual domain and its neural correlates in children with DLD and their typically developing (TD) peers. During fMRI, children performed SL tasks involving sequences of two types of stimuli: easy-to-name (EN) objects and difficult-to-name (DN) objects. The children underwent a pre-training fMRI, one week of behavioural training and a post-training fMRI. Similar task performance was observed in both groups during the experimental sessions, with an improvement in performance following training in the SL tasks involving both EN and DN objects. FMRI results revealed that, after training, the DLD group presented greater involvement of the frontal cortex and temporal pole for EN objects. Furthermore, in the TD group, the left putamen, globus pallidus (GP) and thalamus were involved in the early stages of SL, whereas in the DLD group, these areas were involved in SL after training. For DN objects, after training, the DLD group presented greater involvement of the parietal and precuneus regions in the SL task performance. Our results suggest that children with DLD may employ different cognitive processes in SL than TD children, possibly as a compensatory mechanism.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

A comparative multi-omics study was conducted on JEV-infected macrophages, the early site of JEV replication in both species. We identified 24 key determinants potentially regulating viral growth. Functional validation of three antiviral factors - LGALS1, ssc-miR-133a-3p, and hsa-miR-3614-5p, and two proviral factors - MIF and VMP1, in macrophages showed that the upregulation of MIF and VMP1, and downregulation of ssc-miR-133a-3p, enhanced JEV replication in pigs. In contrast, the downregulation of MIF and VMP1 and upregulation of hsa-miR-3614-5p reduced JEV replication in human macrophages.

Genomic prediction - that is, predicting individual genetic values from high-density marker data - has revolutionized breeding programs and medical genetics. In wild populations, however, genomic prediction has been used in only a handful of studies, and only within populations. There is still a lack of applications that predict across wild populations, which could provide answers to questions related to spatially varying evolutionary processes, such as local adaptation. A severe challenge for across-population genomic prediction, however, is the decrease in accuracy when models are trained on data from one population and predict genetic values in another. Here, we used genomic prediction to predict across wild house sparrow populations, and compared the accuracy to within-population prediction. Predictions across populations were less accurate and more variable than within populations. We also highlighted limitations of the current theory for general genomic prediction accuracy, and related across-population accuracy to several population differentiation measures. Our results underline the necessity of understanding why genomic prediction currently performs poorly across populations, and of developing methods that exploit genomic data in novel ways.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}

Despite their broad immunosuppressive utility, sustained use of GCs is often intolerable due to the prevalence of adverse side effects. A longstanding goal has been to make synthetic GCs safer by developing selective GR ligands that have similar anti-inflammatory activity but without the burden of side effects. To evaluate the ability of synthetic GCs to target specific subsets of the GC response, we completed a genome-wide comparative analysis of changes in gene expression and gene regulatory element activity in response to ten ligands with various evidence of dissociated adverse side effects. We measured the gene expression response using mRNA-seq and the gene regulatory element response using genome-wide STARR-seq. Effects associated with each ligand were highly correlated with and linearly related to the response to dexamethasone, a strong, non-selective GR agonist used as a positive control for this study. Furthermore, 93% of the variation in regulatory element activity responses could be explained by the efficacy of each ligand alone. We also found limited evidence of differential enrichment of chromatin context-specific markers of regulatory activity with each ligand. Based on those findings, we developed a simulation framework to evaluate selectivity of GR ligands. We conclude that the ligands we tested elicit attenuated molecular responses according to their respective efficacies, and do not selectively target subsets of the molecular GC response.", "date": "2025-06-16", "journal": ""}
