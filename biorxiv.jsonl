C.", "abstract": "Humans and animals can flexibly choose their actions based on different information, ranging from objective states of the environment (e.g., apples are bigger than cherries) to subjective preferences (e.g., cherries are tastier than apples). Whether the brain instantiates these different choices by recruiting either specialised or shared neural circuitry remains debated. Specifically, domain-general accounts of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function propose that prefrontal areas flexibly process either perceptual or value-based evidence depending on what is required for the present choice, whereas domain-specific theories posit that PFC sub-areas, such as the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), selectively integrate evidence relevant for perceptual decisions. Here we comprehensively test the functional role of the left SFS for choices based on perceptual and value-based evidence, by combining fMRI with a behavioural paradigm, computational modelling, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Confirming predictions by a sequential sampling model, we show that TMS-induced excitability reduction of the left SFS selectively changes the processing of decision-relevant perceptual information and associated neural processes. In contrast, value-based decision making and associated neural processes remain unaffected. This specificity of SFS function is evident at all levels of analysis (behavioural, computational, and neural, including functional connectivity), demonstrating that the left SFS causally contributes to evidence integration for perceptual but not value-based decisions.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

F.; Corona, F.", "abstract": "This paper concerns the inverse problem of characterising the state of a bioreactor from observations. In laboratory settings, the bioreactor is represented by a device called a chemostat. We consider a differential description of the evolution of the state of the chemostat under environmental fluctuations. First, we model the state evolution as a stochastic process driven by Brownian motion. Under this model, our best knowledge about the state of the chemostat is described by its probability distribution in time, given the distribution of the initial state. The corresponding probability density function solves a deterministic partial differential equation (PDE), the Kolmogorov forward equation. While this provides a probabilistic description, incorporating an observation process allows for a more refined characterisation of the state. More formally, we are interested in obtaining the distribution of the state conditional on an observation process as the solution to a filtering problem, with the corresponding conditional probability density function solving a non-linear stochastic PDE, the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. This paper focuses on the pathwise formulation of this filtering problem in which inferences about the state are obtained conditional on a fixed stream of observations. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the governing differential equations, ensuring well-posedness before presenting numerical approximations. We approximate the pathwise solution to the filtering problem by combining the finite difference and splitting methods for solving PDEs, and then compare the approximated solution with results from a linearisation method and a classical sequential Monte Carlo method.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

However, how individual ridges deform under contact to support accurate and high-precision tactile feedback is currently unknown. The complex mechanical structure of the glabrous skin, composed of multiple layers and intricate morphology within which mechanoreceptors are embedded, makes this question challenging. Here, we used optical coherence tomography to image and track sub-surface deformations of hundreds of individual fingerprint ridges across ten participants and four individual contact events at high spatial resolution in vivo. We calculated strain patterns in both the stratum corneum and viable epidermis in response to a variety of passively-applied tactile stimuli, including static indentation, stick-to-slip events, sliding of a flat surface in different directions, and interaction with small tactile features, such as edges and grooves. We found that ridges could stretch, compress, and undergo considerable shearing orthogonal to the skin surface, but there was limited horizontal shear. Therefore, it appears that the primary components of ridge deformation and, potentially, neural responses are deformations of the ridge flanks and their relative movement, rather than overall bending of the ridges themselves. We conclude that the local distribution of mechanoreceptors across the ridges might be ideally suited to extract the resulting strain gradients and that the fingertip skin may possess a higher mechanical spatial resolution than that of a single ridge.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Using single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized these different immune cell subpopulations, including cell types that have not been -or have only been partially- characterized in zebrafish so far. By histology, we found that, despite microglia being the main immune cell type in the parenchyma, the zebrafish brain is also populated by a distinct myeloid population that shares a gene signature with mammalian dendritic cells (DC). Notably, zebrafish DC-like cells rely on batf3, a gene essential for the development of conventional DC1 in the mouse. Using specific fluorescent reporter lines that allowed us to reliably discriminate DC-like cells from microglia, we quantified brain myeloid cell defects in commonly used irf8-/-, csf1ra-/- and csf1rb-/- mutant fish, revealing previously unappreciated distinct microglia and DC-like phenotypes.

Through metabolic RNA sequencing and phosphoproteomic profiling, we elucidate BDNF signalling and its role in axonal regeneration. We discover that BDNF controls RNA stability and transcriptional programs that converge with regeneration-associated gene (RAG) sets. We further unveil that BDNF governs the phosphorylation of multiple proteins essential for cytoskeletal dynamics, a major determinant of effective nerve regeneration. Using compartmentalized neuronal cultures, we demonstrate that the regeneration driven by BDNF depends on the axon-specific activation of ERK/RSK/S6K kinase pathway.

Here, we aimed to confirm and elucidate these changes. Interestingly, we did not detect an increase in total mast cell numbers in weight cycled mice by Toluidine blue or flow cytometry, however, further subcluster analysis of our dataset showed that our initial mast cell cluster consisted of two unique populations. One population had very high expression of classical mast cell markers and another had elevated lipid handling and antigen presentation genes with a concomitant reduction in classical mast cell genes. This new lipid-associated mast cell cluster accounted for most of the mast cells in the weight cycled group. We induced a similar phenotype in vitro using repeated exposure to adipose tissue conditioned media to mimic weight gain and weight regain. Upon repeated exposure to adipose tissue conditioned media, bone marrow-derived mast cells had increased lipid droplets and reduced expression of cKit and FcER1 compared to control cells. Moreover, we analyzed mast cells in a pilot study of subcutaneous adipose tissue from four obese, prediabetic women. We found two mast cell populations that appear similar to the murine populations detected by sequencing. The population with reduced cKit and FcER1 was significantly correlated with weight variance. Together, these data suggest that weight cycling may induce a unique population of mast cells similar to lipid- associated macrophages, which have been shown to play a role in diverse diseases from obesity and atherosclerosis to Alzheimers disease. Future studies will focus on isolation of these cells from mice and humans to better determine their lineage, differentiation, and functional roles.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

This revealed CPE-mediated mRNA polyadenylation as a prominent target of Mos-MAPK, and we show that translation is required to drive the second meiotic division. Secondly, we identify a well-defined subset of cytoskeletal regulators as targets of Mos-MAPK. We show that this regulation is critical to ensure the asymmetry of meiotic divisions primarily by reducing the growth of astral microtubules. This allows positioning of the spindle directly beneath the cortex and prevents the separation of spindle poles in anaphase, thereby minimizing polar body size. Thus, by phosphoproteomics we reveal molecular modules controlled by Mos-MAPK explaining how this single, conserved kinase can act as a switch between the mitotic and meiotic division programs.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Despite the widespread observation of SAT in experiments, there is no theoretical framework to predict the critical number of cell cycles, n*, that marks the beginning of asynchronous division. Here, by probabilistically modeling cell cycle progression under the assumption that the distribution of cell division times is broadened, we predict n* and the time at which the SAT occurs. The theory, supplemented by agent-based simulations, supports the hypothesis that the SAT emerges as a consequence of biomechanical feedback on cell division. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments while also explaining the cell cycle lengthening that arises as a result of biomechanical feedback. The emergence of the asynchronous phase is due to increasing fluctuations in the cell cycle times with each round of cell division. We also make several testable predictions that further sheds light on the role of biomechanical feedback in growing multicellular systems, such as during tissue and tumor growth.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

A major challenge in tissue engineering is identifying material properties that mimic dynamic tissue boundaries but that are compatible with the engineering tools necessary for controlling the initial conditions of culture. Here we describe a highly tunable granular biomaterial, MAGIC matrix, that supports long-term bioprinting and gold-standard tissue self-organization. MAGIC matrix is designed for two temperature regimes: at 4 {degrees}C it exhibits reversible yield-stress behavior to support hours-long high-fidelity 3D printing without compromising cell viability; when transferred to cell culture at 37 {degrees}C, the material cross-links and exhibits viscoelasticity and stress relaxation that can be tuned to match numerous conditions, including that of reconstituted basement membrane matrices like Matrigel. We demonstrate that the timescale of stress relaxation and loss tangent are decoupled in MAGIC matrices, allowing us to test the role of stress relaxation rate and strain-dependence across formulations with identical storage and loss moduli. We find that fast absolute stress relaxation rates and large relative deformation magnitudes are required to optimize for morphogenesis. We apply optimized MAGIC matrices toward precise extrusion bioprinting of saturated cell suspensions directly into 3D culture. The ability to carefully control initial conditions for tissue growth yields dramatic increases in organoid reproducibility and complexity across multiple tissue types. We also fabricate perfusable 3D microphysiological systems that experience large strains in response to pressurization due to the compliant and dynamic tissue boundaries. Combined, our results both identify key parameters for optimal organoid morphogenesis in an engineered material and lay the foundation for fabricating more complex and reproducible tissue morphologies by canalizing their self-organization in both space and time.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Recent studies of hippocampal engram cells, or neurons identified by learning-induced immediate early gene (IEG) expression, propose that these populations form the cellular substrate for memory. Previous experimental work suggests that cells are recruited into engrams via elevated intrinsic excitability and that learning drives coactivity among these cells to support retrieval. Despite this, an understanding of how engram dynamics evolve across learning and recall remains incomplete. Here, we combined activity-dependent genetic tagging with longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to track CA1 engram population dynamics before and after fear conditioning. Our results reveal that engram activity is modulated by intrinsic dynamics, behavioral state, and stimulus-cued reactivation. First, spontaneous activity during quiet rest, up to two days before Fos expression, predicted future engram membership, consistent with the idea that intrinsic dynamics bias engram allocation. In parallel, we found sequential activity during locomotion recruited both engram and non-engram cells, but that engram cells were less modulated by velocity after contextual fear conditioning. Surprisingly, after fear conditioning, we did not find changes in the average spontaneous activity rates or correlations of CA1 engram cells. However, within the engram population, we identified a subset of cells that increased their spontaneous correlations after fear learning, specifically during quiet rest. Furthermore, we used a trace fear conditioning paradigm to show that CS presentation drove elevated activity and increased correlations amongst engram cells, demonstrating learning-dependent reactivation. Finally, computational modeling of CA3-CA1 circuit dynamics demonstrated that a network with strong excitatory-inhibitory balance, capable of CA3-driven reactivation, is consistent with our experimental results.

CMT results in the emergence of antigen-negative tumor cells, which can evade future CAR detection, and antigen-positive CAR T cells, which has been suggested to cause CAR T cell fratricide and exhaustion. Whether CMT indeed causes CAR T cell dysfunction and the molecular mechanisms conferring CMT remain unknown. Using a selective degrader of trogocytosed antigen in CAR T cells, we show that the presence of trogocytosed antigen on the CAR T cell surface directly causes CAR T cell fratricide and exhaustion. By performing a small molecule screening using a custom high throughput CMT-screening assay, we found that the cysteine protease cathepsin B is essential for CMT and that inhibition of cathepsin B is sufficient to prevent CAR T cell fratricide and exhaustion, leading to improved long-term CAR T cell persistence and anti-tumor activity. Our data demonstrate that it is feasible to separate CMT from cytotoxic activity, that CAR T cell persistence, a key factor associated with clinical CAR T cell efficacy, is directly linked to cathepsin B activity in CAR T cells, and that it is possible to improve CAR T cell function through selective inhibition of CMT.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

The raters were asked to assess the quality of images following 8 specific criteria like blurring or tissue contrast, providing a multi-dimensional view on image quality. We show that, using a protocol and training sessions, artifacts like bias field and blur level still have a low agreement (ICC below 0.5), while global quality scores show very high agreement (ICC = 0.9) across raters. We also observe that the SRR methods are influenced differently by factors like gestational age, input data quality and number of stacks used by reconstruction.

Despite the presence of confounding factors, such as obesity, studies have shown that after adjusting for age, body mass index, and genetics (e.g. twins), patients with T2D suffer from disproportionately more IVD degeneration and/or back pain. We hypothesize that chronic T2D fosters a proinflammatory microenvironment within the IVD that promotes degeneration and disrupts IVD homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated two commonly used mouse models of T2D-the leptin-receptor deficient mouse (db/db) and the chronic high-fat diet in mice with impaired beta-cell function (STZ-HFD). Compared to their genetic controls-C57BL/6 wild-type mice for STZ-HFD and heterozygous littermates for db/db-STZ-HFD IVDs exhibited more severe degeneration and elevated chemokine expression profiles. RNA-seq further revealed extensive transcriptional dysregulation in STZ-HFD IVDs that was not observed in the db/db model. The STZ-HFD IVDs also expressed enzymes that enhanced production of glycolytic AGE precursors, impaired non-AGE DAMP pathways, and reduced suppressors of RAGE turnover. These results suggest that, under controlled genetic and environmental conditions, the STZ-HFD model more accurately reflect the multifactorial inflammatory milieu characteristic of T2D-induced IVD degeneration.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

It recruits CRL4CRBN to ENL through an extended interface of protein-protein and protein-ligand contacts, but only after pre-forming the ENL:dHTC1 complex. We also characterized two structurally distinct BRD4 degraders, including dHTC3, a molecular glue that selectively dimerizes the first bromodomain of BRD4 to SCFFBXO3, an E3 ligase not previously accessible for chemical rewiring. Altogether, this study introduces HTC as a facile tool to discover new CIPs and actionable cellular effectors of proximity pharmacology.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Nearly two fifths of enzymes exhibit cell-to-cell variable expression, and half localize to multiple cellular compartments. Metabolic heterogeneity arises largely autonomously of cell cycling, and individual cells reestablish these myriad metabolic phenotypes over several cell divisions.

While cortical mechanisms of conscious perception have been extensively investigated in humans, the role of subcortical structures, including the thalamus, remains less explored. Here, we elucidate the causal contributions of different thalamic regions to conscious perception using transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) neuromodulation. We hypothesize that modulating distinct thalamic regions alters perceptual outcomes derived from Signal Detection Theory. We apply LIFU to healthy human anterior (transmodal-dominant) and posterior (unimodal-dominant) thalamic regions, further subdivided into ventral and dorsal regions, during a near-threshold visual perception task. We show that high duty cycle modulation of the ventral anterior (VA) part of thalamus enhances object recognition sensitivity. Sensitivity enhancement magnitude correlates with the core-matrix cell compositions of the stimulated thalamic region. Connectivity analysis of a large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset confirms strong transmodal connectivity of VA thalamus with frontoparietal and default-mode networks. We also demonstrate target-invariant effects of high duty cycle LIFU disrupting object categorization accuracy. These findings provide causal insight into the cytoarchitectural and functional organization of the thalamus that shapes human visual experience, especially the role of matrix cell-rich, transmodal-dominant VA thalamus.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Immune activation is a hallmark of both diseases, but current model systems primarily examine each pathology in isolation. As such, how these co-pathologies interact to drive inflammation and neuronal loss remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed a co-pathology mouse model combining tau, amyloid-{beta}, and -synuclein. Here, we show that co-pathologies synergistically trigger a distinct and amplified neuroimmune response, marked by robust expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells and increased CD68+ microglia, a population of activated, phagocytosing microglia, compared to single pathology brains. These changes were abundant in the hippocampus and cortex, regions showing elevated amyloid-{beta} protein pathology load and enhanced neuronal loss with co-pathology expression.

To identify genetic determinants of antibiotic tolerance in mycobacteria, we carried out transposon mutagenesis insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) screens in Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs) exposed to bactericidal translation-inhibiting antibiotics. This analysis identified genes essential for the survival of both spontaneous persister cells as well as for stress-induced tolerance, allowing the first genetic comparison of these states in mycobacteria. Pathway analysis identified multiple genes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including the catalase-peroxidase katG, which contributed to survival in both stressed and un-stressed populations. In addition, we found that endogenous ROS were generated following antibiotic exposure, and that hypoxia significantly impaired bacterial killing. Thus, in Mabs, the lethality of some antibiotics is amplified by toxic ROS accumulation, and antibiotic-tolerant cells require detoxification systems to remain viable.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated how different protein-rich foods (i.e., meat vs. dairy) affect fecal metagenomics and metabolomics during early complementary feeding from 5-12 months in U.S. formula-fed infants from a randomized controlled feeding trial. Results: We used a novel network representation learning approach to model the time-dependent, complex interactions between microbiome features, metabolite compounds, and diet. We then used the embedded space to detect features associated with age and diet type and found the meat diet group was enriched with microbial genes encoding amino acid, nucleic acid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Compared to a more traditional differential abundance analysis, which analyzes features independently and found no significant diet associations, network node embedding represents the infant samples, microbiome features, and metabolites in a single transformed space revealing otherwise undetected associations between infant diet and the gut microbiome. Conclusions: Our findings generate new hypotheses regarding the interplay between complementary feeding practices, microbial-metabolic interactions, and infant physiological outcomes. This work highlights the impact of complementary foods on infant gut microbiome development and the potential of using network representation learning to integrate multi-omic data, allowing for greater insight into complex diet, microbial, and metabolite interactions.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that with only 4x long-read coverage augmenting 30x short reads, we can improve SNP discovery across the genome and achieve precision and recall beyond what is possible with short reads, even at very high coverage (60x). For genotype-agnostic discovery of structural variants, we see a threefold improvement in recall while maintaining precision by using the low-coverage long reads on their own. For the more specialized scenario of genotype-aware structural variant calling, we show how combining the long and short reads in a graph-based approach results in greater performance than either technology on its own. In addition, we demonstrate how the long reads can better phase these variants together, incorporating long-context information in the genome to substantially outperform phasing with short reads alone. The observed gains highlight the complementary nature of short and long read technologies: long reads help with SNP discovery by better mapping to difficult regions, and they provide better performance with large insertions and deletions (structural variants) by virtue of their length, while the larger number of short-read layers help with genotyping structural variants discovered by long reads. In this way, blend-seq offers many of the benefits of long-read pipelines without incurring the cost of high-coverage long reads.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Despite detailed structural knowledge on the arrestin interactions with phosphorylated tails of GPCRs, the interplay between receptor phosphorylation and arrestin coupling to the CME machinery is not well understood, in particular due to the weakness and dynamics of the individual molecular interactions. Here we have characterized the interactions of arrestin2, which is activated by the phosphorylated C-terminus of the human chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), with the main protein constituents of CME, namely clathrin and AP2 by solution NMR spectroscopy, biochemical and cellular assays. The NMR analysis revealed that arrestin2 interacts weakly with clathrin through a single binding site, independent of arrestin2 activation. In contrast, the arrestin2-AP2 interaction is stronger, requires arrestin2 activation by the CCR5 phospho-tail, and depends quantitatively on its degree of phosphorylation. These in vitro results are corroborated by cellular assays, which show that the chemokine-induced formation of a long-lived CCR5- arrestin2 internalization complex depends strongly on the interaction of arrestin2 with AP2, but not with clathrin.

A common objective in spatial transcriptomics data analysis is to identify spatially variable genes within predefined cell types or regions within the tissue. However, these regions are often implicitly one-dimensional, making standard two-dimensional coordinate-based methods less effective as they overlook the underlying tissue organization. Here we introduce a methodology grounded in spectral graph theory to elucidate a one-dimensional curve that effectively approximates the spatial coordinates of the examined sample. This curve is then used to establish a new coordinate system that reflects tissue morphology. We then develop a generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate spatial patterns which permits the detection of genes with variable expression in the new morphologically relevant coordinate system. Our approach directly models gene counts, thereby eliminating the need for normalization or transformations to satisfy normality assumptions. A second important advantage over existing hypothesis-testing approaches is that our method not only improves performance but also accurately estimates gene expression patterns and precisely pinpoints spatial loci where deviations from constant expression occur. We validate our approach through extensive simulation and by analyzing experimental data from multiple platforms such as Slide-seq and MERFISH. As an example of its ability to enable biological discovery, we demonstrate how our methodology enables the identification of novel interferon-related subpopulations in the mouse mucosa, as well as markers of inflammation-associated fibroblasts in a multi-sample spatial transcriptomic dataset.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

These plants acquire water and nutrients from their hosts through a specialized organ called the haustorium. A key step in haustorium development involves cell wall modification. In this study, we identified and analyzed the evolutionary relationships of pectate lyase-like (PLL) genes across parasitic plants and other non-parasitic land plant lineages. To support detailed examination of gene models and paralogous gene family members, we used published parasitic plant genomes, as well as a recently generated draft genome assembly and annotation of Triphysaria versicolor. One particular PLL gene, denoted as PLL1 in parasitic Orobanchaceae, emerged as an important candidate gene for parasitism. Our previous comparative transcriptomic analyses showed that PLL1 underwent neofunctionalization via an expression shift from floral tissues in non-parasitic relatives to haustoria in parasitic species. It belongs to the largest sub-clade of the PLL gene family, is highly upregulated in haustoria, and shows signatures of relaxed purifying selection and 15 individual sites with signatures of adaptive evolution. To explore its function in haustorium development, we manipulated PLL1 expression in T. versicolor, a model parasitic species from Orobanchaceae, using direct transformation with the parasite and host-induced-gene-silencing (HIGS). For HIGS, we generated transgenic Medicago hosts expressing hairpin RNAs targeting the PLL1 gene in T. versicolor. An average 60% reduction of PLL1 transcript level was observed in both direct transformation and HIGS treatments, leading to an increased frequency of poorly adhered parasites with fewer xylem connections and a smaller proportion of mature haustoria. These findings demonstrate that PLL1 plays a crucial role in haustorium development and suggest it as a promising target for managing parasitic weeds. Notably, the success of HIGS even before the establishment of a functional haustorium highlights the possibility of early intervention against parasitism.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

In family-living species, these microbes are often acquired through vertical transmission from parents and horizontal transmission from siblings.

Here, we tested the independent and interactive effects of social environment and cadmium ingestion - a highly toxic and common heavy metal pollutant - on the microbiome of juvenile European earwigs. We reared 900 juveniles either alone, with siblings or with siblings plus the mother. We exposed them to cadmium-enriched food at 0, 25 or 100mg.L-1, and analysed their microbiome composition and diversity at the end of the family life period. Our results showed that both social environment and cadmium exposure shaped the juvenile microbial community composition (phylogenetic beta-diversity), with no evidence of an interaction between these factors. In contrast, the microbial local richness (alpha-diversity) remained unaffected by either factor or their interaction. Notably, several specific bacterial taxa, including putatively pathogenic (Serratia) and mutualistic (Lactobacillus) symbionts, were more abundant in juveniles reared with family members than in those reared in isolation, reflecting classical patterns observed in social species. Overall, our findings suggest that while both social environment and cadmium shape the microbiome of earwig juveniles, family life neither amplifies nor mitigates the effects of chemical exposure.

(2014). Here, we introduce dlmoR, an open-source (MIT License) implementation of the hockeystick method written in R. Our clean-room implementation follows the original algorithm description, supported by iterative validation against the existing binary executable. We benchmarked dlmoR on 112 melatonin time series datasets from two independent studies (Heinrichs and Spitschan (2025); Blume et al.

It supports programmatic, reproducible analysis of melatonin profiles, including batch processing and parameter manipulation. Leveraging this flexibility, we evaluated the sensitivity of the hockey-stick algorithm to controlled changes in sampling schedules, threshold levels, data completeness, and noise. Moderate changes, such as small timing jitter, limited data loss, or modest threshold shifts, kept estimates stable within {+/-}10 minutes, whereas pronounced alterations to sampling schedules, large multi-point deletions, or substantial threshold changes delayed estimates by over 40 minutes or prevented estimation.

F.; Martinez, L.", "abstract": "In this work, the structure and thermodynamics of urea and TMAO preferential interactions across the complete folding landscape of the {beta}-sheet SH3 domain and the helical B domain of protein A (BdpA) are characterized. There is a high correlation between preferential interactions and the surface area of the denatured states, despite the fact that the chemical nature of the exposed surfaces upon denaturation differs from those of native states. For SH3, the denaturation always proceeds with an increase in surface area, such that the qualitative effect of cosolvents on the stability of all denatured states can be inferred from the preferential interactions in the native state. On the other hand, for BdpA, partially denatured states exist that are destabilized by urea; thus, unfolding pathways can be modulated by the cosolvent. Both urea and TMAO form hydrogen bonds with the proteins, which are weakened upon denaturation, and nonspecific interactions, which are strengthened in unfolded structures. Backbone, side chain, and specific residue contributions to distribution functions are obtained, illustrating, for instance, the crucial participation of urea-backbone and nonpolar-cosolvent interactions in the solvation mechanisms. Obtaining these results was possible using a novel computational pipeline to represent solvation structures throughout complete folding landscapes by means of coarse-grained and atomistic simulations and, crucially, the analysis of solvation using minimum-distance distribution functions and the Kirkwood-Buff solvation theory. Cosolvent effects on transfer free energies match experimental data within 1 kcal mol-1, supporting the nuanced description of the osmolyte-protein interplay.

Slow-dispersing edge specialists are likely to be most affected by local topography and land management practices, because they require two different adjacent habitats within their limited dispersal range. The northern hairy wood ant, Formica lugubris, requires adjacent forest and open habitats to access both aphid honeydew from trees, and direct sunlight for thermoregulation. In managed forests, canopy gaps that provide this combination are often linear and of anthropogenic origin, such as paths, firebreaks, and roads (collectively rides), and their orientation determines shade distribution. Using population data spanning 10 years, we ask how properties of rides, such as bearing and width, affect the distribution and dispersal of wood ant populations in the North York Moors, UK. Regardless of ride orientation, nests were more abundant on the north side of rides, where they receive more sunlight, and nests were generally larger on narrower rides, which are more shaded. We found that F. lugubris dispersed approximately 3 times quicker along rides that were oriented north-south or east-west compared with NE-SW or NW-SE, although N-S bearings were used more symmetrically than E-W bearings, where the north side was predominantly used. Our results clearly show that ride characteristics (width, orientation), resulting from forestry practices, can influence the distribution and dispersal of an ecosystem engineer woodland species.

In this study, we systematically characterized the binding and modification requirements of 20 A{beta}-Abs, including biosimilars of Aducanumab, Lecanemab, and Donanemab, across monomeric, oligomeric, and aggregated A{beta} forms. Array-based analysis of 20,000 modified A{beta} peptides defined binding epitopes at single-residue resolution and revealed the impact of sequence variation, including familial AD mutations, as well as diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs). Notably, genetic variants such as H6R impaired binding of therapeutic A{beta}-Abs like Aducanumab. Donanemab showed strong preference for pyroglutamate-modified A{beta} pE3-10, while Lecanemab and Aducanumab exhibited aggregation- and sequence-context-dependent binding requirements. Comparison of peptide binding profiles with binding of full-length and aggregated A{beta} via immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, capillary immunoassays, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry on AD brain tissue revealed distinct aggregation-dependent binding behaviours. The valency- and context-dependence of Aducanumab binding, together with its preference for Ser8-phosphorylated A{beta}, supports a dimerization-mediated binding mechanism.

To investigate shared and disorder-specific neurobiological impact of highly penetrant rare mutations in ASD and SCZ, we analyzed human single-nucleus whole-brain sequencing data to identify strongly affected brain cell types. Our analysis revealed Caudal Ganglionic Eminence (CGE)-derived GABAergic interneurons as a critical nexus for cognitive deficits across these disorders. Notably, genes within 22q11.2 deletions, known to confer a high risk of SCZ, ASD, and cognitive impairment, showed a strong expression bias toward vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing cells (VIP+) among CGE subtypes. To explore VIP+ GABAergic interneuron perturbations in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in vivo, we examined their activity in the Df(16)A+/- mouse model during a spatial navigation task and observed reduced activity along with altered responses to random rewards. At the population level, VIP+ interneurons exhibited impaired spatial encoding and diminished subtype-specific activity suggesting deficient disinhibition in CA1 microcircuits in the hippocampus, a region essential for learning and memory. Overall, these results demonstrate the crucial role of CGE-derived interneurons in mediating cognitive processes that are disrupted across a range of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We applied PiP-plex to analyze protein secreted by THP-1 cells upon exposure to lipopolysaccharide and detected varying cell responses, with a significant increase in MIP-1, TNF- and IL-17A. Multivariate analysis revealed that the majority of stimulated cells secreted either MIP-1 or IL-17A, while other cytokines were typically co-secreted.

We hypothesised that fructose metabolism in intestinal L-cells triggers GLP-1 secretion, which then potentiates insulin secretion and counteracts fructose-induced hyperglycaemia. To test this hypothesis, we systematically characterised metabolic responses across multiple mouse strains after 24 h ad libitum fructose ingestion. In both lean (NSY.B6-a/a) and obese diabetic (NSY.B6-Ay/a) mice, fructose elevated plasma insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). The insulin response was preserved in GIP receptor-deficient mice (Gipr-/-) but was abolished in proglucagon-deficient mice (Gcg-/-) by pharmacological GLP-1 receptor antagonism, indicating a requirement for GLP-1, but not GIP. Across strains, fructose-induced insulin response correlated with attenuation of post-fructose glycaemia, consistent with insulin being essential for suppressing fructose-induced hyperglycaemia. To explore the mechanism underlying fructose-induced GLP-1 secretion, we combined ATP-sensitive potassium channel-deficient mice (Kcnj11-/-), GLUTag L-cell line, and metabolic tracing of 13C-labelled fructose in freshly isolated intestinal crypts. These complementary approaches support a model in which fructolysis increases the ATP/ADP ratio in L-cells, closes KATP channels, and stimulates GLP-1 secretion. In obese diabetic mice, increased fructolytic flux and a higher ATP/ADP ratio were associated with elevated GLP-1 levels, further corroborating this model. Collectively, our findings indicate that intestinal fructose metabolism drives GLP-1 secretion required to potentiate insulin secretion, thereby establishing a gut-pancreas axis that counter-regulates fructose-induced hyperglycaemia.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

An important TCS that regulates the expression of genes involved in biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance in many pathogens is the BqsRS/CarRS system, originally identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Transcriptomics data suggested that the cognate PaBqsRS stimulus is Fe2+, but PaBqsS has not been characterized at the protein level, and a direct interaction between Fe2+ and PaBqsS has not been demonstrated. In this work, we biochemically and functionally characterize intact PaBqsS, an iron-sensing membrane HK, for the first time. Using bioinformatics, protein modeling, metal analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we show that PaBqsS binds a single Fe2+ ion within its periplasmic domain containing an N/O-rich ligation sphere that includes Glu48 as a key metal ligand. Using activity assays, we show that both intact and truncated PaBqsS have competent ATPase activities, consistent with predicted function. Importantly, we show that the ATP hydrolysis of intact PaBqsS is stimulated exclusively by Fe2+, revealing metal-based activation of a functional, intact membrane HK for the first time. Moreover, stimulation assays of PaBqsS variants demonstrate the importance of Glu45 and Asn49 in the sensing and signal transduction pathway. Taken together, this work uncovers important structural and biochemical properties that could be leveraged to target the BqsRS system for future therapeutic developments.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Genes and proteins must therefore have achieved modern lengths during a time comparable to the error in that date. How did that happen? We show here that E coli transformed with a double mutant full-length Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) produces discrete sets of shorter genes. These lack the anticodon-binding domain and large parts of the catalytic domain. They connect remote active site parts in two different ways. Large pre-steady-state bursts confirm that they are the active enzymes. These in vivo results validate earlier designs for ancient aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes, greatly expanding the sequence space of active synthetases. One construct joins the 56-residue protozyme directly to a 25-residue segment containing the second catalytic signature. It catalyzes both activation and minihelix acylation with amino acids. AlphaFold33 predicts that the mRNA sequence encoding the latter fragment is a long hairpin. Thus, 3D structures in the gene itself may promote the deletions. The deletions appear to reverse the modular evolution of full-length synthetases from simpler catalysts.

To establish an intracellular niche conducive to replication, L. pneumophila translocates a diverse array of effector proteins that manipulate various host cellular processes, including the actin cytoskeleton. In a screen for effectors that alter actin dynamics, we identified a Legionella effector, Lfat1 (lpg1387), which colocalizes with the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. Lfat1 specifically binds F-actin through a novel actin-binding domain (ABD). High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) analysis revealed that this ABD forms a long -helix hairpin, with its tip interacting with subdomains I and II of two adjacent actin molecules within the F-actin filament. Interestingly, while individual -helices of the hairpin fail to bind F-actin, co-expression as separate fusion proteins restores binding activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Lfat1 exhibits lysine fatty-acyltransferase (KFAT) activity, targeting host small GTPases. These findings establish a foundation for studying the KFAT family of bacterial toxins and uncover a novel F-actin binding motif, providing an alternative F-actin marker with notable flexibility.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We used a syngeneic mouse model to investigate the effects of ultra-high dose highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) on NB progression. Following tumor establishment, mice were randomized to receive daily oral gavage with omega-6 ({omega}6) arachidonic acid (ARA) at 4.7 g/d human equivalent (hEq), or omega-3 ({omega}3) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at 24 g/d hEq, and controls did not receive gavage. We observed strikingly divergent effects: ARA significantly promoted tumor growth, resulting in 100% tumor survival and 4-fold larger tumors compared to controls, with enhanced vascularization and invasive morphology. In contrast, DHA administration reduced tumor survival (40% versus 92% in controls) and significantly suppressed the progression of remaining tumors, with remaining DHA-treated tumors approximately 4.5-fold smaller than controls and 18-fold smaller than ARA-treated tumors. In a separate lipid mediator analysis, ARA supplementation significantly increased pro-inflammatory/pro-tumorigenic mediators including PGE2, TXB2, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in liver, spleen, brain and skeletal muscle. DHA supplementation increased anti-inflammatory/anti-tumor mediators, particularly EPA-derived 17,18-EpETE, 18-HEPE, and DHA-derived 14-HDHA in these same tissues. No significant differences in body weight were observed among treatment groups, indicating the treatments were well-tolerated. These findings build upon our previous research demonstrating that ultra-high dose {omega}3 supplementation can completely block tumor formation in MYCN-driven NB. The profound tumor-suppressive effects of DHA suggest that dietary modulation of {omega}3 and {omega}6 HUFA intake may offer a complementary, low-toxicity approach to high-risk NB standard of care (SoC).

While several proposed subtypes of AD exist, there is still no clear consensus on a definitive classification. By leveraging complementary AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised learning, within a recursive pipeline (SUMMER) that integrates multimodal datasets encompassing MRI measurements, phenotypes, and genetic data, our goal was to generate robust scientific evidence for identifying AD subtypes. Data was downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and included neuroimaging data (MRI), genetics (SNPs), clinical diagnosis, and demographics. 1133 European American participants' images, aged 55-95, were included in this study. The analysis was multi-fold, where the first step involved applying an unsupervised application to a subset of the MRI sample (AD + cognitively normal (CN) aged matched groups, 100 men aged 68-85 years, and 76 women aged 68-85 years). The MRI brain gray matter was segmented into 44 regions of interest (ROIs) according to a standard atlas, and 618 features were extracted, including ROI voxel intensity measurements such as minimum, maximum, and histogram variables. Results identified a cluster of subtype AD men and a cluster of subtype AD women that were distinct from the rest of their respective samples. In the next step, the integrity of the identified subtype AD clusters was investigated using the XGBoost supervised machine learning application with genetic features (SNPs, N=36,724) and labels: the identified subtype AD cluster vs. the rest of the sample, stratified by sex. A significant AD subtype men model (accuracy=0.85, F1=0.72, AUC=0.83) and a significant women AD subtype model (accuracy=0.81, F1=0.81, AUC=0.81) were built, confirming the homogeneity of the isolated AD subtype clusters. Discriminative biomarkers were extracted from the significant models, including selected ROIs and SNPs. Finally, the subtype models were tested on an unseen subset of ADNI data. The genetic-based models identified clusters of AD subtype participants consisting of 34% of the men AD group and 47% of the women AD group. Phenotypic analysis indicates that lower body weight was associated with the women's AD subtype. Complex diseases like AD demand a sophisticated, multimodal approach for precise diagnosis.

While EWSR1::ETS-high cells display a rather sessile but proliferative phenotype, EWSR1::ETS-low cells are more invasive. Yet, the mechanisms underlying these different phenotypes remain poorly characterized. Here, by employing an integrative functional metabolomics approach, we link reduced EWSR1::ETS activity in primary EwS tumors to adverse clinical outcome and pronounced activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. Low EWSR1::ETS states foster tryptophan catabolism and accumulation of the AHR agonist kynurenine, which in turn promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment characterized by impaired natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and enrichment of immunoregulatory infiltrates. Functionally, AHR silencing restores NK cell-mediated tumor recognition, while also directly suppressing EwS cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and spheroid growth in plasma-like media.

Applying stringent thresholds, a total of 26 genes in Typhimurium, 34 in Enteritidis, and 50 in Newport were found to significantly influence fitness during muskmelon interaction, with many of these being temperature dependent. Genes whose disruption affected fitness across all three serovars were enriched for functions related to RNA degradation and ribosome biogenesis. Targeted competition assays confirmed the contribution of selected genes, revealing nutrient-dependent phenotypes for most mutants. Remarkably, the polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase gene, pnp, and the D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase gene, serA, conferred a selective advantage when growing in muskmelon but not under nutrition-rich control conditions.

Indeed, stimulus repetition leads to classically described neuronal response decreases, and to more recently described neuronal gamma synchronization increases (sometimes preceded by decreases for a few trials). Here, we used a full-screen colored background (FSCB) and a flashed black bar, while recording multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFP) from area V1 of an awake macaque monkey. We found that the FSCB repetition induced neuronal response increases (sometimes preceded by decreases for a few trials) and gamma synchronization decreases (preceded by increases for a few trials). These effects are largely opposite to the dominant previous findings. Intriguingly, these surprising effects largely reversed when we isolated the responses to the flashed black bar. We discuss these findings, considering differences to previous studies with regards to the subject of the study, the stimuli and the task. We notice that in studies reporting classical results for gamma, sometimes in combination with firing rates, the stimuli were typically (partly) predictive of the reward.

Unlocking general principles of neuronal specification and wiring across the nervous system requires a systematic and high-resolution characterisation of its diversity, recently enabled by advances in single-cell transcriptomics and connectomics. However, linking the molecular identity of neurons to circuit architecture remains a key challenge. Here, we present a high-resolution developmental transcriptional atlas for the Drosophila melanogaster nerve cord, the central hub for sensory-motor circuits. With an unprecedented 38x coverage relative to its reference connectome1,2, our atlas captures extensive molecular diversity and enables robust alignment to the adult connectome. We identified three developmental principles underlying neuronal diversity in the nerve cord. First, timing of neurogenesis shapes molecular identity: embryonic-born neurons adopt discrete molecular identities, while larval-born neurons form continuous identities within lineages, a distinction we also found in the adult connectome. Second, we discovered that the continuous molecular progression is mirrored by the expression dynamics of 17 transcription factors. These factors are common to neurons from all lineages and provide a global molecular identity code based on birth order. Lastly, by mapping sex-specific transcriptional profiles to the connectome, we uncovered female-specific apoptosis and transcriptional divergence as key global drivers of sex-specification. By revealing key organisational axes of molecular identity, this atlas opens new avenues to dissect the molecular mechanisms underpinning the development and evolution of neural circuits.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

A major barrier that stands between implementing these findings into effective clinical treatments is the translational gap between rodent models and human patients. To date, no methods or protocols describe how to prepare viable human spinal cord slices for acute electrophysiological recordings. To bridge this translational divide, we describe here a protocol for the extraction of spinal cord tissue from consenting human organ donors and the preparation and sectioning of this tissue for acute spinal cord slice electrophysiology. With the collaboration of a transplant service and licensed surgeon, tissue can be extracted in 30-50 minutes. Acute spinal cord slices can then be prepared in the laboratory by trained graduate students in 2.5-5 hours, depending on the amount of tissue and scope of experiments. Using a viability stain to confirm that spinal slices are of sufficient quality to proceed, slices can then be used for either patch-clamp recordings to study the excitability of individual neurons or for high-density multielectrode array recordings to study intact sensory circuits. Slices remain viable for 4 to 8 hours, providing ample time for investigating synaptic and circuit-level signalling dynamics, including the use of pharmacological agents to probe the roles of specific molecular targets. The approaches described here can be implemented to improve translational physiological research and as a human tissue-based preclinical drug target identification and validation assay.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

TF-specific disruption of exocyst vesicle trafficking genes indicated that each TF stack continuously imports at least of 0.75 cubic microns of lipophilic molecules per day, and transfers them through the cellular stack into the GSC region. When lipid import between the TF and germ cells is cut off, LDs accumulate in TF cells, stem cell function and spectrosome size decreases, cyst formation and fusome structure is altered and follicle development becomes abnormal. Knockdown of organic anion transporter Oatp30B in the TF blocked the differentiation of GSC daughters, generating a tumor. The Oatp30B human ortholog SLCO5A1 has prognostic value in ovarian cancer.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each microorganism is determined at different light fluence rates within a clinically relevant range. Our results demonstrate that curcumin-mediated PDT effectively inactivates E. coli and C. auris, while exhibiting only partial inhibition against P. fluorescens at curcumin concentrations up to 60 M.

We established an HPLC-based method to sensitively evaluate the RCS-scavenging ability of compounds, using Acr as a representative RCS. Among 80% ethanol extracts of 46 angiosperm species, the highest scavenging activities were observed in garlic, spinach, avocado, broccoli, and lotus, representing a diverse range of plant families. The active ingredient from garlic cloves was identified as S-allyl cysteine sulfoxide (alliin), an amino acid typical of Allium species, which trapped up to two Acr molecules at its amino group. Notably, S-(1E)-propenyl cysteine sulfoxide (isoalliin), a structural analog of alliin and a major constituent of onion, showed even stronger Acr-scavenging activity. Isoalliin outperformed known Acr scavengers such as carnosine, epigallocatechin gallate, resveratrol, and hesperetin. These findings highlight isoalliin as a representative plant-derived RCS scavenger and emphasize the importance of S-alk(en)yl cysteine sulfoxides as potent Acr-scavenging compounds in plants.

Notably, cardiac wasting is prominent in cancer patients and cancer survivors. Cachexia studies present significant challenges due to the absence of human models and mainly short-term animal studies. To address this translational gap, we have developed a robust human-based cachexia experimental approach characterized by marked cardiac muscle wasting and contractile dysfunction, with increased expression of protein degradation markers. Using human iPSC-derived cardiac muscle, we investigated morphological, functional, and metabolic alterations in the key stages of cachexia and in the post-cachexia phase. C26 and HCT116 tumor cell lines were used to induce cachexia by two methods, pulse addition of cancer cell conditioned media or in transwell-adapted co-culture. Cachectic cardiac myocytes exhibited reduced contraction amplitude, prolonged relaxation time, and increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), as assessed by video-based and Seahorse analyses. Mechanistic investigations centered on the Atrogin-1/Calcineurin A/NFAT axis revealed this signaling pathway as a central driver of cachexia-induced cardiac atrophy. Cachectic cardiac myocytes exhibited significant upregulation of Atrogin-1, leading to a marked decrease in Calcineurin A protein levels. This, in turn, impaired nuclear translocation of NFAT, thereby suppressing its transcriptional activity and downstream cell growth signaling. These molecular changes were accompanied by increased autophagic flux, as indicated by elevated LC3BII/LC3BI ratios. Furthermore, withdrawal of cachexia-inducing stimuli followed by regular media changes for one week led to normalization of Atrogin-1 and autophagy markers; however, functional impairments and metabolic dysregulation persisted, highlighting delayed recovery. Our new findings establish the Atrogin-1/Calcineurin A/NFAT axis as a key regulatory mechanism in cardiac muscle wasting and suggest this aberrant signaling axis may serve as a targetable mechanism for treatment of cachexia-induced cardiac dysfunction.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Our data show that, in addition to its well-characterized partner, MTR4 helicase (MTREX), as well as several splicing factors, NRDE2 also interacts with chromatin-associated factors involved in transcription, including the Polymerase-Associated Factor 1 (PAF1) complex and elongating forms of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII).

When reaching to a target object, gaze shifts away from the reach target to a secondary saccade target, presented during the reach, are delayed until after the reach target has been attained--a phenomenon known as gaze anchoring. Here, we compared gaze anchoring in human participants when reaching to a visual target versus a visual-haptic target providing force feedback upon contact. We also examined gaze anchoring in a bimanual context in which participants were instructed to shift their gaze to the secondary saccade target as soon as it appeared and, at the same time, move their other hand to the secondary saccade target. We found that, during the reaching movement, gaze was anchored to the target for both visual and visual-haptic targets. Whereas in the visual condition gaze appeared to be anchored until the end of the reaching movement, in the visual-haptic condition, gaze appeared to be anchored until the hand was close to the target (i.e., the end of the directing phase). In two-handed reaching, gaze anchoring was observed but anchoring did not extend to the left hand, which started moving before the eyes. Overall, our findings indicate that the timing of eye and hand movements in object manipulation is linked to the function of target fixations.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

E.; Kravitz, A.", "abstract": "Deficits in social motivation are a core feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders. While a range of tools have been developed to quantify social motivation in rodents, most rely on brief tests in dedicated apparatuses that can introduce stress and novelty, potentially reducing test reliability. Most current approaches are also typically not suited to studying learning across days or circadian rhythms of social motivation. To address these challenges, we developed a social operant task that can run around-the-clock for multiple days in the mouse homecage, continuously monitoring social motivation around the circadian cycle. The task consists of a custom-built automated door that was installed between two rodent homecages and configured so one mouse could trigger the door to open with a nose-poke action from within their cage. When open, the door allows for social interaction with the neighboring mouse through a perforated stainless-steel panel, which did not allow the mice to cross over into the neighboring cage. Mice opened the door multiple times each day, allowing us to quantify their amount and daily rhythms of social motivation. In our first experiment, C57BL/6J mice (both sexes) were individually housed with an empty adjacent cage for five days, after which a same-sex social partner was introduced for another nine days. Mice opened the door at significantly higher rates when the social partner was present vs. absent, confirming that mice were motivated to earn social interaction. This task also revealed a circadian rhythm to social motivation that peaked about 2 hours after the peak in their feeding rhythm. We speculate that mice first addressed their caloric needs each day before changing their priority to social behavior. Given prior literature implicating the dopamine system in social motivation, we also tested whether dopamine antagonists would block social motivation in our task in a new group of 14 mice (both sexes). The dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (delivered systemically at 0.3mg/kg SC) reduced social seeking without affecting locomotor activity or food intake, demonstrating a selective role for dopamine D1 receptors in social motivation. The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (delivered systemically at 0.3mg/kg SC) also reduced social seeking, but reduced locomotor activity and food intake as well, demonstrating a general reduction in behavior that was not specific to social motivation. Overall, our task offers a way for studying social motivation in the rodent homecage, which has advantages for studying disorders that involve both social and circadian disruptions.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

B.; Li, C.; De Smet, J.; Tomberlin, J. K.", "abstract": "ENGLISH ABSTRACTFor those researching reproduction of the black soldier fly (BSF), finding meaningful correlations between mating and downstream reproductive fitness metrics, owing to complex reproductive behavior and physiology, has been challenging. On the one hand, mating is not necessarily deterministic of fertile eggs being produced, since females might lay unfertile eggs both before and after mating. But conversely, the process is not  random either, since fertility is predicated on the exchange of gametes during mating. To investigate the relationship between mating and other reproductive metrics, a cross-correlation analysis between lagged time series was conducted on data previously collected during a semi-outdoor greenhouse experiment. This process compared the average percent correlation between un-lagged mating with oviposition in traps, oviposition outside traps, total weight of eggs deposited, and hatch rate, which were lagged 0 to -6 days. This revealed that average mating was 97.54% correlated with oviposition in traps lagged by -2 days. For oviposition outside of traps, total egg weights, and hatch rate, these were also [~]71.63% correlated, 60.29% correlated, and 75.16% correlated with mating respectively, which were optimized when the time series were lagged n = -3 days. These trends likely have a biological basis since flies decrease their reproductive activity as they expend energy and senesce, aligning with temporal patterns consistently observed during BSF rearing.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Electron microscopy identified a gradient of epibiotic bacterial colonization within the cephalothoracic cavity, ranging from absent to dense filamentous mats, suggesting distinct trophic strategies. Isotope and lipid trophic markers confirmed difference in reliance on chemosynthetic production among sympatric species with different bacterial colonization from a single vent. Phylogenetic analysis reveals at least two independent origins of chemosymbiosis, suggesting evolutionary convergence. Microhabitat association data further show that symbiotic phenotypes are most common in shrimps occupying the hottest, most geofluid-enriched microhabitats, though exceptions suggest contributions from additional ecological or physiological constraints. Our findings reveal many alvinocaridids as gradually evolving towards symbiosis, highlighting the importance of intermediate cases to understand the pathways to chemosymbiosis.

J.; Lozano, A.", "abstract": "Animal models can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying stress-related disorders. Yet, significant translational challenges persist, as laboratory behavioral assays are often reductionistic, with limited attention to ethologically relevant behavioral diversity. Recent advances in high-throughput pose-estimation tools and computational ethology methods are addressing this limitation by enhancing the resolution and validity of behavioral phenotyping. In this context, it is known that early life stress (ELS) reshapes how animals handle subsequent threats later in life, but the fine-scale dynamics and ethological details of this shift remain elusive. To overcome this, we combined a deep-learning pose-estimation pipeline (DeepLabCut) with a supervised freezing classifier (SimBA) and an unsupervised behavioral motifs identification platform (keypoint MoSeq) to study in detail the diversity and dynamics of behavior in an auditory fear-conditioning (FC) paradigm in two independent cohorts of adult male mice that were exposed to ELS through the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm. We first validated the blunted freezing response after ELS in a supervised manner using SimBA. Next, keypoint MoSeq segmented the same pose-estimation data into ethologically meaningful motifs over time. When compared to control animals, ELS offspring showed an altered FC response, reduced behavioral entropy and limited diversity in their behavioral repertoire. Such response was characterized by longer active-behavior bouts and more recurrent transitions between states, indicating a more stereotyped and predictable response. Multidimensional scaling of time-binned behavioral vectors and distance metrics identified a resilient subpopulation within the ELS group that displayed a control-like behavioral profile, characterized by a steeper increase in freezing behavior during the FC task and a more diverse behavioral repertoire with reduced recurrence of stereotyped actions, less frequent and shorter active bouts and prolonged passive responses. Overall, our findings suggest that ELS shifts the balance between passive and active coping strategies and that resilience is marked by a less stereotypical yet more diverse and flexible behavioral response to a subsequent stressful demand. Finally, we further validated the unsupervised behavioral motifs with a predictive model that identified distinctive kinematic features of these responses, which could be used to build new behavioral classifiers that can be applied in other behavioral paradigms. These results demonstrate the potential of computational ethology to dissect complex behavioral patterns and improve our understanding of individual stress responses. By combining supervised and unsupervised behavioral analysis tools, we can deepen our understanding of the latent structure of stress behavior and identify objective markers of vulnerability and resilience.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We studied how aging affects GSC fitness in the protochordate Botryllus schlosseri, an evolutionary crosspoint between invertebrates and vertebrates. GSCs were isolated and distinguished from developing and mature gametes using flow cytometry and scRNA-Seq, facilitated by a new PacBio genome assembly. Moreover, their function was validated through a novel lineage tracing approach that combines membrane-labeled GSC transplantation with scRNA-Seq. Leveraging our method to isolate them, single-cell transcriptomics showed significant age-related changes between young and old GSCs. Spermatids and sperm, however, showed minimal changes, suggesting that reproductive aging is governed by GSCs rather than by gametes. Reduced expressions of markers like DDX4 and PIWIL1 in aged GSCs mirrored trends in mammalian datasets, pointing to a conserved GSC-driven aging mechanism across chordate evolution.

L.", "abstract": "People living with HIV suffer multiple comorbid conditions related to chronic inflammation at increased rates compared to the general population, even when on effective antiretroviral therapy. In particular, current data indicate that the increased incidence and severity of neurocognitive impairment (NCI) are associated with unresolved neuroinflammation. Attempts to treat NCI in people living with HIV by reducing inflammation have thus far been unsuccessful, suggesting that a more mechanistic understanding of inflammatory processes in the CNS during HIV is necessary. Here, we use iPSC-derived microglia (iMg) and astrocytes (iAst) to model HIV infection in the CNS. We show that our iMg robustly express markers associated with microglial identity and are susceptible to HIV infection, but exhibit lower HIV replication rates and weaker immune response to HIV challenge compared to monocyte-derived macrophages. Coculture of iAst with iMg leads to a much stronger pro- inflammatory immune response, and, surprisingly, a robust increase in rates of HIV replication. Increased replication in iMg/iAst cocultures is associated with higher levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFa, which is produced by iAst upon exposure to HIV-infected iMg. Addition of exogenous TNFa to iMg during HIV infection is also sufficient to increase rates of replication, and neutralization of TNFa via adalimumab/Humira treatment in iMg/iAst cocultures reduces replication. Blocking NF-kB signaling with iKK inhibitor Bay-11-7082 (Bay-11) demonstrates that increased HIV replication in iMg/iAst cocultures is due to increased NF-kB activity. Finally, we show that in HIV-infected iMg there is movement of lysosomes to the periphery of the cell membrane and release of lysosomal content into the extracellular space, suggesting that this dysregulated lysosomal flux could further contribute to the pro-inflammatory microenvironment. We propose that this altered lysosomal trafficking and increased cytokine production drives a pro-inflammatory phenotype in glia and represents a potential source of unresolved neuroinflammation in people living with HIV.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Following injection, animals showed reduced mechanical withdrawal thresholds at 5 g and 10 g doses of NGF and changes in circadian rhythm and feeding initiation following injection of 10 g of NGF. Animals did not show evidence of jaw dysfunction, masticatory alterations, or grimace during novel behavioural assays. The model is transient, with pain resolution occurring approximately 7 days after onset, which allows for repeated testing on the same animal. This same NGF-TMD model has been previously validated in rodents and humans and presents an opportunity for forward and reverse translation to examine mechanisms, develop relevant pain assessment tools, and ultimately test novel treatments for TMD and other musculoskeletal pain conditions.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

While PD progression is thought to be driven by a prion-like spread of Syn aggregates between neurons, the role of astrocytes remains unclear. Observations of Syn pathology in PD patient astrocytes suggest their potential involvement in processing aggregates. To investigate this, we studied astrocytes' interactions with Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) and their effects in astrocyte-neuron co-cultures on the spread of seed-competent Syn. Primary astrocytes quickly internalized and degraded Syn PFFs. However, degradation was significantly hindered by lysosome-compromising agents like chloroquine, Leupeptin, or CA-074. Adding astrocytes to neuron cultures reduced endogenous Syn aggregation, indicating their role in mitigating Syn pathology. When lysosome efficiency in astrocytes was compromised, their anti-seeding effect diminished. Moreover, lysosome-compromised astrocytes preloaded with Syn PFFs enhanced Syn pathology in neurons, whereas unimpaired astrocytes did not. These findings suggest astrocytes can modulate and contribute to Syn pathology spread, playing a significant role in PD pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We previously demonstrated that electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from children with ASD reveals impaired neuronal entrainment to predictable visual sequences. Whether similar effects are reflected in other physiological signals remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether eye movement and pupil dilation responses exhibit comparable entrainment differences in ASD. Microsaccades (MS) and pupil diameter were recorded from 31 children with ASD (6-9 years) and 21 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) controls during a task in which four equally spaced visual cues preceded an auditory target. We analyzed modulation of MS release time (MS RT) and pupil response time (pupil RT), along with trial-by-trial variability, as indices of ocular entrainment. Both groups exhibited periodic oculomotor responses to the cues, including phasic MS inhibition and repeated pupil constrictions. In TD children, MS RT and pupil RT increased across cues while their variability decreased, consistent with progressive temporal alignment. These effects were significantly reduced in the ASD group. Oculomotor entrainment measures correlated with EEG inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) in TD but not ASD children. They also correlated with behavioral response times in both groups, and moderately correlated with autism severity scores. Children with ASD thus showed diminished oculomotor modulation and greater variability in response to predictable stimuli, paralleling earlier EEG findings. These results suggest convergence across physiological systems in indexing impaired processing of predictability in ASD and highlight the promise of multimodal approaches.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We then assessed behavioral signs of pain or thermal dysregulation by testing evoked hindpaw withdrawal responses to mechanical and thermal heating stimuli and temperature preferences at four weeks after injury. For 2-3 days after injury, mice exhibited sharp decreases in movement and RR variability, but these two parameters were uncorrelated within animals. Mice showed signs of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity and preferences for warmer temperatures four weeks after injury. Interestingly, mice that moved the least 1 day after SCI preferentially underwent hindpaw mechano-sensitivity (r = 0.67, p = .036), whereas mice with large decreases in RR variability that recovered by 8 days post-injury preferred higher temperatures in the thermal preference test (r = 0.79, p = .007).

Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Fam210a (Fam210aHKO) in mice caused early growth restriction, reduced body and liver mass, and pronounced hepatic steatosis with glycogen depletion. These defects were accompanied by lower postprandial glucose levels in the fasted-refeeding state, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reduced mtDNA content, and abnormal cristae architecture. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed broad suppression of fatty acid, sterol, and bile acid metabolism, with concomitant glutathione stress responses. Mechanistically, FAM210A deficiency disrupted the YME1L-OPA1 axis, driving excessive OPA1 cleavage and cristae destabilization. Strikingly, these juvenile defects were transient and resolved by adulthood, underpinned by enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and mitochondrial biogenesis, consistent with a compensatory stress-adaptive response via the activation of ISR signaling.

The standard way to deal with stochasticity involves averaging over an ensemble of independent realizations. However, such mean statistics need not accurately reflect the typical outcomes in any finite sample unless the system satisfies the property of ergodicity, which guarantees that each trajectory will over time experience the same statistics as the entire ensemble. Here, we argue that, in contrast, non-ergodicity might instead be the rule rather than exception in real biological systems and investigate its implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics through three case-studies. First, we show how demographic stochasticity leads to ergodicity breaking where the asymptotic growth rate carries a signature of the initial condition. This motivates us to define a mutant establishment threshold, which quantifies a critical population size above which the typical mutant population starts to grow. Second, we consider environmental stochasticity and demonstrate that autocorrelated environmental variation does not average out in time, which has the important consequence that the fitness of a genotype cannot be simply averaged over the environments. Finally, we show how in a metapopulation structure the evolutionary dynamics within a typical subpopulation can deviate from the ensemble dynamics in the entire metapopulation, which is sufficient to explain the evolution and persistence of cooperation despite a fitness cost.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

The Saxicola torquatus complex comprises several widely distributed insectivorous bird species across the Palearctic and Afrotropical realms. Nevertheless, the evolutionary history within this complex remains contentious, and previous findings suggest complication caused by cytonuclear discordance. Here, we conducted a phylogenomic analysis of nearly complete taxa within the complex using genome-wide SNVs to investigate potential causes of phylogenetic discordance across genomic regions and elucidate its evolutionary history. We detected multiple reticulate events during their diversification, leading to extensive phylogenetic discordance across the genome. The mitochondrial genome and W chromosome exhibited a consistent gene tree that conflicted with the species tree, with introgression being the most plausible explanation among several hypotheses. The Z chromosome was less affected by ILS/introgression and exhibited relatively stable local phylogenies compared to autosomes. Furthermore, we found that strongly introgressed regions were predominantly concentrated at the ends of smaller chromosomes, and the strength of introgression among species pairs showed consistently positive correlations, likely attributed to shared recombination hotspots in these regions.

Using a flow reactor system with increased dilution frequency over 5000 h (15,000 generations), we observed reduced diversity and frequent extinctions in later experimental stages. Co-replication assays of RNA clones revealed that the primary cause of this diversity loss was shortened reaction time due to frequent dilution. Further analysis of RNA clones that emerged during evolution suggested that the frequent extinctions resulted from the dominance of host species that had either lost parasite resistance or exhibited reduced replication ability.

Here, we use whole-genome resequencing in North American fishes to show that two hybridizing species possess distinct, nonhomologous sex chromosomes. These chromosomes exhibit strong associations with sex, reduced introgression in natural hybrid zones, segregation distortion in backcrosses, and an enrichment of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, indicative of sex-linked mitonuclear incompatibilities.

In QTL studies, an alternative to data reduction is the use of post-hoc data summarization approaches, such as hotspot analysis, which involves mapping individual traits and consolidating results based on shared genomic locations. To evaluate how different analytical approaches may alter the biological insights derived from multi-dimensional QTL datasets, we compared individual trait hotspots with PCA-based QTL mapping using transcriptomic and metabolomic data from a structured recombinant inbred line population. Interestingly, these two approaches identified different genomic regions and genetic architectures. These findings suggest that mapping PCA-reduced data does not merely streamline analyses but may generate a fundamentally different view of the underlying genetic architecture compared to individual trait mapping and hotspot analysis.

Although immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface is critical for successful pregnancy, the immune disruptions that contribute to RPL, independent of fetal aneuploidy, remain poorly characterized. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of decidual tissues from RPL patients and gestational age-matched controls. We employed single-cell transcriptomics coupled with genotype-based origin analysis to dissect immune dysregulation in RPL. To identify cell type-specific RPL signatures, we mutually applied a supervised machine learning model and foundation model-based analysis, followed by pathway enrichment and network analysis. In addition, we prioritized drug repurposing candidates based on the drug response data, which reversed the RPL-associated transcriptional profiles. Results: In normal pregnancy, fetal immune cells were nearly absent but increased in RPL, whereas fetal trophoblasts were reduced, suggesting hindered placental development despite the absence of chromosomal abnormalities in fetal cells. Interestingly, by showing a strong common rejection module score, RPL immune cells resemble the transcriptional signatures of acute transplant rejection, indicating the contribution of the maternal immune system. Our machine learning and transformer-based models mutually identified T-cell-derived transcriptomic signatures that distinguished RPL immune cells. By examining biological confounding factors, including fetal-origin signatures, we prioritized CXCR4 and JUN in maternal T cells as RPL-associated signatures. For clinical application, we explored reversed transcriptional signatures from drug response data, and three compounds were highlighted as candidates for drug repurposing. Conclusions: Together, our approach identifies maternal immune signatures such as those of CXCR4 and JUN and links them to potential drug repurposing candidates, thereby providing both mechanistic insights and therapeutic opportunities for RPL.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

However, limited understanding of {gamma}-globin (HBG1/2) regulation constrains development of therapeutic interventions. BCL11A, a key transcriptional repressor of {gamma}-globin, is central to HbF silencing during adult erythropoiesis. Here, we identify a new post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving the lncRNA-UCA1 and miR-148b that modulates BCL11A expression. Using UCA1 knockdown and overexpression strategies, combined with in vivo crosslinking and transcriptomic analyses, we demonstrate that UCA1 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), sequestering miR-148b and thereby attenuating its repressive effect on BCL11A. In the present study, we have elucidated the physiological significance of this interaction in adult erythroid cells, including CD34 HSPCs and HUDEP-2 cells, in which UCA1 depletion led to robust {gamma}-globin induction, a phenotype recapitulated by miR-148b overexpression. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis and highlight the UCA1/miR-148b axis as a potential therapeutic target for HbF reactivation in {beta}-hemoglobinopathies.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Regular exercise is associated with higher cardiorespiratory fitness, commonly assessed by peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) during maximal effort testing. Higher cardiorespiratory fitness has been linked to preserved brain health, particularly higher grey matter volume and perfusion. The brain relies heavily on oxidative metabolism, yet the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and brain oxidative metabolism remains underexplored. This study investigated the association between VO2peak and two key cerebral metabolic parameters: the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), which represents the balance between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CMRO2. Thirty-seven healthy adults aged [&ge;]50 underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing for VO2peak assessment. Neuroimaging included dual calibrated functional MRI (dc-fMRI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Higher VO2peak correlated positively with higher CBF across whole-brain grey matter but showed no relationship with CMRO2. Conversely, higher VO2peak negatively correlated with lower OEF from both dc-fMRI and QSM. These findings suggest that greater cardiorespiratory fitness enhances cerebral perfusion without changing resting metabolic rate in healthy older adults, resulting in a reduced oxygen extraction. These results are consistent with exercise yielding improved vascular-metabolic coupling, which would reduce the likelihood of transient hypoxic episodes.

C. J.; Tockovska, T.; Lozano Casasbuenas, D.; Chanphao, H.; Treanor, B.; Faiz, M.; Yuzwa, S. A.", "abstract": "Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Ischemic stroke mobilizes adult neural stem cells (NSCs) out of the quiescent state. The multifaceted responses of endogenous NSCs to ischemic stroke involve proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Hence one strategy which could be leveraged for recovery after ischemic stroke is the intrinsic mechanism of endogenous NSC mobilization. However, the survival rate of recruited endogenous NSCs is low. Moreover, the intercellular signals that activate NSCs after ischemic stroke are poorly understood. We hypothesized that after stroke, cells located in the cerebral lesion send signals to the NSC niche to initiate the regenerative response. To test this hypothesis, we used CellChat to computationally infer the cell-cell communication between the ischemic infarct region and ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) NSC niche from spatial gene expression profiles. We identified ligand-receptor pairs and signaling pathways involved in the signal transduction events at 2, 10, and 21 days after stroke. Out of several candidate genes of interest we identified, here we reported the regulatory function of galectin-9 on the proliferation of NSCs. Our present work portrays galectin-9 as a checkpoint signaling molecule that guards the responses of NSCs under physiological conditions and potentially during the recovery phase post-ischemic stroke. We suggest that TIM-3 mediates the inhibitory effect of galectin-9 on NSC proliferation and propose a working hypothesis that the stroke-induced proinflammatory factors stimulate the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on ependymal cells and result in the increased secretion of galectin-9, which in turn modulates neighboring NSCs.

Beyond its immediate function of enhancing lipid catabolism for alternative energy sources, stress-induced H3K27ac activates lifelong antioxidant defenses, thereby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by stress-induced fatty acid oxidation and their accumulation during aging. The increase in H3K27ac, mediated by pioneer factor PHA-4/FOXA and cooperating transcription factor NHR-49/HNF4, is crucial for lifespan extension under hermetic nutrient stress in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Combining experiments and theoretical modeling, we identify a positive feedback loop in which the mechanosensitive behavior of the atypical cadherin Fat2 synergizes with the rigid-body dynamics of the egg chamber to both initiate and sustain rotation. Mechanical constraints arising from cell-cell interactions and tissue geometry further align this motion around the egg chamber's anterior-posterior axis.

P.; Schick, G.; Del Corpo, J.; Piekny, A.", "abstract": "In cytokinesis, a contractile ring constricts the cell to form two daughters. After ingression, the ring matures into the midbody, and an intercellular bridge connects the daughter cells until it is cut during abscission. Ring assembly requires the activation of RhoA GTPase at the equatorial cortex by Ect2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). However, it is unclear if RhoA must be inactivated after ring closure to complete cytokinesis. Here, we show that the nuclear sequestration of Ect2 after ingression is required for cytokinesis. Mutating the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in Ect2 causes it to remain at the midbody where it generates persistent active RhoA, leading to cytokinesis failure. Re-localizing the mutant to the nucleus using SV40NLS restores cytokinesis. Further, over-expression of mutant Ect2 causes cytokinesis failure, which is rescued by reducing GEF activity. We propose that persistent RhoA causes instability in the intercellular bridge, preventing abscission.

Clinical features include postnatal microcephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, neutropenia, and retinal dystrophy. VPS13B belongs to the bridge-like lipid transfer protein (BLTP) family, which also includes VPS13A, VPS13C, and VPS13D in mammals. Although its precise function remains unclear, VPS13B localizes to the Golgi complex, and its loss leads to Golgi fragmentation, a consistent cellular phenotype observed in VPS13B-deficient models. We used the rescue of this cell-autonomous phenotype as the basis for a microscopy-based high-throughput screening assay, through which we identified several small molecules capable of restoring Golgi morphology. Most of these compounds shared a common mechanism of action, relying on lipid accumulation in acidic organelles due to their cationic amphiphilic properties (CADs). Lipidomic profiling revealed a reduction in C18-N-acyl sphingolipids as a characteristic feature of VPS13B knockout (KO) cells, a defect that was reversed by the majority of the identified compounds. To evaluate the physiological relevance of these findings, we tested two compounds, azelastine and raloxifene, in cortical organoids (COs) derived from VPS13B KO human pluripotent stem cells. These organoids exhibited smaller size and reduced neurite outgrowth, reminiscent of the secondary microcephaly observed in CS patients. Treatment with either compound significantly recovered the neurite outgrowth phenotype, reinforcing physiological relevance of the compound effect. Taken together, our findings highlight a potential effect of the CAD on lysosome-dependent sphingolipid regulation, allowing the recovery of Golgi integrity and partial rescue in the cortical organoid CS model. Although additional studies are required to delineate the exact molecular targets, this work uncovers a potential mechanism that could be leveraged for the treatment of CS.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We exposed these slices to increasing glucose concentrations and applied our semi-automatic analysis pipeline to detect thousands of individual beta cells followed by identification of individual Ca2+ spiking events. We observed that CR beta cells have fast short-amplitude Ca2+ oscillations that correlate with largely disconnected beta cell networks across the islet.

Here, we show that ER stress selectively disperse Bud2, a GAP for Bud1/Rsr1, serving its canonnical role in cell polarity while integrating it into ER homeostasis signaling. Bud2 dispersion results in accelerated spindle pole body (SPB) duplication, spindle misorientation, defects in nuclear migration, and genome segregation errors under ER stress. Strikingly, a C-terminal truncation of Shs1, shs1-{Delta}CTD, recapitulated the ER stress-induced dispersion of Bud2 phenotype even in the absence of ER stress, and delayed cell-cycle re-entry after ER homeostasis was regained-despite normal occurrence of typical ERSU hallmark events.

Improving the resilience and stimulating tissue repair after injury is crucial to prevent AKI-to-CKD transition. Using a combination of transcription factors (Yamanaka factors Oct4, Klf4 and Sox2, (OKS)) to partially reprogram tissues and enhance regeneration in vivo, could be a promising approach as shown by amelioration after various organ injury, yet not investigated for AKI to date. Methods: We used a ubiquitously and kidney-specific transgenic mouse model to investigate OKS expression in kidney. In a kidney-specific model using Pax8-Cre, we then induced AKI via aristolochic acid (AA), simultaneously expressing OKS to determine potential protective effects after kidney injury. Results: We show that a ubiquitously expressing OKS-mouse model was not suitable due to toxic effects and limited kidney expression. In the Pax8-Cre mouse model, we observed expression almost exclusively to proximal tubules. While induction for more than 3 days caused dysplastic tumor formation, an induction regimen limited to 3 days was not able to improve phenotypic outcome after AA-injury. Conclusion: Partial reprogramming of the kidney using OKS is feasible; however, it requires a delicate balance to the risk of oncogenic transformation.

Despite the established role for TGF- signaling in promoting vascular remodeling and suppressing the senolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells, the contribution of NK cell TGF- signaling to postnatal lung patterning and the pathogenesis of BPD remains unclear. Methods: Mice bearing an NK cell-selective deletion of the type-II TGF- receptor (Tgfbr2NK-/-) were analyzed for vascular and alveolar structure, lung NK cell infiltration, senescence markers and lung function testing across neonatal and adult timepoints. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung tissue from both neonatal mice and human infants with BPD was performed. The effect of enhanced NK cell activity in a hyperoxia-induced model of BPD was assessed in Tgfbr2NK-/- neonates, as well as pharmacologically, using the TGF- ligand trap/IL-15 superagonist, HCW9218. Results: Neonatal Tgfbr2NK-/- mice exhibited a baseline reduction in distal arteriolar density, impaired alveolarization, and sex-specific deficits in long-term lung function. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified the excessive clearance of senescent endothelial cells by TGF- insensitive NK cells in the lungs of Tgfbr2NK-/- neonates, which served as a contributor of the BPD-like phenotype observed in nave animals. Tgfbr2NK-/- mice were protected from impaired lung development in the hyperoxia model. Sequencing from lung tissue from infants with BPD confirmed excessive TGF- signaling and cytotoxic impairment in NK cells. Treatment with HCW9218 prevented senescent cell accumulation and rescued lung development in the hyperoxia mouse model.

OTA is hypothesized to be a potential environmental agent causing chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu), however the mechanism of OTA toxicity in the human kidney remains elusive. This study aims to elucidate OTA-induced molecular toxicological pathways using primary human proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs). We demonstrated that exposure to OTA (10 M) induces over 7000 differentially expressed genes, including key regulators of mitochondrial fission and fusion. This was confirmed at the cellular level by confocal microscopy, where a breakdown of the mitochondrial network was observed at 100 nM OTA. Crucially, OTA was found to significantly inhibit basal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as well as glycolysis, indicating reduced bioenergetics and mitochondrial toxicity. In conclusion, we demonstrate that OTA induces mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP production, leading to a senescent-like state in PTECs characteristic of renal disease progression. These findings provide insight into early toxicological endpoints induced by OTA which have been established as pathophysiological changes involved in chronic kidney disease.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Piper methysticum, known as Kava, is a traditional Pacific Island phytomedicine with clinically validated anxiolytic properties, primarily attributed to its Kavalactones. However, the biogeographically restricted distribution of Piper methysticum and the ecological and cultural concerns surrounding its widespread adoption highlight the need to explore alternative sources within the Piper genus. This study investigates whether other species within the Piper genus, used phytomedically in non-Pacific contexts, exhibit similar therapeutic efficacy for anxiety, stress, and related disorders including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). We employed a computational approach utilizing a novel data platform of non-Western phytomedical pharmacopeias to analyze the secondary metabolomes of various Piper species. Network analysis and multidimensional data projections were used to compare the chemical composition and therapeutic indications of these species with those of Piper methysticum. Our findings suggest that while Kavalactones are predominantly unique to Piper methysticum, other Piper species also contain bioactive compounds associated with anxiolytic and stress-relieving effects. These results provide insight into the potential for culturally and biogeographically contextualized approaches to PTSD treatment, beyond the exclusive use of Kava, and lay the groundwork for future research into alternative phytomedicinal therapies within the Piper genus.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 57 participants viewing three image types: natural scenes, texture-synthesized versions that preserve global summaries of local statistics while disrupting global form, and isolated objects without backgrounds. Representational-similarity analysis showed the strongest DNN-EEG alignment when both systems processed texture-synthesized images. When using features from one image condition to predict EEG responses to another, we showed that features from texture-synthesized images generalized to natural scenes. Crucially, we observed a dissociation between DNN-EEG alignment and decodable object category information: alignment increased for texture-synthesized images even when object information was reduced. Together, our findings identify global summaries of local image statistics as a common currency linking DNNs and human visual processing, clarifying that global form features are not required for high DNN-EEG alignment.

Here we show that in Caehnorhabditis elegans the conserved SIN3 transcriptional coregulator is required for animals to adapt to different bacterial diets. Shifting sin-3 mutant animals from the commonly used E. coli OP50 strain to the E. coli HT115 strain used for RNAi knockdown experiments has a dramatic impact on survival, leading to lethality at the young adult stage. A major difference between OP50 and HT115 is vitamin B12 content, which is lower in OP50 than HT115. Feeding sin-3 mutant animals on OP50 bacteria supplemented with vitamin B12 reproduced the lethality observed on HT115. Vitamin B12 functions in two metabolic pathways: the canonical propionate breakdown pathway and the methionine/S-adenosylmethionine (Met/SAM) cycle. Loss of metr-1, encoding the methionine synthase enzyme that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor in the Met/SAM cycle repressed lethality on HT115, while complementation with metabolites of this pathway enhanced lethality on OP50.

However, blood ingestion also introduces physiological stressors, including thermal, osmotic, and oxidative stress, particularly during the digestion of heme-containing proteins. In Drosophila melanogaster, oxidative stress response genes are regulated by the circadian clock, and core circadian transcription factors are redox-sensitive. Additionally, sufficient iron ingestion is necessary to maintain normal circadian behaviors, as iron metabolism genes influence circadian behaviors, and flies lacking iron storage and transport are arrhythmic. However, whether similar interactions between iron metabolism and circadian rhythms exist in mosquitoes remains unclear. Here, we leverage the known alteration of mosquitoes' activity rhythms following a bloodmeal to investigate whether dietary hemoglobin contributes to post-feeding activity suppression and gene regulation in the female Ae. aegypti. Using vertebrate blood and artificial blood mimic diets of equal nutritional values but with and without hemoglobin, we compared mosquito egg production, locomotor activity, sleep profiles, and transcript abundance of genes involved in circadian regulation and host-seeking behavior. Hemoglobin intake significantly reduced post-feeding activity, increased sleep amounts, and suppressed transcription of the core circadian gene period in mosquito heads. Short periods of sleep deprivation during the post-blood feeding period of inactivity did not alter egg production, timing of deposition, or viability. Our findings reveal that hemoglobin-derived heme influences behavioral and molecular responses in Ae. aegypti after a blood meal, pointing to a complex regulatory network linking heme acquisition, oxidative stress, daily rhythms, and behavior.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Using mate removal experiments in the laboratory, we show that members of the primary caregiving sex (males) show less variation than the flexible sex (females) in their propensity to provide care, and that care propensity in females is affected by extrinsic partner cues as well as individual variability. Indeed, individual repeatability in parental effort is high in both typically caregiving and flexible parents. To investigate the underpinnings of differences in care propensity, we sequenced RNA from whole brains of caregiving and non-caregiving frogs of both sexes. While actively caregiving females showed minimal differential gene expression compared to actively caregiving males, females that failed to provide care showed distinct patterns of gene expression.

However, the impact of inherited germline variants upon the metabolic genes interaction still remains unexplored. In this work, we present a computational pipeline named A-LAVA for the detection and analysis of germline variants that affect metabolic pathways in cancer. Our pipeline enables analysis at three different levels: SNP, gene, and pathway-based analysis. The first steps consist of detecting statistically significant SNPs through standardized GWAS pipelines and, subsequently, genes associated with metabolic traits through gene-level analysis. Then, A-LAVA performs gene set analysis (GSA) to further explore the effect of detected associations on metabolic pathways. This analysis is done through a statistical model that newly corrects for the confounding effects arising from overlapping gene sets, in addition to other corrections performed by the current best practices. Our analysis conducted on TCGA data shows that SNP and gene-level results identified key associations and that A-LAVA's GSA approach improved the overall accuracy both on synthetic and real data by correctly correcting for overlapping genes, refining significance thresholds, and reducing false positives, thus leading to more reliable metabolic pathway rankings and a more robust framework for gene set analysis.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Administration of LOX inhibitor {beta}-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) in diabetic mice concomitantly blocked BM matrix stiffening and neutrophil activation (superoxide generation and gp91phox upregulation), which predictably inhibited neutrophil cytotoxicity towards co-cultured retinal endothelial cells. Further, culturing neutrophils within BM-mimicking hydrogels of tunable stiffness indicate that matrix-localized and soluble LOX act synergistically to mechanochemically activate neutrophils in the BM.

The objective of the present study was to explore the use of gene expression profiling from raw milk samples to define the inflammatory status of udder quarters. A pilot study allowed us to select 37 genes among 95 whose expression were associated with one of three milk cell types, i.e. neutrophils, macrophages or T-lymphocytes, purified by cell sorting. Based on expression data measured by RT-qPCR for these genes, we were able to identify four different types of milk samples, each with specific properties. One cluster was characterized by increased expression of genes typifying neutrophils, a second one was identified by increased expression of genes typifying macrophages while the two others were distinguished based on the expression of genes associated with T lymphocytes.

Differential expression analysis identified numerous affected proteins, with enrichment pointing to alterations in mitochondrial function and actin cytoskeletal disruption as major targets. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) highlighted Mitochondrial Dysfunction and NRF2-Mediated Oxidative Stress among top toxicological categories, and Nuclear Cytoskeletal Signaling as a key canonical pathway. To validate and extend these findings, submerged cultures of BEAS2B cells were exposed to hydroxyacetone (0.01 to 10 mg/mL) and assessed for mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress, and F-actin integrity. At 1 mg/mL, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased, with elevated hydrogen peroxide detected in the culture medium. At 10 mg/mL, mitochondrial activity declined significantly, accompanied by cell rounding and apoptotic blebbing within 2 hours. F-actin destabilization occurred at 1, 3.33, and 10 mg/mL, with cytoplasmic and perinuclear filaments more affected than cortical actin. Findings from ALI and submerged models were concordant, supporting hydroxyacetone induced mitochondrial stress, oxidative damage, and cytoskeletal disruption.

Loss-of-function mutations in GDF2 are found in heritable PAH, suggesting its function as an endothelial quiescence factor, while agonizing or antagonizing BMP9 signaling are both reported to ameliorate experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH). This study sought to resolve the contribution of BMP9 to pulmonary vascular disease and its status as a potential therapeutic target. The function of BMP9 in experimental PH was interrogated using recombinant BMP9, BMP9/BMP10 ligand trap ALK1-Fc, two anti-BMP9 neutralizing antibodies, and the activin/GDF/BMP ligand trap ACTRIIA-Fc (a.k.a., sotatercept). Disulfide-linked, prodomain complexed BMP9 was not protective in SUGEN-hypoxia or monocrotaline-induced PH models, in contrast to previous studies using incompletely disulfide-linked BMP9. In contrast, selective and non-selective BMP9 antagonism exerted prophylactic and therapeutic effects across PH models. Anti-BMP9 and ACTRIIA-Fc had comparable impact on hemodynamics, RV hypertrophy, and vascular remodeling, while single nucleus RNA-Seq revealed similar inhibition of SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3 transcriptional activity, and highly overlapping DEGs, particularly in the endothelial compartment (r=0.83, p=2.54e-43, Spearman), suggesting overlap of mechanism in targeting BMP9. A multi-omic approach using lung tissues from human PAH, experimental models of pulmonary hypertension, and transcriptomic analysis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from PAH patients revealed that BMP9 is critical for regulating several endothelial gene products that are overexpressed in human and experimental disease and implicated in disease pathogenesis including CXCL12, PDGF-BB, EDN1, COL18A1, and IGFBP4, and are inhibited by administering anti-BMP9 neutralizing antibodies or ligand traps. Co-culture studies revealed paracrine effects of BMP9-stimulated PMVEC on pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) phenotypic plasticity, which could be attributed in large part to endothelial-derived CXCL12. In summary, endothelial BMP9 signaling is a key coordinator of vasoactive endothelial gene products that modulate PASMC phenotype and appears to be a shared target of anti-BMP9 and ACTRIIA-Fc. Selective targeting of endothelial BMP9 angiogenic signaling represents a potential therapeutic strategy for human PAH.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

The adaptive pathways that distinguish benefit from pathology remain unclear. Here we reveal that longevity induced by mitochondrial Complex I/nuo-6 mutation in C. elegans is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ channel, InsP3R. We find that the InsP3R promotes mitochondrial respiration, but the mitochondrial calcium uniporter is dispensable for both respiration and lifespan extension in Complex I mutants, suggesting InsP3R action is independent of matrix Ca2+ flux. Transcriptomic profiling and imaging reveal a previously unrecognized role for the InsP3R in regulating mitochondrial scaling, where InsP3R impairment results in maladaptive hyper-expansion of dysfunctional mitochondrial networks. We reveal a conserved InsP3R signaling axis through which calmodulin and actomyosin remodeling machineries, including Arp2/3, formin FHOD-1, and MLCK, constrain mitochondrial expansion and promote longevity. Disruption of actin remodeling or autophagy mimics InsP3R loss. Conversely, driving fragmentation ameliorates mitochondrial expansion and rescues longevity, supporting a model in which InsP3R-dependent actin remodeling sustains mitochondrial turnover. These findings establish an inter-organelle signaling axis by which ER calcium release orchestrates mitochondrial-based longevity through cytoskeletal effectors.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Active translation can result in stalling and collision of ribosomes, which have negative fitness consequences. However, the ways in which chloroplasts respond to these types of translational stressors remain unknown. Here, we identify two MutS2 proteins that act as critical players in plastid ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) in Arabidopsis. We found that both MutS2A and MutS2B are required to overcome specific antibiotic-induced ribosome stalling and collisions. Further, these proteins appear to be essential for tissue greening during de-etiolation, potentially due to increased translational demand during the transition from etioplast to chloroplast. Although bacterial homologs of MutS2 have been widely recognized for their role in regulating homologous recombination, we found only weak support for this function in Arabidopsis plastids. Therefore, these proteins, which are widely conserved among photosynthetic eukaryotes, appear to be central in the resolution of ribosome collisions and may play a critical role during times of increased translational demand.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

In plants, miRNA precursors are processed from imperfect foldback structures by the RNase III enzyme DICER-LIKE1, in coordination with accessory proteins. While mismatches flanking the miRNA/miRNA* duplex in endogenous precursors can strongly influence miRNA accumulation, their impact has not been thoroughly examined in the context of artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) used for targeted gene silencing in plants. Here, using silencing sensor systems in Nicotiana benthamiana, we systematically investigated how base-pairing at or near DCL1 cleavage sites affects amiRNA production from the recently described minimal shc precursor. Independent pairing of naturally mismatched positions revealed that introducing a G-C pair immediately upstream of the mature amiRNA remarkably enhances amiRNA accumulation and silencing efficiency. This effect was further validated in Arabidopsis transgenic lines targeting endogenous genes and confirmed by deep sequencing, which revealed highly accurate processing and predominant release of the intended amiRNAs, supporting the specificity of the approach. Our findings show that a single structural modification in an amiRNA precursor can significantly enhance the efficacy of amiRNA-mediated gene silencing.

Here, by performing comparative genomics of three annual-perennial pairs of Oryza species (Oryza rufipogon/O. nivara, O. glumaepatula/O. glaberrima, and O. meyeriana/O. brachyantha), we identified 91 gene families that are present in all the perennial species but are missing in any of the annual species. Annotations and functional prediction of these gene families demonstrated that they may be associated with a battery of physiological components of perenniality, such as phenology, energy allocation, and source-sink dynamics. Furthermore, comparative co-expression analysis revealed that many of these families may also play important regulatory roles for orchestrating diverse processes that differ between perennial and annual Oryza species, including reproduction, root development, and response to environmental stimuli.

In common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD), early and sustained microglial activation has been shown to precede neuronal loss, with elevated levels of microglia-derived inflammatory mediators detected in affected brain regions. In contrast, little is known about the role of microglia in rare neurodegenerative disorders. One such disorder is {beta}-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), a common subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). BPAN shares pathological features with PD, including iron accumulation and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and is caused by mutations in the WD repeat domain 45 (WDR45) gene encoding an autophagy protein also called WIPI4. However, the pathological role of mutant WDR45 in BPAN and the possible contribution of microglia remain unresolved. We generated the first BPAN patient microglia model system using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to identify immune-related alterations and immunomodulatory signaling changes in a disease-relevant context. Integrated transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of iPSC-derived microglia from BPAN patients revealed a consistent shift from a homeostatic to a reactive, disease-associated state. Transcriptomic analysis showed disruption of core microglial pathways, including immune activation, stress response, and autophagy, consistent with a chronic pro-inflammatory phenotype. Complementary secretome analysis identified impaired lysosomal function and increased antigen presentation pathways, further supporting persistent microglial activation. Together this suggests that dysfunctional microglial states may contribute to BPAN pathogenesis. Our findings lay the groundwork for advancing immunomodulatory research in BPAN and may open new avenues for therapeutic development targeting microglial dysfunction.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We used high-spatial-resolution fMRI to investigate human whole brain and cortical layer activity in primary visual cortex (V1) linked with afterimages and perceptually matching animated images: stimuli designed to imitate the appearance of afterimages. Both afterimages and perceptually matched images engaged overlapping, widespread brain activity, particularly in visual sensory regions that follow the contralateral circuitry of the primary visual pathway. However, afterimages elicited weaker fMRI signals across many subcortical and cortical areas compared to images, except in salience network regions, where activity was enhanced for afterimages. Cortical layer-specific analyses in V1 revealed afterimages selectively engaged deep cortical layers, while images activated middle and superficial layers. In addition, we found that baseline eye measures and fMRI signals in arousal and visual networks differed depending on whether afterimages were perceived or not perceived. We argue that these results challenge the prevailing framing on the neurophysiological origins of afterimages as arising from either retinal or central neural processes. As with image perception, typical afterimages emerge by the interaction between retinal activity and central neural processing.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

This is important given that the same populations often bear the brunt of both toxicant and psychosocial stress burdens. Social impairments are a defining symptom in ASD. Previous work modeling combined prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and maternal stress (MS) in rodents has found male-biased social deficits in offspring, as well as changes to neuroimmune processes and the gut microbiome. However, the precise neural circuits on which these exposures converge to impact social behavior is unclear. Oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) are neuropeptides critical to the regulation of social behavior across species, signaling primarily at the oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) and vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) in the brain. Here, we hypothesized that OXT and/or AVP expression would be reduced in the brain following DEP/MS exposure. Following prenatal exposure to DEP/MS or the vehicle/control condition (VEH/CON), we measured maternal and offspring outcomes during the perinatal period, social and anxiety-like behavior during adolescence, OXT and AVP cell/fiber density and Oxtr and Avpr1a mRNA expression in early adulthood in several brain regions in both males and females. We observed a decrease in interaction time in DEP/MS males as compared to VEH/CON in the sociability assay and a decrease in social novelty preference in DEP/MS females as compared to VEH/CON. No effects of sex or treatment were observed on OXT or AVP cell number or fiber density in the hypothalamic regions assessed. However, numerous sex differences were observed in Oxtr and Avpr1a mRNA. Moreover, Avpr1a mRNA was significantly increased following DEP/MS exposure in the nucleus accumbens in both sexes and tended to increase in the dorsal hippocampus. Conversely, Avpr1a mRNA tended to decrease in the amygdala in both sexes following DEP/MS exposure. Together, these findings suggest that DEP/MS exposure has a stronger impact on female social behavior than previously observed. Moreover, while DEP/MS exposure does not appear to impact OXT or AVP expression in the brain, V1aR expression is modulated by DEP/MS exposure in several brain regions.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Recent evidence has identified a role for the PbN in regulating ingestion; however, little is known about how the PbN responds to solid food. Here, we recorded PbN responses to liquid taste stimuli over days/weeks, and tested whether these responses are good predictors of responses to solid foods consumed in a naturalistic way. Methods. Rats were prepared for one-photon calcium imaging by surgical implantation of a GRIN lens. PbN activity was imaged during multiple sessions spanning up to 112 days while animals licked various tastants in an experimental chamber (Lick phase). In some sessions, following the Lick phase, rats were presented with Granny Smith apples, milk chocolate and/or salted peanuts (Food phase). In one session, chocolate or peanut odor was presented during the Lick phase along with the tastants. Results. PbN cells responded to more than one taste quality with tastant-specific spatiotemporal patterns of response. While response profiles of individual PbN cells shifted over days/weeks, across-unit patterns differentiating taste quality remained relatively stable. Population responses to liquid tastants and solid foods were segregated according to the different motor patterns required for ingestion. Responses to liquid tastants were not good predictors of responses to solid foods. Importantly, PbN cells also responded to food-related odorants. Conclusions. Collectively, these results challenge the traditional view of the PbN as a simple relay for taste and instead position it as an integrative hub involved in processing gustatory, olfactory, and somatosensory information.

The disease is defined neuropathologically by accumulation of amyloid-{beta} plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of abnormal tau protein in the brain. Early neurofibrillary degeneration in the entorhinal cortex (EC) is a hallmark of AD and a critical initiating event in the hierarchical pathoanatomical progression. However, the factors triggering initial tau deposition in the EC remain unclear. We propose a novel biomechanical cascade hypothesis, positing that the unique anatomical inferomedial positioning of the EC, including proximity to the tentorial incisura (TI) and other skull base structures, renders it susceptible to very mild yet persistent age-related mechanical stress, analogous to the effects of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, triggering tau pathology. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify Entorhinal-Tentorial (EC-TI) adjacency and applied it to multimodal imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n=47). Based on this neuroanatomical contact coefficient (NCC), participants were heuristically stratified into high (n=24) and low (n=23) adjacency groups. When controlling for other risk factors, tau PET signal in the EC predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD only in the high-adjacency group (LLR p=0.009, tau PET in EC p=0.036). These findings identify EC-TI adjacency as a novel and anatomically grounded biomarker of AD progression risk. More broadly, they suggest a previously unrecognized biomechanical contribution to the initiation of tau pathology in aging and sporadic AD, opening new avenues for early detection, risk stratification, and mechanistically targeted prevention strategies.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Here we investigated the fetal development of the nasal chemosensory systems in the fossorial water vole (Arvicola scherman), a free-living arvicoline rodent with a highly subterranean lifestyle. We analyzed fetuses at embryonic days E17 and E21 (term) using classical histology, immunohistochemistry (markers: Gi2, Go, G{gamma}8, CB, CR, PGP 9.5, GAP-43, {beta}-tubulin, MAP2), and lectin histochemistry (UEA, LEA, SBA, STA, DBA). This combined approach enabled us to assess structural maturation, neuronal differentiation, and the temporal dynamics of glycoconjugate expression in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), olfactory epithelium (OE), and the main (MOB) and accessory olfactory bulbs (AOB). By E21, the MOB displayed a six-layered adult-like organization with well-defined glomeruli and interneuronal populations, whereas the AOB showed delayed morphological maturation but already exhibited selective molecular signatures in its nerve and superficial layers. Prenatally, the VNO underwent conspicuous structural differentiation, including stratification of the sensory epithelium, robust axonal fasciculation, and early development of vomeronasal glands. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed early expression of G-protein subunits and calcium-binding proteins, indicating premature pathway specification and interneuronal circuit formation. Lectin labeling provided additional insights: SBA emerged as a highly selective marker of the vomeronasal pathway; UEA highlighted early compartmentalization of vomeronasal projections; LEA showed a conserved, pan-chemosensory binding pattern across systems; and DBA, despite its lower specificity, revealed late-onset reactivity in postmitotic neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate that A. scherman exhibits a remarkably accelerated prenatal maturation of its chemosensory systems compared with laboratory rodents. This early functional readiness likely reflects adaptive pressures of a fossorial lifestyle, emphasizing the importance of incorporating wild species into developmental neurobiology to refine our understanding of mammalian chemosensory evolution.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Numerous simulation techniques have been developed, however, few of them have been directly compared, thus limiting the assessment of the accuracy and interchangeability of these methods as well as the accuracy of the quantitative techniques derived from them. In this work, we compared the accuracy and computational demands of eight previously published simulation approaches that adopt different geometries (ranging from infinite cylinders to synthetic vascular anatomical networks (VANs)), field offset calculations (analytical and Fourier-based), and water diffusion implementations (Monte Carlo and convolution-based), all of which are available in an open-source Python toolkit, BOLDs{omega}imsuite. The reference simulation approach for comparison used three-dimensional infinite cylinders, analytical field offsets, and Monte Carlo diffusion. When compared with the reference approach, most of the simulations, including two- and three-dimensional geometries, were in excellent agreement when assuming the intravascular signal contribution was small. Two commonly employed simulation approaches were notably biased; both used two-dimensional geometries with overly simplified vasculature or field offset calculations. In general, the simulated intravascular signal was the least consistent across approaches, thus potentially resulting in larger errors when the intravascular signal contribution is large. Lastly, the VAN results were in good agreement with the reference but they diverged slightly, yet systematically, from each other at smaller radii ([lsim] 3 m), primarily driven by intravascular signal differences. We conclude, therefore, that the reference approach is an attractive option for exploratory simulations in the many cases where anatomical and hemodynamic realism is not needed, balancing ease of implementation, accessibility, versatility, computational efficiency, accuracy of results, and interpretability. These findings help pave the way for a broader adoption of forward modelling of the BOLD signal and more reliable interpretations of biophysical simulations aiming to develop quantitative models of the BOLD signal.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

The presence of venous biases in VASO and BOLD (from the same acquisition) was then compared by using an established autobiographical memory task. While VASO and BOLD based activation patterns converged at macroscale, layer-specific differences emerged in the hippocampal subiculum, consistent with venous bias in the inner layers of the subiculum which can be explained by the unique two-sided venous drainage. Further, both VASO and BOLD showed sensitivity to short blocks (elaboration > construction), revealing an anterior-posterior distinction consistent with stronger involvement of the posterior hippocampus. Hippocampal cortical connectivity revealed brain circuitry between subcortical and cortical regions.

By capturing changes of neural information flow within and across the microcircuitry of the hippocampus, it can provide deeper insights into a number of neuropsychological phenomena and the early changes occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "The immune response to viral infection is a delicate balance that is easily perturbed. By perturbing this balance, immunodeficiencies are expected to influence within-host viral evolution. Indeed, the presence of immunocompromised hosts has been argued to be a source of novel viral variants in some infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. However, these arguments rest upon between-host models and the role of immunodeficiencies on within-host evolution in primary infections is poorly understood. Using a mechanistic immunological model, here we consider how different immunodeficiencies shape the orchestration of the immune response during primary infection, altering the viral fitness landscape, thus speeding and slowing the evolution of different viral mutations. We show that during acute infections, while immunodeficiencies in neutrophils and interferon speed viral evolution immediately following infection, by the time the infection is cleared, mutations are at lower frequencies than in immunocompetent hosts. In persistent infections, we show that while T cell deficiencies slow viral evolution, interleukin-6 and macrophage deficiencies speed viral evolution. Finally, we show that positive epistatic interactions arising due to the immunological response will accelerate the evolution of viral mutations affecting the ability of virions to evade different aspects of the immune response and to enter host cells.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Although autologous CAR-{beta}T cells have been employed in the treatment of several cancers, generating CAR-T cells for T cell malignancies remains challenging. The need to obtain enough healthy {beta}T cells from patients to generate CAR-{beta}T cells, combined with the problem of shared antigens such as the pan-cancer target CD38 expressed on both malignant and normal T cells, which can lead to fratricide of healthy CAR-{beta}T has hindered the application of CAR-T therapy for T-ALL. The use of allogeneic {beta}T and NK cells has also been explored for treating T-ALL. However deletion of the TCR{beta}/CD3 complex to avoid graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) for {beta}T and multiple infusions of NK cells, can increase the cost of manufacturing and logistics. In this study, we genetically engineered polyclonal gamma delta T ({gamma}{delta}T) cells as an alternative allogeneic cell source for cancer immunotherapy. {gamma}{delta}T share innate immune properties of NK cells and adaptive immunity of {beta}T cells. Generating CAR {gamma}{delta}T would allow us to minimize the cost of generating allogenic TRAC-KO CAR {beta}T cells and lower the number of infusions needed when NK cells are used. Utilizing a novel expansion protocol in combination with CRISPR/AAV gene editing, we developed CD38 knockout (CD38KO)/CD38-CAR polyclonal {gamma}{delta}T cells that target T-ALL. Our editing strategy enabled site-directed, on-target insertion of the CD38-CAR transgene into the CD38 locus, with no evidence of significant random CAR DNA integration (as commonly seen with lentiviral CAR transduction) or chromatin abnormalities resulting from CRISPR editing. This approach effectively mitigated fratricide through simultaneous CD38 disruption and CAR expression. We evaluated the edited {gamma}{delta}T cells in vitro across multiple patient-derived T-ALL samples and demonstrated the efficacy of the CD38KO/CD38-CAR {gamma}{delta}T cells against both baseline and relapsed samples. In vivo, a single injection of CD38KO/CD38-CAR {gamma}{delta}T cells without cytokine support resulted in potent anti-leukemic efficacy. Fratricide-resistant CD38KO/CD38-CAR polyclonal {gamma}{delta}T cells thus represent a promising off-the-shelf therapeutic platform.

Identifying potential molecular mimics and studying their properties is key to understanding the onset of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Previous work identified pairs of infectious epitopes (EINF) and T1DM epitopes (ET1D) that demonstrated se-quence homology; however, structural homology was not considered. Correlating sequence homology with structural properties is important for translational investigation of potential molecular mimics. This work compares sequence homology with structural homology by calculating the structures and elec-trostatic potential surfaces of the epitope pairs identified in previous work from our laboratory. Results: For each pair of EINF and ET1D, the root mean square deviations (RMSD) were calculated between their predicted structures and their electrostatic potentials. Structures were predicted using the AlphaFold software program. Of the 53 epitope pairs considered here, only 10 did not exhibit any matching (i.e. less than 3 residues overlap). When considering all residues the RMSD ranges from 0.33 [A] to 11.66 [A] with an average of 2.68 [A]. Twenty-two pairs (42%) have RMSD of less than 1.5 [A] and 30 (58%) less than 3 [A]. Conclusions: Most of the EINF/ET1D pairs selected by sequence homology show similar structural and electrostatic distributions, indicating that the EINF may also bind to the same protein targets, i.e. the major histocompatibility complex molecules, for T1DM, leading to molecular mimicry onset of the disease. These findings suggest that searching for epitope pairs using sequence homology, a much less com-putationally demanding approach, leads to strong candidates for molecular mimicry that should be considered for further study. But structure homology, electrostatic potential calculations and full docking calculations may be necessary to advance the in-silico molecular mimicry predictions, which may be useful to select the most promising candidates for experimental studies.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

A challenge for the field has been to find Muller glia markers that detect non-reactive cells or work well in non-mammalian models. We introduce two novel markers for identifying reactive and non-reactive Muller glia in vertebrate retinas: a modified enzyme lectin (GFP-EndoNDM) and a monoclonal antibody (mAb735). These markers recognize polysialic acid (polySia), which is a highly conserved glycosylation modification in humans and vertebrates. In the retina, polySia is present on Muller glia predominantly in the form of polySia-NCAM. We used GFP-EndoNDM and mAb735 to investigate polySia distribution in Muller glia of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, rodents, retinal organoids, and humans. In adult retinas of most species, polySia was localized to the Muller glia and spanned outer to inner retina, with inner plexiform layer (IPL) sublaminae ramifications. Gliosis was also detectable in degenerating murine retinas. Notable species differences were that only outer retinal regions of Muller glia were labelled in adult zebrafish, whereas the outer Muller glia body up to the first IPL sublamina was labelled in adult turquoise killifish. There was no significant retinal polySia labeling in larval zebrafish, but it was present in the brain. Larval turquoise killifish have polySia throughout the retina, similar to other adult vertebrates. Labelling polySia expands the scientific toolbox for Muller glia markers, and offers a versatile way to visualize and monitor structural changes in non-reactive and reactive Muller glia across most vertebrate species.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Integrating Escherichia coli (E. coli) testing with key environmental parameters allowed for linking resistant bacteria to pollution sources. Water samples were collected from four selected points along the river during the dry and wet seasons of 2023 and 2024. Fecal samples (non-environmental samples) were also collected from areas surrounding the river to study their impact on it. Resistance patterns of E. coli and multidrug resistance to 12 antibiotics of 11 rows were tested for 80 river water isolates and 39 non-environmental isolates by using methodological methods. E. coli showed the highest resistance to ampicillin (97.5%), followed by cefotaxime (96.25%). Importantly, multidrug resistance was recorded in 93.75% and 97.44%, of river and non-environmental isolates, respectively. The recorded values for the Antibiotic Resistance Index exceeded the threshold. Environmental parameters showed varying degrees of association with antibiotic resistance. There are few reports about ARB in Iraqi rivers due to the focus on clinical samples.

We analyzed soil nematode communities, which are important bioindicators and contributors to ecosystem processes, by assessing taxonomic and functional diversity across patch (), site ({gamma}), and between-patch ({beta}) scales using Hill-Chao numbers. Additionally, we tested whether environmental variables explain nematode diversity responses. Our results show that functional diversity is more responsive than taxonomic diversity, with increased {beta}-diversity of common and frequent taxa alongside simultaneous declines in - and {gamma}-diversity. This pattern suggests a shift toward more specialized nematode communities in response to the intervention. Moreover, we found that site-specific conditions, such as sand content and understory biomass, modulated these effects. Overall, our findings reveal complex, scale-dependent responses of nematode diversity to aboveground forest structural changes, emphasizing the need to consider environmental context in forest biodiversity management.

Through simulations and a five-month case study on an research center, we examined the effects of covariate temporal resolution, discretisation scale in discrete-time (DT) models, and interpolation methods in continuous-time (CT) models. While occupancy and abundance estimates were largely unaffected by these choices, detection estimates were more sensitive to them. DT models with fine temporal discretisation closely matched CT models. Simulations showed that when detection covariates had no effect on detectability, the considered modelling choices had little impact. But when covariates did influence detection, bias and error increased if their temporal variation was not accurately retained. The case study revealed more complex patterns, highlighting the consequences of temporally simplifying both observations and detection covariates.

While such systems often impose costs through epistatic interactions, some may behave as modular, 'plug-and-play' units that retain function with minimal disruption. We used the polysaccharide capsule locus of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a highly exchangeable and fast-evolving locus, as a model. We genetically engineered capsule exchanges (swaps) across diverse genetic backgrounds and combined transcriptomics, fitness assays, and evolution experiments, to show that capsule exchange has negligible effects on global expression and only marginal fitness costs, regardless of serotype. Adaptation to capsule-costly environments consistently reduced capsule production, regardless of serotype, revealing shared adaptive trajectories rather than serotype-specific pathways. Moreover, serotype-specific traits involved in bacterial virulence, such as biofilm formation and hypermucoviscosity, were conserved across genetic backgrounds. This reveals that capsule swapping can directly shape host-pathogen interactions and influence within-patient evolution. Our findings provide strong evidence that capsule loci display plug-and-play dynamics: they are transferable, functional across contexts, and minimally disruptive to the host genome.

NLTRs play critical mutagenic and regulatory roles during oncogenesis in humans and model species. However, it is not known whether recent nLTR activity in the genome is related to the lifetime cancer risk of a species beyond humans and conventional model organisms. We examined whether recent nLTR activity predicts cancer prevalence across mammals using comparative analyses of de novo whole-genome repeat annotations from 55 species, each with over 20 published zoo pathology records. We quantified nLTR activity as the number of potentially active elements, their proximity to protein-coding genes and cancer gene orthologs (CGOs), and insertions within these genes. Across all three metrics, neoplasia prevalence was associated with both L1 and combined L1-SINE activity, while malignancy was linked exclusively to the L1-SINE predictors. This pattern suggests a complementary and escalating trajectory, where L1s contribute to early tumorigenic events, while SINE activity, driven by L1s, amplifies their impact and fuels the transition to malignancy. Moreover, genomes harboring more CGOs tended to exhibit higher neoplasia prevalence, and the number of fusion cancer genes was strongly correlated with the number of potentially active L1s across species. Our results further revealed a pattern wherein species with minimal cancer prevalence exhibit restricted activity of at least one major nLTR superfamily, suggesting that preserving genome stability through limited retrotransposition may serve as a protective mechanism against cancer.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Real-time 3D tracking of the rat and the reward gantry enables closed-loop control of maze topology, cue configuration, and reward delivery. All subsystems are controlled using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework via a custom Python-based user interface. The Omniroute can reproduce classic behavioral mazes and a variety of novel configurations to test hypotheses on the interactions between routes, cues, and behavior. Automated configuration, tracking, and reward delivery enable high-throughput experiments on complex navigation behaviors without the potential biases introduced by direct experimenter intervention. Designed from the ground up for robust operation, the Omniroute system utilizes affordable hardware and software to facilitate easy fabrication and assembly as well as replicability by other researchers.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Background Ultrasonic monitoring is essential for ecological studies of bats and other animals, yet high-performance field devices remain prohibitively expensive and inaccessible--particularly in biodiversity-rich regions with limited research infrastructure. Existing low-cost options often lack real-time listening and require a complex setup. There remains a critical need for versatile, affordable, and field-ready tools that support acoustic behavioural research, educational and conservation outreach. 2. New Tool. I introduce Esperdyne, an open-source, dual-channel ultrasound monitoring and recording system based on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. With a component cost under {euro}75, Esperdyne combines real-time heterodyne monitoring, stereo recording from a retroactive ring buffer, and an intuitive rotary-based user interface with OLED display. It supports full-duplex 192 kHz audio, dual-band tuning for simultaneous FM/CF monitoring, and real-time playback via headphones or a speaker. All audio processing--including adjustable carrier frequency mixing, gain control, and file-saving logic--is implemented without reliance on fixed-rate audio libraries. 3. Applications. Esperdyne has been tested in field conditions and shown to reliably detect high-SNR calls and harmonics from free-flying bats. A companion MATLAB tool Bat Reviewer supports rapid inspection, playback, and export of selected recordings. Together, these tools enable portable, solo-operated acoustic surveys with minimal training. Beyond ecological research, Esperdyne is suitable for education, outreach, and preliminary field assessments in remote or resource-constrained settings. Its modular design encourages hardware customisation and firmware extension by interdisciplinary teams. 4. Availability and Implementation. Full hardware schematics, firmware, and software tools are publicly available. The system can be built using hobbyist-accessible components and standard Arduino tooling. By sharing this system openly, I aim to lower technical barriers and foster broader participation in ultrasound-based biodiversity monitoring and conservation. Esperdyne demonstrates how microcontroller-based platforms can bridge gaps between affordability, usability, and scientific capability--supporting global efforts in soundscape ecology.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

K.; Kim, S.; Hong, J.; Bae, T.; An, Y.; Sohn, C. H.; Hwang, W. C.; Park, C.-K.; Lee, S. H.; Koh, H. R.; Hur, J. K.", "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a powerful genome editing tool capable of precisely recognizing and cleaving specific DNA sequences, and has been extensively investigated as a strategy for correcting mutations associated with genetic diseases and cancer. However, when single-nucleotide mutations do not occur within or near the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, conventional CRISPR designs often fail to discriminate between mutant and wild-type alleles. To address this limitation, we developed a guide RNA (gRNA) engineering approach that introduces an intentional mismatch within the seed region of the gRNA. These near-complementary gRNAs retain strong binding affinity to the mutant sequence while significantly reducing affinity for the wild-type, thereby enabling highly specific genome editing of single-base mutations without reliance on PAM proximity. As a proof of concept, we applied this strategy to the clinically relevant G228A (-124C > T) mutation in the TERT promoter, a cancer-specific single-nucleotide mutation frequently found in glioblastomas and other tumors, that does not generate a canonical PAM sequence. Our near-complementary gRNA successfully induced selective editing of the mutant allele while sparing the wild-type sequence. Furthermore, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) analysis revealed distinct differences in binding kinetics between mutant and wild-type DNA, providing kinetic insight into the discrimination process. In conclusion, this study presents a PAM-independent CRISPR editing strategy for the precise targeting of single-nucleotide mutations and offers a molecular framework for expanding the specificity and applicability of CRISPR-based genome editing technologies.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Mutation of a conserved residue (K504E) disrupts this junction recognition and impairs resection inhibition, RPA displacement, and cooperation with Ku. cdc13-K504E cells are hypersensitive to Exo1 overexpression and accumulate non-pigmented revertant colonies during chronic growth. These white colonies exhibit faster growth, altered telomere-proximal gene expression, upregulation of metabolic pathways, and increased 4N DNA content.

The past decade's advancements in deep learning have made progress in efficient prediction of DTIs. This paper proposes a spatial attention model for predicting drug-target interactions (SAM-DTI) from labeled SMILES strings and protein sequences. SAM-DTI (i) tries to encapsulate the input features with more relevance to the biological binding of drug-target interactions, rather than models that solely extract features from individual inputs, and (ii) emphasizes giving dynamic importance to each pair of drug-target interactions. The model follows a knowledge-inspired sub-structure vocabulary to preprocess the inputs. It predicts accurate DTI values from the interactions between each SMILES sub-structure and protein substructure pair. SAM-DTI achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

In this study, we focused on the Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, which is considered one of the most ancient carbon fixation pathways and the reductive glycine (rGly) pathway, which shares several reactions with the WL pathway. The evolutionary scenario of the two carbon fixation pathways was inferred in the phylum Thermodesulfobacteriota, which includes microorganisms that operate either the WL pathway or the rGly pathway for autotrophic growth. The timing of gene gain and loss events was inferred by gene presence/absence analyses for both pathways, together with phylogenetic analyses of their key enzymes. Our results suggested that the common ancestor of Thermodesulfobacteriota possessed all genes encoding key enzymes of both pathways; formate dehydrogenase, the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex and the glycine cleavage system. Furthermore, analyses of complete gene sets for the WL and rGly pathway, together with downstream genes required for amino acid biosynthesis, supported the possibility that the common ancestor of this phylum had been capable of autotrophic growth through these carbon fixation pathways. Then, multiple lineages have lost the WL and rGly pathway genes independently during subsequent evolution. Gene replacements also occurred in the glycine cleavage system by regaining genes by horizontal gene transfer. These results suggest that carbon fixation pathways in extant organisms in the phylum Thermodesulfobacteriota arose through a combination of vertical inheritance, gene loss, and horizontal gene transfer.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Standardized taxonomic profiling reveals marked biogeographic structure: in health, lower RT communities largely represent filtered subsets of upper RT microbiota. Respiratory disease disrupts this organization, with reproducible depletion of core taxa at specific locations such as Rothia mucilaginosa and Fusobacterium pseudoperiodonticum, the latter being present in 88% of healthy sputum samples. Source-tracking analyses further support the collapse of inter-compartmental connectivity in disease and show the emergence of invasive taxa of unclear origin. Finally, prevalence-based models outperform abundance-based models in detecting disease-associated disruptions, providing greater sensitivity to shifts in community stability.

Conventional peptide-discovery pipelines rely on low-throughput experimental screening, which is both time-consuming and prohibitively expensive. Moreover, existing computational approaches for designing peptides against target proteins typically depend on the availability of high-quality structural information. Although recent structure-prediction tools such as AlphaFold3 have achieved breakthroughs in protein modeling, their accuracy for functional interfaces remains limited. The acquisition of high-resolution structures is often expensive, time-intensive, and particularly challenging for targets with dynamic conformations, further restricting the efficient development of peptide therapeutics. Additionally, current sequence-based generative methods follow a paradigm that relies on known templates, which limits the exploration of sequence space and results in generated peptides lacking diversity and novelty. To address these limitations, we propose a contrastive conditioned diffusion framework for target-specific peptide generation, referred to as PepCCD. It employs a contrastive learning strategy between proteins and peptides to extract sequence-based conditioning representations of target proteins, which serve as precise conditions to guide a pre-trained diffusion model to generate peptide sequences with the desired target specificity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark target proteins demonstrate that the peptides designed by PepCCD exhibit strong binding affinity and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity and generation efficiency", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

A challenging, yet promising prospect is the extraction of novel insights into gene-regulatory mechanisms, by probing and interpreting such gene expression models. Using a branched convolutional neural network architecture trained on promoter and terminator sequences of allopolyploid Brassica napus and the closely related model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, we show that deep learning models can successfully capture the positional binding preferences of some transcription factor families, without having been trained on transcription factor binding data. Furthermore, we show that our model did not only detect local sequence patterns, but was also able to determine their function based on their positional context. We also found that increased prediction error correlated with additional more distal or epigenetic regulatory input. On the prediction task itself, we were able to match or outperform all previously published regression models for gene expression prediction in plants. Our results demonstrate that deep learning can be used to understand the regulatory architecture of gene expression in plants.

Additionally, alignment with flow may play a crucial role in minimizing forces and regulating feeding behaviors in Hydra. However, the response to flow (particularly in the presence of gravity) has remained underexplored. Using vertically oriented microfluidic chambers, we investigated the biomechanical response of Hydra vulgaris and two additional Hydra species to fluid flow. For Hydra vulgaris, strong surface attachment was observed for all flow rates (0 - 100 mL/hr, corresponding to average velocities of 0 - 2.2 mm/s for the chambers). The experiments indicated alignment of the body column with the flow direction at high flow rates ([&ge;] 50 mL/hr). Alignment with flow was examined by quantifying the angle between the organisms (using a vector connecting head-to-foot) and the flow direction for multiple individuals (N = 9).

This exclusion is not simply due to chemokine deficiency as exogenous chemokine addition fails to restore B cell migration. Using fractionation and metabolic profiling, we identify lactate as a dominant tumor-secreted metabolite that directly impairs B cell chemotaxis by disrupting mitochondrial metabolism. In vivo, combining lactate inhibition with engineered chemokine secretion promotes cLN-derived B cell infiltration and enables TLS formation, particularly when coupled with CD40 stimulation. Transcriptomics analyses across several human cancer datasets strengthen the association between high glycolytic activity with poor B-cell infiltration in chemokine-rich tumors.

Although immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment option, clinical benefit is limited, with only around half of patients responding, even when combined with standard chemotherapeutic agents. This limited efficacy is often attributed to immunologically ''cold '' tumour microenvironments (TME), which are resistant to current immunotherapies. Addressing this challenge requires approaches that can reprogram ''cold '' TMEs into ''hot '' immune-responsive states. USP18, a negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN) signalling, suppresses immune activation by removing ISG15 from target proteins and disrupting IFNAR-STAT2 interactions. Here, we show that both genetic ablation and catalytic inactivation of USP18 enhance type I IFN signalling in TNBC cells, leading to sustained STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation. This increased IFN responsiveness promotes antigen presentation via MHC-I upregulation and increases expression of pro-apoptotic ligands such as Fas. Proteomic profiling and immunophenotyping revealed that USP18 inhibition in vivo reduces tumour growth and increases immunogenicity, accompanied by cancer-immune infiltration modulation including CD8 T cells, Th1 cells, NK cells, cDC1, and pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages. These changes reflect a shift in the TME from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory state, driven by heightened and prolonged type I IFN signalling.

Here we investigated the genetic basis of the rare In11 insensitivity phenotype found in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) landraces. Natural variation in the rapid In11-induced ethylene response corresponded with genetic variation at the locus encoding INR itself. Surprisingly, phenotypic variation corresponded with expression level of the INR receptor, rather than coding sequence variation. Promoter sequence variation across 21 accessions of Andean Phaseolus vulgaris, as well as near-isogenic lines (NILs) derived from crosses between an In11-sensitive and insensitive line, corresponded with strength of In11-induced ethylene response. Promoter alleles also corresponded with strength of activation of a luciferase reporter in the heterologous expression model, Nicotiana benthamiana, indicating that cis-element variation is sufficient to drive differences in leaf expression levels. Surprisingly, NILs encoding either WT or the lower expression inr-2 allele did not show differences in resistance to herbivory by beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), or in In11-pretreatment protection assays, suggesting that even low INR expression can still mediate effective responses against herbivores despite insensitivity to the In11 elicitor in laboratory assays. Our results demonstrate that natural variation in PRR expression can contribute to differential PAMP responses while not necessarily affecting downstream resistance phenotypes.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}
{"title": "A Wheel of Fortune: the eukaryotic cell cycle as a tetra-stable excitable system", "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.31.673322", "authors": "Dragoi, C.-M.", "abstract": "Progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle is governed by a complex biochemical network controlling the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. Dynamically, the cell cycle control network can be viewed as a multi-stable system, in which nonlinear feedback loops generate multiple stable attractors, corresponding to distinct cell cycle phases (G1, S, G2, M). Transitions between these states are typically irreversible, ensuring ordered phase progression. However, recent studies of endocycles - variants in which subsets of phases are abrogated - have prompted the development of more general regulatory models, allowing for reversible transitions or the decoupling of autonomous oscillatory modules. The current paper combines minimal ODE modelling, phase plane analysis, and bifurcation theory to demonstrate that two prior frameworks - Newton's Cradle and Latching Gate - are alternative representations of a shared architecture based on mutually regulated oscillators. Leveraging this insight, a generalized model is introduced that captures a broader spectrum of physiological endocycles than previously acknowledged. To provide an intuitive representation of the principles identified by the new model, a 'Wheel of Fortune' analogy for cell cycle dynamics is introduced.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the first human longitudinal multi-omic study of smoking cessation, evaluating 2,501 unique single or composite features from 1,094 longitudinal samples. Our comprehensive analysis, leveraging over half a million longitudinal data points, revealed a profound effect of smoking cessation on epigenetic biomarkers and microbiome features across multiple organ systems within 6 months of smoking cessation, alongside shifts in the immune and blood oxygenation system. Moreover, our multi-omic analysis provided unprecedented granularity that allows for identification of new cross-ome associations for mechanistic discovery.

Yet the design of all-optical experiments is often manual: a pre-determined stimulus pattern is applied to cells, biosensors are measured over time, and the resulting data is processed off-line. With the advent of machine learning for segmentation and tracking, it becomes possible to envision closed-loop experiments where real-time information about cells' positions and states are used to dynamically determine optogenetic stimuli to alter or control their behavior. Here, we develop PyCLM, a Python-based suite of tools to enable real-time measurement, image segmentation, and optogenetic control of thousands of cells per experiment. PyCLM is designed to be as simple for the end user as possible, and multipoint experiments can be set up that combine a wide variety of imaging, image processing, and stimulation modalities without any programming. We showcase PyCLM on diverse applications: studying the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor activity waves on epithelial tissue movement, simultaneously stimulating ~1,000 single cells to guide tissue flows, and performing real-time feedback control of cell-to-cell fluorescence heterogeneity.

D.", "abstract": "Obesity affects well over 890 million people worldwide and causes millions of deaths each year due to metabolic complications, making it a major public health challenge. It results from a chronic imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure. This balance is regulated by the central nervous system, primarily by the hypothalamus and the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). The latter integrates metabolic signals from energy stores and gastrointestinal tract and coordinates autonomic responses. While historically overshadowed by a focus on neurons, the role of glial cells in regulating energy balance is now well established. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is a well-known protein expressed by astrocytes, playing a key role in glial and neuroglial communication. We previously demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels (HCs) in the hypothalamus and the DVC led to anorexia in mice, accompanied by neuronal activation in both regions. To further investigate the role of astrocytic Cx43 within the DVC, where its expression is remarkably high, we developed a mouse model in which Cx43 expression is specifically reduced in DVC astrocytes using an RNA interference approach. The metabolic profile of these animals was assessed under standard feeding conditions as well as under a high-fat, high-sugar diet. Although reduced Cx43 expression led to modified glial (astrocytes and microglia) morphology and phenotype within the DVC, our analyses did not reveal significant changes in the animal's metabolic phenotype. This result is surprising, given the high expression of Cx43 in the DVC and the anorexigenic effect observed with pharmacological HC inhibition. These observations raise crucial questions, about potential compensatory mechanisms involving other cell types and/or alternative neuron-glia communication pathways, as well as the DVC's ability to maintain robust control of energy homeostasis.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Theoretical analysis and Bloch simulations demonstrated that the spatial location and temporal phase of PSS oscillations are primarily determined by frequency-offset, and that their spatiotemporal superposition can generate peak signals in specific regions at specific timing that closely resemble DIANA signals.

M.; Mak, J.; Fletcher, P. J.; Wheeler, A. L.", "abstract": "Attention problems are among the most common long-lasting cognitive symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and as attention is fundamental to many aspects of cognition, the effects of attentional impairment can be broad. The brain's white matter is particularly vulnerable to damage during mTBI. Damage to oligodendrocytes and myelin contributes to cognitive deficits following injury and myelin plasticity is a potential mechanism for functional recovery. The aim of this work was to assess attentional impairment following mTBI in mice and evaluate the role of newly generated oligodendrocytes in recovery. This study used the Myrf conditional knockout mouse model, in which the Myrf gene, required for oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, is deleted from OPCs following tamoxifen injection, thereby halting oligodendrogenesis. Mice were trained on the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time (5-CSRT) task before receiving tamoxifen followed by three mTBI or sham procedures. Attention was probed on the 5-CSRT with decreasing stimulus durations at four time points following injury out to 12 weeks. While no attentional impairment was observed in mice with mTBI, OPC-MyrfKO mice showed lower choice accuracy ({beta} = -2.85%, p = 0.03) and more omitted trials ({beta} = 4.09%, p = 0.02) across injury groups, time points and stimulus durations, suggesting that active oligodendrogenesis is required for sustained attention. These results suggest that this mouse model of mTBI was not severe enough to impact attention as measured by the 5-CSRT task, however myelin plasticity in adulthood may contribute to attention and complex task performance.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Existing treatments are inconsistently effective, underscoring the importance of developing accurate models of the underlying neurobiology. Although there is agreement that the extended amygdala (EA) plays a central role in orchestrating responses to threat, the respective contributions of its two major subdivisions- the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST)- remain contentious. To help adjudicate this debate, we performed a harmonized mega-analysis of fMRI data acquired from 295 adults as they completed a well-established threat-anticipation paradigm. Contrary to popular double-dissociation models, results demonstrated that the Ce responds to temporally uncertain threat and the BST responds to certain threat. In direct comparisons, the two regions showed statistically indistinguishable responses, with strong Bayesian evidence of regional equivalence. These observations underscore the need to reformulate conceptual models that posit a strict segregation of temporally certain and uncertain threat processing in the EA.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

While primate prefrontal recordings have identified various reference frames for economic choice, it remains unclear how distinct neural mechanisms support them even in similar tasks. To address this, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on two sequential economic decision-making tasks differing only in output contingencies. Analysis of RNN activity, combined with latent connectivity inference, revealed distinct regimes: commodity-based choices with attractor dynamics and order-based choices with rotational dynamics. Moreover, value and choice representations in the order-based tasks aligned with neural data from a novel experiment where reference frames were not explicitly constrained. Our results suggest that different reference frames emerge depending on task demands and engage distinct working memory and decision-making mechanisms.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Yet this effort is challenging because substance use is multi-faceted, commonly used brain network features are not optimized to capture both local and global aspects of intrinsic connectivity, and because the facets themselves sensitive to developmental shifts. In this study, we operationalized adolescent substance use along three dimensions--intent, access, and family-developmental history--and trained predictive models of each facet using resting-state connectivity. Trait impulsivity, a known risk factor, was also examined. Using Baseline and 2 Year Follow-Up data from the ABCD Bids Community Collection (ABCC), we found that prediction was more successful at follow-up than baseline. At baseline, predictive accuracy was modest and intent to use substances was the most accurately predicted facet. Prediction accuracies at follow-up were much higher, with access and family-developmental history being better predicted, signaling a developmental shift in the brain-behavior mapping of substance use vulnerabilities. These findings suggest that the neurobiological correlates of substance are dynamic across adolescence, possibly reflecting changing phenotype. More broadly, these results underscore the importance of modeling distinct substance use facets and accounting for developmental timing to understand risk trajectories, while contributing to a growing literature that shows early-developing individual differences are predictive of later outcomes.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

During the resolution phase, steroid-synthesizing predominantly basophils are enriched in the lung. Mice with immune cell-specific ablation of de novo steroidogenesis exhibit exacerbated lung injury, impaired resolution of inflammation, and defective tissue repair.

During embryonic development of the simple, sac-like lungs of anoles, the epithelium is pushed through the openings of a pulmonary smooth muscle mesh by the forces of luminal fluid pressure. This process of stress ball morphogenesis generates the faveolar epithelium typical of squamate lungs. Here, we compared embryonic lung development in brown anoles, leopard geckos, and veiled chameleons to determine if stress ball morphogenesis is conserved across squamates and to understand the physical processes that generate transitional-chambered lungs with diverticulae. We found that epithelial protrusion through the holes in a pulmonary smooth muscle mesh is conserved across squamates. Surprisingly, however, we found that luminal inflation is not conserved. Instead, leopard geckos and veiled chameleons appear to generate their faveolae via epithelial folding downstream of epithelial proliferation. We also found experimental and computational evidence suggesting that the transitional chambers and diverticulae of veiled chameleon lungs develop via apical constriction, a process known to be crucial for airway branching in the bird lung.

Umbilical cord blood (UCB) serves as a valuable source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) for transplantation, particularly for patients lacking a matched donor. However, the limited number of repopulating cells in UCB units restricts its clinical utility. Our prior studies showed that genetic deletion of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) co-factor Jarid2 in mouse multipotent progenitors (MPPs) conveyed ectopic self-renewal capacity. Here, we hypothesized that the function of human HSPCs could be enhanced through JARID2 inhibition. In this study, we demonstrate that both constitutive and transient knockdown of JARID2 increases the number and enhances the functionality of human HSPCs both in vitro and in vivo. This phenotype was distinct from inhibition of EZH2 in UCB cells, suggesting the mechanism was independent of PRC2 co-factor activity of JARID2. Mechanistically, JARID2 knockdown promotes a quiescent, long-term self-renewal gene expression program governed by upregulating STAT1 and characterized by an MHC class II immunophenotype. Analogous to mice, these mechanisms conferred HSC-like potential to human MPPs in vivo. Taken together, these findings highlight JARID2 inhibition as a novel and reversible approach to expand functional UCB-derived HSPCs ex vivo, potentially improving access to stem cell transplantation for a wider patient population.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

V.; Ashton-Butt, A.", "abstract": "Machine learning models are vital in species detection from acoustic data, due to the large amount of recordings produced, especially in passive acoustic monitoring studies. However, the acoustic environment of a site can significantly impact the detectability of species using such models, potentially leading to biased estimates of species abundance and distribution. This impact is poorly understood, and current manual validation methods for assessing acoustic detectability are intractable when working with many species, across multiple locations and datasets, due to the intensive time requirements to manually identify false negatives. We introduce a new method, Noise-Augmented Detectability Estimation (NADE), to estimate the impact of site-specific environmental noise on the acoustic detectability of different species. We use vocalisations augmented with noise from the sites themselves to alleviate the need for manual validation of detectability. Our approach produces site- and species-specific estimates of the complex relationship between background noise, vocalisation amplitude, and acoustic detectability when using a machine learning detection model. We evaluate this method using BirdNET on six bird species, in the UK, demonstrating its potential for broader application in acoustic ecology. Our results show that there are large differences in the ability of a machine learning model to detect and classify vocalisations across different sites and species. For example: the detectability of loud vocalisations can be 90\\% at one site and 10\\% at another; the detectability at a site can be halved during the course of a survey; and that the amplitude of the background noise alone is insufficient to correctly estimate the detectability of a vocalisation. Detectability at a site can also vary considerably by species: a site can have the relatively high detectability for one species but poorer detectability for another. By providing a quantitative measure of how site-specific background noise affects acoustic detectability, NADE could be used to improve the accuracy of species abundance estimates derived from passive acoustic monitoring, helping to identify sites and times where the detectability is likely to be lower. This approach provides a significant step towards making acoustic detectability estimation more feasible, allowing more robust estimates of species abundance and distribution from acoustic data.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Deadwood fungi are extremely diverse and important for carbon turnover in forests. However, how forest structure, resulting from management, affects deadwood fungal diversity and decomposition is not well known. We experimentally tested the effects of microclimate (via canopy cover) and deadwood enrichment (snags, logs, tree crowns, and habitat trees) on fungal diversity. Further, we assessed the effects of the treatments and fungal diversity on wood mass loss. We characterized the fungal communities of Fagus sylvatica (European beech) and Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) deadwood via metabarcoding and measured wood mass loss after 3 years. We found that the host tree species was more important than canopy cover or deadwood enrichment for fungal alpha and beta diversity. Fungal alpha diversity of beech was mainly related to canopy cover; diversity of beech was higher under closed canopies. While alpha diversity of pine was related only to deadwood enrichment as diversity increased where habitat trees and crowns remained. Furthermore, while mass loss of beech was significantly higher in patches where trees were removed and patches where crowns remained, pine mass loss was neither affected by canopy cover nor deadwood enrichment. Host tree diversity is more important than environmental variability as a determinant of fungal diversity, underpinning the importance of maintaining diverse hosts in forests. However, contrasting diversity and decomposition effects between beech and pine suggest the need for forest management strategies tailored to tree species to maintain fungal diversity and ecosystem processes.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We evaluated the effect of C farming practices on soil P balance, P stocks, and potential P loss through surface and subsurface runoff and erosion. Based on the results, carbon farming had only minor impacts on P loss compared with the current soil conservation practices already applied by the farms. The farmers did not utilize the opportunity to reduce P fertilization through some carbon farming practices which could improve soil P availability, therefore resulting in weak P balances. Furthermore, only a small fraction of the field area (18%) was responsible for the majority (50%) of the estimated P loss, indicating the importance of P loss hotspots.

Here we show that perturbations of different nodes of the Insulin/TOR pathway modulate the impact of nutritional variation on the growth of the eye to varying degrees, and that this is further influenced by sex. When starved, wild-type flies decrease in eye size and body size isometrically in females, yet males change eye-to-body size allometrically. Subsequently we used eye-specific RNAi to knockdown each component of the Insulin/TOR pathway to characterize the influence each component has in modulating nutritional plasticity of the sizing properties of the eye. Surprisingly, this resulted in a range of size and scaling variation, components modulating the plastic response on eye size mean, eye-to-body slope, intercept, as well as eye size variance, some effects ranging in magnitude from shutting off plasticity to amplifying, and some which were sex-limited. Therefore, components of the Insulin/TOR pathway vary in their degree and ability to influence the effect of nutritional variation on eye growth within and between sexes in terms of average size, allometry at both the level of intercept and slope, as well as the degree of variance. More generally, the morphospace and allometry of a trait can evolve within and across the sexes through modifications of plasticity genes that mediate gene-by-environment interactions.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

W.; Thomas, L.", "abstract": "There is a growing need for scalable and cost-effective genetic monitoring tools to support the management of species and populations of conservation importance, driven by the increasing biodiversity loss, need for long-term population data and limitations of invasive genetic sampling. Whale sharks, along with other Endangered, elusive and highly migratory species, spend the majority of their lives in offshore ocean waters. This behaviour poses logistical and ethical challenges to invasive genetic sampling of the species, which is traditionally done via tissue biopsy. Here, we develop a genetic toolkit to study populations of whale sharks from seawater environmental DNA using short segments of nuclear DNA (100 to 300bp) containing two or more SNPs called microhaplotypes. Amplifying these markers from seawater collected in 1L bottles behind sharks showed that we can reliably genotype sharks from water samples taken immediately behind the animal. Moreover, we observed a strong relationship between population-level allele frequencies and estimates of genetic diversity between eDNA and tissue-derived samples, demonstrating the capability of eDNA in capturing population-level genetic information with high fidelity. We also analysed a tissue dataset of 72 sharks that attended the Ningaloo Coast World Heritage Area over six-years to showcase the utility of our SNP panel to study temporal processes in these populations. Our data revealed patterns of genetic variation through time that were consistent with whole genome techniques. Contributor estimation from mock environmental samples using various combinations of tissue-derived sequence data to estimate abundance of animals in a mixed DNA sample was shown to accurately identify the number of contributors in mixtures containing upto 10 individuals, beyond which biases were too large. Our findings illustrate the viability of using microhaplotype markers from seawater eDNA as a tool to study conservation genetics of whale sharks, with the potential for broader expansion of eDNA-based genetic assessments to other marine megafauna and aquatic species.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

To gain deeper insight and understanding of the P. hordei genome, we generated such assemblies for two Australian isolates with contrasting virulence, one collected in the 1970s and one in 2001. The two haplotype-phased and chromosome-level assemblies were used to investigate genome architecture in P. hordei and to investigate variability and evolutionary relationships of 41 virulence-divergent isolates that were collected over a 54-year period (1966-2020) in Australia. We report, for the first time in a rust fungus, evidence of a conserved chromosome, chromosome 9, which is enriched for structural variation and accessory features that imply it functions as a compartmentalized core chromosome with regions subject to rapid diversification, potentially acting as a structural hotspot in adaptive evolution in P. hordei. Clear genetic stratification into clonal and recombining lineages was uncovered, with evidence of both long-term asexual propagation and recombination. Analyses of haplotype-resolved mating-type gene phylogenies and chromosome 9 k-mer profiles confirm divergence at key loci underpinning reproductive modes, distinguishing clonally derived from sexually recombined groups. We also identified pervasive copy number variation across the P. hordei genomes, with clonal lineage-specific duplications. Consistent with this finding, the study for the first time links copy number variation of the Cyp51 gene to fungicide insensitivity. This latter discovery is highly significant as it represents the first documented case of fungicide insensitivity in a rust pathogen in which an underlying genetic mechanism has been identified. Together, these findings illuminate how genome structure, recombination, and structural variation shape the evolution and adaptation of P. hordei, providing a guidance for future surveillance and management of this pathogen.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

These findings contribute to establishing a general framework for filtering of genetically related sub-communities or paired samples, while preserving maximal statistical power.

Dps binds DNA and oxidises iron, facilitating survival in harsh environments. Dps-DNA complexes can form crystalline structures, leading to the proposed model that Dps reorganises the starved E. coli nucleoid into a compact liquid crystal, slowing chromosome dynamics and limiting access of other proteins to DNA. In this work, we directly tested this model using live-cell super-resolution microscopy and Hi-C analysis. We found that after 96 h of starvation, Dps compacts the nucleoid and increases short-range DNA-DNA interactions, but does not affect chromosome accessibility to large protein nanocages or small restriction enzymes. We also report that chromosome dynamics and organisation are primarily impacted by the bacterial growth phase; the effect of Dps is relatively minor. Our work clarifies the role of Dps in modulating nucleoid properties, and we propose an updated model for Dps-DNA interactions in which Dps binds, protects and compacts DNA largely without influencing chromosome access, dynamics and organisation.

The distinction of diverse dynamical patterns in time series data holds significant biochemical and biophysical implications, as these patterns are intimately related to physiological cellular states associated with health and disease. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework based on a large kernel convolutional neural network (LKCNN) for the classification of dynamical states of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. We use a chemical Langevin equation to generate synthetic data for training the LKCNN, simulating intracellular Ca2+ concentration patterns mimicking real experimental traces. We show that the LKCNN framework reliably classifies diverse intracellular Ca2+ dynamical regimes, achieving near 90% accuracy across all dynamical states. To this end, we propose an optimized kernel size for the LKCNN classifier, which captures both short-lived fluctuations and long-range correlations. While steady states, bursting, and simple oscillations are robustly distinguished with near-perfect accuracy, the performance slightly degrades for chaotic and multiple periodicity states under realistic levels of intrinsic fluctuations, reflecting genuine overlap in their temporal signatures. We validate our classifier with experimental Ca2+ concentration data, showing strong agreement with manual labeling and confirming generalizability beyond synthetic datasets. These results establish LKCNNs as flexible and scalable tools for systematic classification of cellular dynamics, with broad potential applications to other oscillatory biological processes.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Many of the benefits of protein restriction are mediated by reduced consumption of dietary branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; leucine, valine and isoleucine), and restriction of the BCAAs is sufficient to extend healthspan and lifespan in mice. While the BCAAs have often been considered as a group, it has become apparent that they have distinct metabolic roles, and we recently found that restriction of isoleucine is sufficient to extend the healthspan and lifespan of male and female mice. Here, we test the effect of lifelong restriction of the BCAA valine on healthy aging. We find that valine restriction (Val-R) improves metabolic health in C57BL/6J mice, promoting leanness and glycemic control in both sexes. To investigate the molecular mechanisms engaged by Val-R with aging, we conducted multi-tissue transcriptional profiling and gene network analysis. While Val-R had a significantly greater molecular impact in the liver, muscle, and brown adipose tissue of female mice than males, there was a stronger gene enrichment with phenotypic traits in male mice. Further, we found that phenotypic changes are associated with a multi-tissue downregulation of the longevity associated PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Val-R reduces frailty in both sexes and extends the lifespan of male by 23%, but does not extend female lifespan, corresponding with a male-specific downregulation of PI3K-Akt signaling. Our results demonstrate that Val-R improves multiple aspects of healthspan in mice of both sexes and extends lifespan in males, suggests that interventions that mimic Val-R may have translational potential for aging and age-related diseases.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

A widely used framework for describing temperature dependence is the Arrhenius equation, which predicts an exponential increase in rates with temperature. However, biological rates often deviate from this prediction when measured across broader temperature ranges. While negative apparent activation energies are often attributed to protein denaturation, this cannot explain similar behavior observed at temperatures where enzymes remain stable. These broader scaling patterns remain mechanistically unexplained. Here we present a general Markov chain framework for modeling biological timing as cascades of reversible, temperature-dependent steps. Applying this model to 121 published datasets spanning diverse species, biological timescales, and temperature ranges, we find that a consistent three-zone scaling pattern emerges: Arrhenius-like behavior at low and high temperatures, and a quadratic exponential regime at intermediate temperatures. We show that this pattern arises naturally from differences in activation energies across steps in the network. The quadratic exponential regime is an emergent feature of averaging across many steps and is robust to variation across network realizations. In contrast, Arrhenius-like scaling at the extremes tends to be more variable and originates from smaller sub-networks. Apparent negative activation energies can emerge naturally from the dynamics of multi-step networks, even in the absence of protein denaturation. Our framework provides a unified mechanistic explanation for diverse temperature-scaling behaviors in biology and may help predict how developmental and physiological processes respond to environmental change. Although we focus on development, the model is broadly applicable to biological systems governed by multi-step reaction networks.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the role of IRF8 in anxiety disorders in the mouse model. IRF8 is a transcription factor expressed primarily in microglia in the brain. A battery of behavioral tests revealed that female IRF8 knockout (IRF8KO) mice show increased anxiety relative to male IRF8KO and wild-type mice. Female IRF8KO mice also exhibited a higher tendency for obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, these behavioral abnormalities were not observed when IRF8 was deleted postnatally, indicating that it acts during the fetal stage to control anxiety. Transcriptome analysis revealed that IRF8 deficiency leads to redox dysregulation. Further, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) staining for microglia demonstrated that female IRF8KO microglia produce higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to WT and male IRF8KO counterparts. Detailed RNA-seq analysis, however, did not reveal specific genes that cause high ROS production in female cells.

Despite their potential, current MCS (e.g., cromolyn sodium, Tranilast, nedocromil) in clinical use are hindered by poor bioavailability, frequent dosing, long lags to onset of relief, and enigmatic mechanisms of action. MCS have their origins in phytomedicine: cromolyn sodium is the longest standing drug in the class and is a derivatized form of Khellin from Ammi visnaga, used as an anti-inflammatory.

At 5 h post-infection, the Lp type IV secretion system (T4SS) and the S.Tm SPI-1 T3SS were required for the early drop of the oxygen consumption rate. Despite reduced respiration, the {Delta}{psi}m was preserved in all infection conditions and pathogen-specific strategies to maintain the {Delta}{psi}m were revealed. While Lp infection modulates the FOF1-ATPase to function in the reverse mode (hydrolase) with the adenine-nucleotide translocator (ANT) remaining in forward mode, S.Tm does not reverse the FOF1-ATPase during infection. Systematic inhibition of ETC complexes established that Complex I is uniquely required to maintain the {Delta}{psi}m during infection with virulent bacteria but not with secretion-deficient mutant strains. Complex II is required in all infection conditions but its inhibition had a minimal effect in non-infected cells, indicating infection-driven participation of this complex in the electron flow in the ETC coupled with the preservation of the {Delta}{psi}m.

This process, termed natural transformation, facilitates the horizontal acquisition of genetic material, potentially conferring adaptive advantages that enhance bacterial survival under selective pressures. To make homologous DNA available in the surrounding environment, Streptococcus pneumoniae expresses a cell wall hydrolase (CbpD) that lyses and kills closely related species. This process has been coined fratricide, and the acting hydrolase a fratricin. A significant fraction of streptococcal species does not encode a CbpD-like protein, but another competence-induced peptidoglycan hydrolase LytF. It has been speculated that LytF serves the same purpose as CbpD, however, our investigations into the role of LytF in Streptococcus sanguinis revealed no evidence supporting LytF as a fratricin. Instead, we show that LytF is involved in natural transformation by promoting DNA uptake. An essential part of DNA uptake is the competence-induced type IV pilus, which facilitates DNA uptake by pulling nearby DNA toward the cell. By immunoblotting and microscopy imaging, we found that LytF increases the extracellular levels of the major pilus component ComGC, suggesting that LytF may modify peptidoglycan to promote pilus extrusion across the cell wall, thereby enhancing the efficiency of DNA uptake.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

To further elucidate this role of ClpX, we constructed a conditional clpX strain, in which clpX induction is decoupled from its native transcriptional control. This conditional expression system mimicked a clpX-deficient phenotype under non-inducing conditions and restored the wild-type phenotype upon induction. Our results indicate that the full induction of the CtsR regulon, particularly clpE, requires both heat and the presence of ClpX, thereby extending the current model for the transcriptional activation of genes repressed by CtsR.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Advances in sequencing technologies and high-performance computing have enabled the analysis of large-scale metagenomic data, facilitating the use of machine learning to predict disease likelihood from microbiome profiles. However, challenges such as compositionality, high dimensionality, sparsity, and limited sample sizes have hindered the development of actionable models. One strategy to improve these models is by incorporating key metadata from both the host and sample collection/processing protocols. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based pipeline for predicting human disease states by integrating host and protocol metadata with microbiome abundance profiles from 68 different studies, processed through a common pipeline. Our findings indicate that metadata can enhance machine learning predictions, particularly at higher taxonomic ranks like Kingdom and Phylum, though this effect diminishes at lower ranks. Our study leverages a large collection of microbiome datasets comprising of 11,208 samples, therefore enhancing the robustness and statistical confidence of our findings. This work is a critical step toward utilizing microbiome and metadata for predicting diseases such as gastrointestinal infections, diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

The Negative Regulatory Region (NRR) of the extracellular domain (ECD) and the PEST region of the intracellular domain (ICD) are mutation hot spots which can act synergistically in T-ALL. The NRR, comprised of a Heterodimerisation Domain (HD) and three Lin12/Notch repeats (LNR A-C), masks the S2 cleavage site, normally only exposed following ligand binding and cleaved as the first step that ultimately leads to ICD release. Drosophila mutants have played a key role in analysing Notch structure/function but there have been few mutational studies of the NRR. Here we expressed, in S2 cells, over 20 cancer mutations located in the HD, LNR and LNR/HD interface, introduced into Drosophila Notch. Mutations in the HD domain core did not activate, likely due to absence, in Drosophila, of an S1 cleavage within the HD, required for mammalian Notch activity. In contrast, mutations in the LNR/HD interface behaved similarly to T-ALL, activating constitutively with no further ligand-induction and were synergistic with PEST deletion. Mutations of surfaced-exposed residues of LNR-C, also activated constitutively but remained inducible both by ligand and by an intracellular endocytic regulator, Deltex, and were not synergistic with PEST deletions. These mutations caused elevated Notch levels and decreased turnover, suggesting a novel regulatory mechanism. Our results therefore uncover a variety of outcomes arising from perturbations of the NRR and will facilitate the establishment of Drosophila cancer models and the development of mutant-specific approaches to effective therapies.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Here we quantify bigeographical variation in global patterns of burned area in protected areas. During the twenty-first century, wildfires have burned 2 billion hectares of protected areas and, while protected areas only cover 19.2% of semi-natural ecosystems, they concentrate 28.5% of the area burned annually. Wildfire in protected areas increased significantly between 2001-2024 (+0.46% yr-1), even after taking into account increases in protected area (+0.27% yr-1), pointing to a disproportional impact of fire on protected areas under increasingly severe fire weather. This pattern showed marked variation across biomes, with the largest disproportionate increases occurring in fire-prone biomes (e.g. Mediterranean and dry tropical forests, tropical grasslands and xeric shrublands). There were important exceptions to this general trend, and protected area fire was lower than expected in biomes where fire activity is naturally limited by moisture (e.g. tropical rainforests or montane grasslands). Wildfires are important for the health of many ecosystems, and such values of burned area will not always mean a negative outcome.

However, it is unclear how effectively increased GPP propagates along the 'carbon (C) cascade' to increase net primary production (NPP) and vegetation C stocks (Cveg) in different plant compartments. Vegetation models simulate divergent C cycle projections and have been criticised for being overly photosynthesis (source)-driven, neglecting processes that may lead to non-linear behaviour in response to the GPP increase, attenuating (or amplifying) changes in NPP and vegetation C stocks. Here, we introduce an analytical framework to diagnose linearity (L) of the land C cycle as the ratio of relative changes in linked fluxes and pools and apply it to outputs from 16 models of the TRENDY v11 ensemble. We found widely varying patterns in L across models and for the different links. Six models showed a clear dominance of larger relative changes in NPP than in GPP in global simulations (LNPP:GPP >1 for >60% of gridcells), indicating reduced autotrophic respiration under eCO2. Only three models had LNPP:GPP < 1 for >60% of gridcells. Four models showed a clear dominance of larger relative changes in steady-state Cveg than in NPP, while five models showed an opposite pattern - in both cases with a large spread of LCveg*:NPP across gridcells within models. Three models showed a clear dominance of larger relative changes in root C than in Cveg, while two models showed a clear dominance of the opposite pattern. Widely differing distributions of L across models and links reveal a strong influence of alternative process representations (nonlinear behaviour) in individual models. However, for all links, L deviations from 1 were roughly balanced across the model ensemble, leading to an overall linear behaviour of terrestrial C cycle representations.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Remote sensing technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) now enable the 3D mapping of entire landscapes.

To address this challenge, we developed the Global Canopy Atlas (GCA): 3,458 standardized and analysis-ready maps of canopy height and elevation at 1 m2 resolution derived from high-resolution ALS acquisitions. The GCA covers 56,554 km2 across all major biomes. Of its acquisitions 19% of have been scanned multiple times and 87% are publicly available, covering 95% of the total area. To showcase its wide range of applications, we applied the GCA in three case studies. First, we validated three global satellite-derived canopy height maps, finding poor performance at native resolution (1-30 m, R2 < 0.38) and moderate performance at 250 m resolution (R2 < 0.65). Second, analyzing global patterns in canopy gap size frequency we discovered an unexpectedly large variation of power law exponents from branch to stand level ( = 1.52 to 2.38), pointing to fundamental scale-dependencies of forest structure. Third, we developed a framework to standardize forest turnover quantification from multi-temporal ALS. Applied to repeat acquisitions in a temperate forest in North America, it revealed that 21% of canopy gaps closed within 12 years of opening and would thus be missed by infrequent monitoring.

In insects, cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are an excellent example of such traits, providing protection against different micro-climatic conditions while simultaneously encoding cues predominantly used in sexual signaling. The fatty acid synthase (fas) gene family has been implied as an important cornerstone in initiating and maintaining CHC functionality, whereas their exact biosynthetic and regulatory mechanisms have remained poorly understood. Here, we characterize a single fatty acid synthase gene (fas3) impacting the main CHC functions in the parasitoid wasp model organism Nasonia vitripennis. Knockdown of fas3 significantly decreases wasp survival under desiccation stress while also completely depleting sexual attractiveness of female wasps, where this trait naturally functions as sex pheromone. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that fas3 regulates other fas and CHC-associated genes, as well as key biosynthetic pathway hubs. We also identified striking sex-specific expression differences in fas3 across individual developmental stages, suggesting divergent functional roles of this gene in males and females. These findings largely advance our knowledge on the multi-functionality of fas genes in governing survival and sexual signaling and underscore their relevance for future studies on metabolomics, ecological adaptation, and sexual communication.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Missing data were addressed through multiple imputation followed by causal estimation using DirectLiNGAM, a direct method for estimating LiNGAM. DirectLiNGAM identified correct causal directions with high statistical reliabilities in three of four bivariate dose-response cases, even when assumptions such as linearity and non-Gaussianity were partially violated.

Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with graph-theory and centrality analyses to dissect the principles of PAM recognition in three Cas9 variants - VQR, VRER, and EQR - that target non-canonical PAMs. We show that efficient recognition is not dictated solely by direct contacts between PAM-interacting residues and DNA, but also by a distal network that stabilizes the PAM-binding domain and preserves long-range communication with REC3, a hub that relays signals to the HNH nuclease. A key role emerges for the D1135V/E substitution, which enables stable DNA binding by K1107 and preserves key DNA phosphate locking interactions via S1109, securing stable PAM engagement. In contrast, variants carrying only R-to-Q substitutions at PAM-contacting residues, though predicted to enhance adenine recognition, destabilize the PAM-binding cleft, perturb REC3 dynamics, and disrupt allosteric coupling to HNH. Together, these findings establish that PAM recognition requires local stabilization, distal coupling, and entropic tuning, rather than a simple consequence of base-specific contacts. This framework provides guiding principles for engineering Cas9 variants with expanded PAM compatibility and improved editing efficiency.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

In the first steps of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, the Cas9 protein, in complex with RNA, facilitates DNA melting and subsequent RNA-DNA hybrid formation, but the atomic-level mechanism of this fundamental process is not fully understood. Here, we present the results of long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations in which Cas9-RNA complexes bound to double-helical DNA and promoted the formation of RNA-DNA base pairs in a unidirectional, stepwise manner. Unexpectedly, we observed a direct role for the RNA in facilitating DNA melting events through a mechanism in which RNA bases intercalated within the DNA and promoted strand separation. In addition, breathing motions within the Cas9 DNA-binding cleft contributed to the sequential formation of RNA-DNA base pairs. These simulation results, obtained for two structurally distinct Cas9 proteins, together with supporting experimental work, suggest a novel RNA-dependent mechanism for DNA melting that may be conserved in other Cas proteins.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Stomatin has been reported to associate with a variety of proteins involved in diverse physiological processes, including ion channel regulation, membrane fusion, mechanosensory regulation and vesicle trafficking; however, the mechanisms by which it modulates these interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of stomatin, revealing its hexadecameric assemblies. The SPFH1 domains insert into the cytosolic leaflet of membranes and, together with the N-terminal hairpin, form a potential cholesterol-binding pocket. Liposome reconstitution experiments demonstrated that stomatin self-organizes into clusters, and Spectrum and Polarization Optical Tomography (SPOT) further showed that these clusters enhance membrane lipid order, supporting the proposed role of stomatin in organizing functional membrane microdomains (FMMs). Proteomic mass spectrometry analysis identified numerous stomatin-associated cargo proteins, including solute carrier (SLC) transporters, RAB GTPases, and integrins, suggesting that stomatin regulates solute transport and contributes to vesicle trafficking and cell migration. Together, these findings elucidate the structural and functional roles of stomatin and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for modulating cancer cell migration and metastasis.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we generated collagen-rich extra-cellular matrix (ECM) from primary dermal fibroblasts of a healthy donor (WT) and from two OI patients carrying distinct glycine mutations: G610C, associated with moderate disease, and G907D, linked to perinatal lethality. Comparative biophysical studies reveal that both mutants retain the canonical D-banding of collagen I fibrils but differ markedly at the nanoscale. G907D fibrils exhibit greater local structural perturbations and increased molecular mobility relative to the non-lethal G610C. Importantly, integrin binding also diverges between mutants: G610C displays reduced affinity, whereas G907D exhibits enhanced affinity compared to WT.

While ACTL6A is emerging as an oncogene, its role as a treatment target and mechanisms of transcription factor induction remain unknown. Here, we show that ACTL6A expression is a mediator of the Warburg effect, with ACTL6A knockdown inducing mitochondrial dependency and significantly decreasing levels of aerobic glycolysis. These effects lead to near complete attenuation of hypoxic cell growth by blunting induction of HIF1 and HIF2 protein expression. They also sensitize treatment resistant HNSCC cells to the tumor killing effects of the complex I inhibitor IACS-010759 in vivo. Using ATAC-seq, we identify ACTL6A as a mediator of chromatin accessibility of AP-1 transcription factor sites and find that it regulates upstream MAPK signaling through induction Ras and Galectin-1. These effects sensitize ACTL6A over-expressing cells to inhibition of glycolysis by MEK inhibitors. Our results link SWI/SNF subunit amplification with potentiation of MAPK signaling in HNSCC and provide a novel mechanism by which cancer cells drive aerobic glycolysis and reduce mitochondrial dependency.

In this study, a cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced POF rat model was used to evaluate the protective effects of ergothioneine (EGT) and a nutraceutical formula (FineNutri Cellular Vitality Capsules) containing EGT. CTX treatment markedly prolonged the estrous cycle, reduced estrus duration, decreased ovarian weight, impaired follicular development, and increased granulosa cell apoptosis. Serum estradiol (E2) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels decreased, whereas luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) increased, reflecting disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis by CTX. CTX treatment induced oxidative stress, with reduced catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and glutathione (GSH) content, and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) in ovarian tissue. The EGT and the nutraceutical formula restored estrous cycles, increased ovarian weight, improved primordial follicle counts, and reduced atretic follicles and granulosa cell apoptosis. Hormonal balance was partially restored, with increased E2 and AMH and reduced LH and FSH levels. Oxidative stress was alleviated with higher CAT, SOD, and GSH levels and reduced MDA concentrations. In addition, EGT and the formula reduced inflammation in skin tissue. These findings suggest that EGT and the nutraceutical formula could protect against CTX-induced POF and help preserve ovarian function, probably by mitigating oxidative stress.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

We investigated how natural variation in the Brachypodium distachyon stress response shapes root system architecture by modulating cell wall dynamics. Methods: We used root tip excision to synchronize lateral root development across natural accessions. The resulting phenotypes were analysed using comparative transcriptomics, biochemical lignin quantification, confocal Raman spectroscopy, and chemical inhibition of lignin biosynthesis. Key Results: Two distinct root system architectures, 'pine tree' and 'fishbone', were identified. The 'fishbone' phenotype results from an emergence-specific defect caused by the premature and intense lignification of the exodermis. This was driven by the transcriptional upregulation of lignin biosynthesis genes and was rescued by a lignin inhibitor. Main Conclusion: Stress-induced exodermal lignification acts as a mechanical 'brake' on lateral root emergence.

In previous work, we have established K. marxianus Y-1190 as a host for lactose valorization based on its high growth rate on lactose and its tolerance for acid conditions. Here, we establish a trifunctional genome-wide library for K. marxianus using CRISPR activation, interference, and deletion to allow identification of gene expression perturbations that enhance tolerance to fumaric acid. We determined that deletion of ATP7, encoding a subunit of the mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase, and overexpression of QDR2 and QDR3, two previously uncharacterized members of the 12-spanner H antiporter (DHA1) family in K. marxianus, can enhance fumaric acid tolerance. We also found that integrated overexpression of both QDR2 and QDR3 in a {Delta}FUM1 background strain improved titers of fumaric acid production from 0.26 g L-1 to 2.16 g L-1.

The prevailing view is that breakdown of the blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barriers contributes to neurodegeneration. Here, we reveal that selective and early vulnerability of peripheral nerve endothelium --manifested as endothelial cell activation and interlinked blood-nerve barrier dysfunction-- constitutes a core feature of ALS pathogenesis, arising before vascular alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) and motor neuron pathology. Vascular changes in ALS patients have been largely studied in postmortem samples, limiting insight into their onset, causes, and pathogenic role. Surveying diagnostic motor nerve samples from ALS patients across clinical stages, we observed endothelial damage that preceded axonal loss and demyelination, marking vascular dysfunction as an early disease event. Similar ultrastructural abnormalities were detected in pre-symptomatic ALS mouse models (SOD1 and TARDBP mutants). Notably, endothelial cells became dysfunctional even when not carrying mutant TDP-43, indicating they respond to non-cell autonomous disease signals. Transcriptional, histological, and functional analyses revealed that these alterations were largely confined to peripheral nerves, while spinal cord vessels exhibited delayed and more focal changes. Single-cell sequencing identified ALS-susceptible endothelial cell subsets prone to a pro-inflammatory phenotype and impaired blood-nerve barrier function, increasing permeability via the transcellular route. These changes coincided with reactivity of nerve-resident macrophages and neutrophil infiltration. Neutrophil depletion attenuated endothelial activation and barrier leakiness, mitigating axonopathy in ALS mice. Our work unmasks the greater susceptibility of the peripheral nerve vasculature in ALS relative to the CNS. The early activation of peripheral nerve endothelium, combined with its potential reversibility, identifies a therapeutic window and suggests strategies for targeting the vascular-immune axis to protect the motor system.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

While satiation engages a large neural network across brain regions, how the communication within this network depends on metabolic fluctuations is unclear. This study shows that nutrient access can affect neuron-to-neuron communication in this network by regulating excitatory synaptic plasticity through O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in CaMKII satiation neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Using cell-specific knockout mice and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that OGT deletion in PVNCaMKII neurons increases input resistance and neuronal excitability while preserving basic membrane electrical properties. Strikingly, feeding triggered a robust 3.8-fold increase in the excitatory synaptic input in wild-type neurons, whereas OGT-knockout neurons failed to exhibit this feeding-induced synaptic activation, instead displayed a paradoxical trend towards increases in synaptic activity during hungry conditions. Furthermore, OGT deletion destabilized glucose-dependent synaptic responses, with knockout neurons displaying maladaptive depression of excitatory transmission in conditions where stability is normally preserved. These findings establish OGT as a nutrient-sensitive modulator of synaptic plasticity that ensures appropriate satiation signalling by coupling metabolic state to synaptic plasticity.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Widefield imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes was used to track sleep-dependent brain rhythms. Multiphoton microscopy allowed assessments of amyloid plaque load and basal neuronal calcium levels. Behavioral assays were used to measure memory and cognitive function. RESULTS: Zolpidem restored NREM sleep and rescued sleep-dependent brain rhythm, slow oscillation. Zolpidem administration reduced cortical amyloid plaque burden, mitigated neuronal calcium overload, and enhanced sleep-dependent memory consolidation without adverse effects on locomotion.

The autoantibodies are directed against neuromuscular junction (NMJ) proteins such as the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), essential for neuromuscular signal transmission. Anti-AChR antibodies are mainly of the immunoglobulin (Ig) types IgG1 and IgG3, which have a high capacity to activate the classical complement pathway. In AChR-MG, complement activation and the subsequent formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) at the NMJ is one of the key effector mechanisms, causing substantial damage to the entire postsynaptic membrane and resulting in the typical clinical manifestations of muscle weakness and fatigue observed in both patients and animal models. Since classical treatment strategies, which focus on general immunosuppression and enhancing the effect of ACh binding to the AChR, do not lead to full remission of symptoms in many cases, new treatment approaches are focusing more specifically on targeting effector mechanisms, such as complement activation. The first complement inhibitor approved for MG was eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting C5. However, clinical trials showed that up to 28% of patients treated with eculizumab did not experience an improvement in myasthenic symptoms, emphasizing the urgent need for alternative therapies. Intervening earlier in the complement cascade might be more beneficial, as it could prevent the release of anaphylatoxins, such as C3a, that contribute to further inflammation at the NMJ. In this study, the passive transfer myasthenia gravis (PTMG) rat model was used to investigate whether silencing hepatic C3 expression with a C3-targeted, small interfering (si)RNA, could ameliorate disease symptoms in the acute phase of MG. Female Lewis rats were injected subcutaneously with different dosages of C3-siRNA prior to PTMG induction with mAb35. C3-siRNA, administered weekly at a dose of 30 mg/kg, significantly prevented weight and AChR loss, and accordingly improved muscle function, as measured by muscle strength tests and electromyography. Consistently, the treatment reduced MAC deposition at the NMJ. Overall, these results provide insight into the efficacy of complement inhibitors in the acute phase of MG and suggest potential strategies for advanced treatment options in AChR-MG crisis.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

In this study, we employed an in vitro medium representative of the nutritional environment of the CF colon to test the role of factors including mucin, fat, bile, pH, antibiotics and features associated with inflammation (e.g., nitrate, sulfate, formate, reactive oxygen species) on growth of clinical isolates of E. coli and Bacteroides spp. We further examined interactions between these two microbes under CF-like conditions to understand modulators of microbial competition, and identified glycerol, a surrogate of increased fat, as a significant driver of altered microbial competition. Finally, we investigated genetic determinants influencing these microbial interactions, with the focus on glycerol metabolism, by performing a transposon mutagenesis screen in E. coli. Results of this screen pointed to the role of colibactin production in mediating this microbial competition; colibactin is a DNA-damaging genotoxin associated with the increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in CF populations.

Like other diderm bacteria, C. crescentus can acquire Fe(III) via outer-membrane TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) that recognize and import ferric siderophore complexes. Although C. crescentus is not known to synthesize siderophores, it encodes multiple TBDTs that are transcriptionally regulated by the ferric uptake repressor (Fur), suggesting it acquires iron by scavenging xenosiderophores produced by neighboring microbes. To identify C. crescentus genes required for xenosiderophore utilization, we developed a barcoded transposon screen using ferrioxamine B (FXB), a hydroxamate-family siderophore produced by soil actinomycetes, as a model substrate. This screen identified hiuABC, a conserved, Fur-regulated operon that supports FXB-dependent iron acquisition. We provide evidence that hiuA encodes the primary TBDT responsible for uptake of ferrioxamines and ferrichrome (FC), structurally distinct members of the hydroxamate siderophore family. hiuB encodes a PepSY-domain protein with structural similarity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa FoxB, a known periplasmic ferri-siderophore reductase. hiuC encodes a small, hypothetical membrane protein predicted to form a functional complex with HiuB in the inner membrane. Both hiuB and hiuC are required for utilization of FXB and ferrioxamine E (FXE), indicating a shared role in iron acquisition from ferrioxamines. Surprisingly, utilization of FC as an iron source required hiuB but not hiuC, suggesting a substrate-specific role for HiuC in ferri-siderophore processing.

These transitions resemble alternating Y-{Delta} transformation-node release and release-and-straighten events, familiar from electrical networks. Burgers circuits show that passage through intermediates does not reduce the distortion in the nest, and all transitions conserve topological charge, thereby explaining the coupling of non-hexagonal cells. These dynamics propagate defect motion only to a finite extent, after which the defect stabilizes without global reorganization or functional gain. Our findings demonstrate that social insect nest building naturally realizes dynamic topological processes, shaped by material properties, construction rules, and geometric constraints.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

The oldest of these occurred ~100 million years ago (mya) and is shared by ~60 extant Saccharomycetales species, including the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Notably, this is the only known ancient WGD in the yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. The dearth of ancient WGD events in fungi remains a mystery. Some studies have suggested that fungal lineages that experience chromosome and genome duplication quickly go extinct, leaving no trace in the genomic record, while others contend that the lack of known WGD is due to an absence of data. Under the second hypothesis, additional sampling and deeper sequencing of fungal genomes should lead to the discovery of more WGD events. Coupling hundreds of recently published genomes from nearly every described Saccharomycotina species with three additional long-read assemblies, we discovered three novel WGD events. While the functions of retained duplicate genes originating from these events are broad, they bear many similarities to the well-known WGD that occurred in the Saccharomycetales.

To address this gap, we developed TAILVAR (Terminal codon Analysis and Improved prediction of Lengthened VARiants), a machine-learning classifier that integrates multi-omics features spanning transcript- and protein-level properties, along with variant effect annotations. Our analyses showed that transcripts lacking downstream stop codons in the 3' untranslated region exhibit lower evolutionary constraints. Additionally, we observed that deleterious variants exhibit greater C-terminal hydrophobicity, which is associated with reduced protein stability and increased degradation, as well as a higher aggregation propensity. TAILVAR outperformed existing benchmarks, demonstrating the highest correlation with functional experiments and establishing thresholds to classify variants as benign or pathogenic. This work offers a systematic framework for interpreting stop-loss variants, providing precise predictions of elongated protein effects that may aid genetic diagnosis and facilitate the discovery of novel disease-associated genes.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

E.; Roussos, P.", "abstract": "Statistical methods often make assumptions about independence between the samples or features of a dataset. Yet correlation structure is ubiquitous in real data, so these assumptions are often not met in practice. Whitening transformations are widely applied to remove this correlation structure. Existing approaches to whitening are based on standard linear algebra, rather than a probabilistic model, and application to high dimensional datasets with n samples and p features is problematic as p approaches or exceeds n. Moreover, the computational time becomes prohibitive since the naive transform is cubic in p. Here we propose a probabilistic model for data whitening and examine its properties based on first principles as p increases. We demonstrate the statistical properties of the probabilistic model and derive a remarkably efficient algorithm that is linear instead of cubic time in the number of features. We examine the out-of-sample performance of the probabilistic whitening model on simulated data, as well as real gene expression and genotype data. In an application to impute z-statistics from unobserved genetic variants from a genome-wide association study of schizophrenia, the probabilistic whitening transformation, implemented in our open source R package decorrelate, had the lowest mean square error while being up to an order of magnitude faster than other methods.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

This environment is not constant but subject to short-term fluctuations and long-term shifts. This significantly complicates the task of plant breeders in finding a balance between adapting their germplasm for the short- and long-term. Here we build on previous work of us that investigated the implications of genetic complexity on breeding program design, by adding an environmental dimension in the form of the E(NK) model to the simulation framework. We found that the addition of environmental interactivity and change creates greater uncertainty associated with pursuing any specific selection trajectory, as compared to a static environment. This advantages preserving genetic variability and genetic landscape exploration over quickly exposing additive variation by constraining genetic space around a particular and temporary local optimum. Nonetheless, we found that also in a dynamically changing environment, a structure in which several breeding programs explore genetic space while maintaining constant germplasm exchange, finds the best balance between short and long-term objectives, as opposed to isolated programs or one large undifferentiated program, which exclusively emphasize short respectively long-term objectives. We furthermore highlight the difficulty of exchanging germplasm to restore genetic variability with non-stationary and germplasm context dependent genetic effects. In summary we found that also with addition of environmental complexity and change, the structural features that characterized breeding operations hitherto and allowed them to navigating biological complexity apply. Namely the necessity to constraining genetic space in order for heritable additive variation to emerge. We end by arguing that optimal breeding program design depends on the level of genetic and environmental complexity, which should be appropriately reflected when modeling the long-term behavior of selection programs and the implications of specific interventions into these.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

In aquaculture, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are particularly vulnerable to skin pathogens, notably the ectoparasitic salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). As the skin represents the first line of immunological defence, its capacity to mediate host-pathogen interactions may be influenced by dietary vitamin D. This study investigated the transcriptomic response of salmon skin following six months of dietary vitamin D supplementation, with a focus on immune-related gene expression. A total of 113 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, 46 of which are implicated in inflammation, immune signalling, and both innate and adaptive immunity. These DEGs were further compared to published RNA-seq data of salmon skin challenged with L. salmonis. Notably, while pro-inflammatory genes were regulated in opposing directions, heat shock proteins, lysozyme and antimicrobial peptides were consistently upregulated under both conditions. These findings suggest that vitamin D may modulate cutaneous immune responses by dampening inflammation and enhancing innate defences, potentially improving resistance to skin-associated pathogens such as salmon lice.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

However, translating those geometric navigation cues into actively driven microrobots is an open, largely unexplored challenge. Here, inspired by the structure of sperm cells, we introduce a sound-propelled head-helix microparticle (microrobot) featuring an elliptical head and a spiral tail. This asymmetrical design interacts with the incident acoustic field, generating complex secondary flows that induce a torque, enabling the particle to reorient around its cross-section. The microparticle exhibits a preferred direction of propulsion and orientation when exposed to a traveling sound wave, reorienting if its initial alignment deviates from this preference. Both the preferred direction and orientation can be modulated by adjusting the sound frequency, and they further adapt to background flow fields in the environment. Furthermore, the microparticle exhibits rheotaxis-like motion, exhibiting wall-following motion with frequency-dependent sliding behavior. By moving towards the channel wall, it enters the region with the smallest flow velocities, allowing it to move antiparallel to the fluid.

By comparing two conditions, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the differences between them. Currently, the mainstream methods in differential graph inference are mathematical optimization algorithms, including sparse optimization based on Gaussian graphical models or sparse Bayesian regression. These methods can eliminate many false positives in graphs, but at the cost of heavy reliance on the prior distributions of data or parameters, and they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To address these challenges, we introduce a new architecture called the Flippable Siamese Differential Neural Network (FSDiffNet). We originally established the concept of flippability and the theoretical foundation of flippable neural networks, laying the groundwork for building a flippable neural network. This theoretical framework guided the design of architecture and components, including the SoftSparse activation function and high-dilation circular padding diagonal convolution. FSDiffNet uses large-scale pre-training techniques to acquire differential features and perform differential graph inference. Through experiments with simulated and real datasets, FSDiffNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple metrics, effectively inferring key differential factors related to conditions such as autism and breast cancer.

J.; Piasecki, M.", "abstract": "Aim: This study aimed to investigate age-related and limb-specific differences in neuromuscular function of vastus lateralis. While muscle strength is critical for functional independence in ageing, asymmetries between the dominant and non-dominant limbs, which can arise from central or peripheral mechanisms, are not well understood. We specifically examined whether bilateral differences exist in neuromuscular function and motor unit (MU) firing behaviours in young and older people, and whether these differences vary with task complexity. Methods: Twenty-one healthy young adults (22 (4) years; 15M, 6F) and seventeen healthy older adults (74 (5) years; 12M, 5F) were recruited. High-density surface electromyography signals were collected bilaterally from the vastus lateralis during constant and variable load contractions normalised to maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) and decomposed into individual MU spike trains. Muscle strength and force control as well as MU firing properties were compared bilaterally using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models. Statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05. Results: Older adults showed reduced maximal voluntary force, increased force tracking error, and lower MU firing rates (MUFR), particularly during sinusoidal contractions. Force steadiness and MUFR variability revealed distinct Leg x AgeGroup interactions: older adults had greater variability in non-dominant legs, while younger adults showed the opposite. MU firing properties differed between contraction types, with age-related impairments most evident during dynamic tasks. Conclusion: These findings highlight that neuromuscular ageing is not uniformly bilateral but involves asymmetric adaptations, especially under dynamic force demands. Despite symmetrical limb use, leg dominance effects become more pronounced with age, potentially reflecting compensatory neuromuscular strategies. Task complexity amplifies these asymmetries, underscoring the need to consider limb-specific neural control when addressing age-related motor decline.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Our study aims to determine the specific clinical significance of SOR across diverse child samples and establish whether SOR is associated with distinct patterns of functional connectivity (FC). We analyzed data from 15,728 children (ages 6-17.9 years) across five datasets: three community samples, including the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] and Healthy Brain Network [HBN] studies, and two autism-enriched samples. Bivariate and multivariate models examined associations between SOR and symptoms of anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder, as well as autistic traits. Analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from the ABCD study tested brain-wide and circuit-specific FC correlates of mild SOR, replication of effects in an independent ABCD subsample, as well as extension to severe SOR in ABCD and to SOR in the HBN sample. Multivariate analyses revealed that SOR is associated with a remarkably consistent transdiagnostic profile: greater levels of both autistic traits and anxiety symptoms and, in community samples, lower levels of conduct disorder symptoms. Across samples, SOR is not reliably associated with symptoms of any other analyzed psychiatric conditions. Resting state fMRI analyses reveal that SOR is associated with both brain-wide and circuit-specific functional connectivity (FC) patterns in networks related to tactile processing (somatomotor-hippocampal) and error detection (cingulo opercular-ventral diencephalon) that replicate in independent subsamples. Our results demonstrate that SOR may constitute a transdiagnostic latent trait with both specific clinical risk and protection, and with replicable neural correlates that implicate specific cortico-subcortical circuits.

In zebrafish (Danio rerio) research, these interactions can introduce uncontrolled sources of variation, potentially confounding experimental outcomes across multiple facilities. Despite widespread zebrafish use in microbiome studies, few have characterized the microbial composition of both tank water and fish across multiple independent facilities to evaluate the consequences of environmental microbiome variation on the host microbiome. Results: We compared water and zebrafish gut microbiomes across five aquaculture facilities- two in the United States and three in Norway- using a nested sampling design and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Alpha diversity was consistently higher in tank water than in fish guts, and beta diversity metrics revealed distinct clustering by sample type, facility, and location. Differences in microbial community composition were significant across facilities, with both water and fish samples exhibiting facility-specific profiles. Similarity Percentage analysis identified taxonomic groups driving these differences, while Fast Expectation-Maximization for Microbial Source Tracking detected measurable contributions of tank water microbiota to zebrafish gut communities. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values were lowest between fish and water from the same tank and increased with geographic and facility distance, indicating local microbial overlap. Relative abundance patterns and ordination plots further supported distinct and structured microbial assemblages across systems. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that zebrafish aquaculture systems harbor unique microbial communities shaped by both environmental and geographic factors, with tank water acting as a potential source of gut-associated microbes. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating environmental microbiome assessments into zebrafish experimental design, particularly for studies focused on host-microbe interactions. Without such consideration, unaccounted variation in environmental microbiota may affect microbiome composition and reduce cross-study reproducibility. Moving forward, standardized reporting of environmental conditions and microbial composition across facilities will be critical for strengthening reproducibility and interpretation in zebrafish microbiome research.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Causality analysis of electrical potential during a period without artificial stimulation indicated that the magnitude of potential information flow across the sporocarps was not restricted to the sporocarps belonging to the same genet (clone) nor within a species. Howeverm this was still negatively associated with genetic as well as spatial distances. The effects of artificial stimulation (water and urine addition) on the average magnitude of information flow across the sporocarps were positive when tap water was added locally to a certain sporocarp but were negative when tap water was added to all the sporocarps. In contrast, the addition of urine had minimal effect on the magnitude of information flow.

Determining the frequency of remdesivir triphosphate (RTP) incorporation in the presence of the competing ATP can help in understanding different modes of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibition by NTP analogs. We employed enzymatic assays, mass spectrometry, and cryo-EM to show that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp preferentially incorporates RTP, outcompeting 10-fold higher ATP concentration; however, successive RTP incorporations are less favoured when ATP is present. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in this and previous studies demonstrate resilience of remdesivir:UMP base pair to translocation, explaining the reduced preference for conjugate incorporations. Together, the RTP versus ATP incorporation is driven by their relative concentration and structural rigidity of remdesivir:UMP, ultimately limiting the number of incorporated remdesivir in a fully synthesized RNA strand. The S759A mutant confers RTP resistance, and the structures of S759A RdRp catalytic complexes reveal that altered ribose-ring conformation and repositioning of the primer 3'-end nucleotide contribute to RTP resistance. These findings enhance our understanding of non-obligate NTP analogs and provide insight into S759A resistance mechanism.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Understanding how ribozymes emerge from RNA populations under changing selection pressures is essential for reconstructing early biochemical systems. In vitro selection has been instrumental in isolating ribozymes from combinatorial populations; however, their population dynamics during selection remains poorly characterized. By analyzing high-throughput sequencing data from all eight rounds of an in vitro selection experiment, consisting of over 5 million unique sequences, we were able to track how sequences rise and fall in abundance during selection. We found that the most abundant sequences emerged early and maintained their dominance, suggesting that only a few cycles of selection-amplification may be sufficient to isolate well-adapted ribozymes. Nucleotide conservation analysis of the dominant ribozyme family and experimental characterization of rare variants indicated that abundance did not always predict activity. Our analyses show that sequence complementarity with the substrate emerged as a common feature in as early as the first round, highlighting early convergence of diverse sequence populations on a beneficial catalytic strategy. Our work presents the most detailed description of ribozyme population dynamics during an in vitro selection experiment and provides a high-resolution view of how RNA sequences compete for survival and propagation.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Normalizing heart weight (HW) to body weight (BW) or tibia length (TL) is a common practice; however, the validity of these ratios has been questioned due to non-proportional relationships between parameters, and this becomes particularly problematic when comparing distinct populations based on such normalized values. Using data from over 25,000 C57BL/6N wildtype mice provided by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), we investigated the limitations of ratio-based normalization when comparing different groups, aiming to propose a robust framework for HW analysis. Our findings reveal negligible to weak correlations between HW, BW, and TL across age and sex groups, undermining the validity of ratio-based methods. A modelling study using simulated data demonstrated that ratios could produce misleading results, including reversed or false group differences, when scaling assumptions are violated. Ratios yield accurate and interpretable results only when a truly proportional relationship exists between the variables, specifically, when the regression line passes through the origin, conditions under which ratio-based normalization aligns with outcomes obtained from more robust modelling approaches. These results underscore the superiority of linear models with covariate adjustment and allometric scaling for organ weight analysis, as they more accurately capture biologically relevant scaling relationships. By leveraging the IMPC's large-scale wildtype dataset, we establish the necessity of reassessing normalization practices in quantitative biology traits and propose that ratios should be avoided when comparing normalized values across distinct populations unless key mathematical assumptions are met.

M.; Maltby, C.; Todd, P.", "abstract": "Repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation is a non-canonical initiation event that occurs in the absence of a start codon in repeat expansion disorders, generating aggregation-prone proteins which may contribute to pathogenicity. The mechanism by which repeats trigger RAN translation is not completely understood, with most prior work focused on how repeats might elicit initiation when placed within a 5 leader in reporter plasmids. However, RAN translation is also reported to generate out-of-frame proteins in Huntington disease (HD), where a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene (HTT) resides within the coding sequence of the gene. To explore this process, we generated a series of RAN translation-specific reporter constructs that include the 5 leader and first exon of HTT and compared their translation to CGG and GGGGCC repeats. CAG repeats support RAN translation in both the alanine (GCA) and glutamine (CAG) frames in both the presence and absence of upstream start codons or near-AUG cognate codons. HTT RAN translation in the alanine frame is comparable in efficiency to polyalanine RAN translation from CGG repeats and exhibits cap-dependence and selective enhancement by activation of the integrated stress response. Importantly, this translation was readily detectable from in vitro transcribed RNAs transfected into neurons or cellular lysates, suggesting that plasmid based aberrant splicing into CAG repeats does not explain the observed phenomena. CAG repeats in the context of HTT exon 1 elicit neuronal toxicity in the absence of any AUG initiation codons. Taken together, these data suggest that RAN translation shares key mechanistic parameters across different repeat sequences and surrounding RNA contexts with implications for therapy development.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Using in vivo and in vitro two-photon imaging, we discovered that the artificial elimination of spines triggers a two-stage compensatory response: rapid enlargement of remaining spines followed by delayed spine regeneration. Remarkably, similar structural plasticity was observed across multiple Amyloid beta-driven models of synapse loss, including the APP/PS1 mouse and following intracortical delivery of oligomeric Amyloid beta. Mechanistically, compensatory spine enlargement required NMDA receptor activation and de novo protein synthesis.

This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic and mechanistic role of melatonin in BD using transcriptomics. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from 216 post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples (156 controls, 60 BD) were used to generate gene regulatory networks (GRNs). These were compared to lists of melatonin-related genes using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to assess differential expression between people with BD and controls. Furthermore, RNAseq data from NT2-N cells treated with lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, or quetiapine were compared to lists of melatonin-related genes using GSEA. Finally, BD-associated gene regulatory patterns were compared to GRNs induced by melatoninergic agents to evaluate the repurposing potential of these pharmacotherapies for BD. Genes involved in inhibiting melatonin signalling were nominally upregulated in the BD post-mortem gene expression dataset. Transcription factors (TFs) activating melatonin signalling tended to be downregulated in BD females, while TFs inhibiting melatonin signalling were significantly downregulated in BD males. Regarding current treatments, quetiapine caused the greatest number of significant alterations in melatonin-related gene expression, followed by valproate, lithium, and then lamotrigine. Valproate was found to significantly upregulate genes involved in melatonin degradation. Finally, the melatonin receptor agonist GR-135531 was identified as a possible repurposing candidate for BD. Overall, this study provides new evidence that dysregulation of melatonin-related genes may play a role in the pathophysiology of BD, and suggests a number of melatoninergic agents as potential therapeutic candidates for BD.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

While CASM is commonly described as a cytoprotective response to multiple types of membrane damage, the ways in which CASM helps cells maintain homeostasis are still unclear. Here, we show that CASM contributes to the maintenance or repair of Golgi apparatus architecture following the loss of TRIM46, a ubiquitin ligase with roles in microtubule organization. TRIM46-deficient cells were notable for enhanced TFEB-driven lysosomal biogenesis and Golgi ribbon fragmentation, with colocalization between the trans-Golgi marker TGN46 and the Atg8 proteins LC3B and GABARAP. Similar results were seen when Golgi architecture was disrupted by inhibitors of microtubule assembly or of vesicle trafficking. Further studies revealed that the Golgi atg8ylation seen in TRIM46 knockout cells was not degradative and mechanistically resembled CASM. Genetic inhibition of CASM in TRIM46-deficent cells reduced TFEB activation and exacerbated the Golgi morphology defects. Together, these studies reveal that lysosomal biogenesis and CASM are common features of a Golgi damage response, with CASM acting to preserve Golgi integrity.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

Formation of the cellular machinery for energy production is an essential step in proximal tubule epithelial cell (PTC) differentiation, and this report focuses on how mitochondria in nascent PTCs are redistributed from their initial apical position to their ultimate basolateral location. We found that mitochondria move from the apical to basolateral side of the PTC coincident with the initiation of lumen flow and that proximal tubules deficient in filtration (aglomerular mice and kidney organoids) maintain their mitochondria in the apical position, indicating that flow is necessary and sufficient for localization. Further, we show that mitochondrial localization depends on the activity of LRRK2 in vitro and in vivo. Modeling the effect of fluid flow on PTCs demonstrates that LRRK2 activity is regulated by fluid shear stress, providing an explanation for how onset of flow in the newly differentiated proximal tubule may trigger the apical-to-basolateral dissemination of mitochondria that forms the template for subsequent PTC maturation. Our findings indicate that mitochondrial redistribution is one component of a cellular program in the nascent PTC that drives function and that this process is regulated by flow.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

How environmental contexts influence selection for cooperation is currently poorly understood and lacks experimental evidence from systems exhibiting behavioural plasticity in collective acts. This study investigates group size dependent selection on collective chemical defence in a gregarious pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer). Larvae perform chemical defence by secreting a costly deterrent fluid while adopting a U-posture. By manipulating group size and the individual's ability to deploy the defensive fluid for the collective good, we show that survival against predation is higher in cooperative groups and that the benefits gained via collective defence are more pronounced in smaller groups. As predicted by theory, individuals participate less in collective defence in larger groups than in smaller ones. This lower contribution is not attributed to higher life-history costs from increased resource competition.

They are used to studying cancer development, testing drug effectiveness, and potentially guiding treatment decisions for individual patients. Spheroids represent the simplest form of three-dimensional (3D) cellular arrangement and encapsulate the essential tumor microenvironment. These characteristics are crucial for studying processes such as tumor invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and cell cycle kinetics. In particular, spheroids excel in chemo-response assays where traditional monolayer cell cultures often fall short. A PDMS microwell device was developed to generate uniform-sized cancer spheroids. This device is user-friendly and capable of producing a large number of spheroids. The device measures 13 mm in diameter (1200 microwells per well if the device has microwells 400 m in size, and 300 microwells per well if the device has microwells 800 m in size). It advances 3D cultures by requiring only a small volume of cell culture supplements and is easy to manage. The hydrophobic nature of the PDMS device prevents cells from adhering to it, thereby promoting spheroid formation. Spheroids can be created on microwell devices, and subsequent experiments may either be conducted on the device or transferred to cell culture dishes for additional 3D biological assays. Seeding cells is notably easier compared to other 3D cell culture techniques, and the number of cells in each spheroid can be adjusted according to specific requirements.

Using a combination of brain-wide activity mapping, behavioural and molecular analysis in response to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a GABAA receptor antagonist, we assessed neural hyperexcitability at different developmental stages in larval zebrafish and observed a distinct age-dependent trajectory. Specifically, we observed that early stages (4-6 dpf) exhibited high susceptibility to external perturbations, whereas by 9 dpf, both neural activity and behavioral responses were markedly attenuated.

Here, we test the hypothesis that differences in chromatin accessibility and specific histone marks may underlie transcriptional differences linked to these functional responses. Confocal imaging of cultured cells revealed higher levels of the transcriptionally permissive histone marks H3K27ac and H4K8ac in pediatric than adult derived late progenitors and mature OLs. Levels were higher in adult-derived progenitors versus mature cells from the same individuals. The majority of pathways and genes related to myelination and immune interactions were downregulated in adult cell samples when compared to pediatric samples. Analysis of publicly available datasets indicated that the chromatin accessibility for genes within these categories was more restricted in adult than pediatric OLs. There was less chromatin accessibility and lower H3K27ac chromatin occupancy also in more differentiated OL compared to progenitors. The levels of the transcriptionally repressive H3K27me3 histone mark in mature OLs were enriched in genomic regions encoding for transcriptional inhibitors of myelination and related signaling pathways, as compared to early progenitors.

For example, when detecting transient changes in the environment, it is best to focus evaluation on the current evidence as opposed to older evidence. However, it is unclear how this adjustment in timescale is achieved in the brain in terms of how the neurons that process evidence adjust their dynamics. To address this question, we used Neuropixel probes to record spiking activity from neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of rats performing a free-response auditory change detection task in which subjects evaluate sensory evidence over short timescales to determine when a change occurs in a noisy sensory stream. Consistent with longer timescale temporal integration tasks, we found that PPC neurons modulated their activity by the strength of evidence leading to decisions, were selective for the rats choices, and had opposing populations of neurons that were positively versus negatively modulated by evidence. However, in contrast to temporal integration tasks, responses of neurons to individual pulses of evidence were transient, such that the effect of the evidence on activity tapered off over a timescale corresponding to the subjects behavioral timescale of evidence evaluation. Intriguingly, PPC also exhibited \"gain changes\" in the influence of evidence as a function of decision time that were consistent with changes in behavioral urgency. In addition, reversible inactivation revealed an important role for PPC in this auditory change detection, such that PPC inactivation altered choice behavior and the timescale over which rats evaluated evidence. Together, our results suggest important contributions of PPC to free-response decisions that involve adjusting timescales of evidence evaluation.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

L.; Nicola, W.; Bains, J.; Muller, L.; Inoue, W.", "abstract": "Stress triggers rapid and reversible shifts in vital physiological functions from homeostatic operation to emergency response. However, the neural mechanisms regulating such functional stress states remain poorly understood. Here we identify a novel recurrent inhibitory circuit governing functional states of key stress regulatory neurons: corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Microendoscopic calcium imaging in freely behaving mice revealed synchronized low-activity state at baselines and a reversible high-activity state during mild stress. Ensemble analysis indicated increased dimensionality of network dynamics during high-activity state. Computational modeling of calcium ensemble data, together with independent modeling of single-unit CRHPVN neurons spiking dynamics, converged to show that recurrent inhibition is a key circuit motif for stress-induced functional state transitions. Guided by model predictions, chemogenetic manipulations of PVN-projecting GABAergic neurons revealed their roles in constraining CRHPVN neurons to low-activity state at baselines via a prolonged feedback inhibition. Unexpectedly, slow CRHergic excitation was dispensable for driving this prolonged feedback, whereas glutamatergic transmission predominated at CRHPVN[-&gt;]PVN[-&gt;]GABA excitatory synapses. Incorporating these findings, we refined our computational model to include fast excitation and slow inhibition, yielding new predictions for circuit operation. Together, our results establish recurrent inhibition as a fundamental circuit motif controlling CRHPVN neurons functional states and highlight the value of iterative experiment-model integration in advancing understanding of neural circuits functions.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

T.; Ross, B. L.; Aubuchon, E. A.; Lane, M. E.; Gomez, A. C.; Lee, Y.; Chen, S.; Crother, T. R.; Arditi, M. A.; Noval Rivas, M.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, regulates cardiovascular inflammation by modulating cellular stress, inhibiting NLRP3 activation, and promoting the clearance of damaged mitochondria. However, its precise role in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease (KD), a pediatric systemic vasculitis and the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children, remains unclear. METHODS: Using the Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE) murine model of KD, we evaluated the severity of vasculitis in mice supplemented with NAD+ precursors, as well as transgenic mice overexpressing SIRT1, and mice with specific deletion of Sirt1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and myeloid cells. Proteomics analysis was performed on the abdominal aortas of WT and SIRT1-overexpressing mice. We performed immunofluorescent staining of cardiovascular tissues to assess the expression of proteins related to the autophagy/mitophagy pathway and the pathogenic switch of VSMCs. Western blot analysis was performed on primary VSMCs and cardiovascular tissues to determine the impact of SIRT1 on autophagic flux. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was measured in bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal lavage of transgenic mice using ELISAs. RESULTS: SIRT1 expression was downregulated in cardiovascular lesions of LCWE-injected mice, which was associated with a significant reduction of circulating levels of nicotinamide. Supplementation of mice with NAD+ precursors or genetic overexpression of SIRT1 significantly reduced the development of LCWE-induced KD, while the specific deletion of Sirt1 in VSMCs or myeloid cells exacerbated vasculitis. Proteomics analysis indicated impaired mitophagy/autophagy and the pathogenic synthetic switch of VSMCs in LCWE-injected mice, which was rescued with SIRT1 overexpression and associated with reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the presence of an impaired NAD+-SIRT1 axis in the pathogenesis of LCWE-induced KD vasculitis and the therapeutic potential of targeting this axis to reduce cardiovascular lesions and inflammation.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

To identify mosquitoes that could act as MADV vectors, we assessed the vector competence of Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. taeniorhynchus, Culex tarsalis, Cx. coronator, and Cx. quinquefasciatus, following oral exposure to MADV isolated in Panama (all species) or Brazil (Ae. taeniorhynchus only). MADV RNA and infectious virus were quantified from mosquito bodies, legs, and saliva. At 14 days post-exposure, five species had virus in all biological sample types. Culex quinquefasciatus was susceptible to infection and dissemination but had no positive saliva samples. Aedes taeniorhynchus showed higher infection probabilities with MADV-BR. Time-course analysis revealed distinct dynamics in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Our findings indicate MADV may be compatible with mosquito species present in endemic regions and areas at risk of virus introduction.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

D.; Strausbach, M.; Goodyke, A.; Crimp, L. C.; Lee, D. K.; Armant, D. R.; Drewlo, S.", "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) remains difficult to predict, particularly when it manifests late in gestation. To capture early placental signals, we profiled trophoblast cells sampled from the cervix in the first trimester using mass cytometry (CyTOF). We established protocols for clinical sample storage and applied spike-in reference control cells to deliver reproducible, batch-corrected protein measurements, thereby advancing CyTOF from a discovery tool to a translational platform. Within HLA-GCD45- cells, we identified canonical CK7 extravillous trophoblasts, as well as a previously unrecognized CK7- subset, and both subsets expressed placental proteins. Expression of PAPP-A, GAL-13, and GAL-14 was significantly altered in a pilot cohort of pregnancies that subsequently developed late-onset PE, distinguishing cases from controls at both single-marker and multivariate levels. These findings reveal unexpected trophoblast heterogeneity, demonstrate that placental alterations are detectable before the development of late-onset PE, and establish cervical trophoblast profiling as a promising platform for scalable biomarker discovery and first-trimester risk assessment in placenta-mediated disorders.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "The routine exclusion of admixed individuals from traditional Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) due to concerns about spurious associations has hindered genetic analyses involving multiple ancestries. Tractor GWAS addresses this issue by incorporating local ancestry into its analysis, empowering identification of ancestry-enriched hits and generating ancestry-specific summary statistics. However, Tractor requires accurate genomic phasing and local ancestry inference as prerequisite steps, which requires additional bioinformatics expertise and decision points regarding reference panel setup. To streamline, harmonize, and automate this process, we present a scalable Nextflow workflow that integrates all necessary steps, minimizing the need for manual intervention while remaining modular and customizable. The workflow supports multiple commonly used tools and offers flexibility in how Tractor is implemented. To demonstrate its utility, we applied this pipeline to analyze 32 blood biomarkers in 6,245 two-way AFR-EUR admixed individuals from the UK Biobank. This pipeline ran efficiently at scale, replicated known associations, and identified novel ancestry-specific loci. These novel associations were largely driven by variants present on African ancestral tracts but absent from European tracts, underscoring the value of local ancestry-aware methods in uncovering previously missed genetic signals. By enabling the efficient analysis of admixed individuals, our workflow facilitates Tractor use, paving the way for more broader genetic discovery.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

However, the resulting genetic changes and their association with the subsequent behavioral, neuroanatomical and reproductive changes remain poorly understood. Here, we compared gene expression in HVC, a major song control nucleus, between the non-breeding and breeding season in male northern house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) and we examined associations with HVC volume, plasma testosterone concentrations, and testes size. Differential gene expression analysis identified three genes (CLIP4, FAM169A, and TTR) consistently linked to seasonal transitions from non-breeding to three breeding stages (pre-laying, egg-laying and incubation). Notably, TTR, which transports thyroid hormone (TH), was highly expressed in the nonbreeding season, consistent with a possible role of TH in regulating seasonal shifts in song output and structure. We also identified seasonal changes in networks of genes related to neural connectivity, cellular restructuring, and cell migration. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed gene clusters specifically correlated with testosterone and HVC volume. Testosterone-associated genes included genes involved in neural circuit remodeling, chromatin organization, and cytoskeletal dynamics, consistent with testosterone-mediated regulation of these neuroanatomical changes. Genes linked to seasonal increases in HVC volume were involved in neuronal restructuring and neuron migration, implicating these genes in seasonal neurogenesis. Together, our findings link novel gene expression patterns to hormone regulation and neurogenesis underlying seasonal transitions in birdsong.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}

This approach lacks biological justification, creates dataset-dependent classifications, and ignores the relative regulatory relationships between genes that are often more biologically meaningful than absolute cutoffs. We introduce a novel pairwise ranking approach that compares relative expression levels between gene pairs based on their histone modification patterns, eliminating arbitrary threshold selection. Evaluation using the REMC E066 and GSE76344 datasets showed that our pairwise classification framework demonstrated consistent ranking performance in both datasets. The ablation study found that only a subset of histone modification types is necessary, giving evidence of redundancy in the biological code.", "date": "2025-09-04", "journal": ""}
