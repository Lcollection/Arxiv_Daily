Here we introduce 'circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing' (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "Neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation is controlled by cell-intrinsic and external signals from the stem cell niche including niche surface glia (SG). However, the mechanisms by which transcription factors drive NSC differentiation within the niche remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the Drosophila melanogaster transcription factor, Chromatin-linked adaptor for MSL proteins (CLAMP) is required for regulation of stemness and proliferation of NSCs, especially of the optic lobe (OL). CLAMP promotes transcription of genes involved in stemness, proliferation, and glial development and represses transcription of genes involved in neurogenesis and niche survival. Consistent with transcriptional changes, CLAMP promotes NSC proliferation and niche SG production, while lack of CLAMP severely and specifically impacts OL development. To identify potential mechanisms by which CLAMP may regulate brain development, we examined CLAMP motifs and available CLAMP ChIP-seq data to determine which genes may be direct versus indirect targets. CLAMP motifs are present at many target genes including the glial-determining gene, glial cells missing, while Tailless, the master regulator of OL- development is directly bound by CLAMP. In accordance to these results, in larval OL NSCs lacking CLAMP, Tailless levels are decreased dramatically, suggesting that CLAMP controls OL neurogenesis via Tailless. Overall, our results suggest that CLAMP regulates a transcriptional program which drives NSC proliferation and differentiation via cell-intrinsic and niche-dependent mechanisms that involve transcriptional regulation of Tailless and niche glia.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Z.; Fernandes, J.; Esparza, J.; Suda, K.; Fernandez de Sevilla, M. E.; Diaz-Pacheco, S.; Aleman, I. T.", "abstract": "The brain relies on interoceptive feedback signals to regulate bodily functions. Mice with low serum IGF-1 levels (LID mice) exhibit reduced spontaneous running, a behavior that normalizes after sustained systemic IGF-1 treatment. This observation led us to hypothesize that circulating IGF-1, a key regulator of skeletal muscle and bone mass that crosses the blood-brain barrier during physical activity, may convey body vigor information to the brain. Since hypothalamic orexin neurons, that are involved in regulating physical activity, express IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) and are modulated by this growth factor, we hypothesized that these neurons might gauge circulating IGF-1 levels to modulate physical activity. Indeed, inactivation of IGF-1R in mouse orexin neurons (Firoc mice) was associated to less time spent in free running. These mice maintain physical fitness but display altered mood and are less sensitive to the rewarding actions of exercise. Further, in response to exercise, Firoc mice showed limited c-fos activation of hypothalamic orexin neurons and monoaminergic neurons of the ventro-tegmental area (VTA) in the brainstem. This area is involved in the rewarding component of exercise that seems to be modulated by IGF-1, as mice receiving systemic IGF-1 showed increased c-fos expression in VTA neurons, while mice with reduced IGF-1R expression in VTA neurons showed no improved mood after exercise. Collectively, these results suggest that circulating IGF-1 is gauged by orexin neurons to modulate physical activity, and that VTA neurons convey the rewarding properties of exercise through direct actions of IGF-1 on them. Hence, serum IGF-1 may constitute an interoceptive signal acting onto orexin/VTA neurons to modulate physical activity according to physical vigor (muscle and bone mass).", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Deletion of bclA3 leads to spores with an electron-dense exosporium layer that lacks bump-like structures in the electron-dense layer and hair-like projections, both structures typically found in the wild type spore. Therefore, in this work, we have addressed the role of the exosporium collagen-like BclA3 glycoprotein in the assembly of the exosporium layer. Immunogold labelling of BclA2CTD and BclA3CTD indicates that both proteins are located in the hairs, with BclA2 located outermost of BclA3. Absence of BclA3 leads to spores with no hair-like projections, and absence of bumps in thick exosporium spores, a phenotype also expressed in by the deletion of the collagen-like region of BclA3.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of metadata completeness shared in both scientific publications and/or public repositories by analyzing over 253 studies encompassing over 164 thousands samples. We observed that studies often omit over a quarter of important phenotypes, with an average of only 74.8% of them shared either in the text of publication or the corresponding repository. Notably, public repositories alone contained 62% of the metadata, surpassing the textual content of publications by 3.5%. Only 11.5% of studies completely shared all phenotypes, while 37.9% shared less than 40% of the phenotypes. Studies involving non-human samples were more likely to share metadata than studies involving human samples.

We compared resting state functional connectivity of visual cortices of blind adults (n = 30), blindfolded sighted adults (n = 50) to a large cohort of sighted infants (Developing Human Connectome Project, n = 475). Visual cortices of sighted adults show stronger coupling with non-visual sensory-motor networks (auditory, somatosensory/motor), than with higher-cognitive prefrontal cortices (PFC). In contrast, visual cortices of blind adults show stronger coupling with higher-cognitive PFC than with nonvisual sensory-motor networks. Are infant visual cortices functionally like those of sighted adults? Alternatively, do infants start like blind adults, with vision required to set up the sighted adult pattern? Remarkably, we find that, in infants, secondary visual cortices are more like those of blind adults: stronger coupling with PFC than with nonvisual sensory-motor networks, suggesting that visual experience establishes elements of the sighted-adult long-range connectivity. Infant primary visual cortices are in-between blind and sighted adults i.e., equal PFC and sensory-motor connectivity. The lateralization of occipital-to-frontal connectivity in infants resembles the sighted adults, consistent with reorganization by blindness.

The A13 is identified to project to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), with a subpopulation of cells displaying activity correlating to movement speed, suggesting its role in locomotion. We show that photoactivation of this A13 region can alleviate bradykinesia and akinetic features, while increasing turning in a mouse model of PD.

R.; Kryazhimskiy, S.", "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 gene drives (CCGDs) are powerful tools for genetic control of wild populations, with applications from disease eradication to species conservation. However, Cas9 alone and in a complex with gRNA can cause double-stranded DNA breaks at off-target sites, which could increase the mutational load and lead to unintended loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. These undesired effects raise potential concerns about the long-term evolutionary safety of CCGDs, but the magnitude of these effects is unknown. To measure how the presence of a CCGD or a Cas9 alone in the genome affects the rates of LOH events and de novo mutations, we carried out a mutation accumulation experiment in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found no detectable effects on the genome-wide rates of mutations or LOH events. Our power calculations suggest that CCGD or Cas9 affect these rates by less than 30%, which is much less than natural variation for these traits in yeast. A more detailed examination shows that CCGD or Cas9 may alter the lengths and genomic distributions of LOH events, but the statistical support for these effects is weak. Thus, our results demonstrate that CCGDs impose at most a weak additional mutational burden in the yeast model. Although mutagenic effects of gene drives need to be further evaluated in other systems, our results add credence to the proposition that the evolutionary risks posed by well designed gene drives are likely acceptable.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Axons with mitochondrial depletion showed abnormal protein accumulation and autophagic defects. Lowering neuronal ATP levels by blocking glycolysis did not reduce autophagy, suggesting that autophagic defects are associated with mitochondrial distribution. We found that eIF2beta was increased by the depletion of axonal mitochondria via proteome analysis. Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, another subunit of eIF2, was lowered, and global translation was suppressed. Neuronal overexpression of eIF2beta phenocopied the autophagic defects and neuronal dysfunctions, and lowering eIF2beta expression rescued those perturbations caused by depletion of axonal mitochondria.

Using the developing Xenopus laevis brain as a model system, we identified a critical crosstalk between tissue stiffness and long-range chemical signalling in vivo. Targeted knockdown of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) led to pathfinding errors in vivo. However, pathfinding errors were also observed in RGCs expressing Piezo1, when Piezo1 was downregulated in the surrounding brain tissue. Depleting Piezo1 in the brain parenchyma led to a decrease in the expression of the long-range chemical guidance cues Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) and Slit1, which instruct turning responses in distant cells. Furthermore, Piezo1 knockdown markedly reduced tissue stiffness. This tissue softening was independent of Sema3A depletion, and was caused by a decrease in the cell-cell adhesion proteins NCAM1 and N-Cadherin. Downregulating NCAM1 and N-Cadherin was sufficient to reduce tissue stiffness and Sema3A expression. Conversely, increasing environmental stiffness ex vivo resulted in enhanced tissue-level force generation and an increase in Slit1 and Sema3A expression. Moreover, stiffening soft brain regions in vivo induced ectopic Sema3A production via a Piezo1-dependent mechanism. Hence, tissue mechanics can locally modulate the availability of diffusive, long-range chemical signals, thus influencing cell function at sites distant from the mechanical cue. Such indirect regulatory mechanisms of cell function through mechanical signals are likely widespread across biological systems.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

For decades, it was thought to be caused by one species of whipworm, Trichuris trichiura. Significant differences in response rates to the best available anthelmintic treatment for trichuriasis, a combination of albendazole and ivermectin, exist across clinical trial reports yet the underlying reasons are unclear. Methods: Combining long- and short- read sequencing approaches, we assembled a high-quality reference genome of T. incognita n. sp. isolated in an interventional study conducted in Cote d Ivoire. The species tree of the Trichuris genus was constructed using 12434 orthologous groups. We sequenced a total of 747 individual worms which were used to confirm the phylogenetic placement and investigate patterns of adaptation through comparative genomic analysis. Findings: Here, we present and characterize a human-infecting Trichuris species that we named Trichuris incognita n. sp. Comparative genomic analysis of genes suspected to confer resistance to either albendazole or ivermectin in helminths revealed a high number of beta-tubulin (TBB) orthologs, present in the whole population of T. incognita n. sp., compared to the canonical T. trichiura species, but these genes were not associated to a resistant phenotype. We conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) comparing 179 albendazole-ivermectin sensitive to 542 drug non-sensitive worms, which did not conclusively show an adaptation to drug pressure within the same species. Interpretation: Our results demonstrate that trichuriasis can be caused by multiple species of whipworm and that the differences in response rates, may be a result of species responding differently to drug treatment, as opposed to an establishment of resistance. This discovery, coupled with the high tolerability of T. incognita n. sp. to albendazole-ivermectin marks a significant shift in how we understand and approach whipworm infections.

We systematically compared seven methods--PIC-O(D)GC; PIC-Pearson; PIC-MM, a robust phylogenetic regression method; PGLS; PGLMM (phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model); MR-PMM (multi-response phylogenetic mixed model); and Corphylo, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-based method--on 220,000 simulated datasets spanning five evolutionary scenarios (two shift settings: single-trait shifts and dual-trait co-directional jumps; and three no-shift gradual evolution settings), each tested across 11 shift or noise gradients, three tree sizes (16, 128, 256 tips), and both balanced and random topologies. Across all shift gradients, PIC-O(D)GC consistently yielded the lowest or among the lowest false-positive rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to PIC-MM. Under high-noise, no-shift conditions, it retained power similar to other methods but ran orders of magnitude faster than matrix-inversion models. Analyses of three empirical datasets likewise showed that PIC-O(D)GC and PIC-MM corrected shift-induced distortions that misled conventional methods. While matching PIC-MM in robustness, PIC-O(D)GC offers greater conceptual simplicity and markedly lower computational cost. Its correlation-only output provides less mechanistic detail than regression-based approaches like PGLS. However, when paired with PIC diagnostics, this outlier-guided strategy not only tests overall trait associations, but also highlights evolutionary jumps, distinguishes coupled from decoupled shifts, and--via clade partitioning or tip pruning--recovers background correlations, offering biologically informative insights into how punctuated events interact with gradual trends in trait evolution.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

For a highly social species like humans, one influential attentional cue is the direction of other people's gaze: by perceiving where others look and following their gaze, observers can increase their chances of detecting important information. This well-established phenomenon, called the gaze cueing effect (GCE), is traditionally considered reflexive. However, gaze-shifts do not always indicate external attention; they can also occur for other reasons, such as when attention is shifted inwards during effortful cognitive processing. The ability of observers to interpret the eye movements of other people correctly, while dissociating inwards and outwards attention shifts, is critical for efficient management of their attentional resources. In this study, we examined the role of context on the interpretation of other people's gaze. Across two preregistered experiments (total N=110), participants viewed gaze-shifts while performing a perceptual task. One group was primed to interpret gaze-shifts as reflecting inward attention deployment during cognitive effort, while the other was not provided with an interpretive context. The results revealed that GCE was reduced when gaze-shifts were perceived as linked to cognitive effort rather than external attention, indicating that attentional responses to gaze cues are context-dependent rather than purely reflexive. These findings highlight the flexibility of social attention, revealing that higher-order cognitive interpretation can override well-established attentional mechanisms. With its interdisciplinary approach, reexamining attentional processes in light of social cognition, this study offers new perspectives on the multifaceted socio-cognitive mind.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

H.; Chen, L.; McKay, G.; Rankin, R.; Meng, W.", "abstract": "Background: Current human retina studies predominantly utilize post-mortem tissue, and the sample accessibility constraints make the characterization of the living human retina at single-cell resolution a challenge. Although single-nucleus RNA-seq expands the utility of frozen samples, it provides a nuclear-centric view, potentially missing key cytoplasmic information and transient biological processes. Thus, it is important to generate resources directly from living human retinal tissue to complement existing datasets. Methods: We profiled 106,829 single cells from nine unfrozen human retina samples. Living samples were collected within10min of therapeutic enucleation and four postmortem samples were collected within 6h. After standardized dissociation, single-cell transcriptomes were generated using 10x Genomics 3' RNA-seq and applied scVI to generate batch-corrected integrated atlas. Major cell types and subtypes were annotated through iterative Leiden clustering, canonical markers. Subsequent analyses included differential expression comparisons between cell states and regulon activity profiling to further characterize cellular identities and regulatory networks. Transcriptional dynamics were assessed using RNA velocity, and cell-cell signaling pathways were inferred with CellChat. Key findings were validated in independent samples from two additional donors (four samples) using the identical workflow. Results: We contribute to establishing a reference for retinal cell type proportions and cellular states. Our analysis revealed ELF1-mlCone, a distinct cluster of mlCone photoreceptors identified by distinct transcriptional features. The presence and transcriptional features of this cluster were validated in independent samples. Additionally, by comparing living and post-mortem samples, our study highlights differences in transcriptional dynamics: living tissue preserved coherent RNA velocity streams, enabling clear dynamic state transitions, while post-mortem tissue exhibited disorganized patterns. These findings suggest that using living tissue can improve the capture of active cellular states and transitions. Conclusions: Our atlas provides a single cell reference contrasting living versus early post mortem human retina, integrating cell type composition, transcriptional diversity, and functional insights. It may serve as a useful resource for retinal research and for understanding aspects of human retinal biology, particularly given its inclusion of living tissue and diverse pathological states.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Interaction niches are intimately related to the notion of trait matching, which posits that a species interacts preferentially with partners whose traits are complementary to their own.\n\nMultivariate methods are commonly used to quantify species environmental niches (or Grinnellian niches). More recently, some of these methods have also been used to study the interaction niche, but they consider only the niche optimum and require trait data.\n\nIn this article, we use the correspondence analysis (CA) framework to study interaction networks and investigate trait matching without requiring trait data, using the notion of latent traits. We use reciprocal scaling, a method related to CA, to estimate niche optima and breadths, defined respectively as the mean and standard deviation of the latent traits of species interacting partners. We present the method, test its performance using a simulation model we designed, and analyze a real frugivory network between birds and plants.\n\nThe simulation study shows that the method is able to recover niche breadths and optima for data generated with parameters typical of ecological networks. The birds-plants network analysis shows strong relationships between species latent traits and niche breadths: a posteriori correlation with measured traits suggests that birds and plants of intermediate size tend to have the broadest niches. Additionally, birds preferentially foraging in the understory have broader niches than birds preferentially foraging in the canopy.\n\nCA and reciprocal scaling are described as fruitful exploratory methods to characterize species interaction profiles, provide an ecologically meaningful graphical representation of interaction niches, and explore the effect of latent traits on network structure.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Disruption of these regulators in mice leads to severe neurological phenotypes, and their misregulation is linked to human disease. However, the specific microexons involved in these phenotypes and the effects of individual microexon deletions on neurodevelopment, physiology, and behavior remain poorly understood. To explore this, we generated zebrafish lines with deletions of 18 individual microexons, alongside srrm3 and srrm4 mutant lines, and conducted comprehensive phenotypic analyses. We discovered that while loss of srrm3, alone or together with srrm4, resulted in significant alterations in neuritogenesis, locomotion, and social behavior, individual microexon deletions typically produced mild or no noticeable effects. Nonetheless, we identified specific microexons associated with defects in neuritogenesis (evi5b, vav2, itsn1, src) and social behavior (vti1a, kif1b). Additionally, most microexon deletions triggered coordinated transcriptomic changes in neural pathways, suggesting the presence of molecular compensatory mechanisms.

There is mounting evidence that intercropping can increase insect biodiversity while maintaining or increasing yield. Yet, intercropping is often considered impractical for mechanized farming systems. Strip cropping is a type of intercropping that is compatible with standard farm machinery and has been pioneered by Dutch farmers since 2014. Here, we present ground beetle data from four organically managed experimental farms across four years. Ground beetles are sensitive to changes in habitats and disturbances, and hold keystone positions in agroecosystem food webs. We show that strip cropping systems can enhance ground beetle biodiversity, while other studies showed that these increases have been achieved without incurring major yield loss. Strip cropped fields had on average 15% more ground beetle species and 30% more individuals than monocultural fields. The higher ground beetle richness in strip crops was explained by the merger of crop-related ground beetle communities, rather than by ground beetle species unique to strip cropping systems. The increase in field-level beetle species richness in organic agriculture through strip cropping approached increases found for other readily deployed biodiversity conservation methods, like shifting from conventional to organic agriculture (+19% - +23%). This indicates that strip cropping is a potentially useful tool supporting ground beetle biodiversity in agricultural fields without compromising food production.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

In contrast to the extensive morphological and molecular characterization of sensory neurons, there has been little description of the cells that control ion concentrations in the zebrafish olfactory system. Here, we report the molecular and ultrastructural characterization of zebrafish olfactory ionocytes. Transcriptome analysis suggests that the zebrafish olfactory epithelium contains at least three different ionocyte types, which resemble Na+/K+-ATPase-rich (NaR), H+-ATPase-rich (HR), and Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) cells, responsible for calcium, pH, and chloride regulation, respectively, in the zebrafish skin. In the olfactory epithelium, NaR-like and HR-like ionocytes are usually adjacent to one another, whereas NCC-like cells are usually solitary. The distinct subtypes are differentially distributed: NaR-like/HR-like cell pairs are found broadly within the olfactory epithelium, whereas NCC-like cells reside within the peripheral non-sensory multiciliated cell zone. Comparison of gene expression and serial-section electron microscopy analysis indicates that the NaR-like cells wrap around the HR-like cells and are connected to them by shallow tight junctions. The development of olfactory ionocyte subtypes is also differentially regulated, as pharmacological Notch inhibition leads to a loss of NaR-like and HR-like cells, but does not affect NCC-like ionocyte number. These results provide a molecular and anatomical characterization of olfactory ionocytes in a stenohaline freshwater teleost. The paired ionocytes suggest that both transcellular and paracellular transport regulate ion concentrations in the olfactory epithelium, while the solitary ionocytes may enable independent regulation of ciliary beating.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

In our recent discovery, we identified that TDP-43 plays an essential role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Here, we found persistent DNA damage in the brains of ALS/FTD patients, primarily in the transcribed regions of the genome. We further investigated the underlying mechanism and found that polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP) activity was severely impaired in the nuclear extracts of both patient brains and TDP-43-depleted cells. PNKP is a key player in DSB repair within the transcribed genome, where its 3'-P termini processing activity is crucial for preventing persistent DNA damage and neuronal death. The inactivation of PNKP in ALS/FTD was due to reduced levels of its interacting partner, phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase (PFKFB3), and its biosynthetic product, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), an allosteric modulator of glycolysis. Recent work from our group has shown that F2,6BP acts as a positive modulator of PNKP activity in vivo. Notably, exogenous supplementation with F2,6BP restored PNKP activity in nuclear extracts from ALS/FTD brain samples and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells harboring pathological mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that supplementation of F2,6BP restores genome integrity and partially rescues motor phenotype in a Drosophila model of ALS.

Notch signaling is sensitive to hemodynamic forces and governs mechanically-driven cardiovascular development, physiology, and remodeling.

We show that stress induces expression and relocalization of Jagged1 to cell junctions downstream of flow. Jagged1 expression under stress demonstrates magnitude dependence and peaks at 0.8-1Pa without impacting Jagged1s Notch-activation potential. On the contrary Jagged1 regulates the activity of mechanosensitive kinases. Deletion of Jagged1 reduces the activity of VEGFR2 and ERK in vitro and diminished ERK activity in zebrafish embryos without affecting canonical Notch signaling. Furthermore, the direct physical stimulation of Jagged1 using antibody-conjugated beads triggers the activation of VEGFR2 and ERK, mediated by Jagged1-induces Src activation.

Optimal codons, defined as those most commonly used in highly transcribed genes, are thought to arise from selection for cost-efficient translation, which would favor codons with abundant matching tRNAs. Such presumed selection is described as optimal codon choice. Non-optimal codons, defined as those least commonly used in highly transcribed genes, may in principle also play important roles, but the dynamics of their use remain understudied. Here we examine non-optimal codon use, using sex-biased genes expressed in the gonads of Drosophila melanogaster as a case study. We show that genes with sex-biased expression exhibit a preference for non-optimal codon use, especially testis-biased genes. Further we show that the use of non-optimal codons is not random. Instead, specific non-optimal codons are favored, again especially in testis-biased genes. Non-optimal codon use is positively linked to elevated disorder of the encoded proteins. Remarkably, all 18 degenerate amino acids were associated with higher disorder when encoded by the identified primary non-optimal codon, than when encoded by its sister optimal codon. We hypothesize that selection may have promoted non-optimal codon choice for a subset of favored non-optimal codons to regulate translation.

Serratia symbiotica CWBI-2.3T (CWBI), a culturable member of this group, is transmitted to embryos transovarially when it is injected into pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), the same route used by S. symbiotica strains that are vertically inherited endosymbionts. Yet, aphids colonized with CWBI die before they give birth to infected offspring. We evolved laboratory populations of CWBI through 15-30 serial passages at two different temperatures in rich media. These nutrient-replete conditions mimic aspects of the environment within aphid hosts that lead to the evolution of reduced endosymbiont genomes. Unexpectedly, all S. symbiotica populations propagated at one temperature appeared to evolve slower growth after only a few days due to reactivation of a lytic prophage from the CWBI genome. Though these populations continued to reach saturating cell densities slower than cultures of the ancestor throughout the experiment, representative clones isolated from them had mutations affecting lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and were resistant to the phage. Some evolved strains exhibited less virulence when injected into aphids, and we observed instances of gene inactivation and loss mediated by insertion elements. Our results illustrate how transposons and prophages can dominate laboratory evolution of newly cultured bacteria, particularly those that are host-associated in nature and have genomes rife with selfish DNA elements.

Our analysis uncovered 62 viable surface protein targets and 28,446 tumor-specific HLA-presented antigens, deriving from 11 distinct molecular events, across 21 tumor types. Among these, we identified 5,928 previously uncharacterized neoantigens, new tumor self-antigens, peptides derived from tumor-specific cryptic ORFs, tumor-associated microbial targets and a novel splicing-derived PMEL peptide (sPMEL) with enhanced abundance and safety compared to the canonical clinical targets. We successfully expanded sPMEL-specific T cells, validating the therapeutic potential of these targets in functional assays. We highlight 153 promising new tumor targets and experimentally validate 19 targets representing six antigen classes. In addition to being the most comprehensive atlas of targets in scope, ImmunoVerse offers the most extensively annotated resource with key parameters for target selection, providing critical insights for therapeutic prioritization and clinical translation. To catalyze therapeutic development, we released our pan-cancer target atlas through an interactive web portal (https://www.immuno-verse.com) and made the accompanying toolkits available to the scientific community. This work redefines the landscape of therapeutic T cell targets and provides a foundational resource to unlock immunotherapy development across multiple cancers previously considered intractable.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Conservation seed banks are an essential tool for ex-situ plant conservation. However, seeds stored long-term slowly deteriorate and lose viability. It is well established that seeds with high quality and thus high initial viability survive longer in storage. The rate of deterioration in storage is independent of the initial seed viability, and represents the actual seed longevity specific to species, and possibly to populations or even genotypes. While seed longevity is known to vary between species, the extent of variability within species and the factors driving it remain unclear. 2. We focused on both inter- and intraspecific variability in seed longevity and its predictors. We studied 41 common grassland species and 188 seed accessions from across Europe. We exposed the seeds to artificial ageing conditions (60% RH, 45 degree C) and used probit analysis to obtain the rate of seed viability loss ({sigma}) as a measure of seed longevity. We then tested the relationships between {sigma} and both accession- and species-specific factors. 3. Seed longevity ({sigma}) varied significantly among accessions in 58% of the species. Species identity explained 66% of the total variation, while accession-specific predictors together explained only 2.1%. Specifically, seed longevity increased with the mean annual temperature at the accession origin and decreased with the accession-specific seed weight. At the species level, seed longevity differed among plant families but was unrelated to seed weight or seed chemical composition. 4. Synthesis. Our findings highlight substantial within-species variation in seed longevity in storage, which, however, is difficult to predict beyond species identity.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Improving drought tolerance through variety selection requires a deeper understanding of plant ecophysiological responses, but large-scale phenotyping remains a bottleneck. This study assessed the potential of high-throughput tools (spectroscopy and poro-fluorometry) to predict leaf morphological and ecophysiological traits in a grapevine diversity panel grown in pots under well-watered outdoor conditions and under three contrasting soil water treatments in a greenhouse. We found a certain complementarity between measuring devices. Spectrometers could accurately predict leaf mass per area, water content, and water quantity (R2 > 0.58), while the poro-fluorometer was efficient for predicting net CO2 assimilation (R2 > 0.72), regardless of the water treatment. The prediction of leaf mass per area using spectrometers appeared to be quite robust across both outdoor and greenhouse experiments, while the prediction of water use efficiency was dependent on the water treatment, with much better predictions under moderate (R2 > 0.73) than severe water deficit. Calibrated models were then applied to the full diversity panel using only high-throughput measurements to estimate trait values and their broad-sense heritability. Leaf mass per area, also measured directly, showed similar heritability whether based on observed or predicted data. Heritability estimates for predicted traits reached up to 0.5. Overall, our findings support the use of spectroscopy and poro-fluorometry as reliable, non-destructive tools for high-throughput phenotyping, enabling genetic studies on drought-related traits in grapevine.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Neural phase-locking to amplitude-modulated (AM) sounds interacted with time, such that phase-locking longitudinally increased stronger for 40 compared with 4 Hz. In the spatial listening task, the benefit of performing the task with the CI on vs. off was most pronounced when the CI ear was primarily exposed to target speech. Lateralized alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) reliably marked CI users focus of spatial attention. Stronger alpha modulation in the hemisphere opposite to the non-implanted ear indicates an attentional bias toward the acoustically hearing ear.

One physiological system with pronounced differences between the sexes is the immune system: the immune response in humans differs between sexes and results in differential susceptibility of males and females to autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and infectious diseases. However, much remains to be discovered about the mechanisms underlying these sex-based differences in immunity. Here, we use the Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, as a model to investigate sex differences in cellular immunity and determine the underlying mechanisms. We find that, in line with their smaller body size, males have smaller lymph glands than females that contain fewer blood progenitors and produce less immune cells. Single cell RNA-seq analysis of the lymph gland showed that they expressed that sex determination genes and identified substantial sex-specific differences in gene expression. By manipulating the sexual identity of different cell types in the lymph gland we show that a subset of these sex differences are controlled by organ-intrinsic mechanisms involving the hematopoietic niche. Importantly, we find a differential response between males and females to changes in insulin signaling, an important regulator of the immune response in the niche. Finally, we provide evidence for differences in the cellular immune response following infection between males and females.

Despite their importance as integrated indicators of plant responses to environmental shifts, community-level adaptations of fine root traits to global climate and soil nutrient gradients remain poorly understood. This study synthesizes data from 301 natural communities worldwide to examine the mechanisms driving fine root trait variation across different community types. Our findings demonstrate distinct regulatory pathways: precipitation negatively correlates with root tissue density, reflecting optimized resource capture in humid environments, whereas in arid regions, higher root tissue density enhances resilience by increasing structural stability and prolonging root lifespan to cope with resource scarcity. Additionally, temperature-driven phosphorus limitation reduces root phosphorus content. Soil nutrient enrichment promotes thinner roots and elevated specific root length, indicative of autonomous nutrient acquisition strategies, while nutrient scarcity favors thicker roots and reduced specific root length, signifying increased mycorrhizal dependence. The divergent patterns of root nitrogen content in relation to soil nitrogen between grasslands and forests suggest that grasslands employ an \"acquisitive\" nutrient acquisition strategy, while forests adopt a more \"conservative\" approach. Principal component analysis reveals coordinated variation in community-level root traits, challenging the universality of the species-level root economics space.

However, in vivo, DLS neuronal responses to sensory stimuli have shown unexpectedly high selectivity, raising questions about the actual degree of input convergence of functional corticostriatal projection on individual striatal cells. Here, we investigated this question by focusing on the projections from different whisker cortical columns, as they overlap in the striatum and are co-active during behavior. Using ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in the DLS and glutamate uncaging for focal stimulations in the barrel cortex, we were able to map the location of presynaptic neurons to individual striatal projection neurons (SPNs). We found that each SPN was innervated by cells located in a small number of whisker cortical columns scattered across the barrel field in the slice. Connectivity of single SPNs with cortical neurons was thus highly discontinuous horizontally, despite the presence of more potential connections. Moreover, connectivity patterns were specific to each cell, with neighboring SPNs sharing few common clusters of presynaptic cells in the cortex. Despite this sparse and distinct innervation of individual SPNs, the projection was topographically organized at the population level. Finally, we found similar innervation patterns for D1- and D2-type SPNs, but observed differences in synaptic strength in their connections with certain cortical layers, notably the associative layer 2/3. Our results suggest that the high convergence of somatosensory inputs to the striatum, enabled by diffuse and overlapping cortical innervation, is accomplished through sparse yet complementary connectivity to individual SPNs.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

We shed light on the testing effect from a multi-level analysis perspective via a combination of cognitive neuroscience experiments (fMRI) and computational modeling. Behaviorally and computationally, only a model incorporating predictive learning can account for the full breadth of behavioral patterns and the robust testing effect. At the neural level, testing and prediction error both activate the canonical reward-related brain areas in the ventral striatum, insula, and midbrain.

This identified a sensor variant, iGABASnFR2, with 4.2-fold improved sensitivity and 20% faster kinetics, and binding affinity that remained in a range sensitive to changes in GABA concentration at synapses.

These improvements yielded a qualitative enhancement of in vivo performance when compared directly to the original sensor. iGABASnFR2 enabled the first measurements of direction-selective GABA release in the retina.

This study presents the first evidence of JEV in Australian piggery effluents/environmental waters, demonstrating the feasibility of effluent and environmental water surveillance for JEV monitoring. Effluent/environmental samples from multiple piggery sites were analyzed using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, revealing the presence of JEV genetic fragments in solid and liquid effluents at three farms, with corresponding clinical cases in some herds. Viral RNA was detected more frequently in solid effluent samples, aligning with previous findings on the partitioning behaviour of mosquito-borne viruses. The detection of JEV in the borrow pit (i.e., a man-made excavation that holds water) water sample highlights potential transmission pathways via mosquito vectors. These findings demonstrate the value of effluent monitoring as an additional tool for JEV surveillance in piggery settings, supporting potential early warning systems and mitigation strategies. Integrating effluent-based monitoring with traditional surveillance approaches could improve livestock industry related disease detection, risk assessments, and response efforts for human and animal health in endemic and emerging regions.

For example, nerve growth factor (NGF), a key inflammatory mediator, fails to induce sensitization of sensory neurons and thermal hyperalgesia in NMRs. This lack of NGF-induced neuronal sensitization and thermal hyperalgesia results from hypofunctional signaling of the NGF receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). Like NGF-TrkA signaling, the neurotrophic factor artemin, a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, is implicated in mediating inflammatory pain through its receptor, GDNF family receptor 3 (GFR3), which is expressed by a subset of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Here we investigated GFR3 expression in DRG neurons of mice and NMRs, as well as measuring the impact of artemin on DRG sensory neuron function in both species in vitro. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed a similar abundance of GFR3 in mouse and NMR DRG sensory neurons, high coexpression with the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel suggesting that these neurons are nociceptive neurons. Using in vitro electrophysiology to record from cultured DRG sensory neurons, we observed that artemin induced depolarization of the resting membrane potential and decreased the rheobase in both species, as well as diminishing the degree of TRPV1 desensitization to multiple capsaicin stimuli.

Given this, we hypothesised that the pharmacokinetics, the temporal changes of drug concentrations under treatment, could impact persister formation. We predicted that the longer bacteria spend under sublethal drug concentrations, the more persisters would form. Using a set-up with small chemostats and the antimicrobial peptide Pexiganan, we indeed found that faster pharmacokinetics resulted in lower persister numbers compared to slower pharmacokinetics.

Here we investigate how a mild electric field (similar in magnitude to that imposed on biological membranes) remodels the nanofibril structure of chitosan hydrogels using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations revealed a novel mechanism of active dewetting, in which the electric field enhances fibrillar order and induces compaction along the sheet-stacking direction through expulsion of water and stabilization of the hydrogen-bond network within and between fibril sheets. This mechanism provides a physical basis for a recent experimental observation that electrodeposited chitosan hydrogel film undergoes vertical contraction. The electric field-induced dewetting between amphiphilic chitosan sheets is reminiscent of but fundamentally different from the classic dewetting phenomenon for purely hydrophobic systems, which has been intensively studied by both theoretical and experimental communities in the past. Using active dewetting to control microstructures has implications for tailored engineering of functional materials such as artificial bones and tissues based on self-assembling chitosan.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

In this study, microbial autotrophs from three diffuse flow hydrothermal vents at Axial Seamount in 2013 and 2014 were isotopically labeled using RNA Stable Isotope Probing (RNA-SIP), targeting subseafloor autotrophic mesophiles (30{degrees}C), thermophiles (55{degrees}C), and hyperthermophiles (80{degrees}C). We constructed taxonomic and functional profiles of active chemolithoautotrophs, examined population distributions across sites, and linked primary producers to their specific metabolic strategies within the subseafloor community. Dominant autotrophs exhibited hydrogen-dependent dissimilatory metabolisms such as sulfur and nitrate reduction and methanogenesis, as well as microaerophilic sulfide oxidation even at 80{degrees}C, consistent with fluid chemistries at each site. While hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea such as Methanothermococcus were restricted in their distribution and activity, hydrogenotrophic sulfur and nitrate reducers from the Aquificota (Thermovibrio), Campylobacterota (Nautiliaceae, Hydrogenimonas, and Desulfurobacteriaceae) were consistently active and present at all sites and years at both the population and community levels. Hydrogenase transcripts were significantly differentially expressed, and diverse hydrogenases were found in metagenome-assembled genomes of Aquificota members, highlighting the importance and versatility of their hydrogen utilization strategies which likely contribute to their cosmopolitan distribution across geochemically disparate subseafloor sites. Together, this study provides new insights into the functional dynamics and distribution of key subseafloor autotrophic microbial communities in young oceanic crust at deep-sea hydrothermal vents.

Using confocal and super-resolution imaging, we characterized the spatial distribution BetaII-spectrin and the assembly pattern of the MPS in human MN axons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discovered a striking gap-and-patch pattern in the medial axon, where sharply demarcated BetaII-spectrin gaps alternate with patches containing a well-organized MPS. The pattern is acutely induced by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine and pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization prevents patch formation, indicating a requirement for actin nucleation in MPS assembly.

Few systems exist where accumulations of chromosomal changes can be studied in the context of morphological innovation. In coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid, cuttlefish), an ancient coleoid chromosomal rearrangement event (ACCRE) has led to a substantial increase in the chromosome number and a new set of chromosomal homologies. Compared to typical molluscan or bilaterian genomes, ACCRE has enabled the origin of many novel regulatory regions in coleoid cephalopods. However, the discrepancies between extant octopodiform (octopus, ~30 chromosomes) and decapodiform (squid and cuttlefish, ~46 chromosomes) karyotypes and the direction of these evolutionary changes remain unexplained. Here we provide a draft genome assembly of the vampire squid Vampyroteuthis sp., the largest cephalopod genome sequenced to-date (over 10 gigabasepairs). Through syntenic comparisons, we infer that this basally branching octopodiform species shows partial retention of the chromosomal complement of Decapodiformes, indicating its more ancestral state and the derived nature of the octopod karyotype. Together with the analysis of a new chromosome-level assembly of the pelagic octopod Argonauta hians, we identified irreversible chromosomal fusion-with-mixing events followed by inter-chromosomal translocations in octopods. We show that this secondary reduction and mixing within octopod chromosomes has enabled the origin of a more entangled genomic configuration, shedding light onto the early evolutionary transitions within the clade.

D.; Pruyne, D.", "abstract": "Background: Actin filament organization in cardiomyocytes critically depends on the formin Fhod3, but a role for Fhod3 in skeletal muscle development has not yet been described. Results: We demonstrate here that in zebrafish mutated for one of two fhod3 paralog genes, fhod3a, skeletal muscle of the trunk appears normal through 2 days post-fertilization, but afterward exhibits myofibril damage, including gaps between myofibrils and myofibril fragmentation. Despite the apparent progressive nature of myofibril damage, fhod3a mutant embryos differ from muscular dystrophy models in that damage is exacerbated by inhibition of muscle activity, and fhod3a mutants show no evidence of sarcolemma disruption. Rather, our results suggest myofibril damage coincides with growth of the skeletal muscle fiber contractile apparatus. We find that neither the second fhod3 paralog, fhod3b, nor the related fhod1 contribute to embryonic skeletal muscle development, but simultaneous mutation of fhod3a and fhod3b was associated with pericardial edema suggestive of cardiac dysfunction. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate fhod3-encoded formins are dispensable for initial myofibril assembly in skeletal muscle, but promote myofibril stability during muscle fiber growth. This is the first demonstration that Fhod3 contributes to skeletal muscle development in a vertebrate.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The medial nucleus accumbens shell (medNAcSh) is increasingly recognized as a key node in the regulation of hedonic feeding, exerting strong control over reward consumption through its projections to downstream structures. Recent studies showed that one of the primary cellular mediators of these effects are dopamine 1 receptor positive striatal projection neurons (D1-SPNs). Specifically, population D1-SPN activity gets inhibited during reward consumption and such inhibition is necessary and sufficient to authorize reward consumption, independent of metabolic need. Anatomically, the medNAcSh spans a 1.5 mm distance along the rostro-caudal axis in mice and previous studies have reported functional gradients along this axis in behavioral control. For instance, classical pharmacological studies have suggested that rostral rather than caudal medNAcSh regulates appetitive behavior. However, the cellular, circuit, and molecular mechanisms underlying this topographical gradient remain unknown. Here we hypothesized that D1-SPNs contribute to this gradient by regulating hedonic feeding via a specific hotspot in the rostral medNAcSh. Using population level calcium monitoring with fiber photometry in mice, we show that rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs demonstrate inhibitory responses during reward consumption, while caudal D1-SPNs do not. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs inhibits consumption, while stimulation of caudal D1-SPNs had minimal effects, confirming the existence of a functional rostro-caudal gradient. Importantly, we observed no differences between rostral and caudal D1-SPNs in their behavioral or activity responses to aversive stimuli, suggesting that the D1-SPN gradient is specific to appetitive contexts. To investigate potential molecular correlates of this functional gradient, we leveraged open-source anatomy datasets and performed fluorescent in situ hybridization, identifying Stard5 and Peg10 as markers enriched in the rostral and caudal medNAcSh, respectively. Finally, we developed a novel Stard5-Flp driver mouse line, which allowed us to target the rostral hotspot selectively. We demonstrated that Stard5+ neurons recapitulate activity patterns of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs. Together, these findings establish a spatially confined rostral subregion of the medNAcSh as a critical regulator of reward consumption and introduce Stard5 as a molecular tool for its manipulation - offering new opportunities for intervention in dysregulated eating beyond classical homeostatic circuits.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Here we develop a naive system based on the predatory ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, not known for hosting symbiont, to recapitulate early events leading to photosymbiosis evolution. T. thermophila was found to readily phagocyte eukaryotic algae (Chlorella variabilis) or cyanobacteria (Synechoccocus elongatus) that can reach high numbers within predatory cells. Feeding with either prey in a low carbon environment provide little or no growth advantage to T. thermophila. In contrast, in anoxic environment, both intracellular C. variabilis or S. elongatus can readily support growth of T. thermophila, in the light but not in the dark, demonstrating that oxygen in hospite supply can be an initial feature supporting further photo-endosymbiosis evolution. This suggests that it is unlikely that carbon metabolites produced by phototrophs could have represented a selective advantage for the evolution of photosymbionts. Although most extant photosymbiosis are based on carbon supply to the host cell, we therefore propose that it is a secondary event occurring from initial evolution in anoxic or hypoxic conditions, where O2 production was crucial for establishing the initial steps of photosymbiosis.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

As thermal tolerance in corals is partially heritable, identifying genes under thermal selection is critical for targeted biodiversity management. However, it remains unclear how large breaks in connectivity (>100 km of open sea) affect the spread of adaptive alleles for different coral species in discontinuous reef networks such as the West Indian Ocean (WIO). To address this, we applied a seascape genomics approach to model (i) population connectivity and (ii) thermal adaptive potentials for two keystone coral species, Acropora muricata and Pocillopora damicornis, across the WIO. For both species, corals from the Seychelles were predominantly genetically isolated from corals in Rodrigues and Mauritius, putatively an effect of regional oceanographic barriers. Furthermore, sea currents during reproductive periods better predicted genetic connectivity than did Euclidean distances for both species, highlighting that connectivity models can serve as proxies to understand dispersal potential depending on reproductive strategies. Spatial patterns of neutral genetic variation were best explained by sea surface temperature variability and mean degree heating weeks. When used in genotype-environment association (GEA) analyses, we identified hundreds of loci under putative thermal selection from linked to known heat stress responses. In A. muricata, five Sacsin genes-co-chaperones of the Hsp70 heat-shock protein involved in thermal stress response-were identified, alongside genes related to immune defence, antioxidant response, signalling, and protein folding. In contrast, only the centromere protein V, involved in mitosis, was enriched in P. damicornis. By integrating patterns of gene flow with molecular adaptations to estimate species-specific adaptive potentials, we found that large sea distances and strong oceanographic barriers inhibit the genetic exchange of adapted genotypes across the WIO, providing valuable insights to guide local and regional biodiversity management in this region.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

We assembled high-quality genomes of three founder pathotypes of Pl. halstedii. Performing comparative genomic analyses, population genetics, and phylogenomic analyses, we studied the genomic structure among the 16 reference French pathotypes of Pl. halstedii. We revealed a conserved genomic organisation among pathotypes and a strong synteny with other Peronosporales species. The history of Pl. halstedii invasion in France over the last 60 years was documented by identifying founder strains and their admixture patterns.

In Indonesia, where plastic pollution is severe, no validated tool exists to assess public plastic use patterns and MP awareness in relation to cognitive health.\n\nObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive questionnaire evaluating plastic consumption behaviors, MP knowledge, attitudes, and their association with cognitive function in Indonesian adults.\n\nMaterial and methodsA cross-sectional pilot study was conducted with 30 participants (80% female, mean age 37.4{+/-}13.7 years). The questionnaire was developed through literature review, expert consultation, and focus group discussions, covering six domains: demographics, health history, MP knowledge, plastic use behaviors, environmental attitudes, and cognitive screening (AD-8). Validity was assessed using Pearsons correlation, and reliability was measured via Cronbachs alpha.\n\nResultThe questionnaire demonstrated strong validity for knowledge (r=0.379, p=0.039), behavior (r=0.726, p<0.001), and attitude sections (r=0.385, p=0.036), with acceptable reliability (=0.623). Neurocognitive assessment revealed significantly lower AD-8 scores in participants with cognitive decline (mean=11.14) versus normal cognition (mean=18.03, p=0.038). Key findings included high single-use plastic consumption, limited awareness of MP regulations (70% uninformed), and an attitude-behavior gap in mitigation efforts.\n\nDiscussionThe tool effectively identified MP knowledge gaps and behavioral risks while suggesting a plausible link between plastic exposure and cognitive impairment. The AD-8s sensitivity and specificity supported its utility for screening, though the modest sample size limited statistical power for correlation analyses.\n\nConclusionThis validated questionnaire provides a critical foundation for assessing MP-related cognitive risks in Indonesia. Future studies should expand validation in larger cohorts and investigate causal mechanisms.

We show here that enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells that evade senescence mis-segregate chromosomes due to defective chromosomal alignment and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, leading to aneuploidy and DNA damage. The chromosome alignment errors are associated with impaired Sgo1 localisation to centromeres and defective sister chromatin cohesion during mitosis.

Despite extensive study in complex tissues, the minimal mechanical requirements driving intercalation remain poorly understood due to confounding tissue level interactions. Here, we present a novel morphogenesis-on-chip assay utilizing micropatterned cell quadruplets. This system isolates the elementary unit of intercalation while enabling quantitative force and shape measurements. Cross-shaped micropatterns generate stable four cell configurations in MDCK epithelial cells. Surprisingly, these cells spontaneously undergo T1 transitions autonomously. We combined live imaging with force inference and traction force microscopy, which revealed that intercalation emerges from two distinct mechanisms: interfacial tension dynamics and differential cell migration. Specifically, we show a correlation between central junction shrinkage and increased relative tension. Similarly, we show a correlation between central junction shrinkage and migratory forces. We successfully adapted the assay to Xenopus mesoderm cells, revealing conserved mechanical principles across cell types. Furthermore, experimentally derived effective energy landscapes closely match theoretical vertex model predictions, and suggest a dominant role for migratory forces in driving intercalation. This confirms that our minimal system recapitulates the fundamental physics of intercalation.

The design sustains an effective NA 0.87 over a contiguous 6 x 6 mm{superscript 2} FOV at high speed (2,048 x 2,048 pixels at 7.67 Hz). The modular platform can be upgraded with optional modules for simultaneous multi-plane imaging (1-4 planes at full resolution and speed), volumetric imaging (6 x 6 x 0.5 mm3, 2,048 x 2,048 x 28 voxels at 1 Hz capturing > 210,000 neurons), and holographic two-photon optogenetic stimulation for targeted perturbations. To handle the resulting large-scale data, we provide an open-source deep-learning pipeline that automates motion correction, segmentation, and spike inference. We demonstrate cortex-wide sensory responses, layer-specific network synchrony during anaesthesia, and in-vivo tracking of micro- and nanoplastic distribution. Meso2P therefore provides a reproducible route to high-throughput volumetric imaging across almost the entire cortex with high detection efficiency.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Although clinical studies have suggested advantages of RETS transfer for upper extremity repairs, uncertainties remain regarding its underlying mechanism. Furthermore, our recent clinical studies using electrophysiological examinations revealed no contribution from the donor nerve. Given that most experimental studies were conducted on acutely injured nerves, our objective is to reassess the effectiveness of reverse end-to-side nerve transfer in a model of chronic nerve injury and repair. Methods Obturator and femoral nerve were used as donor and recipient nerves, respectively. Electromyogram (EMG), retrograde labeling of regenerated motoneurons and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation were used to compare regenerative ability of donor nerve in acute and delayed RETS transfer where the femoral nerve in the latter group was injured 8 weeks prior. Nerve- babysitting effect on injured nerve was investigated by 1) no intervention; 2) perineurial window creation; and 3) RETS transfer to femoral nerve in delayed repair model. The effects of availability of regeneration tracks, i.e. bands of bungner, were investigated by severing proximal femoral nerve with subsequent acute and delayed repairs. Results EMG and motoneuron quantification confirmed inferiority of donor nerve regeneration into recipient nerve in delayed RETS transfer compared to acute repair, yet donor axons reached target muscle and formed NMJs in both conditions. Same functional assessments revealed nerve baby-sitting effects did not significantly contribute to repair success but availability of regeneration tracks in the recipient nerve may influence the final outcomes. Conclusions Our study offered insights into the effectiveness of RETS nerve transfer in clinically relevant settings, underscoring the compounded impact of delayed intervention and native nerve regeneration which both negatively affect the efficacy of RETS nerve transfer.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Yet, how distinct facets of this variability evolve from childhood to older adulthood remains poorly understood, limiting mechanistic models of neurocognitive aging. Here, we characterize lifespan neural variability using an integrated empirical-computational approach. We analyzed high-density EEG cohort data spanning 111 healthy individuals aged 9-75 years, recorded at rest and during passive and attended auditory oddball stimulation task. We extracted scale-dependent measures of EEG fluctuations amplitude and entropy, together with millisecond-resolved phase-synchrony networks in the 2-20 Hz range. Multi-condition partial least squares decomposition analysis revealed two independent lifespan trajectories. First, slow-frequency power, variance and complexity at longer timescales declined monotonically with age, indicating a progressive dampening of low-frequency fluctuations and large-scale coherence. Second, the temporal organization of phase-synchrony reconfigurations followed an inverted U-trend: young adults exhibited the slowest yet most diverse switching--characterized by low mean but high variance and low kurtosis of jump lengths at 2-6 Hz and the opposite pattern at 8-20 Hz--whereas children and older adults showed faster, more stereotyped dynamics. To mechanistically account for these patterns, we fitted a ten-node phase-oscillator model constrained by the human structural connectome. Only an intermediate, metastable coupling regime reproduced the empirical combination of reduced low-frequency variability and maximally heterogeneous synchrony dynamics observed in young adults, while deviations toward weaker or stronger coupling mimicked the childrens and older adults profiles. Our results demonstrate that development and aging entail changes in the switching dynamics of EEG phase synchronization, by differentially sculpting stationary and transient aspects of neural variability. This establishes time-resolved phase-synchrony metrics as sensitive, mechanistically grounded markers of neurocognitive status across the lifespan.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

EccDNA populations exhibit immense diversity and a characteristically low degree of overlap between samples, suggesting low inherence of eccDNA between cells or a deficiency the methods by which eccDNA is detected. This study revisits the Circle-seq approach for enrichment of eccDNA to address if these limitations, hypothesizing that experimental procedures significantly contribute to the observed low eccDNA overlap. We optimized the protocol by reducing the time. Linear DNA is digested by increasing exonuclease V activity. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 for mitochondrial linearization, which proved superior to restriction enzymes. A key finding is the critical role of random hexamer primer concentration and genomic DNA input in Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) for generating high-quality long amplicons from eccDNA (concatemeric tandem copy, CTC), essential for confident de novo eccDNA construction from long-read sequencing data. Lower primer concentrations substantially increased the percentage of CTC-derived eccDNA and improved the overlap of identified eccDNAs in technical replicates. Applying this revisited approach to human myeloma and breast cancer cell lines, as well as xenograft models, demonstrated that the optimized conditions enhanced the overlap of detected eccDNA up to over 50% overlap which substantially improved over previous studies (less than 1%).

Although phased out in the early 2000s, their chemical persistence, recycling into new materials, and leaching from waste sites have led to ongoing environmental contamination and widespread human exposure--especially through diet and indoor dust. This is particularly concerning for developing individuals, who not only accumulate the highest levels via placental transfer, breastfeeding, and behavioral factors, but are also especially vulnerable to long-term effects. Despite well-documented impacts of developmental PBDE exposure on neurobehavioral, endocrine, and metabolic systems, the effects on the immune system remain comparatively underexplored. To begin addressing this gap, we focused on mast cells-- innate immune cells well-positioned to contribute to the multisystemic effects of developmental exposures. Mast cells are long-lived, tissue-resident cells enriched at barrier surfaces and perivascular sites throughout the body, including the brain. Their widespread distribution, extensive receptor repertoire, and unique ability to store and rapidly release bioactive mediators from cytoplasmic granules position them as key modulators of immune, endocrine, and nervous system function. Using oral exposure to two doses of a PBDE mixture throughout pregnancy and lactation in mice, here we show that maternal exposure to [~]87 g/kg/day--aligned with the lower end of doses known to affect metabolic and neurobehavioral outcomes in preclinical models, and within 10-fold of levels measured in human serum and placenta--leads to persistent dysfunction in mast cell mediator release in adult male and female offspring. This was evidenced by blunted anaphylaxis-associated hypothermia and plasma histamine release in vivo. These deficits were not due to changes in tissue-resident mast cell numbers, but rather to an impaired capacity to sustain histamine release over time. Studies in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) revealed that histamine synthesis was intact, but granule maturation and stimulus-induced calcium mobilization were disrupted, in association with downregulation of genes such as IGF2R, ITGA4, ITGB6, and NGFR. Given that the bone marrow is the primary postnatal source of mast cells, these findings suggest that PBDEs induce lasting reprogramming at the level of hematopoietic progenitors--with broad implications not only for mast cell function across tissues, but potentially for other immune cell lineages as well. In sum, this study provides the first evidence that developmental exposure to PBDEs induces long-lasting impairments in mast cell functions, suggesting a previously unrecognized mechanism by which early-life exposure to environmental toxicants could contribute to persistent physiological and behavioral dysfunctions", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Proteomic and electrophysiological characterization at different developmental time points showed that these neurons gain a proteomic profile that maps to different cortical interneuron subtypes, particularly VIP+ interneurons, and display typical GABAergic synaptic properties, producing large, synchronous and picrotoxin-sensitive currents. During early development synaptic strength increased threefold, which was accompanied by enhanced expression of multiple GABA-specific presynaptic gene sets, but few changes in postsynaptic gene sets. Synaptic strength continued to improve during late development but with only minor proteomic changes. Co-seeding with NGN2 neurons created stable networks of predefined excitation/inhibition ratios, with corresponding synapse ratios.

These flavored products include constituents such as propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin (PG/VG), benzoic acid, acetoin, L-menthone, 98% menthone, 2-isopropyl-N,2,3-trimethylbutanamide (WS-23), vanillin, and carvone. However, little is known about the potential adverse effects of the constituents in these flavored products. Rationale and hypothesis: We hypothesized that exposure to common constituents in tobacco- and menthol-flavored ENDS constituents could elicit a lung-injurious response mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (-nAChR or CHRNA) modulation. Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, cells were treated with commonly used menthol and tobacco constituents on trans well inserts. Transepithelial barrier resistance (TEER) and millivolts (mV) across epithelial cells were measured over a 24-hour time. To assess the elicited inflammatory response, cytokines IL8 and IL6 were quantified in the conditioned media. Cytotoxicity caused by these constituents was evaluated by acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) staining of the cells after 24 hrs. alpha nicotinic receptor protein abundance (1, 4, 5, and 7) was quantified by immunoblotting. Results: Epithelial integrity was decreased over time with a significant decrease in TEER and voltage by ENDS constituents. A significant increase in IL6 in conditioned media was observed in PG/VG, carvone, and WS-23 treated cells. Carvone-treated cells also elicited significantly elevated IL8 in conditioned media. Further, increased 1, 4, 5, and 7 nAChR were seen in cells treated with PG/VG, Acetoin, Carvone, and WS-23. Conclusion: These findings suggested that common constituents in menthol- and tobacco-flavored ENDS induce lung inflammation, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and lung injury. Further, our data implicate potential lung disease pathogenesis via nAChR modulation-mediated inflammation by exposure to these ENDS constituents, even in the absence of nicotine.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

We identified potential exit vectors and used the most promising ligand as a building block to prepare bifunctional degraders in the form of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs). Although ternary complex formation was successful in vitro, degradation of BRD4 was not observed, highlighting the need for further optimization of the degraders.

Multi-omics integration reveals that nutrient limitation triggers global metabolic reprogramming, promoting sulfur assimilation, biofilm formation, and chemotaxis-linked persister-like adaptation. Substrate-specific transcriptomics identified a temporally regulated protease repertoire tightly coordinated with sulfitolytic activity, facilitating efficient feather decomposition under starvation. Protein-protein interaction networks uncovered stress-responsive transcriptional regulators that govern this process. Time-resolved gene expression analysis and metabolomic profiling further revealed that cyclic-di-GMP signaling, stringent response, and flagella assembly mediate transitions between motility and sessile growth, contributing to surface colonization and persistence.

However, due to logistical challenges of sampling such species throughout their distribution across steep and varied terrains, studies often lack comprehensive evidence to understand patterns of population divergence, local adaptation, and how current adaptations may influence future vulnerability. In this study, we utilized the Tibetan Partridge (Perdix hodgsoniae), a high-altitude endemic bird found between 2800 and 5000 meters across the arid western and humid northeastern regions of the Sino-Himalayan landscape. This regions complex topography-characterized by tall mountains, deep valleys, and contrasting climatic conditions provided opportunities for investigating population divergence, local adaptation, and climate-related vulnerability. We integrated population-scale whole-genome sequencing with ecological, climatic, landscape, and morphological data to examine current patterns of local adaptation and forecast future risks. Our findings show that both biogeographic barriers and climatic variation drive rapid population divergence in P. hodgsoniae, reflected in distinct morphological traits and population genetic structure. Western populations, inhabiting dry and fragmented landscapes, exhibit adaptations to temperature extremes with low genetic diversity, reduced habitat suitability, limited gene flow, and weak connectivity, factors that increase their vulnerability to future environmental changes. In contrast, northeastern populations, living in more humid regions, show genetic adaptations linked to precipitation, maintain high genetic diversity and habitat connectivity, and may serve as evolutionary refugia under future climate scenarios.

Effectively learning spatial representations is crucial for downstream analyses and requires robust integration of spatial information with transcriptomic data. While existing methods have shown promise, they often fail to adequately capture both local (neighbor-level) and global (tissue-wide) spatial contexts. Moreover, they tend to rely heavily on augmentation strategies, which can introduce noise and instability. Objectives: This study aims to introduce and demonstrate a novel, versatile framework called GatorST, which explicitly combines graph-based modeling with advanced learning strategies to generate spatially informed representations of ST data. GatorST is designed to improve various downstream tasks, including identification of spatial domains, gene expression imputation, batch effect removal, and trajectory inference. Methods: GatorST constructs a spot-spot graph by connecting each node to its k nearest spatial neighbors and extracts two-hop neighborhood subgraphs to capture local context. At the global level, gene expression profiles are clustered using soft K-means to generate pseudo-labels, which serve as weak supervision signals within a contrastive learning framework. This process encourages the alignment of embeddings with shared pseudo-labels while separating those with different labels. GatorST further adopts an episodic training strategy inspired by meta-learning, wherein each episode consists of a support set for contrastive optimization and a disjoint query set for embedding classification, guided by the pseudo-labeled data. This design enables the model to classify unseen samples based on learned embeddings, thereby enhancing its generalization to new spatial contexts. Results: Comprehensive comparisons with fifteen state-of-the-art methods across fourteen spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that GatorST consistently achieves superior performance in identifying spatial domains, imputing gene expressions, and removing batch effects. The results showcase the versatility and strong generalization capabilities of GatorST across diverse tissue types and experimental settings. Conclusion: GatorST effectively integrates spatial topology and global gene expression through graph-based modeling, pseudo-labeling, and contrastive meta-learning. This framework generates biologically meaningful representations and significantly improves key downstream tasks, including spatial domain identification, gene expression imputation, batch effect removal, and trajectory inference.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Conflicts were classified as either economic, health, environmental or social, further divided into 32 subcategories. We applied a Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS), whereby individual conflicts were scored on a scale of 1-5 (minimal to highest known impact); these were used to determine the potential impact (sum of all conflicts) and actual impact (sum of all conflicts corrected for geographical distribution) of individual mammals so they could be ranked on their level of impact. Forty-eight mammals were involved in a total of 200 separate conflicts. The highest ranked conflicts (scoring 5) were all measurable on an economic scale (involving rabbit, badger, brown rat and grey squirrel). We estimated a conservative annual economic cost of human-wildlife conflicts in excess of {pound}0.5 billion, which could exceed {pound}1 billion if health and environmental conflicts could be monetarised. The most common conflicts were health related (reservoir of disease and zoonotic disease), although generally, health conflicts were scored low (mostly 1 or 2). Overall, there was no statistical difference in impact score depending on status (native or non-native); however, when considered by subcategory, non-native species scored higher in relation to damage to woodland, agricultural interests and property, and reservoir of zoonotic disease, whilst native species caused more conflict with construction and development, and predation of livestock. Non-native species had a higher potential impact score compared to native species, but not actual impact. However, actual impact was predicted to increase, relative to population size, at a higher rate for non-native species compared to native, highlighting the need for surveillance and monitoring. Where mammals represent a cost to some, they may provide a benefit to others, e.g. fox predation of rabbits, and as such may require a holistic approach to management. We concluded that a GISS approach is a useful tool for identifying conflict species and could form part of a package of measures to ensure a balance between the need to conserve and enhance biodiversity, whilst also considering the interests of those directly affected by human-wildlife conflict, is achieved.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the sequence-resolved genomic architecture of 135 chromosome 22q11.2 haplotypes from diverse 1000 Genomes Project samples. We find that more than 90% of the copy number variation is polarized to the most proximal LCR region A (LCRA) where 50 distinct structural configurations are observed (~189 kbp to ~2.15 Mbp or 11-fold length variation). A higher-order SD cassette structure of 105 kbp in length, flanked by 25 kbp long inverted repeats, drives this variation and emerged in the human-chimpanzee ancestral lineage later expanding in humans ~1.0 [0.8-1.2] million years ago. African LCRA haplotypes are significantly longer (p=0.0047) when compared to non-Africans yet are predicted to be more protected against recurrent microdeletions (p=0.00053) due to a preponderance of flanking SDs in an inverted orientation. Conversely, we identified nine distinct inversion polymorphisms, including five recurrent ~2.28 Mbp inversions extending across the critical region (LCRA-D) and four smaller inversions (two LCRA-B, one LCRC-D, and one LCRB-D); 7/9 of these events were identified in haplotypes of African and admixed American ancestry. Finally, we sequence and assemble four families and show that LCRA-D deletion breakpoints map to the 105 kbp repeat unit while inversion breakpoints associate with the 25 kbp repeats adjacent to palindromic AT-rich regions. In one family, we observe evidence of more complex unequal crossover events associated with gene conversion and multiple breakpoints. Our findings suggest that specific haplotype configurations are protective and susceptible to chromosome 22q11.2DS while recurrent large-scale inversions help to explain why this syndrome is less prevalent among individuals of African descent.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Specifically, it was aimed to identify major cortical sources of information flow and target regions of information influx, and to reveal which frequency-specific oscillatory networks are critically involved in directing information flux in experienced meditators. Multivariate Granger causality (GC) was computed from high-resolution EEG signals recorded from long-term (LTM, n = 22) and short-term meditators (STM, n = 17) in four conditions: rest, Focused Attention Meditation, Open Monitoring Meditation, and Loving Kindness Meditation. GC was analyzed in the time and frequency domains to assess frequency-specific networks supporting the directed connectivity between key cortical regions (frontal and parietal) in the two hemispheres. According to the results, long-practice meditation was characterized by a significant increase of information flow (1) from posterior to frontal cortical regions, and (2) across frontal regions of the two hemispheres. These dominant transfers were supported by multi-spectral oscillatory networks involving theta, alpha and beta frequency bands, with most prominent expression of GC alpha peak. This pattern of enhanced information transfer in LTM relative to STM was observed in both resting state and each meditation state. These results suggest that long-term meditation is associated with a shift in resting-state brain dynamics toward reduced reliance on slow, undirected intrinsic oscillations, and enhanced directional connectivity in frequencies linked to attention and cognitive control. The dominant posterior-to-anterior directionality points to a reorganization of cognitive control networks that may support the phenomenological qualities of extensive meditation (sustained attention, internal attention, present-moment awareness, and reduced cognitive elaboration). The similarity of between-group differences in directionality patterns across states points to a neuroplastic effect of long-term meditation and highlights meditation as a potential model for investigating adaptive neuroplasticity in large-scale brain networks.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

We evaluated the level of motion, reliability and stability of RSFC measures in each participant and contrasted these measures between the PD and HC groups, as well as compared to a conventional 5 minutes of RSFC data. In addition, we created individualized brain network measures in PD participants to establish feasibility in this population. Results: Using precision methods, the PD group produced reliable and stable RSFC measures of brain networks of similar quality to healthy controls and substantially better than conventional methods. Individualized network maps from individuals with PD demonstrate differences from group averages and from each other, including in key motor systems. Conclusion: Precision RSFC is feasible and reliable in individuals with PD. This approach holds promise for advancing personalized diagnostics and identifying brain-based biomarkers underlying clinical variability in PD.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Recent work has demonstrated highly accurate intracortical BCIs for speech and cursor control, but two critical capabilities needed for practical viability were unmet: independent at-home operation without researcher assistance, and reliable long-term performance supporting accurate speech and cursor decoding. Here, we demonstrate the independent and near-daily use of a multimodal BCI with novel brain-to-text speech and computer cursor decoders by a man with paralysis and severe dysarthria due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Over nearly two years, the participant used the BCI for more than 3,800 cumulative hours to maintain rich interpersonal communication with his family and friends, independently control his personal computer, and sustain full-time employment -- despite being paralyzed. He communicated 183,060 sentences -- totaling 1,960,163 words -- at an average rate of 56.1 words per minute. He labeled 92.3% of sentences as being decoded at least mostly correctly. In formal quantifications of performance where he was asked to say words presented on a screen, attempted speech was consistently decoded with over 99% word accuracy (125,000 word vocabulary). The participant also used the speech BCI as keyboard input and the cursor BCI as mouse input to control his personal computer, enabling him to send text messages, emails, and to browse the internet. These results demonstrate that intracortical BCIs have the potential to support independent use in the home, marking a critical step toward practical assistive technology for people with severe motor impairment.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether cortical intrinsic neural timescales (INT), a measure of temporal stability in neural activity, are altered in adolescents with MDD and whether these alterations relate to clinical symptoms, suicidality, early life adversity, and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Using resting state fMRI in adolescents with MDD and healthy controls (HCs), we found widespread reductions in INT in frontal, parietal, and sensorimotor regions, with a notable prolongation in the left temporoparietal junction. Disrupted timescales significantly impaired network modularity and clustering, and SVR based machine learning revealed that altered INT patterns predicted individual depression and anxiety severity. INT abnormalities were further associated with suicidal ideation and childhood trauma, particularly emotional and physical neglect. Biophysical modeling linked INT variations to local recurrent excitation and external input strength, differing between HCs and MDD. Spatial correlations with PET derived neurotransmitter receptor maps demonstrated that INT alterations colocalize with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic systems. Transcriptomic enrichment analysis revealed associations with genes involved in mitochondrial function, synaptic signaling, and metabolic regulation. Together, these findings identify neural timescale disruption as a core pathophysiological feature of adolescent MDD, bridging macroscale dynamics with microcircuit and molecular architecture.

A key component underlying this process is structural inference. This computation determines the syntactic category ('head') of phrases, such as noun phrases (NP) and verb phrases (VP). Categorization confers distinct semantic and distributional properties. However, isolating neural correlates of structural inference is challenging, as modulations of syntactic category usually alter lexical content. Here, we collected the electroencephalography (EEG) data while participants read Mandarin NPs and VPs, which differ in their syntactic 'headedness' but with lexical-semantics, lexical-syntactic categories and word order strictly conserved. We found significant theta power increases at left central-parietal scalp sites in NPs relative to VPs around the presentation (0-210 ms) of the nouns, where only the nouns in NPs project a head. Both NPs and VPs relative to one-word phrases exhibited spatiotemporally consistent low-frequency power increases at the point of linguistic composition, consistent with previous studies. Overall, our findings offer novel constraints on neurocomputational accounts of linguistic structure-building through these previously undocumented signatures of syntactic inference.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Education, a known protective factor against age-related decline in cognitive performance, has been largely overlooked in studies linking aperiodic EEG components to cognition. This study addresses this gap, hypothesizing that education moderates the interplay between age, aperiodic components, and cognitive performance, as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. We reanalyzed an open-source EEG dataset of 714 healthy individuals aged 18-91 years using Generalized Additive Mixed Models. Aperiodic exponent and offset both declined with age, but higher education levels mitigated these declines. Notably, exponent and offset interacted with age and education in predicting MMSE performance in the bilateral cingulate, left hippocampus, bilateral parietal, right occipital, and left temporal regions. Among older adults, the relationship between the aperiodic components and cognitive performance diverged by education: those with lower education showed worse cognitive outcomes with lower exponents and offsets, whereas higher-educated individuals after 60 years showed a reverse pattern, with lower exponents and offsets predicting better MMSE performance. Our findings suggest that the link between aperiodic components and cognitive aging is not straightforward but depends on moderating factors such as education. These results underscore the importance of accounting for individual differences, like educational background, when exploring age-related changes in EEG aperiodic components and cognition.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

This study evaluated the seroprevalence and associated risk factors for T. gondii infection in domestic and synanthropic animals from two low-income communities in Salvador, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the neighborhoods of Marechal Rondon and Pau da Lima from October 2021 to February 2023. Blood samples were collected from domestic animals (288 dogs, 112 cats, 27 chickens, and six horses) and synanthropic species (54 brown rats and 75 big-eared opossums). Serological tests were performed using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test. Questionnaires were used to collect environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic data from households where sampling took place. Generalized linear mixed models were applied to identify predictors of exposure. Seroprevalence was highest in chickens (66.7%), followed by dogs (37.2%), rats (24.1%), cats (22.3%), opossums (20%), and horses (16.7%). No significant factors were found to be associated with T. gondii seroprevalence in chickens, horses, rats, or opossums. Nevertheless, in dogs and cats, homemade diets increased the odds of infection by nearly six times compared to commercial feeding. Dogs from Pau da Lima were twice as likely to be infected as those from Marechal Rondon.

Current methods for estimating ancestry-specific allele frequencies typically rely on \"best-guess\" ancestry and genotype calls, thereby ignoring uncertainty from these upstream ancestry calling and genotyping procedures. Here, we introduce LoGicAl, a novel method for estimating ancestry-specific allele frequencies via accelerated expectation-maximization algorithm while simultaneously accounting for uncertainty from ancestry calling, genotyping, and statistical phasing to fine-tune its estimates. Simulation and real data applications demonstrate that ignoring these uncertainties inflates bias in allele frequency estimates and show that LoGicAl has superior accuracy and scalability in leveraging sequencing and array genotyping with different levels of local ancestry inference quality.

Despite its pivotal role in reproductive health, the cellular states and interactions that coordinate this process are incompletely defined. Here, we establish an in vitro menstrual cycle (IVMC) protocol using human endometrial organoids that faithfully recapitulates the epithelium across the key phases of the menstrual cycle including differentiation, hormonal withdrawal, breakdown and regeneration. This IVMC protocol enables intricate study of the early phases of the cycle, which remain difficult to access in vivo. Using this system, we define transcriptional transitions in ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells during regeneration, revealing immediate stress-responsive states followed by wound-responsive ones that precede proliferation. We demonstrate that, in response to breakdown, organoids acquire a transcriptomic signature resembling the in vivo luminal epithelium in the menstrual and proliferative phases of the cycle. Luminal epithelial cells are crucial for this re-epithelialization and express factors such as WNT7A which we show to be required for long-term epithelial maintenance. Moreover, cell cell communication analyses identify luminal epithelium as a signaling hub, interacting with endothelial and immune cells via pathways including CXCL8, consistent with promotion of angiogenesis and immune recruitment during the regenerative window.

While this catalog represented a starting point for reference ncORF annotation, major technical and scientific issues remained. In particular, this initial catalogue had no standardized framework to judge the evidence of translation for individual ncORFs. Here, we present an expanded and refined catalog of the human reference annotation of ncORFs. By incorporating more datasets and by lifting constraints on ORF length and start-codon, we define a comprehensive set of 28,359 ncORFs that is nearly four times the size of the previous catalog. Furthermore, to aid users who wish to work with ncORFs with the strongest and most reproducible signals of translation, we utilized a data-driven framework (i.e. translation signature scores) to assess the accumulated evidence for any individual ncORF. Using this approach, we derive a subset of 7,888 ncORFs with translation evidence on par with canonical protein-coding genes, which we refer to as the Primary set. This set can serve as a reliable reference for downstream analyses and validation, with a particular emphasis on high quality.

Early life forms, including prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes, mostly display random configurations. Through the evolution of plants, global folding became the prominent architecture with eudicots and remained dominant. Animals, however, progressively developed stronger checkerboard throughout vertebrate and invertebrate evolution, and even during early embryogenesis, suggesting a conserved gene co-regulation mechanism.

It is unclear how RdDM is initiated and established in endosperm. Rice endosperm-specific imprinted chromatin remodeler OsCLSY3 recruits RNA polymerase IV to specific genomic sites for silencing and optimal gene expression. Here we show that, in addition to OsCLSY3, ubiquitously expressed OsCLSY4 is also crucial for proper reproductive growth and endosperm development. Loss of function of OsCLSY4 led to reproductive and nutrient-filling defects in endosperm. Using genetic and molecular analysis, we show that OsCLSY3 and OsCLSY4 play both overlapping and unique silencing roles in rice endosperm by targeting specific and common TEs, repeats and genic regions. These results indicate the importance of optimal expression of two OsCLSYs in regulating endosperm-specific gene expression, genomic imprinting and suppression of specific TEs.

These are involved in diverse processes across the entire cell cycle, including DNA replication, chromosome condensation, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and the metaphase-anaphase transition. We demonstrate that CKS enhances CDK activity to drive phosphorylation of sites with low affinity for CDK. This acts both on specific substrates, likely by stabilizing CDK-substrate interactions, and through control of overall CDK activity, by regulating its interaction with Wee1 and Cdc25.

Our data set encompasses 83 of the 87 known extant species and six Limenitis species that were recently excluded from Adelpha (134 of c. 160 subspecies in total), collectively displaying 14 distinct mimicry patterns.

CFTR-targeting therapies such as ivacaftor have transformed CF care by directly modulating CFTR function. However, the precise mechanism by which ivacaftor alters CFTR's conformational dynamics remains incompletely understood. In this study, we refined and employed a CFTR model derived from the phosphorylated, ATP- and ivacaftor-bound cryo-EM structure (PDB ID 6O2P). Through 32.5 microseconds of molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the structural and dynamic effects of the common F508del mutation and the gating mutations G551D, G1349D, and S549N. Our results show that mutations within the ATP-binding regions cause local rearrangements at the nucleotide-binding sites, affecting the interface between the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) relative to wild-type CFTR, rather than abolishing ATP binding entirely. We further indicate that, for the NBDs to approach one another productively, protonation of the aspartate side chains in G551D and G1349D CFTR may be necessary to mitigate charge repulsion. The F508del mutation induces increased rigidity within the protein core, impeding the rearrangement of transmembrane helices required for channel opening. Ivacaftor does not directly perturb the ATP-binding sites, consistent with emerging evidence that it exerts its effects allosterically on regions distal to the nucleotide-binding sites.

We demonstrate that overexpression of predominantly nuclear wildtype TDP-43, cytoplasm-targeted TDP-43, and an ALS-linked variant (G294V) each induce toxic gain-of-function effects, leading to impaired motor function, motor neuron loss, and muscle atrophy. Importantly, these models reveal distinct phenotypes, with the ALS-linked mutant exhibiting axonal transport deficits and neuromuscular junction disruption, while cytoplasmic mislocalised TDP-43 heightened susceptibility to oxidative stress. Two FDA-approved drugs used to treat ALS, edaravone and riluzole, were examined in these models and revealed that edaravone, but not riluzole, was effective in rescuing motor deficits associated with cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression and, to a lesser extent, mutant TDP-43_G294V. Collectively, these findings reveal distinct pathological consequences of TDP-43 dysregulation, providing neuron-centric mechanistic insights, and establish the humanised TDP-43 zebrafish as an efficient system for preclinical therapeutic testing.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

F.; Baldwin, A. S.", "abstract": "The letter acuity impairment in the amblyopic eye often exceeds predictions made from the cut-off spatial frequency for grating detection. Spatial scrambling in the amblyopic eye's projections to the visual cortex has been proposed to bear some responsibility for this additional deficit. Using a novel stimulus algorithm that creates spatially scrambled bandpass letters, we generated stimuli simulating either: i) \"cortical scrambling\" at the output of oriented model \"simple cells\", or ii) \"subcortical scrambling\" of isotropic subunits that combine to form these simple cells. We also investigated a more conventional \"noise masking\" with bandpass noise. We performed two bandpass letter identification experiments, equating the stimuli shown to each eye by normalising either: i) their contrast, presenting them at four times their contrast detection threshold; or ii) their spatial scale, presenting them at twice the participant's acuity threshold for each eye. At the group level, we found that the amblyopic eye is less efficient at performing letter identification in bandpass noise. We did not find an overall significant difference with either scrambling type when comparing efficiency between the amblyopic and fellow eye, but we did find such a difference when partitioning our participants by their stereopsis ability. In further analyses of the pattern of mistakes, we found the amblyopic eye shows a distinctive behaviour which correlates with the acuity deficit for both types of scrambling. These results demonstrate that our scrambled stimuli interrogate a component of amblyopic vision that is functionally distinct from that addressed by contrast noise masking.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

While its physiological roles are well characterized, the evolutionary origins and molecular diversification of its ligands and receptors remain incompletely defined. Here, we present the most comprehensive phylogenetic and sequence conservation analysis of this system to date, using over 1,000 sequences from vertebrates, invertebrates, and viruses. Our analyses reveal that insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 form distinct monophyletic clades that diverged after the emergence of vertebrates, with IGF-1 being the most conserved ligand. We show that IGF1R binding residues, especially in the A and B domains of IGF1, are highly conserved across vertebrates, while insulin Site 2 residues, which overlap with its dimerization and hexamerization surface, are more variable correlating with the loss of hexamer formation in hystricomorphs, reptiles, and jawless fish. Unexpectedly, we identify a 12 amino acid insert in the insulin receptor (IR) of turtles and tortoises, previously thought to be unique to mammalian IR-B isoform, suggesting an earlier evolutionary origin of isoform diversity. We also show that marsupials and monotremes retain ancestral receptor domain features shared with reptiles and birds, and that avian insulins, particularly A-chain residues, are unusually conserved. Viral insulin/IGF-like peptides (VILPs) fall into two distinct clades that resemble either IGFs or insulin.

Pathogens acquire AMR much faster than we discover new drugs, warranting new methods to better understand the molecular underpinnings of AMR. Traditional approaches for detecting AMR in novel bacterial strains are time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, advances in sequencing technology offer a plethora of bacterial genome data, and computational approaches like machine learning (ML) provide an optimistic scope for in silico AMR prediction. Here, we introduce a comprehensive multiscale ML approach to predict AMR phenotypes and identify AMR molecular features associated with a single drug or drug family, stratified by time and geographical locations. As a case study, we focus on a subset of the World Health Organization's Bacterial Priority Pathogens, frequently drug-resistant and nosocomial bacteria: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two Enterobacter species. We started with sequenced genomes with lab-derived AMR phenotypes, constructed pangenomes, clustered protein sequences, and extracted protein domains to generate pangenomic features across molecular scales. To uncover the molecular mechanisms behind drug-/drug family-specific resistance, we trained logistic regression ML models on our datasets. These yielded ranked lists of AMR-associated genes, proteins, and domains. In addition to recapitulating known AMR features, our models identified novel candidates for experimental validation. They performed well across molecular scales, data types (binary vs. counts), and drugs. The models achieved a median normalized Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.89, suggesting robust performance across molecular scales with counts or presence/absence of features. Model performance showed resilience even when evaluated on geographical and temporal holdouts. Our holistic approach promises reliable prediction of existing and developing resistance in newly sequenced pathogen genomes, along with the mechanistic molecular contributors of AMR.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are assemblies of biomolecules, which function without a dividing lipid membrane in a cellular environment. These MLOs, termed biomolecular condensates, are commonly formed by the thermodynamic process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and assembly of large numbers of proteins, nucleic acids and co-solvent molecules. Within MLOs, certain biomolecule types are particularly causative of phase separation, and are termed \"scaffolds\" as they provide the major driving forces for self-assembly. Other molecules that are present in a condensate, but are less causative than the scaffold molecules are termed \"clients\". Much effort has recently decoded many of the molecular interactions underlying LLPS in search of predicting equilibrium concentrations and materials properties of condensates. In this work, we provide a simple computational approach to predict the partitioning of globular protein clients into condensates primarily composed of disordered protein scaffolds. Specifically, we use multiple methods to calculate hydration free energy of a series of globular proteins, and find that hydration free energy is relatively well-correlated with the partition coefficient of these proteins into condensates. We then provide a comparison of different hydration free energy predictors and discuss why some may provide a more accurate prediction of partitioning. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of hydration free energy as a predictor by identifying other possible confounding factors such as specific interactions, charge matching, and differential solvation inside a condensate, which will aid in making more robust predictions in future studies trained on more diverse data sets.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Proper histone expression is essential for cell proliferation and chromatin organization, yet the upstream regulators of histone supply remain incompletely understood.

Using time-resolved nascent transcriptional profiling, quantitative proteomics, and imaging, we show that PRMT5 activity is required to sustain histone transcription and histone protein synthesis during S phase. PRMT5 inhibition or knockdown leads to rapid histone mRNA depletion, loss of histone proteins, and accumulation of replication-associated nuclear abnormalities. We further show that soluble histone H4 accumulates at histone locus bodies (HLBs) upon PRMT5 inhibition, and that PRMT5-substrate H4 Arginine 3 mutants localize more robustly to HLBs than do wildtype H4. These findings support a model in which PRMT5-mediated methylation of histone H4 regulates histone transcription.

The set of domains encoded in the genome serves as the functional toolkit of the species. Here, we use a phylogenetic Birth-Death-Gain model to investigate the evolution of this protein toolkit in metazoa. Given a species tree and the set of protein domain families in each present-day species, this approach estimates the most likely rates of domain origination, duplication and loss. Statistical hierarchical clustering of domain family rates reveals sets of domains with similar rate profiles, consistent with groups of domains evolving in concert. Moreover, we find that domains with similar functions tend to have similar rate profiles. Interestingly, domains with functions associated with metazoan innovations, including immune response, cell adhesion, tissue repair, and signal transduction, tend to have the fastest rates. We further infer the expected ancestral domain content and the history of domain family gains, losses, expansions, and contractions on each branch of the species tree. In contrast to recent reports of widespread loss during metazoan evolution, we observe little evidence of genome streamlining. Rather, our analysis reveals an ongoing process of domain family replacement and resizing, consistent with extensive remodeling of the protein domain repertoire. The use of a powerful, probabilistic Birth-Death-Gain model reveals an unexpected level of genomic plasticity and a striking harmony between the evolution of domain usage in metazoan proteins and organismal innovation.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

L.; Sepil, I.", "abstract": "Phenotypic trade-offs, predicted to occur due to resource constraints, are not commonly observed. This discrepancy is explained by the seminal Y-model, where greater variation in resource acquisition (CV_A) than in allocation (CV_X) masks trade-offs. However, the Y-model is a heuristic rather than a quantitative tool with testable predictions. Additionally, which parameters modulate phenotypic trade-offs in the Y-model and their mechanism, remains unclear. Here, we simulate different parameters of the Y-model to understand their influence. We find that 'CV_A/(CV_A+CV_X)' accurately predicts the direction and strength of phenotypic correlations. However, contrary to common misinterpretations, the mean resource acquired by a population does not influence trade-offs; instead, the mean allocation strategy of a population does. Importantly, within-individual dependence of allocation on acquisition exacerbates the modulating influence of mean allocation. This causes greater sensitivity of phenotypic correlations to changes in CV_A or CV_X compared to independence of allocation and acquisition. We generate novel, testable hypotheses about trade-offs in the context of dietary restriction, plasticity, polymorphism, and pace-of-life. Furthermore, we validate our model against empirical data to demonstrate its utility. By systematically partitioning the influence of means, variances, and covariance, in the acquisition-allocation Y-model, we provide a simple, generalisable, quantitative synthesis for understanding phenotypic trade-offs.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

G.; H, S.; Vijay, N.", "abstract": "Background Genomic rearrangements, including segmental deletions, duplications, translocations, and inversions of DNA segments, can contribute to gene losses, thereby reshaping genome architecture and potentially resulting in functional consequences. In squamates, karyotypic evolution mainly involves chromosome number reduction through fusions and microchromosome to macrochromosome translocations, although fissions have also contributed to diversification in several lineages. Despite these dynamics, the evolutionary processes and underlying genetic mechanisms driving chromosomal rearrangements and associated gene losses in squamates remain poorly understood. Results In this study, we analysed chromosome/scaffold-level assemblies of 265 squamates, corroborated by short-read, long-read, and transcriptomic data. We found multiple lines of evidence for the absence of 53 genes in the squamate lineage. Notably, increased genomic rearrangement activity appears to be associated with the squamate-specific loss of these genes, including IL34, STAP1, LAPTM5, and TNIP2, which are key regulators of macrophage activation and polarisation. Most of the missing genes were intact in tuatara and other vertebrate species. Furthermore, we find that many of the genes missing from squamates are organised in syntenic clusters and are involved in essential immune functions, raising important questions about whether their absence in squamates reflects true gene loss or simply results from incomplete assemblies. Conclusions Together, our comparative genomic analyses highlight that the loss of crucial genes in squamate lineages has occurred primarily through inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements, including segmental deletions. These findings offer insights into the evolutionary loss of genes involved in macrophage differentiation and inform the development of novel pharmaceutical approaches for modulating immune responses.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

It is unclear, however, if p53 protects against particular forms of copy number alterations and whether it does so universally across cancer types. By analyzing p53 status and various aneuploidy features in 31 cancer types in the TCGA database, we verify that on a pan-cancer level p53-deficient cancers tend to have a higher degree of aneuploidy. However, for many cancer types, the average degree of aneuploidy is similar in p53-proficient and -deficient samples, and a substantial degree of aneuploidy can accumulate with intact p53 in almost all cancer types. Neither arm-level nor whole chromosome aneuploidy but rather chromosome loss events distinguish p53-deficient from proficient cancers. p53 inactivation is therefore neither sufficient nor necessary for the emergence of cancer aneuploidy, but is associated with the degree of aneuploidy in a subset of cancer types and more universally with chromosome losses.

Previous copper excess reduced fitness variation within each genotype and elicited heritable and reproducible fitness effects that depended on both the genotype and environment: genotypes that benefited from previous stress under recurring conditions suffered when the stress was absent, and vice versa. These transgenerational fitness effects were predicted best by copper resistance, explaining 30% of the intraspecific variation: the more susceptible a genotype, the more its offspring suffered from ancestral stress in the absence of recurrent stress; however, these offspring became more resistant to copper excess, likely by protecting the photosystem II.

In this study, we developed mathematical models and computer applications to investigate one- and two-allele models of habitat-preference barriers in sympatric populations under disruptive ecological selection. We examined two spatial arrangements: an open-space model inspired by sympatric cichlid fishes that meet in open water with niche habitats that are small relative to lake size, and a no-open-space model inspired by sympatric hawthorn and apple maggot flies that move directly between trees without lingering in midair. Next, we examined coupling between habitat-preference barriers and a two-allele mating-bias barrier developed in a prior study to analyze how their invasion and coupling dynamics could lead to stronger RI. Our findings confirm that habitat preference is an independent mechanism capable of establishing initial premating barriers in sympatric speciation. Moreover, it can couple with additional barriers, such as those based on mating-trait discrimination, to enhance overall RI. Because habitat preference is an adaptive barrier mechanism, its invasion and coupling are driven by selection pressures arising from maladaptive hybrid loss, and it is readily reversed when disruptive ecological selection weakens. The one-allele model is easier to evolve than the two-allele model because it is immune to recombination by gene flow. Habitat-preference barriers can facilitate the emergence of mating-bias barriers. Open-space systems provide fewer opportunities for inter-niche encounters and tend to result in stronger RI compared to no-open-space systems. By elucidating the habitat-preference mechanism, our study reinforces the important role of habitat-preference barriers in sympatric speciation.

Aggressive, treatment-resistant subtypes including androgen receptor (AR) -negative and neuroendocrine prostate cancer, present a significant clinical challenge. Platinum-based chemotherapies, such as carboplatin, remain a treatment option for these subtypes, but their efficacy is limited due to activation of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. Here, we report that DPYSL3 (CRMP4) is highly expressed in AR-negative prostate cancer, especially in liver metastases. We show that prostate cancer cells express two transcript variants of DPYSL3, DPYSL3A and DPYSL3B. While DPYSL3A has tumor-suppressive roles, the function of DPYSL3B remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that high DPYSL3B expression correlates with poor patient survival in prostate cancer. Functional studies revealed that DPYSL3B silencing impairs proliferation and sensitizes prostate cancer cells to carboplatin-induced DNA damage. Gene set enrichment analyses of DPYSL3B-depleted cells showed negative enrichment of pathways related to the cell cycle and DNA repair, including E2F1, AURKA, homologous recombination, and the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, consistent with impaired DNA repair capacity. This was accompanied by {gamma}H2AX foci accumulation and apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase-3/7 activity, particularly under carboplatin exposure.

Approximately 10%-15% of patients with PCCs and 35%-40% with PGLs go on to develop metastatic disease, leading to a reported median overall survival of 7 years. The development of prognostic markers and subsequent personal therapeutic strategies are hindered by a lack of understanding of tumourigenesis. In other organs, cells with stem-like properties are at the root of tumour initiation and maintenance, due to their ability to self-renew and give rise to differentiated cells. We have recently shown that, in the human adrenal, a subset of sustentacular cells, endowed with a support role, are in fact SOX2+ postnatal adrenomedullary stem cells, that are specified along the neural crest migratory route. In this study, we intended to determine if SOX2+ cells in PCCs and PGLs can behave as tumour-initiating stem cells. Using expression and transcriptomic studies, we demonstrate the presence of SOX2/SOX2-expressing cells across a broad range of PCCs and PGLs, irrespective of tumour aggressiveness, location, and causative mutation. In silico analyses reveal the co-expression of SOX2 and chromaffin cell markers in the tumour, and the active proliferation of these double-positive cells. Isolation of these cells in vitro in stem cell-promoting media, and their xenotransplantation on chicken chorioallantoic membranes, demonstrates that they have the potential to expand and metastasise in ovo, supporting their potential as tumour-initiating cells.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Among those pathways, elevated asparagine metabolism regulated by asparagine synthetase (ASNS) has been linked to tumor progression in various cancers, driving cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and metastasis. ASNS inhibition represents a promising therapeutic strategy, but inhibitors have shown limited efficacy due to poor specificity and cell permeability. Through phenotypic screening, we identified ASX-173, a cell-permeable small molecule that inhibits ASNS at nanomolar concentrations. Biochemical and cellular assays confirm the specificity of ASX-173 activity and demonstrate its potentiation of the anti-cancer activity of L-asparaginase (ASNase), a key component of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. Mechanistically, the combination treatment disrupted nucleotide synthesis and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia, the combination significantly delayed the growth of OCI-AML2 xenografts. Analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that ASNS mRNA expression is associated with poor survival in some cancer types and that ASNS protein levels are elevated in multiple solid tumors compared with the levels in normal tissues, suggesting possible broad utility of ASNS inhibition across the landscape of cancer. Together, these findings establish ASX-173 as a promising ASNS inhibitor and, for the first time, demonstrate a viable strategy to target ASNS therapeutically-an approach that has long remained elusive.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

In MC38 colon tumors, repeated anti-CD40 or radiotherapy created necrosis that split TAMs into peripheral Cxcl9+ and peri-necrotic Spp1+ subsets. Spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA-seq, and Keap1-deficient mice showed that the latter are NRF2high \"stress-TAMs\", with immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting activity. The same NRF2 activation gradient separates pro-inflammatory CXCL9+ and anti-inflammatory SPP1+ TAMs across diverse human cancers. NRF2high TAMs silence IFN-STAT1 programmes, lose MHC-II and chemokine expression, fail to expand T cells, drive tumor cell invasion in 3D co-cultures, and foster metastasis. Constitutive hematopoietic NRF2 activation accelerated the growth of therapy-naive MMTV-PyMT breast tumors and markedly impaired anti-CD40 efficacy in MC38 subcutaneous and lung-metastasis models. Conversely, macrophage-specific Nrf2 deletion restored immunogenic TAMs and potentiated anti-CD40 and anti-PD-1 treatments. Thus, NRF2 constitutes a stress-response axis that fixes TAMs in a pro-cancer, therapy-resistant state; inhibiting it could revive the macrophage-T-cell amplification loop and broaden immunotherapy responses.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Currently, most NOD2 agonists are derivatives or analogs of the endogenous agonist derived from bacterial peptidoglycan, muramyl dipeptide (MDP). These MDP-based agonists can suffer from low oral bioavailability and cause significant adverse side effects. With the goal of broadly improving NOD2 therapeutic interventions, we sought to discover a novel small molecule capable of activating NOD2 by screening a library of 1917 FDA approved compounds in a phenotypic assay. We identified a class of compounds, benzimidazoles, that act as NOD2 agonists, with the most potent member of this class being nocodazole.

Tke5 belongs to the BTH_I2691 protein family and harbours an N-terminal marker for the type six secretion system effectors (MIX) motif, previously shown to be required for T6SS-dependent secretion in other systems. Many MIX-containing effectors require T6SS adaptor proteins (Tap) for secretion, but until now, the molecular mechanism for adaptor-effector binding has remained elusive.

We determined a cryo-EM structure of human SLC1A1 bound to compound 3e, a recently described SLC1A1-selective bicyclic imidazo[1,2-]pyridine-3-amine (BIA) inhibitor. 3e binds a membrane-embedded, allosteric pocket accessible only in the apo state, when SLC1A1 is unbound to substrate and sodium. Wedged between the trimerization domain and the substrate-binding transport domain, together with a cholesterol moiety from the lipid bilayer, 3e likely prevents sodium and substrate binding, and blocks SLC1A1's elevator-like movements that are essential for transport. Mutations in this pocket abolish 3e binding and counteract 3e's cytotoxicity in RCC cells, confirming on-target activity and explaining SLC1A1 selectivity.

Tissue kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) participate in pathophysiological processes in ECs. We aimed to explore the roles of endothelial KLKs in DN and define the underlying mechanisms. Methods and results: KLK8 was the most highly upregulated member of KLKs in renal tissues in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and cultured glomerular ECs (GECs) upon high glucose (HG) treatment. Both global (Klk8-/-) and endothelial Klk8 knockout (Klk8EC) mice displayed improved albuminuria, mesangial matrix expansion and glomerulosclerosis caused by STZ compared to Klk8f/f mice. Single-cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) showed that many pathways associated with DN in ECs, mesangial cells (MCs) and tubule cells were reversed in Klk8EC mice. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) was extensively improved in Klk8EC mice, and by KLK8 siRNA in cultured GECs upon HG. Using proteome and other biochemical approaches, we revealed that KLK8 cleaved syndecan-4(SDC4), which contributed to loss of glycocalyx integrity in GECs in cultured cells and animal diabetic models. Furthermore, scRNA-seq showed that Lifr was one of the key genes linked to the disease progressed in ECs and MCs and regulated by endothelial Klk8. LIFR signaling contributed to HG-induced GEC dysfunction and MC activation, which was associated with endothelial Klk8. Knockdown of Lifr by lentivirus-Lifr shRNA ameliorated hallmark features of DN and improved EndMT and Sdc4 expression glomeruli of diabetic mice. LIFR was upregulated in GECs and MCs in DN patients. Circulatory levels of LIF, KLK8 and soluble SDC4 were increased in patients with DN, and KLK8 level was positively correlated with LIF, soluble SDC4 and creatinine levels. Conclusion: Endothelial KLK8 promotes GECs dysfunction and abnormal crosstalk with MCs through a LIFR-dependent signaling in DN, which immediately highlights therapeutic targets for DN.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Accumulating evidence supports that EgAgB may exert immunomodulatory effects on myeloid cells; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We examined the impact of native EgAgB (nEgAgB) and recombinant EgAgB8/1 (rEgAgB) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC), to help elucidate these mechanisms. Both immunoaffinity-purified nEgAgB or rEgAgB induced modest BMDC activation, indicated by the production of IL-6, IL-12p40, and nitric oxide, but not IFN-{beta}. This activation was primarily attributed to LPS traces in EgAgB preparations since it was nearly abolished by a specific TLR4 inhibitor and in Tlr4-/- BMDC, while EgAgB binding to BMDC was TLR4-independent. Notably, both nEgAgB and rEgAgB inhibited LPS-induced cytokine and nitric oxide production, and disrupted TLR4 dimerization and endocytosis. Competitive binding assays showed that EgAgB and human high-density lipoprotein (hHDL) similarly inhibited LPS binding to macrophages and BMDC; however, EgAgB more effectively suppressed LPS-induced cytokine secretion. Contrastingly, EgAgB did not modulate BMDC responses to lipoteichoic acid, unlike hHDL. Using dynamic light scattering and an ELISA-like assay, we demonstrated a higher potential of EgAgB to bind LPS than hHDL. Additionally, docking analyses suggest the presence of a defined LPS-binding interface in EgAgB8/1 subunit. Overall, these findings reveal a novel binding property of EgAgB, which enables it to act as an extracellular LPS scavenger, interfering with TLR4-mediated LPS recognition and downstream proinflammatory responses in myeloid cells.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Meripilus giganteus is traditionally consumed by the people of the North-eastern regions of the Himalayas, India. In this study, we planned for the stepwise bioactivity-guided isolation of natural molecules from M. giganteus and to synthesize more potential therapeutic derivatives against the drug-resistant Leishmania infection. HPLC chromatogram of ethyl acetate extract obtained from M. giganteus revealed the presence of ethyl linoleate as the most active anti-leishmanial molecule. Several derivatives of ethyl linoleate were synthesized and evaluated against Leishmania promastigotes. Among them, a single epoxygenated variant of ethyl linoleate, ethyl (Z)-8-(3-(oct-2-en-1-yl) oxiran-2-yl) octanoate (EL3), showed promising anti-leishmanial activity against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Leishmania donovani. The lead derivative disrupts the biosynthesis of trypanothione from glutathione and spermidine, making the parasite vulnerable to the oxidative burst inside the host.

We identified full-length Rec protein sequences in the human genome and selected 23 variants for functional characterization. Using a dual-color fluorescent reporter and a complementary ELISA assay, we found that Rec proteins from only 7 genomic loci were functional.

We show that alternative splicing is widespread and highly context-dependent. Comparisons between strains on different diets revealed abundant gene-by-environment interactions affecting alternative splicing, with most genes showing strain- and sex-specific diet responses. More often than not, genes that were differentially spliced between strains were not differentially expressed, adding to evidence that the two regulatory mechanisms often act independently. Moreover, differentially spliced genes were more widely expressed across tissues but also less central to biological networks than differentially expressed genes, suggesting differences in pleiotropic constraint. Importantly, divergence in alternative splicing was found to be predominantly driven by cis-regulatory changes. However, trans changes affecting splicing make be central to plasticity as they were impacted more by environmental variation. Finally, we performed scans for selection and found that, while genes with splicing divergence more often co-localized with genomic outliers associated with metabolic traits, they were not enriched for genomic outliers.

For our hypothesis test, we use a computationally efficient approach from the stochastic processes literature to derive genome-wide significance levels that control the family-wise error rate (FWER). Whole genome simulations indicate that our method conservatively controls the FWER. Because positive selection can lead to false discoveries, we pair our IBD mapping approach with a selection scan so that one can contrast results for evidence of confounding due to recent sweeps or other mechanisms, like population structure, that increase IBD sharing. We developed automated and reproducible workflows to phase haplotypes, call local ancestry probabilities, and perform the IBD mapping scan, the former two tasks being important preprocessing steps for haplotype analyses. We applied our methods to search for Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk loci in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) genome data.

Current computational deconvolution methods attempt to address this limitation but uniformly suffer from reference dependency, platform effects, and complete neglect of tissue morphology. Here we present SpatialCell AI, a computational framework that achieves true single-cell resolution from spot-based spatial transcriptomics through morphology-guided computational enhancement. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on expression similarity, SpatialCell AI integrates AI-powered cell segmentation from histological images with spatial gene expression, eliminating reference requirements while leveraging tissue architecture. We rigorously validated our approach using publicly available matched colorectal cancer samples analyzed across Visium (55m), Visium HD (8m, 16m), and Xenium (single-cell ground truth). SpatialCell AI achieved strong accuracy with expression correlation of r=0.791, 7.82-fold improvement in expression accuracy, and 5.30-fold enhancement in gene detection compared to spot-based measurements. Comprehensive benchmarking against 28+ existing methods revealed that all computational approaches share identical limitations that SpatialCell AI uniquely overcomes through its morphology-first design. The framework converts standard Visium outputs from spot-level to true single-cell resolution (Cell_1, Cell_2, Cell_3...), enabling precise cellular interaction mapping and rare cell type identification previously impossible with spot-based technologies. By bridging the resolution gap between affordable spot-based platforms and expensive single-cell technologies, this approach enables broader access to single-cell resolution analysis for research and clinical applications.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

However, the inherent complexity of lipid networks complicates traditional modeling approaches. We present a modular, extendable framework for constructing mechanistic models of lipid kinetics via a case study, modeling the synthesis and degradation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a second messenger central to receptor signaling and calcium regulation. Our method efficiently identifies rate constants governing enzymatic dynamics and can be extended to a range of signaling networks. Using experimental time-course data for PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P2, and IP, we optimized five kinetic parameters to capture the lipid and second messenger dynamics. The resulting model achieved a strong correlation with experimental trends and reproduced dynamic behaviors relevant to cellular signaling. We then applied the model to simulate signaling perturbations linked to PI4KA and PIP5K1C loss-of-function, two lipid kinases associated with neurodevelopmental and neuromuscular disorders.

Currently, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) has become the preferred surgical method to achieve sustained weight loss and reverse obesity-related disease. Human studies have documented an improvement in dyslipidemias. 40% of VSG patients can discontinue statin treatment by 6 months, while alterations in plasma bile acids and synthesis have been observed after bariatric surgery. Although it is well known that cholesterol is the precursor for all bile acids, the link between changes in the plasma cholesterol and bile acids remains unclear in the context of VSG. Here, we present a murine model of VSG that leads to a marked decrease in plasma cholesterol levels despite no difference in body weight compared to sham surgery. Our results demonstrate that gastric resection lowers systemic cholesterol burden by promoting the hepatobiliary elimination of cholesterol through the upregulation of bile acid synthesis. These observations imply that gastric resection impacts overall hepatic physiology and cholesterol homeostasis. Understanding these weight-independent changes provides an opportunity to discover novel regulatory pathways that may be harnessed for therapeutic purposes.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

As a result, the molecular mechanisms underlying gap junction plaque assembly in cells remain poorly understood.

Using cryogenic electron tomography and focused ion beam milling, we resolve the structure of human connexin-43 gap junction plaques at 14 A resolution.

Complementary coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations illuminate how lipids pack between adjacent connexin molecules contributing to the plaque organization and stability.

We demonstrate that CARM1 methylates arginine residues within the proline-rich motif of ALIX. At the molecular level, ALIX methylation impairs SH3-dependent association with CD2AP, CIN85, and endophilin-A2 that are required for cytokinesis.

TMEM263 was discovered in a screen as an ER-resident protein, and we have characterised its role as both necessary and sufficient for lipid droplet formation. TMEM263 has two transmembrane domains that fold into a hairpin structure which are essential for its localisation to the ER and to lipid droplets.

We previously demonstrated that activation of the cardiac growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) pathway using high potency synthetic agonists of GHRH (GHRH-agonists: MR-356 and MR-409) improves the HFpEF phenotype in both large and small animal models, including in a murine model of cardiometabolic HFpEF (High fat diet + the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME [HFD+L-NAME]). Here we sought to define the downstream signaling pathways responsible for this effect. A transcriptomic screen in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) identified the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 pathway as being activated by GHRH receptor (GHRHR) signaling, revealing an oxygen-independent mechanism of HIF-1 activation. Based on this finding, we investigated the interaction between the cardioprotective effects of the GHRH-agonist MR-356 and HIF-1 pathway activation in the murine HFD+L-NAME model of cardiometabolic HFpEF. We generated a cardiomyocyte-specific HIF-1  knockout (HIF-1CMKO) mouse line and demonstrated that our previously reported beneficial effects of GHRH-agonist administration were completely abolished in HIF-1CMKO mice.

T.", "abstract": "As humans and other animals age, passive and active muscle properties change markedly, with reduced peak tension, peak strain rate, activation and deactivation rate, and increased parallel stiffness. It is thought that these alterations modify locomotor performance, but establishing causal links is difficult when many parameters vary at once. We developed a simplified model of a single joint with two antagonistic Hill-type muscles, and varied the associated muscle parameters combinatorially over a large range. For a given parameter combination, we found optimal joint movements that minimized cumulative squared error to a target while starting and ending at rest. Emergent behaviour from the optimisations compared well to ballistic point-to-point arm movements in humans. Age-associated reductions of maximum isometric force, maximum strain rate and activation rate all had detrimental effects on performance, independent of other parameters. In contrast, deactivation time and passive parallel stiffness had no effect on performance on their own, but pronounced interactive effects with each other. Increasing stiffness reduced joint movement time at fast deactivation rates, but increased movement time at slow deactivation rates. This occurs because antagonist muscles resist the passive tension at rest, but are stretched eccentrically by the agonist, amplifying their active resistive force. Fast-deactivating muscles can avoid this resistive effect, allowing the passive stiffness to amplify accelerating force and enhance performance. In all cases, coactivation emerged during and after the braking period, and during the acceleration phase when stiffness increased. As deactivation time increased, so too did coactivation levels-- but coactivation was not generally associated with a reduction in performance. Our simulations offer evidence that age-related changes in muscle strength, activation time and maximum contraction velocity could lead to reductions in ballistic performance in a goal-directed task, but the effects of increased muscle stiffness and deactivation time depend on their relative values.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed a network inference framework to uncover how menopause triggers coordinated shifts in intercellular signaling cascades that promote fibrosis. We leveraged publicly archived single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the liver, lung, pancreas, and skeletal muscle of ovariectomized and control mice. Given the central role of immune cells in orchestrating inflammation and fibrosis, we focused our analysis on immune cell populations. Using canonical markers of immune cells, we annotated major cell types and reconstructed cell-cell interaction networks to map transcriptional responses to hormonal shifts. Network analysis revealed pervasive reshaping of intercellular signaling common to all tissues evaluated in the setting of menopause. Within this immune-centered framework, we found that estrogen-responsive macrophages consistently function as major signaling hubs across all tissues evaluated, exhibiting extensive interactions with myofibroblasts, key drivers of extracellular matrix production and fibrotic remodeling. Notably, these shared signaling patterns were not detectable using conventional differential gene expression analysis, which revealed minimal overlap in gene-level responses in macrophages across tissues. In addition to conserved patterns, we identified tissue-specific interaction networks that reflect unique immune adaptations to hormonal loss. As an example, natural killer cells acted as a signaling hub in muscle-specific patterns, suggesting their direct contribution to menopausal skeletal muscle adaptation. Tissue-specific patterning was also evident in the liver, lung, and pancreas, where other immune cell types, such as CD8+ T cells and endothelial cells, functioned as prominent signaling hubs, indicating diverse remodeling of the immune microenvironment. The network approach introduced here represents a systems-level framework for mapping multicellular network rewiring following hormonal depletion and highlights conserved immune-stromal modules as potential therapeutic targets to prevent menopause-associated dysfunction.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Tree traits do not vary independently but rather in coordination. However, our understanding of whether functional traits are governed by the same mechanism is far from complete. Thus, we aim at assessing the drivers of trait variability of sessile oak and European beech provenances across their distribution ranges. We estimated growth-related and leaf morphological traits from 9 and 11 provenances of oak and beech, respectively, grown in four different common gardens distributed across their respective distribution areas. Overall, phenotypic plasticity played a dominant role in explaining individual trait variability. For most oak traits, variation among provenances and genetically based plasticity were correlated with the climate of origin, whereas fewer significant associations were found for beech. In oak, climate-transfer distance analyses revealed that traits such as DBH, height, specific leaf area, and long-term growth responses to summer temperature decreased when provenances were moved away from their local precipitation regime. In beech, significant climate-transfer distances were fewer and primarily related to temperature-related parameters. These results suggest that natural selection and local adaptation may play a secondary but notable role. The pattern of multi-trait phenotypes indicates that resource-use strategies among provenances covary with the temperatures of origin in both species. The limited genetic responses in beech could hinder its survival if it reaches the boundaries of trait plasticity, while oak may better adjust through adaptation.

Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) exhibit dropping behavior in response to predators like the seven spot ladybird (Coccinella septempunctata). This response could be an effective anti predator defense but could be costly in terms of energy expenditure and time not available for feeding. To investigate the impact of behavioral variation on food-chain persistence and dynamics, we used a tri trophic experimental system with Vicia faba (plant), pea aphids (prey), and seven spot ladybirds (predator), implementing three aphid behavioral treatments: droppers, non droppers, and a mix of both droppers and non droppers. To minimize genetic differences, we used clonal aphid populations across all treatments. We then tracked predator prey population dynamics and species persistence over 25 days. Our results showed that aphid dropping behavior reduced food chain persistence, with extinction risk significantly higher in dropper treatments than in the mix or non dropper treatments. Ladybirds persisted across treatments, although they showed a steeper decline in abundance in the dropper treatment. In the mixed behavioral treatment, they had an intermediate persistence, suggesting a buffering effect of behavioral variation. Trophic food chain state transitions also differed by treatment, with tri trophic states most stable in the non dropper, and least frequent in the dropper treatment. Furthermore, our results showed a trend of dropper treatments becoming more stable and robust towards the end of the experiment.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive genomic approach for assessing the genetic profiles of candidate founders for ex-situ breeding, with the goal of releasing surplus individuals while using the endangered Saker Falcons (Falco cherrug) as a study model. Genetic clustering of 31 captive sakers revealed both diverse origins, some matching wild Asian individuals (Mongolia), and a lineage (Group III) divergent from wild populations. Comparative analyses detected hybridisation signals in 61.3% of individuals, including three with gyrfalcon (F. rusticolus) introgression and Group III's pronounced divergence indicating past interbreeding with an unknown falcon species. All captive birds exhibited severe inbreeding (FROH = 0.352), far exceeding wild population levels (FROH = 0.131). Using the partial pedigree data of the captive sakers, we established a genetic relatedness threshold of 0.154 (95% CI: 0.096-0.211) to identify cases of related dyads (both full and half-siblings). At this threshold, 18.3% of captive dyads showed relatedness, with asymmetric genetic contributions between pairs, reflecting a functionally small breeding flock. To avoid risks from releasing admixed or inbred individuals, we recommend excluding introgressed birds, strategically pairing purebreds, and sourcing new founders from genetically validated wild sources, especially underrepresented Central Asian lineages.

Honeybees have sophisticated cognitive and learning capacities, including categorization of stimuli on the basis of perceptual (e.g., symmetry) and abstract (e.g., sameness/difference) concepts. Here we investigated whether bees could extrapolate the temporal regularity of a sequence. By exploiting the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), we investigated whether honeybees could learn and generalize a particular sequence structure composed of different odors presented in a specific temporal order. Different conditioning paradigms (i.e., absolute, differential, generalization) were employed. Bees used different strategies, such as an early tendency to encode the single odor properties, instead of learning the entire sequence pattern. The use of a generalization paradigm potentially uncovered a spontaneous tendency to transfer over similar structures one hour after the training irrespective of the single-element properties, though this finding is not yet conclusive. These results shed light on the strategies used by bees to solve an odor abstraction task, highlighting the crucial role of the type of conditioning to let them emerge.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Therefore, here we have developed a new computational pipeline that accounts for this observation. Additionally, the new method accurately recovers large ranges and spatial heterogeneity of hydrogel moduli induced by cellular remodeling associated with enhanced extracellular matrix secretion and MMP-degradation. The algorithm sought best fit of the 3D displacement field with a multi-stage approach, wherein the Tikhonov regularization parameter in L-BFGS was progressively lowered. Forward simulations were performed in FEniCS, with gradients computed with FEniCS-adjoint and MOOLA to weight degrees of freedom according to hydrogel volume affected. Once developed, we conducted a series of synthetic test cases applying actual cell geometries, experimentally-matched compressibility, and realistic displacements with experimental noise levels. Employing an incompressible material model resulted in predicted moduli with over 415% mean relative error and predicted strain energies 5-fold greater than the prescribed values. Moreover, errors in predicted traction forces were amplified by a factor of 10. Thus, accounting for hydrogel compressibility was critical for accurate hydrogel moduli and strain energy recovery. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we applied it to TFM data of human mitral valve interstitial cells embedded in PEG hydrogels with pre-altered moduli of 54 Pa. We determined that J ranged [0.45, 1.66] and local hydrogel moduli exhibited large variations, 3.6 Pa to 2.4 MPa.

How have TFs diversified and gained their functions? We use the CRP/FNR family to study this question across ~6000 prokaryotic genomes. Characterized by homology to TFs CRP (cyclic AMP Receptor Protein) and FNR (Regulator of Fumarate and Nitrate Reductase) in Escherichia coli, the two functions of this family - sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation by direct contacts to RNA polymerase - are conferred by the helix-turn-helix containing DNA binding domain. We constructed a rooted phylogeny of this domain and performed residue conservation analysis on extant and in-silico reconstructed ancestral sequences of CRP/FNR family members. Residues that confer DNA binding specificity likely emerged in the overall ancestor of the sequence family. This ancestor does not fall into classes containing either E. coli CRP (Eco-CRP) or E. coli FNR (Eco-FNR) clades, but instead a large and diverse class that we call CRP-like. Residues key for base-specific DNA binding remain largely conserved in the family. Residues (together called AR1) which make direct contacts with CTD of RNA Polymerase are conserved only in the Eco-CRP class and restricted to Gammaproteobacteria. The corresponding 287 determinant interface on CTD is again fully conserved only in Gammaproteobacteria, which contain Eco-CRP members, following step-wise evolution initiated at the Proteobacterial common ancestor. These suggest suggesting co-emergence of the interface residues in Eco-CRP. Our analysis hence shows that Class I transcriptional activation through AR1 on CRP and the determinant of CTD, as described in E. coli CRP, is phylogenetically restricted, while base-specific DNA binding has been present in the CRP/FNR family throughout its evolutionary history.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

To address these challenges, we study the applicability of the knockoff (KO) procedure. Introduced by Barber and Cand&egraves in 2015, the KO variable selection procedure has shown promising results on real biological data, such as Genome Wide Association Studies. This method seeks to identify the truly important predictors by overcoming the correlation structure between variables while controlling the false discovery rate. Here, we study the applicability of the KO procedure on transcriptomic data in a classification setting. We conduct an extensive simulation study using real transcriptomic data to evaluate the performance of the KO framework in the context of high-dimensional classification. We find that the KO framework outperforms widely used variable selection models, and that using KO aggregation to mitigate the effect of KO stochasticity improves stability while maintaining the same power. Finally applied to three real transcriptomic datasets, the KO framework made very few discoveries, highlighting its conservative nature and suggesting that other methods may substantially overestimate the number of relevant features.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

One approach to target these channels, is to manipulate the membrane charge which involves the use of wireless bipolar electrodes such as carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs), which could be inserted into cell membranes to mimic these channels, to provide a novel bioelectronic method for modulating cancer cell behavior by mimicking io. By utilizing membrane dyes, we observed alterations in Vmem induced by CNTPs and externally applied electric fields. Analyses of cellular behaviors and processes indicated that Vmem is more receptive to stimuli in invasive cancers, while it leads to increased metabolism in less invasive cancers, with notable changes in the cell cycle occurring at approximately 48 hours post-treatment in GBM cell lines. This work shows that CNTPs and electric fields can be used to modulate Vmem and alter cancer cell processes, supporting their potential therapeutic capability.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

We find that including the {zeta}-chain in first ({zeta}-CAR), second (28{zeta}-CAR and BB{zeta}-CAR), and third (28BB{zeta}-CAR) generation CARs largely determines pY signalling, irrespective of costimulation. Further, we show that the phosphatase activity of PTPN22 and SHP-1 are largely negligible for activation of CARs, but indiscriminate inhibition of phosphatases using Pervanadate (PV) selectively activates BB{zeta}-CARs without antigen encounter. Finally, we find that selective, partial inhibition of Itk using Soquelitinib reduces basal CD69 expression in Jurkat CAR T cells while maintaining their ability to activate in response to antigen.

To address this, we present an explainable deep learning model that predicts BRAF V600E mutation status directly from diagnostic whole-slide images (WSIs) of skin cutaneous melanoma. Using histopathological WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and their corresponding mutation labels (BRAF wildtype vs. BRAF V600E), we trained a weakly supervised deep learning pipeline, XpressO, to identify tumor regions of interest (ROIs) predictive of BRAF mutation status. The model outputs attention heatmaps highlighting spatially relevant diagnostic features and computes a combined probability score from the top ten attention regions per WSI. These regions are further reviewed by a pathologist for biological appropriateness. On an independent test set, the model achieved an AUC of 0.79 with balanced precision and recall, correctly identifying 7 of 8 BRAF V600E mutant cases. This demonstrates the model's ability to capture phenotypic correlates of mutation status and highlights the potential of computational pathology in precision oncology.

Although all dicarbonyls disrupt biomolecular structure and function by forming advanced glycation end products, understanding the relative toxicity of each can help design targeted control strategies. Although known for cells, the comparative effects of distinct dicarbonyls on extracellular matrices (ECM) have yet to be benchmarked. Here, we investigate how glycation by three well known dicarbonyls: the C2--dicarbonyls methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO), and the C6--dicarbonyl 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), affects two ECMs, Collagen I and laminin-rich basement membrane (lrBM), and alters their morphodynamic interactions with two human cells: untransformed endothelial TeloHAEC and aggressive triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231. On dicarbonyl-treated lrBM, endothelial and cancer cell adhesion, collective cord morphogenesis, cancer cell motility, shape polarity and its entropy are perturbed at low MGO levels, high GO levels, and are unchanged for 3-DG. Alcian Blue staining of lrBM shows dissolution of matrix at low MGO and high GO levels with no effect on 3-DG exposure. On collagen I substrata, adhesion for both cells is disrupted at low MGO levels, at high GO levels but is unchanged for 3-DG. Interestingly at high concentrations of MGO and GO, the latter decreases motility and increases elongation entropy more than the former; 3-DG has no effect. Picrosirius staining suggests that at high levels GO-driven collagen hyperpolymerization is similar to MGO with no effect of 3-DG. Our observations therefore suggest qualitative and quantitative distinctions in the effect of C2- and C-6--dicarbonyls on ECM homoeostasis and ECM-driven cellular morphodynamics.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

This study introduces Raman spectroscopy as a novel, chemically selective monitoring approach for the analysis of subtle biochemical changes in BMVs across different bacterial growth phases. BMVs derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative human pathogen responsible for severe nosocomial infections, were isolated at six different time points and analyzed via established physicochemical and functional assays, as well as Raman spectroscopy. While established analytics revealed growth phase-dependent variations in protein content, surface charge, and immunogenic effects on human immune cells, Raman spectroscopy enabled the comprehensive analysis of molecular-level changes between isolation time points. Significant shifts in protein-to-lipid ratios, higher lipid saturation, and changes in protein secondary structure were detected in BMVs isolated from later growth phases. Further, the absence of spectral markers for nucleic acids enabled the identification of BMVs as outer membrane vesicles. These findings emphasize the critical influence of the isolation time point on BMV properties and highlight Raman spectroscopy as a powerful tool for semi-quantitative chemical profiling, revealing minuscule yet biologically significant changes in BMVs depending on isolation time points.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Research into ecosystem microbial community structure and functional genetic diversity is essential for insight into global change and provides much-needed data for predictive models. Engineered transitional systems, such as aqueducts and networks of irrigation canals, have not been investigated for carbon flux and microbial community structure. Engineered interfaces may be acting as 'hotspots' with impacts disproportionate to their geographic area. The Delta-Mendota aqueduct in California is 117 miles long and spans five counties; it is connected to 723 miles of irrigation canals within Merced County. This project combines field greenhouse gas measurements and culture-independent metagenomic analysis to identify the microbial communities of these two systems. This work maps the biogeographical distribution of organisms within these systems and defines their functional potential. DNA was extracted from 97 samples of sediment along 500 miles of irrigation canals in Merced County and sequenced with high-throughput whole genome sequencing. Each site was measured for methane and carbon dioxide flux with a field gas analyzer. Gas flux data was processed and visualized using multiple R packages. Metagenomic data was processed using multiple bioinformatics tools to bin and annotate genomes, normalize and quantify functional genes, and map the biogeographic distribution and phylogeny of identified microorganisms. Eighty-nine of the sample sites within the irrigation canal system demonstrated elevated carbon dioxide levels when compared to ambient air measurements (97%) and 43 sites had methane flux (44%). Results indicate a wide diversity of microorganisms present at each sampling site. Metagenomic analysis identified the microorganismal community of the sampled waterway sediments and confirmed the presence of metabolic pathways for methanogenesis and methane oxidation. Methanogenic genes were most abundant in methane producing sites. This community structure analysis reveals the potential of microbial biogeochemical activity and the gas measurements signal that greenhouse gas emission is currently occurring in these waterways.

This underscores the importance of studying how organisms respond to multiple environmental changes simultaneously. In aquatic ecosystems, as surface waters of lakes and oceans warm, longer and stronger periods of thermal stratification lead to changes in resource (light and nutrient) availability. We investigate the combined effect of temperature and resource availability on 19 populations (comprising 17 species) of freshwater phytoplankton to examine how temperature influences the minimum resource requirements (and Monod parameters) for light, nitrogen, and phosphorus. We also evaluate how resource availability affects each population's thermal traits (i.e. thermal performance curve -TPC-parameters). When averaged across all populations, the requirements for light and phosphorus tended to display a U-shaped relationship along temperatures. Individual populations varied greatly in their responses to temperature, leading to shifts in the identity of the best competitor across the thermal gradient, particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus. TPC responses to resource limitation were highly variable, but thermal optima and maxima of individual populations often decreased with resource limitation, and thermal breadths (range where growth is 80% or more of its maximum) often increased due to a flattening of TPCs. Across all populations and resource types, the maximum optimum temperature across resource levels (maximum Topt) tended to be positively correlated with the temperature at which they had the lowest resource requirements (minimum R*). However, the temperature at which populations had their lowest resource requirements tended to be ~5{degrees} C colder on average than the temperature at which they grew the fastest. The populations with the highest thermal optima also had the lowest minimum resource requirements.

Plants and herbivorous insects are engaged in long-term coevolutionary arms races, where gains in novel plant defences and corresponding adaptations in herbivores may drive evolutionary change. One such recent innovation is the gain of cardenolide toxins in the Brassicaceae genus Erysimum, which resulted in the effective deterrence of most herbivores by these plants. Nonetheless, some herbivores continue to attack Erysimum, likely by tolerating cardenolide defences through general detoxification mechanisms that may serve as evolutionary stepping-stones for more specialized resistance. 2. We investigated the interaction between diamondback moth (DBM, Plutella xylostella) and its occasional host plant E. cheiranthoides, by first screening the standing variation in DBM performance, and second by experimentally evolving DBM populations for increased performance on Erysimum. Despite considerable variation among wild DBM populations, larvae consistently avoided Erysimum leaves for feeding, and when constrained to Erysimum, they exhibited reduced growth rate, survival, and lower adult size compared to individuals feeding on control broccoli plants. 3. Surprisingly, cardenolides could only partly explain the reduced performance of DBM on Erysimum, and experimental evolution failed to improve overall performance. Instead, phenotypes of evolved lines converged on what appears to be a pre-existing, highly plastic phenotype found among wild DBM ancestors and which is characterized by rapid development and high weight gain on control plants, but slow development and low weight gain on Erysimum. 4. Although DBM failed to evolve improved performance on Erysimum, our results demonstrate that its existing genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity are evidently sufficient to support long-term development on Erysimum, thereby fulfilling a key condition for the future evolution of specialized adaptations.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

To uncover the molecular basis of toxin resistance in the black-headed grosbeak (Pheuticus melanocephalus), a specialist predator of cardiotonic steroid-defended monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), we investigated the evolution of target-site insensitivity in the toxin's molecular target--the Na,K-ATPase. Functional assays of engineered Na,K-ATPases revealed that resistance in grosbeaks arises from a non-additive interaction between a substitution at position 111 (Q111E) and up to six nearby amino acid changes in the first extracellular loop of the protein. Using resurrected ancestral proteins, we show that the earliest of these six substitutions to evolve (V113L) altered the functional effects of Q222E, such that Q111E alone became maladaptive. Only after the accumulation of additional permissive substitutions could Q111E confer resistance, highlighting how intramolecular epistatic interactions and historical contingency constrained the evolutionary path to adaptation. Our phylogenetic analysis of Na,K-ATPase sequences from 360 birds further revealed that several of the specific grosbeak substitutions--particularly at sites 112, 114, and 116--show strong signatures of co-evolution with changes at site 111 across the avian tree, supporting the hypothesis that resistance evolves through repeated, interacting changes.

Linear and linear mixed models were fitted to extract the fraction of variance allocated to multiple factors such as dam, family, sex, reproductive status and epiline. The latter was found to be significantly associated with body weight and with heart, abdominal fat and testicle weight adjusted by body weight. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the epiline progressively increased from the first generation (G0) to the last (G2), leading - for example in body weight at slaughter - to an average difference for adult males and females in G2 of 9 grams and 14 grams respectively, between genistein treated offspring (epi+) and controls (epi-). These findings suggest a possible transgenerational effect of the initial diet disruption. In tissue weights, production and behavioural traits, the effect of the epiline accounted for smaller fractions of phenotypic variability and overall large residual variances were observed, underlining the complex nature of the analysed traits.

We discovered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with tree height, wood density, carbon isotope composition and stem form. Using genome-wide SNP we predicted variation in several phenotypic traits of trees with a similar genetic background and estimated the breeding values of 148 selected plus trees. We identified loci associated with adaptation to source local environments. We used these loci to forecast adaptation to each trial site and future predicted conditions at source. Comparison of these forecasts to phenotypic performance in the trials suggests that genomic forecasts of adaptation to future climates should be interpreted with caution.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

However, existing deep learning models often fail to generalize to novel proteins with low sequence similarity to training data. Here, we present a mechanism-aware deep learning framework to enhance generalization by incorporating residue-level interaction modeling. Our model integrates a dual-attention-based PPI prediction module with an inter-protein contact predictor based on protein language model-embedded geometric graphs. Joint training on structure-informed PPIs from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) enables the model to predict both interactions and the key residue pairs that mediate them. The model generalizes well to unseen proteins across species in the high-quality interactome dataset (HINT). Fine-tuning on Homo sapiens PPI data from HINT further improves the performance. Compared to D-SCRIPT, Topsy-Turvy, and TT3D, our model, referred to as PLMDA-PPI, achieves superior accuracy and robustness under strict sequence dissimilarity settings.

Here, we profiled 54 cancer cell lines and found that Pol{theta}i induces significant radiosensitisation in most models, though with marked variability not explained by indicators of Pol{theta} activity. To pinpoint molecular determinants of radiosensitisation by Pol{theta}i, we performed a CRISPR knockout screen which revealed loss of the TP53BP1/Shieldin pathway component SHLD2 (FAM35A) as a vulnerability to Pol{theta}i combined with RT. We demonstrated that SHLD2 loss not only increases sensitivity to RT alone, but also enhances the radiosensitising effect of Pol{theta}i, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we found that SHLD2 is deleted in a subset of human prostate cancers, often co-occurring with PTEN loss, an adverse prognostic factor. Furthermore, we show that SHLD2-deficient cancer cells are more reliant on Pol{theta} to prevent DSB accumulation and chromosomal instability. In summary, we discovered SHLD2 loss as a novel collateral vulnerability that can be exploited through combined treatment with Pol{theta}i and RT.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Analysing over 5,000 pan-cancer patients with clinical and pre-/post-treatment genomic and transcriptomic data, we identify distinct immunogenomic drivers of acquired vs. primary ICB resistance. Post-ICB progression, acquired resistance showed extended survival compared to primary resistance across all cancer types. The acquired resistance clinical phenotype was paralleled by a universally immune-inflamed, albeit dysfunctional, tumour microenvironment (TME) at the onset of acquired resistance, with sustained or ICB-induced inflammatory and interferon responses. We confirm previously described mechanisms of acquired resistance, including B2M loss-of-function (LoF) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and identify novel potential mediators, including LoF of TGFBR2 in NSCLC, CYLD in head and neck cancer, and RUNX1 in triple negative breast cancer. Further supporting their involvement in resistance, these acquired ICB alterations associated with immune-escaped TMEs, characterised by active immunomodulatory oncogenic signalling, hyperproliferation and invasiveness, or altered tumour metabolism.

However, kinematic patterns of locomotion, even when animals move at a near-constant mean speed, frequently vary with both the physical and biological context. Here we demonstrate, using analyses of fish locomotion and energetics, how variation among individuals in kinematic gaits can manifest as changes in dynamics of metabolic rate (estimated from oxygen uptake). We present kinematic data from a small school of giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus) to show that fish within a school frequently modulate their kinematics and change position, even when the school moves at an overall constant mean speed. We show that rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), swimming over a range of speeds, exhibit considerable variation in tail beat frequency and metabolic rate among speeds. By experimentally altering the fluid dynamic environment, we demonstrate that brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) show correlated modulation of both kinematics and metabolic rate.

C.", "abstract": "Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, which modulate atherosclerosis, include two groups; invariant (iNKT) and variant (vNKT). These subsets differentially regulate the disease progression. Yet, the role of vNKTs in atherosclerosis remains unclear. We induced atherosclerosis by feeding high-fat diet (HFD) to Apoe-/- and analyzed the vNKTs in the liver and spleen. The vNKTs were termed non-iNKTs since they were negatively selected within the NKT population. Available literature suggests NKTs as lipid-recognizing cells; however, to our surprise, the non-iNKT numbers and phenotype remained unchanged between HFD-fed and chow-fed Apoe-/-. This was a blindsiding and unexpected outcome of the non-iNKTs being unaltered and unaffected with or without HFD, indicating no observable impact of atherosclerosis on these subsets. Albeit remaining unperturbed by atherosclerosis, these non-iNKTs demonstrated an identical but unique increase and upregulated activation in both the chow and HFD-fed Apoe-/-. These results instigated an investigation of the baseline correlation of the non-iNKTs between young C57BL/6 (WT) and Apoe-/-. Previously unknown and confounding results revealed upregulated activation and increased non-iNKT numbers but decreased IL-4+ non-iNKTs in the Apoe-/- compared to WT. Furthermore, HFD-fed WT that developed dyslipidemia, elucidated increased hepatic non-iNKTs and splenic IFN-gamma+ non-iNKTs compared to chow-fed WT controls. These results were not perceived in chow and HFD-fed Apoe-/-. Although lipid-responsive, non-iNKTs in Apoe-/- mice failed to respond to lipid stress, unlike those in dyslipidemic WT mice. These findings reveal that loss of Apoe, rather than atherosclerosis itself, drives altered non-iNKT biology. Thus, Apoe deficiency intrinsically dysregulates non-iNKTs, masking disease-associated immune changes. Apoe loss alters non-iNKT number and function, independent of atherosclerosis, and challenges the interpretation of immune responses by NKT subsets in Apoe-/- models. Therefore, this study warrants the use of Apoe null mice in studying NKT cells.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

This led us to hypothesize that HSV-2 UL13 requires viral cofactors for full kinase activity and prompted us to identify such cofactors. Our results were as follows. (i) Co-expression of UL13 with UL55 or Us10 significantly enhanced phosphorylation of EF-1{delta} compared to UL13 alone. (ii) UL13 was co-precipitated with UL55 or Us10 upon co-expression, and its kinase activity was significantly increased in their presence, as demonstrated by in vitro kinase assays. (iii) In HSV-2-infected cells, UL13 was specifically co-precipitated with Us10 and UL55. (iv) The UL55-null mutation significantly reduced phosphorylation of EF-1{delta} in HSV-2-infected cells, whereas the Us10-null mutation had little effect; however, the double-null mutation further decreased the phosphorylation compared to the UL55-null mutation alone. (v) The UL55-null mutation, but not the Us10-null mutation, significantly reduced HSV-2 replication and cell-cell spread in U2OS cells to levels comparable to those observed with the UL13 kinase-dead mutation. These results suggest that UL55 acts as a principal activator of UL13 in HSV-2-infected cells, whereas Us10 serves as an auxiliary activator. Moreover, the role of UL13 kinase activity in HSV-2 replication and cell-cell spread in U2OS cells appears to be largely dependent on UL55.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

This study investigates the impact of hypoosmolarity on different groups of ammonia oxidizers in soil and lake environments, as well as in pure culture isolates. In soil microcosms amended with ammonium, at low salinity levels (~120 S/cm), comparable to values commonly found in pristine terrestrial and aquatic environments, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), dominated by Nitrosomonas oligotropha, significantly increased. In contrast, the growth of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), dominated by \"Ca. Nitrosotenuis\" of the Nitrosopumilaceae family, was stimulated by high salinity (~760 S/cm). In ammonium-fed lake microcosms, the abundance of AOB, dominated by N. oligotropha, significantly increased under both low (~170 S/cm) and high salinity (~850 S/cm) conditions. In the presence of allylthiourea, a bacterial nitrification inhibitor, AOA were sensitive to low salinity in both soil and lake microcosms. Consistently, pure culture studies revealed marked growth inhibition of AOA, especially members of Nitrosopumilaceae, under hypoosmolarity, unlike AOB and complete ammonia oxidizer (comammox) strains. Comparative genomic analyses with AOB and comammox, along with transcriptomic studies, suggested that the sensitivity of AOA to hypoosmolarity stress was possibly due to a lack of sophisticated osmoregulatory transport systems and their S-layer cell wall structure. Overall, this study highlights hypoosmolarity as a key factor shaping the ecological niches and distribution of ammonia oxidizers, as well as nitrification activities, in terrestrial and aquatic environments that are increasingly affected by intensified water cycles due to climate change.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

It remains unclear whether the fungi detected in the gut are predominantly residents of the gastrointestinal tract or if they are largely transient and pass through. To address this question, we sought to determine whether host factors (e.g., sex) or external environmental factors (e.g., variable climatic conditions and diet) were more strongly correlated with the gut mycobiome of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a primate species living in the semi-arid Caatinga biome of northeastern Brazil. A stronger correlation with host factors, would suggest a more resident mycobiome, while a stronger association with external environmental factors suggests a more transient mycobiome. We collected 52 marmoset fecal samples across a 2-year period and DNA metabarcoding was used to assess both the mycobiome and diet of each sample. We used FUNGuild to assign ecological roles to the fungi, which were sorted into resident (e.g. animal pathogens) and transient (e.g. plant pathogens) groups. We found that mycobiome richness and evenness varied by host sex and correlated with the arthropod component of the diet while mycobiome composition varied between wetter and drier periods and correlated with the plant portion of the diet. The fact that external environmental factors were associated with the presence of specific taxa led us to conclude that the mycobiome is largely made up of transient taxa.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

We found that prior RSV infection- induced heterologous protection against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection was dose and time dependent. RNA-seq and immunological analyses revealed that RSV triggered the activation of lung antigen presenting cells (APC)s and SARS-CoV-2 reactive mucosal T cells at day 9, which declined at 1 month.

One particular species is the bluntnose sixgill shark, Hexanchus griseus, which has recently become more prominent in sightings and landings. Because of its deep range, H. griseus is difficult to study in situ so we used opportunistic data from sharkPulse, a crowd-sourcing platform that collects and organizes image-based shark occurrence records from all over the world, to better understand the abundance and distribution of H. griseus over the past decade. Additionally, we explored historical data to create a baseline of the species' abundance starting from the late 1800s. We found that H. griseus underwent a quadratic-shaped change in their abundance where they started out as a rare catch, became increasingly more prominent in fisheries data, and now is declining like many other cartilaginous fishes in the Mediterranean Sea.

Less understood are microbial aryl-sulfate sulfotransferases (ASSTs), which catalyze sulfo transfer reactions, without utilizing PAPS as a donor. Currently, the identity of physiological sulfo donor substrates remains unknown and sulfo acceptor substrates are underexplored. With this study, we aim to understand the potential contribution of a gut microbial enzyme to sulfonation chemistry by uncovering substrate preferences. Here, we show that a sulfotransferase (BvASST) from the prevalent gut microbe Bacteroides vulgatus (now Phocaeicola vulgatus) is a versatile catalyst that utilizes a wide range of phenolic molecules as substrates that are commonly encountered by the host. With this action, it has the ability to modulate concentrations of donor phenolic sulfates like acetaminophen sulfate, dopamine sulfate, p-coumaric acid sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and p-cresol sulfate in vitro. Moreover, we report a large adaptability in the acceptor preferences with the evidence of sulfonation for many biologically relevant phenolic molecules including p-coumaric acid, p-cresol, dopamine, acetaminophen, tyramine, and 4-ethylphenol. These results suggest that such gut microbial enzymes may impact the detoxification of a variety of phenolic molecules in the host, which were previously thought to be solely detoxified via human sulfotransferases. However, further in vivo studies are necessary to understand potential contributions of ASSTs in host detoxification processes.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Among stromal constituents, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as key regulators of antitumor immunity2-5. Here, we identify a distinct subset of CAFs in both murine and human stroma-rich cancers that secrete osteoprotegerin (OPG)--a soluble decoy receptor that neutralizes receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), both of which are involved in T cell function. In vitro, OPG directly impairs CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of target cells. In murine models of pancreatic and breast cancer, antibody-mediated blockade of OPG promotes robust immune infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, leading to significant tumor regression. Stromal profiling revealed that OPG blockade induces a shift in CAF cells--reducing immunosuppressive OPG+ fibroblasts while expanding interferon-responsive fibroblasts, thus recalibrating the tumor stroma toward a pro-immunogenic landscape. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of stromal immune suppression and highlight OPG as a stromal immune checkpoint controlling CD8+ T cell infiltration. Targeting OPG may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to convert immunologically \"cold\" tumors into T cell-infiltrated, tumor microenvironment.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

The method demonstrated high precision (<15% RSD intra-/inter-day) and recovery (85 - 115% across all QC levels). To demonstrate biological applicability, UCL-MetIsoLib was applied to a case study comparing healthy and colorectal cancer-derived organoids. The method enabled confident annotation of metabolite isomers, including key glycolytic intermediates such as DHAP and GA3P, as well as sugar phosphates from the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways. Metabolic alterations were observed in tumor organoids, including accumulation of nucleotide derivatives and shifts in central carbon metabolism.

Such scans are often analyzed using software such as Invicro VivoQuant or OsiriX as 3D images by manual labeling sites of PET signal using 2D slices and by reporting maximal SUV either of the whole lung or of individual lesions. Here we propose a pipeline for analysis of the same PET/CT scans using Imaris, a proprietary software typically used for analysis of data from fluorescent microscopy experiments. We show that by using locations of spine vertebra (denoted as \"landmarks\") we can align serials scans of the same animal, and by using automated (with some manual corrections) image segmentation in 3D as \"surfaces\", we can accurately define location of all sites of inflammation in the lung and lung-associated thoracic lymph nodes (LNs). We show that there is an excellent correlation between individual lesion's maximum SUV determined by Invicro VivoQuant and maximum intensity determined by Imaris suggesting utility of this approach. Imaris also provides wealth of additional information for each of the identified lesions such as volume, location, shape, surface area, and others, and each lesion can be exported in Virtual Reality file format (.wrl) allowing for detailed and rigorous analyses of how features of these PET-defined lesions evolve over time and correlate with the outcome of infection and/or treatment.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Although RXLR-EER motifs are critical for host translocation and are cleaved prior to secretion, the relevance of this processing is poorly understood. Prior evidence suggests RXLR effectors utilize a distinct, unconventional secretion pathway, raising the question of whether the RXLR-EER motifs influence selection of the secretion route. Here, we combined genetic, molecular and cell biology approaches to investigate the secretion pathways of RXLR effectors. Confocal microscopy revealed that RXLR and apoplastic effectors localize to distinct vesicular compartments in cultured hyphae. Moreover, fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to RXLR effectors did not impair their secretion, in contrast to apoplastic effectors, which were retained in the endomembrane system, indicating that RXLR effectors bypass the canonical ER-to-Golgi pathway. Importantly, RXLR effectors associate with extracellular vesicles, whereas RXLR-EER motif mutants show reduced association and are rerouted through the ER-to-Golgi secretion pathway. These findings demonstrate that the RXLR-EER motif governs effector sorting into an unconventional, EV-linked secretion route.

During growth on HMOs, bacteria produce beneficial metabolites including short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are important for host health. Select gut microorganisms have unique sets of enzymes capable of catabolizing distinct HMOs leading to host-specific differences in glycan access, and ultimately differences in SCFA production. Here we cultivated three species of human-associated Akkermansia, an early life commensal that is correlated with a healthy metabolic status in adults, on five individual HMOs in two different media backgrounds. Analysis of growth rates, growth yield, metabolic output, and individual HMO consumption through time revealed differences across species that was influenced by growth media. Most notably, A. biwaensis CSUN-19 has robust growth in both media backgrounds paired with nearly complete degradation of all HMOs. Across all conditions, overall SCFA production was generally commensurate with growth, but most strikingly, A. muciniphila MucT and A. biwaensis CSUN-19 produced succinate only when grown in the presence of N-acetyl glucosamine, but not with mucin. The third organism tested, A. massiliensis CSUN-17 had weaker growth, lower degradation of HMOs, but higher production of propionate in media containing N-acetyl glucosamine. Interactions between Akkermansia and HMOs can influence colonization of other early life commensals, potentially influencing health outcomes throughout life.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by such fungi act as semiochemicals that inhibit pathogens, with VOC production influenced by physical interactions between competing fungi. This study explores the interaction between the beneficial soil fungus Trichoderma hamatum GD12 strain (GD12), previously shown to antagonize crop pathogens such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, to test the hypothesis that its antagonistic effect is mediated by volatile chemical signalling. A GD12 mutant deficient in the chitinolytic enzyme N-acetyl-{beta}-glucosaminidase {Delta}Thnag::hph, which shows reduced biocontrol activity, was also examined. RESULTS: In dual-culture confrontation assays, co-inoculation of GD12 and S. sclerotiorum led to fungistatic interactions after 7 days, whereas {Delta}Thnag::hph showed no antagonism, indicating a loss of antagonistic function. VOCs collected from individual and co-cultures were analysed by gas chromatography - flame ionization detector (GC-FID) analysis and coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), revealing significant differences in VOC production between treatments, with VOC production notably upregulated in the GD12 + S. sclerotiorum co-culture. Peak production of 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one occurred 17 days post-inoculation. This upregulation was absent in the {Delta}Thnag::hph co-culture, suggesting VOCs may drive antagonism. Synthetic VOC assays revealed several compounds inhibitory to S. sclerotiorum, including 1-octen-3-one, which also arrested the growth of key fungal pathogens (Botrytis cinerea, Pyrenopeziza brassicae, and Gaeumannomyces tritici). Structural insights into 1-octen-3-one's antifungal activity against S. sclerotiorum are also presented. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that the antagonistic properties of T. hamatum GD12 against crop fungal pathogens can, in part, be attributed to VOC production. Further research is needed to assess the potential of these semiochemicals as tools for pathogen management in agriculture.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

To infect a bacterial host, a phage needs to bind to the bacterial surface via receptor binding proteins (RBPs), which are critical for determining host specificity. For functionally important receptors, the RBP-receptor interaction could be exploited via phage steering, where emerging bacterial resistance due to receptor modification could make bacteria less fit or virulent. Despite this, relatively little is known about RBP-receptor interactions. Here we build on the recent discovery of coliphages that have the outer membrane (OM) lipopolysaccharide translocon LptDE as their terminal receptor and show via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) that, surprisingly, the RBP of the small siphophage Oekolampad binds to a hitherto unobserved, open state of LptDE. The open lateral gate of LptD is occupied by a b-strand peptide originating from the degraded N-terminal jellyroll domain of LptD, suggesting the possibility of LptD inhibition via peptidomimetics. A structure of LptDE in complex with the superinfection exclusion (SE) protein Rtp45 of the Oekolampad-related phage Rtp shows a mechanism of SE where Rtp45-induced conformational changes in LptD resulting from steric clashes preclude RBP binding. Finally, analysis of spontaneous Oekolampad-resistant E. coli mutants identifies mutations in LptD that abolish the LptDE-RBP interaction in vitro. SDS-EDTA sensitivity assays of the mutants show no major defects in LptDE function, suggesting that phage steering via LptDE might be challenging.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

However, these techniques often struggle with high-dimensional data, where the increasing number of features leads to decreased performance, also affecting models accuracy. To address this problem, we explore hyperdimensional computing (HDC), an emerging brain-inspired computational paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vectors and simple arithmetic operations to represent and manipulate complex patterns, as an alternative approach in the context of supervised machine learning. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of HDC against established machine learning techniques across a range of classification tasks. As a representative use case, we focus on classifying heterogeneous metagenomic samples based on their quantitative microbial profiles, using publicly available microbiome datasets. Our results demonstrate that HDC achieves comparable, and in some cases, superior classification accuracy to classical methods. Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential of HDC for improved computational efficiency, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets, suggesting the HDC-based classifier as a promising tool for bioinformatics research, particularly in areas characterized by high-dimensional data. We also offer a Galaxy powered toolset to analyze your own datasets and generate reproducible workflows and adopt these methods in your own research with ease. Our investigation into the application of a HDC-based supervised machine learning technique for classifying microbial profiles in metagenomic samples yielded promising results, demonstrating the potential of this novel computational paradigm to complement and, in some cases, surpass the performances of well established machine learning techniques.

A total of 155 uORFs were identified as being essential for cell proliferation. These uORFs showed a high cell-type specificity, with only a few being universally essential. Subsequent analysis has revealed that the primary reason underlying the uORF essentiality is not encoded micropeptides, but rather cis-regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, uORFs located within short 5' UTRs were disproportionately sensitive to frameshift-inducing indels, which frequently lead to the uORF extension and overlap with the coding region (CDS), resulting in translational repression.

RR2b was artificially selected during domestication and improvement, and its expression levels correlate with ATT repeat polymorphisms in its promoter. Most wild soybeans and landraces have either more or less ATT repeats: more lead to weak RR2b expression with lower yield and enhanced resistance to soybean bacterial blight, and fewer cause strong RR2b expression, higher yield but reduced disease resistance.

We focus on periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), a superfamily of dynamic proteins that change conformation from open to closed states in response to binding their small-molecule ligands. We find that the space of allowed mutations computed for one conformation is incompatible with the other. We therefore constrained putative conformational hinge points and interface residues and filtered out incompatible mutations.

Here, we conducted a 103-day field experiment to assess the effects of two effective microorganisms commercial products supplementations on microbial communities and growth performance of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Effective microorganisms were added both to feed and directly to pond water. Microbial diversity was analysed using 16S rRNA and whole-genome shotgun sequencing across three environments - water (three time points), sediment (two time points) and fish intestine (one time point) - from 25 experimental ponds. Bioinformatics processing involved QIIME2 and MG-TK pipeline with taxonomic classification based on the SILVA database. The results showed that although supplemented bacterial families did not establish significantly in pond environments, fish exposed to specific effective microorganisms treatments exhibited improved growth metrics. These findings suggest that effective microorganisms can enhance carp growth in aquaculture without significantly altering resident microbial communities, offering a promising residue-free alternative to traditional additives.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

Pregnant outbred mice were infected with A/bovine/Ohio/B24OSU-472/2024 during the second or third trimester equivalent. Second trimester infection caused in utero infection, with infectious virus detected in the uterus, placenta, and fetus. Birth following third trimester infection resulted in offspring with decreased size and neurodevelopmental delays, with infectious virus detected in the neonatal milk ring and lungs as well as mammary tissues. Ongoing H5N1 infections present increased risk for human exposure and an H5N1 vertical transmission model in placental mammals is essential for understanding viral spread and evaluating treatments during pregnancy.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Evolutionary dynamics of the vertebrate Wnt gene repertoire", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.04.663182", "authors": "Fogg, L. G.; Policarpo, M.; Salzburger, W.", "abstract": "The Wnt gene family plays a central role in vertebrate development, yet its evolutionary dynamics across lineages remain largely unexplored. Here, we present the most comprehensive analysis of Wnt gene evolution in vertebrates to date, leveraging a large-scale comparative genomics approach of 38,886 Wnt gene sequences mined from 1,961 species. We first investigate overall patterns of gene retention, duplication, and loss, and then focus specifically on the impact of whole-genome duplications (WGDs). We uncover striking variation in Wnt gene repertoire sizes, with ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) exhibiting the largest repertoires - even after excluding taxa with recent WGDs. Notably, we identify extreme expansions in polyploid cyprinids, including an octoploid hybrid harbouring 99 Wnt genes, the highest number observed. Unexpectedly elevated Wnt copy numbers in diploid species, such as the Antarctic lanternfish (Electrona antarctica) and the brook lamprey (Lethenteron reissneri), point to lineage-specific expansions with potential adaptive significance. Evolutionary rate analyses reveal that certain Wnt clades - especially Wnt8 and Wnt16 - exhibit elevated dN/dS ratios and high birth-death rates, indicative of repeated episodes of relaxed constraint or adaptive diversification. Contrary to our expectations, there was no relationship between developmental expression timing and evolutionary rates, suggesting pleiotropic regulation and functional redundancy of Wnt genes. Altogether, our findings reveal pervasive, lineage-specific remodelling of Wnt gene repertoires, shaped by both genome duplication history and divergent evolutionary trajectories. This work provides a high-resolution framework for understanding the molecular evolution of a key developmental toolkit and highlights candidate genes for future studies of vertebrate eco-morphological diversity.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}
{"title": "The evolution of tandem repeat sequences under partial selfing and different modes of selection", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.04.663195", "authors": "Sudbrack, V.; Mullon, C.", "abstract": "Tandem repeat sequences (TRs) occur when short DNA motifs are repeated head-to-tail along chromosomes and are a major source of genetic variation. Population genetics models of TR evolution have focused on large, randomly mating, haploid populations. Yet many organisms reproduce partially through self-fertilisation (\"selfing''), which increases homozygosity and thus may alter the evolutionary processes shaping TRs. Here we use mathematical modelling and simulations to study the evolution of homologous TRs in partially selfing, diploid populations under four different selective regimes that may be relevant to TRs: (i) additive purifying selection, (ii) truncation-like purifying selection, (iii) selection against heterozygotes due to misalignment costs, and (iv) stabilising selection favouring an intermediate TR length. We show that selfing influences TR evolution primarily by increasing homozygosity, with two main consequences: (1) it enhances the variation produced by unequal recombination within individuals, and (2) it increases variation between individuals. Consequently, selection against TR expansions becomes more effective under partial selfing across all modes of selection considered, resulting in shorter TRs and lower genetic load, despite higher genetic drift. Overall, our results suggest that mating systems and inbreeding are important factors shaping variation in TRs.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}

They usually form a tetradecameric structure that assists, coupled to ATP hydrolysis, 10% of all cellular protein folding. Using recombinant E. coli, human mitochondrial and M. tuberculosis chaperonins, we found that these proteins have thioesterase, esterase and even, for some of them, auto-acyltransferase activities. The smaller oligomers of Hsp60 and M. tuberculosis GroEL1 were more prone to use the long acyl carbon chain substrate palmitoyl-CoA compared to tetradecameric E. coli GroEL and Hsp60. Enzymatic competition and replacement of M. tuberculosis GroEL1 residues allow identifying Asp86 and Thr89 in the ATP-binding pocket and an additional Ser393 influencing the thioesterase activity. Additionally, M. tuberculosis GroEL1 might enhance palmitoylation of the PpsE protein, which plays a role in the phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) biosynthesis. This could explain at least partly the involvement of GroEL1 in PDIM biosynthesis and antibiotic resistance.", "date": "2025-07-07", "journal": ""}
