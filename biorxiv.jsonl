A.; Richardson, J.", "abstract": "In Europe, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is responsible for severe neurological disease in humans. Like other viruses, TBEV is an obligate intracellular life form whose survival requires subversion of metabolic processes and evasion of anti-viral pathways. This feat is achieved in no small part by binary interactions between dedicated viral proteins and host proteins. Such protein-protein interactions (PPI) constitute molecular determinants of critical pathobiologic traits of viruses, including host-range, zoonotic potential and virulence, and represent realistic targets for anti-viral therapies. To shed light on the pathobiology of TBEV in human, we have resolved the network of PPI established with its human host by interaction proteomics. A high-throughput screen for virus-host PPI was performed involving the complete set of open reading frames of TBEV and the cDNA libraries of Homo sapiens, by means of yeast two-hybrid methodology. We have discovered a large set of virus-host protein-protein interactions concerning 42 different human proteins directly interacting with nine viral proteins. Many of these human interactors have never been linked in the literature to viral infection. The functional significance of the host interactors in viral infection as viral dependency or restriction factors was then characterized in vitro by RNA interference, and their function inferred by bioinformatic analysis. Approximately 40% of the identified human proteins have a significative impact on TBEV viral replication. These are engaged in many biological processes, whose involvement in viral infection is expected for many, but enigmatic for some. Further work will be necessary to gain molecular understanding of how these biological processes support or restrict TBEV replication, and whether they constitute viral vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence suggests that binding of Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) to the cytoskeleton or adhesions mediate feedback regulation to spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation. To explore such feedback regulation, we study the Rho specific GAP Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1) which binds to focal adhesions (FAs) through mechanosensitive interactions. Using a FRET biosensor, we show that DLC1 loss of function leads to global increase in Rho activity and contractility throughout the cell without affecting a striking lamellar RhoA activity band in fibroblasts. Although RhoA activity may appear steady at the population level, individual molecules are continually activated by GEFs, inactivated by GAPs, and diffusing between subcellular regions, a dynamic turnover referred to as \"signaling flux\". To directly measure this flux, we built a genetic circuit combining an optogenetic actuator to control Rho activity with a Rho activity biosensor. In spreading cells at steady state, optogenetic manipulation of Rho activity reveals that DLC1 controls the rate of Rho activation rather than duration, both at FAs and at the plasma membrane (PM). Local and reversible optogenetic control of contractility shows that DLC1 associates/dissociates with FAs during their reinforcement/relaxation. This might provide positive feedback that locally increases the rate of Rho activation at FAs that experience local tension to facilitate FA disassembly. Our results indicate that DLC1 operates both at the PM and at FAs to regulate global Rho activity levels at steady state, or to amplify local Rho activity at FAs experiencing a strong mechanical input, presumably to induce robust FA disassembly. This provides new insights in the complexity of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

During ageing, mitochondria accumulate defects that disrupt electron transport and elevate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) per unit of ATP. Here, we developed Drosophila melanogaster models carrying mitochondria that phenocopy aged organelles -termed 'aged-like' mitochondria- to dissect the developmental versus adult contributions of mitochondrial dysfunction to lifespan regulation. Inducing aged-like mitochondria during development caused profound metabolic maladaptation and markedly reduced adult lifespan, without signs of accelerated ageing. In contrast, restricting their expression to adulthood resulted in only a modest reduction in lifespan, accompanied by an increased mortality rate, indicative of accelerated ageing. Enhancing mitochondrial function exclusively during development by expressing the alternative oxidase (AOX) mitigated these metabolic defects and significantly extended adult survival. Likewise, developmental overexpression of Rheb, an activator of Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signalling, improved adult survival without restoring mitochondrial respiration. Finally, we show that mitochondrial respiratory capacity cannot be reinstated in adults with 'aged-like' mitochondria, as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein levels are largely established during development and remain stable throughout adult life. We propose that Drosophila permanently tunes adult metabolism according to developmental cues to optimise reproductive fitness, at the expense of long-term survival.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Using tumour spheroids invading the mesothelium as an experimental model of tissue invasion with theoretical and computational models, we uncovered the interplay between mechanics and biological processes, ranging from molecular to multicellular scales. For the first time, we visualised strands of intercellular integrin connections between the invasive leader cell and the tissue barrier, which triggers the active constriction of the cells within the tissue barrier. This active constriction shrinks the adhesive contacts between cells of the tissue barrier, eventually causing them to rupture. Instead of the established models of invading cells pushing through the tissue barrier or jamming transition-driven cell invasion, we show that a coordinated patterning of subcellular contractility by the invading spheroid and the tissue barrier drives cell invasion and barrier rupture. Our data reveals a mechanically active role for the tissue barrier in collective invasion, thus providing a new model for understanding tissue invasion and morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we explore how ancestral reconstruction may impact substrate scope in glycosidases, highly diverse enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in all living cells and find applications as catalysts of the reverse reaction. To this end, we screen a library of ~500 potential glycosidase substrates for degradation by both, a modern family-1 glycosidase from Halothermothrix orenii and a putative ancestral family-1 glycosidase derived from sequence reconstruction at a bacterial-eukaryotic common ancestor. The modern enzyme is the better catalyst for most substrates. But the ancestral glycosidase is more efficient with flavonoid glycosides bearing large aglycon moieties. Analysis of the catalytic parameters for a selected set of substrates, alongside analysis of the library data using a supervised learning algorithm, support the hypothesis that the modern enzyme tends to become less catalytically efficient with increasing substrate size, while this trend is not observed for the ancestral glycosidase. Molecular simulations support that the ancestral catalysis pattern is linked to the existence of a highly flexible region of the ancestral structure and a cavity capable of accommodating large aglycons.

Unlocking these mechanisms requires the ability to functionally map in living systems locale-specific stress-responder proteins and interrogate how chemical modification of each responder impacts proteome synthesis. We resolved this problem by integrating precision localized electrophile generation and genetic code expansion tools. Upon examination of four distinct subcellular locales, only nuclear-targeted electrophile stress stalled translation. We discovered that NCBP1, a nuclear-resident protein with multifaceted roles in eukaryotic mRNA-biogenesis, propagated this nuclear stress signal through a single cysteine (C436) from among its 19 conserved cysteines. This NCBP1(C436)-specific modification elicited alternative splicing of >250 genes. Mechanistically, global protein-synthesis stall was choreographed by impaired association between electrophile-modified NCBP1(C436) and SF3A1, an essential component of spliceosome, triggering the production of alternatively-spliced S6-kinase, whose expression was sufficient to dominantly inhibit protein translation.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

The SQM, along with other postdictive phenomena, thus provides a unique opportunity to dissociate unconscious from conscious stages of visual processing, as these stages are well separated in time. Using EEG during the SQM, we identified two distinct stages of neural activity: an early occipital EEG activity pattern (~200 ms after the initial vernier) associated with unconscious processing, and a later centro-parietal EEG pattern (~400-600 ms after SQM onset) associated with the integrated percept and behavioral report.

Transcription of hsbAR-hptB and cfcR is RpoS-dependent and induced by stationary phase and the stringent response. A delta-hsbA mutant resumed biofilm formation after dispersal in late stationary phase and displayed increased pellicle formation at the medium-air interphase and Congo Red adsorption. All these phenotypes were traced down to increased c-di-GMP levels in stationary phase, dependent on the activity of CfcR and its cognate sensor kinase, CfcA. HsbA was reversibly phosphorylated by the combined action of HptB and HsbR. HsbA phosphorylation conditioned its interaction with CfcR and CfcA and the intracellular distribution of the three proteins, but did not greatly influence biofilm regulation. Our results support a model in which HsbA forms a complex with CfcR to inhibit its DGC activity regardless of its phosphorylation state. Upon HsbA dephosphorylation, this complex is recruited to the cell membrane by CfcA to strengthen the inhibitory effect. While this pathway contributes to biofilm dispersal by denying de novo c-di-GMP synthesis during nutrient starvation, it may also enable quick restoration of the biofilm phenotype to colonize new sites or during biofilm maturation.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

The goal of this work was to evaluate the potential of photokilling in this wide-spread microbial adherent community type, and to decipher the specific mechanisms at stake. To investigate aBL killing efficiency, we conducted experiments in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm model using a well-defined millifluidic device that allows real-time microscopy and quantitative analysis of a living biofilm under local irradiation at a defined light dose. In addition, we developed a theoretical model for light-biofilm interaction that accounts for the three-dimensional nature of the bacterial biofilm. To inform our model, we examined the light dose-response in isolated cells and found a profile indicative of a multi-target mechanism of lethality. By comparing the experimental and theoretical results, we identified a loss in killing efficiency as the biofilm grows, due in part to the increase in thickness of the living material inherent to this mode of development. Our findings also highlight a reduction in the intrinsic bacterial sensitivity to blue light as biofilm development progresses, which we attribute to the low oxygen levels typical of densely populated bacterial environments.

We examined STDP dynamics in large recurrent networks in two stages. We first derived the effective dynamics of the order parameters of the synaptic connectivity. Then, a perturbative approach was applied to investigate stability. We show that for a wide range of parameters STDP can induce rhythmogenesis. Moreover, STDP can suppress synaptic fluctuations that disrupt functionality. Interestingly, STDP can channel fluctuations in the synaptic weights into a manifold on which the network activity is not affected, thus, maintaining functionality while allowing a subspace in which synaptic weights can be widely distributed.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

The evolutionary association of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) with host-beneficial genes is known to be hindered by the stability of chromosomal loci and competition with MGEs lacking accessory genes. Using a mathematical model that incorporates these constraints, we identify two key mechanisms that help overcome them, resulting in the evolutionary linkage of accessory genes, like virulence genes, to prophages. First, we show that migration across bacterial populations favours the association of genes with prophages when the gene is beneficial in certain environments (e.g. virulence genes in the gut) that also trigger higher rates of prophage induction. Second, we show that within-population spatial dynamics also promotes the association of weakly selected genes and phages.

In the accompanying paper (Jiang et al) we report development of a mass spectrometry-based method to reliably identify proline hydroxylation (OH-Pro) sites on proteins and use this to identify a PHD-dependent OH-Pro modification at Pro604 on the protein RepoMan (CDCA2), a regulatory subunit for protein phosphatase PP1{gamma}, with important roles in mitotic progression and cell viability. Here, we investigate the functional significance of hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604. During M phase, the PP1- RepoMan complex dephosphorylates Thr3 of Histone H3 (H3T3) on chromosomes arms to ensure the correct localisation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres. We show that siRNA depletion of PHD1, but not PHD2, increases H3T3 phosphorylation in prometaphase-arrested cells. In cells depleted of endogenous RepoMan, exogenous expression of wild type RepoMan, but not a RepoMan P604A mutant, restored normal H3T3 phosphorylation localisation in prometaphase arrested cells. RepoMan P604 is located proximal to the Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) that function as binding sites for the serine/threonine Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The interaction of RepoMan and PP2A-B56{gamma} is reduced in cells expressing RepoMan P604A.

However, efficient and lossless indexing of such structures remains challenging due to the scale and complexity of pangenomic data. We present a practical and scalable indexing framework based on tag arrays, which annotate positions in the Burrows--Wheeler transform (BWT) with graph coordinates. Our method extends the FM-index with a run-length compressed tag structure that enables efficient retrieval of all unique graph locations where a query pattern appears. We introduce a novel construction algorithm that combines unique k-mers, graph-based extensions, and haplotype traversal to compute the tag array in a memory-efficient manner. To support large genomes, we process each chromosome independently and then merge the results into a unified index using properties of the multi-string BWT and r-index. Our evaluation on the HPRC graphs demonstrates that the tag array structure compresses effectively, scales well with added haplotypes, and preserves accurate mapping information across diverse regions of the genome. This indexing method enables lossless and haplotype-aware querying in complex pangenomes and offers a practical indexing layer to develop scalable aligners and downstream graph-based analysis tools. The index additionally supports efficient one-to-all coordinate translation, enabling any interval on a haplotype to be mapped to its corresponding intervals across all other haplotypes in the graph.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

However, maintaining this balance becomes particularly challenging in postmitotic tissues, where alternative mechanisms replace compensatory proliferation. In the postmitotic retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), these mechanisms include significant structural adaptations over time. Yet, how these adaptations relate to epithelial mechanical homeostasis and age-associated functional decline remains poorly understood. To establish the relationship between structural changes, mechanical homeostasis and function, we developed an in vitro reductionistic model mimicking age-related reduction in RPE cell density. Inducing large-scale apoptosis in postmitotic stem cell-derived RPE monolayers recapitulates structural hallmarks of aged tissue, such as reduced cell height, shortened microvilli and cytoskeletal reorganisation. This new structure acquires a new mechanical equilibrium, evidenced by tissue stiffening and enhanced junctional contractility. Functionally, the monolayers display impaired vision-supporting phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Mechanistically, modulation of actin nucleators, Arp2/3 and formins, demonstrates that apicolateral monolayer deformation is critical for phagocytosis and may be compromised in aged RPE. Our findings suggest that a shift in mechanical homeostasis due to cell loss is a major driver of age-related RPE functional decline. Importantly, we show that structural remodelling in ageing alone can compromise tissue function, independent of other stressors.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate a photoswitchable covalent inhibitor for the MAP kinase JNK3, a target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The inhibitor, which is based on a diazocine photoswitch, can undergo reversible photoisomerization of a double bond, switching between two (meta-)stable isomers. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, comprising almost 40 s of total simulation time, reveal how the distinct conformational spaces of the two isomers modulate their interactions with JNK3 within the ATP-binding pocket. We show that only the metastable trans isomer can form a covalent bond with JNK3, thereby permanently inhibiting its function. In contrast, for the cis state the distance between the inhibitor and the targeted cysteine residue is too large to allow covalent bond formation. Furthermore, our simulations reveal that the covalent bond, in combination with the environment of the protein pocket, hinders the full back-relaxation of the trans isomer to the stable cis isomer. Finally, our data shows that the covalently bound stable cis isomer modulates the conformations of JNK3, mainly of its activation loop.

Bayesian phylodynamics integrates out phylogenetic uncertainty, which is typically substantial in phylodynamic datasets due to limited genetic diversity. Phylodynamic inference does not, however, scale with modern datasets, partly due to difficulties in traversing tree space. Here, we characterize tree space and landscape in phylodynamic inference and assess its impacts on analysis difficulty and key biological estimates. By running extensive Bayesian analyses of 15 classic large phylodynamic datasets and carefully analyzing the posterior samples, we find that the posterior tree landscape is diffuse yet rugged, leading to widespread tree sampling problems that usually stem from sequences in a small part of the tree. We develop clade-specific diagnostics to show that a few sequences---including putative recombinants and recurrent mutants---frequently drive the ruggedness and sampling problems, although existing data-quality tests show limited power to detect them. The sampling problems can significantly impact phylodynamic inferences or distort major biological conclusions; the impact is usually stronger on \"local\" estimates (e.g., introduction history) associated with particular clades than on \"global\" parameters (e.g., demographic trajectory) governed by general tree shape. We evaluate existing and newly-developed MCMC diagnostics, and offer strategies for optimizing phylodynamic analysis settings and mitigating sampling problem impacts. Our findings highlight the need and directions to develop efficient traversal over rugged tree landscapes, ultimately advancing scalable and reliable phylodynamics.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

These patterns are proposed to act as \"inhibitory stencils\" that constrain where sensory-related information (the \"content\" of cognition) can be expressed in spiking activity. Here, we provide a comprehensive empirical test of Spatial Computing using multi-electrode recordings from the lateral prefrontal cortex in non-human primates performing a range of cognitive tasks (object working memory, sequence working memory, categorization). We found that alpha/beta oscillations encoded task-related information, were organized into spatial patterns that changed with task conditions, and inversely correlated with the spatial expression of sensory-related spiking activity. Furthermore, we found that alpha/beta oscillations reflected misattributions of task conditions and correlated with subjects' trial-by-trial decisions. These findings validate core predictions of Spatial Computing suggesting that oscillatory dynamics not only gate information in time but also shape where in the cortex cognitive content is represented.

First, it can identify tissue regions where expression changes across conditions. Second, it can detect spatial gene expression pattern changes across more than two experimental conditions, with flexible models. With ad hoc simulations, we demonstrate that our approach has good true positive rates and well-calibrated false discovery rates.

A total of nine Fusarium species were isolated: F. incarnatum, F. equiseti, F. solani, F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, F. clavum, F. oxysporum, F. flocciferum, and one unidentified Fusarium sp. The highest species diversity (five species) was observed in Sherman County. Fusarium solani was the most frequently isolated species (39%) across all counties, followed by F. equiseti (22%), while F. flocciferum was the least frequently isolated species (2%). Greenhouse pathogenicity assays showed F. incarnatum caused significantly higher disease severity relative to non-inoculated control on aerial parts of cotton (P=0.0137), while Fusarium flocciferum, F. proliferatum, and F. clavum caused significantly higher disease severity relative to non-inoculated control on roots (P=0.01, P=0.01, P=0.02, respectively). On corn, differences in disease severity were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Fusarium isolates were recovered from both symptomatic and asymptomatic roots following pathogenicity trials, suggesting endophytic colonization. This study revealed a complex Fusarium community capable of cross-infecting cotton and corn, with implications for regional disease management.

Yet, such interactions remain poorly characterised in plant agroecosystems. Here, we investigate the ecological determinants of the interaction between a highly diverse set of 23 phages isolated from diseased apricot trees and 44 bacterial strains from the Pseudomonas syringae species complex collected either from diseased apricot trees, healthy plants or non-agricultural environment. Based on their ecological origin, we expected phages to preferentially infect bacterial strains from the same ecological context, forming modular host-range patterns. Contrary to these expectations, we discovered a significantly nested structure, suggesting generalised infection dynamics rather than local adaptation, primarily driven by the broad ecological dynamics of this pathosystem. Analysis of the bacterial genomes showed that both the profiles of anti-phage defence systems and the distribution profiles of prophages are strongly shaped by bacterial phylogeny. Furthermore, while the number of defence systems showed limited correlation with the breadth of bacterial sensitivity to phages, prophage abundance exhibited a strong, non-linear link with phage virulence. Together, these findings provide an ecological and evolutionary perspective on phage-bacterium infection networks and new insights into a better understanding of the role of phages in agricultural ecosystems.\n\nAuthor SummaryViruses that infect bacteria, known as phages, are part of microbial communities and influence the abundance, diversity, and traits of their hosts. In an agriculture-related context, they are commonly considered as potential biocontrol agents, but studying the bases of fundamental phage-bacterial interactions may help us better understand the plant microbiome and its applications. Many factors influence these interactions, and identifying which ones matter most remains a challenge. In our study, we investigated how phages from diseased plants interact with bacteria collected from diseased and healthy plants, as well as from surrounding environments. We expected phages to mainly infect bacteria from similar environments, but instead observed that they often infected bacteria regardless of their source. This suggests that phage activity in this system has few barriers, reflecting the wide ecological distribution of their bacterial hosts. We further investigated how bacteria defend against phages by identifying both defence systems and prophages within their genomes and using this information to explore their contribution to bacterial resistance or sensitivity to phages. Together, our findings offer new insights into how phage-bacterium relationships evolve and function in plant ecosystems.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Releasing this PGN is metabolically costly and potentially immune alarming and the benefits to B. pertussis are unclear. While TCT has been characterized as a potent NOD1 agonist capable of causing the extrusion of ciliated cells, in vitro, the consequences of its release have yet to be studied in vivo. Here we show that selective PGN release by B. pertussis biases host PGN sensing toward NOD1 and away from NOD2, suppressing IL1 driven inflammation and blunting adaptive immune recruitment. Mice infected with a TCT over-releasing strain (TCT(+)) exhibit reduced pulmonary immunopathology relative to wild type (WT) and a TCT-under-releasing strain (TCT(-)), despite similar bacterial burdens. NOD reporter assays demonstrate that TCT release enhances NOD1 activation and inversely correlates with NOD2 activation. Bulk transcriptomic analysis of infected lungs shows that B. pertussis PGN release dampens pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs. Single-cell transcriptomic determined Nod2 expression is limited to inflammatory myeloid subsets. IL1 family genes were highly enriched in Nod2 but not Nod1 expressing alveolar macrophages. Upstream regulator analysis predicted IL1 as a major driver of B. pertussis inflammation, which was enhanced by the absence of PGN release. Flow cytometry shows that PGN release skews macrophages polarization toward M2 and away from M1 in a NOD1 dependent manner. Finally, extracellular release of PGN and subsequent reduced IL1 production facilitated the suppression fibroblast chemokine programs (e.g., CXCL13, CCL19), diminished recruitment of B and T cells, reduced iBALT formation, and limited immune memory development. Conversely, IL-1R1 deficiency impairs adaptive recruitment and bacterial clearance despite similar innate infiltration.

While individual tau phosphorylation sites have been well-studied, how combinatorial phosphorylation impacts tau's behavior in both contexts is poorly understood. We hypothesized that contrasting developmental and pathological models of tau phosphorylation would yield insights into mechanisms of impaired neuronal resilience in tauopathies. We use transgenic PS19 tau mice to demonstrate that increases in individual tau phospho-epitopes with aging do not correlate with their enrichment in tau aggregates in these mice. Using seeded aggregation of tau in neurons, we observe that tau aggregate formation does not necessarily result in MT destabilization; instead, aggregation diminishes tau's ability to counteract destabilization when MTs are externally perturbed. We identify that combinations of tau phospho-signatures are responsive to MT destabilization, and phosphorylation at residues S235 and S262 as particularly critical for regulation of interactions with MTs. Phosphorylation of these residues was associated both with significantly reduced binding to MTs, as well as impaired phosphatase response in aggregates. As a whole, this work provides mechanistic insight into phospho-regulation of tau function and prompts reconsideration of the canonical view that tau phosphorylation precedes MT destabilization in disease. Rather, we provide compelling evidence that phosphorylation of tau may be a response to changes in MT stability and that cell death may result from aggregated tau's inability to function in this manner.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Such spatial control is fundamental to cellular behaviour in both physiological and pathological scenarios. In studying keratinocyte stemness, we previously identified a Mindin-M{beta}2 (CD11b/CD18) interaction that triggers STAT3 activation. Here, we delineate the mechanism underlying this response and show that the F-Spondin domain of Mindin constitutes the minimal integrin-binding module required to initiate downstream signalling. F-Spondin binding to the integrin at the plasma membrane does not elicit the full activation state of the integrin. Instead, it promotes Src kinase dependent endocytosis of the integrin receptor to the early endosomes. Analysis of integrin conformational dynamics reveals that this compartmental shift is essential as the acidic environment of early endosomes drives the transition into a signalling competent state. This mechanism extends to pathological contexts, as we demonstrate a requirement for endocytosis in activating STAT3 signalling and preserving stem-like properties in a cancer stem cell model.

Aged females seized faster than young females and experienced greater mortality, unlike males. There was no difference in KAR subunit expression between young mouse genotypes and regardless of seizure history. In both genotypes, hippocampal CA3 astrocytes expressed GluK5 after seizures, however, astrocytic GluK2 upregulation only occurred in WTs. GluK5 expression was significantly reduced in aged seizure-naive PSEN2 KO versus WT mice, while total GluK2 expression did not differ. Seizure-induced astrocytic GluK5 expression only occurred in WT mice in CA3, while astrocytic GluK2 expression occurred in both. Thus, PSEN2 loss may impair age-related hippocampal KAR expression, implicating KARs as understudied contributors to AD-related seizures.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

However, they often overlook crucial aspects of adaptation, including the long-term temporal evolutionary dynamics, the predictability of evolutionary outcomes, the influence of past evolution on future evolutionary trajectories (contingency), and the diversity of molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation. Experimental evolution has been a useful tool for answering these questions, but extracting fundamental principles and predictive features of evolutionary outcomes from these datasets remains challenging due to the large number of covariates and confounding effects, such as differences in experimental setup, species lifestyle, gene content, and evolution rate. Here, we sought to circumvent these challenges by comparing distant yeast species that share several evolutionary features but differ mainly in evolutionary history and genome architecture, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Thus, we evolved 10 populations of the fission yeast for 10,000 generations in the same conditions as a pre-existing budding yeast dataset (i.e. high-sugar media and hypoxic conditions), allowing us to observe repeatable evolutionary outcomes within species but diverse molecular mechanisms and targets of adaptation across species. The most frequent adapting route in these conditions involved upregulating fermentation genes and downregulating the glycolysis gene pyk1, which has not previously been observed in S. cerevisiae evolved populations or in wild Kluyveromyces lactis, but similar evolutionary paths have been observed in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus and in clinically relevant populations, such as some cancer cells. This suggests that parallelism is pervasive in the tree of life and that mechanisms of adaptation can be shared among closely related or distant species. Despite similar gene content and identical environments, recurrent adaptation across S. pombe populations involved different genes than in S. cerevisiae and was mostly detectable at the transcriptomic level. This suggests that trans-regulatory effects may play an important role in adaptation on short evolutionary timescales and that differences in evolutionary outcomes between these species may be attributed to contingency.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Objective: This study evaluated the hypothesis that baseline tissue oxygen (pO2) would modulate FLASH damage sparing in murine skin, comparing MeV electron ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) versus conventional dose rate (CDR) irradiations. Approach: Murine leg skin pO2 was systematically varied and measured during irradiation from a Mobetron 9 MeV linac at 25 Gy, comparing UHDR ({approx}240 Gy/s) to CDR ({approx}0.16 Gy/s), for skin damage outcomes. Radiolytic oxygen consumption, gO2 (mmHg/Gy), was also quantified in vivo. Baseline tissue pO2 was systematically modulated in 5 different treatment cohorts, using known methods of altering the inhaled gas (room air, 100% oxygen, or carbogen) and through applied limb vascular compression (partial or full). Induced skin damage was scored daily per mouse. Main Results: FLASH skin sparing was observed in groups with partial leg clamping (pO2=7{+/-}4mmHg), inhaled air (pO2=12{+/-}6mmHg) and oxygen (tissue pO2=16{+/-}4mmHg), while reduction in ulceration progression was significant just in the air inhalation group. No FLASH effect was observed at zero oxygen, via complete blood flow occlusion (pO2=0{+/-}1mmHg), or when modulated by inhaled carbogen (pO2=21{+/-}7mmHg). In vivo measurements of radiolytic consumption, gO2, correlated to initial pO2 when FLASH was present (pO2=4-16mmHg) and saturated above pO2>16mmHg. Inspired carbogen induced the highest pO2 and maximum damage at 25 Gy. Reductions in dose to 20 and 15 Gy reduced skin damage with carbogen, but did not result in FLASH sparing. Significance: These findings indicate that tissue pO2 directly modulates in vivo FLASH skin tissue sparing, requiring roughly room air or 100% oxygen anesthetic gas levels for this effect to be present. The effect is diminished by the absence of oxygen or from carbogen induced oxygen values. Variations in dose do not appear to alter this observation at carbogen induced pO2 levels.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

We provide a protocol that is able to predict whether any given disordered protein sequence will bind to microtubuli. This protocol is suitable for compound screening. Our pattern analysis allows us to establish two categories of strongly interacting subsequences that enable binding to microtubuli: positively charged hydrophobic clusters and alternating charge sequences. Their overall optimal balance is analyzed and preferential regions of interaction on microtubuli are identified and validated with known experimental results.

In mitosis, PI(4,5)P2 accumulation at the plasma membrane is essential for the recruitment of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the anchoring of the mitotic spindle at the plasma membrane. This is largely regulated by the function of kinases and phosphatases that interconvert phosphoinositide species. Here we demonstrate that during mitosis the ORP3 lipid transfer protein, which transfers PI4P from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), indirectly regulates PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane, in concert with the regulation by phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases. Phosphorylation of a secondary ORP3 binding domain to the VAPA ER membrane protein strongly recruits ORP3 to the ER, where it is primed for PI4P transfer at ER-plasma membrane contact sites. Defects in ORP3 function during mitosis result in abnormal PI(4,5)P2 distribution and actin cytoskeleton, mitotic spindle geometry, abnormal cell division, and various cell division phenotypes, which lead to aneuploidy and eventually to cell death or genomic instability.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Despite its clinical importance, no validated biomarkers or therapies directly target epithelial barrier restoration. We investigated whether hepatocyte nuclear factors HNF4 and HNF4{gamma} regulate tight junction (TJ) organization and barrier integrity in CD, and whether pharmacologic HNF4 activation can restore epithelial function.\n\nMethodsWe integrated our previously defined HNF4/{gamma}-regulated epithelial transcriptome with analyses of genetic (Hnf4/{gamma} double knockout) and inflammatory (Tnf{Delta}ARE/+) mouse models, human CD tissues, and patient derived organoids (PDOs). Barrier function was assessed by FITC-dextran flux and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Two plant-derived, non-toxic HNF4 agonists, N-trans-caffeoyltyramine (NCT) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (NFT), were tested for therapeutic rescue of barrier function in CD.\n\nResultsCombined loss of Hnf4/{gamma} impaired epithelial barrier function by activating both pore and leak pathway, with selective permeability to 4-10 kDa tracers. Integration with our transcriptomic data from the Hnf4/{gamma} double knockout (DKO) mice revealed broad repression of TJ-associated genes, including Tjp2 (encoding ZO-2), F11r (encoding JAM-A), MarvelD3, Cldn4, Cldn7, and Cldn15, together with induction of the pore-forming gene Cldn2. HNF/{gamma} proteins were markedly downregulated in CD intestinal epithelium and in PDOs established from non-inflamed mucosa, establishing that the barrier defect is epithelial-intrinsic and inflammation independent. In contrast, chronic TNF overexpression in the Tnf{Delta}ARE/+ mice phenocopied this suppression through a normally transient epithelial injury response that became pathologically stabilized under sustained cytokine signaling. Treatment of both CD PDOs and Tnf{Delta}ARE/+ mouse organoids with NCT or NFT reactivated HNF4/{gamma} expression, normalized TJ gene profile, and restored TEER to near-control levels.\n\nConclusionHNF4/{gamma} are master transcriptional regulators of epithelial TJ integrity whose loss defines a primary barrier defect in CD. Chronic inflammation can mimic but does not initiate this intrinsic defect. Pharmacologic activation of HNF4/{gamma} with plant-derived, non-toxic, translationally ready agonists (NCT and NFT) restore barrier function, establishing the first barrier-healing therapy for CD.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

The mechanisms coordinating cell growth with membrane synthesis in any organism are unclear. In Escherichia coli, initiation of phospholipid synthesis by the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase PlsB is regulated by cell growth via an unknown allosteric mechanism. Previous studies have established that PlsB assembles into enzymatically inactive, membrane-bound filaments when overexpressed. We propose that PlsB filamentation regulates PlsB activity and coordinates membrane synthesis with growth. Here, we test our hypothesis by observing the localization of fluorescently labelled PlsB using live-cell fluorescence microscopy. During growth, PlsB localizes as discrete foci, consistent with formation of inactive filaments. Reducing cellular membrane content eliminates PlsB foci and delocalizes PlsB into the cytoplasm. Restoring membrane synthesis causes PlsB foci to reform after a delay. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and suggest a model in which PlsB reversibly assembles into inactive filaments in response to phospholipid abundance. This mechanism establishes a negative feedback loop that controls initiation of phospholipid synthesis by PlsB and effectively coordinates membrane synthesis with growth.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Histone deacetylase HDA19 is a key epigenetic regulator in Arabidopsis, and hda19-deficient mutants display tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses, including drought, heat, and salinity. Using lysine acetylome profiling, we identified a non-canonical K27/K36 di-acetylation mark on histone H3.3, among nine H3 variants, as a specific substrate of HDA19. Under salinity stress, this mark decreased in wild-type plants but increased in hda19 mutants, while other known H3 modifications were similarly affected in both genotypes. Mimicking constitutive di-acetylation of H3.3 K27/K36 through lysine-to-glutamine substitutions promoted accumulation of stress-responsive late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and conferred salinity tolerance in seedlings, phenocopying hda19 mutants. Furthermore, generating the lea7-1/lea29-1/rab18-1 triple mutant abolished hda19-dependent salinity tolerance, confirming the role of LEA proteins downstream of HDA19.

Designing such overlaps is challenging due to codon degeneracy, phase-specific biases, and the need to preserve structural integrity for both proteins. Here, a purpose-built transformer encoder is introduced, trained on a balanced synthetic dataset of convergent overlaps spanning diverse prokaryotic genomes and GC contents. Controlled amino acid substitutions were incorporated during training to enhance model generalization, particularly for phase 1 overlaps. At inference, Monte Carlo dropout enabled uncertainty-aware sampling of synonymous codon solutions, which were iteratively refined using a windowed, multi-objective optimization framework. Candidate overlaps were scored using composite weighting across secondary structure preservation, substitution similarity, alignment identity, and ESM-2 contact map similarity, with SSIM applied as a rapid proxy for structural fidelity. This approach generated convergent overlaps across all phases, with phase 1 showing the highest success rates. Optimization trajectories revealed distinct dynamics, with secondary structure preservation steadily increasing despite its lower weight. External validation using SwissProt proteins stratified by AlphaFold2 pLDDT confidence supported generalization to proteins with differing rigidity, yielding high secondary structure preservation in silico. These results demonstrate that transformer models trained directly at the nucleotide level, when coupled with uncertainty-aware inference and lightweight structural proxies, can support the computational design of synthetic overlapping genes without requiring full structural prediction.

Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected and used to fit the feedback model and estimate feedback delay and gains. Results showed good model fits for both walking and standing with mean R2-values higher than 0.69. The feedback delay was significantly longer in walking than in standing. While the feedback position gains and velocity gains varied significantly across tasks and directions, position gains were mostly above critical stiffness and velocity gains all at under-damped level, with as only exception that position gains in the AP direction in walking, which were slightly below critical stiffness. The ratio of position to velocity gains in all tasks remained consistently close to the eigenfrequency (sqrt(g/l)) as predicted by the extrapolated center of mass concept.

Comparative study of the electron density maps of the capsids reveals the presence of protein appendages DarA and Hdf below the 5-fold symmetric region inside capsid_L that anchor the phage dsDNA to the capsid-shell. Such densities are also noticed in large capsids depleted off their dsDNA but not observed in capsid_S. Deficiency of these appendages in capsid_S results in a smaller sized dsDNA packed inside a reduced sized phage head.

T1 mapping was performed at high resolution (0.9-mm isotropic) to capture anatomical details of the CSF spaces and was also repeated more rapidly at a lower resolution (3-mm isotropic) to capture the temporal dynamics of T1 changes. Region-dependent reductions in T1 were observed, indicating increased oxygen concentration. These occurred most prominently and rapidly in the cortical subarachnoid space, stabilising within approximately 7 minutes of initiating hyperoxia, suggesting that oxygen diffusion primarily occurs via pial arteries. Slower changes, commencing after approximately 10 minutes, occurred in the posterior lateral ventricles, where choroid plexus is found.

While studies in animal models of heart disease suggest that preventing or reducing fibrosis can antagonize negative ventricular remodeling, current therapeutic strategies remain clinically limited and ineffective, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the multifactorial nature of the fibrotic process. Methods and Results: We employed artificial intelligence (AI) trained from 6528 cardiac fibrosis publications over the past decade, which suggested 10 nodal signaling pathways underlying the fibrotic process. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to quantify pathway activities across mouse models and clinical samples encompassing acute and chronic cardiac injury. Dynamic enrichment analysis revealed 2 critical pathways involved in acute myocardial infarction (MI) injury driven temporally-regulated fibrosis whereby Janus kinase - Signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling peaked early (day 7) while transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) pathway activity peaked mid-phase (day 14). With more chronically-driven fibrosis, JAK-STAT signaling again emerged, which this time was persistently active during chronic transverse aortic constriction (TAC) injury. Experimentally, single-cell analysis identified a pathogenic myofibroblast subpopulation characterized by high JAK-STAT signaling and ECM secretion capacity. Fibroblast-specific Jak1/2 gene-deleted mice significantly reduced TAC-induced fibrosis by blocking myofibroblast formation from this subpopulation, although these same mice failed to show attenuated fibrosis following MI injury, suggesting a pathway that would be ideal to therapeutically target for chronic fibrosis without affecting necessary acute scar formation. Indeed, based on the predictive AI driven algorithm, a temporal inhibitory strategy was generated for JAK-STAT and TGF-? that permitted compensatory scar formation while more effectively preventing progressive fibrosis and worsened cardiac function versus either singular pathway or chronic antagonism. Conclusion: Here we employed the wealth of past signaling pathway data underlying cardiac fibrosis to train an AI model, which suggested an optimized approach of inhibiting 2 nodal signaling pathways but with differential timing as a more effective therapeutic strategy that reduces pathologic cardiac fibrosis without negatively impacting compensatory fibrotic activity with acute MI injury. The therapeutic approach involves altering the timing of JAK-STAT signaling blockade with ruxolitinib (RUX) in combination with delayed and temporary TGF-? signaling inhibition post MI injury with pirfenidone (PFD).", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Animal studies have shown that such noise-induced tinnitus is related to increased spontaneous activity in the brainstem dorsal cochlear nucleus as well as further along the central auditory pathway. However, the role of spontaneous activity of the auditory nerve, connecting the peripheral and central auditory systems, in tinnitus and brainstem hyperactivity remains unknown. In the current study, tinnitus was induced by exposing anesthetized Mongolian gerbils to a 115-dB SPL narrowband noise. After one day of recovery, animals were behaviorally tested for gap detection deficits using a gap-prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (GPIAS) paradigm, indicative of tinnitus. Ipsilateral noise-induced threshold shifts did not differ between animals with and without signs of tinnitus. Interestingly, single auditory nerve fibers that were recorded from animals with signs of tinnitus had significantly reduced spontaneous rates compared to both noise-exposed animals without signs of tinnitus and sham-exposed animals. Furthermore, spontaneous rate reduction was specific to fibers with a best frequency within the frequency bands that showed gap detection deficits. On the other hand, inter-spike interval variability and bursting behavior increased in fibers from noise-exposed compared to sham-exposed animals but did not differ with gap detection deficits. These findings suggest that tinnitus-related central hyperactivity may be provoked by reduced spontaneous rates of its innervating auditory nerve fibers. This is consistent with current models explaining the central manifestation of tinnitus, such as the stochastic resonance and central gain models, and allows for a more detailed definition of specifically tinnitus-related deafferentation.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Although co-IP/MS does not require genetic manipulation -- thereby avoiding artifacts from exogenous protein expression and the time needed to generate stable cell or animal lines -- it is increasingly being supplanted by proximity labeling techniques due to lower sensitivity and limited robustness. These drawbacks largely arise from the non-covalent nature of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and carryover of bait and immunoglobulin (IgG) proteins in the final eluate. Here, we present a reversible crosslinker-mediated co-IP/MS workflow for endogenous proteins that (1) obviates the need for extensive lysis, wash, and elution optimization, (2) minimizes bait and IgG co-elution, and (3) captures several hundreds of interactors. We first describe subcellular-resolution, reversible crosslinker-mediated co-immunoprecipitation (SureCLIP), which enables PPI mapping of Hic-5, a focal adhesion protein, and lamin B1, a nuclear envelope protein, in cultured cells. We then introduce DrCLIP, a Danio rerio adaptation of SureCLIP, which allows comprehensive mapping of PPIs in zebrafish larvae. Using this approach, we profiled the kindlin-2 interactome in wild-type embryos without genetic manipulation. Both SureCLIP and DrCLIP exhibit high sensitivity and enable identification of novel interactors, providing a generalizable and powerful platform for defining native interactomes in 2D culture and whole animals.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

The crystal structure of the Arabidopsis member AtDUC1 reveals that DUC enzymes display a papain-like fold with a characteristic DUB-like active site, despite the apparent absence of sequence similarity to other deubiquitinase families. The K63 linkage specificity is attributed to the recognition of both distal and proximal ubiquitin units via highly conserved contact residues. Arabidopsis DUC members localize to the plasma membrane by virtue of their lipid-binding C2-like domains.

Peripheral blood samples obtained before GAD injection were restimulated with GAD in vitro to detect reactive CD4+ T cells. Re-expression of selected T cell receptors (TCRs) confirmed antigen specificity. Up to 70% of T cells at the skin injection site were clonally-expanded and 4 of 14 (28%) re-expressed TCRs were GAD-reactive. In draining LNs 1 of 14 (4%) clonally-expanded TCRs was GAD-reactive, representing ~0.08% of all T-cells. GAD-reactive cells across compartments displayed Th1 and Th17-associated transcription signatures.

However, reservoirs of latent viruses represent a major barrier to achieving a complete cure of HIV infection. To overcome the burden of viral latency, the \"Shock-and-Kill\" strategy employs latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to reactivate the virus and thus render it susceptible to elimination. Existing LRAs are not optimal and there is an unmet need for improvement. By screening a small molecule library, we identified the novel LRA candidate 2-HSB (2-hydrido-2,2'-spirobi(1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphole)) which not only reactivates latent HIV provirus but also induces specific cytopathic effects in both monocytic and T lymphocytic latent HIV reservoirs. Thus, this novel compound represents a dual \"shock and kill\" agent, unlike known LRAs which are limited to the \"shock\". The probable involvement of HIV-1 tat protein may account for its selectivity. Although both shock and kill effects seemed to be regulated by spleen tyrosine kinase, they were independent of each other, indicating that neither activation-induced cell death nor cell death-induced reactivation was occurring. Crucially, 2-HSB induced viral transcription in ART-suppressed PLWH samples in vitro. Our findings present 2-HSB as a promising dual-action compound for the \"Shock and Kill\" strategy, demonstrating efficacy in both transformed cell lines and clinically-relevant primary samples. These results raise the possibility of distinguishing the mode of action of the two effects, potentially leading to the development of a single agent causing both HIV-1 reactivation and elimination and contributing to the improvement of treatment.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in protein and RNA sequence design, progress in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) design has been constrained by the limited availability of structural data. To address this challenge, we introduce InvDNA, a deep learning-based method that designs ssDNA sequences directly from backbone atomic coordinates. This end-to-end formulation avoids the loss of structural information during backbone-to-feature conversion and further accommodates flexible backbone representations, dynamic sequence masking, and structural reconstruction objectives. All these training strategies enhance the capacity of InvDNA to generalize across diverse ssDNA structural contexts while enabling additional functionalities, including generating diversity sequences for a given backbone, reconstructing base conformations from backbone and preserving functional sites. In benchmarks using experimentally determined ssDNA structures, InvDNA achieves over a twofold improvement in sequence recovery compared with existing ssDNA design approaches. Further computational validation using AlphaFold3 shows that 44.4% of InvDNA-designed sequences successfully fold into their predefined conformations. Notably, this success rate increases when backbone coordinates are perturbed to diversify the InvDNA-designed sequences.

Although an initial inflammatory burst is essential for implantation, this response must be rapidly resolved for placentation and pregnancy to progress. The mechanisms that coordinate this temporal switch remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the transcription factor HOXA10 as a key regulator of inflammatory transitions in decidual stromal cells and examine how its dysregulation contributes to implantation failure and early pregnancy loss. In mice, HOXA10 expression decreases transiently at implantation and rises again post-implantation. Silencing HOXA10 in human decidualized stromal cells induced a robust pro-inflammatory state, altered integrin and cytoskeletal gene expression, and impaired stromal substrate adhesion. In non-pregnant Hoxa10 hypomorphs, stromal cells exhibited elevated IL1{beta} and TXNIP, activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome, and dysregulation of receptivity markers. During pregnancy, persistent HOXA10 deficiency prevented the resolution of inflammation, resulting in disorganized decidua, defective placentation, infertility, or progressive reproductive decline. To assess translational relevance, we analyzed publicly available bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets from first-trimester human decidua and from women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Single-cell analysis revealed that HOXA10 is selectively low in inflammatory decidual stromal cell clusters, which display concordant upregulation of IL1B, PYCARD, TXNIP, and inflammasome components. Consistently, both bulk and single-cell datasets from women with RPL showed reduced HOXA10 accompanied by increased inflammatory gene expression. Overall, HOXA10 functions as a temporal switch that enables the initial inflammatory activation required for implantation and subsequently suppresses inflammation to support decidual organization, adhesion, and placentation. Loss of this switch leads to persistent decidual inflammation and is associated with pregnancy loss in both mouse models and humans.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

The genetic complexity of UPS, characterized by the absence of recurrent driver oncogene mutations, has hindered the development of effective targeted therapies beyond conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy. To address this challenge, we conducted a customized in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screen in mice to systematically identify potential tumor suppressors involved in UPS development. Our screen revealed BRCA1-associated protein 1 (Bap1) as a potent tumor suppressor in STS. Using total RNA sequencing, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry, we found that Bap1-deficient mouse sarcomas exhibit significant immune suppression. Further analysis indicated that polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is essential for the survival of Bap1-deficient sarcomas. Treatment with volasertib, a Plk1 inhibitor, markedly inhibited tumor growth in both syngeneic and spontaneous mouse models of Bap1-loss sarcoma. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PLK1 inhibition, or combined with immunotherapy, may represent a promising targeted therapeutic strategy for tumors lacking BAP1.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

In this study we developed a novel microstructurally-motivated model of coronary autoregulation based on constrained mixture theory, with anatomical and structural parameters calibrated through a homeostatic optimization framework. Autoregulation was simulated at three myocardial depths (subepicardium, midwall, and subendocardium), with the calibrated model accurately reproducing baseline hemodynamics and autoregulatory responses. For changes in epicardial pressure, our model reproduced experimentally measured subendocardium-to-subepicardium flow ratios (ENDO/EPI) and changes in vessel diameter, demonstrating its predictive capability. Furthermore, we extended Womersley's theory to simulate phasic coronary hemodynamics with a time-varying intramyocardial pressure. This microstructurally-motivated framework provides a mechanistic foundation for investigating coronary autoregulation and long-term vascular growth and remodeling in pathphysiological conditions.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Spatial colocalization of presynaptic acetylcholine transporters emphasized a cholinergic basis of grey matter coupling between basal forebrain and its corticopetal projection targets amygdala, insula and cingulate cortices.

The diversity of interneurons has been recently determined based on single-cell transcriptomic analyses identifying novel populations as the Pthlh-expressing interneurons, one of the most abundant and distinctive inhibitory populations in the human and mouse striatum. Here, we generated a novel Pthlhcre knock-in mouse line that enables comprehensive study of this critical population. Quantitative histological analyses show that this line effectively targets the Pthlh interneuron class, which appears as a stable population across age, sex and the anterior-posterior axis. To elucidate their functional role, we performed selective chemogenetic inhibition of Pthlh interneurons, which caused significant impairments in striatum-dependent cognitive functions and reduced exploratory behaviorur. Importantly, selective silencing did not affect basal locomotion, motor coordination, or anxiety-like behavior. Monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed that Pthlh interneurons receive dense local input from MSN subtypes and diverse long-range afferents from thalamic and different cortical regions. We further confirm that this population displays electrophysiological heterogeneity encompassing fast-spiking and fast-spiking-like phenotypes. Overall, our findings establish Pthlh interneurons as a major inhibitory class essential for cognitive processing-but not gross motor function-acting as key integrators of local MSN feedback and thalamocortical signals.

This decline can be attributed in part to alterations within the oligodendrocyte lineage, which comprises myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) and their progenitors, NG2-glia, that play a central role in maintaining homeostasis and ensuring proper myelin turnover. While NG2-glia are distributed throughout the CNS, OLs are enriched in highly myelinated regions, implying spatially heterogeneous requirements for NG2-glia proliferation and differentiation. Consequently, age-related impairments in these progenitor functions may differentially compromise oligodendrogenesis and myelin maintenance across distinct CNS compartments. Yet, the spatial and temporal dynamics of aging-associated alterations within the oligodendrocyte lineage remains insufficiently characterized. To address this gap, we investigated the effects of aging across three age groups in two anatomically adjacent but functionally distinct CNS regions, the cortical gray matter (GM) and the corpus callosum (CC). We demonstrated that aging is accompanied by a marked decline in the NG2-glia population. Aging NG2-glia displayed cell cycle dysregulation, characterized by reduced proliferative and differentiative capacity and accompanied by increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), indicating disrupted homeostatic regulation. These alterations were most pronounced in highly myelinated regions, which also exhibited a stronger shift toward an age-associated inflammatory milieu. In parallel, we observed substantial accumulation of myelin debris and impaired phagocytic clearance in these myelin-dense areas. Moreover, we identified a selective loss of myelinating OLs in the CC, a phenomenon not detected in the gray matter (GM). Together, our findings delineate a tight interdependence between regional myelin density, inflammatory status, and the vulnerability of oligodendrocyte lineage cells to aging. These highlight multiple entry points of potential therapeutic intervention to mitigate CNS aging.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Of these, LN co-drainage only influenced Treg cell induction, establishing gut-pancreas-liver axes: Intestinal viral infection rendered hepatocyte- and exocrine pancreas-specific T cells inflammatory; liver injury promoted pancreas- and gut-directed responses.

However, maintaining high rank or social dominance can be physiologically costly, particularly in species that engage in agonistic competition to maintain their dominance status. Previous studies have rarely manipulated the intensity of agonistic competition in controlled settings to isolate the cost of social dominance. We utilized males of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni to investigate how the degree of territoriality influences patterns of oxidative stress. In this species, high-rank males compete for territories to attract mates. We housed males individually with a defendable structure and used clear tank dividers to allow visual access to a size-matched male neighbor housed in an identical setup to manipulate territoriality. Defendable structures were placed either close to the divider (proximal treatment) or further away (distal treatment). We found that males in the distal treatment expressed higher levels of territorial aggression than those in the proximal treatment. While males in the distal treatment did not display higher levels of oxidative stress, territory proximity influenced the relationships between physiological markers of dominance (i.e., testosterone, gonad size) and oxidative balance. Although our work is not consistent with higher competition increasing the physiological cost of high rank, it suggests that the level of competition influences the regulation of oxidative balance relative to social dominance characteristics. We suggest that manipulating the degree of territoriality in a controlled setting provides a unique opportunity to further our understanding of how individuals manage the trade-offs associated with high rank.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Trichomes can be relatively sparsely distributed, making their biological investigation and commercial exploitation more challenging. Here we show that infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana leaf tissue with certain nopaline-type Agrobacterium tumefacians strains induces extremely dense, localised formation of glandular trichomes 15 days post infiltration (dpi). This Agrobacterium-strain specific effect was shown to be due to the presence of a trans-zeatin synthase (tzs) gene located on some Ti plasmids, which results in the bacterial production of the cytokinin trans-zeatin. This simple procedure enables dramatically increased trichome density to be compared biologically with adjacent isogenic plant tissues on the same leaf.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

In this study, based on an RNA-sequenced gametophyte transcriptome from the apogamous fern Dryopteris affinis ssp. affinis, 1,160 proteins functionally associated with light responses, transport processes, and stress mechanisms were identified. Light responsive proteins are linked to photosynthesis, photorespiration, xanthophyll metabolism, and photomorphogenesis. Among them are several HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE (HCF 136, 173 and 244), which participate in the formation of photosystem II, and ENHANCER OF VARIEGATION 3 (EVR3), which is involved in chloroplast biogenesis. Regarding photomorphogenesis, the protein list includes the photoreceptors PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB), CRYPTOCHROMES 1 and 2 (CRY1 and 2), PHOTOTROPIN 2 (PHOT2), and UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 2, 3 and 8 (UVR2, 3 and 8).

In plants, Rho of plants (ROP) proteins function in cell polarization, hormone signalling, and plant immunity or susceptibility to diseases. The barley (Hordeum vulgare) ROP protein RACB is involved in susceptibility towards the biotrophic ascomycete fungus Blumeria hordei (Bh) and supports the accommodation of fungal haustoria. In healthy barley, RACB plays a role in cell development, a function that the pathogen may co-opt for cellular ingrowth of its haustorium into intact epidermal cells of barley. The majority of identified functions of GTP-bound activated RACB appear to be mediated by scaffold proteins. One of them, the ROP Interactive Partner b (RIPb, synonym: Interactor of Constitutive Active ROP b, ICRb) binds to RACB-GTP and co-localizes with RACB at the site of fungal host cell entry. RIPb interacts with RACB-GTP via its C-terminal coiled-coil CC2 domain (RIPbCC2) at the plasma membrane. Here, we show that a barley Calcium-Dependent Phospholipid Binding 2 (C2)-Domain Abscisic Acid-Related protein (CARa) interacts with RIPb and its RIPbCC2 domain in planta. Transient knockdown of CARa renders barley epidermal cells less susceptible to invasion by Bh, whereas overexpression supports fungal haustorium accomodation. Upon fungal attack, CARa is recruited to the site of fungal attack and localizes around the haustorial neck and at the extrahaustorial membrane. These findings further support that Bh profits from host ROP signalling components and CARa. CARa might connect RACB-RIPb-signalling to membrane organization for support of fungal infection structures in barley epidermal cells.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

In darkness, seedlings enter skotomorphogenesis, marked by hypocotyl elongation and apical hook formation, which helps seedlings emerge from the soil to reach the light. Here, we show that salinity impairs soil emergence of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings by inducing a partially photomorphogenic like phenotype in darkness, characterized by reduced apical hook curvature. Within the hook, salt stress diminished differential epidermal cell elongation required to drive hook bending, and reduced both the auxin signalling maximum and PIN3 abundance on the concave side of the hook. Transcriptome analysis revealed that salt and osmotic stresses directly alter organ-specific transcriptional profiles, including the NaCl-mediated repression of B-BOX DOMAIN PROTEIN 28 (BBX28) in hooks and cotyledons. Under control conditions, BBX28 protein accumulated asymmetrically across the hook, but this pattern was lost under salinity. Notably, the ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) exhibited an opposite gradient to BBX28, which was similarly disrupted by salt stress or by the inhibition of polar auxin transport, presenting auxin as an upstream regulator of COP1 spatial distribution. Together, these findings establish COP1 asymmetry as a novel feature of the apical hook, indicating that spatial regulation, not just absolute levels, shapes COP1 function, and reveal how salinity disrupts hormonal, transcriptional and protein networks to compromise seedling establishment under stress.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

One of the best described members of the Arabidopsis CRK family is CRK2, which was proposed as a crucial regulator of intercellular transport facilitated by plasmodesmata (PD). As intercellular channels allowing symplastic communication, PD are predominantly regulated at the neck region by callose synthase (CALS)-mediated callose deposition. This process can impact not just the distribution of molecules between adjacent cells, but also the symplastic loading of vascular tissue, thereby influencing plant stress responses and developmental processes. Here we described the overlapping expression pattern of genes encoding phylogenetically closely related CALS1 and CALS3. Both CALSs were phosphorylated in vitro by CRK2, and the genetic interaction between genes encoding CALS1 and CALS3 revealed their impact on callose deposition, rosette growth, primary root length, and development, represented as decreased number of true leaves. Importantly, we observed significant accumulation of starch in crk2 mutant plants, especially in developmentally older leaves, which was reverted by the independent introduction of cals1.5 and cals3.1 into the crk2 mutant background. We proposed that growth and developmental alterations of crk2 are caused by decreased phloem loading, which resulted in starch accumulation in source organs, and subsequent sink tissue starvation.

Using ChAT-Cre/Ai9(RCL-tdT) and ChAT-Cre/RiboTag transgenic models, we assessed both histological and transcriptomic responses after sciatic nerve lesions. Injury at P4 induced substantial motoneuron death ([~]50%), whilst P10 and P30 animals showed minimal neuronal loss. However, when correcting for neuronal survival, P4 mice demonstrated the highest regenerative capacity, with surviving neurons achieving 100% axonal regeneration. Motoneuron-specific translatome analysis revealed that P30 animals activated a robust regeneration-associated gene (RAG) programme, including classical markers such as Atf3, Gap43, and Ngfr. In contrast, P4 neurons showed minimal RAG upregulation, suggesting they retain an intrinsic growth state that facilitates regeneration without requiring transcriptional reprogramming. P10 animals exhibited a transitional phenotype with impaired RAG activation and reduced regenerative capacity. Wallerian degeneration proceeded efficiently across all developmental stages, with age-specific differences in myelin clearance kinetics and macrophage recruitment. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed consistent downregulation of myelination programmes and upregulation of pro-regenerative markers following injury, regardless of age.

In this work, we propose a modeling framework to investigate the transient persistence of fluvial metapopulations, i.e., the temporary occupation of riverscape patches by a metapopulation that is expected to go extinct in the long run. The theoretical foundation of our approach is rooted in the concept of ecological reactivity, which provides an effective complement to asymptotic stability analysis for studying the short-term response of ecological systems to impulsive perturbations to otherwise stable equilibria. Our results indicate that, under ecohydrological conditions conducive to a reactive metapopulation extinction equilibrium, even a metapopulation that is asymptotically bound to extinction can colonize parts of the riverscape for non-negligible periods of time. We find that the temporal scales associated with these transient phenomena, in the presence of repeated positive perturbations of the extinction equilibirum, may allow for reactive pseudo-persistence, i.e., an arbitrarily long delay in the eventual extinction of the metapopulation that may occur well below the deterministic extinction threshold. By identifying the ecohydrological drivers of reactivity-driven metapopulation persistence, as well as the riverscape patches that contribute the most to transient metapopulation dynamics over different temporal scales, our analysis may provide valuable suggestions for spatial prioritization of conservation and restoration efforts.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

We detected 73 species of Metazoa and Plantae and classified them by their status (native, cryptogenic and NIS).

We tested whether larvae follow optimal turning strategies when reorienting toward a vibrating artificial stimulus placed in disadvantageous positions along the pit. Most larvae responded and often ended in an optimal sand-throwing position. Initial orientation strongly predicted turning direction: larvae rotated along the shortest angular path to reach the optimal sand-throwing orientation. Our results show that antlion larvae do not rely on rigid reflexes during prey capture but appear to integrate vibrational cues with spatial rules to minimize angular displacement. This reveals unexpected behavioural flexibility in a sit-and-wait predator with highly limited mobility.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Traditional embryo evaluation relies predominantly on morphology, lacking quantitative mechanical parameters that could enhance selection accuracy. Recent studies indicate that the stiffness (elasticity) of the zona pellucida (ZP) the glycoprotein-rich extracellular matrix surrounding mammalian oocytes and embryos correlates with embryo quality and developmental potential. However, current biomechanical characterization techniques, including micropipette aspiration, atomic force microscopy (AFM), microtactile sensors, and MEMS-based systems , either pose risks of mechanical damage or involve complex, time-consuming procedures unsuitable for clinical settings. Here, we introduce a novel approach leveraging fluidic force microscopy cantilevers to non-invasively evaluate embryo biomechanics. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates rapid, precise stiffness profiling of intact mouse embryos (specifically ZP elasticity) in under one minute per embryo. Using gentle microsuction attachment with no chemical adhesives or rigid immobilization, the method preserves embryo integrity while providing reproducible elasticity measurements. This method combines the precision of AFM with minimal invasiveness, offering a promising new quantitative biomechanical indicator to augment clinical embryo assessment and paving the way for broader applications in reproductive biology.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

In vitro cultures are the only available method to temporally perturb and study living human brain cells throughout neurogenesis, however most culture systems use supraphysiologic conditions of essential nutrients, glucose and oxygen. We probed how environmental exposure to endogenous-like concentrations impact metabolic state and developmental progression of cortical cell types using organoids. Nutrient accessibility globally impacted metabolic state, yet developmental responses to metabolic changes were cell type-specific. Metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets reveal increased TCA metabolites and amino acids and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, under physiologic glucose conditions. Oxygen level had a modest, yet specific, molecular impact on deep layer excitatory neurons. We assessed consequences of metabolic changes on fate and observed that physiologic glucose expanded the human-enriched population of cortical stem cells, outer radial glia, and their progeny, upper layer excitatory neurons. Alterations in oxygen, instead, affected production of neurogenic progenitors and neuronal differentiation, with higher oxygen availability supporting shifts toward mitochondrial metabolism necessary for maturing cell types. We functionally tested this transition by inhibiting glycolysis; total inhibition promoted neuronal differentiation, whereas inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis/lactate production led to oRG expansion. Lactate signaling was sufficient to suppress oRG development and promote self-renewal of neurogenic progenitors. These data suggest that refined metabolic switches and decreased reliance on glucose are required for transition from stem cell self-renewal to more mature, diversified progenitor subtypes, where switch from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism discretely impacts progenitor diversification.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Objective: To evaluate the analgesic activity of NLX-204 in two rat models of nociceptive/inflammatory pain: the monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and the Brennan's plantar incision model, using morphine as an active comparator, in both male and female rats. Methods: KOA was induced by left intra-articular MIA injection. Analgesic effects of NLX-204 (0.1-3 mg/kg p.o.) or morphine (6 mg/kg s.c.) were assessed on days 5 and 8 by measuring withdrawal threshold (WT) using von Frey filaments and dynamic weight bearing (DWB) on injured and contralateral limbs. In the Brennan's model, the plantar surface of the left hind limb was incised with elevation and incision of the plantaris muscle. Mechanical allodynia (WT) and guarding behavior (GB) were assessed 24 h post-surgery. Results: In the MIA-KOA model, NLX-204 significantly attenuated DWB imbalance in males at 1-3 mg/kg (acute) and 0.1-3 mg/kg (repeated dosing), and in females at 3 mg/kg (repeated dosing only). NLX-204 demonstrated anti-allodynic activity (VF filaments) from 0.3 mg/kg in males (acute and repeated) and from 1 mg/kg in females. In the Brennan's model, NLX-204 reduced GB scores at 1 mg/kg (males) and 0.3-1 mg/kg (females), and showed anti-allodynic effects from 0.3 mg/kg in both sexes. Morphine was effective in both models under acute and repeated administration.

Aberrant insula function is also implicated in attentional impairments in several psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia. Although the insulas role in attention has been well-studied in humans, we do not yet have an understanding of how the insula communicates with other brain areas to promote attentional processing. Here, we show that neurons in the mouse insula send direct axonal projections to the frontal cortex, and that these two brain areas functionally interact in different ways between male and female mice performing a touchscreen-based attention task. Specifically, we recorded and analyzed local field potentials (LFPs) from the insula and frontal cortex while mice performed variants of a rodent analogue of the continuous performance test of attention, or rCPT. In male mice, we found that activity in the frontal cortex preceded insular activity when the task was well-learned, but that insula-frontal cortex synchrony decreased when the need to inhibit responding was high. In female mice, synchrony between the insula and frontal cortex was largely bidirectional, but was high during all session types. We further demonstrate that patterns of theta-gamma coupling between the frontal cortex and insula distinguish between correct choices and errors during the rCPT, and that these patterns diverge between sexes.

J.; Titov, V. V.; Lochner, S.; Straw, A. D.", "abstract": "Honey bees routinely fly hundreds or thousands of meters between their hive and established foraging locations. To navigate these long distances, they are known to combine both landmark use and path integration and have been hypothesized to build a cognitive map. Due to technical challenges inherent in tracking these small insects, obtaining three-dimensional, high-resolution measurements of individual navigational precision, and thus a detailed understanding of their strategies, has been difficult. Here, we utilize a novel multicopter drone-based tracking system to measure the individual flight paths of honey bees in a structured agricultural landscape at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Although bees could choose from multiple routes, we discovered that individual bees follow idiosyncratic paths with striking and repeatable precision. Flight path variability was highest over visually sparse regions and lowest near prominent proximal landmarks. Furthermore, individual strategies differed: some bees flew directly toward the hive before maneuvering around a specific tree, while others flew directly to a gap between a hedgerow and the tree. Thus, each animal varies in how it uses visual information and selects between behavioral strategies. The level of precision exhibited by their flight paths exceeds that reported in the waggle dance, implying that dance variability does not reflect a limit in the bee's underlying spatial representation. Our results demonstrate the remarkable precision of individual bee navigation and illustrate the potential of this new drone-based tracking method to illuminate fine-scale behavioral mechanisms across a spectrum of honey bee ecology and cognition.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Location Great Britain. Time period Present (1981-2020) Major taxa studied Terrestrial invertebrates (n=1,722 species). Methods We determined the habitat associations for each of 1,722 species from 14 taxonomic groups in each of 18 land cover types in Great Britain. We used these values to calculate a human association index (based on whether species occupy human-modified land cover types, such as urban, suburban and coniferous plantation habitats, or occur in relatively unmodified land covers, such as several coastal habitats and marshlands) and habitat specialisation index (whether they are restricted to a few land cover types, or widely distributed across different land cover types) for each species. We then investigated the relationship between human association and habitat specialisation, as well as the relationship between human association and two metrics of range change between 1981-2000 and 2001-2020. Results Contrary to previous hypotheses, we find no evidence that species associated with human-modified environments are more likely to be habitat generalists. Furthermore, human-associated species were more likely to increase. On average, the geographic distributions of the most human-associated third of species increased by 58% over the study period, whereas the least human associated third of species declined by 7.1%. Main conclusions Humans have had increasingly large impacts on the world's ecosystems, generating an intensity gradient of human-modification, including novel (anthropogenic) environments. Our findings show that new environments have provided opportunities for species to colonise, generating faunas which include species that have become human-associated specialists.

Transcriptomic profiling of vastus lateralis biopsies enables profiling of COPD-cachexia relevant dysregulation. As obtaining muscle biopsies is invasive and yields limited tissue, human muscle derived cultures (HMDC) may enable mechanistic research into cachexia. However, questions remain regarding the extent to which HMDC recapitulate transcriptomic signatures of bulk skeletal muscle in COPD-cachexia. To address this gap, we tested whether COPD and COPD-cachexia associated transcriptional dysregulation signatures in bulk skeletal muscle are preserved in derived myoblasts, myocytes, and myotubes. Methods: Vastus lateralis biopsies were collected from 13 (6M/7F, 64+/-9 years) participants; COPD n=5, COPD-cachexia n=4, and 4 age-matched controls. Cachexia was defined using a composite measure of weight loss coupled with reduced muscle strength, fatigue, anorexia, low muscle mass and/or systemic inflammation. Satellite cells were isolated and differentiated into myoblasts, myocytes, and myotubes. Differential gene expression testing, generated from RNA-sequencing, identified transcripts significantly dysregulated (p>0.05) in bulk tissue. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify modules of co-expressed genes at the whole-transcriptome and mitochondrial transcriptome levels. Bulk tissue modules were tested for preservation in HMDC (Z-summary >2) and correlated with clinical traits. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed for all modules. Results: 1,379 genes were significantly differentially expressed in bulk samples from all COPD participants compared to controls. The top upregulated gene was IL32 (L2FC=4.5, p=1.3x10-3) and top downregulated CGN (L2FC=-5.8, p=8.8x10-3). A total of 632 genes were significantly differentially expressed in bulk samples from COPD participants with and without cachexia. The top upregulated gene was SEMA4F (L2FC=5.0, p=6.9x10-4) and top downregulated ARC (L2FC=-4.9, p=3.1x10-2). WGCNA generated 9 modules (Modules 1-9) at the whole-transcriptome level and 2 modules (Modules A and B) at the mitochondrial transcriptome level. Modules 1, 4, 5, and 9 were significantly correlated with COPD-cachexia. Of these, module 1 was preserved in myoblasts and modules 4, 5 and 9 in myocytes. These modules are enriched with genes involved in metabolic and inflammatory remodeling, catabolic stress and atrophy, and chromatin-driven regeneration. Conclusions: These results provide a foundation for using myocytes and myoblasts as in vitro models of degeneration and repair pathway dysregulation in COPD-cachexia. Several modules were preserved between bulk skeletal muscle and HMDC, suggesting HMDC have utility for studying COPD-cachexia.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Using intracranial EEG recordings from epilepsy patients performing a sustained attention to response task (SART), we first identified attentional states based on behavioral variability and subjective reports. Next, we observed that SWRs were more frequent during high-attention periods, despite the absence of memory demands. Importantly, SWRs during low-attention periods showed higher phase synchrony with low-frequency oscillations (theta to lower beta) indicating increased endogenous coordination of SWRs under low attentional focus. These findings show that SWRs are dynamically regulated by attentional engagement, supporting a broader role for ripples in active cognitive processing.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

We recently discovered that the pattern recognition receptor Dectin-1 (Clec7a) controls expression of a network of killer lectin-like receptors (KLRs), including KLRI1 and KLRI2, which regulate adaptive immune responses. Here, we identify KLRE1 as a key regulator of DC phenotype and function, acting through distinct heterodimeric interactions with KLRI1 and KLRI2. KLRE1 is expressed by tissue-resident and bone marrow-derived DCs and is dynamically regulated by inflammatory signals, including fungal stimuli. Mechanistically, KLRE1:KLRI1 heterodimers promote DC activation, increasing CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC-II, whereas KLRE1:KLRI2 heterodimers restrain activation. Differential regulation of KLRI1 and KLRI2 by inflammatory signals shapes heterodimer availability and immune outcomes under distinct conditions. Functionally, KLRE1 deficiency enhances DC activation and T cell responses in vitro and in vivo during Candida albicans infection. Strikingly, KLRI1- and KLRI2-deficient mice showed opposite survival outcomes during systemic candidiasis, despite similar fungal burdens, implicating KLRE1 heterodimers in disease tolerance rather than pathogen clearance. Protection in KLRI1-deficient mice was associated with a more balanced T cell response, whereas susceptibility to infection associated with KLRI2 deficiency resulted from increased T cell activation and migratory potential, leading to systemic inflammation and renal dysfunction. Thus, KLRE1 heterodimers fine-tune DC-driven T cell immunity, balancing protection and immunopathology during fungal infection.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

The Vibrio cholerae cytotoxin MakA, a member of the ClyA structural family of -PFTs, exhibits a unique, pH-dependent ability to induce lipid membrane tubulation. This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. We identify the N-terminal histidine residue (His30) of MakA as a critical pH sensor that is indispensable for membrane tubulation but not required for membrane binding and cell lysis. Substitution of His30 with lysine, MakAH30K , abrogated tubulation without affecting membrane insertion, instead triggering aberrant membrane fusion events. Circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis revealed that the MakAH30K substitution attenuates the robust -helical transition observed in wild-type MakA upon lipid membrane binding, providing a molecular explanation for its functional defect. Furthermore, we established that membrane cholesterol contributes to MakA-induced tubulation of lipid membranes, as its absence or mutation of a putative cholesterol-binding motif MakAI236D&I237D abolishes both membrane association and tubule formation. A key implication of our work is the mechanistic uncoupling of membrane tubulation from cytolysis, revealing that MakA can perturb membranes via distinct pathways. These findings define a sophisticated activation mechanism where His30 protonation in the acidic host environment and specific cholesterol binding synergistically drive the conformational change necessary for helical oligomerization and membrane tubulation. We discuss our findings from the viewpoint of possible convergent evolution, where bacterial PFTs like MakA partly may mimic ancient membrane remodelers involved in membrane repair pathways, such as ESCRT-III, but for bacterial fitness in host interactions and pathogenesis.

Using paired whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-seq before and after drought stress in wheat landraces, we probed the nuanced role of DNA methylation in the drought response, uncovering antagonistic trends between cytosine contexts and novel mechanisms, with the ROS1a family potentially playing a key demethylation role under drought. Examination of gene methylation profiles revealed that gene body methylation was strongly positively correlated with gene expression but negatively with stress responsiveness, simultaneously identifying that gene body differentially methylated regions (DMRs) targeted stress-associated genes. Many DMR-associated genes maintained consistent transcription under stress, suggesting a stabilising role for DNA methylation. Most DMRs localised to intergenic regions and transposable elements (TEs), with the ancient LTR retrotransposon RLX_famc9 emerging as a critical target of differential methylation under drought. We propose a model in which the RLX_famc9 family, enriched in differential methylation and exhibiting substantial sequence similarity to drought-responsive genes, is involved in the trans-regulation of stress-associated genes under control conditions through the generation of regulatory siRNA precursors, a mechanism suppressed by drought-inducible hypermethylation.

This includes the removal of numerous group II-type introns, most of which reside within genes encoding subunits of respiratory complex I (CI). The maturation of mitochondrial transcripts (mt-RNAs) requires the coordinated action of numerous nuclear-encoded RNA-binding cofactors, such as maturases, RNA helicases, and members of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family. In this study, we characterize PPR9 (At1g03560), a mitochondrial P-type PPR protein identified in genetic screens for essential protein cofactors. Loss of PPR9 function disrupts embryogenesis, resulting in early arrest of seed development. Nevertheless, homozygous mutant plants can be maintained using an embryo-rescue approach optimized in our laboratory. Homozygous ppr9 mutants exhibit delayed germination, retarded growth, and impaired mitochondrial respiration. Molecular analyses further reveal that, unlike canonical PPR factors that act on a single or a few closely related transcripts, PPR9 is essential for the splicing of several mitochondrial introns, including nad2 intron 3 and nad7 introns 1 and 2. These defects lead to impaired biogenesis of the respiratory CI enzyme and disrupted OXPHOS activities in the mutants.

Machine learning offers a promising way to model phenotype from genotype, but requires sizable datasets that quantitatively link phenotype to specific genes. Such datasets remain limited; however, maize pollen provides a unique biological system that is especially well suited for this challenge. Because maize pollen is haploid, mutations that affect its function can result in a quantitative phenotypic effect on pollen fitness, measurable as deviations in transmission rate from the expected Mendelian ratio. We leveraged a large set of fluorescently-marked insertional mutations, the Ds-GFP lines, to link fitness effects to specific genes. We then developed a machine learning framework that integrates expression profiling and genomic data to predict genes contributing to pollen fitness in maize. Well performing models that distinguish genes with strong fitness effects from those with little or no fitness effect could be generated using features, such as codon usage, derived solely from genome sequence (auROC 85%). Using expression data enabled even more successful models, achieving auROC values above 90%. Because we used interpretable machine learning methods, we were able to identify expression specificity as a critical feature for strongest model performance. The best performing model was achieved when specificity measures were complemented with certain genomic sequence features. Models that include expression specificity meet expectations of mutational frequencies across the genome in a well characterized mutagenized population.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Like external attention, internal selection can be shaped by both endogenous (goal-driven) and exogenous (stimulus-driven) factors. Classic work by Charles Folk and Roger Remington demonstrated that such factors interact competitively during external attention, producing stimulus-driven capture under certain conditions. Whether similar competitive dynamics govern internal selection remains unclear. Here, we combined EEG and eye-tracking to examine how endogenous and exogenous influences interact during the selection of information held in working memory. Participants remembered two oriented bars and used either a pro-cue or an anti-cue to guide recall. Behavioral responses and lateralized alpha-band activity revealed robust delays in selecting task-relevant WM content under competition. In contrast, oculomotor biases toward memorized locations emerged with similar timing across pro- and anti-cue conditions, providing no evidence for retro-capture or delayed selection. These findings indicate that internal selection does not resolve competition via rapid capture, as in external attention, but through time-extended cortical processes. Our results highlight functional dissociations between cortical and oculomotor systems and offer new insight into how internal attention implements selection under competitive demands.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Northern epilepsy belongs to a group of genetically diverse lysosomal storage diseases, the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). A characteristic feature of NCL pathology is the accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin in the central nervous system. Northern epilepsy is a late-infantile -onset disease. Patients develop normally until 5-10 years old when they first present with general tonic-clonic seizures, followed by progressive cognitive impairment and a decline in motor skills. Northern epilepsy is caused by a missense variant in CLN8, causing a p.R24G amino acid substitution. CLN8 deficiency has been studied traditionally using motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mice, which carry a spontaneous frame shift variant in the murine orthologue Cln8, which is not known to exist in humans. Methods. We have generated the first Cln8 p.R24G mouse model (Cln8R24G) using CRISPR/Cas9. Phenotyping analysis of the mice was conducted using behavioral and histopathological studies focusing on the brain and retina. Results. At birth, Cln8R24G KI mice were viable and asymptomatic. As the mice aged, a progressive accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin containing the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit C was evident in different brain regions and retinal layers. Health monitoring revealed that mutant mice developed progressive but mild motor symptoms around 7 months of age. Spontaneous epileptic seizures, like those observed in Northern epilepsy patients, were detected and recorded. An increase in FosB staining intensity, reflecting neuronal hyperactivity, was observed in hippocampal CA1-CA3 pyramidal and dentate granule cells and correlated well with the intensity of seizure activity. Neuroinflammation was evident at 4 months and increased dramatically with age, mainly in the thalamic VPN/VPL nuclei and moderately in the cortex. Neurodegeneration was most prominent in the VPN/VPL thalamic nuclei. Conclusions. We have generated the Cln8R24G mouse model that genocopies, for the first time, the pathogenic CLN8 variant present in patients with Northern epilepsy. These mice phenocopy major clinical features of the human disease, including mild motor impairment and, unlike the mnd mice, spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures. We hypothesize that our mouse model will open new possibilities for developing and testing targeted treatment options for Northern epilepsy and, more broadly, for early-onset neurodegenerative disorders associated with epilepsy.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

This type of cell conversion is facilitated by introducing lineage-specific transcription factors or small molecules to somatic cells, and can even be achieve in vivo, targeting resident glia cells in the brain for in vivo conversion. While this have shown promising results in animal models, a crucial step is to show the long-term survival and maturation of human reprogrammed cells in vivo. However, this remains largely unexplored partly due to the inaccessible cell source of GPC and difficulty in transplanting converted neurons. In this study, we assessed human GPCs derived iNs for their long-term structural and functional neuronal maturation after transplantation to the immunodeficient mouse brain. GPCs were transduced with established transcription factor cocktail and transplanted to the medial prefrontal cortex as three-dimensional cultures to improve survival and integration upon transplantation. Our results reveal survival of hiNs, for up to 10 months post-transplantation (MPT) and wide distribution across local and proximal functionally connected brain regions. Morphological analysis revealed a gradual neuronal maturation over time, characterized by increase in cellular complexity and expression of neuronal markers. Supporting these findings, electrophysiological recordings demonstrated progressive functional maturation up to 5 MPT with increase in sodium and potassium currents, and the ability to generate multiple evoked and spontaneous action potentials, validating a neuronal phenotype. Importantly, these changes were absent in control grafts of non-converted hGPCs that retained their glia identity. Our findings indicate that hGPCs derived iNs maintain a stable neuronal phenotype that persist in the mouse brain for extended periods. These cells exhibit survival and remarkable adaptability to the host environment, enabling both structural and functional maturation over time. These results highlight their potential as a promising strategy for neural replacement therapies aimed at restoring damaged circuits and promoting brain repair.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

We hypothesize that a key signature of this balance is the presence of memory effects, which arise when a brain region's future activity depends not only on its current state, but also on past information fed back from the wider network. Here we introduce the FDTest, a method for assessing local memory effects in multidimensional systems by measuring violations of a generalized Fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). We first apply this framework to whole-brain models fitted to human neuroimaging data, showing that the brain's memory structure reflects its underlying connectivity. We then extend the analysis to individualized models of subjects during wakefulness and deep sleep. Memory effects are consistently stronger in wakefulness, indicating richer inter-regional dependencies and more integrated dynamics. These findings establish local memory as a dynamical marker of brain state and position the FDTest as a principled tool for probing the hidden structure of neural dynamics in both models and experiments.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

The roles of arterial baroreceptors in systemic physiology are well appreciated, but the functions of vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors have been more difficult to parse, in part due to the closed-loop structure of the cardiovascular system. Here, we use genetic tools for isolated study of vagal mechanoreceptors in the heart, finding that they are acutely sensitive to circulating blood volume and play key roles in compensating for decreased filling of the heart that occurs in an upright posture and during hemorrhage. Vagal PIEZO2 neurons form characteristic end-net endings in the heart and display blood volume-dependent responses with every heartbeat that are time-locked to atrial and ventricular systole. Vagal PIEZO2 knockout eliminates heartbeat-coupled nerve activity, and compromises carotid blood pressure when mice on a tilt-table are rotated to an upright position. Vagal PIEZO2 knockout mice also display a lethal failure to sustain blood pressure during trauma-induced blood loss.

Here, we ask: are computations over linguistic input driven in a bottom-up way, by the input, or in a top-down way, by task demands? Participants (n=52) read sentences and nonword lists under six task conditions, including passive reading, reading with a memory probe at the end, and tasks that require deep semantic engagement. The sentences>nonwords contrast isolated the same set of language-responsive voxels across all tasks; the locations of those voxels were participant-specific, highlighting the value of individual-specific functional localization. We therefore conclude that language localization is robust to task variation. We then examined responses to each task in these language-responsive voxels (the language network) and in the domain-general multiple demand (MD) network, known to respond to task demands. The language network responded robustly to sentences across all tasks, with somewhat higher responses to semantically engaging tasks. In contrast, the MD network responded to both sentences and nonwords in the presence of a demanding task, which warrants caution when examining brain responses to language tasks accompanied by task demands, as such tasks engage two independent systems. A multivariate analysis revealed that stimulus information is more easily decodable in the language network, whereas task information is more decodable in the MD network. These results suggest that the language and MD networks perform complementary functions during task-driven language comprehension, with the language network primarily extracting information from linguistic input and the MD network determining the appropriate response to the task.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

This enhanced protection concurs with increased alveolar macrophages (AMs) resulting from a self-renewal process in the lungs. Importantly, these AMs are programmed to acquire neutrophil-released antimicrobial enzymes from the extracellular space to kill MRSA, prevent tissue damage, and rapidly restore lung homeostasis. The gain of AM functions is dependent on differential gene expression, including expression of the efferocytosis receptor MerTK and the anti-apoptotic regulator Bcl-xL.

When viral nucleic acids engage endosomal and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRR), antiviral immune responses are supported by mitochondrial remodeling but the role of mitochondria in fine tuning ligand-specific responses remains incompletely understood. For example, endosomal TLR3 can detect various lengths of dsRNA (0.4-8 kb) ranging from viral segmented genomes or endogenous nucleic acids have been shown to induce distinct cytokine profiles. However, it is unclear if these differences are associated with differential mitochondrial remodeling. Here, we report that TLR3 engagement with both high (HMW; 1.5-8 kb) or low molecular weight (LMW; 0.2-1 kb) Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) is associated with reduced but sustained oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production/accumulation to support antiviral responses in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). They differed in the amount of mtROS production, their spare respiratory capacity (SRC) and their mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Interestingly, while uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was found required for antiviral cytokine production, it did not contribute to ligand specific responses. Dynamic modulation of complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC), however resulted in the differential accumulation of mtROS (HMW>LMW). Further, selectively targeting the mtROS derived from Complex I leads to augmented type I IFN production. Overall, these findings highlight that targeting specific sources of mtROS without affecting electron flow may be a potential avenue for specific augmentation of antiviral responses during viral infections.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Neutrophil swarming represents a prominent example of such self-organisation. During this process, neutrophils engage in coordinated autocrine/paracrine chemoattractant signalling that drives rapid clustering at sites of injury or infection. Whether neutrophil swarming can be regeared to influence immune outcomes is unclear. Here, we show that neutrophil swarming is subject to reprogramming after microbial experience and amenable to targeted genetic engineering with measurable effects on infection outcome. We established a model of bacterial wound infection in zebrafish, focusing on P. aeruginosa, an important opportunistic pathogen. We demonstrate that zebrafish larvae exposed to prior microbial experience (with non-pathogenic E. coli) are more resistant to subsequent wound infection by P. aeruginosa, in comparison to naive animals. Through live imaging and chemical perturbations, we show that these training effects are in part attributed to changes in neutrophil swarming and associated gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic enhancement of 5-lipoxygenase in neutrophils is sufficient to maximise neutrophil swarming and improve infection outcome. Together, these data suggest new routes for reprogramming neutrophil accumulation in tissues, via manipulating their ability to shape chemoattractant landscapes.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Following acute starvation on a low sugar diet, dPIP4K29 larvae show reduced survival and accelerated pupariation. This phenotype of dPIP4K29 larvae was associated with high circulating trehalose levels, while under equivalent conditions, wildtype larvae undergo depletion of circulating trehalose. The change in circulating trehalose levels during starvation has been reported to depend on the trehalose transporter Tret1-1PA in brain glial cells. We found that while Tret1-1PA transcripts were upregulated on starvation in wild type flies, there was no such enhancement in dPIP4K29. A glia specific depletion of Tret1-1PA in wild type larvae prevents reduction of circulating trehalose levels upon starvation, phenocopying that seen in dPIP4K29.

Similar problems arise when richness or sample size varies. We develop an approach that mitigates these issues using Hubbell's neutral theory, a model in which species abundances change through stochastic births and deaths in a community with a fixed number of individuals J. Change in community composition is faster for smaller J, so 1/J provides a process-based rate metric that can be estimated from empirical time-series. We derive the likelihood for changes in community composition under neutral theory. Our approach accurately estimates rates in simulated data even when time-scale, richness, and sample size vary. We use Quaternary pollen cores to demonstrate the power of this method for comparing rates between sites and across time and testing for rate shifts.

Because stable social groups facilitate the circulation of persistent neurotropic viruses, we asked whether long-term viral exposure may have contributed to shifts in brain-body scaling. Using published records of endogenous bornavirus-like elements (EBLs, genomic remnants of ancient neurotropic RNA viruses), we show that mammalian clades with steeper encephalization slopes tend to exhibit higher EBL burdens, whereas highly social lineages without pronounced brain expansion show minimal evidence of past bornaviral integration. These patterns suggest that viral exposure may modulate the association between sociality and encephalization. To explore potential mechanisms, we modeled the evolutionary dynamics of ARHGAP11B, a hominin-specific gene that promotes basal progenitor amplification. Under weak cognitive selection alone, fixation of such an allele is slow and unlikely; however, under episodic, bornavirus-like developmental stress, fixation becomes substantially more probable when the allele is present as standing variation. This suggests that persistent neurotropic viral pressure could accelerate selection on neurogenic pathways.

A.; Dearman, J. J.; Maqbool, H.; Pujol, M.; Moron, J.

Here, we tested whether long-term, non-social, object-based EE alters fentanyl self-administration, extinction, and stress-induced reinstatement in male and female rats. Rats were individually housed in either standard non-enriched (NE) conditions or in EE cages containing a rotating set of novel objects beginning at least three days prior to self-administration. EE did not impact acquisition of fentanyl self-administration but reduced fentanyl intake during maintenance of self-administration and reduces the persistence of drug-seeking in extinction. Following extinction, yohimbine robustly reinstated drug-seeking behavior in NE rats but reinstatement in EE rats was markedly attenuated, indicating reduced sensitivity to stress-induced relapse triggers. Circulating corticosterone levels were lower in EE rats across the experiment and were positively correlated with reinstatement responding, suggesting that enrichment effects may be mediated in part by reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation. These findings demonstrate that object-based EE, even in the absence of social enrichment, is sufficient to blunt fentanyl use, facilitate extinction, and constrain stress-induced reinstatement. The results highlight the role of environmental context and stress regulation in fentanyl vulnerability and suggest that enrichment-inspired, non-social interventions may offer a scalable strategy to reduce opioid use and relapse risk.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Liquid biopsies offer a promising noninvasive alternative; however, their limited detection sensitivity and lack of information on the source of biomarkers pose great challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using focused ultrasound (FUS) with microbubbles to enrich circulating DMG tumor biomarkers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a mouse model. Methods Murine DMG cells, transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase (Fluc) genes, were orthotopically injected into the mouse brain. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to guide FUS targeting of the DMG tumor. Droplet digital PCR assays were developed to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and RNA (ctRNA) of EGFP and Fluc in blood and CSF samples collected after FUS. Results FUS enhanced the plasma levels of EGFP ctRNA by 5.4-fold (p=0.0112), compared with liquid biopsy without FUS. CSF EGFP ctDNA was increased by 2.5-fold (p=0.0253), and Fluc ctDNA was increased by 2.6-fold (p=0.0253) with FUS. No brain tissue damage was associated with FUS sonication. Conclusions This study demonstrated the feasibility and safety of FUS in enriching tumor biomarkers in blood and CSF in a mouse model of DMG. The enrichment ratio for circulating biomarkers depends on the source (plasma vs. CSF), analyte type (ctDNA vs. ctRNA), and individual marker (EGFP vs. Fluc). These findings support the potential future application of FUS to advance the diagnosis of DMG through liquid biopsy.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

VUS lead to incomplete diagnosis for patients, potentially causing anxiety due to the uncertainty associated with VUS and resulting in suboptimal management. Results: We developed a software, VUSVista, for organised and semi-automated VUS curation. It offers American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria management, external database references, standardised Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms for sample phenotypes, links between variants and pseudonymised samples as well as audit trails. VUSVista automatically checks for updates to ClinVar's germline classification entries of recorded VUS and searches for newly released publications referencing its VUS using LitVar 2.0. Users are notified whenever a ClinVar entry is updated or a relevant publication is found, helping them stay informed about new scientific discoveries. Assessing the significance of this new evidence may lead to VUS reclassification through VUSVista. One-to-one sessions and a focus group were conducted with medical laboratory scientists and a senior pharmacist to validate the system.

While the mechanisms underlying poststroke recovery remain incompletely understood, sleep fragmentation, a common consequence of stroke, has been linked to worse patient outcomes. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that promotes sleep by suppressing wakefulness and enhancing sleep continuity. We hypothesized that lemborexant would reduce poststroke sleep disturbances and promote recovery in a rodent model of stroke. Methods: We examined the effects of lemborexant (10mg/kg and 30mg/kg) and zolpidem (30 mg/kg) on sleep macrostructure, fragmentation, and EEG spectra in both healthy mice and in stroke model mice, which underwent photothrombotic ischemia of the forelimb somatosensory cortex. We also evaluated whether 12 days of drug administration altered infarct volume and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice. Results: Lemborexant treatment (30mg/kg) increased the percentage of NREM sleep, while preserving sleep continuity, in both healthy and stroke model mice. In contrast, zolpidem increased NREM sleep after stroke, but also increased sleep fragmentation in both groups. Lemborexant treatment at 10mg/kg and 30mg/kg significantly reduced infarct volume eight weeks after the induction of stroke. In addition, lemborexant-treated mice showed greater use of the impaired limb four weeks after stroke. Interpretation: These preclinical findings suggest that lemborexant stabilizes sleep and promotes structural and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice, supporting its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention following ischemic stroke.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

One of the most prevalent mutations is the Arg245His variant, representing up to 58% of mutations in some populations. Whilst other mouse models exist, their applicability to, and translational delivery of, clinically relevant pharmacological chaperones is limited. We therefore aimed to generate and characterise a novel SgshR245H knock-in mouse model of MPS IIIA. Methods: CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing introduced the SgshR245H mutation, and a breeding colony was established. Mouse behaviour was evaluated in a test battery; SGSH activity and heparan sulfate levels were measured using fluorometric and mass spectrometric assays, respectively; and histological staining was undertaken to characterise brain pathology. Results: Spatial memory and learning deficits were apparent in the Morris Water Maze probe and Y-maze tests. Elevated Plus Maze exploration revealed reduced anxiety-like behaviours. SgshR245H mice exhibited progressive accumulation of brain heparan sulfate and elevated levels of GFAP-reactive astroglial staining and activated microglia.

Despite current antiviral therapies effectively suppressing viral replication, functional cure rates are low due to HBV-induced immune dysfunction and exhaustion. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches to achieve immune control of HBV infection are needed. Following the systematic evaluation of multiple HBV mRNA antigen designs, we developed mRNA-1965, a trivalent therapeutic mRNA vaccine encoding nanoparticle-displayed PreS1 and PreS2 domains of HBsAg to bypass the immune interference caused by HBV subviral particles, along with mutant forms of HBV Core and Polymerase. In HBV naive mice, mRNA-1965 immunization induced dose-dependent HBV-neutralizing antibodies and Th1-skewed CD4+ and IFN{gamma}+ CD8+ T cell responses to all three encoded HBV antigens. In non-human primates, mRNA-1965 elicited broad antibody and T cell responses across multiple HBV genotypes. Furthermore, vaccination with mRNA-1965 achieved a strong neutralizing antibody response and complete clearance of serum and liver HBV biomarkers in in an AAV-HBV mouse model with ~100 IU/mL baseline HBsAg. Notably, combining mRNA-1965 with immune stimulatory co-modalities targeting PD-L1 and OX40 further enhanced therapeutic efficacy in mice with ~1000 IU/mL baseline HBsAg. Clearance of HBV in AAV-HBV mice was associated with T cell response to mRNA-encoded antigens and with activation and differentiation of Core-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings support the potential of mRNA-1965 to promote a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B by overcoming immune dysfunction and subsequently enabling robust, functional immunity.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Using mouse models of airborne exposure to house dust mites and Alternaria, we found that allergen sensitization generates lymphoid- and lung-resident MBCs. Upon allergen re-exposure, these populations followed distinct differentiation trajectories: lymph node MBCs engaged a germinal center (GC)-dependent pathway that generated both IgG1 and IgE plasma cells (PCs), whereas lung MBCs followed a GC-independent route producing mainly IgG1 PCs. GC re-entry granted MBCs access to an IL-4-rich microniche formed by Tfh cells, which was essential for IgE production. Disrupting GC re-entry, IL-4 signaling, or Tfh-derived IL-4 during recall markedly reduced allergen-specific IgE titers. These findings reveal a spatially and cytokine-restricted mechanism that confines IgE memory to lymphoid organs, positioning GC IL-4 microniches as anatomical safeguards against IgE production at barrier sites frequently exposed to environmental antigens.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Some members of the Orthoflavivirus genus activate mitophagy to allow extended replication times in a surviving cell, while others inhibit mitophagy to favour viral spread. Viral genome replication is catalysed by non-structural protein 5 (NS5), the largest and most conserved protein in the orthoflaviviruses (OFVs). Here, we used quantitative proteomics to identify host cell interactors of Zika virus (ZIKV), Usutu virus (USUV), and West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 proteins. A total of 141 cellular interactors were found, of which 26 were common to all three NS5s. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of those proteins most significantly enriched revealed putative proviral and restriction activities associated. Knockdown of host myoferlin and LGALS3BP led to decreases in the virus titres, suggesting that both positively promote viral replication. Silencing of mitophagy-related prohibitin 2 (PHB2) resulted in significant increases in ZIKV and USUV titres, as well as intracellular levels of genomic RNA. Supporting a connection between this antiviral behaviour and mitophagy, an inhibitor of this pathway also led to larger virus titres and genomic viral RNA. During an infection, PHB2 protein levels gradually decreased, becoming transiently undetectable, and suggesting that it is specifically targeted and degraded by virus-mediated activities. Ectopic expression of NS5 alone did not affect PHB2 intracellular abundance, however a significant decrease was observed in cells expressing the viral protease NS2B/NS3. Its elimination, however, was more pronounced in cells where both viral enzymes were co-expressed, suggesting that NS5 could be assisting PHB2 recognition by NS2B/NS3. Overall, our results support that PHB2 is an orthoflaviviral restriction factor which is targeted for degradation to favour viral replication.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that YTH domain family, member 2 (YTHDF2), a key m6A reader protein that binds m6A-modified RNAs and influences RNA metabolism, is required for HTLV-1 replication in both de novo and persistently infected cells. Mechanistically, YTHDF2 interacts with and stabilizes Tax RNA in an m6A-dependent manner, thereby promoting Tax-driven HTLV-1 replication. Importantly, YTHDF2 activates oncogenic cellular pathways and promotes proliferation in HTLV-1 infected cells, aligning with the functions of Tax.

To uncover the molecular machinery underlying MYO10-positive filopodia, we targeted the fast biotin ligase TurboID to the filopodia tip-localized motor protein MYO10. Proximity biotinylation in two cell types revealed hundreds of potential MYO10 interactors. Surprisingly, there was limited overlap between the cell lines, indicating a previously unknown level of cell-type specificity in filopodia composition. A targeted microscopy and siRNA screen identified MINK1, SCRIB, CSNK1A1, and CCT8 as new regulators of filopodia formation. Focusing on one common interactor between cell lines, CCT8, known as a subunit of the chaperonin TRiC (TCP1 Ring Complex), we found that CCT8 associates with the MYO10 motor domain and regulates MYO10 filopodia independently of TRiC. Depleting CCT8 affected filopodia dynamics and impaired cell spreading, migration, and invasion in breast cancer cells. These findings establish CCT8 as a TRiC-independent regulator of MYO10 filopodia across different cancer cell types, highlight the surprising cell-type-specificity of filopodia composition, and provide a strategy and resource for studying filopodia in various biological contexts.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, how regulatory elements evolve and shape gene expression remains poorly understood, particularly in plants. The well-resolved phylogeny of allopolyploid peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and its diploid progenitors, A. duranensis and A. ipaensis, provides an ideal system to investigate the regulatory evolution at a lineage-specific level. By integrating comparative analyses of sequence similarity, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs), and gene expression, we reconstructed the evolutionary trajectories of Accessible Chromatin Regions (ACRs), where regulatory elements typically reside, and revealed their distinct contributions to homeolog expression bias, unequal expressions between homeologs, in a polyploid genome. Most ACRs exhibited high sequence similarity, comparable chromatin accessibility, and conserved states for H3K4me3, H3K56ac, and H3K36me3, indicating regulatory stability after hybridization and polyploidization. However, a subset of novel ACRs emerged de novo or through sequence mutations in preexisting ACRs, arising at different rates and evolutionary stages. Notably, even highly sequence-conserved ACRs exhibited substantial variation in chromatin accessibility variation, consistent with CNS composition differences and minor sequence variation, although causal relationships remain to be demonstrated. Our analyses further revealed a complex spectrum of CNS dynamics across the diploid-polyploid framework.

In practice, arterial-transit artifacts that generate a hyperintense signal in CBF maps warrant careful consideration. While these effects are well characterized in humans, they are less well understood in mice owing to the marked interspecies physiological differences. Methods: To address this knowledge gap, we systematically characterized pCASL hyperintense signal as a function of post-labeling delay (PLD) and crusher-gradient strength in mice. Numerical simulations were also performed to validate the experimental findings. Results: We found that hyperintense signals in mice extend to arteries, major veins, and ventricular structures (e.g., choroid plexus). Such a pattern was different from human pCASL images, where hyperintense signals are predominantly present in arteries. Statistical analyses supported a PLD of 500 ms as a pragmatic balance between detection sensitivity and suppression of vascular contamination. Additional experiments and numerical simulations showed that, within the tested range, stronger crusher gradients provided little extra vascular suppression-primarily because large vessel calibers relative to small voxels limit intravoxel phase dispersion. These findings refine the interpretation of murine pCASL signals and facilitate more accurate perfusion imaging in preclinical pathophysiological studies.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Since Fos expression peaks with metabolic activity, we use this system to insert synthetic DREADDs into brain-wide neurons that are active under isoflurane anesthesia. We then test the behavioral consequences of chemogenetic stimulation of anesthesia-activated neural ensembles. We observe immobility, discoordination, anti-nociception, and significantly increased anesthetic sensitivity, but not a loss of consciousness as measured by the righting reflex.

As such, the implementation of rigorous monitoring efforts aimed at documenting the actual status of pollinators is of essence especially in the tropics. This can be possible through participatory studies with volunteers (citizen scientists) that emphasizes on apriori research hypotheses with the aim to draw inferences on the potential drivers of species community assemblage patterns. In ecology, photos have the ability to drive change and can provide unbiased evidence on species existence with a potential to compare changes over time and space. However, in the tropics and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, such ideas fall short of public participation. In this study, we aimed to assess and digitally document plants and their bee visitors as important data sources with immense potential to improve on the knowledge and awareness of the different plants and bee species in two counties of Kenya (Taita and Murang'a). Our results showed marked differences in bee community assemblage patterns between the two counties, with a huge number of unique species between them. We successfully digitalised and present photos of 114 bee and 262 plant species. Using these digitalised photographs, we herein elaborate on the community assemblage patterns of plants and their bee pollinators in the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot (EABH) of Kenya and further discuss the importance of exploiting images for research in biodiversity and conservation. We therefore conclude that, technological advances that helps in digitalising species through photography can be important in the successful implementation of community based environmental threat management agendas.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Soil microbial communities, particularly diazotrophs, play a crucial role in different soil system processes, including nutrient cycling, and can improve nitrogen-limited characteristics of nutrient-poor soil systems. Free-living and root-associated nitrogen-fixing bacteria have great potential to enhance nitrogen availability in the nitrogen-limited soil and support host plant growth and nutrient acquisition. Free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and root-associated rhizobacteria contribute a substantial amount of nitrogen to ecosystems, including arid lands. This study evaluated the growth performance and nutrient uptake ability of four native plant species of Kuwait inoculated with a consortium of selected indigenous putative diazotrophs isolated from the Kuwait desert. The seedlings of Vachellia pachyceras were inoculated with both indigenous root-nodule bacteria isolated from Kuwait desert and a commercial inoculum to evaluate their symbiotic efficiency. The seedlings were cultivated under greenhouse conditions in both native desert soils and in potting mix to assess the extent to which growth medium influenced inoculation response. The primary objective was to determine whether the inoculated indigenous N2 fixing bacteria could contribute early seedling development and nutrient acquisition, thereby supporting their potential use them as biofertilizer in future large-scale restoration efforts. Bacterial inoculation significantly enhanced plant dry mass and nutrient uptake across all tested plant species compared to the non-inoculated controls. The magnitude of improvement varied with bacterial density, plant species, and growth medium used. These findings are consistent with evidence that isolated indigenous N2-fixers have the potential to enhance plant growth and nutrient uptake in selected native plant species, supporting their use as biofertilizers for restoration and revegetation efforts in arid environments. This study represents the first evaluation of Kuwaits native seedlings inoculated with indigenous diazotrophs, highlighting their potential for sustainable ecosystem restoration.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Here we combine multigenerational mutation accumulation with whole-genome sequencing in C. elegans to test whether adulthood-only IIS downregulation can simultaneously promote somatic maintenance and limit germline mutational burden. We reduced IIS by adult-onset daf-2 RNAi in wild-type and heritable RNAi-deficient (hrde-1) backgrounds, allowing either spontaneous or UV-induced germline mutations to accumulate over multiple generations. In wild-type animals, reduced IIS lowered germline single-nucleotide mutation rates by up to ~50% and prevented the UV-induced elevation in mutation rate, without detectable costs to fecundity or lineage persistence. By contrast, in hrde-1 mutants the same intervention increased both point mutations and transposable-element driven insertions under UV exposure, accelerating lineage extinction. Thus, the genome-protective effect of reduced IIS critically requires the germline nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, which mediates small-RNA guided epigenetic silencing. Functional annotation of germline variants revealed enrichment in pathways linked to development, cellular maintenance and conserved longevity regulators, including IIS and mTOR, and identified high-impact mutations in genes with human orthologs implicated in neurodegeneration and cancer. Our findings show that IIS can coordinate somatic and germline maintenance in concert, rather than in competition, through an HRDE-1 dependent epigenetic pathway. This work positions nutrient-sensing IIS as a central regulator of germline genome stability and suggests that IIS downregulation can reduce germline mutation load while extending lifespan, with broad implications for biogerontology and evolutionary biology.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

In European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), defining management units has been complicated by a complex evolutionary history and the coexistence of distinct ecotypes. Despite recent advances using high-resolution genomic markers, key uncertainties persist regarding population structure and connectivity, particularly between the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Iberian Waters stocks and their links to neighboring northern and southern regions. Here, we analyze thousands of genetic markers from individuals spanning both assessed stocks and adjacent areas, including representatives of the two recognized ecotypes (marine and coastal). Our comprehensive population genomic analyses identify three major lineages, northern marine, southern marine, and coastal, shaped by historical processes and ecological differentiation. Notably, genetic divergence between ecotypes exceeds that observed among geographically distant populations within the same ecotype, highlighting the need to incorporate ecological as well as spatial drivers when delineating stocks. Our findings demonstrate that current management units do not capture the underlying biological structure of European anchovy, which could lead to local overexploitation due to inadequate Total Allowable Catch (TAC) settings.

L.; Nooij, S.; Carter, C.; Mather, A. E.", "abstract": "Background: Many clinically important antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes such as fluoroquinolones and rifamycins are driven by antimicrobial resistance-conferring mutations (ARMs) in conserved chromosomal loci (e.g., gyrA, parC, rpoB). Resistome profiling by metagenomics sequencing is often proposed as an ideal AMR surveillance tool as it is organism-agnostic, but currently, existing metagenomic AMR surveillance pipelines are only able to identify acquired AMR genes but not point mutations associated with AMR. This is a serious gap in metagenomics-based AMR surveillance, as the true extent of AMR may be underestimated. Methods: We developed MetaPointFinder (v1), a read-based method that can process both long and short metagenomic reads. The tool identifies resistance-determining regions in reads using DIAMOND (translated protein) and KMA (nucleotide), and classifies known resistant versus wild-type variants by aligning the sequences using pwalign and assessing the observed mutations based on known resistance mutations in the AMRFinderPlus database. The tool outputs ARMs per read, per gene and per antibiotic class. Results: In proof-of-concept analyses, MetaPointFinder identified known AMR-associated mutations and quantified resistant/susceptible read counts and ratios from metagenomic samples with corroborating phenotypic resistance data when available. We benchmark our tool using simulated reads from DNA and from reverse-translated protein references with read lengths of 100-5000 bp and error rates between 0 and 30%, simulating both Illumina and Nanopore error rates. We show that MetaPointFinder outperforms any available method for detection of ARMs in metagenomics data. Conclusion: MetaPointFinder complements gene-centric resistome profiling by capturing chromosomal mutation-based AMR directly from metagenomes.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Yet its application in Malus domestica has been limited by heterogeneous reference genomes and the lack of validated marker genes. Here, we first established a comprehensive set of marker genes corresponding to 29 plant cell types and identified their orthologs in apple. Using these resources, we systematically evaluated six publicly available apple genome assemblies as references for snRNA-seq analysis. Our results demonstrate that reference genome selection has a major impact on mapping performance and downstream cell type annotation, with the GDDH13 assembly consistently producing the highest transcript counts per nucleus and the greatest number of identifiable transcriptional clusters (15 clusters representing 11 distinct cell types across 35,557 high-quality nuclei). To achieve robust cell type annotation, we integrated classical marker gene-based annotation with two cross-species computational frameworks--Orthologous Marker Gene Groups (OMGs) and XSpeciesSpanner. These three approaches enabled confident identification of 11 major cell types in apple seedlings and provided cross-validation for ambiguous or previously unannotated clusters. Pseudotime analysis reconstructed the developmental trajectories of both procambial and stomatal lineages, revealing their progressive transcriptional transitions and enabling the delineation of key molecular programs underlying vascular differentiation and early guard-cell formation.

Since inflammatory cells can either constrain or promote tumour growth, understanding how ADAMTS proteases influence immune cell behaviour is crucial. Using syngeneic tumour models -B16F1 melanoma and Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC)- in Adamts1 knockout (Ats1-KO) mice, we observed model-specific outcomes underscoring the complexity of ADAMTS1 function in cancer. Transcriptomic and functional analyses revealed broad alterations in the matrisome and immune-related pathways across both tumour types. Strikingly, while tumour progression was impaired in B16F1-derived tumours, the LLC model -characterized by a stronger myeloid component- showed no dependency on Adamts1. To investigate this apparent resistance, we experimentally depleted macrophages and uncovered a profound functional defect in this population in Ats1-KO mice. In vitro assays confirmed reduced macrophage phagocytic activity. Mechanistically, we identified the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-4 (SDC4), a known ADAMTS1 substrate, as a key mediator of this activity.

L.", "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and graph theory analysis of functional connectivity measures derived from hemodynamic changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can characterize spoken word processing efficiency in neurotypical listeners. Individual differences were assessed by identifying a low performing (Low-P) and a high performing (High-P) individual. Network science and psycholinguistic models of spoken word recognition predict that word frequency and sublexical phonotactic probability of the word form affects the cognitive processing effort. This novel study assesses predictors of processing efficiency directly using functional connectivity measures of global efficiency, local efficiency, modularity, and hubness, derived from listener's frontal lobe hemodynamic response function during a verbal working memory task. Method: A total of 20 neurologically typical participants (ages 18-21) completed an auditory working memory task where participants were required to hold words differing word frequency and sub lexical phonotactic probability in memory. Changes in oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin concentration were recorded with a continuous-wave, multi-channel fNIRS system (TechEn, Inc., Milford, MA) using a 20-channel optode montage across the prefrontal cortex. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between each channel pair to produce 20x20 functional connectivity matrices. Frontal networks were constructed as a graph where nodes in the graph are the light source and edges are connections (e.g., channels) between nodes. Functional connectivity strength and graph theory measures were examined. Results: LF and HF words were not processed differently at the behavioral or brain level. Task performance regardless of word frequency was related to brain measures, with higher strength of prefrontal FC relating of worse accuracy (d-prime) regardless of task block, and with high modularity correlating with slow response times on the LF task, measured by HbR signal. Higher efficiencies tended to correspond to better accuracy but none of the tests were significant. High-P showed low FC strength and high efficiency relative to others, while Low-P had high modularity and low efficiency, in line with the direction of the brain-behavior correlations. Lastly, we characterized the centrally important regions (hubs). These tended to be located in the left inferior area. High-P's hubs overlapped with those showing consistent hubs behavior at the group level, while Low-P's hubs were uncommon.

Here, we investigated how both global and astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 deletion influence seizure susceptibility, astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, and cognition in male mice subjected to a kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy mouse model. Global Fkbp5 knockout (Fkbp5-KO) presented lower seizure activity along with decreased neuronal loss and astrogliosis in the hippocampus compared with the wild-type mice. Astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 conditional knockout (aFkbp5-cKO) mice similarly attenuated seizure severity, decreased astrogliosis, improved novel object recognition, and preserved glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression in hippocampal CA3.

The importance of PknF for the virulence of Mtb in vivo is not known. Here, we demonstrate that the Mtb CDC1551 deletion mutant of pknF ({Delta}pknF) expresses significantly increased levels of the lipid pthiocerol dimycoserosate (PDIM), a polyketide lipid with pro-virulence properties. The {Delta}pknF mutant strain, when compared to the Mtb and complemented strains, had a 100-fold increase in growth at day 28 and about a 10-fold increase in growth at days 90-98 in the lungs of mice. The increase in pulmonary bacterial loads after infection with {Delta}pknF strain was conserved even in Nlrp3-deficient mice, arguing that PknF modulates Mtb virulence independently of NLRP3-inflammasome activation in mice. Staining of lung sections revealed increased inflammation in the lungs of {Delta}pknF strain-infected mice when compared to Mtb and the complemented mutant strain. Highly susceptible B6.Sst1S mice displayed decreased host resistance with significantly decreased survival when infected with the {Delta}pknF strain compared to the complemented strain or Mtb. In conclusion, our data suggest that expression of PknF, as a modulator of multiple downstream effector proteins, restricts the virulence of Mtb in the lungs of mice through an NLRP3 inflammasome-independent mechanism but potentially via suppressing expression of the virulence lipid, PDIM.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRL) are modular, multi-subunit complexes that catalyse ubiquitination of a wide variety of proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome. Substrate specificity is conferred by the substrate receptor subunit of the CRL, of which there are hundreds. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is a drug modality that involves hijacking the activity of CRLs to ubiquitinate non-native neosubstrates via compound-induced ternary complex formation between a substrate receptor and the target. Of the many CRL substrate receptors, the DDB1 and Cul4-associated factor (DCAF) family are of high interest and potential for TPD. To enable characterisation of DCAF proteins and ligand screening campaigns, we have undertaken high-throughput recombinant protein expression screening in insect cells and small-scale plate-based purification of 24 DCAF proteins to identify soluble recombinant protein. Co-expression with the stabilising substrate adaptor DDB1 is required for, or enhances, expression of many DCAFs and provides a folding quality control measure through co-purification with tagged DCAF protein. Of 13 DCAF proteins that had not previously been expressed in the literature, we identify 8 that express well as promising candidates for scale-up.

Within the VNO, pheromones are sensed by two families of G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) the type 1 and type 2 vomeronasal receptors (V1Rs and V2Rs). However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that control the expression of V1R and V2R by vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). Here we show that VSN precursors transiently express Testes-expressed gene 15 (Tex15), which in the germline is required to repress the expression of transposable elements during spermatogenesis. We find that the absence of Tex15 results in a dysregulated VR choice for V1Rs and A, B, and D family V2Rs, which manifest as a less diverse repertoire of VR expressing cells and includes a dramatic reduction in the expression of specific receptors that have been tied to intermale aggression. Accordingly, Tex15 knockout mice exhibit lowered activation in the Accessory Olfactory Bulb (AOB) after exposure to male odorants, and a loss of stereotyped aggression between male mice. Taken together, these results show that Tex15 plays a critical role in pheromone sensing by ensuring that VSNs express a diverse set of receptor proteins.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we provide the first comprehensive assessment of cold tolerance across all developmental stages of Culicoides nubeculosus, a widely used laboratory species that is endemic to northern Europe. Eggs, first-instar larvae, fourth-instar larvae, pupae, and adults were exposed to acute (1 h) and extended (6 and 24 h) cold treatments spanning -1 to -18 {degrees}C, with survival, development, emergence, and adult wing size quantified.

While the effect of cold exposure duration varied across temperatures and life stages, extended exposure generally reduced survival at lower temperatures. Cold stress caused sublethal effects, including reduced adult emergence when eggs or larvae were exposed and reductions in adult wing size of up to ~10%, depending on the life stage. These results reveal substantial cold tolerance across the full life history of C. nubeculosus, suggesting that factors beyond temperature influence population phenology. Our findings provide new insights into Culicoides ecology, with implications for seasonal vector population dynamics and arbovirus transmission risk in temperate regions.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Marsh ecosystems represent ecotones of high ecological significance where terrestrial and aquatic systems converge, governed by strong gradients in salinity and flooding. These environments sustain specialised communities and perform vital ecosystem functions such as carbon sequestration or nutrient cycling. This study examined carabid beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) assemblages across freshwater and saltwater marshes along the Elbe estuary in northern Germany to assess how environmental conditions shape patterns of abundance, diversity, and functional traits. Over 17,000 individuals representing 84 species were collected between March and October 2024. Despite similar species richness between marsh types, community composition differed markedly (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity: 0.92), reflecting environmental filtering along the salinity gradient. Freshwater marshes exhibited greater overall functional richness, while saltwater marshes supported more functionally even and divergent trait distributions, indicating stronger niche specialization under saline stress. Seasonal activity was bimodal in both habitats but peaked earlier in freshwater sites. A generalized linear mixed model revealed significant positive relationships between carabid activity abundance and functional richness of both dispersal- and preference-based traits. These findings demonstrate that salinity and flooding regimes drive distinct taxonomic and functional assemblages, with trait diversity underpinning ecosystem resilience and functioning. The study establishes an ecological baseline for future monitoring of marshland biodiversity and highlights the necessity of conserving functionally diverse communities to maintain the ecological integrity of tidal and floodplain marshes under changing environmental conditions.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

The aim of this study was to uncover the ant diversity across forest successional stages (fallow, secondary forest and primary forest) in the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve, The Democratic Republic of the Congo. These three forest habitats were sampled in six localities with pitfall traps and Winkler extractions. The discovered ant communities, the species typical of each habitat and the effectiveness of both sampling methods are discussed. The results showed that 190 species belonging to 50 genera and 8 sub-families of Formicidae were sampled in the Yangambi region. Ant diversity was lowest in fallow land, higher in secondary forests, and highest in primary forests, reflecting a clear pattern along the successional gradient. A relatively small proportion of ant species were shared among all three habitats, while each habitat also supported a distinct set of species. Primary forests hosted the highest number of exclusive species, followed by secondary forests and fallow land. Winkler extractors captured substantially more ant species than pitfall traps, with nearly 50% greater species richness observed. However, a significant portion of the ant fauna in Yangambi likely remains undocumented, and additional sampling methods could help provide a more complete picture of its biodiversity.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate the interaction between these two types of plasticity in the context of anti-predator defences, using a two-generation laboratory experiment in the snail Physa acuta. Our results revealed that both types of plasticity participate in shaping the within- and transgenerational responses. Within a generation, the limited resource decreases the individual`s somatic state but did not constrain the costly expression of defences. Across generations, the poor state of parents decreased the offspring state, which in turn decreased the absolute levels of their defences. The lower defences of offspring from low-resource parents were, however, compensated by a higher reproductive success. By illustrating the intimately intertwining between information- and state-based plasticity, our study calls for increased study integrating their complex interactions to improve research about the role of phenotypic plasticity in ecology and evolution.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

We propose an ecological, process-based mathematical model describing the dynamics of pollinators and plants, properly mediated by reward resources. Our model explicitly accounts for the main interactions of both facilitative and competitive nature that occur both within and between the two guilds. We apply our model to a broad set of real communities in fragmented landscapes to investigate the mechanisms that link the architecture of the interaction networks, the pollinators' temporal persistence and abundance at the community level, and their rarity at the landscape level. Our results suggest that few generalist pollinators form a core of abundant, persistent and widely distributed species, while a lower number of mutualistic partners is generally associated with low abundance, low persistence and high turnover between patches. Specialists, however, are crucial to maintaining high levels of biodiversity within the community. This finding highlights the importance of ecological connectivity, through which local extinctions can be counter-balanced by recolonizations.

One mechanism by which plants cope with stress conditions is tailoring their microbiomes to aid in stress tolerance. However, experimentally imposing abiotic stresses to examine impacts on tree microbiomes over long timescales is impractical. Naturally occurring climate gradients provide an opportunity to observe the longer-term effects of abiotic stress on soil and tree-associated microbiomes, potentially informing projections on how these relationships will respond to climate change. Populus trichocarpa is an ecologically important tree species, a major source of wood products, a potential bioenergy feedstock, and has emerged as a model species for both biological and ecological processes. To understand how belowground plant-microbe interactions changed across climatic gradients, we collected bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root endosphere samples from P. trichocarpa trees found along a 200 km transect over the Cascade Mountains in Washington, USA within the Cowlitz River Basin on the wetter, western side and along the Tieton River basin on the drier, eastern side. Precipitation rates and temperatures varied considerably over the ~1300-meter elevation span. We performed 16S and ITS2 amplicon sequencing to examine the bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities, as well as soil chemical and physical characteristics, stand characteristics, and host tree physiology. We hypothesized that the soil and P. trichocarpa-associated rhizosphere and root endosphere microbiomes would vary in response to the naturally occurring climate gradient along the transect. We found that for each niche sampled, bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities clustered into three distinct micro-climate groups: a wetter community common across the Cowlitz River sites, a drier community of the lower altitude Tieton River sites, and a high elevation community at the crest of the pass and along the upper Tieton River. The community differences between these micro-climate groups were diminished within the P. trichocarpa root endosphere, though still evident, indicating that while P. trichocarpa may have a selective and homogenizing effect on the microbiome, abiotic factors play a major role in the overall shaping of these microbial communities.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

In the northwest Mediterranean, which includes Catalonia, the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands, and Murcia, fisheries have experienced synchronous declines, a consequence of overexploitation, fragmented governance, and reactive, top-down regulation. In contrast, Andalusia, encompassing both the Atlantic and Alboran Sea coasts, has demonstrated more resilient trajectories, bolstered by greater ecological productivity and the adoption of adaptive governance strategies since the 2010s. In this region, the implementation of gear-specific management plans, rigorous scientific monitoring (including satellite tracking), and prompt administrative responses have facilitated more sustainable exploitation.

However, most applications focus on a global PLS axis for a pooled sample, and there is no simple, widely used procedure to compare whether integration patterns differ between species in the same PLS space. Here I present an angle-based method and an accompanying R function, Integration_Patterns, that quantify between-species differences in integration patterns based on the orientation of the first eigenvector of the within-species covariance matrix in PLS1--PLS1 space. For each species, the method extracts PLS1 scores for two modules, computes the covariance matrix, retrieves the principal eigenvector representing the main axis of covariation, and then measures the angle (0--90{degrees}) between these axes across species. Small angles indicate nearly parallel integration patterns, whereas larger angles indicate divergent or orthogonal patterns. To evaluate the behaviour and robustness of the estimator, I conducted a simulation-based sensitivity analysis using species-specific PLS1 scores. Pairs of species were simulated under known angular separations (0{degrees}, 30{degrees}, 45{degrees}, 60{degrees}, 90{degrees}) and a range of per-species sample sizes (n = 3 to 200). For each combination, 100 replicate datasets were generated and the between-species angle was estimated. The results show that the estimator is biased and highly variable for very small samples (n [&le;] 10), but converges rapidly to the true angle with increasing sample size. For n {approx} 20--30 individuals per species, the mean estimated angle is close to the true value and the standard deviation is substantially reduced across all scenarios, including orthogonal patterns (90{degrees}). These findings provide practical guidance on sample-size requirements when comparing integration patterns across species.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Males make two types of sperm: traditional fertilizing sperm (eupyrene) and a second, non-fertilizing type (apyrene) that lacks a nucleus entirely. Despite decades of study, the function and evolution of this second sperm type has remained unclear. Here we explore the sperm biology of the evergreen bagworm moth, Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis (Lepidoptera: Tineoidea: Psychidae), and find no evidence for non-fertilizing sperm in this species. We generate genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic resources to characterize the apparently monomorphic sperm of this species and compare it to that of other Lepidoptera. The fertilizing sperm of the evergreen bagworm shows key differences from other studied species, especially a lack of proteolytic enzymes used to break down sperm bundles in other species. Combining this and other evidence, we offer new hypotheses for the evolution and function of this enigmatic reproductive trait. Notably, early diverging moths appear to produce far less non-fertilizing sperm in general than later diverging Lepidoptera. We infer that non-fertilizing sperm are not necessary in these taxa, perhaps because less robust packaging of fertilizing sperm enables greater mobility than in later diverging moths.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms through which AR modulates radiation response are not yet fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of AR in mediating radioresistance in PCa. AR-positive LNCaP and castration-resistant C4-2 cells exhibited significantly higher radioresistance than AR-negative cells, as determined by apoptosis and cell viability assays. Following irradiation, most LNCaP cells were arrested in the G1 phase, accompanied by rapid p53 activation and p21 induction. Consistently, AR silencing significantly increased radiosensitivity and reduced DNA-PKcs expression and phosphorylation, suggesting that AR enhances DNA repair, likely through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). At the cellular level, irradiation markedly induced macroautophagy in LNCaP and C4-2 cells, as evidenced by increased LC3B-II accumulation and autophagic vacuole formation, and the upregulation of 11 autophagy-related genes was identified by whole-transcriptomic analysis. To assess their functional relevance, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of selected autophagy-related genes and assessed cell viability and Annexin V/PI staining. Notably, BECN1 and LC3 knockdown significantly enhanced radiosensitivity, with BECN1 knockdown showing an effect comparable to that observed with AR silencing.

Among oncogenic drivers, MYC is central to tumorigenesis, with its deregulation observed in more than 60% of human cancers. Oncogenic MYC profoundly rewires transcription, enabling cells to bypass cell cycle checkpoints and resetting metabolism. A cornerstone of this rewiring is the up regulation of biomass-producing pathways, particularly ribosome biogenesis. How and when MYC oncogenic program is translationally executed, either immediately or until a favorable metabolic context emerges, remains a central unanswered question in tumor initiation, limiting our understanding of tumor latency and early intervention windows. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein LARP1 as a critical effector of MYC-driven transformation, connecting MYC oncogenic activity with mTOR signaling. Mechanistically MYC represses miR-26a/b, relieving post-transcriptional repression of LARP1 and leading to its up regulation. LARP1 associates with the translational machinery loading it with the anabolic translatome induced by MYC in a translationally poised state. Upon permissive mTOR signaling, and dependent on the phosphorylation of LARP1 at serines 689 and 697, this program is rapidly translated, fueling the biosynthetic processes essential for tumor development. Importantly, genetic deletion of LARP1 or pharmacological mTOR inhibition completely abrogates tumor initiation in a genetically engineered colorectal organoid model of MYC-driven tumorigenesis, underscoring the physiological relevance of this two-step mechanism. These findings reveal a fundamental mechanism underlying MYC oncogenesis, whereby LARP1 bridges the anabolic translatome primed by MYC with its metabolic execution controlled by mTOR. By temporally uncoupling transformation from metabolic permissiveness, this mechanism defines a critical checkpoint in early tumorigenesis and reveals a potential vulnerability for intercepting MYC-driven cancer before biomass expansion.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

A known prerequisite for disease is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and previous studies have demonstrated elevated Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibodies which cross-react with the calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin-2 (ANO2) in persons with MS (pwMS). ANO2-reactive antibodies have been associated with greater neuroaxonal damage in MS, although their exact effector function is still uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that ANO2 is also the target of IFN{gamma}-producing CD4+ T cells, which are more frequent in untreated and natalizumab-treated pwMS compared to control individuals. Immunisation of SJL/J mice with either ANO2 or EBNA1 elicited cross-reactive CD4+ T cell and antibody responses in vivo. Pre-immunisation of young mice with ANO2 worsened proteolipid protein (PLP)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which in older mice included atypical clinical phenotype, immune infiltration into the brain and reduced survival. EAE exacerbation was recapitulated with the adoptive co-transfer of ANO2 and myelin antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, and ANO2-specific T cells alone could induce the cell death of ANO2-expressing glial cells in vitro. T cell clones with cross-reactivity to both EBNA1 and ANO2 antigens could be isolated from natalizumab-treated pwMS. Single cell sequencing of EBNA1 and ANO2-specific T cell receptors (TCR) from four pwMS revealed a significant overlap between their antigen-specific expanded TCR repertoires within donors and transcriptomic analysis showed cross-reactive T cells to have predominantly activated and cytotoxic phenotypes. In summary, we report the first mechanistic evidence that EBNA1 CD4+ T cells can target the MS-associated autoantigen ANO2, thereby establishing a link between EBV infection and development of autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Lucinidae, an ancient and species-rich family of marine bivalves, host chemosynthetic sulphur-oxidising bacteria within gill epithelial cells, and is well-known for its contribution to inorganic sulphur cycling in marine sediments worldwide. Little is known about organosulfur transformations by lucinid-associated microbiota or the host's potential contribution. Here, we integrated field measurements, genomics, transcriptomics, and experimental assays to investigate organosulfur cycling in three lucinid species from temperate and tropical environments. Concentrations of the osmolyte dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) in lucinids were typically much higher than in their surrounding environment, and varied with host species and season, but not with symbiont abundance. Indeed, candidate DMSP synthesis DSYB genes were expressed by the animal hosts implying that the host may be the source of DMSP. Furthermore, a newly identified and isolated Candidatus Endozoicomonas endolucinida symbiont was capable of DMSP catabolism to dimethylsulphide (DMS), which could be further syntrophically oxidised by the sulphur-oxidising symbionts that encode methanethiol oxidase genes in their genomes. Finally, incubation experiments supported a combined role of the host and its associated microbiome in organosulfur cycling during stress, with the highest DMSP concentrations measured when holobionts were incubated with antibiotics under anoxic conditions. This study identified a previously unrecognised microbial partner in lucinid symbioses and revealed its potential organosulphur-based metabolic interactions with both the host and the sulphur-oxidising symbionts, highlighting the capacity of these widespread associations to influence global organosulfur cycling.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Additionally, it assesses the potential suitability of the region for this mosquito species. Methods: Mosquito larvae were collected as part of a comprehensive survey of Culicidae in Cochabamba city and its suburbs. Larvae of An. pseudopunctipennis were collected on April 16, 2024, and reared to the fourth instar in the laboratory. One male specimen obtained from collected larvae was pinned. Specimens were morphologically identified using a standard identification key and species re-description. The larval identification was based on its unique spiracular apparatus, while adults were identified by their characteristic black hind tarsomeres and unspotted wing costa. The specimens are preserved in the Laboratory of Medical Entomology at UMSS, Cochabamba. Results: A single larval habitat was identified in Lincoln Park, in the center of Cochabamba. It consisted of a 184-square-meter pond with a cement bottom, clear water with very slow flow from a small spring, and abundant Rhizoclonium algae. A Maxent habitat suitability model indicated that the Cochabamba Valley provides suitable environmental conditions for An. pseudopunctipennis. Conclusions: This study provides the first concrete evidence of An. pseudopunctipennis in Cochabamba city, confirming its presence after decades of speculation. However, its low abundance and limited larval habitats due to urbanization and pollution suggest that it poses no significant malaria transmission risk in the area.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Although existing theory suggests victim coexistence increases with enemy specialization, the dynamics and potential extinction of enemies is generally discounted. Where enemy dynamics have been considered, empirically atypical linear functional responses have been studied. These limitations could over-simplify inferences about enemy-mediated coexistence. We studied the dynamics of two competing victim species and two enemy species with a deterministic model. We derived equilibrium points, and used linear stability analysis, numerical simulations and Floquet theory to determine the influence of enemy specificity and non-linear functional responses on coexistence in this victim-enemy community. We found greater specificity could drive enemy equilibrium points to infeasible values. We found only accelerating enemy functional responses result in stable equilibrium point coexistence of otherwise equivalent competitor victims, in which case greater specificity results in greater stability. Linear and saturating responses produce complex dynamics (neutral or limit cycles, chaos) or extinction, with limit cycle stability highest at intermediate specificity. Our results indicate strict specificity may not maximize coexistence, and enemy functional response critically influences whether enemies promote victim coexistence. They highlight the need to incorporate enemy dynamics into the growing body of theory regarding enemy-mediated diversity maintenance.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Integrated geochemical and omics analyses reveal the rapid successional shift of seabed ecosystem to a novel chemosynthetic system.

Statistical frameworks like the UN SEEA-EA explicitly link ES flows to the extent and condition of ecosystem assets. Yet, the concrete role of EC in shaping ES supply remains only partially understood, as their relationship is complex and varies across services. Consequently, the operational integration of EC into urban ES assessments remains fragmented. Through a systematic review of 110 studies (2005-2024), we evaluated how and to what extent EC has been incorporated into urban ES assessments. For each study, we examined ES assessment methods, types of condition variables, spatial and temporal explicitness, flow types (potential vs. actual), and sustainability considerations. We find that integration is decisively underway, with most studies (87%) using EC variables as inputs, predominantly for regulating services. However, this integration is narrow: it relies on static methods, focuses on potential over actual flows, and favors easily measurable abiotic and structural state variables over functional, compositional, or landscape ones. While spatial explicitness is common (45%), dynamic models are rare (20%), and assessments seldom leverage EC to evaluate ES flow sustainability. Addressing these gaps, by broadening types of EC variables, increasing temporal dynamism, and linking condition to both actual flows and sustainability, will enhance the capacity of urban ES assessments to support the planning and adaptive management of urban greening. It will also help advance the development of urban ecosystem condition and service accounts, thereby increasing the relevance of urban ES assessment knowledge.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

However, whether free-living partners tend to benefit or exploit each other during incipient endosymbiosis remains a dilemma. Rhizobia bacteria are plant endosymbionts capable of initiating root nodules and fixing nitrogen due to genes carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as the symbiosis island (SI). We conjugated marked SIs into the genomes of non-nodulating strains, which was sufficient to generate de novo root nodule-forming endosymbionts. Most novel endosymbionts originated as commensals that incurred no detectable costs to host plants, in contrast to predictions of exploitation. In fact, a third of endosymbionts originated as nitrogen fixing mutualists. Consistent with phylogenetic limits to transfer of MGE function, novel endosymbionts derived from more closely related SI donor and recipient strains showed greater nitrogen fixation. However, we did not detect phylogenetic limits to SI transmission, which could reflect selfish selection for generalized horizontal transfer of this MGE. In fact, the SI was able to displace other genomic elements residing at its characteristic tRNA gene insertion site. We thus provide genetic, genomic, and functional evidence of how MGEs can potentiate and constrain major evolutionary transitions to expand bacterial niches, with cascading effects on host organisms.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

D.; Schraiber, J. G.; Pennell, M.", "abstract": "When researchers want to test for a direct effect of one attribute on another using interspecific data, they need to account for the confounding influence of other attributes that have phylogenetic structure. Accordingly, a suite of approaches have been developed for this purpose, mostly notably the use of phylogenetic regression. However, it has been shown that such methods can be misled by evolutionary events with large effects. We suggest that one widely-applicable solution to this problem can be found by borrowing both from the statistical genetics literature and by digging into the past of phylogenetic comparative methods. In conventional phylogenetic regression, the phylogenetic variance-covariance matrix is included as a random-effect term; here, we argue that it can be advantageous to also include the leading eigenvectors of this matrix as fixed effects. Building on the recent results of Schraiber et al. (2024), we use mathematical analysis and simulations to show under which scenarios this hybrid strategy is effective. We develop a novel approach for visualizing the contributions of different branches of the phylogeny to the eigenvectors of the variance-covariance matrix. We also illustrate how quantile-quantile plots can be used to assess whether the phylogenetic structure has been effectively controlled. We then apply the mixed approach to investigate the co-evolution of gene expression levels of different genes across the phylogeny of cichlid fishes; we show that including the leading eigenvectors likely reduces the false positive rate. To facilitate the use of our visualization approach and of including eigenvectors in phylogenetic regression models, we present a new R package called EIGER. We argue that the approaches we explore here can both help address the statistical problems that arise from large, historical events and more generally, provide richer insights into the nature of phylogenetic confounding.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Deletion of either lysF1a or lysF1b results in lysis defect phenotypes manifest by reduced plaque size and changes to lysis timing in liquid culture. Deletion of both lysF1a and lysF1b genes is lethal to phage propagation supporting holin function. Phages expressing only the LysF1b protein trigger lysis prematurely when exposed to energy poisons while phages expressing only LysF1a do not show early triggering. Lysis recovery mutants were isolated from phages lacking the lysF1b gene and these mutants generated wild type plaque size but triggered lysis prematurely and showed ~65% reductions in burst size. Genome sequencing identified different point mutations that mapped to TMD1 or the C-terminal region of the lysF1a gene. Finally, infection of an M. smegmatis strain that does not produce lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan by either wild type phages or phages carrying the lysF1b deletion showed modest plaque size increases and did not fully complement the lysis defect of phages lacking the lysF1b gene. Collectively, the findings show that both LysF1a and LysF1b function as holins and are required for efficient bacterial lysis. LysF1a does not function as an antiholin but requires the expression of the LysF1b protein for efficient lysis functioning. The requirement of two holins with distinct membrane topologies for host lysis has not been described previously.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

We show that transcription stalling triggers GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of Ser7 residues (Ser7P) on the Pol II C-terminal domain. Unexpectedly, this phosphorylation occurs in trans: obstacles in gene bodies induce Ser7P on Pol II complexes at gene beginnings. This modification enables processive transcription while restraining excessive Pol II degradation by the last resort pathway.

While powerful, current approaches have some limitations in their flexibility and applicability to smaller-scale studies and diagnostic use. The short read lengths provided by the Illumina platform may lack discriminatory power for some closely related species and also pose a challenge for new marker selection and primer design. To address these challenges, we have developed ITS-1/5.8S/ITS-2 rRNA Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read metabarcoding for ovine gastrointestinal nematodes. Samples from two previous field studies, from UK and western Canadian sheep farms were used. ITS-1/5.8S/ITS-2 long-read metabarcoding showed strong concordance with prior ITS-2 data for the major GIN species in both datasets, with minor discrepancies for some low abundance taxa mainly due to differences in reference sequence database representation. We also used the PrimerTC tool to design a new primer pair, EC1 and EC2, to minimize the amplification of off-target fungal sequences derived from fecal DNA and maximize the nematode sequence read depth when ONT ITS-1/5.8S/ITS-2 metabarcoding was applied directly to ovine fecal stool DNA. In summary, ITS-1/5.8S/ITS-2 ONT long-read nemabiome metabarcoding showed good agreement with ITS-2 metabarcoding and the use of primer pair EC1/EC2 should make the approach more tolerant of fecal contamination of parasite material and has the potential for direct application to ovine fecal DNA.

Current treatment options fail to treat Fabry disease adequately and only delay its progression. Preclinical studies on an alternative approach, systemic delivery of nucleoside-modified GLA mRNA (modGLA), suggest improved effectiveness over existing therapies in reducing glycosphingolipid levels in the heart. It remains unclear whether modGLA can rescue Fabry cardiomyopathy phenotypes at the cellular level, which are not faithfully recapitulated in current animal models. To address this, we investigated characteristic phenotypes in two new models of Fabry cardiomyopathy utilizing human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in transcriptomic and functional analyses. These human Fabry disease cardiomyocytes displayed broad transcriptional dysregulation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired reactive oxygen species handling, as well as enhanced decay parameters of calcium transients. Mechanistically, we identified hyperphosphorylated phospholamban as a major player in this calcium dysregulation. Strikingly, modGLA therapy of Fabry cardiomyocytes restored -galactosidase A enzyme activity, reduced glycosphingolipid deposition, and normalized the observed molecular alterations, supporting modGLA therapy as a promising strategy for the treatment of Fabry disease.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

In this study, using single-cell RNA sequencing data of human wounded tissue we identified a distinct population of migrating keratinocytes marked by the high expression of the mitophagy regulator BNIP3 during the proliferative stage of wound healing. Pharmacological induction of mitophagy with Urolithin A accelerated keratinocyte migration in vitro as well as keratinocyte function and regeneration in aged zebrafish, whilst RNA sequencing of primary human keratinocytes revealed the transcriptional upregulation of ANGPTL4 in Urolithin-A treated cells. Mechanistically, Urolithin A increased metabolic switching to a more glycolytic phenotype, leading to AKT29 GSK3 pathway activity and FOSL1-mediated ANGPTL4 transcription, ultimately promoting keratinocyte migration through enhanced laminin-332 production. Overall, our findings uncover a novel role for mitophagy in promoting keratinocyte migration during wound repair, and demonstrate that pharmacologically enhancing mitophagy promotes regenerative epithelial responses by enhancing FOSL1-mediated ANGPTL4 signalling through the modulation of metabolic switching.

Although FOXG1 is well known for its neuronal functions, its role in glial pathology remains poorly understood. Here, we show that reducing FOXG1 selectively in neurons impairs oligodendrocyte lineage progression and myelination, establishing a critical non-cell autonomous role for neuronal FOXG1 in glial maturation. To restore FOXG1 in neurons, we developed AAV vectors expressing human FOXG1 under neuron-specific promoters. Neonatal administration of these vectors normalized oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) accumulation, enhanced myelination, and corrected hippocampal structural abnormalities in Foxg1 conditional heterozygous mice. To test therapeutic robustness under stringent conditions, we used the patient-specific W300X heterozygous model, which combines FOXG1 loss-of function with a toxic truncated protein and represents one of the most severe FOXG1 syndrome genotypes. Remarkably, neuron-restricted AAV-FOXG1 delivery produced substantial rescue even in this high-bar model, suppressing OPC overaccumulation, restoring myelination, and progressively improving dentate gyrus morphology, with benefits persisting into adulthood. Moreover, adolescent administration remained highly effective, rescuing myelination, axonal bundle thickness, and microglial activation.

However, the CES1 genomic region is difficult to resolve because of adjacent highly homologous pseudogenes and the presence of large structural variants. These complexities often cause read misalignment and inaccurate variant calling with conventional short-read sequencing, hindering reliable pharmacogenomic analyses. To overcome these limitations, we employed an optimized, PCR-free Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing method, Cas9-directed targeted sequencing (nCATS), to characterize the targeted region of up to 76 kb, including CES1, CES1P1 or CES1A2, and their intergenic regions. This approach uses Cas9 to selectively enrich and sequence long native DNA fragments, while avoiding amplification-induced artefacts. Long-read sequencing was performed in 23 human blood samples and the HepG2 hepatoblastoma cell line enabling high-resolution mapping to the CES1 locus. We uncover five previously unrecognized main CES1 haplotypes and report that many single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in public databases are likely artefacts caused by short-read misalignment. Additionally, we identify long inverted repeats (LIRs) flanking a fragile genomic site within the region, which may form DNA hairpins and contribute to structural plasticity at the locus. This study demonstrates the utility of long-read sequencing for resolving complex genomic regions such as CES1, allowing comprehensive detection of structural variants and haplotype-resolved SNVs.

Here, we report the first NMR structure of the class V lasso peptide, gelatinamin A. Using heterologous expression of the gelatinamin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in Bacillus subtilis, we delineated the biosynthetic pathway through targeted gene dele-tions. We expressed and characterized the predicted transpeptidase, GelP, that catalyz-es the formation of an isopeptide bond between Lys2 and the C-terminus and mediates the reversible conversion of gelatinamin B to gelatinamin A. In addition, we characterize GelT, an N-acetyltransferase that inactivates lasso peptide antimicrobial activity by acetylating a key lysine residue. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gelatinamin is highly potent against several important pathogens and that the activity is strongly bicarbonate-dependent. Finally, we propose a complete biosynthetic pathway for gelatinamin.

This specificity allows BIRC6 to ubiquitinate downstream substrates (e.g., caspases) and thereby regulate apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies UBA6-mediated specific activation of BIRC6 remains elusive. Here, we used a UbDha (Ub residue 76 dehydroalanine) probe to achieve one-step, activity-based trapping of the transient transthioesterification intermediate, and resolved the cryo-EM structures of two key complexes: 1) the doubly loaded UBA6-BIRC6^UBC-UbT-UbA complex (3.4 angstrom) and 2) the singly loaded UBA6-BIRC6^UBC-UbT complex (3.3 angstrom). Structural analysis reveals that the specific BIRC6-UBA6 pairing is dictated by steric compatibility between an insertion loop (residues 4649-4653) in BIRC6's UBC domain and UBA6's gate helix. Unlike UBA1, UBA6 avoids steric clash with this insertion loop via two key conformational changes: a ~30 degree clockwise rotation and a 19 angstrom displacement of its gate helix. These conformational changes collectively create a compatible cavity to accommodate the insertion loop. Biochemical validation confirms two key findings: 1) truncating BIRC6's insertion loop rescues UBA1-mediated ubiquitin charging of BIRC6's UBC domain; 2) swapping UBA6's gate helix with that of UBA1 abolishes UBA6's transthioesterification activity towards BIRC6 UBC domain.

Current cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays are invasive and unsuitable for large-scale or repeated screening. Blood-based biomarkers have achieved sensitivities above 90%, but still face challenges of standardization, cost, technical complexity, and the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Saliva offers an attractive, non-invasive solution; however, the low concentrations of AD biomarkers have thus far hindered its clinical applicability. Here, we introduce a saliva-based diagnostic platform that combines Total Internal Reflection Scattering (TIRS) microscopy with antibody-functionalized metallic nanoparticles (NPs), for ultrasensitive, real-time quantification of salivary amyloid-{beta} proteins. Using two established AD mouse models (APPsl and 5xFAD), we found that salivary A{beta}; levels robustly distinguish transgenic from wild-type animals and correlate with brain amyloid deposition. Pooled and stratified analyses suggest these associations are primarily driven by the transgenic-wild-type contrast rather than linear changes within groups. Predictive modeling further confirmed diagnostic utility: in APPsl, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers both achieved 92% accuracy with balanced sensitivity and specificity, while in 5xFAD, SVM reached 88% accuracy with perfect specificity. These results establish the NPs-enhanced TIRS sensor as a rapid, accurate and non-invasive tool for AD detection via saliva.

We used topological analysis to identify regulatory circuits and found that the TFs participating in these circuits, especially those acted as sensor or actuator are highly relevant to cellular response to external signals.

However, systemic side effects and suboptimal tumor specificity hamper the clinical utility of both standard and novel specific therapies. In this study, we developed passive- and active-targeting liposomes encapsulating Cisplatin (CDDP) and Alpelisib. To achieve active targeting, the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody Cetuximab was conjugated to the liposome surface. All formulations were characterized based on size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and drug release profiles. In vitro assays demonstrated that liposomal encapsulation preserved the cytotoxic effects of both CDDP and Alpelisib in HNSCC cell lines, with CDDP showing adequate encapsulation efficiency for in vivo evaluation. In vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging demonstrated that active-targeting liposomes achieved greater tumor accumulation and a better tumor-to-spleen ratio compared to passive formulations. Tumor growth by CDDP-loaded active-targeting liposomes was comparable to that of the free drug, likely due to the hydrophilic nature and rapid release of CDDP from liposomes in physiological conditions. Importantly, blood chemistry analysis indicated a favorable toxicity profile for the targeted liposomal formulation.

Dysregulation of AQP4 localization is implicated in various neuropathologies, but its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Although astrocytes and microglia both express {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}-AdRs), whether {beta}-AdR signaling modulates astrocytic AQP4 polarization through microglial activation has not yet been investigated. Here, we hypothesized that microglial activation mediates the {beta}-AdR-induced loss of astrocytic AQP4 polarization. To test this hypothesis, we topically applied the {beta}-AdR agonist, isoproterenol, to the primary visual cortex of anesthetized mice and evaluated AQP4 polarization using double immunohistochemistry. Acute {beta}-AdR activation (3 h) significantly reduced perivascular AQP4 polarization and enhanced local microglial reactivity. Both pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity with minocycline and microglial depletion via dietary administration of the CSF1R antagonist, PLX5622, prevented AQP4 dysregulation induced by isoproterenol. These findings demonstrate that microglial activation is required for {beta}-AdR agonist-induced AQP4 dysregulation in the mouse cortex, revealing a previously unrecognized microglia-astrocyte interaction linking adrenergic signaling to glial water homeostasis.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Relative to the bacterial peritrichous flagellar motors, the polar flagellar motors are the faster rotational machines and transmit high torque to drive bacterial high-speed motility in liquid and empower swimming in viscous environments. However, the structural basis of high-torque transmission of the polar flagellar motors is still unclear. Here we present an atomic-resolution cryo-electron microscope structure of the polar flagellar motor in complex with the hook from Vibrio alginolyticus, comprising 295 subunits from 18 proteins. Extensive inter-subunit interactions and additional phospholipids generate the higher rigidity of the rod. The LP ring utilizes more electrostatic charges on the inner surface and less physical contacts to facility the higher-speed rotation of the rod. The additional HT ring tightly binds to the outer surface of the LP ring to enhance the LP-ring stability. A previously function-unknown component FlrP enhances the interactions of 15 FliF peptides of the MS ring with the rod and stabilizes the LPHT and MS rings. The hook has two different states, L- and R-state, which provides structural flexibility of the hook to drive the unique forward-reverse-flick motility of the bacteria in the flicking process. This study provides unprecedented molecular insights into evolution and structural adaptions of the bacterial polar flagellar motors for high-torque transmission.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

To investigate this, we generated KCNQ1 knockouts (KO) in human induced pluripotent stem cell lines and differentiated them into neural stem cells (NSCs) and cortical neurons. KCNQ1-deficient NSCs showed impaired neurite outgrowth, linked to reduced cell adhesion and disrupted neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) signalling. This phenotype was reproduced in wild-type and heterozygous lines by pharmacological KCNQ1 inhibition. Whole transcriptome, proteome, and follow-up analyses revealed mitochondrial dysfunction in KO NSCs, including reduced mitochondrial copy number and ATP synthase expression. Additionally, evidence was obtained for an impairment of insulin signalling in NSCs and neurons, with diminished insulin receptor gene expression and perturbation of key downstream signalling pathways (RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT). In neurons, KCNQ1 loss resulted in decreased synaptic activity and a more immature gene expression profile. Overall, our work reveals a novel role for KCNQ1 in human neurodevelopment by regulating cell adhesion, mitochondrial function, and insulin signalling. This work increases our understanding of KCNQ1 function in neurons and its contribution to neurological phenotypes observed in patients with KCNQ1-related diseases.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

However, the large size of the EYS coding sequence (~9.4 kb) exceeds the packaging limit of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, posing a major barrier to gene replacement therapy. To address this challenge, we developed a tripartite AAV vector system that enables delivery and reconstitution of the full-length EYS gene using a Cre-lox-based unidirectional DNA recombination strategy, Uni-STAR (Uni-directional and Site-specific Transgene Assembly by Recombination). The system consists of three AAV constructs carrying discrete EYS segments flanked by engineered, non-compatible lox sites that drive ordered and unidirectional recombination in target cells. We validated this system in vitro by demonstrating successful reconstitution and expression of full-length EYS protein in HEK293T cells. In vivo, subretinal co-injection of the three AAV vectors into mouse eyes led to precise reconstitution and expression of full-length EYS protein in the retina. These findings establish the feasibility of using a tripartite AAV system to deliver the complete EYS gene and provide a foundation for future therapeutic development targeting EYS-associated retinal degenerations.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

It acquired nuclear localization signal after gene duplication and although studies have shown some significant roles of nuclear Praja1, comprehensive analysis still lacks. In this study, we performed comparative proteomics and biochemical analyses to elucidate the functions of Praja1 in the nucleus. First, proteomics analysis applied to nuclear localization deficient Praja1 exhibited signs of DNA damage response fluctuation. Subsequent comet assay revealed Praja1 protecting cells from various DNA damage sources. Similarly, cells lacking Praja1 became more sensitive to DNA damage-induced cell death, while E. coli expressing Praja1 exhibited resistance to DNA damage. To further elucidate the molecular basis of DNA protection, gel shift assay showed direct binding of Praja1 to DNA through electrostatic interactions within its intrinsically disordered region. Further in vitro damaging assay suggested that Praja1 may induce structural changes that enhance DNA repair efficiency upon binding to DNA. Together, these results provide insights into the evolutionarily novel role of nuclear Praja1 in protecting against DNA damage.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Gene regulatory innovation underlies many phenotypic transitions. Transposable elements are an established mechanism for creating families of cis-acting elements with shared sequence features and the potential to establish co-regulatory networks. To understand additional mechanisms by which co-regulatory networks form, we define families of noncoding elements based on sequence similarity and cell type-specific activity. We apply this analysis framework to the human telomere-to-telomere genome assembly and embryonic stem cell chromatin accessibility data. We identify segmental duplications as the major mechanism establishing these families, creating over one thousand networks of elements with open chromatin in embryonic stem cells. We functionally validate a subset of these networks as families of regulatory elements with STARR-seq and identify their target genes with CRISPRi in embryonic stem cells. Following segmental duplication, we find that regulatory elements at times maintain their relationship to target genes, and at times rewire to form novel connections. During this rewiring, we observe proximal-acting elements gaining the ability to regulate distally-located genes and observe transcriptional enhancers rewiring to regulate genes present at the locus outside the segmental duplication. Many of these rewiring events are human specific. Finally, we find that segmental duplications have made outsized contributions to expanding regulatory element families functioning in immune cell types and specific brain regions, including the posterior cingulate gyrus. We speculate that placing regulatory elements in new genomic contexts primes regulatory elements for neofunctionalization, and that regulatory rewiring after segmental duplication was a common mechanism underlying gene regulatory change during human evolution.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

E.; Zhang, H.", "abstract": "Clopidogrel is a widely used antiplatelet prodrug to treat acute coronary syndromes. However, its clinical efficacy is hampered by ineffective bioactivation to produce the pharmacologically active metabolite (AM), leading to variability in antiplatelet response among different ethnic groups. To overcome the shortcomings of clopidogrel, DT-678 was developed by conjugating the AM to 3-nitropyridine-2-thiol via a mixed disulfide bond. It has been challenging to produce the conjugate in high yield by chemical synthesis. Here, we report the first de novo biosynthesis of DT-678 using engineered CYP102A1 variants. We applied structure-based computational design using UniDesign to generate three variants (UD4, UD5, and UD6) that enhanced the catalytic activity and selectivity toward DT-678 synthesis. Among them, UD6 demonstrated the highest total turnover number and DT-678-specific productivity under optimized conditions. Mechanistic analysis revealed that rapid enzyme inactivation, driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, limited overall yield. Remarkably, we found that ascorbic acid significantly protected CYP102A1 variants from inactivation and hence increased production yield. This work establishes a scalable enzymatic strategy for DT-678 biosynthesis and highlights the importance of combining protein engineering with redox control to overcome limitations in CYP-catalyzed reactions.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Molecules are binned on a grid whose width is chosen near the mode of the per-gene unit-invariant knee (UIK) distribution derived from Morisita's I{delta}--width curves. Pairwise adjacency-weighted spatial association is quantified with Lee's L. We then assemble a spatial gene network and identify gene modules by consensus clustering. To identify cell--cell interactions between different cell types, high Lee's L and low Pearson's r is examined. Applied to human colorectal cancer (three Xenium sections) and a lymph node, geneSCOPE recovered spatial gene modules that map to microanatomy such as invasive margins, luminal epithelium, fibroblast-rich territories and germinal-center subdomains, and highlights intercellular neighborhood patterns at tumor-stroma interfaces between LGR5-marked stem-like tumor programs and C3-centered fibroblast/complement-associated niches. geneSCOPE thus provides a scalable, interpretable analytical foundation that generalizes across spatial omics and supports a wide range of applications.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

Motivated by prior observations that the hypomorphic CYB5R3 T117S blunts hydroxyurea-induced fetal hemoglobin responses in patients with sickle cell disease, we tested whether CYB5R3 contributes to the regulation of erythropoiesis. Hematopoietic lineage-specific CYB5R3 knockout mice exhibited markedly impaired erythropoietic induction in response to chronic hypoxia compared to controls, with males showing a more pronounced deficit, and splenectomy further exacerbating this impairment. Genetic deletion of CYB5R3 in human CD34 progenitors reduced globin expression and disrupted terminal erythroid differentiation. Meanwhile, CYB5R3 knockdown in K562 cells produced a heme-deficient state whereby only exogenous heme but not hydroxyurea, iron, or upstream precursors restored globin synthesis. Transcriptomic profiling revealed coordinated downregulation of erythroid transcription factors and multiple enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, which was reversed with heme treatment. Together, these results reveal an unexpected function for CYB5R3 beyond met-hemoglobin reduction, positioning it as a central metabolic regulator of sex-specific stress erythropoiesis and unveiling a heme-restricted vulnerability that may augment disease severity in anemia, hemoglobinopathies, and individuals carrying CYB5R3 loss-of-function variants.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}

However, how actomyosin dynamics drives epithelial remodeling in amniotes remains poorly understood. In this study, we generated transgenic quail lines reporting actin and myosin and investigate their dynamics in gastrulating embryos. We show that during this process, epithelial remodeling events are closely associated with the contraction of junctional myosin. Although we observe medio-apical contractile flows, those appear to contribute to junction contraction by promoting junctional myosin recruitment.

Efforts to describe subglacial microbiomes have been limited by the challenge of cleanly drilling through hundreds of meters of ice, such that only a few sites have ever been directly sampled. Here we use ancient metagenomics to present the first spatiotemporal characterization of subglacial bacteria and archaea. We extracted DNA from 25 subglacial precipitate samples, sedimentary accumulations of minerals that form in subglacial waters prior to exposure on the surface. The precipitates studied here formed between 16,000 and 570,000 years ago beneath the Antarctic and Laurentide Ice Sheets. We show that postmortem DNA damage patterns can reliably distinguish between ancient subglacial and modern surface taxa, and that this approach can enable reconstruction of subglacial microbiomes across poles and ice ages. Our analysis suggests that subglacial microbiomes are dominated by chemolithoautotrophs, ultra-small microbes, and taxa closely related to those found in deep subsurface or extreme cold and hypersaline environments. These microbiomes split into two distinct clusters distinguished by oxygen availability and redox conditions, irrespective of geography or age. Geochemical measurements of subglacial redox state, measured either indirectly via precipitate calcite Fe and Mn concentrations or directly via water reduction potential, reproduce these same two clusters exactly. Our findings describe how subglacial water redox states are held in balance by microbes, hydrology, and oxygen input from fresh subglacial meltwater, that we interpret to be controlled by the ice sheet response to past climate variations.", "date": "2025-12-05", "journal": ""}
