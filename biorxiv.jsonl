C.", "abstract": "Humans and animals can flexibly choose their actions based on different information, ranging from objective states of the environment (e.g., apples are bigger than cherries) to subjective preferences (e.g., cherries are tastier than apples). Whether the brain instantiates these different choices by recruiting either specialised or shared neural circuitry remains debated. Specifically, domain-general accounts of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function propose that prefrontal areas flexibly process either perceptual or value-based evidence depending on what is required for the present choice, whereas domain-specific theories posit that PFC sub-areas, such as the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), selectively integrate evidence relevant for perceptual decisions. Here we comprehensively test the functional role of the left SFS for choices based on perceptual and value-based evidence, by combining fMRI with a behavioural paradigm, computational modelling, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Confirming predictions by a sequential sampling model, we show that TMS-induced excitability reduction of the left SFS selectively changes the processing of decision-relevant perceptual information and associated neural processes. In contrast, value-based decision making and associated neural processes remain unaffected. This specificity of SFS function is evident at all levels of analysis (behavioural, computational, and neural, including functional connectivity), demonstrating that the left SFS causally contributes to evidence integration for perceptual but not value-based decisions.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

To increase knowledge in this area, we have examined the cis-regulation of the transcription factor dlx2b during zebrafish larval tooth formation. We have created a GFP knock-in line that replicates dlx2b expression during tooth development and have also isolated a minimal enhancer of dlx2b (MTE) sufficient for activating most of the tooth germ expression pattern. We have found that four evolutionarily conserved predicted transcription factor binding sites are required for the function of this minimal enhancer in both contexts. When the conserved sequences are mutated in a transgene it eliminates the activity of the enhancer and when they are deleted at the dlx2b locus it causes a dramatic alteration in the expression pattern. We hypothesize that disabling this enhancer at the dlx2b locus may be enabling other nearby cis-regulatory elements to take control of the promoter. These experiments reveal details of how cis-regulatory elements are working to control gene expression during organogenesis and highlight that much remains to be learned by empirical studies of gene regulation.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Revealing the consequences of social structure in animal societies is largely determined by our ability to accurately estimate functionally relevant patterns of social contact among individuals. Of particular relevance are social contacts that drive and maintain the cohesion of moving animal groups. To date, studies have predominantly built up social structure from dyadic connections, which while effective in open societies-where groups are ephemeral-may not be sufficient to characterise the fine-grained structure within more cohesive animal groups. This is because associations or interactions can involve more than two individuals participating together, which current approaches cannot distinguish from independent sets of dyadic connections. Here we apply higher-order temporal network approaches to high-resolution GPS data from every group member in two cohesive groups of vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum). By quantifying moment-by-moment association dynamics, we reveal clear sex-biased contributions to the group cohesion. Specifically, males form the cohesive core of the group as they participate in temporally consistent sub-groups and tend to occupy forward positions when in movement. Females instead remain peripheral and are more likely to leave sub-groups, while also occupying rear positions in moving sub-groups. These results reveal how the cohesion among males, which were previously found to be more likely to lead group movements, allows them to more often form a majority, confirming that self-organisation within the group can drive leadership patterns independently of dominance. Our study thus demonstrates that sub-group association dynamics derived from high-resolution GPS data can provide insights in how the fine-scale spatial and social organisation of cohesive groups, and their temporal dynamics, can explain key processes like leadership.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that tolerated persistent infections also required persistent host reverse-transcriptase (HRT) activity, and this was subsequently proven using the RT inhibitor AZT (azidothymidine, a nucleoside analogue antiretroviral drug) to treat C6/36 cells challenged with DENV-1. We confirmed this using the RT inhibitor tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with C6/36, U4.4cells challenged with DENV-1. However, it has never been determined whether the persistently tolerated infections are also dependent on persistent HRT activity. This brief report reveals that persistent HRT activity is required to maintain persistent DENV-2 infections. Specifically, TDF treatment (0.1 mM) revealed minor toxicity to naive C6/36 cells but led to cell death instead of accommodation upon concomitant challenge with DENV-2, as previously reported for DENV-1. However, TDF treatment of stable, grossly normal C636 cell cultures persistently infected with DENV-2 for up to 30 split passages reverted to CPE, supporting our earlier hypothesis that persistent host RT activity is also required to maintain persistent infections.

DNA damage in neurons increases with chronological age and accelerates in neurodegenerative disorders, resulting in cellular and systemic dysregulation. Distinct DNA damage response strategies have evolved with a host of polymerases. The Y-family translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases are well known for bypassing and repairing damaged DNA in dividing cells. However, their expression, dynamics, and role if any, in enduring postmitotic differentiated neurons of the brain are completely unknown. We show through systematic longitudinal studies for the first time that DNA polymerase kappa (POLK), a member of the Y-family polymerases, is highly expressed in neurons. With chronological age, there is a progressive and significant reduction of nuclear POLK with a concomitant accumulation in the cytoplasm that is predictive of brain tissue age. The reduction of nuclear POLK in old brains is congruent with an increase in DNA damage markers. The nuclear POLK colocalizes with damaged sites and DNA repair proteins. The cytoplasmic POLK accumulates with stress granules and endo/lysosomal markers. Nuclear POLK expression is significantly higher in GABAergic interneurons compared to excitatory pyramidal neurons and lowest in non-neurons, possibly reflective of the inherent biological differences such as firing rates and neuronal activity. Interneurons associated with microglia have significantly higher levels of cytoplasmic POLK in old age. Finally, we show that neuronal activity itself can lead to an increase in nuclear POLK levels and a reduction of the cytoplasmic fraction. Our findings open a new avenue in understanding how different classes of postmitotic neurons deploy TLS polymerase(s) to maintain their genomic integrity over time, which will help design strategies for longevity, healthspan, and prevention of neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, we demonstrate that loss of araucan function causes dorsal wing scales to shift from golden-brown to blue iridescence, and eyespot center scales to shift from saturated purple-violet to dull grey-brown. These phenotypes are associated with changes in thickness of the lower lamina in scale cells, a structural feature known to influence thin-film interference, along with reduction of pigmentation in ground scales. Together, these results identify araucan as a single transcription factor that determines coloration by simultaneously regulating both photonic architecture and light-absorbing pigmentation, and show that these effects can be regulated in pattern-specific manner.

We performed phenotypic selection analyses on parents and hybrids in each species' habitat in Yosemite NP, CA during years of drastically differing snowpack.

We found interannual fluctuations in phenotypic selection, sometimes in unpredicted directions.

The cold-inducible RNA-binding protein RBM3 is highly expressed in nasopharyngeal tissue and is known to stabilise mRNAs under hypothermic conditions; however, its role during viral infection has not been defined. Here, we identify RBM3 as a key host factor that facilitates IAV replication at sub-physiological temperatures. siRNA-mediated depletion of RBM3 significantly impaired viral replication, while its constitutive overexpression at 37{degrees}C restored replication to levels typically observed at 33{degrees}C. Mechanistically, RBM3 binds directly to viral nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA, prolongs its half-life, and promotes the formation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules. This effect was abolished in an RNA-binding-deficient RBM3 mutant, confirming the requirement for direct RNA interaction. Crucially, this positive regulation of NP mRNA was validated in well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cells, highlighting the physiological relevance of RBM3 in the human URT. These results reveal a temperature-sensitive host-virus interaction that promotes IAV replication in the cooler URT, a key site for viral shedding and transmission. By linking environmental temperature, host RNA-binding proteins, and viral mRNA stability, this study uncovers a novel mechanism of respiratory virus adaptation and identifies RBM3 as a potential therapeutic target for limiting early-stage viral replication and transmission.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

In Caenorhabditis elegans, crawling and swimming constitute discrete gaits that differ in curvature, frequency, and mechanical load, providing a tractable model for studying activity-dependent remodeling. Using confocal imaging of phalloidin-stained body-wall myocytes, we quantified myocyte geometry, sarcomere length, and sarcomere number across anterior, medial, and posterior regions in animals reared exclusively under crawling or swimming conditions. Quantification and hypothesis testing used linear mixed models that accounted for repeated myocyte measurements within animals, with interaction terms testing region-specific effects of locomotor condition after IQR based outlier removal. Swimming produced characteristic remodeling of body-wall muscles. Myocytes elongated globally, while selectively thinning in the mid-body, reducing cell area by ~13% relative to crawlers. Shape metrics confirmed this shift: circularity declined at mid- and tail regions and anisotropy increased by ~2-3 units. Sarcomere architecture exhibited parallel remodeling. Average sarcomere length shortened across the body (-0.19 micrometers in head, -0.35 micrometers in mid-body, -0.20 micrometers in tail), while sarcomere number increased anteriorly and medially (+0.77 and +0.65 sarcomeres per myocyte). The medial region also showed a significant rise in sarcomere density, indicating tighter serial packing. These adaptations mirror functional compartmentalization predicted from gait kinematics and parallel fast-fiber remodeling observed in vertebrate muscles. The results indicate that C. elegans muscles adapt their contractile lattice to sustained mechanical demand, linking neural gait selection and mechanosensitive signaling to long-term structural plasticity. This work establishes C. elegans as a model for dissecting the conserved pathways that couple muscle use to cellular architecture and provides a foundation for future comparisons of healthy and diseased muscle remodeling.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

In this study, we identified exosome-mediated delivery of the EBV oncoprotein LMP1, which acts via induction of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), as a key mechanism driving immunosuppressive macrophage polarization. Immunohistochemistry revealed that, in addition to tumor cells, LIF is primarily expressed by stromal TAMs and correlates with poor prognosis. We demonstrated that LMP1-containing exosomes are internalized by macrophages, leading to NFKB-dependent upregulation of LIF and polarization toward an immunosuppressive M2d-like phenotype. These macrophages exhibit impaired anti-tumor activity and promote tumor proliferation and vascular dissemination in a LIF-dependent manner. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of exosome-treated NPC biopsies revealed transcriptional reprogramming across tumor, myeloid, and lymphoid compartments impacting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in tumor cells; immunosuppressive signaling (e.g., CD163 anti-inflammatory and VEGF signaling in macrophages); and enrichment of immune checkpoints and pathways, including PD-1, TGFB;-SMAD, and NFKB-associated pathways in T cells. Exosome treatment increased expansion of CCL18+-TAMs and expression of CTLA4 in regulatory T cells and exhausted T cells. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed a positive correlation between expression of LIF and CTLA4 in NPC tumors and an inverse correlation between LIF and GZMB/CD8A.

This redundancy can hinder taxonomic classification, leading to difficulties distinguishing between closely related sequences and increasing computational demands. While some novel taxonomic classification tools address this redundancy by selecting a subset of genomes as references, insights regarding the impact of different reference genome selection methods across taxonomic classification tools are lacking. Results: We systematically evaluate genome selection and dereplication methods on bacterial and viral datasets using simulated metagenomic samples. We show that the impact of reference genome selection is strongly context-dependent. For bacterial profiling, incorporating all available genomes generally yields the highest accuracy, while having a limited impact on computational resource usage. In contrast, for highly redundant SARS-CoV-2 datasets we find that stringent hierarchical clustering-based selection significantly improves lineage-level abundance estimation accuracy. Incorporation of location-based metadata further enhances viral profiling performance by prioritizing locally relevant genomes. Across viral experiments, smaller reference sets significantly reduce memory and runtime requirements during both indexing and profiling, although this comes at an additional pre-processing cost. Conclusions: Reference genome selection influences both accuracy and computational efficiency in taxonomic profiling, although its benefits seem context-dependent. In diverse bacterial communities, comprehensive reference sets appear optimal, whereas in redundant viral datasets smaller and metadata-informed reference sets work best. These results demonstrate that reference set design does not have a one-size-fits-all solution, and that selection strategies should be adapted based on the biological and computational setting.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Among the six MANs in Arabidopsis, AtMAN2 and AtMAN5 contain a transmembrane domain at their N-terminal region instead of a signal peptide. Subcellular localization using MAN protein fused with fluorescent protein demonstrated that AtMAN2 localizes to the endomembrane system including the Golgi apparatus in xylem and interfascicular fiber cells. We found that an Arabidopsis man2 man5 double mutant lost 65% of glucomannan in the cell walls of the inflorescence stem. Immunostaining and immunoelectron microscopic observation also revealed that the man2 man5 double mutant lost glucomannan in the cell walls to about the same extent as the csla2 csla9 double mutant, which lacks major glucomannan synthases. A gene complementation experiment showed that the catalytic activity of AtMAN2 is important for the function in synthesis of glucomannan for the cell wall. Arabidopsis possesses another atypical MAN, AtMAN6, with an HDEL retention signal at its C-terminus. However, mutation of AtMAN6 did not affect glucomannan content in the cell walls, suggesting distinct functions for these MANs.

Instead, the node degrees and strengths are well approximated by lognormal distributions, although these lack a mechanistic explanation in the context of the brain. By acknowledging the physical network nature of the brain, we show that neuron size is governed by a stochastic multiplicative process, which allows us to analytically derive the lognormal nature of the neuron length distribution.

F.; Al-Abed, Y.", "abstract": "Azapeptide modification, achieved by substituting backbone -carbons with nitrogen atoms to form enzyme-resistant semicarbazide bonds, can markedly enhance peptide stability and therapeutic potential. However, broad application has been constrained by two major synthetic challenges: the lack of suitable building blocks and the reduced nucleophilicity of the semicarbazide amino group, which limits post-coupling efficiency in automated solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Here, we describe a fully automated azapeptide synthesis platform that employs Fmoc-protected benzotriazole esters as bench-stable, pre-activated aza-amino acid building blocks. Microwave-assisted synthesis was integrated to accelerate aza-residue incorporation and improve coupling efficiency. This plug-and-play approach enables rapid solid-phase assembly of azapeptides, substantially reducing reaction times and improving yields. To demonstrate its utility, we synthesized azapeptide analogues of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) with targeted substitutions at protease-sensitive sites, achieving enhanced stability as demonstrated in our recent study (bioRxiv 2025). This automated platform overcomes long-standing barriers in azapeptide chemistry, providing a scalable route for the rapid generation of stabilized peptide therapeutics.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has proven effective in aquatic systems but remains underexplored for terrestrial habitats, partly due to point-source sampling bias and difficulty in upscaling. Air has emerged as a promising substrate yet most studies use active samplers which tend to be expensive, bulky, and require power. We used a newly developed, inexpensive, reusable, and easy-to-use passive airborne eDNA sampler (Nutshell eDNA sampler) to capture eDNA suspended in air across time (6 to 96 hours) within Rotterdam Zoo, the Netherlands. Its performance was compared to two commonly-used active airborne eDNA samplers for vertebrate diversity detection. In total, 88 species were detected, including 24 zoo residents. The Nutshell eDNA sampler was the most effective at detecting zoo residents, surpassing active samplers in species richness within 48 hours and continuing to accumulate new species beyond 96 hours, including detections of both patchy and singleton signals. It also detected the furthest species signal (515 m). Zoo airborne eDNA further demonstrated a positive correlation to species total biomass, suggesting larger vertebrates release proportionately more DNA into the air. Our findings indicate that for long, un-supervised biomonitoring, passive airborne eDNA sampling presents a promising approach for assessing vertebrate communities and putatively reduces detection noise in stochastic air eDNA signals. While deeper investigations into airborne eDNA sampling strategies are needed, passive methods can offer a much needed logistically flexible, low-maintenance approach compared to short-burst collection strategies employed by many active samplers.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Our findings reveal that DUBs OTUD6A and UCHL5 counteract degradation of AURKA by small molecule PROTACs. Further investigation using orthogonal dTAG PROTACs indicates that the PROTAC-opposing effect of OTUD6A is target-specific for AURKA, while UCHL5 counteracts degradation triggered by other PROTACs dependent on ubiquitin ligase adaptor CRBN, but not VHL. Furthermore, we show that differential sensitivity of the nuclear pool of AURKA to PROTAC-mediated degradation is fully explained by the specific subcellular localisation pattern of OTUD6A.

Previous work has established a critical role for the cellular vesicular trafficking protein, Rab11A, in transporting the viral genome segments to the site of budding at the plasma membrane. While the role of Rab11A in IAV assembly is relatively well understood, very little is known about the function of a closely related isoform (Rab11B) during influenza virus infection. We have shown that both Rab11A and Rab11B are required for successful IAV infection by current H1N1 or H3N2 isolates. Cells in which either Rab11A or Rab11B were depleted failed to efficiently produce virus, with significant reductions in infectious titer. Surprisingly, our data revealed that recent (2022) H3N2, but not H1N1, isolates failed to efficiently produce viral proteins in single-cycle infections when Rab11B (but not Rab11A) was depleted. Flow cytometry analysis suggests that the defect in protein production is driven by a reduction in the total number of infected cells, rather than a decrease in viral protein production at the single cell level. Using reverse genetics and 7+1 reassortant viruses we mapped this Rab11B-dependent early defect in recent H3N2 isolates to the HA gene. RT-qPCR analysis of H3N2 virions bound to the cell surface showed a ~50% decrease in virus binding the surface of cells depleted of Rab11B, but not Rab11A. This data suggests a novel role for Rab11B during viral entry, likely at the stage of viral binding, that is specific to H3N2 isolates.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

While these analyses often rely on phylogenetic trees, increasing evidence suggests that non-treelike evolutionary events, such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer, are prevalent in the evolutionary histories of many species, and in such cases, tree-based models are insufficient. Phylogenetic networks can capture such complex evolutionary histories, but current methods for accurately inferring them lack scalability. For instance, state-of-the-art model-based approaches are limited to around 30 taxa. Implicit network inference methods like NeighborNet and Consensus Networks are fast but lack biological interpretability. Here, we introduce a novel method called InPhyNet that merges a set of non-overlapping, independently inferred networks into a unified topology, achieving linear scalability while maintaining high accuracy under the multispecies network coalescent model. Our simulations show that InPhyNet matches the accuracy of SNaQ on datasets with 30 taxa while drastically decreasing the overall network inference time. InPhyNet is also more accurate than implicit network methods on large datasets while maintaining computational feasibility. Re-analyzing a phylogeny of 1,158 land plants with InPhyNet, we recover known reticulate events and provide evidence for the controversial placement of Order Gnetales within gymnosperms.

In this study, we used a preclinical mouse model that recapitulates cardiometabolic HFpEF to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving cardiac dysfunction, and tested whether recombinant Adropin (a liver- and brain-derived endogenous peptide hormone) could reverse observed defects. We show that long-term treatment with Adropin reversed multiple markers of HFpEF-related cardiac dysfunction (including fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy). Using untargeted metabolomics, we found that Adropin treatment reduced hexosamine biosynthesis pathway activity, leading to a reduction in the O-GlcNAcylation of the cardiac fatty acid oxidation enzyme long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD). Reducing LCAD O-GlcNAcylation increased LCAD activity in vitro, and reduced the accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines in HFpEF mouse hearts in vivo.

Here, we present a comprehensive methodological framework that formally synthesizes forensic DNA evidence (FDE) with SE through innovative Markov chain models and customized transition matrices designed for various biological traits. This approach generates combined likelihood assessments expressed as LRs or posterior probabilities.

MGEs themselves may also carry immune systems, such as CRISPR-Cas, to target competitor MGEs. It is unclear when this is favoured by natural selection, and whether toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems - common competitive mechanisms carried by plasmids - can alter their efficacy. Here, we develop and test novel theory to analyse the outcome of competition between plasmids when one carries a CRISPR-Cas system that targets the other plasmid. Our model and experiments reveal that plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas is beneficial to the plasmid carrying it when the plasmid has not recently transferred to a new host. However, CRISPR-Cas is selected against when the plasmid carrying it transfers horizontally, if a resident competitor plasmid encodes a TA system that elicits post-segregational killing. Consistent with a TA barrier to plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas, a bioinformatic analysis reveals that naturally occurring CRISPR-Cas-bearing plasmids avoid targeting other plasmids with TA systems. Our work shows how the benefit of plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas is severely reduced against TA-encoding competitor plasmids, but only when plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas is horizontally transferred. These findings have key implications for the distribution of prokaryotic defences and our understanding of their role in competition between MGEs, and the utility of CRISPR-Cas as a tool to remove plasmids from pathogenic bacteria.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Among these, the core protein (HCC) forms the capsid via organised multimerization, thereby guiding viral assembly. This process depends on the dynamic localisation of HCC between the endoplasmic reticulum bilayer membrane and the lipid droplet monolayer. While past studies have examined the role of some HCC structural properties and other viral and host proteins in the assembly process, the contribution of lipid molecules was not thoroughly investigated yet. Since specific lipids are upregulated during HCV infection, it is reasonable that these molecules might play an important role for virus fitness and infection progression. In this study, we have addressed this topic and, specifically, how HCC-lipid interactions might impact HCC-HCC interactions. Using in vitro models and quantitative fluorescence microscopy techniques, we investigated HCC binding affinity to lipid membranes, multimerization and lateral diffusivity. Our results reveal the effect of HCC interactions with anionic phospholipids (PLs) on the binding to monolayers and bilayers. Furthermore, our analysis shows that PI(4)P enhances HCC multimerization and, therefore, might drive lateral assembly for capsid formation.

Population variation in stress tolerance at the local scale was comparable to that across latitude. Consistent with local adaptation, populations from warmer and drier environments showed greater heat and desiccation tolerance, and populations from more predictable environments showed greater plasticity.

We fitted a series of incrementally complex spatial models for point patterns in one and two dimensions to examine how the habitat associations and spatial arrangement of Pheidole bergi colonies change among scenarios of natural and anthropogenic variations in environmental conditions in the central Monte desert. At the habitat scale, P. bergi preferred the protected open woodland (algarrobal), with strong and persistent density variations at scales of tens of meters along most dirt roads crossing it. The 40% reduction in active colonies during the 2019 - 2025 drought was inversely density-dependent, increasing aggregation. Instead, colonies were 40 - 50% lower but more homogeneously arranged on roads crossing habitats with extensive natural or anthropic limiting factors (sand dunes and livestock-grazed algarrobal). Colony density within the protected algarrobal also showed >50% reduction between the wet 2001 and the dry 2019, with their distribution always influenced by the two-phase mosaic structure typical of arid lands. This preference for inter-patch borders and open areas rather than the interior of woody vegetated patches probably explains why the intensive anthropic impacts associated with dirt roads had no notable effect on P. bergi density. Beyond that spatial dependence, significative distance-related pairwise interactions between colonies shifted from slightly attractive in 2001, resulting in clumped distributions, towards strongly repulsive by 2019, favoring more random and overdispersed spatial patterns, contrary to the expected correlation between intraspecific competition and colony density. Pheidole bergi seems flexible enough to establish colonies in different habitats and microhabitats although with distribution and population dynamics still shaped by natural and anthropic, direct and indirect environmental constraints such as soil texture, vegetation cover or resource availability affected by multi-year droughts. The inversed density-dependent thinning and shifting relevance of inter-colony interactions with climate fluctuations observed at different spatial scales highlight the complex interplay between environmental constraints and intraspecific dynamics in the population ecology of P. bergi, an abundant, omnivorous, aggresive and probably ecologically relevant ant species in the Monte desert.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

The model relies solely on the free-energy gradient driving strand growth and requires asymmetric cooperativity - a kinetic asymmetry known to promote unidirectional elongation. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that this minimal model facilitates kinetic discrimination between correct and incorrect base pair incorporations, and for specific set of parameters, reproduces the error ratio of ~10^{-4}, experimentally observed in passive base selection processes. It replicates key features observed in DNA error correction, including stalling, fraying, next-nucleotide effects, and the speed-accuracy trade-off. Our results provide plausible answers for longstanding questions, such as the energy source for the enhanced base selectivity of passive DNA polymerases and the role of thermodynamics and kinetics of phosphodiester bond formation in error correction. We show that catalysis of the phosphodiester bond plays a central role in error correction, even without explicit enzymatic structural discrimination.

Genetic accommodation allows plastic phenotypes to be tuned to new environments and eventually to even be lost. The colourful and toxic Heliconiini butterflies have biochemical plasticity: they either sequester their cyanogenic glucosides (CG) from their larval hostplant or biosynthesize them when compounds for sequestration are not available. Here, we trace the evolution of CG biosynthesis in Heliconiini butterflies, a fundamental component of this biochemical plasticity. We first reconstructed the evolutionary history of biochemical plasticity in Heliconiini butterflies using chemical data from over 700 individuals, demonstrating that plasticity was ancestral in the tribe and further lost in a few clades, such as the Sapho clade that only sequester CGs. In lepidopterans, CG biosynthesis has been fully characterized in the moth Zygaena filipendulae, and is composed of CYP405A2, CYP332A3, and UGT33A1. Thus, we CRISPR-edited the gene CYP405 in Heliconius erato, and confirmed that CYP405-knockout caterpillars do not biosynthesize CGs. We identified the CYP405s and CYP332s in other lepidopterans and found that both genes were independently co-opted into CG biosynthesis in the Heliconiinae butterflies and Zygaena moths. Most lepidopterans have a CYP332, but CYP405 is mostly restricted to butterflies and has been duplicated in all Heliconius species. Although several CYP405 copies were found in the Sapho clade, they lack structurally important P450 domains, which explain they loss of biochemical plasticity via specialization in CG sequestration. Our findings represent one of the few examples of plasticity-first evolution in which the genetic mechanisms associated with its accommodation/assimilation are known.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Each of these tools, focuses on a part of the process from raw data to single neuron activity. For example, SpikeInterface is an incredibly useful Python module for pre-processing and spike sorting of individual recordings. However, there are more steps in between raw data and spikes, such as synchronization of spike times between probes and histological reconstruction of probe insertions. Therefore, we developed Power Pixels, combining the functionality of several packages into one integrated pipeline, which may be run in any lab workflow. It includes pre-processing, spike sorting, neuron-level quality control metrics, synchronization between multiple probes, compression of raw data, and ephys-to-histology alignment. Integrating all these steps into one pipeline greatly simplifies Neuropixels data processing, especially for novel users who might struggle to find their way around all the available code and tools.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Prior work shows that the body and technology are represented simultaneously, but little is known about how these representations evolve dynamically across different sensorimotor interaction phases. To fill this gap, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built exoskeletal device that extended users' fingers by 10 cm. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after exoskeleton wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task to measure representations of biological and exoskeletal fingers. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, wearing the exoskeleton led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, after active use, the represented lengths of the biological and exoskeletal fingers stretched significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a post-removal aftereffect on the biological finger representation was observed. These results demonstrate that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into body representations, with dynamic proprioceptive adjustments shaped by structural and functional properties of the device. This work advances our understanding of how the sensorimotor system accommodates artificial extensions and highlights the potential for body-augmenting technologies to be intuitively integrated within the sensorimotor system.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Litterbags were deployed in a reciprocal transplant design within each experiment, where we measured litter mass loss, chemistry, moisture content, and decomposer communities. Litter placed in droughted plots decomposed slower than in control plots and experimental litter derived from elevated CO2 plots decomposed slower over the first three harvests compared to control litter. Under drought, litter mass loss and C:N changes were regulated by initial litter properties and the decomposition environment, while elevated CO2 acted via changes to initial litter properties.

These are removed by a non-canonical splicing pathway in which the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex catalyzes intron excision and the resulting exons are subsequently ligated by the tRNA-ligase complex (tRNA-LC). Although recent studies have provided insights into the process of intron removal, the molecular mechanisms underpinning tRNA ligation by tRNA-LC remain elusive. The tRNA-LC is a hetero-pentameric protein assembly consisting of Ashwin, CGI-99, FAM98B, the DEAD-box helicase DDX1 and the catalytic subunit RTCB/HSPC117. Using cryo-EM, we have determined an atomic-resolution reconstruction of human tRNA-LC. We find that CGI-99, DDX1 and FAM98B form an alpha-helical bundle that contacts RTCB via an interface located on the opposite side from the location of the ligase active site and tethers DDX1 to the tRNA-LC via its C-terminal helix. FAM98B and CGI-99 extensively interact in an intricately co-folded heterodimer that clamps Ashwin in a pincer-like structure. Interaction analysis using structure-based mutants of tRNA-LC subunits supports the overall architecture of the complex. Finally, we show that the paralogous proteins FAM98A and FAM98C underpin the assembly of compositionally distinct RTCB-containing complexes that lack Ashwin and may have distinct cellular functions.

Here we examined the evolutionary history of IncP-1 plasmids by utilizing the large increase in published genomes and advancing techniques for lineage-based detection of microbial recombination. We specifically tested whether IncP-1 backbone genes evolve primarily (1) through vertical transmission, or (2) horizontally through homologous recombination between distinct plasmids. Our key finding is the IncP-1 plasmid backbone evolves predominantly through vertical transmission, which was supported by a nucleotide-level mapping of backbone recombination. We also showed via a phylogeny of 187 IncP-1 plasmids that established subgroup categories are well-supported. Finally, we examined factors that are potentially associated with IncP-1 subgroup diversification, including a gene related to plasmid-host adaptation and accessory genes like antibiotic and resistance metals.

Recent cryo EM structures revealing conformational changes in the rotor stator complex during directional switching suggested to us a mechanism by which YcgR acts. We call this the Texas 2 Step model, after the country dance in which partners move smoothly in a CCW arc with quick steps followed by slow ones. In this model, YcgR first binds a MotA subunit when the rotor adopts the CCW conformation, in which stators are largely displaced from the C ring.

The GT70 family contains a single well-characterized enzyme, GumK, a glucuronosyltransferase from Xanthomonas campestris required for xanthan gum biosynthesis. Here, we applied multiscale molecular simulations and sequence analysis to probe GumK dynamics and substrate specificity. We show that GumK undergoes twisting and bending motions constrained by interdomain contacts and modulated by membrane anchoring. Acceptor-substrate binding within an amphiphilic clamp promotes opening, whereas donor-substrate binding stabilizes closure, defining a substrate-dependent catalytic cycle. Specificity for UDP-glucuronate is mediated by a conserved electrostatic environment centered on Lys307 and a hydrophobic triad that orients the sugar moiety. On the acceptor side, the binding site selectively accommodates polyisoprenyl carriers up to three isoprene units in length and wraps around the substrate, constraining the trisaccharide moiety in a catalytically competent conformation. Comparative analysis highlights GumK-specific motifs that distinguish it from homologous GTs.

Initially, numerical softening factors were implemented, allowing greater overlap between particles to expedite computations, with an optimal value of 0.03 selected. Adhesion forces between RBCs and the channel wall were incorporated, with a minimum effective distance of 0.4 um identified as computationally feasible. However, inter-RBC adhesion led to artificial clustering and was therefore omitted. Coarse-graining methods were applied up to a factor of 2 to further reduce simulation time, with a value of 1.8 chosen based on consistent cell-free layer (CFL) thickness and drag force characteristics. To correct for the increased drag in coarse-grained models, rolling resistance (Type C) with a coefficient of 0.8 was employed, bringing deviations within 10%. The validated model was then extended to simulate the detachment of adherent C2C12 myoblasts under physiological flow. Experimental validation showed increasing cell retention with seeding time, and simulations reproduced this trend with <5% deviation.

PALM is trained on the WaltzDB-2.0 dataset to classify peptides and identify aggregation-prone regions within a sequence at single-residue resolution.

Neuroimaging studies have implicated cortical midline structures and the default mode network (DMN) associated with self-related processing, but replication across sites and larger samples is needed. Methods: We examined neural correlates of self- versus other-agency judgments in two independent cohorts of first-episode schizophrenia patients (n = 177) and controls (n = 123) recruited at separate MRI centers. During fMRI, participants performed an agency-related task. Data were analyzed using independent component analysis and statistical parametric mapping, focusing on networks associated with self-referential processing. Results: Across both sites, self-agency consistently engaged the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus, key regions of the DMN. Schizophrenia patients exhibited significantly reduced DMN activation during self-referential processing compared to controls. While site-related differences were noted in the magnitude of activation, the core pattern of DMN disruption was robust across analytic approaches and datasets. Conclusions: This study replicates and extends prior findings of altered self-agency processing in schizophrenia, demonstrating consistent DMN hypo-activation in first-episode patients across two independent cohorts. These results validate the agency paradigm as a reliable probe of self-related neural mechanisms and support models of schizophrenia as a disorder of altered self-perception.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

There is no convincing evidence that APC directs the degradation of other substrates. Using a reconstituted cytosolic extract-based system and complementary in vivo and cellular assays, we show that SREBP2, the master regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis, is a direct APC-AXIN1 substrate. APC-dependent SREBP2 degradation is conserved in Xenopus embryos, mouse colon, and human colorectal cancer cells and restricts SREBP2 target-gene expression, cholesterol synthesis, and tissue cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, APC and AXIN1 promote SREBP2 degradation via a conserved phosphodegron, which marks SREBP2 for ubiquitination by the E3 enzyme, FBXW7. Like {beta}-catenin, SREBP2 is stabilized by extracellular Wnt ligands; unlike {beta}-catenin, its regulation is independent of GSK3{beta} and CK1 and requires the entire APC mutational cluster region (MCR), whereas {beta}-catenin turnover can operate with only a partial MCR. These findings define a {beta}-catenin-independent branch of Wnt signaling that couples APC to sterol metabolism, providing a mechanistic rationale to target the mevalonate/SREBP2 axis in APC-mutant colorectal cancer.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we experimentally separated the effects of male-male competition and female mate choice in the pygmy halfbeak Dermogenys colletei, a small freshwater fish, to test whether i) male social dominance drives access to females in the presence and absence of direct male-male competition, and ii) females prefer socially dominant males. Our results show that dominant males monopolized access to females, spending more time courting females and engaging in more courtship behaviors. Additionally, female halfbeaks did not show a preference for dominant males, providing no evidence that females use male dominance when assessing males. Overall, these findings highlight that when male-male competition facilitates mate monopolization there may be less scope for pre-copulatory female mate choice.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Through lipidomic profiling of Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that Syn progressively alters lipid metabolism in aging worms. Syn strongly reduces overall content of triacylglycerols (TAG) and disrupts the structure of lipid droplets (LD). These pathological changes depend on Syn's properties to condensate and form inclusions. Apart from lowering TAG levels, Syn also increases the proportion of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFAs). Consequently, genetic inhibition of LCUFA biosynthesis alleviates Syn-induced loss of C. elegans motility. Strikingly, bypassing lipid metabolic defects by supplementing Medium Chain Fatty Acids (MCFAs) restores the Syn-impaired mitochondrial response and rescues motility. These results link Syn condensation to impaired TAG metabolism, which reduces mitochondrial function and enhances overall toxicity. Together with the finding that plasma TAGs are lowered in Parkinson patient cohorts, these results suggest that restoring TAG metabolism could alleviate Syn-induced toxicity in Parkinson's and other age-related synucleinopathies.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Using 27 haplotype-resolved genomes from wild and domesticated apples (Malus spp.), we dissected the structure and evolution of the S-locus. We identified 17 S-RNase alleles and 500 pollen-expressed S-locus F-box brother (SFBB) genes across 18 families. The S-locus exhibits hallmark features of a supergene, including suppressed recombination, TE accumulation, and an excess of non-synonymous polymorphisms. Nonetheless, long-term balancing selection preserves both the integrity and diversity of entire S-haplotypes. Recurrent associations between SFBB families and transposable elements, coupled with gene conversion signatures, suggest a dynamic mechanism for reshuffling recognition specificities. Our results provide a detailed view of how a multigenic, tightly linked recognition system is maintained in a woody perennial, and highlight the interplay between structural constraints and selection in sustaining functional diversity and reproductive barriers.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

TEs can also move between species through unknown intermediaries in a process known as horizontal transfer, infecting novel genomes and increasing in copy number. While many individual invasions have been documented, a large dataset of recent horizontal transfer events that will allow us to understand larger more general HT patterns has not been assembled. In this manuscript we used almost 400 dipteran genomes to uncover 637 recent transposon invasions, mostly in Drosophila. The majority of transfers occurred between closely related species, with the cosmopolitan melanogaster group showing the highest recent transfer activity. We even documented a single transposon with 16 recent transfers, many between different Drosophila groups. Using species distance on a phylogenetic tree to measure the distance that transposons travel, we found that DNA transposons transfer between distantly related species much more frequently compared to retrotransposons. This potentially represents a different evolutionary strategy for exploiting naive genomes. Our phylogenetic framework advances the understanding of horizontal transfer dynamics at the species level within Drosophila.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

We introduce Nona, a multimodal masked modeling framework that unifies these paradigms by learning jointly from DNA sequence and base-resolution functional genomics data. Beyond unifying existing modeling paradigms, Nona enables entirely new modeling objectives. We demonstrate its versatility through three applications: (1) a context-aware sequence-to-function model that improves local predictions by up to 13% by correcting systematic errors in sequence-to-function predictions; (2) a functional language model that integrates functional data into language modeling, learns relevant regulatory sequence motifs, and enables regulatory element design through masked discrete diffusion; (3) functional genotyping, which reveals an unrecognized privacy vulnerability in processed ATAC-seq data and re-identifies individuals from genetic databases with perfect accuracy.

We tested whether sleep stage transitions exhibit these distinct patterns using quantitative EEG analysis. Methods: We analyzed 622 sleep stage transitions from 12 healthy adults (Wake[-&gt;]N1, N1[-&gt;]N2, N2[-&gt;]N3, REM[-&gt;]Wake) using the Consciousness Gradient Index (CGI = {surd}({varphi} * {rho}) * 10). We employed two approaches: (1) an adaptive method selecting transition-specific metrics (alpha power, spindle density, spectral entropy), and (2) control analyses applying uniform metrics (spectral entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity) across all transitions. Results: The adaptive approach showed N1[-&gt;]N2 as the steepest transition (slope = -2.161, d = 2.814, p < 0.001). However, control analyses revealed this pattern to be metric-dependent. With spectral entropy applied uniformly, all transitions showed near-zero slopes (0.001-0.004), with N1[-&gt;]N2 ranking 3rd in magnitude. With Lempel-Ziv complexity, N1[-&gt;]N2 showed the smallest magnitude (0.001). Neither control supported N1[-&gt;]N2 as uniquely steep. Conclusions: The apparent \"dual architecture\" resulted from selecting metrics based on known neurophysiological changes at each transition, creating circular reasoning. Control analyses using unbiased metrics showed no meaningful consciousness changes during any transition. This study demonstrates the importance of validation with uniformly-applied metrics and serves as a methodological warning about metric selection effects in consciousness research. The adaptive CGI framework successfully detected known neurophysiological changes but did not reveal fundamental differences in consciousness transition mechanisms.

C.", "abstract": "Ovarian follicles in some species develop in subgroups known as \"waves.\" Mouse fetal ovaries generate wave 2 follicles that form an ovarian reserve and wave 1.5 follicles that support early fertility. Wave 1 mouse follicles undergo atresia in juvenile animals that amplifies thecal cells and androgen production during puberty. We identified three similar follicle waves in Drosophila by tracking >6,000 individual lineage-labeled clones from individual germline or somatic cells in developing pupal ovaries. 40 of [~]100 larval primordial germ cells (PGCs) associate with forming germline stem cell (GSC) niches. After a delay of >30 hours during early pupal stages, GSCs begin division and ultimately produce cysts that ensure a lifetime supply of wave 2 eggs. Wave 1.5 follicles develop directly from many of the remaining PGCs to g enerate [~]20 cysts and all 80 ovarian follicles present at adult eclosion. Adult-like but unstable follicle stem cells (FSCs) generate most follicle cells for wave 1.5, with a contribution from the basal stalk. Unexpectedly, a true wave 1 subpopulation arises from relatively few posterior PGCs. Drosophila wave 1 germ cells increase rapidly to 250-350 cells by dividing and then forming germline cysts. They subsequently interact with somatic swarm cells before undergoing an atresia-like process and exiting the ovary. Our results argue that production of specific ovarian follicle waves, including an initial wave that undergoes atresia during adult tissue development, has been conserved during evolution.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEHere we show that Drosophila oogenesis takes place in three follicle waves matching the follicle waves recently described in mice. Previously, ovaries were thought to generate one follicle type dedicated to reproduction and follicles undergoing atresia were considered defective. By better documenting pupal ovary development at single-cell resolution, we demonstrate that each wave derives from distinct PGCs and interacts with different somatic cells. The previously unknown Drosophila wave 1 follicles, amplify rapidly from [~]10 to 300 germ cells, break from the ovary and release their contents into the hemolymph coincident with the pupal ecdysone peak. Follicle wave conservation argues that ovaries produce multiple germ cell types that evolved for distinct roles, including the promotion of adult development.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

We investigated the molecular effects of RT on the immune landscape of NPC and identified a key role of the STING-ATM-MPO axis in RT-induced immune suppression, which is associated with regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion and radioresistance.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed leukocyte counts from 653 NPC patients before treatment and at multiple time points (week 1-2, week 3-4, and week 5-6) after RT. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from stage I NPC patients (T1N0M0) treated with RT alone. Blood samples were collected before and after 18 Gy RT (in 2 Gy fractions). A randomized six-arm syngeneic mouse tumor model and in vitro cell studies were used to investigate interactions among STING-ATM signaling, immune modulation, and tumor response.\n\nResultsIn NPC patients, RT suppressed cGAS-STING signaling in monocytes and dendritic cells but promoted immunosuppressive programs, including PD-1 signaling, checkpoint expression, regulatory T cell expansion, and upregulation of TGF{beta}1, IL-10, VEGF, PDGF, and MDSC-associated pathways. In a syngeneic mouse model, co-treatment with the STING agonist diABZI reversed these effects and improved tumor control. Bulk RNA sequencing confirmed that RT suppressed cGAS-STING and ATM signaling in both spleens and tumors. Combination treatment restored this signaling, enhanced neutrophil degranulation, and inhibited PD-1 signaling and immune checkpoints. Immunohistochemistry showed that diABZI increased ATM activation, MPO expression, and reduced Treg infiltration in spleens and tumors. ATM activation correlated positively with MPO and inversely with FOXP3 immunoreactivity, suggesting that STING-ATM-MPO activation counteracts Treg-mediated immune suppression. In vitro, diABZI activated STING-ATM signaling in PBMCs, THP-1 cells, and Jurkat T cells, while inhibiting NPC cell growth partly via CYLD upregulation.\n\nConclusionsThese findings link RT-induced suppression to inhibition of cGAS-STING signaling.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its ligands (primarily 1,25(OH)2D3) have a recognized role in calcium homeostasis; however, their broader impact on female reproduction remains underexplored. We demonstrate that the VDR and its ligands are involved in the hormonal induction of uterine decidualization. Mice fed a vitamin D-deficient diet displayed an impaired hormonally induced decidual response. In a human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized human endometrial stromal cell line (T-HESC), VDR decreased during in vitro decidualization. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of VDR in T-HESC enhanced in vitro decidualization, while overexpression of VDR inhibited it. Chromatin accessibility and histone modification analyses revealed that VDR functions as a chromatin regulator, restricting accessibility and repressing transcription in specific genomic regions. Transcriptomic analyses confirmed that VDR broadly modulates gene expression, with most ligand-mediated effects occurring through the VDR. These findings identify VDR as a key regulator of transcriptional and chromatin landscapes in human endometrial stromal cells, offering novel insights into vitamin D signaling in reproduction. This study highlights the potential of targeting vitamin D pathways to treat uterine disorders associated with impaired decidualization and reduced fertility.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Dual-stream topology - functionally distinct visuomotor and perceptual pathways - emerged spontaneously with rich cross-communication. Shapley value analyses revealed that action- and perception-selective features developed progressively across depth, reflecting task-driven hierarchical specialization. Time-resolved EEG showed that model activity mapped onto dissociable temporal components in human cortex: ventral-aligned signals emerged early and late, where dorsal- and ventral-aligned responses coincided in the intervening interval.

An overlooked aspect of expanding human population-level drug exposure is the downstream impact of ingested drug on the mosquito vector. Data suggest both infected and uninfected Anopheles mosquitoes refeed often with [&ge;]4 blood meals during their lifespan. This provides repeated opportunities for mosquitoes to ingest drug via bloodmeals taken from people with antimalarials in the bloodstream and raises questions as to whether exposure may impact the mosquito itself, and/or parasites developing within the infected mosquito. We investigated the impact of exposure to physiologic levels of commonly used long-acting human antimalarials in the Anopheles mosquito via drug-spiked blood feeds. We did not observe any significant differences in mosquito feeding, behavior, fertility, or viability after ingestion of amodiaquine, desethylamodiaquine, piperaquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in either lab-reared An. gambiae or field-derived An. coluzzii mosquitoes. Interrogating drug distribution within mosquitoes utilizing LC-MS/MS, desethylamodiaquine, the longer-acting active metabolite of amodiaquine, was fed at 2 concentrations (1/2X and 2X Cmax) with drug subsequently detected in a dose-dependent manner in pooled whole mosquitoes, midguts and hemolymph. This was significant for whole mosquitoes harvested at 24hrs and 120hrs, and midguts harvested at 24hrs. Between 24 to 120 hrs, drug decreased in midguts but increased in hemolymph.

White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), the largest freshwater fish in North America, have experienced at least two rounds of whole genome duplication, and may exhibit both di- and multi-valent meiotic segregation. Moreover, they exhibit contemporary ploidy variants due to spontaneous autopolyploidy, particularly in aquaculture. Nonetheless, as a species with several population segments that exhibit chronic recruitment failure, conservation aquaculture is an important part of their management. To facilitate the development of genetic tools to aid white sturgeon conservation, as well as a basis to understand how ploidy changes and variation historically and contemporarily shape the evolution of this species, we present a genome assembly for a white sturgeon from the Snake River, Idaho, USA. Analysis of sequence data used for assembly indicated a haploid genome size of approximately 1.5Gbp, implying tetraploidy (4N), while analysis of heterozygous k-mers from 21 to 41 bp suggest the genome reflects both 4N and 8N variants. The final genome assembly, scaffolded using linkage maps constructed from Fraser River and Snake River F1 families, contained 6.26Gbp in 832,145 scaffolds, consistent with published genome size estimates. Conserved ortholog completeness for this genome (90.5%; 22.8% single-copy and 67.7% duplicated) was similar to the putatively diploid sterlet sturgeon, and the largest linkage map-based scaffold was 55.2Gbp, though the N50 for this assembly was only 416Kbp, indicating the assembly remains fragmented. We demonstrate the utility of this assembly by identifying genomic regions significantly associated with sex. Genetic markers, designed for inclusion in an amplicon genotyping panel, predicted sex 96.6% and 81.5% correctly in females and males, respectively, providing a strong overall association (?82 p-value < 2.7x10-37) with some variation by geographic region.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

D.; Jegou, A.; Romet-Lemonne, G.; Leduc, C.", "abstract": "Vimentin intermediate filaments play essential roles in maintaining cell integrity and regulating numerous cellular functions. In particular, vimentin cooperates with the actin cytoskeleton in key cellular processes that rely on actin dynamics, such as such as migration, division, and mechanosensing. While there is evidence that these two cytoskeletal components interact in cells, the underlying molecular mechanisms are only partially understood. Actin and vimentin can interact through biochemical signaling pathways or via cross-linkers, but whether they engage in a direct protein-protein interaction has remained controversial, in part because such interactions are difficult to isolate and characterize in cells. Using in vitro reconstitution and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to monitor the elongation of single actin filaments, we show that vimentin promotes actin elongation at the barbed end in a dose-dependent manner. Neither the vimentin tail nor head domains are required for this effect, and both filamentous and non-filamentous vimentin enhance actin elongation. We find that this acceleration results from a stabilization of actin subunits at the barbed end. Strikingly, this effect depends on the nucleotide state of actin, as the acceleration is only observed for the elongation from ATP-actin, and not ADP-actin monomers. This stabilization also enables vimentin to promote the nucleation of actin filaments. Consistently, magnetic pull-down assays demonstrate a direct, albeit weak, interaction between vimentin and actin monomers. Altogether, these findings identify vimentin as an unexpected new actor in the regulation of actin dynamics at the barbed end and bring new insights into the functional role of vimentin through cytoskeletal crosstalk.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

We therefore hypothesised that MNP exposure might interact with PD risk mutations affecting mitochondrial fidelity. We used a fruit fly model of PRKN-dependent PD associated with defects in mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control pathway, to test this hypothesis. We found that ingestion of MNPs at concentrations tolerated by wild-type controls selectively enhanced PD-relevant phenotypes - including progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration, movement defects, and sleep disruption - in this model of PD.

Pre-Omicron strains broadly suppressed antiviral interferon-stimulated gene expression and reprogrammed metabolism by reducing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and {beta}-oxidation. Delta infection was associated with extensive transcriptional and metabolic remodelling, characterised by activation of stress- and growth-related kinases and selective retention of biosynthetic amino acids, consistent with a host response to stress and viral modulation of interferon-associated signalling.

Two other families of insecticidal proteins, Prb proteins from bacterial symbionts of entomopathogenic nematodes and a marine bacterial pathogen, and IPD113 proteins from ferns, are two-domain (2D) proteins structurally resembling domains I and II of Cry proteins. Despite the structural resemblance, the amino acid sequence identity among these families is only ~10%, supporting the prevailing view that they evolved independently through convergent evolution. However, the possibility of remote homology and ancient horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present evidence supporting divergent evolution of these protein families. We found that proteins containing Cry-like two domains are distributed far more broadly across bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea than previously recognized. Phylogenetic analyses separated the structurally similar proteins into five clades including Cry, IPD113, Prb, and 2D/3D-mixed clades. Domain-level trees revealed intermixing within domain II, with nematocidal Cry proteins frequently clustering with IPD113 and 2D/3D-mixed clades, suggesting domain swapping events across these clades. Conserved amino acid motifs and domain core structures across clades further support a shared evolutionary origin. Phylogenetic and structural analyses suggest a bacterial origin of the fern IPD113 gene and its horizontal transfer via fungal symbionts, as well as multiple HGT events into diverse terrestrial and marine eukaryotes and archaea.

RA treatment during development increased the proportion of extrastriolar and intermediate-type hair cells, indicating that increased RA reduces striolar development. However, in fish with mechanotransduction dysfunction from a cadherin23 mutation, normal RA patterning is insufficient to finalize the fate of early-born hair cells, which remain transcriptomically unresolved. RA treatment further exacerbates this abnormal patterning. We conclude that hair cell fate, and thus normal zonal patterning, depends on both hair cell activity and the RA gradient.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework outlines an ambitious pathway to achieve harmony with nature by 2050, with 23 targets for 2030. Among them, Target 6 seeks to reduce invasive alien species (IAS) introductions by 50% and minimize their impacts. Achieving and monitoring progress towards this target is highly challenging, as observed first records rarely reflect true introduction rates due to detection lags influenced by survey effort, detectability, and taxonomic expertise. To address this, statistical methods, such as the approach proposed by Solow and Costello (2004), account for detection delays and provide a more reliable basis for estimating IAS establishment rates. This forms the basis of Headline Indicator 6.1 within a wider suite of component and complementary indicators that together describe invasion dynamics and impacts. Reliable monitoring requires transparent, reproducible tools that can integrate diverse data sources. Here, we present b3alien, a software package developed to facilitate calculation of Target 6 indicators. Built on the biodiversity data cube framework from the Biodiversity Building Blocks for Policy (B-Cubed) project, b3alien leverages the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) infrastructure, including its Taxonomic Backbone and the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS). By integrating GBIF occurrence records with checklists and complementary datasets, the tool enables robust estimation of IAS establishment rates while supporting additional invasion-related indicators. Outputs are technically rigorous yet accessible, ensuring usability for policymakers and stakeholders. The basic workflow is using a GBIF-based occurrence cube, which can be extended by incorporating citizen science contributions, private datasets, and customized checklists, thereby ensuring flexibility and adaptability across contexts. By aligning with FAIR data principles, b3alien ensures indicators are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Importantly, the approach empowers countries to build their own indicators on open, community-driven infrastructures, lowering technical and financial barriers, fostering bottom-up ownership, and ensuring scientific and policy credibility. In summary, b3alien demonstrates how open infrastructures, standardized data, and reproducible workflows can make IAS monitoring both accessible and scientifically robust. By bridging biodiversity data with actionable policy insights, it provides a practical and equitable pathway to support the ambitions of the Global Biodiversity Framework Target 6.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

H.; Hafner, M.", "abstract": "PAR-CLIP is a widely used method for identifying binding sites of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) transcriptome-wide. A characteristic T-to-C transition in the sequenced cDNA pinpoints the site of RBP-RNA crosslinking and is induced by the use of a photoreactive uridine analogue, 4-thiouridine (4SU). As with other systems-wide methods, PAR-CLIP, too, is prone to false discoveries as the T-to-C signal might result from systematic noise, pre-existing SNPs, and PCR errors. Therefore, rigorous statistical methods are required for analyzing PAR-CLIP data. The few existing tools to analyze PAR-CLIP data lack updates and sufficient documentation, and often fail to process current higher-depth sequencing data. Here we report PCLIPtools, a lightweight, customizable suite for analyzing PAR-CLIP data. PCLIPtools considers the read depth, T-to-C transitions, and the other mutations to statistically estimate high-confidence interaction sites. Benchmarking shows that PCLIPtools identifies more functionally significant targets than the current standard tool, PARalyzer, without losing high-confidence sites and outperforming it in runtime. Exploratory analyses show PCLIPtools' specific targets are enriched for read depth and T-to-C conversion, supporting their validity. With simplicity, robustness, and speed, PCLIPtools improves the precision of PAR-CLIP data analysis while being accessible to experimental RNA biologists.

We performed a comparative in silico analysis of two clinically relevant 5-HT1A agonists, buspirone and tandospirone, to examine their binding behavior and toxicity profiles. Molecular docking was run on the serotonin-bound HTR1A receptor (PDB ID: 7E2Y) using SwissDock, and toxicological predictions were generated with ProTox 3.0. Both ligands showed the greatest binding affinity for Chain A of the receptor (-6.14 kcal/mol for buspirone and -5.88 kcal/mol for tandospirone), suggesting a preferred receptor conformation that may mediate therapeutic efficacy. Buspirone demonstrated greater binding stability than tandospirone across models, while chains G and R showed weak or unstable interactions for both compounds. Predicted toxicity profiles indicated high probabilities of neurotoxicity and respiratory toxicity for both ligands, with blood-brain barrier penetration probabilities of 0.99 (buspirone) and 1.00 (tandospirone). Tandospirone also showed potential immunotoxic effects (probability 0.73). These findings underscore the importance of receptor conformation in 5-HT1A ligand binding and can inform structure-guided optimization to enhance efficacy while reducing CNS-related adverse effects.

The matrix was derived from a dataset of representative protein crystal structures and NMR structures selected from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The pairwise amino acid contacts separated by distance less than or equal to 3.2 Angstrom units in protein 3D structures was used to evaluate probabilities and propensities against background and the Boltzmann equation P(x) = e-(E(x)/KT) that links the probability of observing an event x with energy E(x) at a given temperature T was used to evaluate the BSE for proteins defined in Millielectron Volts (MeV) units. The BSE for a protein is obtained by summing up corresponding values for amino acid pairs from the matrix that satisfy the distance criterion in protein 3D structure. The landscape of BSE values for representative proteins based on propensities ranged between -890.99 MeV to 711.57 MeV among crystal structures and between -717.64 MeV to 234.78 MeV among NMR structures. Whereas, the landscape of BSE values based on probability alone was comparatively much narrower and ranged between 36.88 MeV to 131.28 MeV for the crystal structures and between 34.30 MeV to 102.23 MeV for the 871 NMR structures. Therefore, BSEs based on propensity with a broader range of values is suggested as being useful to discriminate individual proteins. The evaluation of BSE for proteins can be used to estimate relative gain or loss in energy between proteins that has applications in identifying low-energy conformations among an ensemble of protein conformations, or changes in energy due to drug/inhibitor/small molecule binding to the protein. The method was applied to evaluate changes in BSE for certain cancer drugs bound to protein targets and to analyse trends in predictions based on BSE with experimental observations on drug/inhibitor binding effectiveness as reported in literature.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Leaves are a key interface at which trees respond to abiotic stress, and foliar traits such as chemical defenses and microbial communities may play an important role in determining post-drought resilience. Here, we tested whether prior-year drought leaves a persistent imprint on leaf traits in Populus tremuloides. Using a three-year common garden experiment with controlled water limitation, we measured two major classes of defensive phenolics--salicinoid phenolic glycosides (SPGs) and condensed tannins (CTs)--alongside foliar fungal community composition. SPG concentrations increased and CTs declined in response to prior-year drought, with these effects persisting across growing seasons. While overall fungal community composition remained relatively stable, we detected shifts in the relative abundance of individual amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), particularly within potentially pathogenic lineages, associated with drought history. These findings provide evidence that drought leaves a legacy in leaf chemistry and microbial colonization, with potential consequences for how trees tolerate future abiotic and biotic stress. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating foliar trait legacies into models of forest resilience under climate change.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Mutations in distinct functional domains of p62 are linked with the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), underscoring its importance in neural cells. Neurons and astrocytes perform distinct roles in brain physiology and thus encounter a unique landscape of cellular stress. However, how p62 is regulated in these cell types in response to various stress modalities remains largely unexplored. Several functions for p62 depend on engagement with ubiquitinated substrates. Thus, we investigated how the regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates differs between neurons and astrocytes exposed to two stress modalities: lysosomal membrane damage and metabolic stress. Lysosomal damage triggered ubiquitin-dependent assembly of p62 puncta in both neurons and astrocytes. In contrast, nutrient deprivation elicited different responses between neurons and astrocytes. Neurons formed p62-ubiquitin structures more prominently and displayed a greater dependence on ubiquitin for p62 clustering. Together, these findings reveal cell-type-specific and stress-specific regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates, indicating that neurons and astrocytes can deploy distinct quality control strategies.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

B.; Langa, R. M.; McKenna, G.; Bodziony, I.; Burghardt, N. S.", "abstract": "Background: Methamphetamine (METH) use is higher in adolescent women than men. While rodent studies support a sex difference in the reinforcing effects of METH, few have investigated sex differences in the underlying neural circuits, none of which tested rodents during adolescence. Aims: Investigate whether there are sex differences in the rewarding effects of METH in two strains of adolescent mice that are commonly used to generate transgenic lines. Identify changes in associated neural circuits. Methods: We tested METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male and female 129Sv/Ev and C57Bl/6 mice during middle adolescence using 1mg/kg of METH. Behaviorally-induced upregulation of c-Fos protein expression was quantified in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and area CA1 of the hippocampus following the post-conditioning test. Results: In C57Bl/6 mice, METH induced CPP in females, but not males. Conversely, METH-induced CPP in 129Sv/Ev males, but not females. In both strains, groups that exhibited CPP had more c-Fos+ cells in the NAc and CA1 when compared to saline-treated control groups. The number of c-Fos+ cells in these two brain regions correlated in groups exhibiting CPP, indicating increased NAc-CA1 communication during retrieval of the conditioned memory. Finally, we found evidence of behavioral sensitization in 129Sv/Ev males only. Conclusions: Our study reveals that the rewarding effects of the METH in adolescent mice are both sex- and strain-dependent, indicating that METH response may result from an interaction between sex-specific and genetic mechanisms. Our findings will be informative when selecting an appropriate background strain in future studies using genetically modified mice.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

This threshold level is modifiable through a process called metaplasticity. Some neurons, such as the striatal projection neurons, use different sources of calcium as the signal for synaptic strengthening (long-term potentiation, LTP) or weakening (long-term depression, LTD), resulting in them having two thresholds for inducing plasticity. In this study, we show opposite and complementary roles of metaplasticity in these two thresholds for inducing LTP and LTD on learning how to solve the linear and nonlinear feature binding problem (FBP and NFBP). In short, metaplasticity in one threshold (e.g. LTD) allows synaptic plasticity of the opposite type (e.g. LTP) to be properly expressed. This happens because metaplasticity in the LTD threshold protects strengthened synapses from weakening, thus allowing them to persistently increase during learning (and encode learned patterns). Similarly, metaplasticity in the LTP threhsold prevents weakened synapses from strengthening, thus allowing them to persistently decrease. Metaplasticity in both thresholds is necessary when synapses are clustered and the neuron needs to rely on supralinear dendritic integration for learning.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Dampening neutrophil-driven inflammation in the airways remains a challenge in treating cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a neutrophilic enzyme that produces reactive oxygen species and is highly concentrated in CF sputum samples. Greater MPO concentrations have been previously correlated with increased mucus plugging in bronchiectasis, suggesting that the enzyme could impair mucociliary transport. MPO reacts competitively with either thiocyanate (SCN-) or chloride (Cl-) in the airways to catalyze the production of hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) or hypochlorous acid (HOCl), respectively. HOCl has proved in prior studies to be extremely cytotoxic, while HOSCN can drastically reduce cytotoxicity. The concentration of SCN- in the airways is largely dependent on transport by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which is dysfunctional in individuals with CF and causes low SCN- concentrations. CFTR modulator therapies likely raise the concentration of SCN- and enhance the production of HOSCN in the airways. We found that MPO inhibits mucociliary transport in vitro in regardless of SCN- concentrations primarily due to increasing the macromolecular components and effective viscosity of airway surface liquid. The impairment of mucus clearance by MPO was similar to neutrophil elastase (NE), another neutrophilic granular enzyme that damages the host tissues and induces the secretion of mucin proteins by the airway epithelium. Overall, these findings identify MPO as a therapeutic target to resolve deficits in airway clearance function in CF and other related muco-obstructive lung diseases.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

To address this, we developed a physiological mechanistic model of the 3D tumor microenvironment (TME) to evaluate CAR-T performance under environmental fluctuations and different infusion strategies. The model integrates key vascular (rolling, adhesion, endothelial suppression) and interstitial (ECM density, metabolic competition, chemokine sensitivity) barriers. Our simulations reveal that collagen density and metabolic competition dominate CAR-T efficacy. Enhancing vascular adhesion improves infiltration but remains limited by collagen and metabolism. Endothelial suppression markedly reduces tumor hotness, while its alleviation enhances response. Systemic infusion yields higher tumor hotness than intratumoral delivery, but combined routes or reduced collagen restore efficacy even in dense tumors. This mechanistic framework enables rational optimization of CAR-T strategies.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

This development prompts a significant inquiry into whether procedures and apparatuses designed for examining learning and memory in adults should simply be adapted for use with younger and smaller rodents. The current study examined the effect of arena size on novel object recognition (NOR) performance in juvenile and adult rats. A commonly used larger arena reliably detected novel object preference in adults but not in juveniles. Scaling the arena according to average weight differences between age groups improved NOR performance consistency in juvenile rats. Sex differences were observed: adult males performed reliably across arena sizes, whereas adult females required larger arenas to exhibit effective NOR performance. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring arena dimensions to developmental stage and sex for accurate cognitive assessment. Specifically, they support weight-based arena scaling as a methodological approach in developmental neurobehavioral research and emphasize the importance of careful design when studying female rodents.

In southern Africa, the leguminous tree Colophospermum mopane dominates over one-third of the savanna region and is projected to expand substantially under climate change. Yet, the consequences of its local dominance for biodiversity remain poorly understood. We conducted the first landscape-scale, multi-taxon assessment of mopane's bottom-up effects, analysing species richness and community composition of vascular plants, insects, birds, bats, and non-flying mammals across a gradient of mopane cover in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our replicated plot-based study found that species richness of birds, mammals, bats, and insects declined significantly with increasing mopane dominance, with the steepest reductions in birds. Plant overall species richness was unaffected, although grasses showed a weak positive trend. We also revealed significant community compositional shifts in birds, bats, and mammals, while insect communities lost species without systematic composition change. Functional-group analyses confirmed species richness declines for herbivores across taxa, and for bird carnivores and omnivores, pointing to mopane's role as a strong ecological filter that reduces host plant and other resources availability, with consequences to the higher trophic levels. These results highlight mopane dominance as a potential driver of biodiversity simplification in African savannas, with cascading implications for ecosystem functioning. Given projections of mopane expansion and its socioeconomic value to local communities, management and policy must avoid promoting mopane dominance in land-use or restoration schemes.

To this end, we modified the process-based, two-dimensional model 'Lake2D' to account for stratification in lakes by simulating a shallow layer with fast turbulent mixing, and a deep layer with slow turbulent mixing, separated by a sharp boundary. Using this modified version of Lake2D we comprehensively explored pelagic and benthic algal dynamics across a wide range of ecological conditions by varying lake mean depth, total nutrient content, lake size, and mixing depth in a full-factorial manner. Our results reveal distinct regimes of whole-lake algal dynamics: In shallow, nutrient-poor lakes, pelagic algae are nutrient-limited and sparse, while benthic algae thrive and constitute the majority of the total biomass, with no notable influence of mixed layer depth on algal dynamics. As lakes become deeper or more nutrient-rich, pelagic biomass increases and can become the dominant constituent of total biomass. For deep lakes, the model shows a characteristic L-shaped pattern in algal biomass for varying lake size and mixing depth. Pelagic algae exhibit low biomass in small lakes with a deep mixed layer, and high biomass otherwise. Benthic algae show the opposite pattern, exhibiting high biomass in small, deep lakes with a deep mixed layer, and significantly lower biomass otherwise. The study also uncovers a novel phenomenon, a benthic deep chlorophyll maximum, where the benthic algal biomass peaks at an intermediate depth along the lake bottom. This phenomenon arises in lakes of moderate depth and nutrient content, where a shallow mixed layer enables opposing vertical gradients of light and nutrients. These findings highlight the role of mixed layer depth and horizontal transport in structuring the spatial distribution and overall composition of algal biomass in lakes, underscoring the importance of vertical mixing and lake size for understanding lake primary production.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

To validate the top-ranked GRMs, we employed the hallmark of cancer annotations, enrichment analysis, drug-target gene evaluation, and survival analysis. The cooperativity effect of GRMs was examined through comparative analysis with previously published studies.

DNA methylation inhibitors have been used to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and plastic plant phenotypes. However, their effect in gene expression regulation along lifetime remains understudied in non-model plants. Here, we analyze the effects of seed exposure to 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) in plant gene regulation. Scarified seeds from a single inbred line of Erodium cicutarium were soaked for 48 h in either water or a low concentration solution of 5-azaC before sowing. Subsequently, RNA was extracted from juvenile roots, juvenile leaves and adult leaves, and their transcriptomes were sequenced. Differential gene expression analysis was performed between treatments (control vs. treated) for all tissues together and separately. Beforehand, a draft genome of E. cicutarium was assembled to use it as reference for the transcriptome analysis, and its DNA methyltransferase genes were characterized. We found that 5-azaC up-regulated chromomethylase CMT1 across all treated samples, and the domain rearranged DNA methyltransferase DRM2 in juvenile roots. Furthermore, adult leaves showed more differentially expressed genes between control and 5-azaC treated samples compared to juvenile leaves, supporting long term transcriptomic effects of a short exposure to 5-azaC at seed germination. At adult stage, leaves of individuals treated with 5-azaC exhibited up-regulation of genes involved in seed dormancy release, photoinhibition, and osmotic stress. Finally, gene co-expression network analysis revealed a module of co-expressed genes with differential gene expression linked to 5-azaC treatment in juvenile roots, that was enriched with genes involved in retrotransposon activity and in anthocyanin metabolism. Altogether, this study illustrates how the experimental treatment with 5-azaC at seed stage generates tissue- and age-specific transcriptional shifts, directly affecting gene regulation and potentially broadening phenotype variation in this fast-growing annual plant.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

The psychometric function is typically used to model the responses of individual participants in forced-choice experiments. The accuracy and the noise of the response can be estimated from the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) and the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) of the function, respectively. Traditionally, a two-level approach is used to model the behavior of a group of participants, where psychometric functions are first fitted to individual participant data, followed by hypothesis testing across participants on parameters of interest. Recent studies have introduced alternative approaches based on hierarchical models, such as Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Models within the Bayesian Hierarchical Framework (BHF), to analyze in a single framework the responses from multiple participants. These two approaches can be effectively implemented in R, thanks to its flexibility and robust statistical capabilities. Here, we provide a tutorial on how to model and analyze data from psychophysical experiments in R, using both two-level and hierarchical frameworks.

J.; Li, W.", "abstract": "Sensory processing varies across individuals, often manifesting as distinct traits. Some traits, particularly sensory hypersensitivity, even to basic non-valenced stimuli, are closely linked to emotional traits and implicated in a diversity of psychiatric disorders. Extant theories attribute this sensory-emotion linkage to limbic and prefrontal modulation, but empirical support remains limited. Meanwhile, it is increasingly recognized that sensory cortex supports flexible, value-based processing beyond labeled-line sensory analysis. Assaying early visual cortical activity (using visual evoked potentials/VEPs) across four high-density electroencephalogram (hd-EEG) experiments, involving three independent samples (N = 150) and repeated assessments (up to three waves), we identify a reliable and generalizable pattern of visual cortical hyperactivity related to high trait anxiety. Notably, this effect was specific to the parvocellular (vs. magnocellular) pathway, emerging as early as 46 ms and localized to V1. Underscoring its trait-like stability, the effect was reproducible across different arousal states, neutral and negative stimuli, extended time intervals, and varied experimental paradigms. Moreover, its ecological validity was affirmed by its presence in response to both basic low-level stimuli (Gabor patches) and complex real-world images. Crucially, an excitation-inhibition (E/I) ratio (indexed by the resting-state EEG aperiodic exponent; 1/f slope) predicted parvocellular VEP magnitude in subjects with low but not high trait anxiety, suggesting disrupted E/I modulation in trait anxiety underpins this hyperactivity. We conclude that in trait anxiety, early visual processing deviates from strict fidelity to physical-world input or mere subservience to top-down modulation, instead adapting to an individual biological propensity at the earliest processing stage.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

The network self-organizes its synaptic weights and inter-layer connectivity through a biologically inspired learning rule shaped by probabilistic feedback inhibition and spike-based synchronization dynamics. To characterize the model behavior and identify optimal operating conditions, we systematically examined the effects of key parameters including inhibition strength, synchronization parameters, and preprocessing thresholds on network stability and classification performance. Simulation results show that feedback inhibition is essential for preventing uncontrolled synaptic growth, maintaining sparse connectivity, and enabling stable learning. Strong inhibition suppresses connectivity and weight development, whereas weak inhibition leads to excessive synaptic expansion. An intermediate inhibition regime achieves a balance between adaptability and stability, resulting in the most effective feature extraction. Output-layer neurons exhibited heterogeneous activation dynamics, reflecting diverse encoding of EEG input patterns. The excitatory firing probability was tightly modulated by the inhibition parameter, confirming its central role in shaping network responses. Synchronization parameters further influenced synaptic dynamics, producing nonlinear effects on spike coordination and weight evolution. Classification accuracy peaked at intermediate synchronization levels, revealing an optimal regime where inhibition and synchronization jointly support efficient classification of rightward and leftward EEG data. Additional analyses demonstrated that synaptic pruning substantially improves accuracy across all inhibition levels and that the model performs best when input spikes are generated using a preprocessing threshold of 0.3. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that the developed neural network model achieves an average accuracy of 90% while utilizing only 10% of the available EEG data. Overall, the findings show that the proposed spiking neural network achieves its highest classification performance under moderate inhibition, intermediate synchronization, sparse connectivity, and appropriate pruning. These results highlight the promise of biologically inspired spiking architectures for decoding EEG-based attentional states, particularly in settings with limited training data and strong temporal structure.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Clinical diagnosis typically depends on tracking gradually developing motor symptoms as the disease progresses, underscoring the need for early detection methods to aid intervention while symptoms are still minor. Inexpensive and widely available imaging modalities such as T1-weighted MRI (T1w MRI) have potential for early PD diagnosis but lack established systematic biomarkers of PD pathology. In this study, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) was trained on 100 predominately early-state PD and 100 control T1w MRIs from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), achieving a classification accuracy of 84.5%. Misclassified subjects were majority unmedicated and particularly early PD (< 3 years since first symptoms). To interrogate the biological basis behind the model's decisions, novel explainability methods were applied to generate regional saliency maps from both PD and control classifications. Regional saliency across subjects correlated best with cognitive and motor scores in nigrostriatal and other subcortical regions, as well as in temporal and insular cortices, indicating changes in these areas were best connected with symptom progression. The model was also sensitive to changes in the left frontal cortex across many subjects, which exhibited the greatest raw saliency magnitude. Pairwise saliency correlation was most pronounced between areas within the same functional network, suggesting the CNN was sensitive to network level changes in structural MRI.

Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 disease) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorder resulting from an inherited dysfunction of the lysosome. CLN2 disease, and its representative animal models, display neuroimmune response, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and epileptic seizures, and these symptoms are all touted as potential targets of cannabidiol therapeutic benefit. Here, we treated a valid model of CLN2 disease with long-term daily cannabidiol (300mg/kg) from 1 month of age until disease end stage and evaluated epileptic seizures, lifespan, and markers of neuroimmune response. Chronic cannabidiol treatment significantly delayed or fully eliminated seizures in CLN2 mice compared to those treated with vehicle only, and the treatment led to a nearly significant extension of lifespan. These effects occurred in the absence of any therapeutic benefit to physiological markers of disease such as GFAP, CD68, and cytokine/chemokine reactivity. Taken together, we show that chronic treatment with cannabidiol confers significant anti-seizure benefit to the mouse model of CLN2 disease, and that it does not appear to do so by altering the inflammatory and neuroimmune markers traditionally used to track CLN2 disease progression.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Existing clinical and serological markers only partially explain this variability and are not routinely used to personalise drug choice. We hypothesised that integrated plasma proteomic - metabolomic profiling could capture dimensions of RA molecular heterogeneity that are invisible to standard phenotyping and highlight characteristic patterns of metabolic dysregulation. We profiled 384 proteins and 1,063 metabolites in 80 RA patients and 40 healthy controls. Unsupervised consensus clustering of the integrated omics matrix identified two stable molecular subtypes within the RA cohort. Anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) status, which in this cohort was evenly split overall (40 ACPA-positive, 40 ACPA-negative), was similarly distributed across the two subtypes, suggesting that the molecular groupings reflect heterogeneity orthogonal to conventional serology. Protein-metabolite association network analysis revealed a substantial reduction in association edges in RA versus controls, with pathway-specific effects: pronounced connectivity loss in amino-acid metabolism but paradoxical gains in inflammatory mediators including glutamate and sphingolipids. Preserved correlation strength among surviving edges is consistent with selective pathway disconnection rather than uniformly weakened coordination. These hypothesis-generating findings, limited by cross-sectional design, medication heterogeneity, and single-centre recruitment, suggest that RA comprises molecularly distinct subtypes not captured by standard serological categories and is associated with extensive metabolic net- work reorganisation. This multiomics framework illustrates how network-level signatures could support future precision stratification efforts and motivates further investigation of metabolic network restoration as a potential therapeutic avenue.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

In the prospective observational TARGET-HISTIO cohort study, we investigated extra-CNS mosaicism of BRAFV600E in a cohort of 124 adults with histiocytosis. Seeking widespread mosaicism, we analyzed healthy skin biopsies from areas without histiocytosis or melanocytic infiltration using high-sensitivity digital polymerase chain reaction. BRAFV600E was detected in healthy skin in 57/67 (85%) patients with BRAFV600E histiocytosis and was present in all second and third skin biopsies (n=6).

While molecular detection methods have identified Bdellovibrionaceae DNA in human-associated environments, viable predatory bacteria had never been successfully isolated from human samples, limiting our understanding of their ecology and therapeutic potential. Here, we report the first successful isolation and characterization of viable Bdellovibrio strains from human fecal samples. Despite extremely low natural abundance requiring enrichment protocols for detection, two of five pooled samples yielded viable predators with characteristic lytic activity. Whole-genome sequencing of two isolates revealed >99% average nucleotide identity to the reference strain HD100 with only 26 total single nucleotide polymorphisms, indicating minimal genomic divergence between human-associated and environmental strains. Comparative genomic analysis of 163 publicly available Bdellovibrio genomes demonstrated that only 10.4% represented true B. bacteriovorussensu stricto, highlighting substantial cryptic diversity within this genus. Pangenome analysis across 41 genomes revealed a highly conserved core genome (~2,500-2,650 genes) contrasting with an expanding accessory genome, reflecting functional constraints of obligate predation alongside ecological adaptation. Notably, human-associated isolates exhibited narrower prey ranges, including some multidrug-resistant isolates.

We developed a GFP-nanobody-based targeting tool to activate centrosomes in C. elegans differentiated cells. Ectopically activating centrosomes in sensory neurons perturbed microtubule polarity, dynein-mediated trafficking, and caused defects in cell morphology and dendrite pathfinding. Ectopic PCM perturbed ciliogenesis and also protected centrioles from elimination, another common feature of differentiation.

For example, the outer trophectoderm (TE) comprises a monolayer of epithelialized cells surrounding the inner-cell mass (ICM) and blastocyst cavity. In mice, TEAD4 is known as a transcription factor that regulates TE-specific genes in a polarity-dependent manner during TE specification. Here we show that it also maintains blastocyst TE integrity, as knocking down (KD) Tead4 via clonal siRNA causes abnormal morphology of outer-cell apical domains, which correlates with the atypical contribution of Tead4-KD cell clones to an enlarged ICM throughout blastocyst maturation; with only minimal feedback on established apical polarity. Light-sheet live-cell embryo imaging reveals these cells either actively migrate into the ICM, sometimes involving apical domain abscission, or are positioned post-division, linking disrupted apical morphology to cell repositioning. RNA-Seq data indicate TEAD4 regulates genes related to the cytoskeleton, particularly actin, and cell adhesion, which we propose are required for the appropriate maintenance of the spatial positioning of specified TE cells in the blastocyst. Indeed, knocking down Tead4 in combination with two identified target genes, the atypical GTPases Rnd1 and Rnd3, partially rescues aberrant outer-to-inner cell allocations but does not influence the onset of apical domain morphological abnormalities. These findings indicate that Tead4 and its regulated transcriptome actively contribute to the maintenance of the outer TE lineage until the peri-implantation stage.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Marker gene in situ hybridisation revealed that Piwi/Nanos1-expressing cells within the presumptive endoderm of the early gastrula generate a substantial pool of nematoblasts, some of which migrate and differentiate into the planula ectoderm. Neurogenic transcription factor expression showed a markedly distinct pattern, predominantly in a basal layer of the aboral/lateral ectoderm during gastrula stages. Embryo bisection and lineage tracing experiments confirmed that neurosensory and secretory cell types derive from gastrula ectoderm, while nematocytes and at least some ganglionic cells derive from i-cells. Knockdown and inhibitor treatments revealed steps of both neurogenesis and nematogenesis regulated by Wnt-beta-catenin.

In the human liver, ketogenesis-associated genes showed sex-dependent correlations with inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. In mice, fasting increased circulating ketone bodies, with females exhibiting a greater rise, indicating intrinsic sex differences in ketone metabolism. IF reduced body weight and adiposity in both sexes, and these systemic benefits persisted despite antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated knockdown of hepatic Hmgcs2. In contrast, hepatic benefits were sex- and ketogenesis-dependent. IF markedly reduced steatosis and fibrosis in male mice, but these improvements were attenuated or abolished when hepatic ketogenesis was disrupted. Female mice showed minimal hepatic benefit from IF and displayed heightened susceptibility to steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammatory activation under ketogenic insufficiency. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses identified neutrophils and myofibroblasts as key responders to hepatocyte-derived ketone bodies, and IF suppressed neutrophil-driven inflammatory signaling in a ketogenesis-dependent manner in males but not females. Together, these findings demonstrate that while systemic metabolic improvements from IF are largely ketogenesis-independent, the hepatic anti-steatotic and anti-fibrotic effects of IF are sexually dimorphic and require intact hepatic ketogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

This research demonstrates how two distinct training modalities, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), influence oxygen transport dynamics and microvascular remodeling. Methods: Twenty-five healthy sedentary adults (15 women, 10 men; mean age 25{+/-}2 years; normal BMI) were randomly assigned to HIIT or MICT for 8 weeks. VO2max was assessed before and after the training program. 15 participants underwent non-invasive maximal cardiac output measurement (Qmax), while vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from 10 participants. Tissue samples were cleared and immunolabeled for VE-cadherin and alpha-smooth muscle actin to observe microvasculature architecture. A computational hemodynamic model integrating cardiac output and microvascular parameters was constructed to estimate flow dynamics. Results: VO2max increased significantly in both training groups, with a greater improvement in HIIT (p=0.024). Qmax increased similarly in both groups (p=0.001), while calculated arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-vO2 diff) showed a trend toward improvement only in HIIT. No formation of new capillaries nor anastomoses (angiogenesis) was detected in either group; however, both HIIT and MICT induced significant capillary and venule dilation. Notably, only HIIT led to a significant increase in pericyte coverage (p=0.047). Venules of both groups exhibited dilation accompanied by increased surrounding smooth muscle cells. No remodeling was found in arterioles. Hemodynamic modelisation estimated higher shear stress during HIIT than MICT and vasodilation tended to decrease shear stress over time during both training. Furthermore, pericyte recruitment was modelized to adapt to shear stress level limiting excessive capillary dilation during high effort intensity. Conclusion: HIIT induces superior improvements in VO?max and distinct microvascular structural adaptations rather than angiogenesis. HIIT is supposed to stimulate a protective adaptation at the capillary level, limiting excessive dilation during maximal effort. Our hemodynamic model supports this shear stress-dependent mechanism. These findings underscore the role of exercise intensity and hemodynamics in shaping microvascular responses to endurance training.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Somatosensory processing abnormalities and altered thalamo-cortical connectivity have been implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, raising the possibility that targeted somatosensory stimulation may modulate affective circuits. Here, we examined whether chronic cervical vibration improves depression-like behaviors in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, a well-established model of treatment-resistant depression. Rats received repeated vibration stimulation applied to the cervical region. Behavioral effects were evaluated using the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and the forced swim test (FST). Swimming activity was quantified during the late-phase of the FST to exclude early panic-like behavior. Immunohistochemistry for c-Fos was performed in the dorsal raphe (DR), lateral habenula (LHb), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Vibration-treated rats showed significantly shorter feeding latencies in the NSFT and significantly increased swimming distance during the analysis period of the FST. No significant group differences in c-Fos expression were observed in DR, LHb, PVN, or PFC. These findings indicate that chronic cervical vibration produces reproducible improvements in depressive-like behavior in WKY rats. Because c-Fos activity remained unchanged, the behavioral effects may reflect gradual changes in broader network processing rather than acute activation of monoaminergic or habenular-prefrontal pathways. Cervical vibration represents a simple, non-invasive sensory intervention with translational potential. Additional mechanistic studies are warranted.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Yet inflammation-inciting factors in CKD are insufficiently characterized. Oxalate, long implicated in rare genetic kidney disorders, accumulates in CKD as a uremic toxin and has emerged as an independent risk factor for CVD. Here, we investigate immunological mechanisms linking oxalate to renal injury, systemic inflammation, and cardiac damage. Methods and Results: Oxalate nephropathy was induced in C57Bl6/N mice via an oxalate-enriched diet. Oxalate induced systemic immune activation, renal fibrosis, and cardiac remodeling, including pulmonary congestion with systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Flow cytometry analysis identified interleukin (IL)-17A as a dominant inflammatory effector, with expansion of Th17 and Th17-like Treg in the kidney, intestine, and spleen. Bulk mRNA sequencing confirmed these findings. In line, plasma IL-17A was elevated in patients with primary hyperoxaluria. Gut microbiome analysis by 16S amplicon sequencing showed only mild oxalate-induced alterations. However, soluble oxalate directly enhanced Th17 polarization and disrupted mitochondrial respiration in vitro. In vivo, antibody-mediated (clone: 17F3) IL-17A blockade decreased cardiac fibrosis, reduced neutrophil infiltration, and partially restored cardiac function in C57Bl6/N mice fed an oxalate-enriched diet. Conclusions: Our study identifies oxalate as a systemic immunometabolic stressor and IL-17A as a central mediator of oxalate-induced cardiorenal injury. These findings establish the oxalate-IL-17A axis as a mechanistic link between CKD and CVD and suggest IL-17A inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce cardiovascular damage in CKD.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Given the immense diversity of environmental microbiomes, selecting appropriate partners from such a vast microbial pool poses a critical challenge for host organisms. To meet this challenge, hosts have evolved sophisticated internal partner-choice mechanisms that ensure stable associations with beneficial microbes. However, because these symbionts primarily inhabit external environments, environmental conditions themselves are also expected to play pivotal roles in the establishment of symbiosis. Despite this expectation, the mechanistic role of external environmental filters in shaping the intended symbiosis remains largely unexplored. Focusing on stink bugs, which acquire their symbiotic bacteria from soil each generation, we investigated how soil properties influence the establishment of gut symbiosis in terrestrial insects. Results: Microbiome analyses confirmed that Burkholderia sensu lato overwhelmingly dominates a specific gut organ in six stink bug species from the superfamilies Coreoidea and Lygaeoidea, including serious agricultural pests (relative abundance ranging from 74.5% to 100%). Rearing experiments with isolated Burkholderia revealed that insects were strictly dependent on this symbiont; failure to acquire it from soil severely reduced host growth and reproduction, indicating that the availability of symbionts from soil represents an ecological bottleneck. Field surveys identified patches of exceptionally high stink bug density in weedy fields with soil pH <7.0, whereas such aggregations were absent in fields with pH [&ge;]7.0. Laboratory experiments with collected field soils showed that the abundance of Burkholderia in soils was negatively correlated with soil pH, and stink bugs readily acquired their symbionts from soils with pH <7.0 but rarely from soils with pH [&ge;]7.0. Experimental manipulations of soil pH followed by rearing experiments confirmed that increasing soil pH to 7- 8 markedly suppressed symbiont acquisition by the host, likely by impairing symbiont growth and motility. Conclusions: We demonstrate that, beyond host-intrinsic mechanisms, a soil chemical property externally filters symbiotic bacteria prior to colonization inside the host. These findings reveal that, alongside host physiology, environmental conditions - mediated through the soil and host gut microbiomes - shape the assembly, maintenance, and evolution of host - microbe symbiotic associations.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Investigating the functional implications of the remaining NPR/NH genes is critical for the development of disease-resistant rice cultivars. This study explores the role of OsNH2 in rice defense against sheath blight (ShB) using CRISPR/Cas9-edited mutants of the susceptible cultivar ASD16 and the moderately resistant CO51. OsNH2 knockout mutants showed increased susceptibility to ShB, as evidenced by dense mycelial growth, wider hyphae, and elevated superoxide radical content. Two in-frame deletion mutants lacking 15 to 17 amino acids in the BTB/POZ domain also showed higher susceptibility, highlighting the importance of an intact OsNH2 protein for resistance. qRT-PCR analysis revealed significant downregulation of OsNH1, OsNH3, key transcription factors (WRKY4, WRKY45, WRKY80, TGA2 and TGA3), pathogenesis-related (PR) genes (PR1, PR3 and PR5), and SA biosynthesis genes (PAL and ICS1) in the mutants. Additionally, OsNH2 mutants in both cultivars exhibited reduced endogenous SA levels upon Rhizoctonia solani infection. Exogenous SA treatment partially restored resistance and upregulated OsNH1/3 expression in mutants, though not to wild-type levels. These results suggest that OsNH2 is essential for maintaining SA-mediated defense signaling and optimal expression of NPR1 homologs. Moreover, OsNH2 mutants also showed increased susceptibility to bacterial leaf blight (BLB). Collectively, this research highlights the critical role of OsNH2 in coordinating with OsNH1 and OsNH3 in SA-mediated defense against ShB and BLB in rice.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we fully characterised the EVs released by MDA-MB-231 or HEK-293T cells cultured in 10% EV-DEP DMEM or a commonly used serum-free synthetic medium, Opti-MEM. Cells cultured in Opti-MEM released a significantly higher yield of CD9- and CD63-positive EVs as compared to cells grown in EV-DEP DMEM. In MDA-MB-231 cells the increased EV release was likely driven by nutrient deprivation (decreased phospho-S6) and increased cell stress (increased phospho-AKT). MDA-MB-231 cells grown in EV-DEP DMEM relied upon actin cytoskeleton dynamics for up to 50% of EVs released, while cells in Opti-MEM did not use ROCK kinases for EV biogenesis. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the EV proteomes from both conditions were largely unchanged other than EV-DEP DMEM EVs contained more histones and bovine proteins. Addition of 2.5-10% serum or 2.5 mg/mL albumin to Opti-MEM medium partially rescued some cell stress phenotypes and returned EV release rates to that of cells in EV-DEP DMEM. The choice of media is an important consideration when designing EV studies and their downstream applications. While Opti-MEM increased cell stress, it achieved a high yield of EVs that were depleted of histones and contaminating bovine proteins - useful for therapeutic applications. Alternatively, EV-DEP DMEM produced a decreased yield of EVs in lower stress conditions, however, the EVs were histone and bovine protein rich which may have important implications for use for use in therapeutic or immunological experiments.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

We investigated landscape-dispersal-diversity relationships in nectar-inhabiting bacteria that disperse via flower-visiting insects. Field observation and experiments revealed that bacterial diversity and abundance peaked at an intermediate frequency of insect visits, which was in turn determined by the surrounding landscape characteristics observed at the 200-m radius scale.

Despite rapid craniofacial divergence of trophic specialists within 8-15 kya, only two candidate genes (3.6%) were shared between Caribbean radiations. Although adaptive introgression played a major role in SSI, we found minimal evidence of adaptive introgression in Chichancanab, likely due to the higher geographical isolation of this inland lake. Instead, de novo mutations provided a substantial source of adaptive variation (30.6%) for the endemic zooplanktivore, nearly 10 times higher than the scale-eater in SSI. We found strong evidence that selection occurred in stages, first on regulatory and standing genetic variation, then on de novo and nonsynonymous mutations, parallel to SSI. Unique to Chichancanab, adaptive variants near opsin and spermatogenesis genes are consistent with our findings of greater visual acuity and differences in sperm morphology, respectively, within the zoooplanktivore.

However, the specific reproductive barriers preventing the fusion of such populations generally remain unclear, particularly the role of ecologically-based divergent selection. To address the latter, we here investigate a steep hybrid zone between lake and stream ecotypes of threespine stickleback fish inhabiting contiguous habitats within a single watershed. Given the spatial proximity of these habitats and the system's postglacial age, historical allopatry is unlikely to have contributed to the evolution of reproductive isolation. Using individual whole-genome sequencing from clinal sampling sites, we find that hybridization occurs within a narrow zone - just a few hundred meters long - at the transition between lake and stream habitat. Individuals in this contact zone exhibit strongly bimodal genome-wide ancestry, with a rapid shift toward the stream ecotype's genomic background, consistent with strong selection against lake-derived alleles in the stream habitat. Individual-based simulations tailored to this system demonstrate that divergent ecological selection alone can maintain the observed sharp cline, and illustrate the sustained antagonism between gene flow and selection near the habitat transition. Our findings underscore the power of ecological divergence to generate and maintain reproductive isolation, even in the absence of historical separation, and motivate further empirical work on the ecological underpinnings of steep hybrid zones.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

However, the processes that generate this complexity are poorly studied in longitudinal samples. Here, we study the temporal dynamics of TNBC somatic mutations, revealing major transitions in tumour genome evolution, from diagnostic biopsies, through treatment, to cancer remission or recurrence. Methods Deep whole exome sequencing and CUTseq, a reduced representation whole genome sequencing approach, were performed in parallel, to comprehensively identify short nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number alterations (CNAs) and aneuploidies. Tumour samples (N=74) from 22 patients were profiled before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), and encompassed spatially diverse samples from multiple primary breast tumours, to allow tracking of the gain and loss of candidate driver variants over time. Results Genome-wide SNV mutational burden remained stable across disease progression and RCB classes. However, recurrent SNVs were identified in several known TNBC driver genes in response to treatment, with TP53, MICA, CYP2D6, BRCA1, and BRCA2 being frequently altered. The candidate driver variants in these genes frequently exhibited dynamic changes throughout the course of a patient's treatment, with the original SNVs in pre-treatment samples often lost, while novel variants in the same genes emerged at subsequent time points. In contrast to the stable genome-wide SNV burdens, dramatic changes in chromosome structure were seen in all tumours, with abundant CNAs and chromosome arm aneuploidies seen in pre-treatment samples, followed by frequent loss of these alterations post-treatment, and their re-emergence at recurrence. Whole genome duplication (WGD) events appear to drive these dynamics, with a higher frequency of pre-treatment WGD seen in patients with the best response to NACT. Conclusions Comprehensive longitudinal profiling of the TNBC genome demonstrates the complex interplay of SNVs and structural alterations during tumour progression, leading to diverse evolutionary trajectories impacting patient outcomes. Complex mutational patterns encompassing entire chromosomes emerge during progression, with WGD events making major contributions to intra-tumour heterogeneity, and emerging as a potential candidate biomarker of response at both tumour establishment and recurrence.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

In rice, it produces Bacterial Panicle Blight (BPB), an emerging disease that is threatening the production of this staple food worldwide. Recently, BPB has affected several rice fields in Bangladesh, and B. gladioli has been reported as the causative agent in one of these fields, raising questions about how the pathogen was introduced into the country. Understanding the introduction routes into Bangladesh and the pathogenicity mechanisms of B. gladioli is essential to develop sustainable management strategies to control BPB. Results: To investigate the origin of pathogenic B. gladioli strains and their introduction routes into Bangladesh, we sequenced the complete genomes of 19 strains isolated from symptomatic rice panicles from four major rice-growing districts of the country (Rangpur, Faridpur, Natore, and Mymensingh). A phylogenetic analysis encompassing all 320 publicly available B. gladioli genomes along with the 19 newly sequenced genomes revealed five independent introduction events into Bangladesh - four of which showed close phylogenetic links to clinical isolates from the USA -and no evidence of inter-district dissemination within the country. Many host transitions (35 human-to-plant and 1 plant-to-human) were inferred across the phylogeny, highlighting the pathogen's versatile and cross-kingdom transmission dynamics. Analysis of the presence/absence patterns of 37 virulence-related genes across all 339 B. gladioli strains indicated that human-to-plant host transitions often coincided with loss of the tsr and motB genes - which are associated with bacterial motility -, suggesting convergent adaptive shifts in response to host switches.

However, whether and how much this mechanism determines mRNA decay rates in plants is unsettled. Furthermore, whether factors other than charged tRNA abundance influence codon optimality remains unexplored. Here, biased codon usage in Arabidopsis correlated with mRNA decay rates. A codon-optimality model of mRNA decay rate based on codon frequencies was tested using synonymously recoded genes. mRNA decay rates of these alleles in transgenic plants was consistent with the model predictions. Arabidopsis appears to use the same mechanism for sensing low optimality codons as yeast and humans because the N-terminal sensor domain of NOT3 is conserved. However, decay rates were also affected by codon context. Neighboring codons adjacent nucleotides consistently shifted codon correlations with decay rate in Arabidopsis, which was also observed in other published datasets revealing an influence of codon sequence on translation that is independent of charged tRNA concentrations. Codons frequencies explained 21% of decay rate variance, suggesting codon optimality-mediated decay is one of multiple mechanisms that determine decay rates in plants.

Although TAF15 is also linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the molecular basis and propagation behavior of its aggregates remain unknown. In this work, we show that recombinant TAF15 forms amyloid fibrils under physiological conditions and developed a single-fluorophore TAF15 biosensor to quantitatively monitor their cellular propagation. Using this system, we demonstrate that both recombinant TAF15 fibrils and pathological aggregates extracted from atypical FTLD with ubiquitin inclusions (aFTLD-U) patient brains seed aggregation efficiently and transmit serially between cells, demonstrating hallmark features of prion-like propagation. Seeding was specific to TAF15 and absent for other amyloidogenic proteins, including the homologous protein fused-in-sarcoma (FUS), revealing an unexpected cross-seeding barrier. Occasional colocalization of FUS within TAF15 inclusions was observed upon transient co-expression, suggesting that FUS can be passively recruited rather than acting as an inducer of pathology in FTLD-FET brains. Computational and peptide-based experimental mapping identified multiple aggregation-prone regions within the TAF15 low-complexity domain that coincide with hotspots stabilizing the core of ex vivo TAF15 amyloid fibrils.

However, current experimental models of GBC face critical limitations, particularly their dependence on immunodeficient hosts, which precludes the investigation of the tumor microenvironment.We aimed to establish a novel syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model that recapitulates human GBC and enables the investigation of tumor-immune interactions. Methods: We engineered a murine cell line (mGBC1-ZH) from normal mouse gallbladder organoids expressing Kras and Trp53 (encoding mouse p53) mutations. Tumorigenic potential of mGBC1-ZH was evaluated by subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation. RNA-Seq and WES was used to demonstrate its characterization and similarity with human GBC. Immunohistochemistry, CCK8, and transwell assays were used to investigate the role of CXCL5 in GBC. Therapeutic responses to standard first-line chemotherapeutic agents was evaluated in the syngeneic GBC model. Results: This model supports both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor growth in immunocompetent C57BL/6J hosts while preserving hallmark features of human GBC, including biliary epithelial differentiation (CK7+/CK19+), aggressive histopathology, and an immunosuppressive \"cold\" tumor microenvironment. Genomic characterization revealed recurrent chromosomal instability and copy number alterations mirroring human GBC.Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling revealed profound gene expression changes during the model development, and resembled transcriptional features between mGBC1-ZH and human GBC cell lines and samples.

Functional validation of the syngeneic GBC model demonstrated therapeutic responsiveness to frontline chemotherapeutics gemcitabine and cisplatin with significant in vivo tumor regression. Conclusions: In summary, we established a novel syngeneic GBC mouse model, overcoming the limitations of traditional models by enabling studies in immunocompetent hosts.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback can enable users to modulate their brain activity through real-time feedback. However, evidence for its clinical effectiveness remains inconclusive, partly due to limited personalization and insufficient task relevance in existing protocols. Objective: We tested whether personalized EEG neurofeedback supervised by deep neural networks (DNNs) can enhance cognitive performance in older adults. Methods: Fifty-seven healthy adults aged 41 to 64 (31 women), including a sham-feedback control group, completed a personalized neurofeedback protocol with DNNs fine-tuned to individual EEG patterns. The procedure included pre- and post-training assessments using a transitive reasoning task, three diagnostic sessions to adapt the DNN to each participant, and 10 neurofeedback sessions based on a gamified delayed-match-to-sample paradigm. Results: The training group showed robust gains across all three variants of the reasoning task (each p < .01), whereas the sham group improved only on the easiest variant. Groups did not differ at pretest; however, at posttest the training group outperformed the sham group on all task conditions (each p < .03), showing also a larger neural effort (lower alpha band power) and increased beta and gamma band connectivity (higher phase lag index). Conclusion: Personalized, task-oriented neurofeedback guided by individually fine-tuned DNNs can produce cognitive enhancement after relatively few sessions. The proposed Task-Pretrained, Subject-Finetuned Neurofeedback (TPSF-NF) framework is scalable to other cognitive domains in future research.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

We previously identified that a decreasing temporal gradient of the RNA-binding protein Imp encodes neural stem cell age in Drosophila. In this work, we extend our investigation to Imp1, a mammalian homologue of Imp, and its role in murine neocortical development. Using TEMPO to track birth-order dynamics, we demonstrate that sustained Imp1 overexpression during early neurogenesis arrests temporal fate progression, shifting neuronal populations toward deeper cortical layers V-VI. Immunostaining with layer-specific transcription factors Cux1 and Ctip2 confirmed that laminar repositioning results from genuine changes in neuronal identity rather than migratory defects, with neurons adopting molecular identities matching their final positions. Temporal window-specific manipulations reveal distinct stage-specific effects where early-stage Imp1 induction produces cascading effects on fate specification and moderately delays the neuronal-to-gliogenic transition, while mid-stage induction induces neuronal accumulation in the subplate region. Live imaging of organotypic cultures reveals continuous neuronal recruitment within intermediate and ventricular zones, with mid-stage-born neurons accumulating at significantly faster rates than earlier cohorts. Strikingly, mid-stage Imp1 overexpression also induces ectopic glial-like foci distributed throughout the cortical plate, featuring dramatic cellular expansion and morphological heterogeneity. These findings establish Imp1 as a dosage- and stage-dependent temporal rheostat orchestrating developmental transitions in radial glial progenitors, controlling neuronal fate decisions and spatial organization.

We examined dyadic coordination in a non-human primate ASD model under experimentally controlled yet naturalistic conditions. Markerless pose estimation was used to quantify frame-by-frame gaze behavior and inter-individual distance during first encounters between unfamiliar common marmosets. Dyads with a prenatal valproic acid-exposed animal and an unexposed partner (VPA-UE) were compared with unexposed controls (UE-UE). VPA-UE pairs showed a higher proportion and greater number of mutual gaze episodes, whereas overall gaze shift was similar across groups. VPA marmosets made fewer unreciprocated looks; however, when the partner looked at them, they more often returned the look within 1 s, indicating heightened gaze reactivity. VPA-UE dyads maintained shorter inter-individual distances, and the closer proximity destabilized mutual gaze more strongly than in UE-UE dyads. These findings indicate a distinct dyadic-coordination pattern in VPA-UE pairs: rapid responsiveness combined with reduced tolerance for close spacing, consistent with distance-dependent differences rather than a global deficit in social motivation.

While MEK inhibitors such as trametinib, alone or in combination with BRAF inhibitors, are clinically effective, their therapeutic effects are restricted due to the development of drug resistance. Here we establish a Caenorhabditis elegans model carrying the oncogenic lin-45(V627E) allele, functionally equivalent to human BRAF(V600E), to investigate mechanisms of trametinib resistance. Genetic suppressor screening and transcriptomic profiling reveal that the EGL-30/Gq-PLC{beta}-PKC axis promotes resistance by sustaining MAPK activity under MEK blockade. Pharmacological inhibition of PLC{beta} or PKC synergizes with trametinib to abolish MAPK signaling and restore drug sensitivity in worms. Importantly, this resistance mechanism is conserved in human melanoma: combined MEK and Gq-PLC{beta}-PKC inhibition markedly enhances trametinib efficacy in BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells and xenografts, and reverses acquired resistance in trametinib-resistant melanoma sublines.

However, how these bacteria are sensed by plants and how this sensing results in a systemic response is not well understood. Recently, the Brassicaceae LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE-SPECIFIC REDUCED ELICITATION (LORE) receptor kinase was identified as the direct sensor of bacterial medium-chain-length 3-hydroxy fatty acids (mc-3-OH-FAs) and 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acids (HAAs), which activate systemic Brassicaceae immunity. Here, we show that the bacterium Pantoea ananatis BRT175, which produces HAAs, can colonize Arabidopsis thaliana roots independently of the production of these compounds. P. ananatis triggers induced systemic resistance (ISR) to the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea, but not to the hemibiotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringaepv. tomato. Importantly, this ISR can be mimicked by HAAs or 3-hydroxy-decanoic acid (3-OH-C10). Both P. ananatis-triggered and 3-OH-C10-triggered ISR against B. cinerea are mediated by LORE sensing, involve salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling pathways, and activate the expression of similar defense genes in infected leaves. Thus, 3-OH-C10 and HAAs are perceived by a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) in the root and activate a local immune response in roots as well as systemic immunity in leaves. Our study demonstrates that these lipidic microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), produced by beneficial microorganisms, are necessary and sufficient to trigger rhizobacteria-driven ISR. It further highlights the role of these MAMPs in differentially activating systemic resistance against biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Months After Planting (MAP) emerged as the most influential factor, accounting for 19.82% of total variance, while genotypic effects were modest (Broad Sense Heritabilty = 4.4%) and seasonal effects reached statistical significance when accessions were treated as fixed. Residual variance dominated (70.98%), suggesting the influence of unmeasured factors such as soil properties, pest pressure, and microclimatic variation.

Here, we analysed spatio-temporal patterns of metazoan communities over one year in four medium-size harbours along the NW Mediterranean coast sampled by deploying standardised biological collectors. Using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) metabarcoding, we identified 1,770 metazoan molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs), of which 82 were classified as NIS based on a custom database of Mediterranean NIS. Despite their lower species count compared to natives, NIS accounted for 34-70% of reads in harbours. The southernmost harbour had the highest NIS number of reads, likely due to its proximity to aquaculture facilities. While we observed some variation in the spatial structure of metazoan communities across harbours, NIS showed consistently low differentiation values, sharing significantly more MOTUs among sites. Seasonal patterns influenced both NIS and the rest of the community. Haplotype diversity was significantly higher in NIS, which also exhibited lower genetic differentiation across harbours compared to native species, indicating NIS spread via local boating and likely recurrent introductions.

Earlier diagnoses can benefit patients, and APS-1 diagnosis by AIRE sequencing is increasingly common.

A great deal is known about the structure of riboswitch ligand-binding aptamer domains through evolutionary sequence covariation analysis. However, covariation analysis has been more difficult to apply to riboswitch expression platforms given their large range in cellular functions, and their large sequence diversity. Here, we develop an approach to identify whole transcriptional riboswitch sequences starting from their conserved aptamer domains. We then generate covariation models for the entire riboswitch including the aptamer domain and the expression platform. The method consists of first bioinformatically extending identified aptamer domains to include downstream sequence that could contain an expression platform. Filtering is then performed using either a computational prediction algorithm to identify bacterial intrinsic terminator sequences in the expression platform, or a high-throughput functional assay that uses massive parallel oligo synthesis and next generation sequencing to characterize transcriptional termination of riboswitch candidates as a function of ligand. Filtered sequences are then used to develop full riboswitch sequence covariation models. We developed this approach in the context of the fluoride riboswitch, characterizing 1901 fluoride riboswitch sequences using our high-throughput assay. We find that the prediction filtering approach results in few false positives to identify novel, highly functional fluoride riboswitch variants. Finally, we employ the computational approach to develop covariation models of the ZTP, lysine, and TPP riboswitches and find covariation support for previously published rearrangement mechanisms.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of INVA8001, a highly selective chymase inhibitor, on PSC pathogenesis in the Mdr2 knockout mouse (Mdr2-/- mice) model of PSC. Approach and Results: We evaluated the levels of chymase and other MC markers in liver biopsy samples collected from late-stage PSC patients. The effect of chymase inhibition was evaluated using a highly selective and potent small molecule chymase inhibitor, INVA8001, in Mdr2-/- mice. Ten-week-old male Mdr2-/- mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 20 mg/kg of INVA8001 daily for two weeks and varying parameters of disease pathogenesis, including MC activation, inflammation, fibrosis, biliary pathology, and cholestasis were evaluated. In addition, histological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and molecular analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of INVA8001 treatment in Mdr2-/- mice. The liver biopsies of PSC patients showed an increased number of chymase-positive cells compared with control samples (collected from non-diseased patients). INVA8001 treatment resulted in a reduction of MC accumulation, inflammation, histological damage, fibrosis, ductular reaction, and biliary senescence in Mdr2-/- mice. The current data show the pathophysiological role of chymase in PSC and the impact of a selective chymase inhibitor on PSC disease pathogenesis. This can further be extrapolated to various MC-driven diseases such as chronic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, asthma, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, among others, where chymase is central to the disease pathogenesis. Conclusions: Our findings identify chymase as a key driver of PSC pathogenesis establishing INVA8001 as a promising new therapeutic candidate for hepatobiliary disorders, including PSC. Chymase inhibition simultaneously targets MC activation, inflammation, fibrosis, and biliary senescence, and offers a multifaceted approach to treating PSC and other MC-related disorders.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Restoring hepatic FGF10 with recombinant human FGF10 or adeno-associated virus mediated liver-targeted expression attenuated and partially reversed established advanced bridging fibrosis, reduced inflammation, and decreased hepatocyte apoptosis, and these benefits required hepatocyte FGFR2 because hepatocyte-specific Fgfr2 deletion abolished protection. In primary hepatocytes, FGF10 activated FGFR2-FRS2, increased inhibitory GSK3{beta}(Ser9) phosphorylation, and suppressed NF-{kappa}B activation, reducing TGF-{beta}1 and other cytokines and thereby limiting paracrine hepatic stellate cells activation. The molecular and histologic benefits extended to metabolically primed steatohepatitis, supporting translatability beyond toxicant injury. Mechanistic signaling readouts confirm FGFR2 engagement, while the main text centers on the hepatocyte FGF10-FGFR2 axis as an intrinsic brake on fibrogenesis.

Furthermore, they are exuded from roots and act as signaling molecules for inter-organism communication in the rhizosphere. Strigolactones trigger those responses by inducing protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of signaling components and subsequent proteolysis of transcriptional repressors. The sequential event involves SL hydrolysis mediated by SL receptors belonging to an /{beta}-hydrolase family, although the physiological role of SL hydrolysis is a subject of debate. To date, SL-induced PPIs have been analyzed by methods such as yeast-two hybrid, pull-down, and AlphaScreen assays. However, the kinetic aspect of PPI profiles has not been well studied. Here, we developed an in vitro method to monitor the formation of the SL signaling complex based on Time-Resolved Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) technology. Our TR-FRET-based assay system allows us to analyze the mode of action of SL analogs from kinetic and quantitative perspectives. Notably, our method revealed differences in the intensity and time-dependency of PPI signals among different SL analogs with a range of hydrolyzabilities. In addition, we found that tolfenamic acid, an antagonist of the SL receptor, inhibited the SL-induced PPI but could not disrupt the already-formed signaling complex. The TR-FRET system was also used to rapidly and specifically detect naturally occurring SLs from root exudates containing many impurities. This work provides insights into the molecular mechanism of SL perception as well as a powerful tool for activity-based screening of SL signaling modulators.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Here we have assessed the role of the pyrenoid-associate protein LCI9 in starch sheath formation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using an lci9 mutant we assessed the role of LCI9 in starch sheath morphology by fluorescence and electron microscopy, and its impact on pCCM function by CO2 uptake and growth assays. We determined potential interactors of LCI9 via TurboID proximity labeling. In the absence of LCI9, cells fail to correctly assemble the starch sheath, have lower affinity for inorganic carbon and grow slower under CO2-limiting conditions. LCI9 localises to the starch sheath and is physically close to a range of starch metabolism enzymes and other potential scaffolding proteins. Finally, we show that LCI9 associates with starch in the land plant Arabidopsis thaliana. LCI9 likely acts as a pyrenoid specific scaffold for starch metabolism enzymes.

Earlier studies not only reported a low baseline Na+ concentration ([Na+]) in astrocytes, but also suggested an equilibration of [Na+] within the gap-junction-coupled syncytium. This is consistent with the view that the basic homeostatic properties of astrocytes are largely identical due to their critical role in brain function. Here, we used multi-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging for a quantitative determination of astrocytic [Na+] in mouse forebrain tissue slices and in vivo. Contrary to the prevailing notion of a rather uniform Na distribution, we detected a previously unobserved subcellular and cellular heterogeneity in astrocytic [Na+], accompanied by differences in the capacity for Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA)-mediated uptake of extracellular K+. Biophysical modelling showed that this heterogeneity can be replicated by the reported differential expression of NKA isoforms in astrocytes together with a different strength of Na+ influx over the plasma membranes. Altogether, our results thus suggest the existence of functionally distinct astrocytes and astrocyte subdomains in which Na+ homeostasis is locally adapted to the specific requirements of surrounding neural networks.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

This interaction simultaneously drives peripheral pain, making this pathway an attractive but complicated therapeutic target for chronic pain. By integrating single-molecule microscopy, structural and electrophysiology analyses, with a human NGF variant, NGFpainless, which retains neurotrophic effects but abolishes pain, we delineate the molecular mechanisms that bias TrkA signaling towards neurotrophic functions without triggering nociception. We show that, unlike wild-type NGF, NGFpainless fails to sensitize TRPV1 channels to capsaicin, thus disengaging TrkA from the nociceptive pathway. We further show that this selective loss of nociceptive TrkA signaling by NGFpainless results from its reduced ability to activate PLC{gamma}1 and trigger calcium release compared to NGF, while still preserving the ERK and AKT signaling essential for neurotrophic functions. This biased signaling arises from reduced electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless complex interface, which shortens the lifetime of this functional complex on native membranes. Mutations in TrkA that restore the electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless interface eliminate biased signaling. This mechanistic understanding of TrkA binding by NGFpainless, and how it differs from NGF, will spur the development of two therapeutic classes of molecules - one that selectively suppresses nociceptive signaling while preserving neurotrophic functions in chronic pain, and another that enhances neurotrophic activity without evoking peripheral pain in neurodegenerative conditions.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

We combined high-resolution adeno-associated viral tracing of callosal projections with comprehensive behavioral, histological, and molecular analyses. Nrg1 deletion led to significant impairments in structural connectivity and long-term motor recovery, which were markedly exacerbated in aged mice, indicating a critical role for Nrg1 in adult cortical repair. Mechanistically, our data indicated that Nrg1 promoted this plasticity through its intracellular domain (ICD) signaling, acting cell-autonomously to enhance axonal outgrowth. Furthermore, loss of Nrg1 was associated with altered structure of perineuronal-nets (PNN) and increased neuroinflammation at the lesion site.

Male and female C57BL/6J mice were treated with high-fat or low-fat diets to obtain mice with or without obesity. They were inoculated intranasally with a high (103) or low dose (101.5 TCID50) of mouse-adapted A/California/04/2009 H1N1 IAV and followed for 21 days post-infection (dpi) for morbidity. Subsets of mice were euthanized at different dpi to measure lung virus titers, histopathological changes, cellular infiltration, and cytokine induction. After a high-dose infection, females with obesity demonstrated shorter median survival time, greater parenchymal inflammation, and heightened induction of inflammatory markers than males with obesity. After a low-dose infection, females than males, and mice with obesity than the non-obese mice, exhibited severe morbidity. Female mice with obesity exhibited the greatest disease severity, where 25% (2/8) reached humane endpoint. Delayed but persistent inflammatory changes were observed in females with obesity, characterized by relatively lower pathological changes, lesser induction of cytokines and chemokines, and reduced myeloid and lymphoid infiltration in the lungs at 3 dpi followed by sustained pathological changes and cytokine and chemokine induction at 21 dpi. Our study suggests that the biological sex difference following IAV infection persists during obesity.

Linear (Met1-linked) ubiquitination, catalyzed by the E3 ligase complex LUBAC, was previously shown to participate in pyroptosis, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we show that Met1-linked ubiquitin chains can assemble during both priming and execution phases, independently of the inflammasome sensor NLRP3. Genetic deletion of the LUBAC enzymes or pharmacological inhibition impaired pyroptosis. Conversely, cell death was enhanced without the deubiquitinase OTULIN, which selectively removes linear ubiquitination. Finally, using an optogenetic model to bypass priming, we demonstrate that Met-1-linked ubiquitination is required for the execution phase of pyroptosis.

Cell extrusion is a highly conserved process that drives most epithelial cell death by seamlessly squeezing out excess live cells to maintain constant cell densities and a tight barrier. We discovered that healthy bronchial epithelia clear RV within 24 hours by selectively extruding infected cells, a process called virus-induced cell extrusion (VICE). In contrast, barrier-defective cells fail to clear the virus and accumulate infection. VICE occurs in two phases: an early wave triggered by mechanical signals, and a later wave dependent on viral replication. Although extrusion removes infection, virus-carrying expelled cells can still spread RV.

Methods: We used TTC/Evans blue-stained heart slice images of independent laboratories from previously published projects. Rat (n = 325 and 248 slices) and mouse (n = 77 slices) datasets were used to train deep learning segmentation models with three different neural network architectures, which were combined into a single AI analysis.

Measuring sexual dimorphism can help identify which traits have been shaped by sexual selection. While fish morphology has been widely described, fewer studies have quantified sexual dimorphism across all fin types: pectoral, pelvic, dorsal, anal, and caudal. Fins are often overlooked due to their small size, tendency to fold against the body, and poor preservation post-collection. In this study, we quantified sexual dimorphism in fin size and shape across all fin types in the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei. We found striking sexual dimorphism in the dorsal and anal fins, particularly in area, ray length, and base length. In contrast, the pelvic, pectoral, and caudal fins showed moderate, but detectable, levels of dimorphism. In both dorsal and anal fins, males exhibited elongation of the posterior region relative to females. Dorsal and anal fin traits (i.e., area, ray length, base length) were also strongly correlated within both sexes, such that individuals with larger than average dorsal fins also have larger than average anal fins. This correlation is present for both males and females, suggesting shared developmental pathways, pleiotropy, or correlated selection between dorsal and anal fins.

We also show that these biological findings are clinically relevant in heterozygous AAGGG expansion carriers, who display an increased risk and severity of neuropathy with platinum-based chemotherapy.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Conditional PV-specific Dnmt1 deletion combined with single-cell RNA-seq, in vivo electrophysiology, histology, and behavioral analyses revealed that loss of DNMT1 increases PV spiking activity but reduces inhibitory efficacy, leading to network desynchronization and depression- and anxiety-like behavior in mice. These physiological alterations were accompanied by broad, non-cell-autonomous transcriptional changes in astrocytes and oligodendroglial populations, prominently affecting pathways involved in perineuronal-net (PNN) organization and neuron-glia communication. Cell-cell interaction analyses revealed disrupted NRXN-NLGN, TNR-integrin, and semaphoring signaling, consistent with weakened perisomatic adhesion and PNN integrity.

The precise cellular distribution of opioid receptors within this region remains unclear. Using multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) and hierarchical cluster analysis, we mapped the expression of mu (Oprm), delta (Oprd), kappa (Oprk), and ORL1 (Oprl) opioid receptor genes at single-cell resolution in the mouse claustrum-dorsal endopiriform. Among 2,269 neurons analyzed, six transcriptional clusters were identified: three excitatory (CLA, CLA/OPRK, cortical excitatory) and three inhibitory (SST, PVALB, broad inhibitory). Oprk expression was uniquely restricted to excitatory claustrum neurons and particularly enriched in the CLA/OPRK cluster which was comprised largely of Synpr+ claustrum core projection cells. In contrast, Oprd, Oprm, and Oprl genes were more broadly distributed across both excitatory and inhibitory populations, with Oprd enriched in parvalbumin (Pvalb) inhibitory neurons and Oprl in somatostatin (Sst) inhibitory neurons. Spatial mapping confirmed that Oprk expressing cells were concentrated within the claustrum core, whereas other receptor subtypes extended across the entire claustrum and into adjacent cortical regions. A comparable distribution of opioid receptors was observed in the neighbouring dorsal endopiriform. Analysis of a publicly available single cell sequencing dataset of the macaque claustrum also revealed a similar receptor distribution, where Oprk expression was enriched within a subset of excitatory projection neurons, and Oprm,Oprd, and Oprl expressed widely in both inhibitory and excitatory cells. Together, these findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved, cell-type-specific organization of opioid receptor expression in the claustrum-dorsal endopiriform. These results indicate that kappa opioid receptor expression is a defining molecular feature of excitatory claustrum projection neurons and suggest distinct roles for other opioid receptors in modulating inhibitory and cortical circuits.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Experimentally observable deficits in memory can be ascribed to poor attentional focusing, human interference as well as age, sex, and dosing regimen. Stress and social isolation can also play a role during behavioral testing, particularly in small nonhuman social primates like marmosets that have been used widely. In this study, we examine the effects of scopolamine in marmosets under conditions of reduced stress, attentional distraction, and human interference. Using a custom designed home-cage touchscreen-based testing system, we investigated the influence of scopolamine on the performance on a visual associative learning task. During self-paced, voluntary testing, monkeys learned to discriminate pairs of complex visual patterns through trial and error by touching the stimulus associated with reward. Using this approach, we demonstrated over 75% discrimination accuracy in the eight marmosets tested (male and female) within three days of home-cage testing. Although the averaged data revealed no impact of acute or chronic scopolamine injections on learning, modeling the choice data with trial-level analysis revealed both age- and sex-specific deficits.

We integrate field flux measurements, ex situ biogeochemical assays, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics to determine ecosystem and cellular-level responses. Our results show that the oxidation of atmospheric CO and H2, but not CH4, increased with long-term warming due to higher cell numbers.

Quorum quenching (QQ) is the antagonistic disruption of this communication by competing organisms, with potential use in the ongoing human effort to control microbial populations. Previous studies have taken advantage of functional metagenomics to retrieve new QS/QQ genes, but the frequency of obtaining positive clones remained very low, suggesting the need for increased screening efficiency. Here, a new ultrahigh-throughput screening method was developed to search for genes encoding novel QQ genes based on functional metagenomics, microfluidics, and the development of an Escherichia coli reporter strain whose fluorescence is repressed in the presence of AHLs but restored by the expression of any gene that interferes with the QS system. This strain was transformed with a metagenomic short-insert library collected from Antarctic plant rhizospheres; an understudied extreme environment. The library was encapsulated in droplets containing single clones and sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). After screening approximately 7,000,000 clones, around 200 were recovered and one positive hit was confirmed, showing a previously unreported mode of action that would have been difficult to detect using rational computational methods. These findings underline the potential of microfluidics to dramatically increase screening efficiency, while reducing costs and processing time, and they act as a proof of concept for the discovery of more genes involved in QS and other molecular mechanisms of interest in microbial ecology.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that inhibition or depletion of human histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) regulates DSB repair by controlling the phosphorylation of H2AX, an early step of the DNA damage response.

Here, we performed Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) across a diverse European collection of F. vesca accessions. We identified multiple novel candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of diverse volatile esters, lactones, terpenoids, and methyl ketones. Among them, we characterized FvJMT2, a SABATH family methyltransferase which we found associated with natural variation in benzenoid esters content. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and strawberry fruit confirmed its role in methyl benzoate biosynthesis, while enzymatic assays demonstrated that FvJMT2 encodes a promiscuous enzyme capable of methylating not only benzoic acid, but also cinnamic, salicylic, and jasmonic acids. Behavioral assays revealed that methyl benzoate at physiologically relevant concentrations significantly reduced the attraction of Drosophila suzukii flies, supporting a dual role of this VOC in both flavor and pest deterrence. Finally, natural variation analyses in wild Fragaria species and F. x ananassa cultivars showed that benzenoid esters have been largely lost in modern cultivars but retained in ancient and wild accessions.

This plasticity is driven by a biphasic gene regulatory network switch that orchestrates large-scale reorganisation of the secretory machinery.

Although sex differences in influenza vaccine responses are studied in non-obese hosts, studies investigating sex differences in influenza vaccine-induced immunity and protection during obesity are limited. Materials and methods: Using the C57BL/6J mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity or low-fat diet controls, we investigated sex differences in influenza vaccine-induced immunity and protection during obesity. Male and female mice with or without obesity were vaccinated intramuscularly twice at a 3-week interval with an inactivated 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (IAV) vaccine. At 35 days post-vaccination (dpv), antibody responses in plasma and B- and T-cell responses in spleen and bone marrow were quantified. At 42 dpv, mice were intranasally challenged with a drift variant of the H1N1 IAV, and disease severity was assessed by monitoring the change in body mass up to 21 days post-challenge (dpc). Subsets of mice were euthanized at 3 dpc to determine pulmonary virus replication (TCID50 assay), histopathology (H&E staining), and cytokine/chemokine responses (multiplex ELISA). Results: Female mice, irrespective of diet and obesity status, developed higher antibody responses and were better protected compared to males. Vaccinated males with obesity mounted the poorest antibody responses, experienced a more severe disease, were unable to clear replicating virus from the lungs effectively, and demonstrated heightened pulmonary inflammation. Despite these differences, splenic B- and T-cell frequencies were comparable, suggesting the inefficiency of B cells to produce antibodies in males but not in females with obesity. Discussion: Our findings suggest that sex differences is observed in influenza vaccine-induced immunity and protection during obesity, where males are more severely affected.

The strategy of repeat shortening using genome editing tools is very attractive because a single intervention can result in permanent repair of the disease-causing mutation. However, a limited understanding of DNA repair mechanisms in repetitive sequences complicates the prediction and control of the editing effects. Using a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen, we identified pathways and factors responsible for the repair of staggered cuts generated by Cas12a within CAG repeat tracts. This analysis revealed a central role for interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair factors in mediating CAG repeat contraction, with DCLRE1A emerging as a key effector. We demonstrated that DCLRE1A recognizes and binds structures generated by Cas12a. Moreover, DCLRE1A interacts with SLX4, promoting the generation of pure contractions, and with POLI, leading to the formation of inverted repeats at the break site during template switching mechanisms. We then used this knowledge to increase the contribution of pure contractions to the pool of editing outcomes using fusions of Cas12a with DNA repair proteins. Our study indicates that Cas12a can be used as an effective tool for generating repeat contractions. Although the mechanisms leading to repeat shortening are complex, understanding them can help researchers develop more precise therapeutic strategies with greater control of the editing process.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we present an enhanced mathematical model of receptor motion during phagocytosis that explicitly incorporates the role of membrane tension. Further, we introduce a signalling component that is coupled to receptor dynamics via the membrane tension. We find that including tension results in fundamentally different engulfment behaviour, which is slower than that predicted by models without tension. In particular, unlike in the previous version of this model, we show that tension can lead to stalled engulfment, an experimentally-observed phenomenon known as frustrated phagocytosis. We also find that signalling is able to modify engulfment behaviour, especially at later stages, and is able to alter cup growth to become linear in time without the need for receptor drift as introduced in previous models.

To understand how these phenotypes evolve, it is essential to investigate the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, most comparative analyses of GRNs remain qualitative and are therefore sensitive to false positives and false negatives. RESULTS: To address this limitation, we introduce CroCoNet (Cross-species Comparison of Networks), an R package for the quantitative comparison of GRNs across species. CroCoNet constructs comparable network modules centered on known transcriptional regulators and quantifies the variability in module topology within and between species. By contrasting these levels of variability, CroCoNet can distinguish true evolutionary divergence from technical and biological confounders. Applying CroCoNet to scRNA-seq data from the early neural differentiation of human, gorilla, and cynomolgus macaque, we identified 20 conserved and 24 diverged modules. Despite the conserved expression pattern of the pluripotency factor POU5F1 (OCT4), its associated module was among the most diverged. This result was independently confirmed through cross-species CRISPRi perturbations coupled with single-cell RNA-seq as a readout. Moreover, we found that great ape- and human-specific LTR7 elements are enriched near POU5F1 module genes, potentially contributing to the cross-species differences in network topology. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that CroCoNet can resolve regulatory rewiring and provides a robust framework for studying GRN evolution across closely related species.

Cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that the Rps15 mutations destabilize the C-terminal Rps15 domain, affecting the translation elongation cycle dynamics, and deregulating accommodation of aminoacylated tRNAs at the ribosomal A-site. Using Ribo-seq and translation reporter assays, we show that this accommodation defect shows codon specificity, explaining the reduced translation efficiency of genes enriched for these codons in Rps15 mutant cells, such as histones. Notably, genes with reduced translation efficiency in Rps15 mutated cells were enriched for transcriptional regulators such as transcription factor Runx3, resulting in downregulation of Runx3 target genes involved in immune regulation. Altogether, this study provides a comparative map of the translational rewiring driven by the most frequent somatic RP mutations. We provide unprecedented mechanistic insights in the translation defects induced by CLL-associated Rps15 mutations, and reveal an unappreciated cross-talk between translational and transcriptional dysregulation in these RP mutant cells.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Recent work shows that early erythroid BFU-e and CFU-e progenitors form a developmental continuum characterized by gradual increase in the proportion of cells in S phase of the cycle. Here we proposed two distinct hypotheses to explain this finding, either the presence of quiescent progenitors or the gradual shortening of G1 and the cycle with differentiation. Using a mouse expressing a timer -protein transgene that reports cell cycle duration, we determined that, in vivo, early erythroid progenitors undergo orderly gradual shortening of the cycle as they mature and approach terminal differentiation. There was no evidence of quiescent BFU-e or CFU-e progenitors in tissue. We found that BFU-e and CFU-e progenitors are highly responsive to hypoxic stress and to its Epo and glucocorticoid mediators. Epo and hypoxia accelerated the pattern of gradual cell cycle shortening throughout early erythropoiesis, while conversely, dexamethasone prolonged the cycle specifically in proerythroblasts. Further, Epo and hypoxia generated rapid increase in early progenitor cell size and dynamic changes in cell surface marker expression. Our data suggest that high Epo or hypoxic stress promote rapid increase in the rate of growth in biomass across the entire erythroid trajectory including in the earliest BFU-e progenitors, and indicates that stress progenitors are of the same type and lineage as those sustaining basal erythropoiesis.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the influence of maternal capital (\"investment capacity\") on the growth and development of their infants in wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) from Laikipia, Kenya. We posit that maternal capital is influenced by a mother's own early life experiences (e.g., drought, maternal loss) and her current life experiences (e.g., dominance rank, food availability), and is signaled to offspring via maternal effort (i.e., nursing and carrying time) and glucocorticoids. We used behavioral data on 40 infants (43% female) in the first year of life to quantify maternal effort, infant play, and infant independence (i.e., frequency of infant departures from mother). We matched these behavioral data with maternal fecal glucocorticoid measures from lactating mothers, and infant growth measures assessed via photogrammetry. Signals of low maternal capital predicted lower rates of infant play, less behavioral independence, and slower growth. There was a negative relationship between the rate of social contact play and growth rate, indicating a developmental tradeoff. Males were more sensitive than females to some of the maternal signals measured in our study.

We defined distinct locomotor strategies that larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) use to control posture and navigate the water column in response to light and circadian cues. In the dark, larvae maintain balance by swimming in long bouts with large nose-up rotations, compensating for nose-down drift accrued during prolonged inactivity. Effective postural compensation requires vestibular sensation from the utricle. By contrast, in the light, larvae navigate with short, frequent, and variable bouts. While lighting exerts a dominant, masking effect on the locomotor strategies, circadian rhythms modulate the extent of each strategy.

Here, we report that exposure to the tryptophan metabolite kynurenine and its electrophilic derivative kynurenine-carboxyketoalkene (Kyn-CKA) leads to an increase in the abundance of transcription factor Nrf2 and induction of Nrf2-target genes, including NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), in murine and human cells. Additionally, both kynurenine and Kyn-CKA activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Using cellular thermal shift assays, we found that Kyn-CKA increases the thermal stability of Keap1-mCherry fusion protein, but not free mCherry, indicating target engagement of Keap1, the principal repressor of Nrf2. The use of purified recombinant BTB domain of Keap1 and its C151S mutant counterpart revealed that Kyn-CKA reacts with wild-type, but not C151S mutant, Keap1-BTB, and at a much faster rate than with the small molecule thiol N-acetyl cysteine, demonstrating Kyn-CKA is targeted to react with C151 by the surrounding protein environment. In close agreement, Kyn-CKA increased the abundance of Nrf2 and expression of NQO1 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells expressing wild-type Keap1, but its inducer potency was greatly diminished in C151S-Keap1 mutant MEFs. Experiments in WT, AhR-knockout, and Nrf2- knockout primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages showed that Nrf2 is required for the acute anti-inflammatory activity of Kyn-CKA, whereas AhR is dispensable.

Upon RNA virus infection, cytosolic Hsp90 recruits key innate immune signaling proteins to MAVS on mitochondria through its interaction with Tom70. To evade this innate immune response, the SARS-CoV-2 protein Orf9b binds to Tom70, thereby disrupting the Tom70-Hsp90 interaction and suppressing IFN production. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism underlying Orf9b-mediated inhibition of IFN signaling remains unclear. Here, using an integrative approach combining cryo-electron microscopy, 19F NMR spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that Orf9b inhibits Hsp90 binding to Tom70 through a bipartite mechanism. The helix and intrinsically disordered tail of Orf9b sterically block the access of two distinct structural units of Hsp90 to Tom70. We also find that Orf9b-mediated allosteric conformational changes in Tom70 do not contribute to the inhibition of the Hsp90 binding. Comprehensive structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic analyses further reveal that Orf9b primarily slows the association kinetics between Hsp90 and Tom70.

The pseudo serine/threonine kinase Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) is prominently expressed in melanoma tissue, promoting resistance to anti-cancer treatments and correlating with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Despite this understanding, the impact of TRIB2 expression on melanoma's metabolic profile remains unexplored. Here we use UACC-62 melanoma cells which exhibit substantial endogenous expression of TRIB2 as well as engineered isogenic TRIB2 knock out (KO) cells to assess the effect of the loss of TRIB2 on metabolism. Our findings reveal that TRIB2-KO cells display reduced glycolytic activity and heightened vulnerability to pharmacological inhibition of oxidative metabolism, contrasting with the parental cell line. These metabolic and phenotypic changes are driven by coordinated regulation of multiple glycolytic genes, whose combined effect might produce the glycolytic phenotype observed in parental cells.

Yet, experimental evidence for the PAA interaction site and importance for post-translational regulation are lacking. Here, we demonstrate the role of PAA for plant growth and bHLH104 regulation. Transgenic plants expressing a bHLH104 variant lacking the terminal PAA (b104^dPAA) have a constitutive Fe deficiency response. Strong accumulation of Fe causes b104^dPAA plants to have abnormal shoot and root development and delayed flowering, accompanied by mis-regulated Fe response and upregulated Fe acquisition genes. The severity of Fe accumulation phenotypes coincides with bHLH104 protein amounts. In plants, bHLH104 levels are controlled by proteasomal degradation in a PAA-dependent manner. Cell assays show that the PAA sequence is required for bHLH104 interaction with BTS and subsequent ubiquitination.

Here we present MitoFlare, a mitochondria-targeted, reversible mtROS-responsive fluorogenic probe that enables continuous, non-genetic visualization of mitochondrial oxidative activation and turnover. MitoFlare incorporates dual TEMPO nitroxide quenchers into a long-wavelength rhodamine scaffold, producing >95% basal quenching and rapid, fully reversible fluorescence activation in response to mitochondrial superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, lipid-derived peroxyl species, and peroxynitrite. When combined with LysoTracker Green, MitoFlare forms a dual-probe imaging platform that resolves the entire mitophagy cascade with high spatial and temporal fidelity in intact PC12 neuronal cells. Using this platform, we established a quantitative framework comprising three mechanistically distinct metrics: (i) a proximity index that reports early mitochondrial engagement with lysosomes, (ii) Mander's M1 coefficient that captures mid-stage mitochondria-lysosome fusion and mitophagosome formation, and (iii) a quenching/swelling index that resolves terminal lysosomal degradation. Nutrient deprivation induced a complete, temporally ordered mitophagy program, including mtROS priming, Parkin-OPTN-associated fusion, and efficient acidification-dependent cargo degradation. In contrast, inhibition of v-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 arrested mitophagy at the fusion stage, resulting in persistent redox-active mitochondrial cargo that failed to undergo lysosomal digestion. Importantly, MitoFlare's reversible redox chemistry uniquely revealed accumulation of undegraded, oxidatively active mitochondrial remnants within non-acidified vesicles-pathological intermediates that are undetectable using irreversible ROS dyes or genetically encoded reporters. These findings demonstrate that mitophagy proceeds through discrete, redox-regulated and lysosome-dependent phases that can be quantitatively mapped in real time. By enabling synchronized measurement of oxidative activation, organelle trafficking, fusion, and degradation, the MitoFlare-LysoTracker system establishes a new benchmark for dynamic mitophagy analysis in physiologically relevant models.

E.", "abstract": "Background: Complex spikes (CSs) in cerebellar Purkinje cells convey unique signals complementary to Simple spike (SS) action potentials, but are infrequent and variable in waveform. Their variability and low spike counts, combined with recording artifacts such as electrode drift, make automated detection challenging. New Method: We introduce CUSP (CS sorting via U-net Sequence Prediction), a fully automated deep learning framework for CS sorting in high-density multi-electrode array recordings. CUSP uses a U-Net architecture with hybrid self-attention inception blocks to integrate local field potential and action potential signals and outputs CS event probabilities in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Detected events are clustered and paired with concurrently detected SSs to reconstruct the complete Purkinje cell activity. Results: Trained on cerebellar neuropixels recordings in rhesus macaques, CUSP achieves human-expert performance (F1 = 0.83 +/- 0.03) and even captures valid CS events overlooked during manual annotation. Comparison with Existing Methods: CUSP outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art CS and SS sorting algorithms on CS detection. It remains robust to waveform variability, spikelet composition, and electrode drift, enabling accurate CS tracking in long-term recordings. In contrast, existing methods often show false-positive biases or degrade under drift. Conclusions: CUSP provides a scalable, robust framework for analyzing burst-like or dynamically complex spike patterns.

This circuit consists of the locomotor-initiator mushroom body output neurons, MBON09, and the locomotor-terminator MBON21. Previous locomotor initiation by default suppresses the propensity of future initiation through depression of MBON09 activity by locomotion-sensitive dopamine afferents, preventing redundant action. Locomotor persistence is promoted through combined inhibition of MBON21 by MBON09 and by distinct dopamine afferents that receive fluctuating motivational signals. Persistent locomotion under high motivational state, in turn, causes dopamine-dependent MBON09 facilitation, reinvigorating locomotor initiation program.

Here, we identify distinct but interacting neurocomputational mechanisms that support learning of multisensory associations. We designed a task in which behaviorally relevant information was available only from combinations of visual cues with either auditory or tactile cues. In 58 participants undergoing fMRI, we dissociated three processes: multisensory statistical learning (SL), modeled as stimulus-locked Shannon surprise; reinforcement learning (RL), modeled as feedback-locked signed reward prediction errors (RPEs); and feedback-locked unsigned RPEs (uRPEs), reflecting surprise about reward outcomes. Behaviorally, response times scaled with Shannon surprise (SL) while accuracy improved with feedback (RL). Model-based fMRI revealed dissociable but complementary networks: RPEs engaged ventral striatum, vmPFC, and left angular gyrus; surprise recruited bilateral angular gyrus, dlPFC, and precuneus; and uRPEs involved insula, dorsomedial prefrontal, and lateral frontoparietal cortices. Several of these regions are not typically implicated in unisensory studies, suggesting specialization for multisensory learning. All three networks were modality-general, i.e., they showed comparable strength for audiovisual and visuotactile learning. Notably, left angular gyrus tracked both Shannon surprise and RPE, identifying it as a potential hub for integrating structural and value information.

We and others have shown that one particular TE RNA, B2 SINE ncRNA, is a regulator in the rodent hippocampus, especially after a psychologically stressful event like acute restraint stress. It is unknown, however, if B2 SINE ncRNA is necessary for the proper development of hippocampal neurons, and furthermore, if there is a sex difference in this development. This work investigates the difference in expression of B2 SINE RNA across sexes and its role in the development of primary hippocampal neurons. We utilized pooled locked nucleic acid (LNA) GapmeRs to knock down the expression of B2 SINE RNA and treated primary hippocampal neurons with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to test if there is a difference in dendritic complexity. We used Sholl analysis to quantify the branching, number of tips, and Sholl mean. We found a sex difference in both B2 SINE, higher in males compared to females, and B-actin, lower in males compared to females. Additionally, knocking down B2 SINE RNA results in a reduction of dendritic complexity in male but not in female neurons. Taken together, this work suggests that B2 SINE RNA is expressed differentially and plays an important role in the proper development of hippocampal neurons in a sex dependent manner. Our findings support the identification of a sex-specific biomarker that may enable individualized treatment of conditions influenced by sex. This is the first evidence of the role a transposable element's RNA has in the regulation of the development of neurons and the first to show that differential regulation by sex.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Unbiased clustering identified four groups corresponding to slow (S), fast fatigue-resistant (FR), intermediate (FI), and fast fatigable (FF) types. A multinomial logistic regression model performed well, with most errors occurring between FI and FF types, which showed substantial overlap. Reducing the task to three classes improved accuracy. Feature selection revealed that four electrophysiological properties (input conductance, rheobase, AHP duration, maximal frequency) were sufficient for high predictive performance.

C.; Bronstein, A. M.; Ellmers, T. J.", "abstract": "Maintaining balance requires rapid integration of sensory input with top-down sensorimotor predictions. Predictive coding frameworks posit that mismatches between the two (prediction errors) drive perceptual inference. Although these frameworks have helped explain perception in unisensory domains (e.g., vision, touch), it remains unclear whether such mechanisms govern perception in fast-acting sensorimotor systems like human balance. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and discrete postural perturbations, we independently manipulated expectations and sensory input by priming healthy adult participants to expect either small or large perturbations, while occasionally delivering expectancy-violating perturbations (i.e., perturbations were smaller or larger than expected). Subjective perception of instability was shaped by expectation alone, regardless of actual sensory input (i.e., perturbation magnitude). Similarly, both anticipatory pre-perturbation beta-band suppression and post-perturbation sensorimotor gamma increases were sensitive to expected perturbation magnitude. In contrast, both the balance N1 (a well-established stimulus-evoked cortical potential) and the objective postural responses of instability tracked actual perturbation magnitude alone. Crucially, neither perception, nor any of these early (commonly analysed) neural or behavioural markers, encoded prediction errors. These findings suggest that two distinct systems exist: one that is sensitive to top-down expectations and another that is driven by sensory input, independent of expectation or mismatches. These findings challenge the centrality of prediction error as a driver of perception in fast sensorimotor systems such as postural control, and offer insight into conditions marked by distorted bodily awareness during balance.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

While prior work has shown that categories can be decoded from distributed activity patterns in auditory cortex, it remains unclear how these categories are globally arranged relative to one another, and how low-level acoustic and higher-level semantic structure jointly shape this organisation. Here, we addressed these questions by deriving low-dimensional functional gradients from high-depth functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (three participants, ~4.7 hours each) acquired during a category-specific one-back task. These gradients captured the principal axes of population activity in auditory cortex. Gradient-based models of the auditory cortex explained category structure more accurately than region-of-interest or whole-brain approaches, revealing that category information is distributed across multiple continuous axes rather than aligned with any single organisational dimension. Projecting acoustic (gammatone filter-bank) and behavioural similarity spaces directly into a shared framework with the fMRI functional axes showed that both contribute to the brain's category geometry, with acoustic structure exerting a somewhat stronger influence. However, representational relationships varied across category pairs: some reflected primarily acoustic similarity, others semantic distinctions, and many a combination of both. This pairwise heterogeneity shows how auditory cortex may integrate multiple representational dimensions that define higher-level categories.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Y.", "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDS) encompass a heterogeneous set of metabolic disorders caused by defects in enzymes responsible for maintaining mitochondrial nucleotide pools and genome integrity. Among these, deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) acts within the mitochondrial purine-salvage pathway and loss-of-function mutations give rise to DGUOK deficiency, a severe hepatocerebral form of MDS marked by liver failure, neurodevelopmental impairment, and systemic metabolic inflammation. Although the clinical manifestations of DGUOK deficiency have been primarily ascribed to defective mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, some patients exhibit hepatic steatosis and inflammation despite preserved mtDNA content, suggesting that DGUOK deficiency may deregulate additional metabolic and immune pathways. Here we show that DGUOK depletion reprograms hepatocellular metabolism and innate immune signaling through a purine-dependent mechanism operating independently of mtDNA depletion. In human hepatocellular carcinoma hepatocytes (HEPG2) subjected to siRNA-mediated DGUOK silencing, mitochondrial architecture and respiration remained intact but cells exhibited pronounced lipid droplet accumulation and a robust cell-intrinsic innate immune type I interferon response. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed widespread transcriptional reprogramming, including upregulation of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), suppression of lipid metabolic pathways, and changes in purine, methionine, and methylation-associated gene networks. Perturbing purine homeostasis through deoxyadenosine (dAdo) supplementation in wild-type cells phenocopied DGUOK disruption, causing global DNA hypomethylation and activation of viral mimicry pathways. Together, these findings identify DGUOK as a central regulator of the purine-regulated lipid-immune axis in hepatocytes, demonstrating that mitochondrial nucleotide salvage preserves hepatic immune and metabolic homeostasis beyond its canonical role in mtDNA synthesis. By linking purine imbalances to steatosis and type I interferon activation, this study establishes a mechanistic framework for immunometabolic pathology in DGUOK deficiency.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Antibiotic-induced bacterial dysbiosis has been linked to impaired neutrophil bactericidal activity and to intestinal commensal bacteria escape during systemic candidiasis, though it remains unclear whether receipt of antibacterial antibiotics impairs neutrophil-dependent defenses against inhaled mold pathogens in the lung. Herein, we measured the outcome of Aspergillus challenge in C57BL/6J mice that were treated with different antibiotics in the drinking water for three weeks prior to experimental infection. We found that ampicillin but not neomycin or vancomycin treatment significantly increased murine mortality and lung fungal burden. The heightened susceptibility was associated with impaired fungal killing by lung-infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes, as well as reduced neutrophil production of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Loss of these modifications alters protamine-DNA interactions in vitro and in vivo, compromising sperm chromatin integrity and impairing fertility. Therefore, these findings demonstrate that protamines do not merely serve as inert packaging proteins; rather protamine PTMs establish functional heterogeneity within sperm chromatin, creating compartment-like domains analogous to those in somatic cells.

The molecular sequence that unfolds downstream of HIPPO pathway inactivation, linking human trophectoderm specification to the early organization of the chorion, has remained unknown. Here, we establish a developmentally informed model that leverages HIPPO pathway modulation to induce the native trophectoderm trajectory in the absence of exogenous BMP or WNT signaling. We first transiently reset primed human pluripotent stem cells into a trophectoderm-competent ground state, followed by LATS kinase inhibition to set the trajectory in motion. To benchmark fidelity, we built an embryo-chorion single-cell reference integrating published early human and placental transcriptomes and applied a computational stage-matching tool to align our cultures to natural development. Stage matching revealed an ordered progression along the trophectoderm trajectory from early TE to post-implantation trophoblast. With extended culture, all major cell types of the nascent chorion emerged, encompassing both trophoblast and chorionic mesoderm lineages. Within the trophoblast, we identified proliferative and non-cycling villous cytotrophoblast, a columnar population connecting villous and extravillous domains, as well as syncytia and extravillous subtypes. When cultured in suspension, these lineages self-organized into three-dimensional organoids that recapitulated the stromal-epithelial architecture and proliferative-syncytial polarity of the emergent chorion. We identified CLDN6 as a defining surface marker of columnar trophoblast, the population that bridges villous and extravillous compartments. Prospective isolation of living CLDN6+ trophoblast revealed their capacity to reacquire a proliferative villous state and, under directed cues, generate both syncytial and extravillous fates, confirming their proposed dual developmental potential within the chorion.

Live imaging and quantitative flow analysis reveal that these rotations are maintained over ~200 m, suggesting long-range mechanical coupling between dorsal and ventral tissues. High-resolution confocal microscopy shows fibronectin and laminin fibrils radiating ventrally from the blastopore in spoke-like arrays between ectoderm and mesoderm. Perturbations of cell proliferation, radial intercalation, and mediolateral intercalation fail to abolish these flows, whereas targeted disruption of ventral extracellular matrix integrity severely impairs rotational movement.

However, understanding the context-specific community assembly mechanisms that underlie these changes requires a mechanistic understanding of plant responses. Here, we use functional traits and diversity indices to identify distinct responses of warm- and cold-adapted forest communities. Location: New Zealand Time period: 1970 to 2019 Major taxa studied: 139 woody plant species (trees, shrubs, lianas). Methods Our analysis used seven traits, including leaf morphology, size, nutrient content, and foliar isotopes across 3,625 sites over 49 years. We derived functional strategies from community-weighted mean trait values, assessed assembly mechanisms using five multi-trait functional diversity indices, and estimated structural change and turnover rates using abundance-based dissimilarity metrics. Results Forest composition shifted significantly towards warm-adapted, lowland species with increasing temperature (+0.12 C/decade) and decreasing precipitation (0.87%/decade). Communities concurrently increased in functional and species richness, but became functionally more similar, indicating niche packing. Disturbance recruitment shifted warm-adapted forests towards acquisitive traits, and increases in anisohydric strategies, reflecting possible effects of CO2 fertilisation under drought stress. Cold-adapted forests, in contrast, shifted to conservative strategies and were subject to stronger abiotic filtering. Moreover, changes in nitrogen isotope ratios point towards the importance of ectomycorrhizal associations to persist under climate change. Ecotonal mixed forests showed both responses and experienced the highest turnover.

We obtained local field potentials (LFP) from the frozen brain regions under non-depolarized (high external NaCl) and depolarized (high external KCl) saline solutions, observing spontaneous oscillations under both conditions. The electrical oscillations of the brain tissue had different amplitudes in the absence (0 mV) or presence (100 mV) of holding potential and were inhibited by the MT stabilizer paclitaxel. A frequency domain spectral analysis of the time records revealed the presence of two major peaks at approximately ~38 Hz and ~93 Hz in both preparations. However, the energy contribution of each peak was different in the hippocampus compared to neocortex. Coupled with our electron microscopy observations, these data suggest that rat brain MTs produce electrical oscillations with specific properties in the various regions of the mammalian brain, which could be partially related as their intra-axonal distributions.

Combining comparative anatomy across 130 mammal species with ancestral-trait reconstruction, multimodal imaging, and physics-based transport modelling, we show that the human umbilical cord structure is uncommon in other mammals and that the ancestral umbilical cord was unspiralled, with three vessels and an allantoic duct. Across species, vessel number and cord length correlate with birth weight: four-vessel cords and the persistence of an allantoic duct occur in species with heavier neonates, while two-vessel cords are confined to small muroid rodents. Mathematical modelling predicts that oxygen delivery remains near maximal across all cord architectures, but placental heat removal depends strongly on umbilical flow, and moderately on cord length and coiling. Scaling of umbilical flow with birth weight implies that larger species approach near-maximal heat-removal capacity, while smaller species are less efficient. Finally, three-dimensional imaging of the human cord reveals a triple-helix configuration of umbilical vessels, rather than arteries simply twisting around a central vein. This, and other observed cross-sectional vessel configurations in mammals and atypical human cords, aligns with theoretically predicted arrangements that minimize inter-vessel shunting, supporting an adaptive role for cord geometry in thermal regulation function.

Prior studies have shown that speech-related functional coactivation--simultaneous high-gamma augmentation across distributed regions--reflects underlying neural interactions, as validated by electrical stimulation mapping. However, it remains unclear at the whole-brain level when, for how long, and in which directions cortical regions transmit information, and how dynamic information flows contribute to speech. Here, we investigated the causal roles of directional neural information flow during auditory and visual naming using intracranial EEG from 9,526 artifact-free nonepileptic sites across 127 patients. Information flow, estimated by transfer entropy-based effective connectivity, was classified as excitatory when high-gamma acceleration in one region predicted subsequent acceleration in another, and inhibitory when deceleration predicted downstream deceleration. Following stimulus onset, excitatory flows emerged from modality-specific sensory cortices and propagated to higher-order regions, later becoming bidirectional as functional coactivation developed. Each excitatory flow event was transient (<500 ms), typically followed by inhibitory flows and decreased coactivation, during which excitatory flows often emerged along new pathways. During auditory naming, faster response times were associated with stronger excitatory flows in left perisylvian regions; during visual naming, faster responses were linked to stronger flows in bilateral basal temporal cortices. Stronger excitatory flows at specific time points predicted a higher probability of stimulation-induced symptoms (Spearman's rho: 0.54 - 0.81; p<0.00001), whereas associations with inhibitory flows peaked later. Excitatory flows near visual naming response onset were particularly associated with stimulation-induced speech arrest and face sensorimotor symptoms, whereas functional coactivation alone failed to reveal comparable associations. These findings demonstrate that transient acceleration of directional neural interactions through white matter supports successive stages of speech processing. As activity within one pathway decelerates, excitatory flow accelerates along another, enabling functional transitions critical for naming. By establishing the causal contribution of temporally precise, anatomically specific white matter pathways, this study substantiates and extends existing neurobiological models of speech.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined how healthy adults and individuals with peripheral nerve injury (PNI) in their dominant hand performed a visually guided drawing task with each hand. We hypothesized that the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) supports drawing with either hand, and that individuals with PNI would recruit the same mechanisms as healthy adults. Methods: 33 Right-handed adults (23 healthy adults, 10 patients) underwent fMRI while performing a precision drawing task, alternating between the right hand (RH) and left hand (LH). LH>RH effects were examined across 20 regions of interest (12 a priori, 8 post hoc) using two approaches: (1) BOLD magnitude, and (2) functional connectivity (FC) modulation, assessed via generalized psychophysiological interaction. Results: All effects describe LH drawing > RH drawing. Right primary motor cortex (M1) had lower magnitude and greater FC with two networks, both of which exhibited equal-or-greater magnitude: a left hemisphere M1-dorsal premotor circuit, and an intrahemispheric parieto-temporal circuit. Right M1 (also had reduced interhemispheric FC with inferior parietal lobule, which exhibited lower magnitude. Patient group had no effect on magnitude or FC. Conclusions: Three neural mechanisms differentiate LH from RH drawing in right handed adults. First, a left hemisphere system for bimanual control, which engages intrahemispherically (directly) during RH drawing but interhemispherically (indirectly) during LH drawing. Second, LH drawing increases engagement of a contralateral system that may reflect increased task demands. Third, RH drawing increases engagement of an interhemispheric circuit for tool use. The first and third systems may explain performance asymmetries associated with handedness. Patients with PNI use the same mechanisms as healthy adults, highlighting these mechanisms' potential as a neuromodulatory target to enhance LH performance after RH impairment.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

K.; Dixit, M.", "abstract": "FRG1 acts as a molecular double-edged sword: while its overexpression is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), its under expression activates tumorigenic signalling pathways--highlighting the importance of tightly regulated FRG1 levels. Although prior studies have hinted at FRG1's involvement in RNA biogenesis, its core molecular functions have remained largely elusive. Our previous work identified FRG1 as a transcriptional regulator of genes in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway; however, the underlying mechanisms were not fully delineated. In this study, using a range of cellular models with altered FRG1 expression, we demonstrate that reduced FRG1 levels enhance NMD activity. We reveal that FRG1 is a structural component of both the spliceosome and the exon junction complex (EJC), and that it directly modulates NMD by interacting with UPF1--regulating its ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we show that DUX4 inversely regulates the NMD machinery through FRG1, establishing a critical molecular axis. Despite its structural association with the EJC and spliceosome, the absence of FRG1 does not compromise the integrity of these complexes. Polysome profiling showed that FRG1 co-sediments with eIF4A3, a core EJC component, across translating ribosomal fractions. This interaction was further supported by proximity ligation assays confirming the close spatial proximity of FRG1 and eIF4A3. Importantly, we validated the impact of FRG1 perturbation on NMD efficiency and UPF1 levels in vivo using a transgenic FRG1 knockout zebrafish model. Together, these findings establish a direct, DUX4-independent role for FRG1 in regulating the NMD pathway and uncover a previously unrecognized function for FRG1 in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Our work provides mechanistic insight into FRG1's molecular roles and lays the groundwork for therapeutic strategies targeting diseases associated with its dysregulation.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The kidney develops an osmotic gradient, up to 1300 mOsm, to drive the reabsorption of water. However, this creates a harsh environment for renal epithelial and immune cells. These cells need to develop a survival mechanism to prevent against osmotic stress and maintain homeostasis in this harsh environment. Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 5 (NFAT5, also known as Tonicity-Responsive Enhancer-Binding Protein factor or TonEBP) is a master transcription factor that responds to changes in osmolarity, regulating the transcription of genes that control the intracellular accumulation of osmolytes. Studies suggest that NFAT5 may be responsible for cell survival in this environment. Both epithelial and immune cells play a role in pro-inflammatory responses and disease progression. Additionally, NFAT5 may also play divergent roles, promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in immune cells, and anti-inflammatory genes in epithelial cells. We hypothesized that NFAT5 expression was protective in epithelial cells, while stimulation in immune cells may be proinflammatory. We performed survival assays to assess an NFAT5-dependent role in hyperosmolar environments. We also assessed gene expression and identified targets that may be responsible for cell survival, as well as demonstrating divergent mechanisms in epithelial and immune cells. In conclusion, we found NFAT5 is critical to cell survival in hyperosmolar environments and identified transcripts such as bgt1, aqp1 and akr1b3 that may explain the difference in survival. We also observed a difference in expression between epithelial and raw cells, including the same targets thought to protect against hyperosmotic stress in IMCD3 cells that showed differential regulation by NFAT5. These data suggest a divergent NFAT5 mechanism in two cell types present in the kidney.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we present PETRA (Prime Editing of Transcribed Regulatory elements to Assay expression), a multiplexed genome editing method to quantify the effects of regulatory variants at scale. PETRA leverages the delivery of variants to abundantly transcribed regions of genes such that sequence-specific effects on mRNA expression can be read out by amplicon sequencing. We demonstrate PETRA in Jurkat cells by scoring 13,935 six-nucleotide insertions delivered to the 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) of four genes important for T cell responses, namely VAV1, IL2RA, CD28 and OTUD7B. Effects on expression are linked to the creation of new transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), as well as to alterations in splicing and translation initiation. Combinatorial delivery of TFBSs identified using PETRA enables the discovery of alleles that increase mRNA expression more than 10-fold. Lastly, we extend PETRA to primary human T cells and compare variant effects across cell types. These experiments establish PETRA as a flexible means of dissecting the logic of gene regulation across genomic contexts and cell types.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Through genome mining, we identified a conserved biosynthetic gene cluster within Pseudomonadota encoding one such family, the multinuclear nonheme iron-dependent oxidative enzymes (MNIO, formerly DUF692). Using a representative gene cluster from Fontimonas thermophila, we heterologously produced the post-translationally modified peptide fontiphorin, and detailed spectral analysis revealed MNIO-catalyzed installation of seven 5-thiooxazole (5TO) moieties. During our work, additional MNIO products were reported with conflicting structural assignments, so we investigated the related biosynthetic gene clusters from Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Using alkylation-assisted HMBC correlations, we demonstrated that these products also contain 5TO resulting in a revision of the structure of oxazolin. We further provide evidence supporting a role for 5TO-containing peptides in copper detoxification and recommended this emerging class of Cu-associated peptidic thiooxazole metallophores be referred to as captophorins. To further explore the captophorins, we reconstituted fontiphorin biosynthesis in vitro and investigated its enzymatic requirements. Using cell-free production of single-site, double-site, and naturally occurring variants, we examined enzyme-substrate interactions to determine key sites governing catalysis by 5TO-forming MNIOs.

However, the functional role of MT oscillations in the physiology of brain function remains unknown. Acute dehydration (DH) induced by water restriction results in changes in osmolality that require the modification of osmosensitive neuronal activity in the regions of the CNS involved in osmoregulation, in particular magnocellular neurons from the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON), responsible for the release of vasopressin and implicate osmosensor channels, associated with an intricate mesh of MTs. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of 24 h water deprivation (DH, dehydrated group) on the MT-based cytoskeleton of adult Wistar rats, as compared to a control group with free access to water (Control, euhydrated group). We obtained local field potentials (LFP) from isolated SON and cortex (CTX) brain tissue, observing spontaneous oscillations under both conditions. The electrical oscillations of the brain tissue from DH animals had different amplitudes and frequency peaks as compared to controls. A frequency domain spectral analysis of the time records indicated specific, SON-associated MT energy contributions of the frequency peaks in the challenged group, most particularly a dramatic increase in the 10-20 Hz range, and a statistically significant reduction in the high frequency 83-100 Hz region, not observed in the CTX samples. The data indicate that brain MTs respond to dehydration to produce electrical oscillations with distinct properties in the areas of the mammalian brain that specifically contribute to the homeostatic response. The present study provides the first evidence for a novel physiological mechanism associated with the electrical activity of the neuronal cytoskeleton and points to its possible involvement in the brain osmoregulatory mechanism.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Magnetic bioprinting was used to assess cells' migration/metastatic potential in response to fucoidan exposure. Cellular viability was assessed using a cytotoxicity lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. nCounter (Nanostring) assays were used for microRNA and mRNA profiling in control and treated cells. Fucoidan treated PC-3 spheroids clearly showed a dose dependent viability/migration response and changes in spheroid structural morphology. Fifty-seven genes were significantly differentially expressed between fucoidan treated and non-treated PC-3 spheroids. No miRNAs at an adjusted p-value were significantly differentially expressed in PC-3 spheroids with fucoidan co-culture. Thirty-two genes were significantly differentially expressed in the fucoidan treated to non-treated LNCaP spheroids and there was a significant 3.5-fold (pAdj=0.012) increase in hsa-miR-1246 in the fucoidan treated compared to non-treated LNCaP spheroids.

Arrest of the outgrowth, as seen in Shh-null mouse embryos, causes bladder agenesis and unexpected severe defect of the umbilical arteries, suggesting that the outgrowth epithelial signal Shh coordinates development of both the bladder and umbilical arteries. Wnt2 signaling molecule is restricted to the rostral outgrowth mesenchyme; and its expression is dramatically down-regulated in Shh-null mutants. Furthermore, Wnt2-null mutants develop small bladder and single umbilical artery defects. Findings here uncover an unexpected co-development mechanism of the bladder and umbilical arteries orchestrated by the cloacal outgrowth signals.

We find that gene-torpor associations are highly clade-specific, with no gene being able to explain the majority of torpor shifts across the phylogeny of placental mammals. Instead, a relatively higher but limited extent of evolutionary convergence can be detected at the pathway level.

We show that this process generates a predictable collective behaviour in DNA methylation landscapes: at CpG sites that faithfully transmit their allelic methylation status across cell divisions, methylation proportions shift toward discrete values (0%, 50%, or 100%) as clones expand. We demonstrate this phenomenon in clonal hematopoiesis, in which a hematopoietic stem cell acquires a fitness-conferring mutation that leads to clonal expansion. Exploiting these dynamics, we developed COMET (Clonal Observation from METhylation), which quantifies clonal burden from bulk methylation data without prior knowledge of driving mutations. Validation against targeted sequencing demonstrated robust prediction across mutation types, accurate longitudinal tracking, and detection of sequencing artifacts. Applied to 15,900 individuals, COMET-predicted clonal hematopoiesis replicated known genetic associations (TCL1A, NRIP1) and phenotypic relationships with smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

V.; Deng, Y.", "abstract": "Fasting blood uridine is increased in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the significance of hepatic uridine biosynthesis to the etiology of both remains elusive. We found that de novo pyrimidine synthesis in the liver is reduced by fasting and diet-induced obesity, while suppression of hepatic pyrimidine synthesis promotes obesity and insulin resistance. The metabolic sequalae of hepatic pyrimidine synthesis suppression, however, is not associated with altered plasma uridine concentration. Instead, it is associated with an increased hepatic glucose production and a decreased hepatic insulin clearance, two key functions of hepatocytes in regulating systemic energy homeostasis. We found that enhanced gluconeogenesis is the primary reason for increased hepatic glucose production. Moreover, uridine, which was maintained stable in the circulation by adipose tissue and the liver, preferentially shut down pyrimidine synthesis in hepatocytes but not adipocytes at blood concentrations that occur with fasting. Remarkably, uridine, at fasting levels, increases gluconeogenesis further in hepatocytes when de novo pyrimidine synthesis is suppressed, indicating a synergistical action of uridine and its biosynthesis pathway in promoting hepatic glucose production, a mechanism highly relevant to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in obesity. Theologically, maintenance of blood uridine within the narrow range protects mammals from high-rate spontaneous tumorigenesis. Since obesity promotes an increase in blood uridine from adipocytes, suppressing uridine synthesis in hepatocytes becomes a critical response to lower spontaneous tumorigenesis. Pyrimidine synthesis suppression in hepatocytes, however, promotes gluconeogenesis and ultimately triggers obesity and T2D. These findings suggest a new paradigm for the etiology of metabolic deterioration in diet-induced obesity, in which perturbations in uridine promotes obesity and T2D.", "date": "2025-11-18", "journal": ""}

Electroporation can be applied to any cell type, yet identification of a working protocol for new organisms remains bespoke and laborious because no systematic framework exists, and appropriate instrumentation is lacking. Here, we describe an automated high-throughput platform which uses active learning to discover electroporation protocols for non-model microbes. We first devised a 24-condition electroporation screen, based on systematic evaluation and selection of key parameters, that can be applied to any microbe. Facilitated by a custom-built fully-programmable electroporator, we successfully identified electroporation protocols for eight non-model bacteria using this screen alone. We then combined this electroporation screen with our pooled POSSUM plasmid library to simultaneously evaluate 408 experimental conditions per organism and identified both a protocol and a replicating plasmid for five non-model Proteobacteria spanning three major classes (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-). We report the first electroporation protocols for Shewanella indica, Shewanella putrefaciens 200, Shewanella putrefaciens 95, Halomonas elongata, Piscinibacter sakaiensis, and Duganella zoogloeoides, as well as multiple alternative protocols for Shewanella amazonensis, Shewanella oneidensis, Azospirillum brasilense, Cupriavidus necator, Pseudomonas alcaliphila, and Escherichia coli.

No effective therapy specifically targets this dysfunction. Phosphorylation of troponin I by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) promotes relaxation, but global PKA activation affects numerous downstream targets. Here we investigated whether selective enhancement of troponin I phosphorylation could improve relaxation without widespread PKA activation. Methods: To investigate cAMP signalling with subcellular resolution we used real-time detection of cAMP levels and FRET based genetically encoded reporters targeted to specific locations combined with biochemical and genetic approaches. We applied peptide array technology to study protein-protein interaction surfaces and develop a protein-protein interaction disruptor peptide. The impact of such peptide on cardiac myocyte function was investigated in vitro, using both mouse and human primary cardiac myocytes and biochemical approaches, real-time imaging, work-loop analysis. In vivo analysis involved echocardiography and hemodynamics measurements. Results: We discovered that the cAMP-hydrolysing enzyme PDE4D9 binds troponin I and locally degrades cAMP within a nanometre-scale domain, thereby selectively regulating troponin I phosphorylation. The association of PDE4D9 with troponin I is markedly increased in cardiac disease in rodents and humans. A peptide displacing PDE4D9 from troponin I selectively elevates troponin I phosphorylation, enhances cardiomyocyte relaxation, and prevents diastolic dysfunction in a mouse heart failure model.

The data indicate that most reptile species have been evaluated by IUCN Red List specialist groups, although many assessments are outdated. Furthermore, there is a significant delay in local species assessments. We also observed that species richness is highest in the Amazonian region, followed by the Pacific-Andean transition. Interestingly, these richness distribution patterns do not necessarily align with the areas where most threatened and endemic species are found. Specifically, our analysis identifies the Andean region as harboring the greatest number of endemic and threatened species, as well as exhibiting high turnover and phylogenetic endemism. Regarding phylogenetic patterns, we found that threatened species contribute significantly to evolutionary history. However, threatened categories do not exhibit a phylogenetic pattern beyond what would be expected by chance.

Previously, differences in blood pressure elevation and sensitivity to dietary sodium were found to be less profound in female Eln+/- mice. Here, we determined whether ovarian hormones play a role in sex-related difference in blood pressure elevation resulting from Eln haploinsufficiency. Female Eln+/+ and Eln+/- mice instrumented with radiotelemetry devices were subjected to sham surgery or ovariectomy (OVX). We found that OVX lowered diastolic but not systolic blood pressure (SBP) in Eln+/- mice, resulting in increased pulse pressure. In Eln+/- mice, diuresis induced by acute volume expansion was blunted, while anti-natriuresis was exaggerated. Furthermore, amiloride lowered SBP and increased urinary Na+ excretion, suggesting that Eln+/--induced hypertension may be Na+-dependent. We conclude that increased Na+ and water retention by the kidney contribute to hypertension resulting from Eln haploinsufficiency.
