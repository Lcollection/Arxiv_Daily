Accordingly, circulating EVs and their associated molecules, such as RNAs and proteins, are regarded as promising sources of molecular biomarkers for various disorders. Cell culture-derived EVs have also drawn substantial attention as possible delivery tools for therapeutic molecules. Nevertheless, the biological impact of circulating EVs on in vivo physiology and pathology remains elusive. Here we report that systemic exposure to blood circulating EVs from wild-type (WT) mice attenuates sociability deficits in Rag1-/- mice. Intravenously injected WT mouse blood EVs reach the brain and restore postsynaptic inhibitory signals in the Rag1-/- medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) pyramidal neurons. Mechanistically, WT EV-associated microRNAs, miR-23a-3p and miR-103-3p, reduce PKC{varepsilon} expression, increasing postsynaptic GABAA receptors in the mPFC pyramidal neurons. Our findings reveal a sociability-promoting effect of blood circulating EVs and associated miRNAs with therapeutic potential for sociability deficits.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

A.; Hawi, Z.", "abstract": "Although the gene DUSP6 has been implicated as a risk gene for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in recent GWAS studies, its functional role in the aetiology of the condition remains poorly understood. DUSP6 is reported to regulate dopaminergic neurotransmission by decreasing available synaptic dopamine, suggesting a potential mechanism by which DUSP6 may confer risk to ADHD. In this study, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 to generate isogenic iPSC lines from an individual with ADHD, including heterozygous and homozygous DUSP6 knockouts alongside the parental control. These iPSC lines were differentiated into dopaminergic neurons and assessed at both cellular, and transcriptomic levels. We observed significant increase in extracellular dopamine in proportion to DUSP6 gene dosage, with greater elevation in homozygous compared to heterozygous knockouts. RNA sequencing further supported this finding, showing that DUSP6-knockout increased expression of genes regulating dopamine secretion and synaptic processes critical for dopaminergic system. Beyond dopamine signalling, transcriptomic changes implicated DUSP6 in neurodevelopmental biological mechanisms, essential to the development of ADHD. Furthermore, we identified significant overlaps between DUSP6-regulated genes and those associated with major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, suggesting shared genetic pathways potentially influenced by DUSP6. This study provides mechanistic insights into the role that DUSP6 could potentially play in the aetiology of ADHD and its broader implications across related neuropsychiatric conditions.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is implicated in these processes, yet its precise role in action monitoring versus outcome tracking remains unclear. To investigate this, we developed a novel discrimination-avoidance task for mice, designed with clear temporal separation between actions and outcomes. Our findings show that ACC neurons primarily encode post-action variables over extended periods, reflecting the animal's preceding actions rather than the outcomes or values of those actions. Specifically, we identified two distinct subpopulations of ACC neurons: one encoding the action state (whether an action was taken) and the other encoding the action content (which action was taken). Importantly, increased post-action ACC activity was associated with better performance in subsequent trials. These findings suggest that the ACC supports complex associative learning through extended signaling of rich action-relevant information, thereby bridging cue, action, and outcome associations.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

In this study, in silico characterization of pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP) protein was performed by utilizing sequence analysis, structure prediction, and molecular modeling studies, revealing its potential role in bypassing the loss of transaldolase. The findings suggest how PFP and fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBPA) can reconstruct the disrupted central carbon metabolism and indirectly help CLas in ATP production. The molecular dynamics studies and free energy calculations of PFP-complexes showed binding affinity towards fructose 6-phosphate and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, showing its dual function. The sequence-based analysis and metabolic modeling study also highlight the presence of other alternate enzymes or transport proteins in CLas, elucidating the broader metabolic resilience.

We propose an individual-based model that captures these MOI-dependent dynamics phenomenologically. The model takes into account the development of LO resistance (LOR) after the primary infection, and LIN is modelled by a fixed average delay in latent period per secondary adsorption with stochastic variability. The model successfully reproduces the experimentally observed multiple peaks in phage production following controlled phage addition. We extend the model to simulate batch culture growth and demonstrate that synchronized collapse of LINed culture can emerge as a collective phenomenon when LOR cells have a high, but finite, LO threshold (LOR cell lysis from withOut, LORO). Finally, we apply the model to a spatially structured bacterial colony under phage attack. We find that, if the burst size is comparable to the LO thresholds, especially LORO may play a role in colony survival due to locally elevated MOI near lysing cells.

Although call timing and wingbeat synchrony have been described across many behavioural contexts, it remains unclear when such coordination is temporally feasible and when it must necessarily break down. Here, I develop a constraint-based analysis that formalises how temporal feasibility limits shape behavioural coordination during active echolocation. Building on the responsivity framework, the model explicitly represents the ordering and timing dependencies between call emission, echo delay, sensory processing, and subsequent action, and derives conditions under which call timing can remain phase-locked to a cyclic motor rhythm such as the wingbeat. Analysis of these constraints reveals distinct coordination regimes: permissive regimes in which phase locking can emerge without dedicated coupling, and constrained regimes in which progressive phase slip or decoupling becomes unavoidable as sensory demand increases. Monte Carlo simulations show that transitions between synchrony and asynchrony arise as necessary consequences of first-principles timing constraints and bounded motor dynamics, rather than from changes in behavioural strategy. Increased motor flexibility shifts, but does not eliminate, the boundaries of synchrony-permissive regimes. Empirical observations from field studies are discussed as illustrative examples of these regimes, highlighting how apparent coupling and decoupling can both emerge from the same underlying control architecture. Together, this work identifies temporal feasibility as a governing constraint on echolocation behaviour, clarifies when buffered pseudo--closed-loop operation can masquerade as feedback control, and generates testable predictions for when and why wingbeat--call synchrony should fail in ecological contexts such as prey pursuit. More broadly, the framework situates bat echolocation within a general class of active sensing systems shaped by delayed feedback and bounded response dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

CNVs often confer selective advantages, but can also incur fitness costs. Evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in nutrient-limited chemostats recurrently selects for amplifications of nutrient transporter genes. However, their fate upon return to a non-selective environment remains unknown. To investigate CNV fitness and stability upon removing the original selection pressure, we studied 15 CNV lineages (11 segmental, 4 whole-chromosomal amplifications) selected in nitrogen-limited chemostats. CNV stability was monitored using fluorescent reporters during propagation in nutrient-rich batch cultures for 110-220 generations. All aneuploid lineages showed rapid CNV loss and reversion to a single-copy genotype, whereas segmental amplifications were remarkably stable- one of 11 strains reverted. Pairwise fitness competitions in rich media revealed strong fitness defects associated solely with CNVs that reverted; reversion led to increased fitness. Using simulation-based inference to estimate reversion rates and fitness effects, we determined negative selection as the primary driver of CNV loss. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that reversion of aneuploids and a segmental amplification left no evidence of prior CNV existence, rendering revertant genomes indistinguishable from the single-copy ancestor. Detailed characterization of a partial revertant identified chromosomal translocation, suggesting that extant CNVs can undergo structural diversification. Our findings provide novel evidence that most segmental CNVs adapted to nitrogen limitation are stable upon removal of selection, but costly gene amplifications are readily reversible. Together, these highlight the importance of CNVs in both long-term genome evolution and rapid, reversible adaptation to transient selection.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Hence, there is a pressing need for simple, sensitive, yet eco-friendly biosensor setups to monitor metal contamination in the environment. Existing biosensors are limited by poor efficiency, stability issues, and complex instrumentation requiring skilled operators. To address these caveats, current study explores how intein-mediated protein splicing, a spontaneous post-translational process, can be adapted for metal-biosensing by coupling metal-dependent splicing inhibition to viability loss of native microbial cells. Toxic metal ions like Cd2+ and Hg2+ attenuated the splicing activity of Mtb SufB precursor protein over a concentration range of 25 {micro}M to 2 mM, while Pb2+ and Cr3+ failed to do so. An innovative biosensor platform was designed for colorimetric detection of metal ions via simple Alamar Blue assay, where attenuated Mtb strain (H37Ra) served as the indicator cells. Metal-induced SufB splicing inhibition led to loss of viability of H37Ra cells, while addition of metal-specific chelators reversed the effect. Multiplexing ability was evaluated by including known splicing inhibitors like Cu2+, Zn2+, and Pt4+ over various concentration range alongside Cd2+ and Hg2+. The simple 96-well plate format enables multiplexed qualitative metal detection, while colorimetric absorbance measurement ensures metal quantification. The designed biosensor offers low-cost, user-friendly, and sensitive assay for high- throughput metal detection, utilizing whole-cell native organisms carrying metal-sensing precursor protein.

A few two-component lantibiotics including roseocin produced by Streptomycetes do not follow this general scheme and act by different, currently unresolved mechanisms. An important first step in studying this latter group of lanthipeptides is determination of their chemical structure. Roseocin's {beta}-peptide (Ros{beta}) is formed by the RosM lanthipeptide synthetase from the RosA1 precursor peptide. RosM carries out nine dehydrations of Ser and Thr residues to the corresponding dehydroamino acids followed by six Michael-type additions of the thiols of Cys residues to a subset of the dehydroamino acids to form six thioether crosslinks. Sequence alignment with other structurally characterized lanthipeptides does not allow prediction of the ring pattern of Ros{beta}. In this study, Ros{beta} was produced in Escherichia coli and its ring pattern was established by multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.

EVs are known to modulate the behavior of various cancer cells, and structural and functional abnormalities in primary cilia have been reported in multiple cancer types. We previously demonstrated that PANC-1 cells, a human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line, acquire enhanced primary cilia formation after surviving solitary culture conditions, and that their cilia contribute to tumor-like cell mass formation. Here, we explored part of the underlying mechanism of this phenotype by investigating the contribution of EVs released from the primary cilia of PANC-1 cells. PANC-1 clones generated by limiting dilution exhibited enhanced ciliogenesis and distinct ciliary morphologies compared with parental cells. These clones also released higher levels of cilia-derived EVs, including an expanded population of freely floating EVs within the culture environment. Biochemical analyses further showed that this increase was selective for primary cilia-derived EVs rather than reflecting a global rise in total EV production. Functionally, EV fractions enriched in cilia-derived EVs suppressed parental PANC-1 cell migration, altered cell morphology, and promoted cell aggregation, mimicking key behavioral traits of solitary condition-surviving PANC-1 clones. Together, these findings identify enhanced release of primary cilia-derived EVs as a distinct feature of PANC-1 cells adapted to solitary growth and suggest their potential involvement in the malignant and metastatic behaviors of pancreatic cancer.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

IPS was stronger among socially familiar peers, and context dependent, emerging during close-proximity interactions and joint attention to shared stimuli, but not dispersed interactions. IPS was also modulated by acoustic context, with low-to-medium sound pressure levels and medium-to-high signal-to-noise ratios enhancing synchrony. These findings demonstrate that IPS emerges in naturalistic social settings, and establish IPS as a marker of real-world social engagement.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

While most noted for their ability to transduce bidirectional phosphotyrosine signals in development, certain Ephs and Ephrins also become overexpressed and participate in pathological situations, including EphB1 in chronic pain/addiction and EphB2 in fibroinflammatory disorders and cancer. We searched for small molecules that disrupt EphB-EphrinB receptor-ligand interactions and discovered compounds with submicromolar activity that specifically inhibit formation of the tetramer. Compounds effectively target tetramer-driven EphB1-EphrinB2 and EphB2-EphrinB2 interactions, while showing less action towards the more dimer-driven EphB4-EphrinB2 interaction. They are orally available, exhibit drug-like qualities to reduce both EphB forward and EphrinB reverse signaling, and act to blunt inflammatory pain and opioid withdrawal behaviors. Tetramer inhibitors thus present a novel way to target Eph-Ephrin macromolecular interactions and counter pathologies caused or exacerbated by excessive bidirectional signaling.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

The tetramerization mechanism - central to how these receptor-ligand molecules become activated - has remained poorly understood. We find EphrinB2 functions as a proteinaceous chelator that binds to two juxtaposed arginine-rich electropositive pockets on the surface of EphB receptors when presented as two precisely aligned EphB-EphrinB2 dimers. This snaps the two low-affinity dimers into the very high-affinity circular tetramer, activating the molecules to begin transducing their forward and reverse signals into the cells they are expressed on. Contrary to assumptions that Ephrins do not interact with metals, we show EphrinB2 does indeed bind copper ions at very low micromolar concentrations, a feature consistent with Ephrin ancestry to Cupredoxins. This explains why metal chelators such as EDTA, EGTA, and 8-hydroxyquinoline are potent tetramer inhibitors, as they can bind the EphB arginine-rich copper-like electropositive pocket to compete with EphrinB2 binding. Our findings reveal how small molecules, pH, salts, and copper dynamically modulate the kinetics of Eph-Ephrin binding and provide a mechanistic framework for therapeutic targeting of the tetramer.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Harnessing such information to induce regeneration in a non-regenerative setting has been a long-sought goal. The amputated salamander limb efficiently regenerates all of its missing bones, but paradoxically, a large bone gap without amputation - commonly called a Critical Size Defect (CSD) - is not regenerated, similarly to other vertebrates [Chen et al., 2015]. This non-regenerating injury provides a human-relevant setting to understand how to rescue lack-of-regeneration. Satoh and colleagues demonstrated in axolotl that transplantation of blastema cells from an amputated limb into a CSD yields cartilage bridging of the CSD [Satoh et al., 2010]. This work provided a roadmap for rescuing the CSD. Here we asked, what are the crucial molecular differences in cells populating a regenerating blastema versus the CSD and can they be used to elicit CSD bridging? Previous genetic fate mapping and single cell transcriptomics showed that limb regeneration occurs via migration and dedifferentiation of fibroblastic, soft connective tissue (CT) cells that form a multipotent, skeletal stem cell [Currie et al, 2016, Gerber et al, 2018]. Here using single cell transcriptomics and genetic fate mapping we found that the CSD is populated by CT cells that undergo a divergent molecular transition compared to the blastema. Using gene regulatory network (GRN) modeling, and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of mRNA we could express a single molecular factor, Wnt3a, to induce cartilage bridging of the CSD.

While representational structures for dozens of colors have been studied, exploring structures spanning hundreds or thousands of colors has been infeasible due to the time costs of psychophysical experiments. Given these constraints, deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted attention as a promising tool for providing proxies or predictions of human perception beyond the scope of psychophysical experiments. However, it remains unclear which DNN models possess internal representations that geometrically align with human color perception. Furthermore, it is unclear which learning paradigm enables DNNs to acquire a color representation that is geometrically aligned with that of humans. Here, we systematically investigate which learning paradigm enables DNNs to produce a color representation that is structurally congruent with that of humans, with a focus on three types: self-supervised learning (SSL) that trains on images alone, supervised learning (SL) that trains on images with category labels, and contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) that trains on image-text pairs. We compared internal representations of DNNs with the human similarity judgments of 93 colors using a rigorous unsupervised method termed Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT), which reveals whether the representational structures of humans and models align at the fine-item level. Our results show that only the CLIP paradigm acquires color representations that strongly align with human data at the fine-item level. Furthermore, when we leveraged a key advantage of DNNs and investigated a substantial representational structure of 4096 colors, the human-aligned CLIP models consistently converged on a non-trivial distorted ring-like structure, which presents a plausible prediction for the large-scale human color representation. Our work demonstrates an approach for exploring unknown territories of human perception through the use of computational models validated in a limited empirical space, and provides predictions for future large-scale psychophysical experiments.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

In the Drosophila ovary, piRNAs are produced in a membrane-less organelle called nuage, in which many piRNA factors are localized. Among them, Squash (Squ) has also been identified as a key component in piRNA-directed TE silencing. However, its molecular function remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Squ leads to defective piRNA biogenesis, which is associated with the abnormal accumulation of precursor transcripts and the specific destabilization of Ago3, a member of the PIWI-family proteins. Reducing Ago3 results in enhanced homotypic piRNA amplification mediated by Aub itself, rather than the heterotypic ping-pong amplification between Aub and Ago3. Additionally, we demonstrate that Squ is a functional cofactor of the RNA helicase, Spindle-E (Spn-E), which plays a vital role in piRNA biogenesis. Point mutations that abrogate the interaction between Squ and Spn-E result in TE de-repression and defective precursor processing, suggesting that Squ works with Spn-E to ensure the proper piRNA biogenesis.

The Plex Research artificial intelligence (AI) platform was utilized for target deconvolution of the lead hit compound, -terthienyl. In vivo efficacy was assessed in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) C57BL/6J mouse model of MASLD. Biochemical assays and molecular docking simulations were performed to validate predicted target interactions.\n\nResultsPhenotypic screening identified 15 chemical probes/drugs that elicit dose-responsive inhibition of steatosis, and 16 that exacerbate steatosis, which could contribute to worsening of the disease clinically. -terthienyl, a plant-derived natural product, was identified as a potent and non-toxic inhibitor of steatosis in PH5CH8 cells with an EC50 of 106 nM. In vivo, -terthienyl administration to diet-induced obesity (60% fat diet) mice significantly reduced hepatic steatosis histologically, improved glucose tolerance, and favorably modulated serum biomarkers including ALT and AST. AI-driven analysis predicted dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV) and 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17{beta}13) as potential molecular targets of -terthienyl. Biochemical inhibition of DPP-IV was observed and an oxidized -terthienyl analog inhibited HSD17{beta}13. Molecular docking supported these predictions, indicating binding to DPP-IV and HSD17{beta}13.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates the successful application of phenotypic screening integrated with AI-driven target deconvolution to identify compounds and drugs that ameliorate or exacerbate hepatic steatosis. -terthienyl was identified as a novel modulator of hepatic steatosis with in vivo efficacy in a MASLD model.

A hallmark of primate brain evolution is PFC expansion accompanied by a posterior displacement of the MC. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling has emerged as a key regulator of PFC specification and expansion. However, the mechanisms that spatially confine RA signaling within the developing PFC, and the downstream RA-responsive gene networks, remain poorly understood. Here we defined an RA-associated gene regulatory network (RA-GRN) in the developing human PFC and identified MEIS2, which encodes a transcription factor linked to intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as its key hub of this network. Conditional deletion of Meis2 in postmitotic cortical excitatory neurons in mice results in a partial respecification of prospective prefrontal association territories toward motor-like molecular and connectional features, highlighting a critical role of postmitotic neurons in establishing and maintaining cortical areal identities. Concomitant with Meis2 loss, the population of excitatory neurons expressing the RA-synthesizing enzyme ALDH1A3, and consequently RA signaling itself, is markedly reduced in the developing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These findings revealed a conserved autoregulatory loop: RA [-&gt;] MEIS2 [-&gt;] ALDH1A3 [-&gt;] RA that reinforces a PFC-enriched RA gradient and organizes the MC-PFC axis.

Although the effects of MHC polymorphisms on peptide binding and selection are well established, how micropolymorphisms within MHC supertypes impact immune recognition is poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel mechanism through which micropolymorphisms in two closely related HLA-A3 superfamily members determine TCR specificity. We previously showed that TCRs specific for a public neoantigen from the PIK3CA oncogene presented by HLA-A*03:01 were unable to recognize the same epitope in the context of HLA-A*03:02. We show here that the micropolymorphisms distinguishing A*03:02 from A*03:01 exert their effect by altering the conformational ensemble of the neoantigen in the groove, preventing it from adopting a conformation compatible with TCR binding. The effect is rooted in how the two polymorphic sites interact with other co-varying, evolutionarily coupled polymorphisms, revealing a cross-groove network of interactions that controls the conformational adaptability of the peptide/HLA complex. Notably, the static crystallographic structures of the A*03:01 and A*03:02 complexes are indistinguishable, emphasizing the importance of peptide/HLA motional dynamics and how they can be tuned to facilitate TCR selectivity. We suggest this reflects an evolved feature of class I MHC proteins that amplifies the impact of peptides in the groove, further diversifying epitopes and contributing to the ways TCRs and other immunoreceptors differentiate between antigens. Beyond this mechanistic insight, our findings emphasize the need for high-resolution HLA typing in efforts across immunology, including antigen-specific immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Plastic debris encompasses a large part of rafting communities today. As biodegradable plastics become more prevalent as an alternative to petroleum-based plastics, their biodegradable properties may impact the dynamics of rafting communities by influencing the composition of bacterial biofilms and attached marine invertebrates. Here, we investigated attached biofouling communities of bacteria and marine invertebrates on biodegradable surfaces compared to nonbiodegradable petroleum-based plastics and naturally occurring substrata. Six surface types -- polypropylene plastic (PP), polyethylene terephthalate plastic (PET), polylactic acid plastic (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates plastic (PHA), maple wood veneer, and propagules of the mangrove Rhizophora mangle -- were examined to determine if plastic type affected biofilm community composition on the surfaces as well as degradation patterns. Three replicates of each type of substratum were deployed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, approximately one meter below the mean low tide. Using digital image analysis, 16S rRNA sequencing, and metagenomic analyses, we found that the microbial biofilm, marine invertebrate inhabitants, and degradation patterns of plastics are different across the various substrate types tested. One biodegradable plastic, PLA, showed communities more similar to those seen on the two non-biodegradable plastics, PET and PP, while the other biodegradable plastic, PHA, had communities more like those observed on the natural substrata, the wood and mangrove propagule. Only one of the two biodegradable plastics showed early signs of degradation within 22 weeks of immersion in a marine environment, suggesting that biodegradable plastics are not manufactured to uniform standards.

A. d.; Zuanon, J.; Selinger, A.; Souza, U. P.; Duarte, R. M.", "abstract": "Ephemeral aquatic habitats, such as temporary pools and roadside ditches, are characterized by cyclical flooding and drying that create highly dynamic conditions for fish community assembly. These environments can exhibit high spatial and temporal variability in community structure driven by local topography, distance to source habitats and interannual variation in rainfall, which affects connectivity dynamics. As such, they provide unique opportunities to test hypotheses about the processes shaping metacommunities, particularly through the partitioning of beta diversity into turnover and nestedness components. Here, we investigate these processes in ephemeral aquatic habitats of the Atlantic Forest, where we sampled 36 temporary pools and 36 roadside ditches throughout 2024, recording 1,545 individuals from 20 species. Fish communities composition did not differ significantly between habitats or hydrological periods, but beta diversity was consistently high and predominantly influenced by turnover. This suggests spatial processes such as dispersal limitation and colonization history are key drivers of community structure in those temporary aquatic habitats. We tested whether beta diversity components were associated with local environmental (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, volume) and spatial (distance to the nearest stream) predictors. During the dry period, nestedness was positively correlated with differences in volume for temporary pools, indicating that greater habitat availability promotes species accumulation under low connectivity, where dispersal occurs possibly only by overland displacement. Additionally, turnover was associated with differences in distance to the nearest stream in roadside ditches during the dry period, likely reflecting differential colonization by stream-associated species. During the wet period, differences in pH were correlated with turnover in roadside ditches, consistent with Mass Effect dynamics under higher connectivity conditions. Meanwhile, in temporary pools during the wet period, turnover increased with differences in distance to the nearest stream, suggesting colonization by highly tolerant and capable of dispersal species in more isolated sites. These contrasting relationships may also reflect the spatial organization of habitats, with linear ditches facilitating directional dispersal along roads, whereas spatially dispersed pools depend on more stochastic colonization. Thus, pools act as seasonal refugia for tolerant or amphibious species during low connectivity, and for stream-dwelling species during high connectivity, whereas ditches function as more persistent nodes that facilitate dispersal during wetter periods. This seasonal complementarity helps explain the observed temporal and habitat-related variation in beta diversity, highlighting that effective conservation must target the entire floodable mosaic, rather than isolated sites, to maintain this dynamic metacommunity.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

The widespread expression changes characteristic of old age therefore suggests that aging itself may partly stem from gene dysregulation. Alternatively, many of these changes may represent a plastic response to somatic decline, tuning the organism to an altered physiological state. We tested the latter hypothesis by experimentally reducing the condition of Drosophila melanogaster females independently of age and comparing the resulting expression changes with those occurring naturally during aging. Consistent with the plasticity hypothesis, we find substantial overlap between genes responding to reduced condition and old age. Downregulated genes are enriched for metabolic functions, with a consistent, albeit weaker, association with mitochondrial function and cytoplasmic translation, while upregulated genes relate to genome maintenance. Both old age and reduced condition also cause downregulation of tissue-specific and female-biased genes, as expected when energy is reallocated to core cellular processes. In line with a coordinated transcriptional response to old age, both down- and upregulated genes within enriched functional categories show reduced expression variability and experience strong purifying selection. Collectively, our results support that the aging soma elicits a plastic transcriptional program that adjusts the organism to a declining physiological condition, implying that many age-related expression changes mitigate rather than accelerate somatic aging. These findings call for a more nuanced view of the causes and consequences of age-related transcriptional change, with implications for both theoretical and applied research on aging and disease.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

DNA hypomethylation at the D4Z4 repeat and resulting abnormal derepression of the embryonic transcription factor DUX4 encoded in the D4Z4 repeat are the hallmark of FSHD. In order to investigate the impact of FSHD mutations within as well as outside of the disease loci, we performed Nanopore direct-RNA and genomic sequencing to characterize global and D4Z4-specific changes in isoform expression and DNA methylation using CRISPR-engineered human skeletal myoblast lines carrying FSHD mutations (D4Z4 contraction and SMCHD1 mutation) compared to the isogenic parental healthy control line. Nanopore sequencing allowed us to characterize the entire unedited control and contracted D4Z4 arrays as well as distinguish differential methylation patterns at the disease locus on chromosome 4qA from those at a nearly identical nonpathogenic D4Z4 repeat arrays on chromosome 10 and disease non-permissive 4qB allele.

The accessions subtle, quantitative variation, shaped by adaptation, enables us to identify which cellular parameters are flexible, revealing how developmental plasticity generates phenotypic plasticity. By developing live-cell imaging tools to track cellular behaviors during leaf growth under varying environmental conditions in these accessions, we could decompose stomatal density variation into its developmental origins. Variation in final stomatal numbers is driven by differences in the relative contributions of stomatal initiation, cell size-based fate thresholds, general proliferative capacity, and coordination between sister and neighbor cell behaviors. Overall, diverse accessions converge into two lineage regimes: one dominated by autonomous decisions with loose cell-cell coordination, the other by extensive cell-cell coordination. Challenging accessions with environmental fluctuations revealed regime-specific flexibility, with plasticity emerging through targeted adjustment of a single division-related parameter. Our results show how cellular parameters integrate into alternative developmental strategies that shape environmental responsiveness.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Here we define the in vivo proximity interactome of ARABIDOPSIS SKP1-LIKE 1 (ASK1), the core adaptor of SCF ubiquitin ligases, under acute abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and prolonged drought. TurboID-based proximity labeling coupled with quantitative proteomics revealed that ASK1 assembles highly condition-specific protein networks, distinguishing canonical SCF modules from broader noncanonical associations with transcriptional, chromatin, translational, vesicle-trafficking, and proteostasis machinery. Acute ABA exposure rapidly recruits F-box proteins and ABA-responsive transcription factors while engaging ribosomal and chromatin modules, whereas drought drives ASK1 into expanded proteostasis and stress-signaling assemblies, including chaperone-cochaperone systems, transcriptional repressors, and autophagy-endomembrane components. Global proteomics shows that ASK1 overexpression enhances accumulation of drought-protective and ABA-responsive proteins while repressing immune and ROS-scavenging pathways, indicating a shift in resource allocation. Together, these results describe ASK1 as a multifunctional proteostasis and signaling hub that integrates SCF-dependent and SCF-independent pathways to coordinate transcriptional, translational, and proteolytic reprogramming during plant adaptation to stress.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Despite extensive investigations into its origins, the etiology of ALS/PDC remains unclear. ALS/PDC is, at the neuropathology level, characterized by tau-dominant multiple proteinopathy in brain and spinal cord. It was recently reported that Guam ALS/PDC brain extracts exhibit tau seeding activity in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor cells. To build upon those findings and explore the nature of tau seeds in ALS/PDC in more detail, we used an alanine mutational scanning (Ala scan) approach to determine the seeding profile of tau in nervous tissues of Guam ALS/PDC cases. First, we confirmed the detection of tau seeding activity in ALS/PDC brain samples in tau biosensor cells. Notably, we could also detect potent tau seeding activity in spinal cord. Subsequent Ala scan assays demonstrated that ALS/PDC tau displays an aggregate incorporation pattern that resembles that of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)-type tau. This result is consistent with recent electron cryo-microscopy studies of tau, which revealed that ALS/PDC tau filaments are predominantly of the CTE-type. The structural characteristics and seeding behavior of ALS/PDC tau, as well as the regional distribution of tau pathology at post-mortem, suggest that ALS/PDC is a CTE-like tauopathy.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Although this architecture has long suggested hierarchical and parallel organization, a system-wide account of how behaviorally relevant visual features are routed and integrated across a complete visual system--in any animal--has remained elusive. The new male fly connectome now provides the synapse-level wiring needed to trace visual information from photoreceptors through the optic lobes and across the central brain. Applying a network-based analysis of information flow, we reveal a multi-layered architecture organized into distinct, functionally interpretable pathways. Using this framework to propagate signals through these pathways predicts receptive-field structure and feature selectivity consistent with physiological data, enabling large-scale functional annotation of thousands of neuron types. We find that distinct visual input channels are broadly distributed throughout the brain, yet converge in focal regions of feature specificity and acute spatial vision.

D.; Jiang, X.", "abstract": "Both biologically-produced human voices and algorithmically-generated AI speech manifest speaker identity. Critically, prosodic variations modulate the acoustic dimensions (e.g., fundamental frequency) that also shape individual speaker identity representations. So far it remains unclear whether listeners process speaker identities in human and AI voices through neurologically equivalent mechanisms, nor how prosodic cues might influence these cognitive processes. We examined event-related potentials during old/new speaker discrimination after name-based identity learning, and further analyzed correctly recognized old speakers comparing trials where prosody matched vs. mismatched between learning and testing. For old/new discrimination, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed three significant late windows (662-1498 ms) with Pz as the primary contributor for AI voices, yet none for human voices. Univariate analyses revealed that human voices showed earlier widespread discrimination (N250: 200-280 ms), while both voice types converged on Pz as the strongest contributor based on effect size rankings for late old/new effects (400-800 ms). These old/new effects emerged across completely different speech content between learning and testing, addressing a gap in prior literature. For speaker-specific prosodic expectation effects in the 500-900 ms window, unexpected prosody elicited late positivity for human voices compared to the prosody used during learning, whereas AI voices elicited late negativity. The late positivity resembles P600 components observed for communicative style expectancy violations, while the late negativity likely reflects effortful reprocessing of prosodic violations within atypical synthetic signals, analogous to accented speech processing.

MPP treatment markedly downregulated Oxa1L expression, accompanied by selective loss of mitochondrial genome-encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, elevated reactive oxygen species, and ATP depletion. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses demonstrated that Oxa1L deficiency exacerbated, whereas Oxa1L overexpression alleviated, mitochondrial dysfunction under Parkinsonian stress.

Although density-dependent population regulation is widespread in the animal kingdom, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show here that C. elegans animals respond to the crowding stress by secreting CPR-4, a homologue of human cathepsin B cysteine protease, to promote chromosomal DNA damage in germ cells, leading to high density-induced deficiencies that include increased embryonic lethality and larval arrest and decreased brood size. CPR-4 mediates these crowding responses through the insulin-like growth factor receptor DAF-2, multiple components in the insulin signaling pathway, and the SKN-1/Nrf transcription factor. Whole genome sequencing analyses of animals from 10 generations of continual growth in the crowded condition reveal that CPR-4-induced DNA damage produces an average of 2.9 more de novo genome mutations per animal per generation and a 75% increase in mutation rate compared with animals grown in the uncrowded condition. CPR-4-induced mutagenesis also facilitates evolution of the genomes through multi-generational crowding selection, leading to biased mutation distributions towards the intergenic regions over the gene bodies and crowd-inducible growth advantage. Our findings suggest that CPR-4 acts as a crucial crowd-responding factor to induce chromosomal DNA damage, leading to density-dependent deficiencies, increased genome mutation rates, and genome evolution and competitive growth of animals in response to the crowding stress.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

During neural tube closure, the neural plate dynamically remodels to produce a closed tube that provides the structural foundation for the developing brain and spinal cord. How cells maintain epithelial integrity despite the forces required for tissue morphogenesis during neural tube closure is not understood. We show that mechanical forces are upregulated during cranial neural tube closure in the mouse embryo and recruit the force-sensitive protein Vinculin to adherens junctions. Leveraging a genetically engineered embryonic stem cell-based pipeline to efficiently generate mutant embryos, we show that Vinculin mutants produce mechanical forces correctly but fail to maintain cell adhesion under tension, resulting in a failure of cranial neural fold elevation. Live imaging of cell behavior in the developing midbrain reveals that apical constriction, cell rearrangement, and cell division initiate correctly in Vinculin mutants, but their progression is impeded by disruption of adherens junctions at sites of increased tension. These results demonstrate that Vinculin is required to reinforce cell adhesion in response to increasing physiological forces during cranial neural tube closure, and that this activity is necessary to translate these forces into changes in tissue structure.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Existing approaches have made substantial progress along complementary axes: supervised sequence-to-function models achieve high accuracy for specific assays and organisms, self-supervised genomic foundation models learn transferable representations from large-scale sequence data, and conditional generative models enable principled sequence design guided by functional objectives. However, these strengths are typically realized in isolation - across distinct model classes, architectures, and training regimes - limiting the ability to combine long-context, base-resolution prediction, functional modeling, and controllable generation within a single efficient framework that generalizes across organisms and modalities. Here we introduce Nucleotide Transformer v3 (NTv3), a multi-species foundation model that unifies representation learning, functional-track and genome-annotation prediction, and controllable sequence generation within a common backbone. NTv3 uses a U-Net-like architecture to enable single-base tokenization and efficient modeling of contexts up to 1 Mb. We pre-train NTv3 on 9 trillion base pairs from OpenGenome2 using base-resolution masked language modeling, followed by post-training with a joint objective that integrates continued self-supervision with supervised learning on 16,000 functional tracks and annotation labels from 24 animal and plant species. After post-training, NTv3 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for functional-track prediction and genome annotation across species, outperforming leading sequence-to-function and foundation-model baselines on established benchmarks and on the new NTv3 benchmark, a controlled downstream fine-tuning suite in a standardized 32 kb input / base-resolution output setting. We further show that NTv3 consolidates a shared regulatory grammar across tasks, enabling coherent long-range genome-to-function inference and variant-associated remodeling. Finally, we fine-tune NTv3 into a controllable generative model via masked diffusion language modeling and use it to design enhancer sequences with specified activity levels and promoter selectivity. We validate these designs experimentally, showing that generated enhancers recapitulate the intended activity stratification and achieve the desired promoter-specific activation in cellulo.

Yet, there is still treatment failure in the clinic largely attributed to the heterogenous patterns of tumor irradiation by -particles. Although -particles are essentially impervious to resistance, attributed to the complex double-strand DNA breaks they cause while traversing cells, cells not being directly hit by -particles will likely not be killed. The diffusion-limited poor tumor penetration of high-affinity (strongly-binding) antibody-radioconjugates combined with -particles' short-range in tissue (only 40-80m), let tumor regions far from vasculature inadequately irradiated, therefore, possibly escaping treatment. METHODS: To improve penetration of delivered activity within tumors, we engineered separate actinium-225 antibody-radioconjugates of variable affinities (''affinity cocktails'') targeting the same marker on cancer cells, that were chosen based on their preferential irradiation of complementary regions of the same tumors. The cocktails comprise: (a) ''high-affinity'' antibody-radioconjugates (as the ones on clinical trials), which mostly deliver their cargo in tumor cells close to the vasculature, where the ''low(er)-affinity'' antibody-radioconjugates fail to deliver effective doses, due to their fast clearance; and (b) ''low(er)-affinity'' antibody-radioconjugates, that penetrate the deeper parts of tumors farther from the vasculature, where the ''high-affinity'' antibodies fail to reach. The efficacy of affinity cocktails was assessed in spheroids, that were employed as surrogates of tumor avascular regions, and on mice with subcutaneous xenografts of different cancer origin, expression levels and/or type of the targeted receptor: HER2 highly-expressing BT-474 breast cancer cells, HER2 moderately-expressing HEPG2 hepatoma cells, and/or HER1 low-expressing BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells. RESULTS: Although the high-affinity antibody-radioconjugates were most lethal against cancer cells in monolayers, affinity cocktails were most effective in inhibiting spheroid growth, due to better collective spreading of the antibody-conjugates within the spheroids volume. On all mouse models, and for the same total injected activity, affinity cocktails resulted in the best tumor growth inhibition, even at lower tumor absorbed doses, compared to the high-affinity antibody-radioconjugates alone. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study in -particle antibody-delivery to solid tumors demonstrates that ''separating'' the two key processes of diffusion and reaction/binding improves treatment efficacy.

Existing studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) especially transfer learning (TL) could address BC health disparities by transferring information learned from a majority group (e.g., White American women) to minority groups (e.g., Black American women). However, these studies have the following limitations: (1) the performance will decrease significantly as limited patient samples for training can be collected in clinical settings; and (2) most of existing studies only leverage single-omics data without exploring multi-omics integration. We recently presented a transfer learning method by integrating two multi-omics data for reducing cancer disparities. However, the integration model was not optimized, and its performance in reducing disparities was not robust. To address these concerns, we propose a weighted multi-modal transfer learning framework called MOTLAB designed to optimize the multi-omics integration equipped with data augmentation to systematically mitigate racial disparities in BC. Specifically, we first calculated patient-patient similarity using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), which were used to construct a weighted integration of multi-omics data. Then, we performed a nested grid search method to optimize the weight combinations for each omics modality, which were subsequently used in multi-omics data integration to generate input data of the transfer learning model. In addition, to reduce the impact of data imbalance problems for our TL model, we leveraged a data augmentation named Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for the minority groups to further boost performance of reducing health disparities. Results based on a dataset of 1085 female BC patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database suggested that MOTLAB with optimized weighted integration of three omics data (including mRNA, miRNA and methylation) outperformed existing multi-omics transfer learning models. Moreover, MOTLAB achieved better performance than single-omics and two-omics-integration transfer learning models as well as conventional mixed models and independent models for BC health disparities mitigation. We anticipate that MOTLAB will serve as a new approach to reduce health disparities in BC diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, and be extensible to mitigate health disparities for other types of cancer.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Vulnerable plaques are characterized by a thin fibrous cap and reduced numbers of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). SMCs are essential for plaque stability, as they synthesize collagen and support fibrous cap structure. Our previous work demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) enhances plaque stability and upregulates La ribonucleoprotein domain family member 6 (Larp6), a collagen mRNA-binding protein in SMCs. However, the specific role of Larp6 in atherosclerotic plaque stability remains undefined. Methods: In vitro, human aortic SMCs (hAoSMCs) were used to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying IGF-1 regulation of LARP6. Using the Myh11 promotor we generated SMC specific Larp6 overexpression mice on an ApoE-/- background (SMC-Larp6) to assess effects on plaque stability. Bulk RNA sequencing data from human atherosclerotic plaques (GSE120521) were analyzed to compare stable and vulnerable plaques. Results: IGF-1 regulates LARP6 through phosphorylation and downregulation of microRNAs. Plaques from SMC-Larp6 mice exhibited a significantly higher collagen content, accompanied by a thicker fibrous cap and a smaller necrotic core, increased presence of SMCs, without changes in overall plaque burden compared to controls. LARP6 overexpression in hAoSMCs significantly increased cell proliferation and survival under oxidative stress and promoted collagen accumulation by enhancing collagen synthesis. RNA sequencing analysis of human atherosclerotic plaques revealed reduced expression of LARP6 and downregulation of extracellular matrix-related pathways in unstable plaques, underscoring the clinical relevance of these findings. Conclusions: Larp6 overexpression promotes SMC survival, collagen synthesis and features of plaque stability under atherosclerotic conditions.

At 12 months, male C57BL/6 mice were chronically administered control diet, one of 5 monotherapy diets or one of 3 polypharmacy diets with an increasing Drug Burden Index (measure of total exposure to sedative and anticholinergic medications).

In the healthy brain, microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), regulate neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity. However, the role of microglia in promoting tumor-associated hyperexcitable neural networks in glioma remains unknown. Here, we investigate the activity-regulated engulfment of neuronal synapses by microglia in both healthy and glioma-bearing mice, and further explore how glioma cells alter microglia-mediated circuit refinement, contributing to pathogenic neuronal hyperexcitability. Microglia-mediated circuit refinement in the glioma microenvironment was characterized through synaptic engulfment analysis of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses by microglia in healthy mice and patient-derived DMG xenograft models, paired with optogenetic stimulation in the neocortex. We found that glutamatergic neuronal activity in the healthy brain increased excitatory synaptic engulfment by microglia in a previously unappreciated negative feedback mechanism that may guard against hyperexcitability. In contrast, this activity-regulated increase in excitatory synaptic engulfment was abrogated in DMG-infiltrated brains. Instead, inhibitory synaptic engulfment was significantly increased in DMG in response to glutamatergic neuronal activity. Together, these dysregulated synaptic engulfment mechanisms may create imbalance in the excitatory to inhibitory (E:I) synapse ratio predicted to increase neuronal excitability. Complementary single-nuclei sequencing studies revealed concordant tumor-specific, activity-regulated changes in microglia-neuron signaling showing reduced expression of excitatory synaptic refinement gene programs in microglia, potentially mediating the aberrant synaptic engulfment observed in DMG.

To minimize head motion during scanning, habituation under physical restraint is commonly used. However, it remains unclear how stress levels and head motion evolve during habituation, particularly within the MRI environment. To address this, we repeatedly measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels in three groups of mice - controls, mice habituated outside the MRI magnet, and mice habituated within the fMRI environment - and acquired longitudinal resting-state fMRI data daily during an eight-day habituation period and again 15 days post-habituation at 15.2 T. We found that CORT levels initially increased by approximately twofold and gradually decreased during habituation outside the magnet, whereas in mice habituated within the fMRI environment, CORT levels increased two- to fourfold and remained elevated throughout the habituation period.

Throughout all resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, head motion and functional connectivity remained stable, likely due to the well-designed restraint cradle that permitted paw movement.

Whether such biases can be flexibly and rapidly modulated by environmental structure remains unknown. Here we show that global conflict in the environment can suppress Pavlovian avoidance and enhance instrumental choice, particularly in individuals high in trait anxiety. One hundred and sixteen participants completed a sequential approach avoidance task in which three options differed in reward-punishment conflict, and blocks varied the frequency of high conflict encounters. In low conflict environments, participants exhibited pronounced and misplaced avoidance of objectively safe, no conflict options indicating that choices are not determined by local contingencies alone but are tuned to broader environmental context. Interestingly, increasing environmental conflict reduced this maladaptive avoidance: approach to safe options increased, and reinforcement learning and drift diffusion modelling revealed higher reward sensitivity and drift rates alongside reduced lapse and Pavlovian bias parameters. These effects were strongest in high anxious individuals, whose behaviour shifted markedly toward that of low anxious peers. Crucially, benefits depended on the frequency of conflict encounters and were not elicited by cue outcome reversals or increased punishment probability alone. Furthermore, a modified Go/NoGo task replicated global conflict dependent improvements on Pavlovian incongruent trials. Together, these results demonstrate that global environmental conflict can rapidly recalibrate the balance between Pavlovian and instrumental systems, attenuating maladaptive avoidance and disproportionately aiding anxious individuals. We propose that conflict driven arousal dynamics, plausibly mediated by LC-NE mechanisms, promote this adaptive reconfiguration of defensive and goal directed control.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Through image-based profiling using Cell Painting, we leveraged trophoblast cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from male and female SCZ and neurotypical donors with varying placental genomic risk scores (PlacGRS) to explore the developmental dynamics of placental cells under normal growth and hypoxic stress.

Our findings reveal a salient nucleus-localized SCZ risk signature across cell lines, along with clear sexual dimorphism.

In contrast, Lucilia cuprina cuprina is necrophagous and not a pest. We have been interested in identifying the genes that may play a role in the evolution of a parasitic lifestyle in blowflies. The objective of the present work was to explore the physiological role of the L. cuprina long neuropeptide F gene (LcNPF) in L. c. cuprina. We used CRISPR/Ca9 to generate a strain carrying a loss-of-function knock-in mutation for LcNPF. An RNA-Seq analysis was performed, and physiological and behavioral assays were conducted to evaluate the role of LcNPF in larvae and adult flies. Our findings indicate that functional disruption of the LcNPF gene significantly impairs egg hatching, larval survival, weight gain, crawling speed and larval time to pupariation. These phenotypic changes were corroborated by RNA-Seq analysis, which revealed downregulation of transcripts in LcNPF null mutated larvae associated with the respective physiological processes. In contrast, the foraging behavior of the larvae under the tested conditions was not affected. Interestingly, NPF appears to be essential for the oviposition preference of females for rotten meat but not for male mating behavior or fertility.

MAGNET integrates multi-task, cross-modal and cross-dimensional (2D + 3D) image restoration capabilities within a single unified architecture, and it is specifically designed to handle composite degradations in practical imaging systems. The framework comprises three components: (i) a task-aware, prompt-guided feature enhancement module for adaptive learning across diverse degradations; (ii) an LIIF-based reconstruction module enabling continuous, resolution-adaptive restoration; and (iii) a dimension-compatible triple-plane projection module supporting both 2D and 3D data. Trained on large-scale datasets spanning 5 major microscopy modalities (structured illumination, confocal, light-sheet, wide-field and two-photon) and 8 representative restoration tasks, MAGNET achieves state-of-the-art performance across super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, background suppression, isotropic reconstruction, aberration correction, de-scattering and virtual staining. Beyond supervised training, MAGNET supports direct inference on unseen systems, efficient few-shot fine-tuning and self-supervised test-time optimization, enabling robust performance across diverse data and imaging conditions.

Additionally, Swe1-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1/Cdc28) reinforces this arrest. Once the checkpoint is released, Cdk1 activation is essential for meiosis I entry and requires removal of inhibitory phosphorylation on tyrosine 19, governed by the opposing activities of the Swe1 kinase and the Mih1 phosphatase. Here, we dissect how this network is rewired at the prophase I to meiosis I transition. We show that Swe1 is essential for checkpoint maintenance, but not for its initial activation. We also demonstrate that Cdc5 promotes Cdk1 activation through a dual mechanism: by inducing Swe1 degradation and facilitating Mih1 nuclear translocation. Unlike in mitosis, Cdc5-dependent Swe1 degradation in meiosis does not require CDK-mediated priming and can occur when both proteins are artificially colocalized, indicating a distinct regulatory mode. Our findings uncover a novel function for Cdc5 in promoting meiotic cell cycle progression beyond its known roles in recombination and synaptonemal complex disassembly, highlighting how conserved cell cycle regulators are adapted to meiosis.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Here we develop a spanning-tree-based framework to quantify allosteric communication as an ensemble of interacting pathways in protein contact networks. We introduce a dynamic distance measure linking local perturbations of residue interactions to global changes in network entropy, establishing a local-to-global scaling between local dynamics and global sensitivity. Using spanning-tree calculus, we derive exact probabilities for all simple paths connecting pre-specified functional residue pairs. This enables a comparison between an approximate description based on uniform path usage and a topology-aware description in which path probabilities are determined by the Burton-Pemantle theorem and reflect network dependencies. From these path ensembles, we define corresponding signal-to-noise ratios and quantify how pathway multiplicity and statistical weighting shape noise suppression. Applied to KRAS and to 20 additional allosteric proteins spanning diverse functional classes, the analysis shows large variability in path usage, entropy reduction, and signal-to-noise enhancement, while consistently demonstrating that topology-aware weighting concentrates signal transmission onto dominant short pathways. This suggests that the robustness of allosteric signaling is a fundamental emergent property of protein contact topology. These results provide a quantitative framework linking protein structure, dynamics, and information flow, and show that robustness in allosteric communication, manifested as noise suppression through pathway redundancy, can be interpreted as an intrinsic error-correction or noise averaging mechanism arising from network topology.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

L.; Kumar, P.; Morbia, I.; Singh, U.", "abstract": "Background: Cancers display near-universal hallmarks, including energy addiction, aerobic glycolysis and biosynthesis. In addition to glucose (and glutamine) addiction, cancers also display futile transcription. Discretely measurable futile transcription occurs between transcription start sites (TSSs) and start codons of protein-coding genes. Multiple TSSs for each gene offer various combinations of futile transcription with no effect on the encoded proteins. The relationship between proximal versus distal TSS deployment, futile transcription and energy addiction of cancers remain unclear. Methods: By analyzing FANTOM CAGE data we show that TSS deployment dysregulation in cancers increases the energy cost coefficients of cancer transcriptomes. We define the bases of the altered energy cost coefficients of cancer transcriptomes by comparing TSS deployment frequencies, associated entropies and futile transcription distances across heterogeneous pools of cancers and non-cancers. Results: We show that TSS deployment entropies differ between cancers and non-cancers. It leads to an overall higher distal TSS deployment in cancers but selectively favors an energy-economical proximal TSS deployment for cancer hallmark genes involved in cell proliferation and biosynthesis. We show that the frequency of TSS deployment is linked to the futile transcription distance and gene function differently in cancers and non-cancers. Conclusions: This work lays out a theoretical framework describing stochasticity of TSS deployment in the context of cancerogenesis and energetics of transcription. It also suggests that the current human TSS landscape has evolved to minimize futile transcription, an outcome favored by stochastic TSS deployment.

Their clinical potential derives from the , {beta}-epoxyketone pharmacophore, which covalently modifies the N-terminal catalytic threonine residue of proteasome {beta}-subunits with high selectivity. Although a synthetic , {beta}-epoxyketone (Carfilzomib) is approved for clinical use, stereo-controlled synthesis of the pharmacophore remains challenging, involving either multiple steps and energy-intensive processes, or unsustainable reagents. Unusual flavoenzymes catalyze the assembly of the pharmacophore in , {beta}-epoxyketone biosynthesis. A detailed understanding of the substrate scope and catalytic mechanism of these enzymes has thus far been limited by the intrinsic instability of their -(di)methyl-{beta}-ketoacid substrates. Here, we report the development and application of an esterase-mediated unmasking strategy for in-situ generation of these substrates from the corresponding methyl esters. Using this approach, we demonstrate that EpnF, the epoxyketone synthase involved in eponemycin / TMC-86A biosynthesis, tolerates a broad range of synthetic substrate analogs, including several with N-terminal protecting groups widely used in peptide synthesis. These findings establish that EpnF has the potential to be developed into a useful biocatalyst for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of di-peptidyl epoxyketone precursors of clinically approved drugs and drug candidates.

Because such highly electrophilic activating agents may lead to undesirable nucleotide modifications, we have examined the reaction of both types of activating agents with the canonical ribonucleotides A, U, C, and G, and the potentially primordial nucleotides 2-thio-C (s2C), 2-thio-U (s2U), and inosine (I). We find that the isonitrile-aldehyde system shows minimal hydroxyl modification but does modify the nucleobases of U, G, s2U, and I. Except for guanosine, these modifications are readily reversible. In contrast, IDI-NCI systems acylate ribonucleotide hydroxyls while modifying nucleobases only transiently; mildly acidic pH suppresses undesired modifications. Both classes of activating agents modify 2-thiopyrimidines on the sulfur, with the isonitrile-aldehyde reaction promoting desulfurization and thus conversion to the canonical pyrimidines. To evaluate compatibility with model protocells, we tested the effects of activation chemistry on fatty acid vesicles and found that protocell integrity was preserved at moderate reagent concentrations.

Conditions were first optimized for co-polymer dispersion and recovery into detergents, and analytical methods employed to assess activity and quality of detergent-solubilized proteins. Twelve protein targets were purified in co-polymer based on a 16-polymer screen.

Using long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations across a range of Spm concentrations, we quantify residue-level changes in intra-chain contacts relative to native contacts observed in fibrils, and corroborate computational predictions with ThT fluorescence assays for Tau constructs. Spm acts in a sequence- and region-specific manner, not simply through overall net charge. In K18, Spm binds near the fourth microtubule binding repeat, disrupting intra-chain contacts associated with Alzheimer's fibril structures and thereby inhibiting aggregation. In S, Spm binds mainly to acidic residues in the C-terminal half of the sequence and redistributes intramolecular contacts in a way that increases contact propensity in the central aggregation-prone region and therefore aggregation, in line with previous studies showing Spm-enhanced S aggregation. For A{beta}40, Spm neutralizes acidic residues near positions 22-24 and shifts the balance of intra-chain interactions toward its aggregation-prone core, resulting in a net promotion of fibril-like conformations. These divergent effects show that net charge alone cannot predict polyamine influence on IDPs. Instead, residue-specific binding hotspots and local reweighting of aggregation-linked contacts determine whether Spm promotes or suppresses fibril-like conformations.

The actin-binding reporter displays diffusion coefficients spanning more than two orders of magnitude, in stark contrast to an otherwise similar reporter that cannot bind actin, which diffuses much faster and within a much narrower range. Thus, the mobility of the reporter becomes a sensitive spatial readout of actin-mediated constraints. By comparing, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the diffusion of the actin-binding reporter with that of the non-binding mutant, we construct an actin-occupancy map that quantifies the fraction of the membrane functionally influenced by cortical actin. Using this approach, we find that the juxta-membrane actin cortex modulates transport over more than 80% of the cell surface. Our two-channel ImFCS strategy establishes diffusion-based comparison as a general methodology to map the functional footprint of the cortical cytoskeleton on live cell membranes.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

R.; Zhao, M.; Harrigan, O.; Absalon, S.; Huang, Y.; Cheng, Z.; Zhao, Y.; Chen, M.; Sun, S. Y.", "abstract": "Cilia and flagella are conserved organelles essential for sensory and motility functions and are assembled and maintained by bidirectional intraflagellar transport (IFT) along the axoneme. In Trypanosoma brucei, IFT is concentrated at the flagellar base near the transition zone and is restricted to four microtubule doublets (MTDs) as it traverses from the transition zone to the axoneme before reaching the extra-axonemal structure, the paraflagellar rod (PFR), associated region. To gain an insight on its initial working model before IFT restriction occurs, we revealed the in situ architecture of the IFT complex during the initial and complete landing to the transition zone using cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). IFT proteins assemble into polymeric trains upon landing. However, in the proximal portion of the flagellum, subtomogram averaging revealed that each single train is associated with individual MTDs at variable A- or B- tubule positions. By using miniaturized and enucleated T. brucei zoids that preserve the full circular arrangement of MTDs without milling, we revealed an alternating but spatially restricted IFT train pattern during the landing process, resembling the anterograde train scaffold known in Chlamydomonas. Magnify expansion microscopy further confirmed this restricted distribution of IFT proteins at the basal pool. Depletion of the IFT component IFT46 protein reduced the number of simultaneously docked trains without altering the restricted landing spatial pattern. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized spatial regulation governing IFT train initiation at the flagellar base, which could operate independently of IFT-B structural integrity, bridging the gap between the IFT architecture and doublet-spatial docking prior to anterograde transport.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

As biopesticides, they offer numerous advantages over chemical pesticides and hold significant potential for application in integrated pest management (IPM). However, their slower action compared to conventional synthetic strategies has limited their widespread adoption. This study aimed to investigate the impact of incorporating a viral protein, AcChiA chitinase, which disrupts the gut peritrophic membrane of susceptible insects, into AcMNPV occlusion bodies in trans. This was achieved through the development of an insect cell line that facilitates the passive incorporation of this protein. The presence of ChiA was detected in dissolved occlusion bodies (OBs) preparations from infected transgenic lines, in a method-dependent manner, with the stronger signals observed in chimeric polyhedra. It is hypothesized that ChiA in OBs will increase peritrophic membrane permeability and facilitate primary infection. In bioassays, OBs produced in ChiA-expressing lines were associated with higher larval mortality than OBs produced in Sf9, consistent with a ChiA-mediated effect. Notably, the addition of ChiA proteins from stably transformed insect cell lines improved infection rates, particularly in recombinant baculoviruses, which exhibited a significant reduction in occlusion-derived virion (ODV) occlusion. This underscores the critical role of these proteins in the oral infection process. Consequently, it was possible to incorporate the ChiA protein from stably transformed insect cell lines into wild-type and recombinant baculovirus occlusion bodies, paving the way for potential applications in IPM with AcMNPV.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we address this gap with a cellular phase field model that couples cell deformation, cell polarization governed by stochastic excitable dynamics, and confinement. We identify the confinement strength as a bifurcation parameter determining three regimes: strong confinement prevents rotation through spatial constraints, intermediate confinement induces stochastic transitions between chiral and non-chiral states, and weak confinement allows persistent rotational motion. For the intermediate regime, we develop a semi-Markovian renewal process framework that characterizes the stochastic dynamics through dwell time statistics, transition probabilities and first-passage times. For the weak confinement regime, we reveal that a mechanochemical feedback enables coherent rotations despite internal noise through the reduction of local excitability mediated by mechanical contraction. We formalize this feedback analytically using Kramers escape theory. Experiments on epithelial MCF10A cells in Matrigel validate predictions for the weak confinement regime.

Decoding of mRNA occurs in the small subunit of the ribosome and is mediated by tRNA anticodons. Regions near the decoding center are a target for antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides and tetracyclines, where their presence results in errors in protein synthesis. More than two decades of high-resolution structural studies have shown how such medically important antimicrobials (MIAs) bind to the small subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Here, we comprehensively analyze these previously reported structures to help understand the variability with which MIAs bind to small subunits of bacterial ribosomes. We previously solved the hibernating 70S ribosome structure of the bacterial pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi (Bbu), the causative agent of Lyme disease, but there is no structure of any MIA bound to this ribosome reported. Our structural analysis makes it possible to use inexpensive computational methods to predict binding of these MIAs to the Bbu ribosomal 30S small subunit. For this, we used structural analogy, restrained energy minimization, and single-point binding free energy computations. We find the single-point binding free energy of the MIAs to be very sensitive to small conformational changes in the MIA and its environment. Incorporating this knowledge in structure-guided design could aid in development of narrow-spectrum MIAs targeting specific bacterial pathogens.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the atomistic, microsecond-scale computational dissection of solvation dynamics in two structurally homologous but functionally distinct viral RNAs--BIV TAR and HIV-2 TAR--in both apo and peptide-bound states mimicking the salt concentration of experimental time-resolved fluorescent spectroscopic measurement. By combining high-temporal-resolution solvation time correlation functions with detailed energy decomposition analyses, we uncover how water, ions, and RNA motions cooperatively shape relaxation across ultrafast to nanosecond timescales. Our results reveal that, unlike DNA, where slow components primarily reflect long-lived hydration and ion condensation, RNA can generate slow solvation decay either through long-lived hydration or through its own internal conformational fluctuations, such as involving spontaneous base-flipping events. Peptide binding modulates this conformational landscape in strikingly system-specific ways: BIV TAR RNA undergoes classical fluctuation quenching, where TAT binding suppresses RNA motions and shifts relaxation toward solvent-RNA compensation, whereas HIV-2 TAR RNA exhibits a non-classical redistribution of solvent-ion-peptide correlations stemming from its weaker and more dynamic binding interface with TAT. The dominant slow decay in HIV-2 apo TAR maps directly onto an allosteric communication channel previously identified from structural analyses, demonstrating that solvation responses can sensitively report on RNA allostery. Together, this study bridges the experimental observations of time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy with mechanistic molecular insight, establishes solvation dynamics as a powerful probe of RNA conformational energetics, and highlights how subtle differences in RNA-protein recognition can imprint distinct signatures on hydration and ion reorganization.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and no effective otoprotective therapies exist. We aimed to establish a mouse model that replicates the clinical pattern of radiation-induced hearing loss. Methods: C57BL/6J mice (n=31) received 8Gy (n=3), 16Gy (n=5), 24Gy (n=8), or 32Gy (n=15) using the Leksell Gamma Knife ICON system. Targeting was based on the built-in cone-beam CT, co-registered with MRI and CT-based mouse atlases, to guide unilateral cochlea targeting. A single isocenter was placed lateral to the right cochlea, with the 80% isodose line traversing its medial edge. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 weeks post-SRS. A 32Gy subgroup (n=7) was evaluated at 16 weeks. Histological analysis of cochleae was performed at 4 weeks in all groups and at 16 weeks in the long-term 32Gy group. Results: SRS was well tolerated, and the contralateral cochlea received a very low radiation dose. No ABR shifts were observed at 8 or 16Gy, with only minimal histological changes. At 32Gy, ABR threshold shifts at 22.6 and 32kHz were evident by week1 and worsened by week4. Similar but milder effects occurred at 24Gy. In the 32Gy long-term subgroup, hearing loss progressed across all frequencies, most severely at high frequencies, alongside a sustained wave I amplitude decline. At 32 Gy, outer hair cells were reduced by 14% and 44% at 32 and 45.2 kHz, respectively, at 4 weeks, and by 38% and 80% at 16 weeks. Ribbon synapses were mildly reduced at 4 weeks and more markedly at 16 weeks in corresponding high-frequency regions. Spiral ganglion neuron density was mildly reduced at the basal and middle turns. All reported changes were statistically significant when compared to the contralateral ear. Conclusions: This new model reproduces key features of SRS-induced cochlear toxicity, including unilateral, dose-dependent, and progressive hearing loss.

This gap of information can lead to delayed assessment of responders versus non-responders and risks misinterpretation, potentially resulting in premature or erroneous treatment decisions. Thus, a universal surrogate marker may be of preeminent value in monitoring immune responses, guiding immunotherapies, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. To address this challenge, we developed two immunoPET tracers based on single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) that target the pan T-cell markers CD2 and CD7 to monitor and visualize T cells distribution in vivo. Methods: This study aimed to establish a comprehensive approach for clinical translation by assessing the feasibility and key characteristics of CD2- and CD7-sdAb for safe, effective clinical application. Binding specificity was confirmed through antigen transduction and knockout in tumor and T-cell leukemia cell lines. In vitro, cytokine secretion and T-cell cytotoxicity were evaluated, while a xenogeneic myeloid sarcoma mouse model was used to analyze T-cell cytotoxicity and visualize TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells at the tumor site using PET/MR imaging. Results: This study demonstrates the high specificity, affinity, and thermal stability of CD2- and CD7-sdAb, enabling efficient radiolabeling without impairing T-cell functionality. Specifically, binding to human CD8 T cells did not alter cytokine secretion or cytotoxicity in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo, the cytotoxic ability of transferred TCR-transduced human CD8+ T cells was not compromised upon i.v. application of CD2- and CD7-sdAb. Ultimately, intravenously injected 68Ga-NOTA-CD2-sdAb and 68Ga-NOTA-CD7-sdAb were respectively able to clearly depict and visualize previously administered TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells at the tumor site by PET/MRI. Conclusions: In this study we have developed two pan T-cell tracers that are able to visualize human T cells and clearly differentiate between responding- and non-responding tumors while not impacting T-cell functionality in vitro and in vivo.

For C. briggsae and Pristionchus pacificus we show that GTSF-1 interacts with RRF-3 and is essential for 26G-RNA production and fertility. We map this interaction to an N-terminal domain of RRF-3, termed the GTSF-1 interacting domain (GID), and show that the GTSF-1 zinc finger region alone is sufficient for binding. Mutagenesis identifies critical residues mediating this interaction and reveals that GTSF-1 stability depends on RRF-3. Other RdRPs possess GID-like domains, which we propose to bind GTSF-1-related proteins. Phylogenomic and structural analyses support GTSF-1-RRF-3 interactions across all major nematode lineages and map the shift in GTSF-1 activity to the last common nematode ancestor.

Despite its extracellular localization, S. capleta possesses a drastically reduced genome (~0.25 Mb) and is vertically transmitted through egg-associated spheres. Manipulating these spheres allowed us to experimentally exchange S. capleta between beetle species to determine their impact on host development. We show that non-native S. capleta can successfully colonize the symbiotic organs of a novel host, but that the interaction outcome correlates with genetic relatedness to the native symbiont. Genetically distant species trigger a more pronounced transcriptional response and can only partially rescue host development. While more closely related symbionts proliferate similarly to the native one and induce a comparable host response, they fail to propagate to the next generation, underscoring how transmission fidelity, host-symbiont compatibility, and local adaptation can further specificity within a Paleocene-aged partnership.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

EphA2, often overexpressed in cancer, is notable for its ligand-independent activation, which drives pro-oncogenic signaling distinct from the canonical, ligand-dependent pathway that restricts cell movement. While ligand binding induces extracellular clustering, kinase activation depends on dimerization within the transmembrane (TM) region. EphA1 and EphA2 differ substantially in their function, likely due to differences in their TM, juxtamembrane (JM), and membrane-proximal fibronectin type III (FN1/FN2) domains, but how these regions modulate dimerization remains unresolved. To address this, we performed extensive coarse-grained simulations using Martini 3 in an anionic POPC/PS/PIP2 membrane. Both receptors formed stable TM dimers, though EphA1 favored a symmetric AXXXGXXXG-centered interface, whereas EphA2 favoured an additional leucine zipper interface and both receptors sampled multiple configurations, reflecting substantial intrinsic variability. Basic residues in the JM region remained membrane-bound, and the EphA2 FN domain displayed sustained PIP2 interactions, consistent with previous observations. Notably, the FN2 domain alone restricted TM association in both receptors, whereas inclusion of the second FN1 domain restored dimerization but produced receptor-specific extracellular interfaces. These differences arise from distinct FN1-FN2 linker flexibilities and FN-domain membrane contacts, which together shape TM geometry and lipid engagement. Overall, our results highlight how TM and TM-proximal elements cooperatively tune dimerization in Eph receptors, offering mechanistic insight into the divergent activation behaviors of EphA1 and EphA2 and providing testable models relevant to cancer biology and Eph-driven signaling.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "There are several ways in which the nanoscale array of cellulose fibrils in one layer of a plant cell wall can rearrange to permit the cell wall to expand under stress. To be uniform enough for analysis, a cell-wall layer may consist of a single lamella of microfibrils in a primary cell-wall or the dominant S2 layer in a wood cell wall. The stress may be external uniaxial tension or, in the case of a primary-wall layer, the biaxial turgor pressure that drives growth. Under uniaxial tension, most cell-wall domains narrow as they elongate. During growth, cell diameter and hence the width of each cell-wall domain usually stay constant or increase in a controlled way. The balance of nanoscale deformation modes generates these cell-scale changes in dimensions. Here, seven such deformation modes are identified and their geometry is described for rectangular cell-wall domains with constant initial microfibril angle, a simplified model for one facet of a cell-wall. These deformation modes are fibril rotation, regular shear, interdigitated sliding, fibril stretching, widened fibril spacing and the formation and straightening of waves. The distinction between regular shear and interdigitated sliding is introduced to capture a continuous range of sliding modes at fibril interfaces, with varying proportions of sliding in opposite directions and varying outcomes for cell shape. An unforeseen finding was that the functions representing some of the deformation modes apply only to a rectangular domain of moderate aspect ratio, representing one facet of the wall of a cell of moderate length. For longer or shorter domains, different functions apply and the relative elongation of the domain diminishes as the aspect ratio rises. It is noticeable that cells elongating in vivo often remain within that moderate range. The scale-independent geometric descriptions presented here are a prerequisite for predicting how several modes of nanoscale deformation interact to create the observed changes in the mesoscale dimensions of the cell and thus to allow growth to shape the emergence of multicellular plant form.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

However high levels of production in stationary phase cultures often suffer from a progressive decline in metabolism. We demonstrate that in E. coli pyruvate accumulation, an inevitable consequence of high-flux metabolism, acts as a major inhibitor of stationary-phase glucose uptake. We present a novel central metabolism to optimize stationary phase production, a gluconate-bypass, which circumvents this challenge by rerouting carbon flux around glycolysis. This redesign achieves two critical outcomes: first, it decouples glucose uptake from pyruvate inhibition; second, glucose oxidation intrinsically co-generates the NADPH cofactor. Validated using NADPH-dependent L-alanine as a representative model, the GBP creates a self-regulating host that achieved a record titer of 197 g/L with a 1.6-fold extension of production longevity.

We combine a minimal, cell-free expression system with kinetic modeling to show how coupling enzymatic activity to biomolecular condensates drives emergent self-regulation via droplet formation and dissolution. In-vitro mRNA transcription induces phase separation with an intrinsically disordered protein (mutant G3BP1), forming condensates that modulate transcription and degradation kinetics. Our kinetic model shows that phase separation reduces rate constants, with slower degradation within condensates than in the mRNA-protein-poor phase. This leads to more mRNA with a prolonged lifetime of mRNA relative to the case without condensates. Extending the model to sustained and oscillatory resource supply reveals that condensates elevate mean mRNA levels and buffer deviations from the mean compared to the non-condensate scenario. These findings provide a general mechanism of cross-regulation and feedback between phase separation and enzymatic networks, highlighting condensates as active regulators of biochemical flux rather than as passive organizers.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Honeybee larvae are susceptible to Paenibacillus larvae, a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium that causes American Foulbrood (AFB), one of the most destructive brood diseases worldwide. Existing antibiotic treatments are undesirable due to increasing pathogen resistance and their residual accumulation in bee products. Consequently, there is increasing interest in biological agents and natural strategies for AFB control. However, most studies remain limited to in vitro or in vivo experiments and rarely evaluate impacts on adult bees. In this study, we systematically investigated hive-associated bacteria for their potential to enhance larval survival during P. larvae infection. Bacteria isolated from AFB-infected combs were sequenced and screened for antagonistic activity. Several Bacillus species-including B. zhangzhouensis, B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis, and B. mojavensis-inhibited one or more P. larvae strains. Notably, the lysate of B. licheniformis suppressed all tested strains; Further characterization revealed that its main antibacterial component consists of heat-stable proteins between 30-50 kDa. Two Bacillus strains were selected for larval infection assays using laboratory-reared honeybee larvae: both significantly improved survival by 42% and 71%, respectively. To evaluate potential effects on adult bees, newly emerged workers were caged and fed B. licheniformis ASx lysate. Their survival differed from that of untreated controls but remained comparable to the Terra-Pro-fed bees, a Terramycin-based AFB treatment, and their gut microbiome remained similar to that of untreated controls.

Plant specialized metabolites often play pivotal roles in this assembly process. However, the molecular basis underlying root microbiota responses to these bioactive compounds, and how such metabolic interactions shape the assembly of host-specific root microbiota, remain largely unknown. Nicotine is a toxic alkaloid predominantly produced by the genus Nicotiana, and the genus Arthrobacter is known as one of the nicotine-degrading bacteria in the tobacco root microbiota. In this study, we used the tobacco-Arthrobacter interaction system as a model and integrated comparative genomics and experimental genetic manipulation assays to uncover the role of bacterial catabolism capacity for host specialized metabolites in shaping host-specific root microbiota. Results: Nicotine catabolism genes are uniquely found in the Arthrobacter strains derived from nicotine-containing environments, and this restricted gene distribution is driven by a plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer. To assess the ecological consequences of this genomic adaptation in Arthrobacter fitness in tobacco roots, we conducted adaptation assays under both in vitro and in planta conditions using genetically manipulated Arthrobacter and tobacco mutants, which are impaired in nicotine catabolism and biosynthesis, respectively. Nicotine improves Arthrobacter colonization to the tobacco roots through both catabolism-dependent and catabolism-independent mechanisms. Bacterial community analysis using a synthetic community approach further demonstrated that these metabolic interactions, mediated by tobacco nicotine biosynthesis and its catabolism by Arthrobacter, jointly affect root microbiota composition. Conclusions: Our findings illustrated that bacterial catabolic capacity toward host-derived plant specialized metabolites is key for successful root colonization. This metabolic adaptation is driven by plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer and ultimately shapes the structure of the overall root microbiota community.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

One such aspect is the population dynamics of its nymphal stage, which has so far been reported from limited sample sizes, preventing the identification of its peak abundance. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a year long monthly survey at four locations in France representing three distinct climates. The sampling protocol based on the flagging method performed under bamboo bushes where larvae of this species had previously been found was designed to maximize the likelihood of capturing the nymphal stage. Based on the 400 nymphs collected during this survey, a clear peak of I. frontalis nymphs was observed around March (February to April) across all four sites, with an additional peak in August at one site. The population dynamics of the larval stage, based on semi quantitative counts, showed the same previously described pattern, with a peak in late autumn. Twenty adults (11 females and 9 males) were also collected from March to December, but these data did not allow a clear identification of a peak abundance. Because several bird species, such as blackbirds, song thrushes, European robins, and Eurasian blackcaps, serve as feeding hosts for both I. ricinus and I. frontalis, and are also reservoirs for pathogens transmitted by these ticks, the implications of our findings for the eco epidemiology of tick borne diseases are discussed.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

We profiled FGFR/FGF expression and evaluated the FGFR1-3 inhibitor infigratinib, both alone and in combination with standard agents, in models of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Methods: Twenty-eight cell lines (MCL n=10; MZL n=7, including BTK/PI3K inhibitor-resistant derivatives; ABC-DLBCL n=3; GCB-DLBCL n=8) were tested by 72-h MTT assays for single-agent and fixed-ratio combination activity. Transcriptome profiling (4, 8, 12 h) was performed in MZL Karpas1718 cells treated with infigratinib (500 nM), ibrutinib (10 nM), or the combination. Results: MCL preferentially expressed FGFR3/FGF9, whereas ABC-DLBCL and MZL expressed FGFR1/FGF2; FGFR1 was further enriched in resistant MZL models, consistent with autocrine activation. Infigratinib showed dose-dependent but modest single-agent activity across the panel (median IC50 3.58 M, indicating limited efficacy at clinically achievable exposures ([&le;]500 nM). However, combinations were broadly synergistic: in MCL, infigratinib with ibrutinib (4/4 lines) and bendamustine (5/5) outperformed either agent alone, with weaker effects with rituximab (2/4). In MZL (parental and resistant), infigratinib synergized with ibrutinib (6/6), copanlisib (6/6), and idelalisib (4/6), restoring sensitivity in resistant derivatives; synergy occurred at infigratinib concentrations [&le;]500 nM.

In contrast, the combination concomitantly downregulated NF-{kappa}B pathways and abrogated MYC target signatures, with coordinated modulation of apoptosis and DNA-repair transcripts. Conclusions: FGFR1/3-driven autocrine signaling contributes to adaptive survival in MCL and MZL.

Genetic and pharmacologic depletion of PARP14 (via siRNA knockdown, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout, or PROTAC-mediated degradation) significantly impaired EwS cell migration and invasion in vitro, without affecting proliferation or clonogenic capacity.

However, the exact mechanism, whether extracellular chemistry-mediated or cell-mediated, remains unclear. Here we focused on the extracellular milieu. Using fluorescence-labelled fetuin-A and a live imaging platform, we found that Mg reduced spontaneous mineral precipitation by stabilizing calcium and phosphate as colloidal protein-mineral particles (CPP) in calcification media containing up to 10 mM calcium and phosphate. Addition of 1.25-5 mM Mg progressively stabilized the protein-mineral particles in the fluid phase, increasing calcification. Dynamic light scattering revealed smaller and more numerous CPP at up to 4 mM Mg. At 10 mM Mg, no calcification occurred even with 10 mM added calcium and phosphate. This suggested a critical Mg concentration range in supersaturated calcification media, where Mg paradoxically enhanced calcification by stabilizing mineral precursors and increasing their availability. These findings demonstrate Mg dual role: an inhibitor of protein-mineral complex aggregation at high concentrations and a facilitator of mineral availability from colloidal protein-mineral phases at concentrations up to about 5 mM Mg.

Epidemiological, animal, and in vitro studies have consistently linked PFOA exposure to hepatotoxicity characterized by lipid dysregulation; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these adverse effects in humans remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we employed an integrated functional toxicogenomics framework combining CRISPR screening (for gene target identification), target validation, and assessment of target-derived cellular and molecular phenotypes. From genome-wide CRISPR screens in HepG2/C3A human liver cells, we identified 319 candidate genes (140 sensitive and 179 resistant) that modulate PFOA toxicity. Among these, C18orf32, encoding a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein and the top resistant candidate, was selected for further mechanistic investigation based on its potential functional involvement in lipid metabolism. Targeted knockout (KO) of C18orf32 conferred marked cellular resistance to PFOA, accompanied by reduced LD and Triglyceride accumulation in cells under the exposure condition, suggesting a functional role of C18orf32p in lipid dysregulation. To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular phenotypes, we conducted systematic transcriptomics profiling of wild-type (WT) and C18orf32 KO cells in the absence and presence of PFOA exposure. C18orf32 KO caused extensive gene expression reprogramming, with over one-third of coding genes differentially expressed. Notably, a range of lipid metabolism pathways including cholesterol metabolism, PPAR signaling, fatty acid metabolism, and peroxisome beta-oxidation, known mediators of PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity, were significantly downregulated in C18orf32 KO cells, contrasting to upregulation of these pathways in PFOA exposed WT cells. Collectively, our results identify C18orf32p as a previously unrecognized regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism and a key genetic determinant of PFOA-induced lipid dysregulation and hepatotoxicity in humans.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence suggests that these inflammatory changes may contribute to cardiac electrical instability and arrhythmia risk. However, the specific cytokines involved and their mechanistic pathways in domestic dogs remain poorly characterized. This study aimed to (1) identify key cytokines consistently associated with sleep deprivation through a systematic meta-analysis of the literature, and (2) perform a domestic dog-specific network and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to characterize their interactions and potential mechanistic links to arrhythmogenesis. Methods: A structured search of PubMed and Google Scholar identified 25 articles, of which 24 unique records were screened and seven met all inclusion criteria. From these studies, seven cytokines (IL-6, IL-17A, TNF, IL-1, IL-21, IFN-{gamma}, and CRP) were consistently associated with sleep deprivation and were subjected to domestic dog-specific protein-protein interaction analysis using the STRING database. Network topology and enriched biological processes were evaluated to identify mechanistic pathways connected to cardiac electrophysiology. Results: Network analysis revealed several highly interconnected signalling nodes, including IL-10, IL-1{beta}, JAK1, JAK2, IL-6, STAT3, TNF, IFN-{gamma}, IL-2, and IL-4. Enrichment analysis indicated activation of processes such as chemokine production, positive regulation of osteoclast differentiation, JAK-STAT signalling, membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis, and regulation of vitamin D metabolism. Integration of primary and secondary networks revealed three major clusters cantered on interleukin signalling, TNF-driven pathways, and CRP-associated acute-phase responses. Collectively, these pathways converge on cytokine-mediated mechanisms known to influence myocardial conduction and increase arrhythmia susceptibility. Conclusions: These findings suggest that sleep deprivation activates coordinated inflammatory networks that may predispose dogs to arrhythmias through multiple interconnected biological pathways. Therapeutic strategies addressing both inflammation and electrical instability may be required to fully manage arrhythmia risk in sleep-deprived canine patients.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Advances in metagenomics and synthetic biology, together with systems biology approaches combining mathematical modeling with experimental data, provide excellent opportunities to understand phage-bacteria dynamics. Here we analyze a mathematical model successfully calibrated using in vitro data on the multidrug-resistant bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae in the presence of the phage vB Kpn 2-P4. The model describes a system with a susceptible bacterial population that can generate phage-resistant mutants. By analyzing the equilibria and bifurcations of the model, we identify a coexistence scenario between phage-resistant bacteria and phages governed by a quasineutral line of equilibria with both stable and unstable segments. Biologically, this quasineutral structure implies that phage-resistant bacteria can persist across a wide range of phage densities without selective pressure favoring a unique outcome, making clearance highly sensitive to additional mortality mechanisms. The clearance of phage-resistant bacteria can be achieved by combining phage activity with an increased death rate of the resistant strains. This process is governed by a global transcritical bifurcation of the quasineutral line. Our model offers mechanistic insight into potential scenarios leading to the complete elimination of phage-resistant bacteria.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

GECIs are typically fluorescence-intensity sensors that change brightness upon calcium binding. Iterative improvements in GECIs have yielded indicators that report action potential-evoked calcium entry with high sensitivity and temporal resolution, enabling measurement of network activity across thousands of neurons. However, fluorescence intensity-based measurements generally cannot report baseline or absolute calcium levels and may confound neuromodulatory regulation of calcium handling with changes in action potential firing. Fluorescence lifetime sensors are insensitive to many artifacts that plague intensity-based measures and report absolute substrate levels, including those at rest. However, relatively few lifetime sensors for neuronal signals exist, and developing new sensors is typically difficult and low-yield. Here, we introduce a new rapid lifetime sensor development (RALISED) platform, which we use to build a new GCaMP8m-based high-speed lifetime calcium sensor, termed LifeCamp. We show that LifeCamp enables comparison of baseline calcium signals in cell culture, brain slices, and mice. In addition, we show that LifeCamp enables the detection of fast action potential-evoked calcium transients in single neurons from brain slices and in behaving mice. Using LifeCamp, we discovered calcium baseline changes associated with neuronal activity in brain slices and behaving mice, as well as slow average calcium changes in neuronal populations of freely moving mice. Altogether, this study highlights the utility of the RALISED method to rapidly develop new lifetime sensors and the application of the LifeCamp calcium lifetime sensor to study fast and slow calcium signaling.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

This approach aims to modulate DMD pre-mRNA splicing to re-frame the transcript and generate an internally deleted but partially functional quasi-dystrophin protein. Four exon skipping drugs have received FDA accelerated approval, although their clinical efficacy is very limited. To investigate how treatment timing influences exon skipping outcomes, dystrophin-deficient mdx mice were injected with peptide-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PPMO) exon skipping conjugates beginning at either the adult (12-week) or aged (75-week) stages, and tibialis anterior muscles harvested for biochemical and transcriptomic analyses. Mean Dmd exon 23 skipping was 79% in adults and 44% in aged PPMO-treated mdx mice, whereas dystrophin protein restoration was 35% and 8%, respectively. Histopathological improvements were only evident in the adult-treated mice. PPMO-treatment in adult mdx mice induced a broad transcriptomic shift towards a wild-type signature, whereas treatment in aged mice resulted in negligible gene expression changes, indicating that late intervention is ineffective at reversing disease-associated pathologies despite low-level dystrophin restoration. Dystrophin transcript imbalance was corrected only in adult-treated mdx mice. Increased expression of the dystrophin-repressing microRNA miR-31-5p, which was more strongly upregulated in aged mdx muscle, provides a potential mechanistic explanation. In conclusion, PPMO-mediated exon skipping is substantially more effective when initiated in adult rather than aged dystrophic muscle, supporting early therapeutic intervention in DMD-affected individuals.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

However, human monocytes can secrete IL-1{beta} in the absence of cell death, and the contribution of GSDMD in this secretory pathway is not established. Here, we identify two mechanisms of mature IL-1{beta} secretion by living human monocytic cells : a rapid, GSDMD-dependent pathway and a slower, GSDMD-independent pathway. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen, we identified XPR1 (Xenotropic and Polytropic retrovirus Receptor 1) as a key regulator of the GSDMD-independent pathway. XPR1 is the only phosphate exporter identified in metazoans and has no previously described function in cytokine secretion. XPR1 invalidation in GSDMD-/- monocytic cells impaired IL-1{beta} secretion. We further show that this regulatory function requires cell-surface expression of XPR1 and is linked to its phosphate export activity. Our results reveal a previously undescribed mechanism of IL-1{beta} secretion by living human monocytic cells, independent of GSDMD and unexpectedly linked to phosphate homeostasis. Deciphering this pathway could lead to new therapeutic modalities for IL-1{beta}-driven inflammatory diseases.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

CRISPR-Cas systems are classified based on their mechanism of action, with type I systems being the most prevalent in nature. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems target DNA, and require extensive complementarity between the crRNA and the target DNA. Moreover, type I systems require the presence of a \"Protospacer Adjacent Motif\" (PAM) sequence in the target DNA immediately adjacent to the expected region of base-pairing with the crRNA.

Here we show that native and regenerated cellulose, ranging from cotton and linen to viscose, modal, and lyocell, despite minor structural differences, are biodegraded at comparable rates, indicating that there is no scientifically justified distinction regarding environmental behavior. We assessed the biodegradation of diverse cellulosic materials, including powders, loose fibers, fabrics, and nonwovens, under technical and natural conditions across soil, home compost, freshwater, and marine coastal and deep-sea environments. Our study combined a total of 152 scenarios with laboratory tests, mesocosm and field experiments, spanning from polar to tropical regions and temperatures from -1.8 degree C in the high Arctic Ocean to 38.4 degree C in a marine beach in the Mediterranean Sea, and between -6.1 to 54.1 degree C in agricultural soil. All neat cellulosic fibers showed inherent biodegradability, with biodegradation half-lives typically ranging from weeks to months. Biodegradation rates were primarily driven by water availability, temperature, and nutrient levels, while the role of oxygen was indifferent. Standardized lab tests aligned well with field observations, confirming their validity for assessing inherent biodegradability with environmental relevance. However, biodegradation of biodegradable polymers in real-world scenarios is influenced by product-level modifications such as dyeing and finishing. By distinguishing the effects of fiber chemistry separately from those of finishing treatments, this study clarifies the role of cellulose in a sustainable materials economy and supports evidence-based regulation of fiber biodegradability claims and product labeling.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

During infection, the pathogen colonizes the subcuticular space and secretes hundreds of effectors to promote virulence. To mitigate disease impact, resistance genes such as Rvi6, which encodes a membrane-localized receptor-like protein, have been introduced into apple cultivars. However, over the past three decades, Rvi6-mediated resistance has been circumvented in orchards, with the emergence of virulent V. inaequalis strains. Through comparative genomics analyses and functional validation by complementation, we identified AvrRvi6 as the fungal determinant that activates Rvi6-mediated immunity. Screening 122 V. inaequalis strains worldwide we identified 20 distinct AvrRvi6 alleles. Evolution analysis demonstrated that the emergence of virulent alleles predates the domestication of apple thus revealing that wild Malus species constitute a reservoir of virulence. Using AlphaFold structural modeling, we showed that AvrRvi6 belongs to an expanded family that adopts a MAX effector fold, originally described for cytoplasmic effectors of the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated that AvrRvi6 triggers allele-specific apoplastic immunity and validated three different molecular mechanisms (mutation, partial deletion and transposon insertion in the promoter) to circumvent Rvi6 recognition.

In Gram-negative bacteria, especially in pathogens, desiccation is known to impose multifactorial stress, including loss of cellular water and energetics, damage to DNA and proteins, oxidative stress, and disruption of the cell envelope. However, for chassis strains used in or being considered for gas-phase bioprocesses, their desiccation tolerance and responses to desiccation stress remain incompletely defined. Results: Here, we evaluated the viability, energy status, and gas-phase toluene degradation of Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 as a chassis for gas-phase processes after controlled desiccation (8%, 52%, and >95% RH), in comparison with Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli. To minimize adhesion-related bias in post-desiccation measurements, we used an ataA-deficient Tol 5 mutant (Tol 5 {Delta}ataA) for the assays. Acinetobacter strains maintained high viability during desiccation for 16 days, whereas P. putida and E. coli showed significant loss of viability at 8% RH and 52% RH. Intracellular ATP measurements further indicated that desiccation reduced intracellular ATP in all strains, but E. coli rapidly exhausted ATP at 8% and 52% RH, whereas Acinetobacter strains and P. putida retained intracellular ATP.

W.; Ni, M.; Fang, G.; Shen, A.", "abstract": "DNA methylation is a widespread phenomenon in bacteria that can regulate gene expression, although the mechanisms underlying this epigenetic regulation are often poorly understood. In Clostridioides difficile, the orphan DNA methyltransferase CamA promotes sporulation, a process critical for the persistence and transmission of this nosocomial pathogen. However, the specific CamA target genes that drive this increased sporulation phenotype were unknown. Here, we show that methylation of a single CamA motif in the promoter region of spoIIE, which encodes a factor critical for activating the early-acting sporulation sigma factor {sigma}F, is sufficient to promote spoIIE transcription, {sigma}F activation, and spore formation. Surprisingly, the CamA-dependent increase in spoIIE expression also increases the frequency of premature {sigma}F activation prior to asymmetric division, resulting in miscompartmentalization of {sigma}F activity. While this premature activation event triggers cell lysis in the well-studied spore-former Bacillus subtilis, we show that C. difficile cells retain developmental plasticity: predivisional cells that have prematurely activated {sigma}F can abort sporulation and resume vegetative growth, whereas cells that activate {sigma}F in the forespore after asymmetric division remain committed to sporulation. Thus, DNA methylation controls a critical cell fate decision in C. difficile without compromising its capacity to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. Finally, we show that CamA confers a significant fitness advantage during murine infection through mechanisms largely independent of its ability to promote sporulation. Since CamA is specific to C. difficile and epigenetically regulates multiple pathways critical for pathogen persistence, these analyses imply that CamA could be a promising antimicrobial target.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we use live-cell time-lapse imaging to show that chains arise from single cells that elongate and divide without separation. Under flow, chains resist detachment and undergo shear-dependent fragmentation at cell-cell junctions, releasing viable clonal units that disperse downstream. Comparative genomics reveals substantial diversity among EibG-related adhesins and identifies distinct lineages, including chain-like adhesins (cla) that mediate CLAP while lacking IgG binding. Screening of 1,354 LEE-negative STEC genomes from England shows that claB is present in 95.6% of strains from major LEE-negative STEC serotypes, highlighting its epidemiological prevalence. Targeted mutagenesis demonstrates that chain formation and IgG binding are mediated by distinct structural domains, revealing the modular functional architecture of these adhesins.

L.", "abstract": "Biologging has transformed ecological research, yet studying the at-sea behaviour of small seabirds remains challenging due to trade-offs between device size and data resolution. Miniature GPS devices (<1 g) have been deployed on storm-petrels but their coarse temporal resolution limits behavioural classification, particularly resting. Accelerometers offer detailed behavioural data but lack spatial context, and some species are too small to simultaneously carry both devices. We deployed GPS devices on breeding European storm-petrels, including a subset recently developed with integrated accelerometers. Using accelerometer-informed rest periods, we developed a semi-supervised three-state Hidden Markov Model to classify transiting, foraging, and resting across all GPS tracks, even those without accelerometer data. Detection of resting behaviour by the semi-supervised model improved substantially compared to an unsupervised GPS-only model which only identified 17% of true resting events. Resulting time-activity budgets closely matched accelerometer-only studies, validating behaviour classifications, while also providing spatial context. Foraging peaked in the early hours of the night, whereas resting was most frequent in the afternoon. This is the first application of a combined GPS-accelerometer approach to a small storm-petrel species. Our method improves behavioural classification in small seabirds, providing new insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of their at-sea behaviour.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

J. O.; James, R.", "abstract": "Robustness is a useful metric in evaluating the ability of an ecosystem to resist further extinction after species loss. This measure is straightforward to calculate from empirical interaction data, however doing so typically requires a static network of time-aggregated interactions, ignoring the finer-scale variation imposed by species phenologies. Although the analysis of time-aggregated ecological networks has been successful in capturing their overall structure, it often leads to the loss of information of the within-season variation that ecosystems typically exhibit. We demonstrate how this approach can also dramatically overestimate robustness by assuming all interactions are concurrent. Here, we develop a new measure of temporal robustness that incorporates the time-varying nature of species interactions. We apply our measure to plant-pollinator systems using both simulated and empirical networks, and obtain analytical predictions for the temporal robustness of randomly generated networks. In each case, our analysis reveals a substantial loss of information in the established static-network robustness measure, which obscures the crucial role of phenology in determining the vulnerability of pollinators to species loss. We find that pollinators active over long time periods appear more robust after time-aggregation, but typically have a much lower temporal robustness, indicating that long-lived pollinators may be more vulnerable to plant loss than previously thought.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

K.; Barazandeh, M.; Hitchens, L.; Giaever, G.; Nislow, C.", "abstract": "Tardigrades are among the most resilient eukaryotes known, capable of surviving a wide range of extreme conditions. While their genomes contain thousands of tardigrade-specific genes, one key contributor to their stress resistance is the Damage suppressor (Dsup) protein. Previous work showed that expression of Dsup in cancer cells reduced DNA damage caused by X-rays. This observation has sparked growing interest in Dsup across diverse model organisms. Most studies to date have focused on phenotypic outcomes, while the mechanisms and consequences of Dsup remain poorly understood. Deciphering its mechanism is crucial, especially because Dsup expression is deleterious to some cells and organisms. In this work, we show that Dsup protects yeast against a variety of DNA-damaging agents. However, this protection is not universal, and it has a fitness cost. Analysis of nucleosome occupancy of cells expressing Dsup shows that effects on chromatin are modest, without global remodeling, and transcriptome analysis reveals a robust induction of oxidative stress pathways, which might be a form of preconditioning for oxidative stress. Genome-wide screens of ~4300 loss-of-function mutants expressing Dsup shows that deletions incompatible with Dsup are highly enriched for DNA repair processes and that under DNA damage stress, Dsup can protect some mutants in a pathway-specific manner. Our findings demonstrate that while Dsup broadly enhances resistance to genotoxic stress, it also imposes physiological costs and generates new dependencies on DNA repair and genome maintenance pathways.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Yet their evolutionary history in mammals remains poorly resolved, largely due to incomplete genome-wide annotation and the difficulties in establishing miRNA orthology. Using a homology-based framework paired with genome synteny for orthology assignment, we characterised miRNA families and investigated their evolutionary dynamics across mammals. Compared to Infernal and MirMachine using a consensus pseudo-ground-truth framework, our method demonstrated better sensitivity-specificity balance, allowing divergent miRNA detection while reducing false positives. Analysis of 73 mammalian genomes revealed major miRNA family gains at the ancestral nodes of Eutheria, Marsupialia, and Haplorrhini, contrasted with substantial losses in Eulipotyphla and Scandentia. Copy number evolution was largely conserved across families, with only a few families (e.g., MIR-145, MIR-2285) showing lineage-specific duplication acceleration. Comparative genome microsynteny further resolved orthology for the multi-copy family LET-7, spanning eight deeply conserved syntenic blocks, as well as for 143 individual miRNAs. We showed that most miRNAs are deeply conserved, with the seed region being most constrained, followed by the mature, star, and loop regions. Within the seed region, positions 4-6 displayed higher conservation than other seed positions, consistent with their roles in core target recognition. Ancestral seed-state reconstruction further revealed diverse evolutionary signatures, including ancestral shifts, recurrent substitutions, and homoplasious changes. Collectively, these findings provide an unprecedented comparative overview of mammalian miRNA evolution and create new opportunities to investigate how shifts in miRNA repertoires and sequence features may underlie lineage-specific regulatory and phenotypic diversification.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Rare familial mutations can modulate a-Syn aggregation and may give rise to distinct fibril conformations linked to disease heterogeneity. The E83Q mutation, identified in a Dementia with Lewy Body disease (DLB) patient with atypical Lewy body distribution, has been shown to accelerate a-Syn aggregation and enhance neuronal seeding, yet its structural basis remains unclear. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure at 3.4 Angstrom resolution of recombinant full-length human a-Syn fibrils harboring the E83Q mutation. The fibrils adopt a double-protofilament architecture with a conserved Greek-key-like core spanning residues 36-99, stabilized by intra- and inter-filament salt bridges. Despite this conserved fold, the E83Q mutation induces a distinct local rearrangement within the hydrophobic region: substitution of Glu83 with Gln reorients residue 83 inward, abolishing solvent exposure and altering interactions with the N-terminal region. This structural shift brings the hydrophobic region closer to the N-terminus, shielding residues implicated in post-translational modification and ligand binding.

Trypanosoma brucei is an African trypanosome that can lose kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), however, when the nuclear-encoded gamma subunit of the mitochondrial F1FO-ATP synthase (gATPase) is mutated. These mutations, analogous to a broken camshaft at the core of the ATP synthase rotary motor, are associated with multidrug resistance, and correlated with tsetse-fly independent mechanical transmission, and geographical spread of these parasites beyond Africa. Here we engineer kinetoplast-independent T. brucei to explore origins and consequences of kDNA loss. We used oligo targeting to edit the native gATPase gene, and selection with the ATP synthase targeting drug oligomycin to enrich the desired mutants. Using this approach, we identified novel M282F, M282W, and M282Y mutants, and subsequently generated precision-edited strains expressing the previously described L262P or A273P mutants, or the novel M282F mutant. HeterozygousM282F mutants retained sensitivity to the kDNA-targeting drug acriflavine, while homozygous M282F mutants were acriflavine resistant and readily tolerated acriflavine-induced kDNA loss. Proteomics analysis of the homozygous mutant pre-kDNA-loss revealed highly specific depletion of ATP synthase-associated proteins, but not the F1 subunits. Complete kDNA-loss in these cells was associated with substantial depletion of kDNA-binding proteins and mitochondrial RNA-processing factors. In contrast, mitochondrial membrane-associated transporters were increased in abundance. We conclude that T. brucei cells with a homozygous gATPase M282F mutation assemble a remodelled ATP synthase and readily tolerate kDNA loss, which is accompanied by substantial remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Bacterial two-hybrid assays revealed specific protein-protein interactions within the tle1 locus, involving the immunity protein Tli1a, the chaperone/adaptor Tla1, and the spike protein VgrG4a. These interactions were independently validated by co-purification assays. Structural modeling with AlphaFold 3 produced a high-confidence ternary complex in which a VgrG4a trimer accommodates one Tle1 monomer and one Tla1 monomer.

Furthermore, modeling of the Tle1-Tli1a complex suggests an inhibition mechanism that does not occlude the catalytic pocket.

In bacteria, intrinsic termination, mediated by an RNA hairpin followed by a polyuridine tract (polyU), is a principal mechanism. Because RNA secondary structures are destabilized at high temperature, whether intrinsic termination functions effectively in thermophiles has been uncertain. We mapped RNA 3' termini genome-wide in the extreme thermophile Thermus aquaticus (Taq) grown at 70 0C using Term-Seq. Computational analysis identified hairpins upstream of most termini. These hairpins were substantially more thermally stable than those of the mesophile Escherichia coli. RNA 3' ends were also detected within coding regions, consistent with transcriptional pausing or premature termination at spurious hairpins in GC-rich transcripts. In vitro transcription showed that native Taq terminators direct efficient intrinsic termination by Taq RNA polymerase at 70 0C and require both hairpin and polyU. Termination remained efficient up to 80 0C. At this temperature, the terminator hairpin RNA is unfolded in solution, indicating that RNA polymerase promotes hairpin formation during transcription.

How such variability emerges and how it relates to fertilizing potential remain unresolved, in part because sperm subpopulations are typically analyzed independently despite being intrinsically interdependent. Here, we combine large-scale single-cell spectral flow cytometry with compositional statistical modeling to quantify how sperm population structure responds to controlled capacitation signals in vitro. Using cauda epididymal mouse sperm, we implemented a two-dimensional assay that systematically varies extracellular bicarbonate and free calcium - key regulators of capacitation - and classified millions of individual cells into four irreversible physiological states defined by cell viability and acrosome reaction status. We show that bicarbonate and calcium interact nonlinearly to redistribute sperm across these subpopulations, revealing structured responses that would be otherwise obscured in measurements lacking single-cell resolution. Elevated intracellular calcium was associated with increased cell death, while the highest proportions of live, acrosome-reacted sperm occurred under relatively low extracellular calcium conditions. To enable subpopulation-level analysis, we applied a hierarchical Dirichlet-multinomial regression model that accounts for multinomial sampling noise and between-male variability, yielding posterior probability surfaces that describe how sperm subpopulations reallocate across functional states as microenvironmental signaling conditions change. Together, these results demonstrate that capacitation is a stochastic, cell-population level process shaped by structured phenotypic heterogeneity.

MASLD is a progressive and multifactorial disease marked initially by hepatic steatosis, which can progress to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Genetic factors influence the development, progression, and complications in MASLD, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with altered risk. Mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 1 (MTARC1) rs2642438 (p.A165T) variant has been identified as protective, but the role of MTARC1 and the impact of this variant in hepatocytes remains poorly understood. Here, we applied prime editing to create the rs2642438 variant in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) before differentiation into human liver organoids (HLOs) to investigate the effect of the variant under conditions of steatotic and fibrotic injury. Compared to HLOs formed from hPSCs containing the MTARC1 reference sequence, HLOs with the rs2642438 variant show lower levels of MTARC1 protein and triglycerides and are protected from steatotic and fibrotic injury, as predicted by the phenotype observed in patients carrying the variant. The observed decrease in triglyceride level with the variant appears to be driven more by suppression of de novo lipogenesis rather than stimulation in B-oxidation in the HLO model. While resmetirom, the thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THRB) agonist approved to treat patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) was effective in reducing triglyceride levels in the setting of steatotic injury in HLOs with the reference sequence, HLOs containing the variant did not show further reduction in triglyceride levels with exposure to resmetirom, despite increased expression of THRB. Together, this study establishes an approach to model disease-related SNPs in HLOs and provides further insights into the activity of the MTARC1 variant, and suggests that profiling SNPs may be a path to identify patients more likely to respond to therapies for MASLD.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

To remain attached, it must maintain its structural integrity under force, but to what extent and how it does so remain unclear.

Kinetochore shape changes can be asymmetric, with centromere-facing tails correlating with erroneous attachment geometries. Applying microneedle pulling forces, we demonstrate that kinetochores are elastic, stretching under force and relaxing in seconds afterwards. Finally, we show that SMC2 depletion results in more variable kinetochore deformations, despite maintained elasticity, and in reduced microtubule attachment stability. Thus, the kinetochore is structurally highly dynamic and requires a stable centromere base to maintain its structure and function under force. We propose a model whereby individual protein linkages are stiff yet global kinetochore structure flexible to accommodate different attachment geometries and forces while maintaining function.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

F.; Zampetti, A.; Santini, L.", "abstract": "1. Understanding the impact of noise pollution on wildlife is challenging due to the complexity of isolating the anthropogenic components from the soundscape. Soundscape studies usually employ acoustic indices that apply arbitrary thresholds to isolate anthrophony from natural sounds. However, natural and anthropogenic sounds do not always conform to these thresholds, hindering both accuracy and comparability of the resulting indices. While significant progress has been made in automated identification of acoustic events through artificial intelligence-based classifiers, an effective method to quantify anthropogenic acoustic pressure is still lacking. 2. We propose a novel index, the Selective Anthropogenic Noise Exposure (SANE), which leverages BirdNET deep neural network to isolate human-related sounds from recordings. The index consists in the sum of the Median Amplitude Index of all human noise categories, thereby capturing both the intensity and cumulative impact of multiple disturbance events, while also enabling the decomposition of noise level across different categories of disturbance (e.g., traffic, human voices). 3. We test performance of the SANE in a real urban setting and through soundscape simulations and compare it with two frequency-based indices and another artificial intelligence-based acoustic index. SANE was effective in describing human noises within areas characterized by different levels of urbanization, improving upon other indices' shortcomings. Additionally, SANE was robust at very fine temporal scales, precisely quantifying anthrophony levels for single recordings. Among the indices considered, SANE was the only one that remained insensitive to low-frequency biophony, which confounded both frequency and artificial intelligence-based metrics. 4. By leveraging the ability to detect multiple human-made sound classes of artificial intelligence-based classifier, SANE index captures the intensity of anthropogenic noise while being insensitive to non-conforming natural sounds to the traditionally identified anthrophony range. Furthermore, SANE has the potential to assess the relative contribution of different noise types to the overall acoustic pollution, opening new research avenues on the acoustic pollution effects on wildlife in high disturbance contexts.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

However, the residual activity of these enzymes in the whey by-product limits downstream processing for further food applications, e.g. infant milk formulations or protein powder for athletic purposes. To date, inactivation of coagulants and other enzymes is primarily achieved through heat inactivation (pasteurisation), which remains a challenging and energy-intensive task at an industrial scale and may have adverse effects on the quality. Here, we report the de novo design of small protein minibinders (miBds) that inhibit coagulant activity which marks one of the first industrial applications of generative binder design. Using RFdiffusion1, ProteinMPNN2, and AlphaFold23, we generated and filtered over 2,000 backbone designs to a final panel of 63 candidates targeting bovine and camel chymosins. The first round of selected binders exhibited low-nanomolar Kiapp 4,5 values against chymosins originating from bovine, camel, and hedgehog, with reversible, pH-dependent dissociation profiles. Notably, we identified miBds specific to bovine and camel chymosin variants, as well as broadly cross-reactive including coagulants of fungal origin. Moreover, when immobilised, the miBds efficiently removed residual chymosin from whey. It was possible to recycle the miBd-coated resin repeatedly through treatment of the resin with high pH (> 11) or low pH (< 3) which emulates industry standard clean-in-place procedures.

Second, leveraging these data and performing targeted experiments, we uncovered cells that lack most or all canonical clock components yet display strong mRNA rhythms. We found that lamina wide-field neurons show high-amplitude tim mRNA cycling even in constant darkness conditions (DD) despite minimal expression of other clock genes, suggesting a partial or noncanonical oscillator. In addition, C2 and C3 optic lobe neurons, which do not express core clock components, exhibit hundreds of circadian and daily cycling transcripts. Notably, circadian rhythms in C3 neurons coincide with oscillations of activity-regulated genes (ARGs), whereas C2 neurons cycle independently of ARGs, indicating distinct non-cell-autonomous mechanisms.

To determine where and when multisensory signals are integrated within the cortical hierarchy, we trained mice in a visuotactile evidence-accumulation task and used widefield and two-photon calcium imaging together with optogenetic perturbations to map cortical circuits. Mice showed enhanced performance in multisensory trials that matched an additive combination of the total unisensory evidence. Cortical imaging also revealed superadditive multisensory responses in parietal and frontal regions, but visual and tactile evidence was accumulated in distinct regions, with the rostrolateral visual area (RL) being more selective for visual and the frontal medial motor cortex (MM) for tactile inputs. This modality-specific segregation persisted beyond stimulus presentation with convergence into a modality-independent choice emerging only late in the trial in the anterolateral motor cortex (ALM). Two-photon imaging confirmed that ALM neurons predominantly encoded modality-independent choices with few neurons responding to specific sensory stimuli. Optogenetic inactivation of RL and frontal cortex during the stimulus or choice period further validated their respective roles in sensory evidence accumulation and choice formation.

T.", "abstract": "Brain capillaries sense neural activity and direct blood flow to active regions--a process termed neurovascular coupling that underlies activity-dependent increases in local perfusion (functional hyperemia). A key contributor to functional hyperemic responses is the capillary endothelial cell (cEC) inward rectifier K+ (Kir2.1) channel, which is activated by neuronal activity-derived extracellular K+ and initiates vasodilatory electrical signals that propagate through the vascular network. Kir2.1 channel function requires continual production of its lipid cofactor, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and is compromised in mouse models of cerebral small vessel (cSVD). Although decreased PIP2 availability is a common feature of cSVD, mechanisms underlying PIP2 synthesis remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that Arf6, a small GTPase expressed in cECs that stimulates PIP2 production, is critical for this process. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrate that inhibiting Arf6 activity progressively decreased cEC Kir2.1 channel activity. This deficit corresponded to loss of capillary-to-arteriole electrical signaling in isolated vessels and diminished functional hyperemia in vivo. Exogenously provided PIP2 restored Kir2.1 currents and functional hyperemia after Arf6 inhibition or genetic knockdown. Collectively, our data indicate that cEC Arf6 sustains Kir2.1 activity by maintaining PIP2 levels and demonstrate that diminished PIP2 synthesis is sufficient to impair functional hyperemia. Furthermore, we identify Arf6 as a mechanistic link between PIP2 production and endothelial electrical signaling, highlighting Arf6 as a potential therapeutic target for restoring functional hyperemia.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

D.; Schriever, S. C.; Pfluger, P. T.", "abstract": "Background: The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a rare, X-linked human genetic disorder caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), essential for thyroid hormone (TH) transport across the blood-brain-barrier. The resulting central TH deprivation disrupts brain maturation and function, leading to intellectual disability and movement disorders. Cortical development, highly dependent on TH, is particularly affected and contributes significantly to AHDS pathologies. Methods: To elucidate disrupted cortical processes, we conducted single nucleus RNA sequencing in a mouse model engineered to mimic the central TH deficiency characteristic of human AHDS. This murine AHDS model features the concomitant deletion of both MCT8 and OATP1C1, a T4 transporter largely absent in human brain capillaries that in mice plays a role in TH transport. The phenotype of dKO mice bears striking resemblance to the pathologies observed in human AHDS patients. Results: Single nuclei were isolated from the cortex and attached striatum of 21-day old WT and MCT8/OATP1C1 dKO mice and sequenced using the 10x Genomics workflow. Cell proportion analyses on the resulting 48 clusters suggested elevated numbers of GABAergic striatal D1 and D2 neurons in the dKO mice. Diminished levels of mature oligodendrocytes coincided with a bifurcation within the oligodendrocyte lineage trajectory, leading to distinct subpopulations of WT and dKO oligodendrocytes. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) patterns align poorly with Slc16a2 and Slco1c1 mRNA levels in the respective clusters, but closely with prior published cortical bulk RNAseq data of mice with systemic hypothyroidism or MCT8/OATP1C1 deficiency. These parallels confirm the reliability of our data and provide new insights by pinpointing TH-responsive DEGs to specific cellular clusters. Moreover, inferred cell-cell communication using NeuronChat suggested a disbalance in GABAergic versus glutamatergic signaling. We further uncovered perturbed primary cilia formation in several GABAergic and glutamatergic clusters of the dKO cortex. Discussion: Molecular signatures and perturbations uncovered by our snRNAseq study reveal new molecular characteristics of the AHDS. The imbalance in GABAergic versus glutamatergic cell-cell-communication, perturbed primary cilia formation, and bifurcation of the oligodendrocyte lineage align with pathologies observed in AHDS patients and highlight the role of TH signaling in maintaining neuronal network homeostasis in the cortex.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Electrocorticography in awake rats exhibited homologous temporal weighting, and analogous profiles for amplitude changes and visual motion demonstrated cross-feature and cross-modal generality. To uncover circuit mechanisms, we recorded single units along the inferior colliculus-medial geniculate body-auditory cortex pathway together with laminar local field potentials in A1. Onset-locked suppression of change responses emerged in midbrain and was progressively amplified in thalamus and cortex, whereas the full start-end profile was expressed in granular-layer alpha-gamma power. A simple biophysically grounded model in which onset responses saturate and cortical populations integrate over finite temporal windows recapitulates this pattern, explaining how stimulus boundaries disrupt prospective and retrospective integration and thereby degrade change detection near the beginning and end of sounds.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

TOR complexes regulate the ESCRT system to integrate nutrient availability with cell division. TOR activity is frequently deregulated in cancer, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Deregulated ESCRT activity has also been associated with cancer, but its role in mediating drug resistance is not fully understood. Herein, we have investigated the role of the ESCRT system in regulating sensitivity to Torin1. Methods: Growth assays were used to monitor the growth of yeast cells. The effect of Torin1 on protein expression was monitored by immunoblotting. Fluorescence microscopy was used to investigate the action of Torin1 on protein localization. Results: The ESCRT system mediates Torin1-induced degradation of amino acid and glucose transporters. The expression of these transporters at the plasma membrane is not abolished in ESCRT mutants. Mutants unable to effectively ubiquitylate these transporters are also resistant to Torin1. Impaired ESCRT-mediated protein degradation is associated with strong resistance to Torin1. Conclusions: Mutations in genes encoding ESCRT components have been reported in cancer. We present evidence that compromised ESCRT signalling is sufficient for resistance to Torin1.

The SMN protein is ubiquitously expressed and has several roles in the cell, including the regulation of RNA metabolism and genome stability. Although SMA is primarily considered a motor neuron disease, because of its ubiquitous expression, loss of SMN leads to systemic pathological consequences, including in skeletal muscle. To better understand the cell-intrinsic effects of SMN loss on myoblast differentiation, we characterized three human SMA Type II myoblast cell lines and controls in vitro. We observed impaired myogenic differentiation, including reduced fusion index and nuclei alignment. RNA sequencing analysis on the SMA myoblasts revealed activation of DNA damage pathways and innate immune activation, confirmed by the presence of 53BP1 foci and increased phosphorylation of the H2AX histones, as well as accumulation of R-loop structures and an increase of single-stranded DNA in the cytoplasm. Resolution of R-loops and DNA damage is known to cause the presence of immunogenic DNA: RNA species in the cytoplasm, activating sterile inflammation pathways. Treating control myoblasts with double-stranded DNA or a cGAS agonist phenocopied the differentiation defects in SMA myotubes. Conversely, treating SMA myoblasts with a STING inhibitor improved fusion. In summary, our results demonstrate that SMN loss exerts a cell-intrinsic impairment in muscle precursor cells, suggesting that the observed muscle dysfunction in Type II patients is not only a consequence of impaired innervation but also of the sterile inflammation caused by the genomic instability after SMN loss.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

From 211 annual samples collected according to highly standardized procedures at 13 sites, we detected 63 fish and lamprey species and traced their spatio-temporal trajectories. eDNA metabarcoding captured significantly declining trends at multiple sites with no recoveries. Common and sensitive species declined at nearly half of sites while invasive species spread. Site occupancy and relative read abundance trends were correlated, providing semi-quantitative indicators. Alpha and beta diversity shifted over time and Bayesian hierarchical models revealed that 19% of species showed significant declines in relative read abundance. The eDNA-derived trends showed strong concordance with long-term regulatory fish monitoring data, validating the patterns across methodological approaches. Random forest models and multivariate analyses identified multiple anthropogenic pollutants, measured from the same SPM samples, as drivers of biodiversity patterns.

Collectively, colonies may use a variety of strategies to minimize the impact of such perturbations of the foraging process. Here, we investigated how individual Solenopsis xyloni ant workers react to perturbation of an established pheromone trail. We trained foragers from colonies in the field to either a low or high concentration sucrose solution in a feeder on a T-maze setup, then replaced a section of floor covering, removing a section of the pheromone trail previously laid. We found that while ants made correct choices on the T-maze when the trail was intact, their choices did not differ from chance when the trail was absent, indicating strong reliance on a pheromone trail (and not, for example, memory) to return to the resource. Moreover, when the trail was absent, we found that a majority of ants abandoned the resource, and that even the ants that were able to reach the resource did not repair the perturbed trail. However, with a high-quality resource, more ants persisted in attempting to reach it (instead of abandoning). We interpret these responses in the framework of robustness mechanisms discussed in systems biology.

Microfluidic mixers provide a unique environment for the precise and continuous generation of nanoparticles by antisolvent precipitation. A major challenge is to understand the influence of microfluidic channel designs and geometries on the continuous production of small, uniform lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and to identify conditions that ensure effective and controllable mixing of aqueous and organic phases in laminar flows. Another important challenge is that sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical studies must be produced within a reasonable period of time. With this dual objective, different versions of a low aspect ratio laminar mixer (LARLM) were produced using two-photon polymerization (2PP). In the LARLM the organic phase forms a thin layer a few micrometers with a uniform velocity distribution in the center of the channel, surrounded by the aqueous phase. This concept has three major advantages: Firstly, it keeps all particles centralized in the channel, thus preventing contamination during prolonged particle generation. Secondly, diffusive mixing in the thin central stream occurs very quickly, and thirdly, the growing nanoparticles move at a homogeneous speed, which enables inline measurement of the particles. In systematic experiments with design versions of varied channel dimensions the operational parameters such as lipid concentrations and flow rates and the capability to produce LNPs with desired properties and loading capacities were explored. An interfacial dispersion model (IDM) could explain the surprising reduction of particle sizes with increased productivity. The latter allowed us to produce nanoparticles in the range of 50 nm to 180 nm (with 0.02 < PDI < 0.1) under stable conditions with a productivity of around one liter of LNP suspensions every three hours. Such performance has never been reached before with microfluidics. Moreover, LNPs loaded with coumarine-6 and various drugs were produced in the LARLM. Moreover, in-vitro experiments could confirm an improved bioavailability of coumarin-6 in cell culture experiments when loaded in LNPs by the LARLM. These results highlight the unique capabilities of LARLM devices and their potential to support nanoparticle formulation studies including preclinical and in further developments also clinical studies as required for approval as a marketable medicine.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

To address this challenge, we introduce Deep learning guided Adaptive sampling with seed Selection and Hopping (DASH), integrating both deep learning and physical functions to guide molecular dynamics (MD) simulation towards FMS. DASH successfully sampled NS [-&gt;] FMS transitions in 18 cases across two tasks: protein activation and cryptic allosteric site opening. DASH combined with secondary-structure collective variables is further able to sample folding of disordered regions. Compared to existing methods, DASH demonstrates superior performance while requiring comparable simulation time. Crucially, we applied DASH to sample new conformations of proteins, by which revealing new folding states, previously unknown allosteric sites, and potential activators. These predictions have been further verified in wet-lab experiments and crystal structures determinations.

By shifting the focus from individual genes to the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the genome, we identify the mineral dust-induced gene (mdig) as a chromatin-topology regulator that suppresses immune-checkpoint activation and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Re-expression of mdig in mdig-knockout (KO) cells markedly reduced liver metastasis, whereas mdig loss activated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), T-cell exhaustion, and antigen-presentation pathways. Across multiple cancer types, high mdig expression predicted improved responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Mechanistically, mdig depletion derepressed inhibitory checkpoint genes, including PD-L1, PD-L2, LGALS9, and PLXNB1/2, accompanied by increased H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 at these loci. Hi-C profiling revealed that mdig maintains topologically associating domains (TADs) and long-range repressive loops at checkpoint loci; loss of mdig disrupted these structures, enabling coordinated activation of immune-evasion programs. Genome-wide analyses showed extensive TAD remodeling in mdig KO cells, with pronounced alterations on chromosome X. Collectively, these findings position mdig as a key chromatin-architectural regulator of immune evasion and metastatic behavior, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for ICB responsiveness in TNBC and beyond.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Standard therapy for GBM includes surgery followed by ionizing radiation and treatment with temozolomide, a DNA alkylating agent. Unfortunately, even with aggressive treatments with these modalities, the median survival time for most GBM patients is less than 16 months. This study examines a new treatment strategy by combining doxorubicin, a soluble DNA-damaging agent that produces double-stranded DNA like ionizing radiation, with an artificial nucleoside designated 5-nitroindolyl-2-deoxyriboside (5-NIdR) that inhibits the misreplication of DNA lesions produced by the drug. Cell-based studies with grade 3 and grade 4 astrocytomas demonstrate that combining 5-NIdR with doxorubicin improves the cell-killing effects of the drug by increasing apoptosis. Flow cytometry experiments demonstrate that 5-NIdR does not increase the level of reactive oxygen species produced by doxorubicin. Instead, the increase in cell death produced by combining the two agents likely reflects inhibiting the replication of damaged DNA. Consistent with this mechanism, cell-cycle experiments demonstrate that this combination blocks cells at Go/G1, suggesting that 5-NIdR interferes with DNA polymerase activity during the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. The ability of 5-NIdR to inhibit double-strand DNA break repair could be extended to other modalities used to treat brain cancer such as ionizing radiation. Furthermore, the chemosensitizing effect of 5-NIdR could improve the overall efficacy of doxorubicin by lowering the risk of side effects caused by the DNA-damaging agent.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

However, since any artificial intelligence can make mistakes, strategies for identifying and correcting faulty annotations are often indispensable. Yet, how can such a validation be achieved without the laborious task of a pathologist manually checking every single image? To address this issue, the current project performed an extensive study on the use of shape analysis to automatically evaluate the glomerular annotations produced by deep-learning segmentation. Examining a large repertoire of shape descriptors on over 168000 glomerular predictions, the study found that morphometry could successfully highlight and distinguish between three different types of segmentation inconsistencies. In addition, using shape descriptors to rank segmentation annotations, it was possible to obtain a distinct enrichment of errors on the leading edge of the ranking, implying that pathologists would only have to inspect and correct the most suspicious fraction of all annotations. Ultimately, the study suggested a panel of three shape descriptors that enabled an efficient enrichment of all errors, respective or irrespective of error type. In summary, the work demonstrates the methodological aspects and benefits of shape analysis for evaluating glomerular segmentation results. We are convinced that, by applying such a strategy for detecting segmentation errors, it will be possible to approach a more time-efficient correction of deep learning-derived glomerular annotations.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Conventional section-based imaging restricts spatial context and volumetric analysis, making it challenging to map NP distribution in structurally complex organs such as the brain, even with fluorescent labeling. To address these limitations, we developed an integrated workflow combining tissue optical clearing (SeeDB2G) with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), enabling three-dimensional visualization of fluorescently labeled polystyrene (PS) NPs in neonatal mouse brains. At postnatal day 0 - a critical window of heightened vulnerability due to immature barrier systems and rapid neurodevelopment - pups were orally administered spherical PSNPs of 50 or 500 nm. Fluorescence stereoscopic imaging revealed pronounced organ-level accumulation of 50 nm PSNPs in the intestine, liver, kidney, and brain, compared with markedly lower signals from 500 nm PSNPs 24 h post-exposure. Optical clearing rendered the entire brain transparent while preserving fluorescence, allowing LSFM to accurately assess regional PSNP accumulation without sectioning. This workflow enabled whole-brain visualization of size-dependent NP uptake, with 50 nm PSNP detected throughout the brain and the highest accumulation observed in the thalamus and brainstem. Although the current implementation relies on fluorescent labeling and model NPs, this approach provides a scalable platform for whole-organ biodistribution analysis and lays the foundation for mechanistic studies of barrier permeability, developmental vulnerability, and organ-specific interactions.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

However, some cyanobacteria strains can reversibly remodel their photosynthetic apparatus in order to rely exclusively on far-red photons. This acclimation, known as FaRLiP, requires the synthesis of red-shifted pigments, chlorophyll d, chlorophyll f and far-red allophycocyanin, that are incorporated in paralog subunits of the main photosynthetic complexes, namely photosystem II and photosystem I as well as phycobilisomes. In addition, some far-red-acclimating strains were also observed to show a rise in the carotenoid content and in the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of UV-shielding molecules, suggesting a counterintuitive photoprotective response concomitant with acclimation to lower energy wavelengths. In this work we investigated the response of Chroococcidiopsis thermalis to far-red light, and identified a robust set of photoprotective mechanisms associated with acclimation. Enhanced carotenoid/chlorophyll content ratios correlated with stronger carotenoid-chlorophyll triplet quenching, particularly pronounced for red-shifted chlorophylls. Non-photochemical quenching was higher and activated more rapidly than in cells grown under simulated solar light, and this was accompanied by enhanced antioxidant activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that the far-red acclimated cells, whose photosynthetic apparatus is not optimal under visible light, exhibit a strong photoprotected state, that we propose to be crucial under fluctuating irradiance conditions and during transitions from shaded to non-shaded environments.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

This study analyzed 53 CCCH genes in pearl millet, examining their phylogeny, structure, chromosomal localization, and promoter cis-elements. Expression profiling revealed seven CCCH genes responsive to multiple stresses. Functional characterization of PgC3H50 showed that its overexpression in Arabidopsis conferred enhanced tolerance to drought and salt, evidenced by improved physiological parameters and upregulation of stress-responsive genes. We discovered that the ABA-responsive transcription factor PgAREB1(ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN 1) directly binds to ABRE cis-elements in the PgC3H50 promoter and activates its transcription, validated by yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase, and EMSA assays.

Whether CSF clearance is regulated across the 24-hour day is unknown. Using a quantitative, in vivo assay in zebrafish, we show that the capacity of muLECs to remove macromolecules is highest during the waking day. The muLEC protein uptake is regulated by a cell-autonomous circadian oscillator that drives rhythmic protein levels of Mannose Receptor 1a (Mrc1a); in contrast, lipoprotein uptake increases as a function of time spent awake. Thus, circadian and brain state cues independently maximize muLEC function during wake. Consistently, muLECs are required for normal recovery after the heightened metabolic demand of a seizure, suggesting that muLEC clearance contributes to both normal and disrupted brain homeostasis.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Dysregulation of the Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)/p35 signaling pathway has been implicated in ADHD pathophysiology due to its impact on neuronal connectivity and dopamine regulation. Using p35 knockout (p35KO) mice, a validated model exhibiting ADHD-like phenotypes, we investigated sex-specific WM performance, neuronal activation patterns, and responses to acute treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) or fluoxetine (FLX), administered alone or in combination. Under basal conditions, p35KO mice of both sexes exhibited significant WM impairment in the Y-maze test compared with wild type (WT) counterparts, whereas recognition memory remained intact. Analysis of neuronal activation (c-Fos-IR) 90 minutes after testing revealed region- and sex-dependent alterations. p35KO males showed significantly reduced c-Fos-IR expression in prefrontal cortical regions, while both sexes exhibited increased c-Fos-IR in hippocampal regions. Acute MPH or FLX treatment significantly improved WM in p35KO males, but this benefit was lost with the combined treatment (MPH+FLX). In contrast, p35KO females showed no WM improvement with any treatment. Notably, WT females exhibited a pronounced decline in WM after exposure to MPH, FLX, or their combination, indicating sex-specific pharmacological sensitivity in healthy animals. These findings highlight the critical role of Cdk5/p35 signaling in maintaining the functional balance between prefrontal and hippocampal networks.

Our results indicate that dopamine suppressed GABAergic local neuron activity during odor stimulation. Releasing the antennal lobe network from inhibition increased the principal neural activity for all odorants and led to nonspecific increases in a behavioral appetitive response. Octopamine, on the other hand, did not alter the GABAergic inhibition in the antennal lobe but still reduced the odor-evoked principal neural activity and the behavioral responses elicited by all odorants. Thus, both dopamine and octopamine used distinct mechanisms (altering recurrent inhibition vs intrinsic excitability) to mediate opponent changes in odor-evoked neural activity and behavioral outcomes.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

In real life, sensory inputs are often noisy and change incessantly, raising the question of when and how accurate decisions are made. Cognitive flexibility allows us to revise the choices in case of perceptual conflicts, leading to response revisions. This involves switching between available choices or rapidly stopping misconstrued responses. Here, we quantified these erroneous behavioral actions and studied the underlying neural mechanisms. Mice were trained on an olfactory decision-making task wherein they had to distinguish between a rewarded and an unrewarded stimulus by responding with a lick or withholding it. While the animals respond by licking for both rewarded and unrewarded odor stimuli at the initial stages of learning, the responses almost disappear for the unrewarded ones in the learned stage. However, animals tend to initiate lick responses and stop within a few milliseconds for a few unrewarded trials, even when accuracy levels are high. We describe this phenomenon as decision revisions (DR), and observed it in 5-25% of trials among high-performance blocks. These revisions were mostly observed within a few hundred milliseconds of stimulation. We observed a significantly higher number of revision trials for binary odor mixture discriminations compared to monomolecular ones. Further, by enhancing inhibitory synaptic signaling in the olfactory bulb through photoactivation of ChR2-expressing GAD65-positive GABAergic interneurons, we observed faster odor discrimination and fewer revision trials.

Twenty-six participants encountered a robot across repeated trials. We measured subjective valence, arousal, and trust, along with skin conductance responses. Predictability dominated the results. Consistent robot behavior led to increased trust and positive feelings over time. Conversely, unpredictable behavior kept trust low. Smoothness acted mainly as a moderator for arousal; smooth paths reduced the stress caused by unpredictable moves. We also found that prolonged proximity in gradual movements raised physiological arousal, even if users reported feeling calm.

We induced cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. VPA (300 mg/kg, subcutaneously) was administered within 3 hours after reperfusion and continued for 7 days, followed by CIMT for another week (6 hours/day). The study revealed a significant increase in total infarction volume in the stroke rats compared to controls on day 7 post-stroke.

VPA treatment reduced plasma corticosterone levels and modulated heart rate variability indices in stroke rats, suggesting involvement of neuroendocrine stress responses in post stroke recovery. The electrophysiological findings reveal improved functional connectivity between the penumbral (left) motor cortex and the uninjured motor cortex following combinational treatment. The present study also examined the effects of chronic CIMT and VPA monotherapies and delayed onset CIMT (one week after stroke) on functional recovery following stroke; however, these approaches showed limited efficacy.

T cells recognize peptides presented by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules. It is commonly believed that matching HLA alleles between donors and recipients ensures similarity in their T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, thereby reducing the risk of GVHD and graft rejection. However, TCR repertoires are shaped by multiple factors beyond HLA genetics, including sex, age, and immune history. The extent to which genetic variation and past infections influence TCR repertoire composition and GVHD risk remains unclear. Here, we show that while HLA haplotypes contribute to broad TCR repertoire differences, recent viral infections significantly impact TCR composition and influence GVHD risk. Analyzing 401 patients who were uniformly transplanted from healthy HLA-identical sibling HCT donors, we introduced HLA-TCR coherence, a metric that quantifies the extent to which an individual's TCR repertoire reflects their HLA haplotype. We find that higher TCR-HLA coherence is associated with greater HLA heterozygosity and an increased incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade 3-4) in transplant recipients. Furthermore, in silico identification of virus-associated TCRs (vaTCRs) using TCR sequencing and viral serology reveal specific vaTCRs predictive of either increased or decreased GVHD risk. These findings suggest that beyond HLA allele matching, donor-specific immune history and repertoire characteristics are critical determinants of GVHD risk.

To elucidate this relationship, we integrated B-cell receptor sequencing with plasma IgG immunoproteomics to identify and quantify the recall response (plasma IgG and MBC) to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in eight adults, 24-55 years after their childhood immunization. IPV immunization elicited highly skewed plasma IgG recall repertoires, dominated by a small subset (~8%) of total antibody lineages that were detectable prior to boosting (i.e., \"pre-existing\"). These IgG lineages spiked logarithmically in abundance (~102-104 fold-increase) and potently cross-neutralized multiple PV serotypes in vitro (titers [&ge;] 1:105). Notably, these dominant plasma IgG lineages were clonally linked to class-switched MBCs that circulated in blood 21 days post-boost and bore heavily mutated VH and VL variable region genes. Importantly, IPV-primed ex vivo B-cell cultures (MIMIC, Modular IMmune In vitro Construct) yielded clonal expansions that mirrored the dominant post-boost plasma IgG lineages in vivo, providing an in vitro mechanistic correlate of recall immunity. Together these findings demonstrate a decades-long interconnectivity between persistent MBC clones and the serological IgG repertoire. They further highlight the central role of immunological imprinting, whereby cross-reactive MBC clones--originally primed in childhood--can be reactivated to dominate the circulating IgG recall response more than 50 years after initial exposure.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

We determined a high-resolution crystal structure of human CD1d bound to alpha-galactosylceramide (a-GalCer) at 1.76 A, enabling detailed investigation of ligand-sensitive conformational flexibility at Phe84, a conserved aromatic residue that caps the F groove. Electron density at Phe84 revealed multiple side-chain conformations, suggestive of ligand-induced plasticity. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the canonical rotamer is energetically favoured in the absence of a stabilising groove-occupying ligand. To assess conservation of this putative gating mechanism, we solved the first CD1d structure from a non-human primate, rhesus macaque CD1d-a-GalCer, at 1.83 A resolution. In contrast to the human complex, Phe84 in macaque CD1d adopted a fixed conformation. As this aromatic residue is conserved across CD1 isoforms and CD1d-expressing species, and mirrors gating residues in MHC class I that regulate peptide accommodation, our findings support a shared evolutionary strategy for managing antigen diversity.

Despite this recognition, the long-term and even lifelong consequences of viral infections remain poorly understood. In this study, we infected juvenile mice with influenza viruses and systematically examined the lifelong effects (from 4 to 450 days post-infection) of these infections. Pathological analysis revealed persistent lifelong damage in multiple organs, including chronic lung inflammation and fibrosis, along with significant cardiac and renal pathology. Viral infection led to substantial neuronal loss in key brain regions of mice (hippocampal CA1, CA3, and striatum) during middle and old age. Strikingly, we identified two hallmark pathological features of Parkinson's disease - dopaminergic neuron degeneration and Lewy body-like -synuclein inclusions - in middle and aged infected mice. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated sustained upregulation of inflammation-related genes in both lung and blood tissues, correlating with observed pathological changes. Lung-derived secreted proteins, encoded by differentially expressed genes, may mediate cross-organ communication affecting cardiac, renal, and neurological function. Brain transcriptome analysis at three months post-infection revealed downregulation of neurodevelopmental genes, potentially contributing to subsequent neuronal loss and Parkinsonian pathology. These findings collectively suggest that pulmonary influenza infection can induce systemic multi-organ effects through both secretory pathways and chronic inflammatory responses.

Previously, one study showed that TMC5 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), but its mechanism in LUAD remained unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of TMC5 and its underlying mechanisms in LUAD progression. Methods: The expression level of TMC5 in LUAD tissues was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. TMC5 was knocked down in A549 and H1437 cell lines using lentiviral transfection. The oncogenic effect of TMC5 on LUAD cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay. Transwell assay was employed to assess migration and invasion. Results: TMC5 was overexpressed in LUAD tissues compared with normal tissues. Suppression of TMC5 expression reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion, while also decreasing the expression of mesenchymal markers and increasing epithelial markers in A549 and H1437 cells. Conversely, higher TMC5 expression significantly increased the expression of mesenchymal markers and decreased epithelial markers.

Five missense variants were identified in 5 unrelated CHD probands with distinct phenotypes. Three novel missense (p.D85V, p.R175W, and p.A283T) variants in the pro-peptide region and two other variants (p.M315I and p.N321S) in the mature domain were documented.

Western blot analysis demonstrated enhanced phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 associated with these variants. Furthermore, transactivation assays showed increased activity of BMP-responsive promoters- Id1-luc, Id3-luc, Tlx2-luc, and p(SBE)4-luc with a synergistic effect observed upon AKL2 co-expression. Additionally, overexpression of downstream targets, namely Bmp2, Bmp7, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Irx4, Smad1, Smad4, and Smad5, alongside downregulation of left-right patterning genes (Nodal and Pitx2) and the BMP antagonist Chordin, was observed. Likewise, EdU staining revealed increased cellular proliferation associated with all these variants. Moreover, modeling of secondary and tertiary structures also suggested that these variants might induce conformational changes in BMP7, potentially strengthening its binding affinity with the receptor and thereby amplifying SMAD signaling.

The brain is a high impact organ in aging and age-related disease research, so it was of interest to investigate the viability and related molecular and cellular characteristics of brain slice cultures (BSCs) derived from old mice. Coronal sections of 200 m thickness were collected from the middle third of the brain of 21 month old C57BL/6JN mice, cultured in a standard media concoction for seven days, exposed to chemical stressors glucose, hydrogen peroxide, lipopolysaccharide, or sodium hypochlorite for 24 to 48 hours, and then rinsed and cultured for another seven days. Results in non-treated BSCs showed cellular viability of greater than 80 percent with specific aging pathways relatively unaffected. Chemical stressors selectively targeted pathways of aging including DNA damage, autophagy, and inflammation.

Here we introduce a knockout village framework that enables longitudinal scRNA-seq profiling of 79 human pluripotent stem cell mutant lines targeting 30 developmental regulators, including 15 diabetes genes, across five islet differentiation stages. We show that loss of lineage regulators impairs {beta} cell formation in a stage-specific manner and rewires developmental trajectories towards competing lineages. Notably, several monogenic diabetes gene mutations drive a shift from {beta} cells to enterochromaffin (EC)-like cells, a recently recognized non-canonical islet cell fate. These EC-like cells exhibit incomplete activation of hormone regulation programs, along with elevated neuron signatures. Leveraging the diversity of cell fate outcomes across mutants, we predicted and experimentally validated ISL1 as a key downstream effector of PDX1 and PAX6 that safeguards {beta} cell identity against an EC-like fate.

MITF is well known is for its role in the specification of melanoblasts from the neural crest (NC) and their differentiation into melanocytes, yet little is known about how this activity shapes the stem cell lineages. Here, we use live imaging coupled with single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing to show that MITF (mitfa in zebrafish) protects the melanocyte stem cell (McSC) fate in zebrafish. Utilizing a temperature sensitive mitfavc7 mutant, we show loss of Mitfa leads to a surprising premature and aberrant expansion of McSC progeny at the niche during embryogenesis, coupled with novel emergent transcriptional cell states. Linage tracing of McSCs from the embryonic to juvenile stages reveals Mitfa activity is subsequently required in regeneration by Schwann cell-like and melanocyte stem cell progenitors that serve as a reservoir for fast-responding pigment progenitors. Thus, the impact of Mitfa loss on the melanocyte lineage is cell-state and stage-specific.

While the ecological dynamics of facilitation are increasingly understood, studies evaluating the importance of nurse plants in preserving phylogenetic diversity and protecting species of medicinal value and conservation concern are still limited. Here, we investigated the nurse effects of a Himalayan endemic shrub, Berberis angulosa, in promoting taxonomic richness, composition and phylogenetic diversity of overall and highly valued species in the high-elevation mountain landscape of Langtang National Park, Nepal. Using pair-wise sampling design, we recorded plant communities within the patches of Berberis shrubs and in open gaps at three altitudinal belts. Compared to adjacent open areas, Berberis patches were found to harbor compositionally distinct and phylogenetically diverse plant communities with significantly higher average overall and human-valued species richness. Relative interaction indices showed clear patterns along elevation gradient with the strongest facilitation observed at highest elevation. Similarly, Net Relatedness Indices (NRI) were significantly different between nursed vs open habitats for both overall and human-valued species, with lower mean NRI within Berberis patches indicating higher phylogenetic diversity of communities within the nursed habitats. Facilitation by Berberis enhanced community-level richness by 40% (39 species; total = 97), including 19 human-valued species (~36%; total = 53) that occurred exclusively within shrub canopies. Many medicinal, endemic and conservation priority species were either shrub specialists or had significant association with Berberis patches, illustrating the protective role of the nurse shrub. Our results demonstrate that the facilitative effect of Berberis is not only crucial in maintaining plant communities with diverse evolutionary histories but also equally contributing to local beta and landscape-scale gamma biodiversity, sustaining valuable ecosystem services and benefits to human communities in the Himalayas.

Although ubiquitous, this evolutionarily variable feature has enabled arthropods to occupy diverse lifestyles and ecological niches, contributing to their unrivalled diversity. Because the chitinous cuticle is rigid, exoskeletons must be periodically shed and replaced as animals grow. Arthropods therefore develop through discrete moults, with conserved phases that progress from pre-moult preparation to ecdysis and post-moult maturation. These are tightly regulated developmental transitions controlled by a molecular toolkit comprising neuropeptides, hormone-synthesising enzymes, receptors, and the early, fate, and late gene sets that activate and execute the moulting process. Although genetic studies in model species have identified many components, major knowledge gaps remain, especially in non-insect arthropods. Advances in genome sequencing now enable comparative genomic analyses across diverse, previously understudied arthropod lineages to begin to address these gaps. We present a comprehensive comparative genomic survey of arthropods, sampling all four major subphyla: Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Crustacea, and Hexapoda. Orthology inference and copy-number analyses contrast stable and dynamic components of the moulting machinery across the phylum. Ancestral state reconstructions and phylogenetic reconciliations reveal gene duplication and loss dynamics and the evolutionary histories of key moulting gene families.

Using curated immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptides from IEDB and GBM datasets, TEIP employs dual bidirectional LSTM encoders to represent peptide and HLA sequences, concatenated with auxiliary molecular features including proteasomal cleavage, TAP transport likelihood, gene expression, and mutation frequency. These features are fused into a probabilistic model that outputs peptide-specific immunogenicity scores and confidence estimates. Benchmark results across multiple HLA alleles demonstrate that TEIP outperforms NetMHCpan and MARIA, achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.89 and PR-AUC of 0.35. Feature importance analysis confirms that tumor-specific expression and peptide-MHC binding dominate predictive accuracy, validating the biological realism of the model. By combining mechanistic features with data-driven representation learning, TEIP enables fine-grained prioritization of neoantigens with translational potential. In proof-of-concept GBM studies, TEIP recovered known cancer-testis antigens such as OIP5, demonstrating its ability to identify clinically relevant vaccine targets.

Pathological annotations of TBI regions were obtained from haematoxylin and eosin-stained microscopy images of the same sections. The microscopy images were then registered with the MSI datasets to enable precise delineation of TBI areas within the MSI data. Binary masks of the registered TBI regions were then used to perform cosine similarity searches, identifying ions potentially associated with TBI pathology. In order to relatively quantify the difference magnitude between TBI regions and surrounding tissue, bootstrap sampling was applied to non-TBI tissue areas, generating mean intensity values for comparison with average TBI region intensities. Additionally, a synthetic MSI dataset was generated to validate and optimise this analytical approach.

M.; Zheng, L.; Shen, B.; Li, M.", "abstract": "Maintaining sustained deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools is essential for DNA replication fidelity and genome stability. In EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), we find that disruption of dNTP homeostasis plays a critical role in determining sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib and in shaping mechanisms of acquired resistance. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses revealed that osimertinib suppresses RRM2 expression, a key regulator of dNTP synthesis, through the downregulation of the transcription factor MYBL2. In response to osimertinib-mediated replication stress and dNTP depletion, cells activated a compensatory pathway involving the stress-inducible ribonucleotide reductase subunit RRM2B via a novel transcriptional regulator, TNNT3. We further identified CHK2 signaling as essential for TNNT3 nuclear translocation and RRM2B transcriptional activation. Inhibition of CHK2 or combined CHK1/2 blockade impaired RRM2B induction, exacerbated replication stress, and delayed the development of osimertinib resistance both in vitro and in xenograft models. Collectively, our findings reveal that EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells rely on a dynamic EGFR-MYBL2-RRM2 and CHK2-TNNT3-RRM2B regulatory axis to maintain dNTP pool balance under therapeutic pressure. Disruption of this axis sensitizes tumors to osimertinib and impairs the acquisition of resistance, highlighting dNTP metabolism as a critical vulnerability and actionable target in EGFR-driven lung cancer.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Menopause-related estrogen deficiency exacerbates these disturbances, increasing susceptibility to metabolic syndrome and renal injury. This study investigated whether dietary supplementation with soy isoflavones attenuates obesity-associated kidney injury in ovariectomized rats exposed to a high-fat, high-caloric diet. Female Wistar rats underwent bilateral ovariectomy and were assigned to control diet, hipercaloric diet (DH), or DH supplemented with isoflavones (DH+ISO). Metabolic, biochemical, oxidative stress, histopathological, and inflammatory parameters were evaluated over 120 days. The DH diet induced weight gain, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, impaired renal function, increased oxidative stress, and tubulointerstitial injury, consistent with a CKM phenotype. Isoflavone supplementation did not prevent diet-induced weight gain but attenuated systolic blood pressure elevation and improved lipid and glycemic profiles. Renal function was partially preserved in DH+ISO rats, as evidenced by lower plasma creatinine levels, improved creatinine clearance, reduced urea levels, and decreased urinary peroxide excretion compared with DH animals. Histopathological analysis revealed persistent tubular injury in both DH groups, although inflammatory and oxidative markers were attenuated in isoflavone-treated rats. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated reduced renal IL-6 expression in the DH+ISO group, accompanied by trends toward decreased macrophage infiltration and IL-1{beta} expression. Collectively, these findings indicate that soy isoflavones mitigate metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative pathways implicated in obesity-related kidney injury in a postmenopausal experimental model. Isoflavone supplementation may represent a complementary therapeutic strategy for attenuating CKM-related renal damage associated with modern diets and estrogen deficiency.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Eight participants executed flexion- extension combinations spanning 15 finger actions while we recorded triaxial MMG and bipolar EMG concurrently. MMG supported robust multi-class and finger-specific decoding, recovering a representational geometry that closely matched EMG. Orientation analyses showed that components orthogonal to the muscle axis contributed most significantly to discriminability, providing actionable guidance for OPM array design.

To fill this gap, we investigate here the neuronal mechanisms and mathematical principles of brain spindles by recording and modeling large-scale thalamo-cortical neuronal ensembles in mice under anesthesia. We report irregular weakly synchronized firing of thalamic and cortical neurons associated with spindle patterns, indicating an emergent network rather than cellular dynamics. The consecutive loss of balance between the firing of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons and the increased firing fluctuations, together play in favor of larger spindle amplitude. In addition, the continuous range of spindle frequencies observed reflects a tight equilibrium of interactions between the thalamus and cortex. To create a possible numerical twin of this complex dynamics that could be used during clinical anesthesia, we built a computational model that comprises a reciprocally connected excitatory and inhibitory representation of cortical and thalamic networks driven by random fluctuations. The model parsimoniously explains the changes in spindle dynamics when increasing the anesthesia dose. This model thus links in vivo brain sub-network dynamics with EEG for the readout of anesthetized brain states.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Moreover, although eye-movements are crucial in empathy, it remains unclear how visual attention modulates time perception during empathic experiences. Thus, we employed an empathy-for-pain and duration estimation task, while measuring participants heart rate, skin conductance, and eye-movements, to investigate how empathy and physiological arousal influence time perception. Our findings show that empathy leads to a faster perceived passage of time. Despite increases in physiological arousal during empathy, arousal was not associated with changes in time perception. Instead, greater visual attention to the eyes predicted stronger temporal contraction. Furthermore, trait empathy and autism quotient were related to this effect, whereas alexithymia was not.

Using in vivo calcium imaging, we characterized visual response properties of Satb2-positive RGC axon terminals at two developmental stages. At the early stage, responses segregated into seven functional clusters with diverse tuning profiles. By later stage, these responses reorganized into five clusters, indicating developmental restructuring of functional identities. Longitudinal imaging of individual RGC axons revealed that while some response types remain stable across development, others exhibit pronounced plasticity. In particular, certain RGC cluster acquired additional tuning features and converged into motion-sensitive cluster, coinciding with a marked expansion of motion-responsive cluster and reflecting progressive functional specialization. Visual deprivation experiments revealed that core visual tuning is genetically determined, whereas visual experience is crucial for fine-tuning of the particular functional subtype.

While tuning curves and firing rates offer intuitive insights, theoretical frameworks based on signal-to-noise ratio and decoding efficiency identify Fisher information as the canonical measure of sensitivity, due to its relation with decoding performance. However, this relation holds only under restrictive conditions--when many neurons encode the same stimulus feature or when neural noise is weak. In realistic settings, such as when complex or high-dimensional stimuli are represented by a small ensemble of neurons, Fisher information becomes ill-defined or misleading. To overcome these limitations, we investigate two complementary information-theoretic quantities--the stimulus-specific information (ISSI) and the local information (Iloc)--and propose them as robust alternatives for quantifying sensitivity. We show that ISSI and Iloc converge with Fisher information when signal to noise is large, yet remain meaningful and interpretable beyond that regime. Importantly, these measures capture distinct aspects of sensitivity: ISSI quantifies how observing a response reduces stimulus uncertainty, whereas Iloc reflects how small stimulus perturbations reshape the systems posterior beliefs. Together, they offer a unifying perspective linking information-theoretic and statistical notions of sensitivity, bridging theoretical analysis and experimental investigation of neural coding.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Current vaccine efforts focus on multivalent full length OspA vaccines or tandem arrays of antigenically variable OspA C-terminal fragments. Recent profiling of protective human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), however, suggested the existence of conserved epitopes situated within OspAs central b-sheet (CBS), although direct comparisons of cross-serotype functionality has been hindered by biological differences among the major B. burgdorferi genospecies. To address these issues, we developed a panel of isogenic B. burgdorferi viability reporter strains expressing the seven major OspA serotypes (ST1-7) and probed them with CBS-targeting mAbs to evaluate their complement-dependent borreliacidal activity. The mAbs segregated into three distinct classes with varying degrees of borreliacidal activity: class 1 mAbs exhibited potent killing against all seven OspA serotypes, while classes 2 and 3 had restricted or no activity against two of the seven serotypes. Structural analysis of Fabs derived from each class of mAbs in complex with OspA ST1 showed that they target overlapping epitopes spanning b-strands 6-10 and involve contact with largely invariant residues. Further analysis of B. burgdorferi reporter strains expressing OspA variants from 17 additional B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies identified Lys-107 as a determinant of susceptibility for nearly all CBS mAbs.

CTLs likely also possess a mass killing mechanism that can eliminate target cells more efficiently. Using CAR-T cells against B7H3 present on B16 tumor targets, we demonstrate that activated T cells can also kill targets in a perforin-independent manner by releasing diffusible TNF and IFN{gamma} capable of killing nearby targets in a paracrine fashion even if they bear no antigen. Against an unperturbed target, paracrine killing is inefficient but is enhanced by the deletion of TNFR1 signaling molecules such as TAK1, HOIP, or TBK1/IKK{epsilon}. Notably, these molecules are inhibited naturally by pathogen-encoded antagonists. Expression of a microbial-encoded antagonist, such as the Yersinia-encoded YopJ that antagonizes TAK1 or Ebola-encoded VP35 that antagonizes TBK1/IKK{epsilon}, alters the target cell response to these cytokines from non-lethal to lethal. We propose that target cells are inherently resistant to killing by TNF and IFN{gamma}, but the presence of a microbial factor alters this sensitivity, providing for the selective elimination of the infected cell while minimizing harm to uninfected bystander cells. We propose the term 'pathogen-restriction' to describe this discriminatory mechanism.

In this comprehensive study, we present a two-pronged genetic engineering strategy to overcome these limitations. First, we discovered that overexpression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, such as CD55 and CD59, significantly enhances EV production in HEK293T and Expi293F cells. By engineering a truncated CD55 variant (TR3) that retains the GPI-anchor but lacks functional domains, we developed the ExoBoost cell line, which boosts EVs yield by approximately 50-fold without altering vesicle morphology. Second, we observed acute toxicity in mice following intravenous administration of high-dose ExoBoost EVs, with symptoms resembling venous thromboembolism. Through comparative analysis of EVs derived from other cell types, including keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), we identified Tissue Factor (TF/F3) as the critical causative agent of this lethal response. Moreover, we completely abolished this toxicity by generating a F3-knockout cell line (ExoBoost2.0) using CRISPR/Cas9, thereby raising the safe dose to as high as 1.5E12 particles per mouse, as quantified by nano flow-cytometry (nFCM). Finally, using a novel CD46-nanoluciferase reporter system, we demonstrated that high-dose administration of these safe EVs saturates hepatic and splenic clearance pathways, leading to a dramatic increase of systemic EVs accumulation, particularly in hard-to-target tissues such as the brain (~10,000-fold) and muscle (~1,000-fold).

Comparative profiling revealed locus-dependent configuration, a contraction of ecDNA diversity upon recurrence, and convergent structural architectures across patients, implicating repeat-mediated genomic rearrangements and replication stress in ecDNA biogenesis. These findings elucidate ecDNA-driven mechanisms of tumor adaptation and highlight new molecular vulnerabilities, informing potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for high-grade gliomas.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

It is associated with serious morbidities including anaemia, bladder cancer and infertility. Vector control efforts rely on the use of synthetic molluscicide (Niclosamide) which has been attributed to environmental toxicity. Snail intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis were obtained from water bodies and channels around Zaria, morphologically identified and screened for cercarial shedding. F. exasperata leaves and stem bark were obtained from natural habitat in Zaria, authenticated, dried under shade, ground into powder and subjected to extraction with distilled water, ethanol and methanol. The extracts were evaluated for phytochemical constituents, DPPH and FRAP radical scavenging activities and Molluscicidal efficacy against Bulinus spp. Higher percentage yield (8.62%) was obtained in Methanolic extract. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, cardiac glycosides and steroids. Tannins and Phenolics have higher concentration compared to other phytochemicals detected in all the extracts. In vitro antioxidant analysis demonstrated moderate activity, with DPPH radical scavenging activity of 62%, 60% and 47% for methanolic, aqueous and ethanolic extracts, respectively. Molluscicidal screening of the extracts revealed dose dependent toxicity against Bulinus snails, with LC50 value of 23.59ppm, 28.96ppm, 31.51ppm for ethanolic, methanolic and aqueous extracts, respectively. These findings suggest that F. exasperata stem bark extracts could be exploited for development of eco-friendly botanical molluscicide. Further research is needed to identify the bioactive compounds responsible for Molluscicidal efficacy, elucidate the possible mechanisms of action, evaluate the efficacy in field trials and environmental impact.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Despite being vital for survival, the mechanism of coronary autoregulation is unknown. We hypothesized that GPR39, present in vascular smooth muscle cells, together with its endogenous agonist 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) is responsible for coronary autoregulation. Methods: We created coronary stenoses of varying degrees in open-chest, anesthetized dogs where we measured CBF and CDP. In a subset of animals, coronary venous blood was sampled for eicosanoid, adenosine, endothelin-1, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and prostaglandins levels. Stenoses were recreated during intravenous administration of VC108, a specific GPR39 antagonist and systemic, pulmonary and coronary hemodynamics measured. Results: 15-HETE correlated linearly with CDP over the autoregulatory range (r2=0.47, p=0.0024); none of the other metabolites had any relation with CDP. Prior to administration of VC108, as expected, CBF did not change with CDP in the coronary autoregulatory range. VC108 had no effect of systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics but increased CBF (p=0.02 versus vehicle) by decreasing coronary microvascular resistance (p=0.01 versus vehicle), indicating that GPR39 participates in control of normal coronary vascular tone. With VC108, coronary autoregulation was abolished and CBF became CDP dependent (r2=0.96, p=0.004). Conclusion: GPR39 and its endogenous agonist 15-HETE together orchestrate coronary autoregulation. These novel findings provide a mechanism for coronary autoregulation and could direct pharmacological treatment of various coronary syndromes in humans.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Stn7-mediated phosphorylation of the N-terminus of the light-harvesting complex II protein Lhcb2 plays a central role in photosynthetic state transitions. However, it remains unclear how the intrinsic charge of this region, independent of its phosphorylation status, influences state transitions and thylakoid membrane organization. Here, we introduced specific charge-altering mutations in the Lhcb2 N-terminus of Arabidopsis thaliana in the lhcb2 knock-out background and analyzed their effects on LHCII phosphorylation, state transition dynamics, PSI-LHCII complex formation, and thylakoid ultrastructure. Substitution of a conserved positively charged arginine with a negatively charged glutamate (R2E) markedly reduced Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 phosphorylation and state transition efficiency, and abolished PSI-LHCII complex formation. In contrast, introducing a negative charge at a downstream position (Q9E) had no detectable effects. Electron microscopy revealed no significant changes in thylakoid organization in either mutant compared to WT Lhcb2 plants. Despite strongly reduced Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 phosphorylation in the R2E mutant, residual state transitions persisted, potentially mediated by Stn7-dependent phosphorylation of other target proteins. Together, these results provide insight into the role of N-terminal LHCII electrostatics in state transitions and thylakoid membrane organization in plants.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Root hair development is affected by developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues, primarily Auxin. Auxin is synthesized in shoot and root apical transporters. Here, we report that mutants of the Arabidopsis PLANT U-BOX41 (AtPUB41) gene encoding a ubiquitin ligase (E3) develop fewer and shorter root hairs than wild-type (WT) plants. pub41 mutants are not impaired in sensing and responding to exogenous auxin, suggesting that the root hair phenotype may result from a change in auxin levels and/or distribution. Indeed, Auxin enhances the steady-state levels of PUB41 transcript and protein in the roots. A catalytically inactive decoy protein lacking the U-box, PUB41({Delta}U), complements the sparse root hair phenotype of pub41 mutants to the same extent as full-length PUB41. Plants expressing PUB41({Delta}U) are hyperresponsive to auxin-induced root hair development and PUB41({Delta}U) accumulates in the root elongation and differentiation zones, preferentially in trichoblast cells and their root hairs. Furthermore, in these cells, PUB41-eGFP and PUB41({Delta}U)-eGFP are primarily located on the anticlinal faces, as is the auxin PIN2 exporter. We show colocalization of PUB41({Delta}U)-eGFP and PIN2-mCherry, and binding in vitro of PUB41 to the cytoplasmic hydrophilic loop of PIN2.

In this study, we delineate protective mechanisms of Kv1.3 blockade in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology using comprehensive transcriptomics and proteomics profiling of brain, corresponding with neuropathological effects of two translationally relevant Kv1.3 blockers, namely small molecule PAP-1 and peptide ShK-223. Following 3 months of treatment, both molecules reduced Ab plaque burden. Single nuclear RNA seq (snRNA seq) of brain nuclei showed that PAP-1 disproportionately impacted oligodendrocytes and microglia and increased crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes with endothelial cells. In contrast, ShK-223 had pronounced effects on glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes. Both blockers increased expression of myelination genes in oligodendrocytes and synaptic genes in neurons. Neuroprotective effects of PAP-1 were further confirmed by bulk brain transcriptomics and proteomics whereby PAP-1 increased levels of synaptic, cognitive resilience and mitochondrial proteins, while decreasing glial and immune pathways including STAT1/3 phosphorylation. Using proximity labeling and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that Kv1.3 interacts with STAT1/3 in microglia. Using microglial cell lines and primary microglia, we discovered a preferential functional coupling between Kv1.3 and type 2 but not type 1 IFN signaling. Brain-level disease modification by Kv1.3 blockade was reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via reduced levels of neurofilament-light (NEFL) and resilience protein RPH3A, both of which are increased in human AD CSF.

P.", "abstract": "Hidden (semi-) Markov Models (HsMMs) are increasingly being used to segment neurophysiological signals into sequences of latent cognitive processes. The idea: different processes will leave distinct traces in trial-level recordings of (multivariate) neuro-physiological signals. Markov models, equipped with an emission model of these traces and a latent process model describing the progression through the different latent processes involved in a task, can then be used to infer the most likely process for any time-point and trial. However, the currently used HsMMs remain limited in two important ways. First, they cannot account for subject-level heterogeneity in the latent and emission process. Instead, a single group-level model is assumed to explain the entire data. Second, they cannot account for the potentially nonlinear effects of experimental covariates on the latent and emission process. To address these problems, we present a modeling framework in which the HsMM parameters of the emission and latent process are replaced with mixed additive models, including smooth functions of experimental covariates and random effects. We derive all necessary quantities for empirical Bayes and fully Bayesian inference for all parameters and provide a Python implementation of all estimation algorithms. To demonstrate the advantages offered by this framework, we apply such a multi-level model to an existing lexical decision dataset. We show that, even in such a simple task, not all subjects rely on the same processes equally and that at least two semi-Markov states, previously believed to reflect distinct processes, might actually relate to the same cognitive process.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Within the myeloid lineages, granulocytes and monocytes have been considered to originate from granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) or common myeloid progenitor (CMPs). Single-cell sequencing has refined this hematopoietic hierarchy, revealing that neutrophils and basophils diverge early during commitment. Although current hierarchy models propose that neutrophils and monocytes arise from common neutrophil-macrophage progenitor (NMP) or GMP, their early differentiation trajectories remain inconsistent, leaving the origin relationship between neutrophils and monocytes unclear. This study aimed to clarify the developmental origin of neutrophils and monocytes during hematopoiesis. Leveraging a previously established single-cell atlas of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), we refined a trilineage hierarchy model, revealing the direct commitment of neutrophils from early multipotent progenitors (MPCs) and their divergence from lymphoid lineages. HOPX was identified as a key regulator during lymphoid lineage commitment. Using HOPX-based lineage tracing, we reconstructed the differentiation trajectory of neutrophils and monocytes. Lineage-tracing results revealed that HOPX-derived tdTomato positive cells contribute extensively to lymphoid lineages and monocytes, but not to neutrophils or erythroid cells. Ex vivo primary macrophage cultures derived from bone marrow cells yielded consistent findings. Our results indicate that monocytes are committed from same precursor with lymphoid lineages, and diverge from neutrophils. Moreover, we propose that classical common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), redefined as lymphoid monocyte progenitors (LMPs), rather than GMPs, constitute the likely ancestral source of monocyte lineage. These findings challenge the dogma of hematopoietic hierarchy and open new avenues for understanding lineage specification. Future studies involving conditional knockout of HOPX will provide further mechanistic validation of these conclusions.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

S.; Seshadri, V.; Ratnaparkhi, A.", "abstract": "Asymmetric localization of oskar mRNA to the posterior of the oocyte is a complex process driven by autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms. The former includes Oskar protein that reinforces localization and anchoring of its mRNA through activation of endocytosis and regulation of actin cytoskeleton; the latter includes signals from the posterior follicle cells (PFCs) that regulates microtubule orientation for polarized transport. Here we identify Monensin Sensitivity 1 (Mon1), as a novel factor regulating anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning. Mon1 is an evolutionarily conserved activator of Rab7- a key regulator of the endo-lysosomal pathway. Embryos lacking maternal mon1 (mon1m) show mislocalized oskar and bicoid mRNAs leading to loss of patterning and lethality. In the mutant oocyte Staufen appears clumpy and the levels of Oskar protein and Par-1 are significantly reduced. Abnormal actin rings are seen in the ooplasm. Driving expression of mon1 in the germline rescues these phenotypes and restores viability. In contrast, expression in the PFC predominantly rescues the Par-1 phenotype with a modest effect on viability. We demonstrate that oskar mRNA interacts with Rab7 suggesting possible role for the Mon1-Rab7 axis in the transport of oskar. We show that in the PFCs, mon1 modulates PIP2 levels to regulate accumulation of Par-1 in the oocyte posterior. We propose that Mon1 regulates oskar localization in two distinct ways: cell autonomously in the germline by regulating Rab7, and non-cell autonomously through modulation of PIP2 in the PFCs.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we uncover both cell- and non-cell-autonomous roles for the conserved terminal selector UNC-3 in C. elegans motor neurons (MNs). UNC-3 is an ortholog of human EBF3, mutations in which cause a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cholinergic MNs, which express unc-3, and downstream GABA MNs, which do not, revealed that unc-3 loss disrupts neuronal identity in distinct ways across MN classes. Four cholinergic MN classes lose their molecular identity entirely, whereas the AS class retains it partially, illuminating terminal selector-driven neuronal diversification processes. Integrated transcriptomic and genomic analyses uncovered a dual cell-autonomous role for UNC-3 as both a direct activator and repressor of neuron-type-specific genes in cholinergic MNs, including repression of alternate neurotransmitter programs. Unexpectedly, unc-3 loss also caused widespread transcriptional, morphological, and connectivity defects in downstream GABA MNs. Mechanistically, these non-cell-autonomous effects are mediated by cholinergic neurotransmission and include activation of the pro-regenerative bZIP TF CEBP-1 (C/EBP) and dysregulation of UNC-6/Netrin signaling.

Transcriptionally, high glucose and mannitol elicited overlapping osmoadaptive transcriptional programs indicative of metabolic remodeling, whereas high glucose alone induced mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation downregulation alongside selective activation of bone anabolic and inflammatory pathways. RNA-protein integration revealed moderate coupling at baseline, indicating that mRNA levels capture only part of the proteomic output. High glucose reorganized RNA-protein relationship, sorting genes into four patterns of matched or opposing RNA-protein responses. The four groups were enriched in distinct biological pathways that shaped cellular response to stress exposing significant post-transcriptional and translational control under high glucose levels.

Participants were randomly assigned to an inactivity or multi-modality exercise intervention group for fourteen days of HDBR, followed by seven days of rehabilitation and additional follow-up appointments. Gut (n=343) and oral (n=344) taxonomic profiles were generated using V4/V5 16S rRNA gene sequencing from fecal and salivary samples collected throughout the study. Gut functional profiles were generated using metagenomic (n=86) and metabolomic (n=83) data. Frailty was measured using a 36-item frailty index. Inactivity-associated changes to the gut microbiome during HDBR included decreasing -diversity, decreasing Akkermansia and Lactobacillus, and increasing Bacteroides. Exercise-associated changes included increasing gut Roseburia. Interestingly, oral microbiome {beta}-diversity was more strongly associated with frailty than the gut. We conclude that inactivity-associated changes to the human microbiome could contribute to the early stages of frailty development, and that exercise can serve as an effective countermeasure against these effects.

Objective: We employed a molecular tool to characterize Mtb isolates from predominantly rural patients at two public hospitals in East Gojjam, Amhara Region, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: Molecular typing, including the region of difference 9 (RD9)-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and spoligotyping, was performed on stored sputum samples at Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI) in Addis Ababa. Results: Out of 120 Mtb, 116 yielded interpretable spoligotyping results, revealing four major lineages. The Euro-American (Lineage 4) was most common (42.6%), followed by the Ethiopian (Lineage 7, 20.8%), Indo-Oceanic (Lineage 1, 20.0%), and East African-Indian (Lineage 3, 16.5%).

Copy number expansion occurs by tandem duplication of MYH3C coding and regulatory regions on the stickleback sex chromosome.

T.; Goodarzi, H.", "abstract": "HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) lacks reliable biomarkers for early detection and molecular stratification. We recently described orphan non-coding RNAs (oncRNAs) as a class of cancer-emergent small RNAs that arise from cryptic promoters largely silent in normal tissues. Here, we define the comprehensive landscape of oncRNAs in HNSCC. Using TCGA and CPTAC-3 data, we demonstrate that these transcripts are not only tumor-specific but provide digital fingerprints that accurately stratify tumors by anatomical site. Moving from association to function, we investigated whether these emergent transcripts actively drive tumorigenesis. We focused on oncRNA64585, a transcript highly enriched in oral cavity tumors and associated with tumor progression. Its depletion significantly impaired proliferation in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in syngeneic murine models. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling revealed that oncRNA64585 regulates transcriptional programs governing cell cycle progression and apoptosis through interaction with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Finally, we demonstrate the clinical utility of these signatures: oncRNA profiles in plasma predicted oral cavity cancer with >90% accuracy up to four years prior to clinical diagnosis. These findings establish oncRNAs as active drivers of HNSCC biology and potent tools for early detection and therapeutic targeting.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

H.; An, H. J.; Durr, K.; An, K.; Kim, J. H.; Lee, D.-H.; Koo, B.-K.; Yun, J.-H.; Lee, H.-S.", "abstract": "Plant receptor kinases perceive diverse peptide signals to coordinate stress responses and developmental programs. The HAESA-LIKE 3 (HSL3/NUT) receptor recognizes CTNIP/SCREW phytocytokines--disulfide-stabilized cyclic peptides that regulate immune signaling and stress adaptation. However, how HSL3 distinguishes these structurally constrained cyclic peptides from linear signaling molecules remains unknown. Here we report near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of HSL3 in apo and CTNIP448-70-bound states at ~2.6 [A], using Arabidopsis CTNIP4 as a representative family member, revealing distinct mechanisms for cyclic peptide recognition. The conserved CTNIP motif occupies a negatively charged pocket in HSL3's C-terminal region through a combination of polar contacts, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals interactions. The receptor employs a two-step recognition mechanism--electrostatic steering followed by motif anchoring--that enables rapid ligand capture and release, consistent with the transient nature of stress signaling. Notably, an N-glycan at Asn449 directly contacts the CTNIP4 peptide, establishing glycosylation as an active participant in ligand recognition. Structure-guided mutagenesis combined with reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst assays confirmed the functional importance of key binding interfaces. N-terminal truncation experiments revealed a minimal active fragment: CTNIP451-70 supported both rapid ROS production and sustained seedling growth inhibition, whereas the shorter CTNIP454-70 variant retained ROS activity but failed to trigger long-term seedling growth inhibition. Structure-guided coevolutionary analysis across plant lineages reveals patterns of both conserved and variable receptor-ligand interfaces, highlighting evolutionary flexibility while preserving core features of recognition. These conserved recognition principles, mediated by receptor glycosylation and evolutionary plasticity, enable specificity in peptide signaling with implications for engineering stress-resilient crops.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}

Recent foundation models, such as Boltz-2, have achieved remarkable accuracy, but their high computational cost poses a major barrier to large-scale virtual screening. We address this challenge by introducing a lightweight structure based virtual screening model, FlashAffinity, that achieves similar performance as Boltz-2 in affinity prediction and binder classification tasks, while achieving a 50x speedup at inference time. FlashAffinity replaces the expensive protein structure prediction models with a simple protein-ligand docking model and the PairFormer-based affinity scoring module with a cheap EGNN architecture. In summary, this work bridges the gap between accuracy and efficiency, enabling ultra-fast virtual screening of massive chemical libraries.", "date": "2025-12-25", "journal": ""}
