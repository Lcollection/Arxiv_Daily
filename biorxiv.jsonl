In the intestine, recent studies have shown that fibroblast migration contributes to tissue morphogenesis and wound healing. Yet, whether physical interactions between epithelial cells and fibroblasts contribute to epithelial movement remains elusive. Here, we show that subepithelial fibroblast alignment enhances directed and persistent migration of organoid-derived intestinal epithelia. Using a reconstituted epithelial-stromal gap-closure model, we demonstrate that direct contact with fibroblasts improves gap closure by promoting cell alignment, sustaining tissue integrity, and synchronizing crypt-villus migration. Fibroblasts undergo long-range ordering to align perpendicularly to the epithelial front and deposit protein paths that act as guidance features to direct epithelial migration. In parallel, epithelial cells acquire a wound-associated epithelial-like phenotype, but insufficient to explain the effects of fibroblast contact. Our findings uncover a dual role for intestinal fibroblasts in epithelial repair, coordinating both biochemical and physical cues to ensure efficient and cohesive migration.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

The network is required to have surface spin-half particles. We show that the signals thus generated carry information regarding their creation and can transfer and store this information to form memory structures in helical aligned surface spin-half particles present on the surfaces of the pathways traversed by the signals. Theoretical neuroscience is progressing strongly with novel representations of the brain, enhanced by the increase of computational power now available. New methods to explore complex brain events and the structures for storing memories as engrams are emerging. However, there are major conceptual theoretical problems that remain unaddressed. Current theoretical methods are very capable of reacting to experimental results and modelling both neural signalling and structure. Yet they still fall short to throw light on how the brain creates its own information code, or relate the variety of brain signals observed, or explain where and how memories are stored. We prove that current brain signals cannot carry information regarding their formation so that they cannot be used to understand how memories of events are related to signals. Thus our results address these basic unresolved theoretical problems of neuroscience and suggest testable solutions. The memory structures of aligned spin-half particles suggested have not been observed in biological organisms as yet they but they have been observed in solid state physics and their existence is consistent with conventional understandings of neurobiology. All the results stated follow from the dynamical law for the network.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is required to treat such a condition but it is associated with a small increase in birth defects in comparison to pregnancies not involving assisted conception . Consequently, new targeted treatments are needed to restore fertility. Here, a combination of in vivo injection and electroporation of capped and poly-A-tailed naked mRNA is tested as a strategy to treat ARMC2-related infertility in mouse. mRNAs coding for several reporter genes are tested and the efficiency and the kinetic of expression are assessed using in vivo and in vitro 2D and 3D imaging experiments. We show that mRNA-coded reporter proteins are detected for up to 3 weeks in germ cells, making the use of mRNA possible to treat infertility. We compare these results with those obtained with a non-integrative plasmid Enhanced Episomal Vector (EEV), which induces low and transient expression in spermatogenic cells. Consequently, injection and electroporation of naked mRNA-Armc2 into the testes of Armc2-deficient males were performed and we show the presence of normal and motile sperm in the epididymis.

To improve the speed of volumetric imaging in Drosophila, we leverage the recently introduced light beads microscopy (LBM) method. We built a microscope and a LBM module tailored to fly brain experiments and used it to record brain-wide calcium signals in adult behaving flies at 28 volumes per second and at 60 volumes per second when selecting the central brain alone. We uncover fast-timescale auditory responses that are missed with standard volumetric imaging. We also demonstrate how temporal super-resolution can be combined with LBM data to uncover responses to single Drosophila courtship song pulses.

These adaptations can include biofilm formation, where the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances can protect the cells from a hostile environment, or, under nutrient-limited conditions, pseudohyphal or hyphal growth, where the colony can send out long 'tendrils' to explore the environment and seek nutrients. Recently, we observed a spiral colony morphology emerge in an isolate of the hyphae-forming yeast Magnusiomyces magnusii grown under laboratory conditions. We use an off-lattice agent-based model (ABM) that simulates colony development to investigate the hypothesis that the spiral morphology is the result of bias in the angle between successive hyphal segments. The model involves biologically-motivated rules of hyphal extension, with key model parameters including the colony size at the onset of hyphal filaments, and the angle between the penultimate and the apical segments. Using one example of an experimentally-grown colony, we use a sequential neural likelihood method to perform likelihood-free Bayesian inference to infer the model parameters. Our results indicate a mean angle between hyphal segments of 2.3 degrees [1.1, 3.6] (95% credible interval).

Because protein folds are more conserved and functionally informative than sequences alone, structural information offers a powerful lens for analysis. Here, we introduce a generative, structure-aware framework that integrates geometric encoding and coevolutionary constraints to map, cluster, and design protein sequences. Our approach employs the 3D interaction (3Di) alphabet to convert local residue geometries into compact, 20-state discrete representations. Using ProstT5, we enable bidirectional translation between amino acid sequences and 3Di representations, facilitating sensitive homology detection and structure-guided sequence generation. We construct a latent sequence landscape by combining 3Di-based alignments with direct coupling analysis (DCA) and variational autoencoders (VAE), unifying tasks such as clustering, annotation, and design. This integrative framework enhances the detection of coevolutionary signals and enables rational sampling of structural variants, even without functional labels. We demonstrate the utility of our method across diverse protein families, including globins, kinases, and malate dehydrogenases, achieving improved contact prediction, homology inference, and sequence generation.

In this study the effect of empagliflozin (EM) on sympatho-excitation and potential neurogenic mechanism for EM`s therapeutic effects on cardiac remodeling were studied. Methods: Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt and high-salt (8%) diet (HSD) mouse models were utilized. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to explore the mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardiac remodeling in hypertension. Meanwhile, blood samples were collected from hospitalized patients diagnosed with heart failure to verify the results of animal studies. Results: In DOCA-salt or HSD treated mice, EM was associated with a protective, blood pressure-independent effect on cardiac remodeling. Both DOCA-salt and HSD induced sympatho-excitation, together with neuronal hyper-activity in the pre-autonomic regions of brain, and these were blunted in mice with EM co-treatment. Additionally, single-nucleus RNA sequencing using hypothalami indicated that cellular interplays among the vessels, microglia and inhibitory neurons were involved in the disease- and EM-associated actions. Further analysis of microglia pinpointed a close involvement of peripheral immune activation in disease-associated state transformation of microglia, during DOCA-salt or HSD treatment, including increased lymphocytes count and plasma level of interferon-{gamma}. Differentially expressed genes in neurons highlighted that EM abolished disease-associated upregulation of protein ubiquitination, which might support imbalance of presympathetic excitatory/inhibitory tones, and vasopressin production. In patients` blood samples, EM was associated with significant elevation of hematocrit value in all groups, and reduction of lymphocytes counts in the patients with high NT-proBNP value (> 2550 pg/mL, no diuretic co-treatment).

What evolutionary pressures shape this diversity? Given the role of the hippocampus in spatial mapping, the greater spatial navigation demands of larger home ranges may drive selection for more hippocampal neuron. Using data from 342 species, we crossed home range and population density data with cortical and hippocampal neuron counts predicted from clade-specific brain scaling laws to examine whether home range scales universally with estimated hippocampal neuron numbers across mammals. We confirm that home range scales universally with the inverse of population density across species and increases with body mass and metabolic rate. However, home range does not scale universally with hippocampal or cortical neuron numbers. Rather, scaling relationships differ by clade, such that carnivorans and cetartiodactyls traverse home ranges over 1,000-fold larger than primates with equivalent hippocampal neuron numbers. These findings persist across data subsets controlling for study method, duration, and temporal scope. Numbers of hippocampal neurons are thus not limiting to spatial navigation in the wild, calling into question adaptationist explanations for the evolution of more hippocampal neurons based on a supposed need for increased spatial processing capacity. We propose that home range is determined primarily by population density, mediated by field metabolic rate and diet. The diversity in hippocampal neuron numbers across mammals, in turn, arises as a byproduct of clade-specific scaling of numbers of cortical neurons which we suggest is contingent on energetic opportunity, not on navigational or other cognitive demands.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

As neuron arbours can both span large distances, and be densely interwoven, one major challenge is acquiring and quantifying fine structures for independent rbours over large spatial extents. Recent whole-brain Electron Microscopy (EM) connectomes of Drosophila melanogaster provide an ideal opportunity to study fly neuronal morphology at scale. Utilising this rich resource, we developed novel computational methods and morphological metrics to perform the most comprehensive morphological analysis on the dendrites of the famous T4 and T5 neurons in the fly brain. T4 and T5 neurons are the first direction-selective neurons in the visual pathway. They are the most numerous cell types in the fly brain (~6000 within each optic lobe) and as a population, their compact dendritic arbours tile the entire visual field. They are classified into four subtypes (a,b,c, and d). Each subtype encodes one of four orthogonal motion directions (up, down, forwards, backwards). The dendrites of these neurons form in two distinct neuropils, the Medulla (T4) and the Lobula (T5), and respond to ON (light increments) and OFF (light decrements) motions, respectively. T4 and T5 neurons' dendrites are oriented asymmetrically in a direction inverse to the direction of motion which they encode. However, the differences beyond their characteristic orientation, both between T4 and T5, as well as within subtypes, has remained poorly understood. Our analysis reveals a high degree of structural similarity across both types and subtypes. Particularly, the geometry of branching, section orientation, and tree-graph structure of these dendrites shows only minor variability, with no consistent separation between T4 and T5, or their subtypes. These results indicate that, despite forming in different neuropils, and serving distinct motion directions, T4 and T5 dendrites follow closely aligned morphological patterns.

In the case of ants, specifically Camponotus (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) present in Chile, their biogeographic affinity with species from the rest of the world has not been studied, with only suggestions of a possible affinity with the Austral/Oceanic entomofauna. On the other hand, the phylogenetic arrangement among the species of the country is not clear, but the history of taxonomic changes suggests a greater kinship between two groups of species according to their similarity in morphological characteristics: 1) C. chilensis, C. ovaticeps and C. spinolae; 2) C. morosus, C. distinguendus and C. hellmichi. To date, no studies have been conducted to directly verify this proposal or to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among Chilean species. In the present study, we evaluated for the first time the biogeographic affinities and phylogenetic relationships of Camponotus species present in Chile through the estimation of a global and local phylogeny using molecular data, which were generated for the first time for Chilean species and complemented with sequences obtained from BOLD for species from the rest of the world. Additionally, specimens that could not be identified with the available taxonomic keys and whose morphological characters did not fit the existing species diagnoses were included in the study to evaluate their phylogenetic position and the possibility that they correspond to new species. The results indicate a greater affinity of the Chilean species with the Neotropical and Ethiopic fauna, in disagreement with the hypothesis of a possible relationship with the Austral/Oceanic fauna. Second, the relationships among Chilean species did not follow the expected pattern suggested by the taxonomic history of the species. It seems that certain morphological characteristics evolved independently more than once in different clades of the phylogeny. Finally, profound genetic divergences were found, both among known species and with specimens that could not be identified a priori, which in some cases also extended to lineages, presumably of the same species, suggesting substantial cryptic diversity and the possibility of several undescribed species.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

While the role of these genes in the early specification of organ identity is well established, their late function throughout floral organ development and in specific cell types is much less characterized.

In this study, using a combination of single-cell RNA-Seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation on phdef cell layer-specific mutants, we find that PhDEF regulates a different set of target genes in the petal epidermis and mesophyll, with a major regulatory action in the epidermis. We uncover a high diversity of binding profiles in PhDEF target genes, with a complex combination of layer-specific or -aspecific binding sites, and a much more prominent binding of PhDEF in the epidermis than in the mesophyll.

Recently, mosasauroid remains have been discovered in freshwater environments in several continental deposits of the Santonian-Campanian of Europe.

This mosasauroid, approximately 2.5 m long, with terrestrial-like limbs and a sacrum, and with osteosclerosis in its vertebrae and humerus (at least), was probably hovering at shallow depth in freshwater ecosystems. This new discovery raises the fact that, according to current knowledge, it is only within the Tethysaurinae that freshwater forms evolved, pointing to a possible niche partitioning, associated with of the maintain of the plesiopedal / plesiopelvic condition, in parallel with the invasion of open waters by most other hydropedal and hydropelvic mosasauroids.

Exogenous IFN treatment rewires innate responses to drive virus elimination, yet therapeutic trials to date have been unremarkable. Resolving this paradox could translate to variant-agnostic innate immunotherapy. By contrast, oncolytic viruses (OV) exhibit profoundly attenuated innate antagonism, resulting in potent IFN responses despite the inherently immunosuppressive nature of tumour microenvironments. Moreover, OV only undergo lytic replication within innate-deficient malignant cells, and not in cells where sufficient innate responses exist. This, combined with previous studies showing that OV suppressed replication of underlying oncogenic viruses in tumours, we explored whether clinical grade oncolytic Orthoreovirus (Reo) superinfection could eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from immune-competent lung epithelial cell lines in the absence of toxicity. Reo exerted profound activation of innate responses, including when SARS-CoV- 2 infection was already established, rewiring cells towards an antiviral state emulating that of Reo infection alone. Both intracellular and paracrine mechanisms induced ISG repertoires including multiple known anti-SARS-CoV-2 effectors, as well as others that remain unvalidated. Amongst these, we demonstrate the first direct evidence that MX2 and XAF1 restrict SARS- CoV-2 replication.

Although MDSC metabolism has been extensively studied in cancer, the metabolic phenotype of this heterogeneous population in sepsis remains unclear. Our goal was to assess metabolic flux in blood MDSCs during and after sepsis and to stratify patient clinical features and outcome with differences in metabolic flux that may guide treatment decisions. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy subjects and sepsis patients at 4 days, 2-3 weeks, and 6 months underwent CD66b+ or CD3+ enrichment, followed by assessment of metabolic flux, flow cytometry, mRNA sequencing, and chromatin accessibility. Mitochondrial basal oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and maximal oxygen consumption rates (SRC, spare respiratory capacity) were decreased in MDSC from septic patients at 4 days after infection and persisted for up to 6 months after sepsis onset. Sepsis was not associated with differences in glycolysis. In contrast, oxidative metabolism in CD3+ T cells was similar between sepsis patients and healthy subjects. Reduced MDSC oxidative metabolism was linked to adverse clinical outcomes. The decline in oxygen consumption from MDSCs in septic patients was also associated with significant reductions in MDSC mitochondrial content. Transcriptomic analysis of CD66b+ cells isolated from PBMC of healthy participants and patients with sepsis at 4 days, 2-3 weeks, and 6 months revealed 19 differentially expressed genes and three long non-coding RNAs as potentially responsible for this decline in mitochondrial mass. Specifically, NR4A3, NR4A2, and TAMLIN/NR4A1 expression, all critical for mitochondrial biogenesis, were persistently decreased with reduced chromatin accessibility indicative of gene silencing. After sepsis, blood CD66b+ cells present with reduced mitochondrial mass and oxidative metabolism that continue at least 6 months after sepsis. These changes in mitochondrial function result from a reduced content of these organelles. We have also identified gene silencing, reduced gene expression of key transcription factors that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as increased long non-coding RNA as potential drivers of this unique metabolic phenotype.

While the mitochondria in neurites are generally depleted of mtDNA, those at axon branch points preferentially engage in mtDNA replication and transcription, accumulate nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNA, and are spatially linked to nascent cytosolic peptide synthesis. The mtDNA-positive mitochondrial pool exhibits asymmetric genome partitioning at division, shedding highly motile daughters that lack mtDNA. Asymmetric division rejuvenates the membrane potential of the mtDNA-rich, biogenesis-dedicated mitochondria. We also found that, in peripheral sensory neurons, axonal mitochondria rarely fuse or share matrix contents, explaining how differentiated daughters maintain their distinct composition and fate after fission. Thus, division-coupled mitochondrial self-renewal is yoked to neurite topology in sensory neurons, patterning mitochondrial diversity and homeostasis from micron to meter scales.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Mutations that are deleterious in males but neutral or beneficial in females can persist in populations. This predicts that mtDNA-based phenotypic variation should be more common among males than among females, a pattern referred to as Mothers Curse (MC). Most studies of MC place alternative mtDNAs on common homozygous nuclear chromosomal backgrounds, a condition not common in nature. Moreover, it is not known whether MC effects accumulate as mtDNAs acquire nucleotide substitutions between populations or species. We tested the MC hypothesis using mtDNAs from Drosophila melanogaster (OreR, Zimbabwe or w1118), D. simulans (siI and siII) and D. yakuba each placed on several D. melanogaster nuclear backgrounds heterozygous for different chromosomal deficiencies paired with a common w1118 chromosome set. Females and males were tested for starvation resistance, climbing speed, and flight performance. In the majority of chromosomal backgrounds the variance among mtDNA genotypes was greater in females than in males, opposite from the central prediction of Mothers Curse. This suggests that additive and dominance variation across the nuclear genome may provide nuclear blessings that can counter the curse of maternally inherited mtDNA.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

While dietary sources of animal origin (e.g., red meat) contribute to the carnitine pool, de novo carnitine synthesis from trimethyllysine (TML) is essential, particularly for those whose dietary sources are vegetables and fruits that contain negligible amounts of carnitine. However, the molecular pathway of de novo carnitine synthesis and its physiological significance remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that SLC25A45 is a mitochondrial TML carrier that controls de novo carnitine biosynthesis in vivo. Genetic loss of SLC25A45 results in systemic carnitine and acylcarnitine deficiency, leading to impaired fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis during cold adaptation, while promoting glucose catabolism. Notably, Slc25a45-deficient mice maintained a high respiratory exchange ratio and impaired lipid mobilization following treatment with a GLP1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), rendering them resistant to GLP-1RA-induced adipose tissue loss. Together, the present study identifies SLC25A45 as a regulatory checkpoint in fuel switching during adaptation, with implications for systemic energy balance and response to GLP-1RA-mediated anti-obesity therapy.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

In humans, APOE has three isoforms: APOE2 (E2), APOE3 (E3), and APOE4 (E4); E4 increases AD risk, while E3 is neutral and E2 decreases risk. In the brain, APOE is predominantly produced by astrocytes, where it binds lipids to form HDL-like particles, and plays a central role in lipid homeostasis, A{beta} clearance, and neuroimmune modulation. Its lipidation state is critical for function, with E4 being poorly lipidated compared to E2 and E3, contributing to the pathogenic effects of E4 while also offering a potential therapeutic target. We have previously demonstrated that the HDL-mimetic peptide 4F increases APOE secretion and lipidation in wild-type mouse astrocytes and counteracts the inhibitory effects of A{beta}42. Here, we assessed the ability of 4F to mitigate E4-associated dysfunction using primary astrocytes from humanized E3 and E4 knock-in mice and isogenic human iPSC-derived astrocytes and cerebral organoids. Results showed that 4F enhanced APOE secretion and lipidation in both cellular and organoid models in the absence or presence of aggregated A{beta}42. Compared to E3 astrocytes, E4 astrocytes were prone to A{beta}42-induced inhibition of APOE secretion and lipidation and increased accumulation of lipid droplets. 4F treatment ameliorated the inhibitory effects of A{beta}42 and reduced lipid droplet accumulation.

We demonstrate that, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tracts harboring unrepaired lesions rather than DSBs at collapsed replication forks can persist through mitosis. Only during the subsequent S phase, these tracts are converted into a new class of, highly clastogenic, DSBs. Consistent with a role of this mechanism in carcinogenesis, prostate cancers exhibiting extensive genomic rearrangements frequently harbor somatic defects in NER or in error-free homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair.

Here, we studied how repeated social isolation impacts inflammation-related oxylipin profiles in seven different organs and serum of aged mice. Additionally, we explored physical exercise as a tool to ameliorate age- and isolation-associated inflammation. Our results show that social isolation induces significant increases in interleukin-1{beta} levels and stimulates a dramatic production of lipoxygenase (LOX)-derived oxylipins in an organ-dependent manner, particularly pronounced in liver, lung, and spleen. Physical exercise failed to mitigate the pro-inflammatory effects induced by social isolation.

In this study, we investigated how environmental factors, such as substrate availability and pH affect B. infantis DSM20088 growth and ALA production in vitro. Bacterial batch cultivations supplemented with different amino acid concentrations revealed a linear relationship between indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid (OH-PLA), and phenyllactic acid (PLA) production and exogenous concentrations of tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine, respectively. Furthermore, chemostat cultivations at physiological relevant pH levels (4.5, 5.5 and 6.5) showed that an acidic pH slowed growth and shifted ALA production by B. infantis. Overall, ALA concentrations correlated strongly with bacterial abundance across and within pH levels, showing that cell density is a major determinant of ALA production. After considering the growth limiting effects of lower environmental pH, it had limited impact on the total production of ALAs, but the relative production of PLA was stepwise enhanced at more acidic pH at the expense of ILA, independent of cell density.

We found that both F. animalis and F. nucleatum invade cultured human gastric adenocarcinoma cells, but F. animalis exhibited higher adherence and invasion, and hypoxic conditions promoted higher bacterial survival. Both adherence and invasion were inhibited by exogenous GalNAc, a glycan commonly observed in membrane glycoproteins of adenocarcinoma cells, and a target of the fusobacterial adhesin Fap2. Using a mouse model of gastric metaplasia, we found that F. animalis colonized gastric tissue only after metaplasia onset, growing in multispecies biofilms in the mucus layer, while F. nucleatum colonized neither healthy nor metaplastic gastric tissue. Metaplasia led to upregulation of Gal-GalNAc in the stomach, and reduced gastric acidity allowed higher F. animalis loads in this model.

Traditional methods for identifying new phage proteins that inhibit bacterial transcription are labor-intensive and require access to live phages. To overcome these limitations, we developed a highly efficient pipeline for AlphaFold 3-guided discovery of phage proteins that inhibit bacterial transcription.

LC3-asssociated endocytosis (LANDO) is a novel non-canonical function of autophagy proteins, in which LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3) is conjugated to early endosome membranes using a portion of the canonical autophagy machinery, and functions in the endocytic recycling of several plasma membrane proteins. Here we ask whether perturbation of LANDO can promote cardiovascular pathogenesis. Methods: Cardiac and endothelial functions were assessed by echocardiography and flow-mediated dilatation in mice lacking Rubicon (Rubcn-/-) or the WD domain of ATG16L1 (Atg16l1?WDki), two known effectors of LANDO. Mice with conditional depletion of Rubicon in the endothelial, myeloid and cardiomyocyte compartments were used as well. Three-dimensional murine cardiac vasculature leakiness was investigated by light sheet fluorescence microcopy. Endothelial activation induced by shear stress was characterized in vitro in primary endothelial cells isolated from murine lungs and human aortic endothelial cells. Associations between genetically predicted expression of candidate genes involved in LANDO and human cardiovascular parameters were studied in the Young Finns Study and the UK Biobank. Results: Compared to littermate controls, young Rubcn-/- and Atg16l1{Delta}WDki mice showed a decrease in cardiac and endothelial functions, as did mice with endothelium-specific deficiency. VEGFR2 recycling to the plasma membrane and nitric oxide pathway during shear stress were disrupted in LANDO-deficient primary murine and human endothelial cells. Proteomic analysis in primary human aortic endothelial cells revealed an upregulation of intracellular hemoglobin subunit alpha (Hb-) upon shear stress, which was blunted when RUBCN was ablated. Genetic expression studies uncovered several candidate genes related to LANDO that correlated with cardiovascular parameters. These included the retromer complex subunit VPS29, disruption of which decreased Hb- expression levels in human endothelial cells. Conclusions: Our data support a pivotal role of non-canonical functions of autophagy proteins in recycling VEGFR2 upon shear stress activation in endothelial cells together with Hb- expression that may contribute to the etiology of cardiovascular diseases.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Although chirality is simultaneously present at multiple scales for each case, existing chirality measures rely only on singular scale-specific quantifiers, and some of them yield incorrect chirality assignments for biomolecules. Here we introduce the Fourier Helicity Spectra, a mathematical framework to decompose geometry of chemical and biological structures encompassing the scale dependence of mirror asymmetry. Fourier decomposition of 3D objects into helical harmonics enables one to compute a handedness-resolved characteristics of complex shapes, while reducing computational cost. We show its applicability for a diverse range of chemical systems, from biomacromolecular electron densities to tomographic reconstructions of inorganic nanostructures. Furthermore, inverse transform of isolated spectral components into real space enables visualization of helicity-matched interfaces, identifying how chirality governs biomolecular interactions. We anticipate that this methodology can be generalized with alternative basis sets to encompass a broad range of chiral symmetries governing biological signaling, polarization optics, drug design, and advanced synthesis.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

I.; Singh, A.; Kabir, A.", "abstract": "Protein folding stability is a key determinant for understanding protein dynamics, including molecular function, pathogenicity, and/or protein engineering. Yet, accurate prediction of protein stability changes remains a challenging problem due to the high-variability in the available data, especially from sequence-only information when structural knowledge is of low-resolution or unavailable. In this work, we introduce LoMuS, a Multimodal deep learning model that combines two complimentary aspects of the molecule and predicts unnormalized protein Stability effect from the primary sequence as input. In the core of the model architecture, a fusion network integrates explicit physicochemical descriptors with Low-rank adapted protein language model derived embeddings from the sequence that shows powerful and accurate generalization ability across various benchmark settings for predicting protein folding stability changes. We compared and rigorously evaluated our model capacity spanning from fold-induced stability changes to mutation caused stability effect prediction. This includes benchmarking against various held-out protein domains, out-of-distribution label settings and per-protein evaluation. LoMuS consistently outperforms other sequence-only protein stability baselines. It achieves an absolute performance gain by an at least 10% in the spearman rank correlation metric for predicting protein stability across many held-out domains and out-of-distribution stability label predictions. Per-protein validation additionally demonstrates promising performance gain of our model. Ablation analysis on the model architectural choices confirms that complementary signals from derived features are critical for this multimodal approach. We believe LoMuS advances protein engineering research and can aid in rational protein design by elucidating precise protein stability changes.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Super-resolution imaging combined with block-copolymer theory identifies ELKS and RIM as the minimal pair sufficient to reproduce this ordered lattice, mediated by orthogonal interactions between ELKS coiled-coil domains and RIM intrinsically disordered regions. Additional active zone proteins, including RIMBP and Liprin-, modulate lattice spacing and morphology in a stoichiometry-dependent manner, coupling nanoscale order to neurotransmission.

This study identifies novel signaling pathway promoting pro-proliferative phenotype of VSMC and contributing to the neointimal hyperplasia development. Methods: The expression of hypusine signaling components was evaluated in human primary culture of coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CoASMCs) isolated from controls and patients with CAD, using comparative proteomic analysis and western blotting, as well as in three preclinical animal models of restenosis; rat carotid injury, mice carotid ligation and canine coronary artery bypass graft. CAD-CoASMCs proliferation was assessed by western blot and immunofluorescence with pharmacological (GC7) and molecular (shRNA) inhibitors of deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS). The contribution of hypusine signaling to neointimal hyperplasia was investigated using both pharmacological and smooth muscle cell-specific knockout mice approaches. Additionally, human saphenous vein and human coronary artery tissue cultures were employed to explore the translational potential of targeting hypusine signaling to prevent neointimal hyperplasia. Results: All components of the hypusine pathway (eukaryote translational initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) and DHPS) were significantly overexpressed in CAD-CoASMCs and in preclinical animal models of restenosis. Pharmacological and molecular inhibition of DHPS reduced eIF5A hypusination, VSMC proliferation and expression of extracellular matrix proteins. Proteomic and KEGG analyses demonstrated disruption of cell cycle and DNA replication pathways, including a downregulation of threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK). Our findings suggest that TTK acts as a downstream effector of hypusine signaling, partly mediating to the proliferative effects observed in CAD-CoASMCs. In vivo, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of DHPS significantly reduced neointimal hyperplasia without adverse effects. Finally, ex vivo human tissue culture confirmed that GC7 mitigates growth factor-induced vascular remodeling. Conclusions: Hypusine signaling is a critical regulator of VSMC proliferation for neointimal hyperplasia. Inhibiting DHPS reduces vascular remodeling, making it a promising target for preventing restenosis after coronary interventions.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction are considered to be key components of skeletal muscle dysfunction, but comprehensive profiling of metabolic pathways has not been conducted. Elucidation of dysregulated metabolic pathways is essential to determine viable targets for the treatment of exercise intolerance in HFpEF. Methods: Male ZSF1 Obese rats (HFpEF) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) lean normotensive controls were studied at 26 weeks of age. Gastrocnemius was subjected to bulk RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics analysis. The R package limma was used to determine differential expression in all omics layers (absolute fold-change>1.5, FDR0.05, unless otherwise indicated). Additional targeted plasma and skeletal muscle (soleus and EDL) metabolomics and lipidomics were performed on HFpEF and control rats. Results: Pathway-level analysis for RNA seq and proteomics revealed significant downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain, and TCA cycle. The most upregulated pathways were PPAR signaling, tryptophan metabolism, and amino acid oxidation pathways. Metabolomics revealed an accumulation of TCA cycle intermediate, isocitrate, and phosphate reduction. Branched-chain amino acids were significantly increased, whereas amino acids related to tryptophan metabolism were reduced and shifted towards increased serotonin accumulation. Phospholipid species were differentially regulated with increased palmitoylated phosphatidylcholines but reduced arachidonoyl-PC species. Phosphatidylethanolamine species were increased. Conclusion: Our multiomics analysis of skeletal muscle in HFpEF revealed severe mitochondrial dysfunction that was characterized by reduced complex I and II activity. Mitochondrial and peroxisomal lipid overload results in a shift in membrane phospholipid accumulation and composition. Reduced BCAA oxidation and dysregulation of tryptophan metabolism are key features of amino acid metabolism that reduce anaplerosis and promote the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Comparative analysis of other skeletal muscle disorders suggests that an acquired metabolic myopathy exists in cardiometabolic HFpEF.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Genetic strategies targeting lignin biosynthesis offer a promising alternative to improve biomass digestibility without relying on energy-intensive pretreatments. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 editing to disrupt the caffeic-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT1) in Setaria viridis, a C monocot model related to major bioenergy crops. COMT1 was selected based on its strong expression in lignifying tissues and its central role in the biosynthesis of syringyl (S) units, guaiacyl (G) units, and the flavone tricin, a non-canonical lignin monomer in grasses. Edited plants showed no visible growth defects, maintaining normal development and salt-stress tolerance. Chemical analyses revealed a drastic reduction in S units and tricin, accompanied by moderate but significant decreases in G and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) monomers. Despite these compositional changes, total soluble lignin content was only slightly reduced, suggesting compensatory incorporation of non-canonical monomers. Metabolome analysis of edited plants suggested a redirection of carbon flux towards phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways. These modifications resulted in a substantial increase in saccharification efficiency, demonstrating that COMT1 disruption can enhance biomass digestibility without compromising plant viability.

Previously, genomic studies have identified Agrobacterium-derived sequences in the sweet potato genome. Among these, the IbACS (Agrocinopine Synthase) gene encodes an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of agrocinopine A, a sugar-phosphodiester opine that can be metabolized and utilized by specific microorganisms harboring the corresponding catabolic enzymes. Because IbACS has been conserved in cultivated sweet potato varieties, it is suggested that endogenous agrocinopine production by sweet potato contributes to interactions with environmental microbes, thereby supporting plant growth under nutrient-limited conditions. To test this hypothesis, we generated IbACS-disrupted lines using genome editing. Growth of the knockout plants was markedly reduced in non-sterile soil, while no difference was observed in sterile conditions. These results suggest that the role of IbACS is linked to interactions with the microbial community rather than to intrinsic plant development. Metagenomic analyses of rhizosphere communities revealed that IbACS disruption caused extensive remodeling of microbial composition, including strong reductions in Proteobacteria taxa such as Oxalobacteraceae and decreases in key genera like Massilia and Ensifer, along with lower community evenness and the expansion of opportunistic minor taxa. Together, these microbial shifts indicate that IbACS is required for the assembly of a functionally supportive rhizosphere microbiome that promotes sweet potato growth in soil environments.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Aim To assess wheat seed vigour and grain quality after Blown-Arc plasma treatment. Methods Wheat seeds were treated with Blown-Arc plasma for 60 or 180 s from a distance of 21 cm in a closed environment to assess in vitro germination, seed quality, seedling emergence, and crop yield in the field. Key Results Seeds treated with Blown-Arc plasma showed significantly faster initial in vitro germination (day 4), although total germination by day 8 was similar to untreated controls. In the field, the treated seed showed no significant difference in seedling emergence in 2020, but in 2021 seed treated for 180 s produced a significantly lower number of seedlings, possibly due to differences in the soil microbial environment. The wheat grown from 180 s Blown-Arc plasma-treated seed produced more heads per plant; however, overall yield was unchanged. The treatment had no adverse effect on grain quality parameters, all remaining within acceptable Australian standards. Conclusions Blown-Arc plasma did not alter seedling emergence, yield, or grain quality properties of the crop produced from treated wheat seeds. Implications Blown-arc plasma is a safe treatment that can potentially increase wheat seed germination without affecting grain quality or yield. Faster germination of seeds when sown under adequate moisture may promote healthy root systems and plant growth.

K.; Breen, I.; Alais, D.; Rideaux, R.", "abstract": "Sequentially presented visual stimuli are often employed to investigate the temporal limits of our visual perception and attention. Due to the finite nature of the brains' processing capacity, experimental designs attempt to increase temporal separation within series to mitigate potential neural interference between stimuli. This is achieved through shortening of stimulus durations and lengthening of interstimulus intervals. Across two experiments, we parametrically varied these parameters for a serially presented checkerboard wedge stimulus and used inverted encoding modelling to assess the fidelity of the neural representation of spatial location. We found longer interstimulus intervals and shorter stimulus durations produced the most reliable decoding. Varying interstimulus interval altered the fidelity of neural representations via inter-item interference. By contrast, the influence of stimulus duration seemed largely analytic; in a fixed duration block, shorter stimulus duration enabled more presentations, which led to increased decoding accuracy. Distinct anticipatory and reactionary neural events were observed for stimuli presented in triplet sequences, which seemed consistent with forwards and backwards visual masking. The absence of an anticipatory event was observed when backward masking was stronger while a reactionary event was present for every stimulus subjected to forward masking.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

In the cytosol, the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is scaffolded on IQGAP1 to facilitate the activation of Akt by the synthesis of PI3,4,5P3. In the nucleus, PIPn signaling occurs in regions devoid of membranes via their stable association with proteins. While several of these proteins have been identified, understanding the extent and impact of protein-linked PIPn signaling warrants further investigation. The tumor suppressor p53, was shown in the companion paper to be regulated by PI transfer proteins (PITPs) and a PI 4-kinase (PI4KII), which are required to form p53-PIPn complexes that assemble a nuclear PI3K/Akt pathway. Here we report that class I PITPs (PITP/{beta}) and PI 4-kinase initiate PIPn linkages to many different proteins. PITP/{beta} and PI4KII accumulate in the nucleoplasm in response to stress and are necessary to synthesize nuclear PIPns linked to proteins. These PITP/{beta}-dependent protein-PIPn complexes are detected by metabolically labeling cells with the PIPn precursor [H3]-myo-inositol and resist denaturation and SDS-PAGE, indicating that these protein-PIPn complexes represent a putative posttranslational modification. Proteomic analyses of proteins that are regulated by PITP/{beta} and/or are linked to PI4,5P2 have identified an emerging PIPylome that is enriched in metabolic, signaling, cytoskeletal and DNA repair pathway components. Taken together, these data provide evidence for an emerging proteome with linked PIPns that represent a PIPn signaling paradigm that is distinct from the membrane-localized pathway but utilizes many of the same PIP kinases and phosphatases.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

We observe that cells undergoing their first division under hypo-osmotic stress experience delayed mitotic entry, lengthened mitotic duration, elevated mitotic errors and aneuploidy formation. However, continued cell division is halted through a p53/p21-dependent G1 arrest. p53 activation occurs post-mitotically and is associated with hyper-condensed chromatin and impaired nuclear expansion in daughter cells after mitotic exit. We show that the altered nuclear size dynamics lead to nuclear accumulation of p53 and activation of downstream gene expression.

Hyperactivation of LRRK2, which is thought to cause PD, occurs on stressed endolysosomal membranes via CASM (conjugation of ATG8 to single membranes) and Rab, whereas the involvement of specific membrane lipids remained unclear. Here, we found that LRRK2 was potently activated upon treatment with PIKfyve inhibitors that increase cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) levels, and that additional treatment with the class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors blocking PI3P generation suppressed LRRK2 activation. Cellular PI3P levels were indeed correlated with the LRRK2 kinase activity. CASM-induced LRRK2 activation, but not CASM itself, was suppressed by PI3K inhibitors, whereas inhibition of CASM or Rab12/Rab29 suppressed LRRK2 activation induced by PIKfyve inhibitors. LRRK2 and phospho-Rab10 were co-localized with PI3P on LAMP1-positive enlarged vacuoles, and LRRK2 directly bound PI3P in vitro via its N-terminal positively charged amino acids.

Exposure to 10 mg/L AuNS for 72 h results in significantly stronger inhibition of algal growth and photosynthetic activity compared to the same concentration of AuNP. Morphometric profiling reveals that AuNS induced pronounced structural injury, including cell enlargement, debris production, and disruption of subcellular organization than AuNP. Confocal imaging suggested this heightened toxicity may stem from distinct internalization patterns, with AuNP primarily adhering to chloroplast surfaces, whereas AuNS penetrated more deeply into intracellular compartments. RNA sequencing identified 9 upregulated and 38 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 10 mg/L AuNP treated cells, impairing photosynthesis and energy storage via the photosystem II subunit S1 (PSBS1)/ early light-inducible protein (ELI3) pathway.

Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of hypoxia in the murine Achilles tendon enthesis and elucidated the role of Hif1a in enthesis cell survival and ECM formation using Scleraxis-lineage conditional knockout (ScxCre; Hif1a cKO) mice. We found that while neonatal tendons rapidly resolve hypoxia after birth, the enthesis maintains a hypoxic niche through postnatal day 5, mirroring a gradient observed in growth plates. Disruption of HIF-1 in enthesis-resident cells resulted in pronounced deficits in grip strength, abnormal tendon-bone attachment morphology, disrupted calcaneal architecture, impaired mineralization, and significant ECM disorganization.

We describe Polymerase-Enabled Rapid and Frugal Error Correcting Technology (PERFECT) PCR, which integrates PCR with hyperthermophilic EndoNucS enzymes for efficient DNA mismatch detection and cleavage, enabling accurate and fast DNA synthesis using overlapping oligonucleotides. This approach reduced latency while streamlining the overall DNA synthesis process, achieving significantly lower error rates in amplicons compared to state-of-the-art methods, thereby reducing physical redundancy. Specifically, we achieved a substantially reduced error rate of 0.06 errors per kilobase, with 95% of sequences verified as accurate.

We further validated the versatility of PERFECT PCR by successfully encoding and retrieving digital images, music files, and multilingual text files with near-perfect information recovery.

Despite remarkable progress has been made in PRAD diagnosis and prognosis, Black American men have been found to have disproportionately high incidence and mortality rate in PRAD compared with non-Hispanic White men in the United States. While machine learning (ML) methods like transfer learning (TL) have shown promise in reducing racial disparities in PRAD, its effectiveness is often compromised by the requirement for large-scale training datasets, which are challenging to obtain in clinical settings. In addition, existing ML approaches only leverage single-omics data without integrating multi-omics information. To address these concerns, we propose a novel approach called MOTLPRAD that develops a Multi-Omics integration Transfer Learning framework to reduce health disparities in PRAD. Specifically, we first investigated two multi-modal ensemble methods, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) based patient-pairwise similarity and variational autoencoder (VAE), to integrate different types of omics data. Then, we adopted a transfer learning model based on domain adaptation to pre-train the model on the majority group (e.g., non-Hispanic White Americans) and fine-tune the model using the minority group (e.g., Black Americans). To mitigate data imbalance across different ethnic groups, we leveraged the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to augment the sample size of minority groups, which could further improve the performance of reducing health disparities in PRAD. Results based on a series of multi-omics data (mRNA, miRNA, and methylation) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database suggested that our proposed model significantly outperformed conventional transfer learning models and other computational models for reducing racial disparities when predicting progression-free interval (PFI) prognosis for PRAD patients.

Here, we investigate motor unit (MU) recruitment flexibility in the human first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle while controlling for overall muscle activation across two functionally distinct tasks using high-density intramuscular EMG (HD-iEMG) electrode arrays. Six participants performed isometric index finger abduction where the FDI serves as the prime mover, and flexion with the FDI functioning as a synergist. Recruitment thresholds (RTs) and recruitment orders (ROs) were highly consistent within the same task, but differed significantly between abduction and flexion. Across participants, 45.3% of MUs showed changes in recruitment above the coefficient of repeatability across tasks compared to only 5.0% within tasks. Changes in RT were accompanied by corresponding adaptations in discharge rate (DR), preserving the inverse RT-DR relationship. MU size did not have an effect on recruitment variability. Intramuscular coherence analysis revealed no differences in the delta (1-5 Hz) or alpha (5-13 Hz) band, but beta band (13-30 Hz) coherence was significantly lower during flexion than abduction, indicating reduced high-frequency inputs when FDI serves as a synergist muscle. Together, these results indicate different distributions of net excitatory input to FDI MUs across different functional tasks, that may include stronger involvement of spinal circuits during flexion as opposed to abduction, as indicated by the reduced intramuscular beta coherence. Moreover, the present findings also demonstrate that common synaptic input and not intrinsic motor neuron properties determines the inverse relation between MU RT and DR.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

S.; Bhardwaj, S.; Dev, A. S.; Dominick, A.; Bajaj, C.", "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is increasingly understood as a disorder of distributed brain circuits, yet most imaging analyses do not explicitly respect pathway structure. We introduce a pathway anchored, multimodal clustering framework based on Scalable Robust Variational Compositional Co-clustering (SRVCC) that integrates structural MRI, free water corrected diffusion MRI, and DAT-SPECT in anatomically defined circuits. For each pathway, we derive a simple Multimodal Pathway Integrity Score (MPIS) that aggregates z normalised volume, microstructural, and dopaminergic measures into an interpretable summary of imaging integrity. In the PPMI cohort, SRVCC identifies stable imaging-derived patient clusters and feature modules under explicit model selection and bootstrap/stability checks, with covariate-adjusted analyses controlling for age, sex, education, medication, and scanner. MPIS shows coherent but modest structure function associations: lower nigrostriatal and frontostriatal integrity relates to higher motor burden (UPDRS-III), while reduced sensory/visuospatial and limbic integrity is linked to lower global cognition (MoCA); microvascular markers robustly stratify imaging profiles but display minimal cross-sectional coupling to these global scales. Feature-level reports highlight dominant region by modality contributors (e.g., striatal DAT-SBR, thalamic and cerebellar morphology, white-matter hyperintensity metrics), providing a transparent bridge from multimodal data to circuit-level signatures. This pathway-aware representation offers a principled, reproducible way to summarise multimodal imaging in PD and may support future work on circuit-informed stratification, prognosis, and targeted outcome measures.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) pores are important in the human innate immune response to directly kill pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. MAC pores assemble when complement proteins in serum are activated on bacteria and convert complement protein C5 into C5b, which together with C6, C7, C8, and multiple copies of C9 form a pore that damages the bacterial envelope. Due to rising multidrug-resistant infections with Gram-negative pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpn), there is interest in developing complement-activating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that trigger MAC-dependent killing. However, some Kpn strains resist MAC-dependent killing in serum despite potent complement activation and C5 conversion, revealing a critical gap in understanding how these strains resist MAC-dependent killing. We demonstrate that Kpn strains can resist MAC-dependent killing through a paradoxical mechanism of excessively converting C5, which limits C9 polymerisation and subsequent killing. In these strains, spiking serum with supplementary C9 restored killing. Additionally, partially inhibiting C5 conversion using complement inhibitors increased C9 polymerisation and subsequent killing. This suggests that these Kpn strains are in principle sensitive to MAC-dependent killing, but an imbalance between generated C5b and available C9 in serum limits C9 polymerisation and prevents killing. We also observed this paradoxical effect with an of excess complement-activating mAbs on Kpn strains that are typically susceptible to MAC-dependent killing in serum. Excessive C5 conversion was responsible for this reduced killing, as supplementary C9 restored killing. Lastly, in neonatal plasma, where C9 is naturally limited, complement-activating mAbs induced killing of Kpn only in the presence of supplementary C9. Our study highlights that the balance between C5 conversion and available C9 is important for MAC-dependent killing of Kpn. Additionally, absence of killing in serum does not necessarily indicate that Kpn strains are MAC-resistant. These insights are important for interpreting mAb efficacy in serum bactericidal assays and in complement-deficient populations.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Methods: We used targeted metabolomics to systematically profile Trp- and NAD+-related metabolites across multiple biological compartments - including tissues, luminal contents, stool, and serum - in mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) alone or in combination with a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ABX) cocktail. Results: Microbial depletion significantly attenuated colitis and increased host Trp bioavailability, implicating the gut microbiota as a competitive Trp consumer. In DSS colitis, Trp degradation along the kynurenine pathway (KP) was exaggerated but blocked at the key KP enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), resulting in mucosal NAD(H) depletion. ABX co-treatment normalized metabolite conversion along the KP and restored mucosal NAD(H) levels, revealing a dual role of the gut microbiota during colitis: while they compete with the host for Trp utilization, they simultaneously shape host KP regulation and NAD+ de novo synthesis, supporting host energy homeostasis. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that mucosal NAD+ de novo synthesis is a microbially regulated metabolic process that alleviates intestinal inflammation and may represent a novel therapeutic target in IBD through modulation of the gut microbiota or their metabolites.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

The data used for the study were based on 13 polymorphic SNPs markers, 47 morphological and 23 phytochemical traits (18 amino acids and 5 polyphenols). The morphological variables involved 18 qualitative and 29 quantitative variables of cowpea vegetative and yield and yield-related traits whereas the phytochemical traits involved. Genetic linkage mapping and QTL mapping were performed by using the software QTLiCIMapping version 4.2. All the 18 qualitative markers were polymorphic. Eleven linkage groups were detected at a LOD score of 4. Fourteen markers were distributed on chromosome 1. A total of 79 QTLs were identified which were distributed over four linkage groups. Contributions of the QTLs to percentage phenotypic variation ranged from 0.00% to 27.62% (quercetin). Multiple QTLs located at the same location were identified on chromosomes 1 and 4 indicating potential pleiotropy. QTLs identified for seed related traits were mapped to the same region on chromosome 4. QTLs for the vegetative traits namely, number of branches, number of leaves and branch length were mapped on the same region on chromosome 4. The identification of moderate- to large-effect QTLs on chromosome 4, especially qSDWG4.1, offers promising targets for seed weight improvement in cowpea.  A total of 42 QTLs were detected for amino acids, most of which were located on chromosome 1, with additional loci on chromosomes 4, 7, and 9. Nine QTLs were identified for phenolic acids. Two QTLs for the flavonoids rutin and quercetin were mapped to a shared region on chromosome 4. This study provided an integrated QTL framework for morphological, reproductive, amino acid, and phenolic traits in cowpea, revealing major genomic regions on chromosomes 1 and 4 that controlled both domesticated-related and nutritional traits.

Building on our previous study, which used composite behavioral scores, we investigates the transgenerational inheritance patters of individual behaviors and found a robust, male-lineage-dependent increase in swimming across unexposed G2-G4 female offspring.

We here present an accessible alternative towards single-molecule FRET based on Brick-MIC, a recently introduced 3D-printed micro-spectroscopy platform. The FRET-Brick uses continuous-wave excitation at 488 nm with a minimal set of opto-mechanical components and photomultiplier detectors (PMTs). With this we were able to significantly reduce the setup complexity retaining single-molecule sensitivity with dyes matching the sensitivity of PMTs. To maximize the photon output of Alexa488, ATTO488 (donors), Alexa555, ATTO542 and Cy3B (acceptors), we introduce ferrocene-derivatives as photostabilizers that increase both dye brightness and remove dark-states.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of romaciclib, a first-in-class CDK8/CDK19 inhibitor, in combination with VEN to overcome stroma-mediated and primary/acquired VEN-resistance. We assessed the efficacy of RVU120+VEN combination in both sensitive and resistant AML cell lines and primary patient-derived models. Our finding demonstrated that romaciclib synergizes with VEN in AML cell lines and in 8 out of 11 patient-derived cell samples. The proteomic and functional studies demonstrated that combination induced apoptosis through caspase-dependent cleavage of MCL-1. In vivo studies confirmed the efficacy of RVU120+VEN, showing eradication of leukemic cells and bone marrow recovery. Importantly, the combination effectively overcame both stroma-mediated and transcriptionally dependent VEN-resistance. Mechanistic studies, focusing on transcriptomic analyses, identified key resistance-associated pathways, including IL6/JAK/STAT3, TGF-{beta}, PI3K/AKT/MTOR, and inflammatory signaling, being suppressed by combination treatment.

Stromal vascular remodeling prominently features expansion of Gdf15- and Trem2-expressing lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs), which respond to adipocyte stress and act as lipid scavengers to buffer excess lipids released by adipocytes. Here, we examined macrophage reprogramming in p21+/Tert and p21+/TertCi mice, which express active TERT or its catalytically inactive TERTCi mutant from the endogenous Cdkn1a promoter. Results: Following HFD exposure, conditional expression of TERT or TERTCi resulted in a pronounced downregulation of p21 in macrophage subsets, accompanied by a reduction in AT inflammation. Notably, TERT and TERTCi expression reshaped the adipose-tissue macrophage (ATM) landscape depleting Trem2+ and Gdf15+; LAMs while preserving resident macrophages. This shift was accompanied by marked suppression of the Trem2 transcriptional program and down-regulation of PPARg and NR1H3 in LAMs and by impaired ASPC-LAM signaling pathways that normally drive LAM recruitment and activation. Proteomic profiling further showed that p21+/Tert ASPCs secreted markedly higher levels of proteins associated with non-conventional secretion, while extracellular matrix-associated factors and cytokines/chemokines including key mediators of ASPC-LAM communication such as Ccl2, C3, and Csf1 were substantially reduced. However, only p21+/Tert mice, and not p21+/TertCi mice, exhibited significant metabolic improvements, indicating that macrophage remodeling alone is insufficient to restore systemic metabolic function. Consistent with this, enhanced ASPC expansion and differentiation, supporting improved adipose-tissue remodeling, was observed exclusively in p21+/Tert obese mice. Conclusions: TERT remodels adipose tissue immunity independently of its enzymatic activity, and TERT-driven reprogramming of the ASPC secretome may emerge as a promising strategy to combat obesity-related metabolic dysfunction.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Behavioral and EEG data were collected, and drift-diffusion model (DDM) was used to decompose different components. After observing an opposing preference, risk-seeking participants chose safety options more often, and risk-aversion participants chose risky options more often, indicating social influence.

Social influence altered two distinct components in risky decisions: the weight of amount in value computation (more negative after observing the opposing model) and the starting point (shifting toward the options chosen more often). Multivariate pattern analysis linked these components to distinct neural signatures: theta activity ({approx}500 ms after option onset) tracked the amount weighting, whereas pre-option beta activity tracked the starting point.

Recent analysis suggests that functional variability is explained by linear non-shape-based traits and that shape variation is largely explained by phylogeny. We assay the relationship between wing planform shape and functional performance using a theoretical morphospace approach that eschews assumptions of the functional optimality of empirical morphologies. Empirical properties are considered post hoc relative to their positions in the functional performance landscapes. We produce a theoretical morphospace of wing planform shapes and compare the functional performance and optimality of theoretical shapes with 1139 extant taxa. These tests cover flight metrics and combinations linked with 7 flight niches. Metrics pertaining to agile flight strongly constrain shape, with hovering, diving and hawking birds developing optimal planforms. Marine soarers are suboptimal for metrics linked with efficient and manoeuvrable flight. Many taxa, principally passerines, remain suboptimal for all studied metrics and combinations. This suggests flight performance constrains planforms unevenly across birds. Phylomorphospace analysis suggests planform shape is only weakly influenced by phylogeny and functional optimality correlates closely with flight styles.

We reveal significant defects in peripheral B cell tolerance in FMS, including: (1) impaired naive B cell anergy, marked by elevated CD21, CD22, and CD24 expression; (2) exaggerated proliferative responses and rapid CD24 downregulation upon stimulation; and (3) altered BCR selection patterns, with increased IGHV6-1/IGHJ6 usage, skewed class switching toward IGHA1, and enhanced heavy chain clonal expansion. These features closely resemble immune pathology profiles observed in classical autoimmune diseases. These findings redefine FMS as a disorder of immune dysregulation, with defective B cell tolerance contributing to disease mechanisms. The convergence of interferon-driven B cell activation, heavy chain clonal expansion, and autoantibody production suggests shared pathways with classical autoimmune diseases. Our study provides a foundation for mechanism-based diagnostics and targeted immunomodulatory therapies, offering new avenues for intervention in this debilitating condition.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

While their functional diversity and tissue-specific roles are tightly regulated by transcriptional networks, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The transcription factor basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 3 (BATF3) plays a central role in the development of conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s). Here, we unveil BATF3 as a critical cell-intrinsic regulator of the homeostasis, functional specialisation, and tissue distribution of {gamma}{delta} T cells. Batf3-deficient mice display an altered composition of {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets, with a marked decrease in the numbers of innate-like {gamma}{delta} T cells across multiple organs when compared to their wild-type counterparts, independently of cDC1s. Loss of BATF3 impacts not only cell survival but also IL-17 production after {gamma}{delta} T cells complete their thymic development. Mechanistically, Batf3-deficient innate-like {gamma}{delta} T cells exhibit transcriptional changes that disrupt pathways governing actin cytoskeleton remodelling, immunological synapse organisation and cellular identity. Notably, Batf3-deficient mice present decreased survival in a viral infection model highly dependent on innate-like {gamma}{delta} T cells.

This study is the first to identify and validate suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in A. domesticus across different tissues, an essential step for accurate quantification of host and pathogen target gene expression. Six candidate reference genes commonly used in insects (AdoNEOPT, EF2, 18S rRNA, EF1, Histone H3, and GAPDH) were evaluated for expression stability in five tissue types (abdomen, legs, wings, head, and whole body). Gene stability was assessed using five computational tools: BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, Delta Ct, and the integrated platform RefFinder. Additional validation was performed using the R statistical software. The results identified EF1, AdoNEOPT, EF2, and 18S rRNA as the most stable reference genes across all the selected tissues, while GAPDH and His H3 showed high variability and were generally unsuitable except in the head, where GAPDH demonstrated stable expression. This study provides the first validated set of reference genes for A. domesticus, laying a foundation for accurate and reproducible gene expression studies.

Climate change poses extreme risks to biodiversity, threatening the ecosystems upon which humanity depends. Understanding the traits that mediate how organisms respond to climatic gradients in space and time will enable better predictions of the taxa and ecological communities most at risk from warming. 2. In insects, colouration influences thermoregulation, but warming responses must be traded off against other selective pressures. We hypothesise that butterfly wing reflectance in visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra respond differently to temperature and ultraviolet radiation over space and time. We combined existing reflectance data of 97 butterfly species in both NIR and visible wavelengths, with long-term abundance monitoring data of 120 butterfly communities sampled across 1650 m altitude gradients from May to August in two time periods (2004/5 and 2017). 3. The visible and NIR reflectances of butterfly communities showed a non-linear relationship with altitude, with the lowest reflectance (darkest butterflies) at the coolest, highest sites. In contrast, community visible reflectance decreased through the year as temperatures warmed over spring-summer, whereas community NIR reflectance remained constant, revealing divergent responses of reflectance types to seasonal changes. Temperature had opposing effects on visible and NIR reflectance of butterfly communities, where increasing temperature reduced community visible reflectance strongly while increasing community NIR reflectance slightly. 4. Considering the effects on reflectance of shared evolutionary history in a Bayesian hierarchical model for individual species, lighter-coloured (more reflective) species were associated with warmer temperatures - flying later in spring-summer or at lower altitudes. However, instead of decreasing in reflectance through the year and across temperature gradients, species instead became lighter, we expect as a result of a Simpson's paradox. 5. These results emphasise how visible and NIR reflectance wavelength bands mediate butterflies' responses to environmental gradients in distinct ways, despite being highly correlated across species. We also show that incorporating phylogeny into trait-environment models is essential; relying on traits alone would lead to incorrect inferences and predictions of taxa most at risk from warming climates.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

A. baumannii isolates with publicly available whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data and carbapenem-specific antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results were compiled (n = 1,601). Unitigs were extracted from de novo assemblies, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called from raw sequence reads mapped to seven selected reference genomes. The population was highly clonal and comprised ten lineages, including three predominantly resistant ST2 lineages. The known CRAB-associated loci, including OXA-23, the RND efflux pump regulator AdeL, and an OXA-66 substitution (Leu167Val), were readily identified. Novel resistance-associated mutations were detected in outer-membrane proteins, including porins (OprD, DcaP) and proteins (PqiB, LptD) involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biogenesis.

Here, we reconstituted the antiviral complex from independently purified DCR-1{middle dot}DRH-1 and RDE-4 to define how RDE-4 stabilizes and activates the complex. Addition of recombinant RDE-4 restored ATP hydrolysis and dsRNA cleavage to levels previously observed with the pre-assembled complex, and time-course assays revealed that RDE-4 is essential for maintaining DCR-1{middle dot}DRH-1 activity. Mutational analysis of RDE-4 revealed that both dsRBM2 and dsRBM3, but not dsRBM1, are required for reconstituting ATP hydrolysis and cleavage. Disruption of the KKxAK motif in dsRBM2 drastically reduced dsRNA affinity and abolished catalytic rescue despite preserving robust binding to DCR-1{middle dot}DRH-1. Mass photometry and pulldown assays revealed that RDE-4 primarily forms DCR-1 containing complexes, predominantly through interaction with dsRBM3, with no evidence for stable interaction with DRH-1 alone. Functionally, RDE-4 enhanced DRH-1-driven ATP hydrolysis on both 52 and 106 base-pair dsRNAs, but cleavage efficiency showed strong length dependence, implicating dsRNA substrate length as an effector in this system. Our findings establish RDE-4 as an important stabilizer of the antiviral complex and reveal distinct roles for dsRBM2 and dsRBM3 in ATP hydrolysis and dsRNA cleavage. Furthermore, our results suggest that substrate length modulates RDE-4 function, not just alone, but within the antiviral complex.

Specifically, rBMAds release free fatty acids (FFAs) through a non-canonical lipolytic pathway and these FFAs are taken up by PCa cells inducing a transcriptional reprogramming that promotes motility. Among the responsive genes, Angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4) is the most upregulated via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma}-dependent mechanism, and its silencing abolishes the rBMAd-driven migratory and invasive phenotype.

O.; Biel, M.; Leibold, C.; Fenske, S.; Wahl-Schott, C.", "abstract": "The heart's ability to beat with high precision, with a regular and steady rhythm relies on the synchronised activity of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN), which communicate with one another through gap junctions. This process ensures that electrical impulses are organised and reach a critical mass to ignite the electrical activity of the surrounding atrial tissue and trigger the regular heartbeat. Hypothesis: We hypothesise that hyperpolarisation-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels play a pivotal role in maintaining this synchronisation process. This idea aligns with the well-established role of HCN channels in stabilising the membrane potential in the voltage range of the slow diastolic depolarisation, counteracting voltage fluctuations and effectively filtering out variations in the beating rate from neighbouring cells. Aim: We focus on two specific HCN channel subtypes (HCN1 and HCN4) and their contributions to the rapid synchronisation of pacemaker cells, a phenomenon known as phasic entrainment. Using two HCN channel-mutant mouse models, we dissect the distinct roles of HCN1 and HCN4 in this process. Methods: We employed patch-clamp electrophysiology to determine phase response curves (PRCs) to predict the ability of single cells to interact in the SAN. Using computer simulations, the behaviour of the SAN at the network level was determined. Results: We found that HCN1, but not HCN4, is essential for the fast synchronisation of pacemaker cells in the SAN and propose a mechanism by which HCN1 channels regulate this process. Conclusion: These findings highlight HCN1 as a critical component for ensuring the precise and rapid coordination needed for synchronisation of the SAN, for a regular and consistent heartbeat. Translational perspective: Our work provides essential insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing SAN function and lays the groundwork for several clinically relevant applications. Understanding how If blockers may affect heart rate and rhythm stability is crucial for assessing potential side effects of current and future subtype-specific HCN channel inhibitors.

Emerging evidence suggests that specific central nervous system (CNS) regions modulate its progression via neuroimmune cardiovascular interfaces (NICIs). While the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is known to participate in atherogenesis by regulating immune cell dynamics and vascular wall responses, the role of neural CXCR4 in atherosclerotic plaque formation remains unclear. Methods We generated a Nestin-Cre-mediated conditional Cxcr4 knockout mouse model on a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr-ko) background and fed these mice a western diet (WD) for up to 12 weeks to induce atherosclerosis. To evaluate the impact of neural CXCR4 function, we quantified atherosclerotic plaque burden, systemic metabolic parameters and circulating immune cell profiles, comparing neural Cxcr4-deficient mice with corresponding genetic controls. Spatial transcriptomics and RNAscope were employed to map Cxcr4 mRNA and its non-canonical ligand macrophage migration inhibitory factor (Mif) mRNA in neuroimmune-regulatory brain regions, and to assess diet-induced expression changes in relation to neuroinflammatory responses. Results Neural conditional deletion of Cxcr4 in Ldlr-ko mice significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in the aortic arch and aorta, without affecting body weight, lipid levels, glucose tolerance, or circulating immune cells. Cxcr4 gene expression was found to be uniformly low across hypothalamic subregions implicated in neuroimmune regulation of systemic inflammation and atherogenesis. Importantly, WD feeding did not modify this consistently low expression in male Ldlr-ko mice. In contrast, Mif mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in the PVN after 5-day WD feeding, but not after 8 weeks. Exploratory spatial transcriptomic analysis of PVN-containing coronal brain sections from male Ldlr-ko mice suggested that 5-day WD exposure activated MIF-CXCR4 signaling and downstream neuroinflammatory pathways in the PVN. Conclusions This study identifies neural CXCR4 as a component of neuroimmune modulation in atherosclerosis, exerting its effect independently of systemic metabolic or inflammatory changes. Short-term WD exposure activated gene expression of the CXCR4 ligand Mif in the PVN, pointing to a neuroimmune axis that may promote vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque development. These findings establish a link between CNS CXCR4 and vascular disease and suggest that MIF-CXCR4-dependent neuroimmune pathways may play a role in cardiometabolic risk.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

The clinical course of KS in PLWH established on combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) resembles that of classic KS. However, no studies have so far been conducted to compare clinical and immunologic characteristics of these subtypes. Objectives: To compare the clinical and biological characteristics of HIV-associated KS in patients with well-controlled viral infection (N=21) and non-HIV associated KS (N=19). Methods: Clinical data were prospectively collected from patients treated at the National Centre for HIV malignancies at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital.

Results: Median progression free survival (mPFS) was comparable between groups. The tumour microenvironment (TME) of non-HIV associated KS was characterized by upregulation of pathways associated with adaptive and innate immunity and angiogenesis. Transcripts relating to glycolysis and endothelial to mesenchymal transition were upregulated in the TME of HIV-associated cases. Furthermore, the TME of HIV-associated cases was associated with lower infiltration of CD4 activated cell. In both cohorts, we found the expression of HHV-8 genes to positively correlate with activated CD4, CD8, NK and immune checkpoints gene expression.

In innate immunity, such adaptive responses are critical for fine-tuning host defense, enabling trained immunity or tolerance. These states have been largely attributed to long-lasting epigenetic or metabolic reprogramming. Whether prior microbial encounters can rapidly lower receptor signaling thresholds to selectively enhance responsiveness of individual innate immune receptors remains unknown. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized, non-genetic form of cellular adaptation. We show that TLR4 activation by LPS, while inducing classical endotoxin tolerance, simultaneously primes macrophages for enhanced responses to subsequent activation of the RNA sensor TLR7. Because TLR4 and TLR7 use the same signaling machinery, this indicates that they are selectively reprogrammed in this process. TLR7 training requires type I interferons and is marked by a strong increase in Myddosome assemblies at endosomal membranes, without changes in TLR7 abundance or ligand uptake.

We find fundamentally distinct transcriptional responses to proteotoxic stressors, and a systemic deficiency of mice under chronic stress to launch acute responses. While heat shock and HSP90 inhibition induce chaperones, polyQ aggregation increases RNAs linked to transcription repression, chromatin remodeling, and autophagy. Analysing wildtype and Huntington's Disease (HD) mice reveals tissue-specific transcriptional adaptations to polyQ, including repressed cell-type specific functions and altered energy metabolism. Despite profound reprogramming, remarkably few RNAs are consistently induced (Acy3, Abdh1, Tmc3) or reduced (Fos) across HD brain regions. These results emphasize cellular background in disease manifestation, and support energy metabolism and detoxifying enzymes as therapeutic targets in late-stage HD.

We utilized the Drosophila hematopoietic system to investigate the role of Gadd45 in the development of myeloid-type blood cells, employing in vivo genetics and cell biological methods. We show that the absence of Gadd45 reduces the number of crystal cells but does not significantly impact macrophage-like cell plasmatocyte differentiation. However, Gadd45 overexpression caused intermediate progenitors to differentiate into lamellocytes and plasmatocytes to transdifferentiate into lamellocytes, a response typically observed during larval stages in response to immune challenges and injury. Interestingly, Gadd45 overexpression initiated the lamellocyte differentiation program by activating a combination of Toll, JNK, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. This closely resembles the process by which specialized macrophages are derived in mammals. Moreover, Gadd45 overexpression does not induce cell death but alters the cell cycle status of hematopoietic progenitor cells. This study enhances our understanding of how Gadd45 functions during myeloid cell development.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

We documented a specific association between C. sp. 8 and two species of invasive nitidulid beetles, and a particularly strong association of the nematode with the beetle Stelidota geminata, where we recovered more nematodes per individual beetle and a higher proportion of beetles carrying nematodes for S. geminata than for the co-occurring Epuraea ocularis.

In response, reduced tillage has increasingly been promoted as a sustainable alternative for its positive impacts on soil structure, water dynamics, and biodiversity. However, reduced tillage not only favors beneficial soil-dwelling organisms, but also pests. In this field study, we examined the effects of five years of reduced tillage on the physical properties of the soil and the dynamics of Agriotes wireworm populations (Elateridae), which are increasingly widespread pests. Our results show that tillage reduction led to stable edaphic conditions and a redistribution of organic matter, creating a favorable environment for wireworms. While our results demonstrate the beneficial effects of reduced tillage on aggregate stability, they also indicate a concomitant increase in soil bulk density, suggesting a reduction in water-holding capacity. Monitoring of wireworm populations revealed their aggregated distribution and their increase in abundance in infested areas year on year. Monitoring soil moisture revealed that tillage reduction improved water dynamics, enhancing infiltration and reducing evaporation. This could potentially favor the development of wireworms. Surprisingly, wireworm size distribution showed a higher proportion of young instars in plowed plots, evidencing that, firstly, the lack of soil cover does not prevent oviposition and that injury caused by plowing targets more the last instars rather than young larvae. While reduced tillage improves key soil health indicators, our findings suggest a potential trade-off in terms of increased pest pressure. Our study highlights the importance of adopting a holistic approach when designing sustainable cropping systems, as well as considering the services and dis-services they provide.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

We examined how the composition of the skin microbiota is associated with body size and condition in two populations of eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias), at Bornholm basin (ICES subdivision 25) and in the Aland Sea (subdivision 29). These locations are characterized by differences in body size and experience distinct hydrographic conditions, including salinity, oxygen and temperature. We used 16s rRNA gene metabarcoding to compare skin microbiota diversity and composition in these populations. We found significant differences between the populations in both alpha and beta diversity, with higher microbial diversity observed in the Aland cod characterized by larger body size. Moreover, we identified a greater number of significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) metabolic pathways in Aland cod as compared to those from the Bornholm Basin, with many pathways absent in Bornholm. However, other GOs, such as those associated with the nervous system, were uniquely detected in the Bornholm cod. Differences in microbial communities can be influenced by external environmental factors, determined by the habitats where individual cod reside.

Herein, we describe the development of a long-sought conformation-specific antibody, K27-IgG, which can selectively recognize-among all ubiquitin chain types-the unique architecture of K27-linked polyubiquitin (K27-polyUb) characterized by a distinct buried K27-isopeptide bond, with high affinity (KD = 4.66 nM). This antibody was derived from synthetic antibodies initially generated via phage display, using chemically synthesized K27-linked diubiquitin (K27-diUb) as the antigen. High-resolution co-crystal structures uncovered the unique K27-diUb interface targeted by these sAbs. Subsequent reformatting of these sAbs into a full-length human immunoglobulin G (IgG) scaffold yielded K27-IgG, notably exhibiting markedly enhanced affinity without compromising selectivity. Using K27-IgG as a tool, we achieved sensitive detection and immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous K27-polyUb in cells, and delineated the intracellular interaction landscape of K27-polyUb through complementary proteomic approaches. Two key findings emerged: 1) The molecular chaperone DNAJB1 is a specific reader of K27-linked ubiquitin chains (but not other linkages) and that K27-polyUb chains themselves exhibit chaperone-like activity, suggesting a novel mechanism by which K27-polyUb regulates chaperone-mediated proteostasis; 2) The E2 enzyme UBE2Q1 assembles K27-diUb, identifying it as a potential writer for this ubiquitin chain topology. Collectively, this study establishes K27-IgG as a robust tool for deciphering the K27-linked ubiquitin code, thereby opening new avenues for investigating the biological functions of K27-linked polyubiquitination.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Oblique plane microscopy (OPM) provides a solution that features oblique illumination, rapid optical scanning, and remote focusing to achieve real-time 4D microscopy. OPM implements light sheet imaging via a single primary objective lens, making the entire space below the objective accessible for large specimens, such as living mouse brain. Yet it is challenging to adopt OPM beyond a microscopic scale (i.e. size < 1 mm), limiting its broad applications. Here we present a self-adaptive OPM that leverages Abbe's sine condition to unlock its flexibility across a range of field-of-views (FOVs) (up to 8 mm2) and resolutions (down to 2.2 {micro}m3). This versatility enables brain-wide single neuron volumetric calcium imaging in behaving larval zebrafish (1x0.4 mm2 FOV at 5 Hz) and capillary blood cell tracking in living mouse brain (>3x3 mm2 FOV) with a sweeping 0.32 mm wide volume section at 100 Hz. In optically cleared mouse brain, the flexibility allows a screen-and-zoom capability by sequentially imaging the whole brain at low-and-high magnifications to locate and resolve subcellular structures such as dendritic tress and spines.

More distinct separation between negative and positive signals enables more precise cell boundary inference and more robust marker assignment to single cells. However, inherent limitations in spatial resolution and uncertain cell boundaries can lead to spillover, where signal leaks from one cell to a neighboring cell, distorting marker intensities and leading to incorrect cell type annotation. To address these challenges, we first systematically investigated the impact of spatial resolution and segmentation variability on per-cell marker aggregation using simulated IMC datasets, establishing upper limits for reliable marker separation in cell type annotation. We further analyzed technical biases in large scale studies, demonstrating that appropriate normalization approaches can significantly reduce batch effects without compromising biological variability. Finally, we benchmarked multiple spillover correction strategies across both (semi-)simulated and real IMC datasets. Our results revealed two simple methods: spatial smoothing of intensity images followed by mean marker aggregation, or resampling of cell masks followed by mean marker aggregation and median calculation, both of which improved annotation performance. Other methods often performed worse than the baseline of simple mean aggregation.

S.", "abstract": "The formation of RNA-DNA hybrid (RDH) primers by primase is an essential step in the recruitment of DNA polymerase during replication initiation and for the synthesis of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand. In addition to primers, RDHs form through misincorporation of ribonucleotides by DNA polymerase during elongation and by formation of R-loops during transcription. R-loops are three-stranded structures that form when the nascent mRNA anneals to the template DNA strand, displacing the complementary DNA strand. The persistence of RDHs is deleterious to genome stability in all cells because they increase susceptibility to mutations, impaired replication fork progression, DNA double-stranded breaks, and genomic rearrangements. In many bacteria, it is well established that components of the replicative DNA polymerase form a macromolecular complex that can be imaged using single-molecule or ensemble fluorescence approaches. The spatiotemporal regulation of proteins involved in RDH removal during lagging-strand maturation is less clear. Here, we study three proteins that are involved in the removal of RDHs from the lagging strand during DNA replication in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis: DNA polymerase I (Pol I), FenA, and RNase HIII. We characterized the behavior of each PAmCherry-tagged lagging-strand enzyme in living cells using single-particle tracking photactivated localization microscopy. In this work, we find that all three proteins are highly mobile, suggesting residence times at their target substrates are below our temporal resolution. We also find evidence that Pol I activity is modulated through interaction with the replisome, whereas FenA and RNase HIII are regulated through access to the nucleoid. Our results provide new insight into how enzymes are recruited to resolve RDHs during lagging-strand replication in vivo.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

An alternative theory suggests that rather than specializing simply in different sensory modalities, different parts of the cortex can specialize in different types of tasks. We recently addressed this question in the olfactory domain, showing that in normosmic individuals, the primary olfactory cortex (piriform cortex) responds to unimodal auditory and visual objects, regardless of how strongly they are associated with an odor. Here, we assess whether previous olfactory experience is a prerequisite for this cross-modal processing in the piriform cortex, using a unique group of individuals born without a sense of smell (congenital anosmia; CA; n = 30). First, we were able to confirm the presence of clear visual and auditory activations in the piriform cortex of these sensory deprived individuals. As compared to normosmic controls (n = 30), these activations and associated functional connectivity, both within the piriform cortices and between piriform cortex and other regions, were altered in a modality dependent way. Our results show that life-long absence of olfactory input does not impede cross-modal activations by visual and auditory objects in the piriform cortex and are compatible with the idea of a task-based rather than modality-specific organization of this brain region.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Although it is known that persister cells resuscitate in proportion to their ribosome content, it has remained unclear whether ribosome levels also influence the formation of persister cells. Here, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to fractionate exponentially growing cells into four populations spanning low to high ribosome levels and demonstrated that cells with low ribosome content form persister cells approximately 80-fold more frequently than cells with population-average ribosome levels. These findings show that persister cell formation is inversely proportional to ribosome abundance.

Pesticide residues were extracted using an adapted QuEChERS method and analyzed by LC-MS/MS, while inorganic elements were measured by ICP-MS and ICP-AES. Our results show that land-use and seasonal changes shape contaminant patterns in bees. Vineyards left the strongest chemical footprint on bees, as indicated by the wide diversity of contaminants detected in this environment. This reflects multiple exposure to both current and historical pesticide inputs -such as copper- which can accumulate over time to potentially harmful levels.

We evaluated this CFU-16S gap and estimated the fraction potentially attributable to slow decay of 16S rRNA from dead Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) versus transition to a viable but not culturable on solid agar (VBNCSA) population. We quantified the CFU-16S gap during and following treatment in six BALB/c mouse studies and one in vitro study. Applying a two-population ordinary differential equation-based model of Mtb death and 16S rRNA decay, we estimated the fraction of the gap potentially attributable to dead Mtb. Using meta-regression, we estimated the association between CFU or 16S rRNA with relapse. For all regimens, CFU fell more than 16S rRNA, ranging from isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol (CFU decreased 39-times more than 16S rRNA at week 4) to bedaquiline-pretomanid-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide (CFU decreased >500,000-times more). The two-population model suggested that the fraction of the CFU-16S gap attributable to residual 16S rRNA from dead Mtb is modest and decreases over time. After treatment, 16S rRNA often fell while CFU rose. Four-week CFU change explained most variation in relapse (R2=0.90) while four-week 16S rRNA change did not (R2=0.24). CFU-16S gap is only partially explained by slow decay of residual 16S, suggesting development of a VBNCSA population.

Early identification of pathogenic LDLR variants enables prompt intervention with lipid-lowering therapies; however, the majority of LDLR variants observed in the population have uncertain or absent clinical classifications, limiting the potential to improve clinical management. Methods: We developed an innovative, activity-normalized prime editing screening pipeline to measure the impact of 5,184 LDLR coding variants on LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) uptake. Through pairing a genotypic outcome reporter with every prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA), we adjust phenotypic measurements to account for variable editing efficiency, extending activity normalization to prime editing for the first time at this scale. Further, we use a statistical estimation approach that leverages measurements for all missense variants at a given position to denoise the resulting scores. Results: We show that prime editing-mediated reporter editing correlates with endogenous variant installation frequency, allowing activity normalization to improve imputation of LDLR variant effect. Our optimized prime editing assay identifies a broad, continuous spectrum of variant functional effects. We achieve robust separation of pathogenic vs. benign ClinVar variants and concordance between experimentally derived functional scores and LDL-C levels measured in UK Biobank participants. Further, when calibrating the strength of evidence provided by this functional screening data to align with the ACMG/AMP variant interpretation guidelines, and integrating additional sources of evidence, a majority of currently unclassified rare LDLR variants meet evidence thresholds for reclassification. We use the broad coverage of this screen to gain insight into how apolipoproteins bind to LDLR. In particular, we identify and characterize rare LDLR variants that enhance LDL-C uptake through increased interaction with apolipoprotein B. Finally, we compare prime editing-based functional scores with those derived from recent base editing and cDNA-based LDLR variant screens, showing that these approaches all show robust correlation with clinically observed LDL-C levels and computational scores, while prime editing identifies candidate splice-altering coding variants that are not modeled by cDNA screening.

Using a repeated negative-stimulus paradigm, we quantified adaptation at micro (within-trial) and macro (across-session) scales via electroencephalography in 28 MD patients and 34 healthy controls, measuring both conventional event-related potentials and large-scale traveling-wave propagation. MD patients exhibited pervasive maladaptation: neural rigidity at the micro scale (absent repetition suppression) and progressive regulatory depletion at the macro scale (escalating emotional reactivity with declining cognitive control).

Previously, we applied signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) to identify genes required for V. vulnificus survival during host infection, revealing numerous loci that did not correspond to classical toxin-encoding genes. In the present study, we extended this genome-wide screen by linking STM-identified mutations to observable fitness-related phenotypes. Functional annotation revealed enrichment of genes associated with chemotaxis, flagellar motility, regulation, metabolism, and poorly characterized functions. Phenotypic analyses showed that many STM-derived mutants exhibited defects in swimming motility and altered colony surface properties. Bioluminescence imaging further revealed distinct patterns of impaired persistence and dissemination within host tissues, while several mutants displayed increased susceptibility to phagocytic stress in an HL-60-derived neutrophil model. Notably, some regulatory mutants affecting global signaling pathways exhibited impaired tissue dissemination despite retaining resistance to phagocytic stress, indicating the presence of fitness determinants that operate independently of classical surface-associated or cytotoxic traits. Together, these findings demonstrate that V. vulnificus fitness during infection depends on diverse physiological pathways beyond classical virulence factors, highlighting the value of phenotype-centered analyses for understanding bacterial adaptation in host-associated environments.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

B.; Caro-Pascual, A.; Do\u0308rsch, P.; Shapleigh, J. P.; Frostegard, A.", "abstract": "Oxygen concentrations fluctuate in soil across time and space. Under anoxic conditions, the three main microbial metabolic pathways - denitrification, fermentation, and DNRA - compete for the same carbon (C) sources. Studies on denitrification in complex soil communities often rely on incubation experiments to determine how various factors affect the regulatory biology of denitrifying organisms and their N2O emissions. These experiments typically require an exogenous C source to stimulate measurable activity, and the choice of C source is critical as it should support denitrification while minimizing competition from fermentation and DNRA. This consideration is equally important for the enrichment and isolation of diverse denitrifying organisms and for bioaugmentation-based N2O-mitigation strategies. Here, we compared twelve C sources, including glutamic acid, acetate, an artificial root exudate cocktail (eight compounds, individually and in combination), and a clover extract. By combining high-resolution denitrification gas kinetics, metagenomic sequencing, and 15N isotope labelling, we aimed to find a C source(s) that (1) supports a diverse soil-derived denitrifying community and (2) limits the competition for C from alternative anaerobic pathways. Among the tested substrates, only the clover extract supported denitrification and maintained a complex denitrifying community. Yet, it also promoted fermentation and DNRA, revealing that a trade-off must exist between fostering denitrifier diversity and limiting growth of organisms using competing anaerobic pathways. More broadly, our results highlight that C source is a methodological fulcrum in controlled soil microbiome studies. It shapes community composition, drives metabolic processes, and ultimately determines the ecological relevance of experimental outcomes and the success of enrichments and soil bioaugmentation approaches.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

This relationship presents a potential target for vector control strategies. Ivermectin (IVM), an endectocidal drug that selectively affects invertebrates while remaining safe at high concentrations in mammals and birds, can be delivered to Cx. tarsalis via blood meals from birds fed IVM-treated bird feed. In this study we evaluated the safety, efficacy, and utility of IVM-treated bird feed as a novel vector control strategy by assessing its impact on multiple bird species and mosquitoes. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected during peak WNV transmission season in Northern Colorado and DNA extracted from blood meals to determine host species. Chickens, pigeons, zebra finches, and house sparrows were fed different formulations of IVM-treated bird feed and observed for clinical signs, and their sera were fed to Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes to evaluate mosquitocidal efficacy. Feeding rates and IVM serum concentrations in birds were analyzed by unpaired t-test and one-way ANOVA, and mosquito survivorship was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using paired log-rank tests. IVM serum concentration and mosquito survivorship were compared using Spearman correlation. Results: Speciation analyses conducted on blood meals from Cx. tarsalis collected during peak WNV transmission season in Northern Colorado determined that they feed primarily on songbird species that commonly visit bird feeders, with house sparrows representing the most frequent blood meal host. In laboratory experiments using multiple formulations and doses of IVM, chickens, pigeons, zebra finches, and house sparrows ate comparable amounts of IVM-treated bird feed compared to untreated feed, had similar weight gain, and exhibited no clinical signs of toxicity. Both colony-reared and locally captured Cx. tarsalis showed significant mortality after feeding on sera from IVM-treated birds compared to controls. Conclusions: These results suggest that targeting songbirds with IVM-treated bird feed should be safe for wildlife and may elicit high rates of IVM-induced mortality by reaching a large proportion of WNV vector mosquitoes via their proclivity for feeding on passerine birds.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Our previous studies established that MAB_2362 (SteA) is a key regulator of cell division that contributes to intrinsic resistance and virulence. Considering that SteA-like proteins often act alongside SteB counterparts, we hypothesized that the adjacent gene MAB_2363 encodes the corresponding SteB-like division regulator. In this study, we found that deletion of MAB_2363 significantly increased susceptibility to multiple antibiotics and disrupted cell wall permeability. Microscopy revealed striking cell division defects in the mutant, including elongated cell morphology and multiple septa. Subcellular localization of a GFP-MAB_2363 fusion protein demonstrated its enrichment at division septa, confirming its direct involvement in cell division. Deletion of MAB_2363 resulted in attenuated virulence, as evidenced by reduced bacterial survival in macrophages and murine infection models. To assess its functional relation with MAB_2362, we compared the single-deletion mutant of MAB_2363 with the single-deletion mutant of MAB_2362 and the double-deletion mutant of MAB_2362-MAB_2363. Notably, the phenotypes of the MAB_2363 mutant, including cell division defects, antibiotic susceptibility, and virulence, were markedly milder than those of the other two mutants.

Plants and associated microbiomes have co-evolved over millennia, yet evidence for a strong influence of plant phylogeny in influencing their microbiomes is largely lacking. Our main aims was to identify key drivers of plant microbiome assembly. Methods Here, we conducted a full factorial experiment that included three levels of soil microbial diversity, five plant species from three functional groups (C3, C4, and C3 nitrogen-fixing), and two moisture availability levels. Results Our results showed that host identity and plant functional group exerted the strongest effect on leaf microbial assembly, while root and soil microbiomes showed less sensitivity to host selection. The initial soil microbial diversity and community structure significantly impacted soil and root microbial composition, but not leaf microbiomes. Importantly, we observed significant positive linkage between host phylogeny distance and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index in leaf microbiomes. This finding was further validated through analysis of microbiome data from seven plant species grown across different field and environmental conditions. Interestingly, there was no significant impact of short-term water stress on plant microbial communities. Conclusions By providing empirical evidence for important role of host selection in shaping plant microbiomes, this study advances our fundamental knowledge of plant-microbe interactions and their co-evolutionary relationships, and enhances our ability to develop future tools harnessing plant microbiome to improve plant health and productivity.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

However, how spatial partitioning governs Hog1 pathway specificity remains poorly understood. Here, we generated genetically engineered strains expressing localization-restricted Hog1 variants including membranetethered and constitutively nuclear, and we compared their phenotypic traits with those of a fully functional Hog1mCherry strain. The membrane-tethered Hog1 restored thermotolerance and antifungal resistance in the hog1 mutant, whereas nuclear Hog1 was necessary for osmotic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and for capsule and melanin biosynthesis. These localization-specific effects were corroborated by the expression profiles of genes involved in glycerol biosynthesis, under osmotic stress or fludioxonil treatment. Measurement of intracellular glycerol revealed that the plasma membrane-tethering of Hog1 caused excessive accumulation, underscoring the importance of spatiotemporal regulation of Hog1 activity Also, nuclear Hog1 uniquely reinstated osmoadaptation and conferred tunicamycin tolerance independent of canonical Ire1Hxl1 splicing, suggesting a nucleus-centric module for ER stress protection. Conversely, membrane-tethered Hog1 enhanced glycerol accumulation and restored amphotericin B resistance while increasing azole susceptibility despite normal ergosterol levels, implicating localization-biased regulation upstream of sterol abundance.

Harnessing the potential of this waste material to support the synthesis of valuable products such as hydrogen fuel or reduced graphene oxide, which may be utilized for conductive thin films and energy storage2,3, can reduce waste and add revenue streams for dairy farmers. Here, we demonstrate a circular bioeconomy using alginate-encapsulated co-cultures of Shewanella oneidensis together with lactic-acid-producing bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae. These co-cultures can directly metabolize unprocessed cheese-making waste as an electron source instead of costly, environmentally high-impact lactic acid4,5. Alginate-encapsulated co-cultures fed unprocessed dairy waste showed a 2-to-3-fold higher graphene oxide reduction rate compared to S. oneidensis monocultures with no supplemental electron source. Encapsulated co-cultures were able to be recycled for more than 30 days with no measurable decrease in graphene oxide reduction efficiency, showing compatibility with future industrial scaling. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation with cadmium selenide quantum dots as the catalyst resulted in 6-fold increases in hydrogen produced by co-cultures using milk as an electron source precursor for the system in comparison to S. oneidensis monocultures without any added electron sources.

Subsequent research has revealed the methanotrophic metabolism of Crenothrix bacteria and their disproportionately high activity in stratified lakes compared to unicellular strains, yet laboratory cultivation has proven elusive, leaving the ecophysiology of Crenothrix bacteria largely unknown. Here we report the isolation of two methanotroph strains of the \"lacustrine Crenothrix\" clade from an iron-rich wetland and reveal their highly unique cell biologies and potential ecological roles. Using physiological approaches, we demonstrate that the strains perform a microaerobic methane metabolism while growing distinct filaments having wide and directionally oriented connective structures. The strains further have broad genomic repertoires for addressing redox stress that we show are uniquely associated with lacustrine Crenothrix compared to related methanotrophs based on genome data. Aligning with laboratory observations, we identify lacustrine Crenothrix bacteria along potential redox gradients in the wetland at iron-rich snow sites, and we further detect such bacteria in diverse global ecosystems based on public metagenome searches. Together, our data strongly point to an ecophysiology of lacustrine Crenothrix bacteria that is tightly linked to redox stress, and we propose these bacteria may uniquely store or share metabolic intermediates via their filamentous lifestyle to thrive under such conditions.

We employed multiple gene assignments to identify gene function within these MAGs. A total of 1.05M genes were assigned biogeochemical functions, with BGF alone suggesting putative ecosystem roles for 0.49M (46%) of these at a confidence of 85% or greater; these genes were classified as unknown by the other approaches.

To evaluate the circulation and co-infection rates of five Anaplasma species (A. ovis, A. capra, A. bovis, A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum) in asymptomatic small ruminants in Corsica - a Mediterranean island of France - we designed a singleplex, duplex, and multiplex nested PCR (nPCR) scheme based on the gltA gene. Anaplasmosis was found to be highly endemic on the island, with 85.2% of the tested small ruminants infected by one or more Anaplasma species (82.8% of sheep and 89.5% of goats). We confirmed the presence of A. ovis and A. capra, and, for the first time in Corsica, detected A. bovis and A. phagocytophilum in both sheep (respective infection rates: 64.3%, 34.3%, 4.3%, and 7.1%) and goats (respective rates: 84.2%, 13.2%, 18.4%, and 5.3%). A. marginale was not detected. Approximately one-third of the infected animals were co-infected (35.1% of infected sheep and 32.4% of infected goats). A. ovis was always involved in co-infections, most often associated with A. capra (54.8% of co-infections). Importantly, A. bovis was never detected as a mono-infection in asymptomatic animals, but was always found associated with A. ovis (32.3% of co-infections). Sequence analysis of the gltA and 16S rRNA genes confirmed the species identification of all detected Anaplasma species. A probably new Anaplasma species was detected for the first time in Corsica using the 16S rRNA nPCR. Furthermore, we found several circulating A. phagocytophilum genetic variants. Sequence analysis of A. ovis 16S rRNA revealed a single SNP that delineates two sequence groups (Ao1goat and Ao2sheep), which were significantly linked to the host of origin. Additionally, two groups of A. bovis gltA sequences were identified (Ab1 and Ab2, with 87.4% sequence homology), forming two novel clades.

Beyond vitamin provision, transcriptomic data suggest that the microbiota also supports other key nutritional processes. Here, we explored these roles by conducting a metabolomics analysis on Aedes aegypti third instar larvae following microbiota depletion. We sampled larvae and dissected guts 12- and 20-hours post-decolonization and analysed methanol-soluble metabolites using untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal a pronounced impact of gut microbial presence on several metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the uricolytic pathway. Germ-free larvae also had a lower quantity of cholesterol in guts and their long-chain fatty acid profile was altered in guts and whole larvae. Sterols, including cholesterol, are essential precursors for the production of the moulting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. We therefore tested how supplementing exogenous cholesterol affects the development of germ-free larvae. The effects proved to be highly concentration-dependent, ranging from a marginally significant increase in successful development to adulthood at low concentrations to a pronounced developmental impairment at higher concentrations. Moreover, bacteria deficient in fatty acids beta-oxidation had a significantly lower ability to support larval development. Together, the observed alterations suggest that microbiota-deprived larvae exhibit a downregulation of metabolic processes related to energy production, nitrogen excretion and sterol metabolism, likely due to the absence of microbiota-derived vitamins essential for these central metabolic functions.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

A symptom scoring assay was developed to assess hNoV infectivity following microinjection into zebrafish embryos, being used in combination with reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), long-range RT-qPCR, and RNase-treated RT-qPCR. With a general laboratory set-up of viruses being suspended in deionized water droplets in Petri dish, UV 222 was demonstrated with comparable, if not superior, performance in reducing hNoV infectivity and RNA integrity, and was significantly more effective than UV 254 in damaging viral capsids. MS2 exhibited inactivation patterns similar to hNoVs, whereas TV was markedly more resistant to UV 222. The performance of UV 222 was consistent in inactivating hydrated viruses on both stainless steel and porcine skin surfaces. However, the efficacy of UV-222 was substantially more reduced when virus inocula were dried or mixed with simulated vomitus containing high levels of organic matter, compared with UV-254.

Location Global open ocean, with basin-specific analyses in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Time period Last Glacial Maximum (19 - 23 ka) (LGM) and the Pre-Industrial (modern) Major taxa studied Planktonic foraminifera (unicellular eukaryotes) Methods We analysed taxonomically standardized LGM and modern foraminiferal assemblage datasets to characterize changes in species richness at multiple spatial scales: global ocean, basin-wide, and within basin. We quantified species' range shifts by comparing their trailing- and leading-edge movements. We estimated temporal turnover locally, and the net imbalance between colonisations and extirpations (NICE) within sites, and tested whether species' thermal preferences correlate with their extirpation risk. Results We found no evidence of systematic trailing edge contractions, indicating that equatorial extirpations did not drive the bimodal LDG pattern. In the Atlantic, leading-edge expansions generated a coherent increase in species richness in the mid-latitudes, whereas the Pacific exhibited highly spatially heterogeneous responses, including extirpation hotspots in the western tropical Pacific and colonisation zones in the eastern and southern Pacific. Species' thermal optima weakly predicted extirpations, with species adapted to lower temperatures more at risk of extirpation, consistent with the general warming trend since the last ice age. Main conclusions The modern bimodal LDG of planktonic foraminifera arises primarily from mid-latitude colonisations rather than equatorial extirpations. Colonisations were particularly frequent in the North Atlantic. Localized extirpations in the western Pacific highlight small-scale patches of vulnerability, that spatially aggregated richness metrics mask. Our results underscore the need to distinguish between trailing and leading processes in climate-induced range shifts, and to consider spatial variability in monitoring and protection of marine biodiversity.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

By integrating generative deep-learning-based protein design with molecular-dynamics-derived flexibility descriptors, we identify a predictive relationship between interface rigidity, desolvation energy, and binding success. The resulting binder, RF1-2, reproduces the native BMP-binding epitope on GREM1 at near-atomic precision, as confirmed by cryo-electron microscopy, and competitively blocks BMP-2 and BMP-4 association.

It is for this reason that trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes have been investigated as potential targets for the development of trypanosome-killing drugs. Recent work from our lab has shown that they are also interesting biomarkers for the detection of active trypanosome infections. T. brucei enolase (TbrENO) is a trypanosomal glycolytic enzyme that has gathered interest in both drug and diagnostics development.

It has been observed that AF3 sometimes fails to capture ligand-induced conformational changes, even though it explicitly includes ligand molecules that induce such changes. To address this challenge, we develop an enhanced sampling scheme that leverages the diffusion-based generative model used in AF3 to predict protein structures. Interpreting the diffusion generative model as a stochastic sampling process analogous to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we introduce here a repulsive biasing potential between predicted structures to explore wider conformational space. We demonstrate that the developed model, AF3-ReD, successfully predicts multiple conformational states, including ligand-bound conformations of motor and transporter proteins that the original AF3 does not capture. Compared to another strategy based on multiple sequence alignment (MSA), AF3-ReD predicted intermediate conformations that are relatively closer to the stable states. Thus, AF3-ReD provides a promising approach for understanding dynamic conformational changes associated with ligand binding, including those induced by drug molecules.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

To model this process and identify associated circuit dynamics, we trained rats on a two armed bandit task with uncued reward reversals while simultaneously recording local field potentials from the circuit comprised by dorsal hippocampus (CA1d), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral performance improved with training and progressively shifted from outcome-reactive exploration to an exploitation-biased strategy, quantified using a model-free index. Mixed-effects modeling combining behavioral and neural metrics identified tonic cortical synchrony in theta and fast gamma bands as a negative session scale performance marker. Theta and gamma oscillations were coordinated, as crossregional phase amplitude coupling showed that CA1d theta phase gated fast gamma activity in PFC, while biasing both slow and fast gamma bursts in LEC, which selectively increased at goal reaching. Neuronal spiking showed crossregional phase locking to both theta and gamma rhythms, indicating synchronized timing across the hippocampo-cortical circuit. Finally, distributed neuronal spiking across the circuit represented goal approach, yet only prefrontal neurons ramped during goal-reaching, suggesting a role in outcome assessment, while hippocampal and entorhinal units transiently suppressed, consistent with locomotor tracking and resetting. These results reveal a tonic cortical connectivity marker of ongoing performance during reversal learning and dissociate it from hippocampal theta mechanisms that selectively organize cortical gamma bursts and spike timing. Together, these results provide mechanistic insight into how frequency specific hippocampocortical interactions dynamically reconfigure to support strategy transitions, offering a circuit-level framework for understanding adaptive decision making under uncertainty.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

We used acute and organotypic slices from the mouse brain and peritumoral cortex of patients with HGGs. We found that human peritumoral tissue from cortical resection was characterized by high levels of the astrocytic Connex-in43 protein (Cx43) and discrete infiltration of microglia. In contrast, the tu-mor core exhibited high myeloid infiltration and an altered extracellular ma-trix (ECM) composition, which was poor in CD44. We tracked mouse and primary human-labeled-GBM cells in 2D cultures and in co-culture with or-ganotypic slices generated from mouse brain and human peritumoral tissues. We found that the implanted GBM cells infiltrated the brain tissue, implying early glial modifications including an increase in Cx43 expression and distri-bution. Furthermore, the blockage of Cx43 hemichannels was accompanied by morphological changes and polarization of human GBM cells, typical for migration phenomena. The present study sheds light on the dynamics of GBM cells spreading in the living brain tissue, suggesting that the progression of the tumor correlates with changes within the host brain.

However, how glutamine is mechanistically supplied to the cells in the neurogenic niches and its broader impact on neurodevelopment, remain poorly characterized. The Solute carrier family 38 member 1 (Slc38a1) exhibits high affinity for glutamine and accumulates glutamine in select cells. We investigated whether Slc38a1 is essential for neurogenesis and whether it has an impact on brain structure and function. Slc38a1 mRNA transcript and protein are widely expressed in the embryonic brain, including in the dorsal pallium and sub-pallium. At embryonic day 15.5, Slc38a1 localizes in neuronal stem cells in the ventricular zone in the forebrain, while it localizes in mature neurons in the sub-ventricular zone of the hindbrain. In the adult brain, Slc38a1 is not detected in neuronal stem cells in the sub-granular zone, however, it is highly enriched in mature local parvalbumin+ and somatostatin+ interneurons and ependyma. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data further reveal that both the number of Slc38a1-expressing cells and the average transcript level of Slc38a1 are significantly higher in embryo brain cells compared to adults. In the embryo, Slc38a1 transcripts are particularly enriched in immature neuronal lineages and embryonic oligodendrocyte precursor populations, whereas in the adult, expression is more prominent in neural progenitor cells and radial glia. Disruption of Slc38a1 in mice impacts body weight, brain size and glutamatergic neuronal volume, while dendritic arborization is diminished and cellular life span is shortened. Altogether, Slc38a1 is essential for normal neurodevelopment, indirectly regulates adult neurogenesis in the sub-granular zone and influence neuronal morphology and cell viability.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we explored the overall impact of CD5L in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Using experimental RA models, we demonstrated an early surge of CD5L expression in wild-type mice, as well as a higher incidence and increased severity of arthritis in CD5L-deficient mice. In the blood, CD5L-deficient mice exhibited enhanced inflammation, a higher proportion of CD11b+ mononuclear cells, and elevated levels of IL-1beta, IL-17, and IFN-gamma;, particularly at the pre-clinical stage of arthritis. In human RA, mononuclear cells conditioned with CD5L, as well as endogenous CD5L production, were associated with reduced CD11b expression, increased IL-10 and PD-L1 production, and an enrichment of non-classical CD16+ monocytes. Analysis of the CD5L-dependent transcriptome in CD14 cells from RA patients revealed the acquisition of an efferocytosis profile, with upregulation of C1Q subunits, GAS6, AXL, and ALOX15B. It also showed signs of insufficient cargo processing, which dampens the resolution of inflammation, permits the expansion of IFN-primed non-classical monocytes, and correlates strongly with joint damage accrual. Despite markedly low CD5L levels in the synovium, RA synovial tissue was enriched with non-classical monocytes carrying the GAS6-AXL signature, which fosters osteoclast progenitors. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the anti-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving properties of CD5L in experimental and human RA are mediated through the induction of efferocytosis-related and IFN-primed monocyte programs. This harbors a potential risk of uncontrolled invasion of non-classical monocytes into the synovial tissue, leading to joint structural damage. The complex role of CD5L in inflammation and disease outcomes requires careful consideration of the disease phase and experimental context.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

MSMEG_1353 depletion increased cell width and volume, delayed log-phase initiation, slowed aggregation, reduced biofilm formation, and heightened susceptibility to antibiotics and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). AlphaFold, sequence alignment, and UNIPROT analyses suggest MSMEG_1353 functions as a protein kinase, with conserved residues in intermediate high-confidence regions potentially forming an ATP-binding site.

Notably, a strong negative correlation with MSMEG_0911, the predominant isocitrate lyase, important in the glyoxylate cycle, was observed via both MS and RT-qPCR.

The drivers and dynamics of AMR propagation along river systems remain poorly understood. As Switzerland's longest and one of its largest rivers, the Aare, situated in the upper Rhine watershed, plays a central role in the 'water castle of Europe'.

Concentrations of trace metals and nutrients were analyzed as tracers of anthropogenic inputs. Results revealed a progressive increase in ARG abundance downstream, driven by WWTP effluents enriched in ARGs. Effluents had 70-fold higher mean ARG concentrations than upstream waters, raising downstream levels up to 141-fold. Major tributaries such as the Reuss and Limmat sustained elevated ARG levels, while passage through lakes markedly reduced concentrations.

Detecting genomic traces of RNA viruses in older, buried remains is generally considered highly unlikely. The cold, dry conditions of Antarctica may represent an exception. Under such circumstances, natural mummification of penguins and seals - animals that form large colonies where RNA viruses circulate - is common and may facilitate the recovery of RNA virus genomes. Here, we show that Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) mummies, ranging in age from recent to nearly two millennia, indeed contain fragments of such ancient viral genomes. Metatranscriptomic analyses yielded near-complete genome sequences of a picornavirus (Megrivirus epengu) and a rotavirus D (Rotavirus deltagastroenteritidis) from relatively recent specimens. We further retrieved rotavirus D sequences from a 280-year-old individual and a near-complete rotavirus G (Rotavirus gammagastroenteritidis) genome from a 1900-year-old one. These findings pave the way to direct studies of RNA virus evolution across millennia.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

The Lsm2-8 complex is involved in the nuclear maturation of spliceosomal U6 snRNA, whereas the Lsm1-7/Pat1 complex associates with mRNA decapping complexes in the cytoplasm. A proposed role of Lsm1-7 is to recruit the decapping machinery to unstable mRNA that are rapidly deadenylated. However, the impact of deadenylation on RNA stability has been challenged by recent studies in yeast and other organisms. To investigate the dynamics of the Lsm1-7 in recruiting the decapping enzyme Dcp2 we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) combined with affinity purifications and mass spectrometry for Lsm1 and Dcp1. These experiments identified a slow dynamics of protein exchange between Dcp2 or Pby1 when bound by Dcp1 and a similarly slow exchange between the Lsm components of the Lsm1-7 complex, with faster exchange rates for other components of these complexes. To evaluate the potential role of Lsm1 in the degradation of unstable transcripts, we investigated the effects on mRNA of a rapid depletion of Lsm1 in an inducible degron system. Lsm1 depletion led to an increase in the abundance of transcripts that have been previously identified as stablised in the absence of LSM1. However, depletion of Lsm1 also led to a modest increase in the levels of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) substrates, similar to the expected results of a minor decapping defect. Altogether, our results suggest that Lsm1-7 is required for the normal function of the decapping complex on specific transcripts, including NMD substrates, although its impact on RNA degradation, in particular for unstable mRNA, is very limited.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

We used cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of Ty1 VLPs purified from a Ty1-less yeast strain expressing a functional Ty1 element to determine the organization and interactions of Gag in Ty1 VLPs. Using sub-tomogram averaging (STA), we observed unique capsomere structures and obtained EM density maps for pentagonal (7.5 Angstrom) and hexagonal (7.9 Angstrom) capsomeres. Through iterative rounds of alignment and classification, we demonstrate that Ty1 VLPs are composed of diverse arrangements of capsomeres, unlike true icosahedral virions. We modeled the structure of the conserved Ty1 Gag capsid C-terminal domain (CA-CTD), previously determined using X-ray crystallography into the capsomeric arrangements, and identified roles for the Dimer-1 interface present in the asymmetric unit, as well as additional interfaces involved in intra- and inter-capsomere assembly. We show that pentagonal or hexagonal capsomere assembly results from flexibility of CA-CTD to CA-CTD interactions at Interface-2. Additionally, we determined the structure of the Ty1 Gag capsid N-terminal domain (CA-NTD) using solution NMR and fitted the CA-NTD into the cryo-ET density maps. Our results indicate that the heterogeneous population of VLP size and morphology arises, at least in part, from the ability of the capsomeres to assemble in diverse organizations.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Dynamic stiffening due to the fluid-gel transition during collagen polymerization and chemical crosslinking using glutaraldehyde was tracked by shear waves speed (SWS) at vibration frequencies between 3 and 10 kHz and frame rates up to 4 kHz. During collagen polymerization, after an initial lag phase, SWS increased on average 6 {+/-} 3 min earlier than optical density, suggesting that a load-bearing percolating fiber network was established before fibril thickening enhanced light scattering.

To investigate regulatory mechanisms in Aqp2 gene transcription, we engineered an Aqp2 reporter cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 to insert a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette at the endogenous Aqp2 gene locus in mpkCCD cells. In the absence of dDAVP, a vasopressin analog, these cells exhibited low or undetectable GFP and Aqp2 expression in all cells. dDAVP stimulation (1nM dDAVP for 48hrs) markedly increased both GFP and Aqp2 expression together with reversal upon dDAVP removal. These observations demonstrate that GFP faithfully tracks Aqp2 expression. Interestingly, fewer than 50% of cells express GFP and Aqp2 after dDAVP or forskolin, indicating significant variability even though they were clonally-derived. We flow-sorted the GFP- cells (Aqp2-) and GFP+ cells (Aqp2+), regrew them, and restimulated them separately with dDAVP. Cells originating from GFP- cells gave rise to both GFP- cells and GFP+ cells, and GFP+ cells similarly regenerated both GFP- and GFP+ populations in the same proportion. Flow cytometry analysis of the DNA content showed variability in cell cycle phases, with most GFP+ cells in G0/G1, and more GFP- cells in G2/S. RNA-seq analysis of the GFP- and GFP+ cells revealed increased abundance of cell-cycle related transcripts in the GFP- cells.

Objective: To test whether dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) dwell-time patterns from resting-state fMRI differ by AD genetic risk in cognitively healthy, middle-aged adults. Methods: We estimated recurring dFC clusters from rs-fMRI and computed dwell-time (total time spent in each cluster) for individuals in not-at-risk, A+P-, and A+P+ groups. Group differences in dwell-time profiles were assessed, and logistic regression with permutation testing evaluated the association between dwell-time features and genotype. Results: At-risk groups (A+P-, A+P+) spent less time in left-hemisphere hubs than not-at-risk individuals, consistent with reports of left-hemisphere vulnerability in AD. Logistic regression showed modest above-chance genotype discrimination, with permutation tests indicating a marginal trend when comparing not-at-risk versus at-risk (A+P-, A+P+) groups.

By combining a literature review with a meta-analysis of ~44,000 fungal metabarcoding samples from the GlobalFungi database, we show that yeasts occur in over 90% of samples, confirming their global ubiquity. Basidiomycetous lineages-especially Agaricomycotina-were most frequently detected, whereas Saccharomycotina were more restricted to anthropogenic and aquatic settings. Although yeasts typically comprised only ~0.1% of fungal reads, their distributions were non-random and reflected distinct habitat preferences across environments. In ~3% of samples, yeasts exceeded 25% of reads, with genera such as Aureobasidium, Hanseniaspora, and Saccharomyces episodically dominating nutrient-rich or human-influenced environments. Cosmopolitan genera including Vishniacozyma, Solicoccozyma, and Rhodotorula were broadly distributed but remain underreported in microbiome surveys. Shotgun metagenomic data further confirmed yeast presence across diverse microbiomes, though with consistently low coverage, reflecting the \"curse of low abundance.\" Despite their rarity, yeasts likely play disproportionate roles in nutrient cycling, plant growth, and host interactions.

Using a combination of chemical characterization, ultrastructural and compositional analyses, and phylogenetic and genomic insights into microbial assemblages, we investigated the influence of geochemical parameters on the diversity, ecophysiology, and distribution of MTB in freshwater and brackish sediments. Special focus is given to intracellular inclusions and their metabolic pathways to uncover functional traits and ecological roles in elemental cycling. Of the 118 examined MTB cells, polyphosphate granules (75%) and nitrate-containing vacuoles (67%) were the most common inclusions followed by sulfur globules (25%) and calcium carbonate granules (8%).

The ubiquitous nature and important ecological role of MTB can be explained by their ability to sequester chemical elements into intracellular inclusions, giving them a metabolic advantage in dynamic chemically stratified environments.

In this study, we collected urine from subjects prior to prostate biopsy and applied a novel Human Sterolbiome Discovery High-throughput (HSDH) assay to identify culturable urinary bacteria with the ability to generate androgens. Application of the HSDH assay to urine samples led to the isolation of eight P. lymphophilum strains positive for cortisol side-chain cleavage (steroid-17,20-desmolase), 17{beta}-HSDH activity, or both. In addition, we isolated three strains of Actinobaculum massiliense that encode DHEA isomerase reductase (dir) genes.

Here, we evaluate whether commonly observed biogeographical patterns apply to microbial biodiversity in pond fungal and bacterial communities. Specifically, we tested (1) whether these communities follow latitudinal diversity gradients and distance decay relationships, and (2) if variation in community composition or richness was related to specific environmental or land-use factors. [bullet] Location: Eastern, USA [bullet] Time period: Summer, 2022 [bullet] Taxa: Bacteria and Fungi [bullet] Methods: We collected water and muck from 39 ponds across 8 states in the Eastern USA. We extracted DNA from these samples and sequenced sections of the 16S rRNA and ITS1 genes to survey the bacterial and fungal communities, before evaluating biogeographical patterns. [bullet] Results: We found evidence of latitudinal diversity gradients in muck fungal communities, but not bacterial communities. We observed weak distance decay relationships in all sample types. Community richness was related to some environmental filters, where conductivity was positively related to water bacterial richness, but negatively related to muck fungal richness.

A central goal of biogeography is to partition the world's biota into meaningful biogeographical regions. While naturalists have long delineated biogeographic regions using hierarchical hard clustering approaches, they have often acknowledged the existence of transition zones. However, such transition zones have not been empirically identified or distinguished from hard clusters. Transition zones are outstanding areas for understanding the processes that shape biotic assembly; however, a coherent framework for delineating them is lacking. 2. Here, we propose a framework to empirically identify and analyze transition zones through a new metric, the \"Transition Zone Index (TZI)\". The TZI decomposes the proportional contribution of multiple biotas to a spatial unit (called a map cell) derived from a Grade of Membership model into a single quantitative measure per cell using Shannon entropy principles. The transition zones can then be quantified and presented as a gradient, scaled from TZI = 0 (indicating distinctive bioregions) to TZI = 1 (corresponding to the highly transitional areas with maximally admixed biotas). Finally, we implement spatial regression models to detect the predictors of these transition zones. 3. We demonstrate the application of our framework using vascular plants of southern Africa. Through the spatial variation of TZI, our approach represents transition zones as a continuous gradient of biotic turnover between bioregions. These transition zones were found to be either previously delineated as discrete clusters or incorporated into neighboring clusters. Our approach effectively captures both the intensity and width of transitional dynamics, showing that these patterns are primarily shaped by precipitation. 4. Biogeographic transition zones are a measurable gradient, and our framework provides a robust quantitative foundation for detecting and analyzing the drivers of these areas. This improves our ability to understand the patterns and processes underlying biogeographic transition and provides important implications for conservation planning and biodiversity management.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Whether these defects arise cell-autonomously, rather than secondarily to neural dysfunction, and which developmental windows are most vulnerable to MeCP2 disfunction remains unresolved. MeCP2 is a dosage-sensitive transcriptional regulator, whose functions are tightly linked to chromatin states. Because short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are known to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), a tractable in vivo model is needed to test the effect of HDAC modulation on muscle defects. Methods We misexpressed human MECP2 in the Drosophila melanogaster mesoderm that gives rise to skeletal and visceral muscles. We analyzed quantitatively their morphology and function. To assess the effects of SCFA supplementation, we also supplemented diets with sodium butyrate (NaB), Lalbaay, a NaB-containing supplement, acetate (AcOH), and valproate (VPA). Findings MECP2 misexpression caused pre-eclosion lethality, thinning of larval skeletal fibers with nuclear mispositioning and altered mitochondria. Functionally, it reduced locomotion, decreased food transit and gut peristalsis. Phenotypes were strongest when expression began during development. NaB and VPA supplementation rescue most of these phenotypes, consistent with their histone- deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Defects were not observed upon comparable misexpression of an RTT-associated MeCP2 loss-of-function variant, indicating that they might be relevant to pathogenesis of MECP2-related disorders.

Risk describes lotteries with well defined probabilities, whereas ambiguity describes cases where probabilities are not known.

This relationship, known as ambiguity aversion, holds even when both options have the same quantitative levels of uncertainty. Despite the prevalence of ambiguity in the natural world, the psychological and neural mechanisms that produce ambiguity aversion are not well understood. Here, we developed a nonhuman primate task to study ambiguity attitudes in the lab. We showed that the animals are strongly ambiguity averse, even when they could learn the true values of the ambiguous options through repeated trials. Then, to understand why they were ambiguity averse, we examined points of subjective equivalence between risky gambles and ambiguous alternatives. These experiments demonstrated that when the potential outcomes were large, the animals judged the probability of getting the better outcome far below the true probability of 0.5. Interestingly, we observed the opposite in small value gambles: the animals were overly optimistic about their chances of getting the better reward, even though the true probability was still 0.5. These inconsistent judgments about probabilities suggest that the animals do not hold consistent beliefs, and that the lack of consistent beliefs leads to suboptimal economic outcomes.

A recent study has shown that human IDRs with different levels of compactness, as measured by Florys exponent, are associated with specific cellular functions and localizations, and Florys exponent can be predicted from sequence features with reasonable accuracy. However, IDRs are known to sample highly heterogenous conformations that can be masked by ensemble-averaged metrics such as Florys exponent. Here, we introduce a simple framework that resolves heterogeneous conformations. We pair two polymer physics descriptors, shape ratio (Rs) and relative shape anisotropy (RSA), to construct joint two-dimensional (RSA, Rs) maps at both the global and local (subchain) scales. We show that sequences with similar Florys exponent can display strikingly different two-dimensional conformational maps that reflect differences in charge patterning. IDRs with similar global maps can exhibit markedly different local maps that can be linked to local sequence variations. This leads to the identification of a class of IDRs that appear non-compact globally but contain locally compact subchains. These locally compact IDRs are found to be associated with similar GO functional and cellular localization enrichments and phase-separation propensities as globally compact IDRs.

As established previously, this coupling requires formation of liquid-ordered (Lo)-like regions (aka rafts) around the nano-clustered receptors to facilitate lipid-based partitioning of Lyn via its membrane anchor, followed by receptor phosphorylation mediated by protein-protein interactions. Imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (ImFCS) was previously used to measure diffusion of Lyn-EGFP and its lipid anchor PM-EGFP (both Lo-preferring) as well as EGFP-GG (inner leaflet lipid probe, liquid-disordered (Ld)-preferring) and showed that the membrane reorganized within 15 minutes after Ag addition. To quantify the transition kinetics between the resting and Ag-stimulated steady-states, we have now developed Boxcar ImFCS for time-resolved diffusion measurements on sub-minute scale. We found that Ag stimulation causes gradual diffusion decreases for Lyn-EGFP and PM-EGFP with distinctive half-times (t_1/2) of 6.9 min and 12 min, respectively, showing that protein-based interactions of Lyn accelerate its diffusional transition. Simultaneously, EGFP-GG gradually changes to faster diffusion with t_1/2 = 9.4 min. In comparison, t_1/2 = 5.0 min for recruitment of cytoplasmic Syk by phosphorylated Fc{epsilon}RI, consistent with initiation of transmembrane signaling before global membrane reorganization and raft condensation is completed by large, stabilized Ag-IgE-Fc{epsilon}RI clusters.

Here, we identify the oxysterol 25_hydroxycholesterol (25_HC) as a pathogenic lipid downstream of the cGAS_STING_IFN pathway. In models of tau pathology, interferon signaling induces Cholesterol 25_hydroxylase (CH25H) expression in microglia. Ch25h deletion in female P301S mice suppressed tau aggregation, preserved synapses, prevented brain atrophy, and rescued memory. Mechanistically, loss of CH25H disrupted STING trafficking, attenuated IFN activation, dampened self-perpetuating microglial inflammation. Strikingly, 25_HC directly accelerated tau propagation in human iPSC derived neurons. It also disrupted lysosomal and mitochondrial lipid composition, driving cholesteryl ester accumulation and promoting apoptosis under tau-induced stress. These findings define a STING_IFN_CH25H lipid axis that bridges innate immune activation to tau pathology and toxicity, offering a tractable therapeutic pathway for inflammation-driven neurodegenerative conditions.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

B.; Mysore, S. P.", "abstract": "Competitive stimulus interactions across the space map in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) are essential for spatial decision-making. Here, with electrophysiological recordings in intermediate and deep layers of the mouse SC (SCid), we discovered that rules and the spatial profiles of these competitive interactions are different between local, within-RF versus global, across-RF-boundary spatial scales. When one visual stimulus was centered in the receptive field (RF) and a second one was located within the RF's classical inhibitory surround, we found that stimulus interactions followed an averaging rule. This classical surround was spatially restricted, and the strength of inhibition underlying these 'within-RF' interactions decreased with distance from the RF center. By contrast, when the second stimulus was located outside the RF, stimulus interactions followed a divisive rule. Strikingly, this extra-classical inhibitory surround was spatially global, and the strength of competitive inhibition underlying these 'across-RF-boundary' interactions was distance-invariant. Computational modeling revealed that whereas within-RF interactions are well-explained by a divisive normalization-like mechanism driven by pooled inhibition, across-RF-boundary interactions are not, and instead, are well-explained by a winner-take-all-like mechanism driven by structured, donut-like inhibition. Combined, our results offer insights into the mechanistic logic of stimulus competition in the SCid, which critically underlies spatial decision-making in mammals.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Clusterin (CLU) is a chaperone protein known to protect both normal and malignant cells, from metabolic stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we investigated whether overexpression (OE) of CLU in TCRtg T cells and CAR-T cells respectively can reduce exhaustion induced by chronic antigen stimulation and enhance T cell functionality against Ewing sarcoma (EwS). Among other cytoprotective genes, we found that CLU was significantly downregulated in dysfunctional tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Therefore, we engineered EwS-directed TCRtg T cells targeting a Chondromodulin-1 (Chm1)-derived peptide and GD2 CAR-T cells to overexpress CLU. We show here that CLU is downregulated in T cells following activation by tumor cells. CLU-overexpressing T cells exhibit decreased expression of exhaustion markers (PD1, LAG3) and reduced apoptosis after repetitive stimulation. These cells demonstrated improved infiltration into tumor spheroids and maintained functionality under hypoxic conditions. In vivo, CLU-overexpressing T cells showed enhanced persistence and a trend towards reduced tumor growth. Mechanistically, proteomic analysis suggested that reduced ribosomal activity might delay T cell exhaustion, implicating metabolic reprogramming. In conclusion, CLU OE in tg T cells enhances their persistence and functionality by mitigating exhaustion, possibly through modulation of ribosomal activity and metabolic pathways. This strategy holds potential for improving adoptive T cell therapies against solid tumors.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

The placenta is the key transient organ in pregnancy that directs nutrient transfer, intermediary metabolism and the production of hormones that drive maternal metabolic adaptations essential for pregnancy and lactation. The exchange surface of the placenta is formed in early development by the interaction between trophoblast cells that enclose the maternal blood and extraembryonic mesodermal cells that comprise the fetal vasculature. Despite recent insights into trophoblast development derived from novel in-vitro approaches, the processes driving extraembryonic mesoderm development are not well explored. This is due to a dearth of studies employing unbiased approaches to interrogate extraembryonic mesoderm cell populations. Here we use genetic labelling techniques to separate molecular events occurring in the trophoblast from those in the mesodermal layers of the placenta. In combination with conditional targeting, we show that the imprinted gene Dlk1 is a key player in providing nutrients to the embryo by controlling the placental surface area available for nutrient exchange, and by modulating the production of placental hormones that promote maternal nutrient provision in pregnancy.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate spatial sorting and countergradient selection as evolutionary mechanisms contributing to range expansion. We focus on the rapid range expansion of a fiddler crab (Minuca pugnax) in the Gulf of Maine, an ocean warming hotspot. We use common garden experiments to quantify change in pelagic larval duration (PLD), a key determinant of dispersal ability, across edge and interior core populations, and between timepoints separated by 19 years. Consistent with spatial sorting, larvae from poleward, edge populations had shorter PLDs relative to equatorward, core populations, which is more dispersive in this system because it is characterized by equatorward flows. Compared to 19 years prior, PLDs were significantly shorter, consistent with genetic change over time. Analysis of sea surface temperatures reveal that the larval development window in the edge populations has doubled over the past twenty years, suggesting the combined influence of ocean warming, trait differentiation over time, and spatial sorting in promoting range expansion. While spatial sorting is known to aid in terrestrial range expansions, our results are the first to suggest that this process might be important in the coastal oceans.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

While conventional interventions such as insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying and antimalarial drugs have reduced transmission, progress has stalled due to the limitations of these interventions and the emergence of resistance. Gene drive-modified mosquitoes represent a promising, potentially transformative vector control strategy, capable of spreading malaria-refractory traits or suppressing mosquito populations. Successful field deployment will depend upon monitoring systems to track the presence and frequency of gene drive constructs as they spread and persist. Current molecular surveillance techniques, though effective, are resource-intensive and reliant on laboratory infrastructure and technical competencies. Here, we make the case for a near-universal and low-cost rapid diagnostic test (RDT) designed to detect gene drive mosquitoes in the field, to complement existing surveillance infrastructure. Two use cases are outlined: i) to detect the presence of the drive construct in a new population, and ii) to provide an estimate of drive frequency prior to more accurate laboratory-based measurements. We provide a target product profile for the RDT outlining minimally essential and ideal characteristics, including test procedures, sensitivity, specificity, usability by a range of stakeholders in field settings, and compatibility with pooled testing of mosquito samples. An RDT for gene drive construct detection would support community access and participation in monitoring, enhance regulatory oversight, and promote transparency in field trials, thereby facilitating responsible deployment of gene drive-based malaria interventions.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

Methods: We analyzed fecal microbiota via 16S rRNA V4 sequencing and quantified stool IgA, breastmilk components (antibodies, metabolic hormones, macronutrients) using ELISA and standard biochemical methods. Results: PCoA showed separation by delivery mode (PCo1:44.6%, PCo2:14.2%).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), DDR2 expression and activity are significantly upregulated. While collagens, the endogenous ligands of DDR2, either remain unchanged or are downregulated in AD-like conditions, Amyloid-beta 42(A{beta}42) has been found to activate DDR2 in the absence of collagen non-canonically. Additionally, DDR2 naturally translocates to the nucleus in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, and the pool of DDR2 increases further in the nucleus in the presence of A{beta}42, suggesting its novel pathological role in AD. The E113K mutant of DDR2, where the collagen-binding site has been compromised, fails to get activated by collagen, whereas A{beta}42 could still activate it. Furthermore, the DDR2 inhibitor WRG-28 effectively inhibits A{beta}42 induced phosphorylation of the protein. We have also modeled in silico the ectodomain of DDR2, extending through the transmembrane helix, and subsequently docked A{beta}42 pentamer to elucidate the mechanistic basis of kinase activation by amyloid A{beta}. Additionally, we analyzed WRG-28 binding by constructing the ternary complex of DDR2, A{beta}42, and WRG-28.

Participants performed a sequence recall task in which participants were presented with two competing syllable sequences coming from different spatial directions and were asked to report the syllable sequence coming from the target direction. On half of the trials, an unpredictable, novel interrupting sound occurred, disrupting attentional focus. Two experiments explored how talker influenced performance, specifically, whether 1) making the two streams come from different talkers facilitates task performance and reduces the impact of interruption compared to when the streams are spoken by the same talker, and 2) talker discontinuity interferes with attention buildup and harms syllable recall performance compared to when the talker is the same from one syllable to the next.

Investigating structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder, a condition marked by dysconnectivity, may elucidate underlying neural mechanisms. We examined regional structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder and its genetic underpinnings to characterize network-level disruptions. Methods: Regional structure-function coupling was estimated in UK Biobank participants using edge-wise regression between measures of structural connectivity and functional connectivity. Bipolar disorder (n=163) and controls (n=326) were age and sex-matched and compared using general linear models. To explore the genetic basis of these structure-function coupling alterations, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted in an independent UK Biobank sample (n=38,190) for regions showing significant group differences. Results: Structure-function coupling demonstrated a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient with highest coupling evident in visual regions (R^2=0.29) and lowest in the insula (R^2=0.03). The Bipolar disorder group showed higher structure-function coupling in the temporal pole and superior frontal gyrus (beta=0.269; beta=0.211) and lower coupling in the supramarginal, precentral, and postcentral gyri and the frontal pole (beta=-0.206 to -0.275). GWAS identified seven significant loci, with mapped genes (e.g., KAT6B, INPP5A, PLCE1) involved in neuronal development and cellular signaling. Conclusion: Bipolar disorder showed altered structure-function coupling across regions implicating multiple networks. These alterations suggest stronger structure-function alignment in limbic and attention networks and weaker alignment in sensorimotor, executive, frontoparietal, and salience regions relative to controls, potentially disrupting flexible polysynaptic communication. Altered coupling may relate to genetic variation affecting neurodevelopment, neuronal signaling, and synaptic plasticity.

By integrating quantitative data of microtubule dynamics and distributions into a newly developed biophysical model of microtubules across developmental stages, we uncover that MT-RF interacts with microtubule stability and nucleation. Without MT-RF slowdown, this interaction suppresses development and maintenance of axonal and dendritic microtubule arrays. In axons, MT-RF slowdown enables microtubules to reach the tip, even at long distances, supporting axon growth. In dendrites, late MT-RF slowdown facilitates an efficient increase in stable microtubules.

Using simultaneous resting-state functional FDG-PET and BOLD fMRI in 78 healthy adults (20 to 86 years), we quantified brain metabolic and haemodynamic variability, complexity, and dynamic network connectivity. Individuals with greater variability and complexity of glucose metabolism demonstrated a broader repertoire of network states, marked by globally connected and influential central hubs. Individuals who achieved a broader range of network states had better cognitive performance. In older adults, widespread reductions in dynamic metabolic connectivity were observed. Glucodynamic parameters predicted age and cognitive performance more robustly than haemodynamic measures.

In Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), differences in visual segmentation and integration are widely documented. However, existing paradigms often rely on simplified stimuli and do not capture the dynamic, naturalistic processes underlying real world scene segmentation. To overcome those limitations, in this work we present a novel, multimodal experimental framework. The framework combines precisely timed, trial-based perceptual measurements with electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how neural activity aligns temporally with segmentation decisions and with eye-tracking to examine visual exploration strategies and attention allocation. Neurotypical (NT) participants and participants with ASD aged 16 years and above viewed natural scenes and textures and indicated whether two cued image regions belonged to the same or different perceptual segments. Responses to multiple pairs of cues enabled the estimation of subjectively perceived segmentation maps and the associated uncertainty. Across NT and ASD populations, we analyzed segmentation maps, reaction time distributions, gaze profiles, and trial-aligned neural responses. Behavioral results revealed slower and more idiosyncratic segmentation patterns in ASD. Eye-tracking analyses also demonstrated distinct gaze patterns suggesting broader exploration of the images during early viewing. EEG analyses demonstrated delayed & more diffuse occipital activation in ASD, accompanied by reduced global field power at several key time windows spanning stimulus presentation. Together, these findings establish a reproducible method for studying the temporal and spatial components of natural scene segmentation and indicate meaningful behavioral and neural distinctions in ASD. This framework provides a methodological bridge between controlled experimental stimuli and real-world perception in both neurotypical and neurodivergent populations.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

These methods are particularly useful for fitting complex models, as they can bypass the need to compute an exact likelihood function, instead relying on comparisons between observed and simulated summary statistics. However, numerous technical and practical hurdles often hinder the application of these methods to new modeling problems. They require the integration of disparate scripts and software for simulation, computing summary statistics, and inference into pipelines which have to be tailor-made for each specific research project. Moreover, computational costs of population genetic simulations can make inference laborious due to costly file format conversions throughout the entire procedure. Here we present a new R package called demografr (github.com/bodkan/demografr), which aims to alleviate most issues with traditional simulation-based inference workflows while facilitating their application to novel and complex modeling problems. First, demografr leverages the R simulation toolkit slendr for interactive, user-friendly encoding of complex demographic models. Second, demografr allows the user to set up parameter distributions and run simulations from them automatically, with built-in support for parallelization. For this purpose, automated inference routines for ABC or grid-based parameter exploration are provided, with individual components available for developing other simulation-based workflows in the future. Third, demografr allows a wide range of summary statistics to be efficiently computed directly in R, without any need for file conversion. In addition to the default slendr simulation engine, demografr also supports user-defined msprime and SLiM simulation scripts as well as entirely customizable summary statistic functions. We illustrate the features of demografr on examples which would traditionally require complex workflows with hundreds of lines of code: estimating parameters of a demographic model via coalescent simulations using ABC, exploring the influence of a set of parameters on summary statistics of interest using parameter grid search, and showcasing the ability to integrate fully customized simulation code written in pure Python or SLiM.", "date": "2025-12-18", "journal": ""}

In vitro GC treatment was applied to each cell type, with transcriptomic profiling (total RNA-seq and small RNA-seq) at 2 and 6 hours post-treatment. We identified over 2,000 GC-responsive non-coding transcripts, including 654 annotated lncRNAs, 1,376 novel lncRNAs, and 39 miRNAs. The non-coding RNA response to GCs was highly cell type-dependent: 80% of GC-responsive lncRNAs and 97% of miRNAs were unique to a single cell type. Hematopoietic cells exhibited a greater magnitude of lncRNA induction than non-hematopoietic cells. Notably, dozens of facultative lncRNAs (undetectable at baseline) were induced de novo by GC. GC-responsive transcripts spanned diverse lncRNA classes, with enrichment of host lncRNAs. By contrast, only a limited number of miRNAs were GC-responsive. GC regulation of transcript abundance for miRNAs and their host lncRNAs appears to be independent. Our results, which are accessible through an interactive web application, establish a framework for studying how non-coding transcription contributes to physiological and clinical heterogeneity in GC responses.

Prior to scanning, implicit memory was induced through a standard behavioral task where participants detected regular patterns embedded in random tone sequences. Unbeknownst to participants, five regular patterns reoccurred sporadically (every 1.5 min) across trials. Consistent with previous reports, behavioral performance indicated a reaction time advantage to reoccurring patterns, confirming the formation of implicit memory traces. During passive listening in the scanner, regularity engaged the superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, putamen, and hippocampus, a result we interpret as reflecting the higher perceptual precision of regular patterns. Reoccurrence interacted with regularity in the superior temporal gyrus and a frontal cluster, showing higher activity for reoccurring compared to novel regular patterns. The hippocampus showed sensitivity to reoccurrence in both regular and random patterns.
