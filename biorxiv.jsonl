By inhibiting succinate-related metabolism, itaconate exerts antimicrobial properties at the expense of potentially disrupting the hosts own central energy metabolism, a double-edged dilemma of immunometabolism. To explore the evolutionary logic of itaconate biosynthesis, we investigated the evolutionary trajectory of IRG1, which encodes for cis-aconitate decarboxylase (CAD), the enzyme responsible for itaconate production. Phylogenetic analysis reveals a putative independent acquisition of metazoan and fungal IRG1 from prokaryotic sources. In metazoans, IRG1 underwent gene duplication and subsequently lost the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), relocating CAD outside the mitochondrial matrix and therefore preventing direct inhibition of energy metabolism. In basal metazoans that contain IRG1, oysters and amphioxus, primitive IRG1 expression is also induced by innate immune stimuli, suggesting an already specialized role of itaconate for innate immune defense in early bilaterians. Our integrated in silico and experimental analysis highlight the molecular adaptations in IRG1, including subcellular relocation, that optimize itaconate production for innate immunity in resolving a fundamental trade-off in immunometabolism.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Two-photon calcium imaging revealed that auditory cortex (ACx) SOM interneurons exhibit not only frequency-selective responses but also selectivity to categorical choices. Simultaneous optogenetic inactivation and two-photon imaging revealed that SOM interneurons refine the frequency discriminability of auditory cortical neurons and contribute to their selectivity to the categorical decision boundary. Moreover, bilateral chemogenetic inactivation of ACx SOM interneurons impaired behavior-level perceptual categorization. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding on the functional significance of SOM interneurons in auditory cortical processing and perceptual categorization, linking cell-type specific cortical circuit computations with perceptual functions.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Although the labile intermediates and chemical reaction steps have been characterized, how CTPS coordinates its structural domains through interactions with GTP to continuously catalyze thus reactions and thereby synthesize CTP correctly remains elusive. Through cryo-EM analysis of 34 structural states (2.0-3.3 [A] resolution) spanning pre-catalytic, catalytic, and post-catalytic conformations, we delineate how GTP cycling (intact binding and dissociation) directly gates three sequential activation checkpoints. 1) Catalytic initiation gate: GTP dissociation precedes substrate entry, transitioning CTPS to a substrate-competent state. 2) Intermediate-dependent GTP recruitment: 4Pi-UTP formation allosterically remodels the GAT domain, licensing GTP rebinding. 3) Ammonia transfer gate: GTP directly constitutes the transient interdomain gas tunnel for ammonia delivery while stimulating the glutamine hydrolyzing. CTP synthesis completion triggers GTP dissociation, allowing glutamate release. Each catalytic cycle couples CTP production to a single GTP-binding event, demonstrating that GTP cycling operates as a catalytic-phase timer. This work provides a comprehensive model for the efficient catalysis of CTPS and establishes effector cycling as a dynamic gating mechanism in enzymes.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

This study confirmed the inevitability and universality of Hyperdynamic microcirculation in sepsis, and put forward the detoxification mechanism of Hyperdynamic blood flow and the \"Xinghuai Feng- Bernoulli warm shock\" mechanism, that is, the pathogenic mechanism of sepsis. Methods: Sepsis models of pigs, rabbits Mice  rats and sheep were established by intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cecal ligation and perforation (CLP), and the changes of sublingual microcirculation velocity in the same branch before and after modeling were detected. SD rat model of mild sepsis was established to verify that the acceleration of blood flow is the manifestation of immune detoxification mechanism. Results: The blood flow in the same branch was accelerated after the animal sepsis model was established, which was more than doubled on average. The microcirculation blood flow accelerated before the change of cardiac output CO. Rats entered a toxic state after the rapid blood flow occurred, but they could heal themselves. Conclusion: The acceleration of microcirculation blood flow in sepsis is inevitable and universal, which is the cause of high output and low resistance of sepsis, and has the functions of accelerating detoxification and immunity. However, due to Bernoulli effect, it will cause oxygen exchange disorder, which is named \"Xinghuai Feng- Bernoulli warm shock\", ultimately leading to hypoxia. This is the primary pathogenic mechanism of early sepsis. Since the completion of this article in 2023, its principles have undergone multicenter, randomized, and double-blind clinical verification, achieving satisfactory results.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders remain incompletely understood, largely owing to the absence of models faithfully recapitulating the human disease. Here, we developed an in vitro human cartilage model using isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying either wild-type or Arg719Cys COL2A1. Directed differentiation into chondrocytes yielded cartilage tissues that were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and RNA-sequencing. Tissues derived from Arg719Cys heterozygotes displayed a deficient matrix, closely reflecting the human disease phenotype. Arg719Cys procollagen-II was excessively post-translationally modified and partially retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to ER distention. Notably, despite introduction of an aberrant cysteine residue -- expected to engage redox-sensitive folding and quality control pathways -- Arg719Cys procollagen-II was not detectably recognized by the ER proteostasis network. The resulting inability to mount a quality control response, including activation of the unfolded protein response, indicates a failure in cellular surveillance. As a result, malformed procollagen-II both accumulates intracellularly and is secreted, contributing to the deposition of a structurally compromised extracellular matrix that drives disease pathology. The iPSC-derived cartilage model presented here provides a genetically defined and expandable, human-based system for dissecting the mechanisms of failed proteostasis in collagenopathies. These findings shed light on the types of substitutions in procollagen that cells can or cannot recognize, and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting cellular surveillance and collagen quality control pathways in COL2A1-related disorders and beyond.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Y.; Heydari, H.; Nguyen Ba, A. N.", "abstract": "Genotype-phenotype mapping (GPM), or the association of trait variation to genetic variation, has been a long-lasting problem in biology. The existing approaches to this problem allowed researchers to partially understand within- and between-species variation as well as the emergence or evolution of phenotypes. However, traditional GPM methods typically ignore the transcriptome or have low statistical power due to challenges related to dataset scale. Thus, it is not clear to what extent selection modulates transcriptomes and whether cis- or trans-regulatory elements are more important. To overcome these challenges, we leveraged the cost efficiency and scalability of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by collecting data from 18,233 yeast cells from 4,489 F2 segregants derived from an F1 cross between the laboratory strain BY4741 and the vineyard strain RM11-1a. More precisely, we performed eQTL mapping with the scRNA-seq data to identify single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) and transcriptome variation patterns associated with fitness variation inferred from the segregant bulk fitness assay. Due to the larger scale of our dataset and its multidimensionality, we could recapitulate results from decades of work in GPM from yeast bulk assays while revealing new associations between phenotypic and transcriptomic variations at a broad scale. We evaluated the strength of the association between phenotype variation and expression variation, revealed new hotspots of gene expression regulation associated with trait variation, revealed new gene functions with high expression heritability, and highlighted the larger aggregate effect of trans-regulation compared to cis-regulation. Altogether, these results suggest that integrating large-scale scRNA-seq data into GPM improves our understanding of trait variation in the context of transcriptomic regulation.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

It is poorly understood how cells selectively silence pre-existing, pro-growth transcripts, yet efficiently translate transcriptionally-induced stress mRNA, and whether these transcriptional and post-transcriptional responses are coordinated. Here, we show that following acute glucose withdrawal in S. cerevisiae, pre-existing mRNAs are not first degraded to halt protein synthesis, nor are they sequestered away in P-bodies. Rather, their translation is rapidly repressed through a sequence-independent mechanism that differentiates between mRNAs produced before and after stress followed by their decay. Transcriptional induction of endogenous transcripts and reporter mRNAs during stress is sufficient to escape translational repression, while induction prior to stress leads to repression.

The mechanisms behind this decline are not fully understood. While excessive production of endothelin 1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, is linked to many diseases that increase with age, the role of ET-1 and its receptors in axon regeneration is unknown. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we show that satellite glial cells (SGCs), which completely envelop the sensory neuron soma residing in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), express the endothelin B receptor (ETBR), while ET-1 is expressed by endothelial cells. Inhibition of ETBR ex-vivo in DRG explant cultures improves axon growth in both adult and aged conditions. In vivo, treatment with the FDA-approved compound, Bosentan, improves axon regeneration and reverses the age-dependent decrease in axonal regenerative capacity. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing and electron microscopy analyses reveal a decreased abundance of SGCs in aged mice compared to adult mice. Additionally, the decreased expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) in SGCs in aged mice after nerve injury is partially rescued by Bosentan treatment.

S.; Mao, L.", "abstract": "Background: The solution space of an FBA-based model of cellular metabolism, can be characterised by extraction of a bounded, low dimensional kernel (the SSK) that facilitates perceiving it as a geometric object in multidimensional flux space. The aim is to produce an amenable description, intermediate between the single feasible extreme flux of FBA, and the intractable proliferation of extreme modes in conventional solution space descriptions. Fluxes that remain fixed are separated off while the focus of interest is put on the subset of variable fluxes that have a nonzero but finite range of values. For unbounded fluxes, a finite subrange that geometrically corresponds to the variable flux range is determined and is supplemented by a limited set of rays that encapsulates their unbounded aspects. In this way the kernel emphasises the realistic range of flux variation allowed in the interconnected biochemical network by e.g. limited nutrient uptake, an optimised objective and other model constraints. This work builds on the full presentation of the SSK approach in a research monograph. Results: It is demonstrated how knowledge of the SSK and accompanying rays can be exploited to explore representative flux states of the metabolic network. Noting that bioengineering interventions such as gene knockouts modify the solution space, new tools based on the SSK analysis are presented here that predict the effects of such interventions on a target flux constructed to represent a desired metabolic output. A simple metabolic model is used first to demonstrate the special concepts and constructions needed to define and compute the SSK. The demonstration model is tweaked to produce typical behaviours of larger models, but with kernels in 1,2 or 3 dimensions that are explicitly displayed to visualise the concepts. General applicability to models where visualisation is inaccessible, is illustrated by showing evaluation of potential bioengineering strategies for a genome scale model. Conclusions: SSKernel is a flexible interactive tool that facilitates an overview of the FBA solution space as a multidimensional geometric object, in terms of a manageable number of parameters. It allows exploration of effects on this solution space from metabolic interventions, and can be used to investigate bioengineering strategies to manipulate cellular metabolism.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

In this study, we propose an interpretable and scalable inference framework, DeepTX, that leverages deep learning methods to connect mechanistic models and scRNA-seq data, thereby revealing genome-wide transcriptional burst kinetics. This framework enables rapid and accurate solutions to transcription models and the inference of transcriptional burst kinetics from scRNA-seq data. Applying this framework to several scRNA-seq datasets of DNA-damaging drug treatments, we observed that fluctuations in transcriptional bursting induced by different drugs could lead to distinct fate decisions: IdU treatment induces differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells by increasing the burst size of gene expression, while 5FU treatment with low and high dose increases the burst frequency of gene expression to induce cell apoptosis and survival in human colon cancer cells. Together, these results show that DeepTX can be used to analyze single-cell transcriptomics data and can provide mechanistic insights into cell fate decisions.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Methods: Carotid ligation was performed in an in vivo model of selective Miro1 deletion in smooth muscle cells. VSMC proliferation during the cell cycle and molecular mechanisms of smooth muscle cell proliferation were explored in cultured aortic VSMCs by imaging mitochondrial positioning and cristae structure and assessing the effects on ATP production, metabolic function and interactions with components of the electron transport chain (ETC). MIRO1 expression was analyzed in human coronary arteries, and its function was assessed via knockdown in human coronary artery VSMCs. Results: Results revealed strong MIRO1 expression in VSMCs within human atherosclerotic plaques. MIRO1 facilitated VSMC proliferation and neointima formation by regulating mitochondrial positioning and PDGF-stimulated ATP production and respiration, critical for cell-cycle progression at G1/S. Deletion of Miro1 disrupted mitochondrial cristae structure, diminished ETC complex I activity, and impaired super complex formation. Notably, restoring MIRO1 function with a mutant lacking EF hands, which are essential for mitochondrial mobility, only partially rescued these effects. MIRO1 knockdown in human coronary artery VSMCs confirmed its pivotal role in mitochondrial function and VSMC proliferation. Conclusions: This study highlights two key mechanisms by which MIRO1 regulates VSMC proliferation. First, it maintains ATP synthesis by preserving mitochondrial cristae integrity. Second, its Ca2+-dependent EF hands enable ATP-dependent mitochondrial positioning.

The Fmr1 KO mice exhibited fragmented sleep, impaired locomotor rhythmicity, and attenuated behavioral responses to light, linked to an abnormal retinal innervation and reduction of light-evoked neuronal activation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Behavioral testing revealed significant deficits in social memory and increased repetitive behaviors in the mutants, which correlated with sleep fragmentation. Remarkably, a scheduled feeding paradigm (6-hour feeding/18-hour fasting) significantly enhanced circadian rhythmicity, consolidated sleep, and improved social deficits and repetitive behaviors in the Fmr1 KO mice. This intervention also normalized the elevated levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 and IFN-gamma, in the mutants blood, suggesting that its benefits extend to inflammatory pathways.

A key question for protein evolution and engineering is how often epistasis extends beyond pairwise interactions to involve three or more positions. Although experimental data has accumulated rapidly in recent years, addressing this question remains challenging, as the number of possible interactions is typically enormous even for proteins of moderate size. Here, we introduce an interpretable machine learning framework for studying higher-order epistasis scalable to full-length proteins. Our model builds on the transformer architecture, with key modifications allowing us to assess the importance of higher-order interactions by fitting a series of models with increasing complexity. Applying our method to 10 large protein sequence-function datasets, we found that while additive effects explain the majority of the variance, within the epistatic component, the contribution of higher-order epistasis ranges from negligible to up to $60 \\%$. We also found higher-order epistasis is particularly important for generalizing locally sampled fitness data to distant regions of sequence space and for modeling an additional multi-peak fitness landscape. Our findings suggest that higher-order epistasis can play important roles in protein sequence-function relationships, and thus should be properly considered in protein engineering and evolutionary data analysis.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

While molecular glue degraders typically interact with both CRL and the substrate8-10, SINEs bind to XPO1 without requiring interaction with ASB8 for efficient XPO1 degradation. Instead, an allosteric mechanism facilitates high affinity XPO1-ASB8 interaction, leading to XPO1 ubiquitination and degradation. ASB8-mediated degradation is also observed upon treatment of the endogenous itaconate derivate 4-octyl itaconate, which suggests a native mechanism that is inadvertently exploited by synthesized XPO1 inhibitors.

Here, we interrogated gene expression variation in C. elegans, including the first allele-specific expression analysis in this system, capturing effects in cis and in trans that govern gene expression differences between the reference strain N2 and seven wild strains. We observed extensive compensatory regulation, in which opposite effects in cis and trans at individual genes mitigate expression differences among strains, and that genes with expression differences exhibit strain specificity. As the genomic distance increased between N2 and each wild strain, the number of genes with expression differences also increased. We also report for the first time that expression-variable genes are lower expressed on average than genes without expression differences, a trend that may extend to humans and Drosophila melanogaster and may reflect the selection constraints that govern the universal anticorrelation between gene expression and rate of protein evolution. Together, these and other observed trends support the conclusion that many C. elegans genes are under stabilizing selection for expression level, but we also highlight outliers that may be biologically significant.

Our analysis identifies at least four different GBM cell populations with unique ECM expression profiles that show spatial enrichment in distinct intratumor regions. Spatial mapping also demonstrates largely non-overlapping expression signatures of various ECM components in GBM stromal cell types, particularly in vascular endothelial cells and reactive microglia/macrophages. Comparisons of GBM (IDH1 wild type) versus lower-grade II and III astrocytoma samples (IDH1 R132H) identifies differential expression of key ECM components, including elevated levels of select ECM glycoproteins (IGFBP2 and MGP) and ECM-affiliated proteins (ANXA1 and ANXA2). In addition, we detect spatially enriched expression of COL8A1 (collagen), LUM (proteoglycan), and POSTN (ECM glycoprotein) in perivascular stromal cells in GBM but not in lower grade tumors. Computational analysis of putative ligand-receptor interactions reveals novel ECM communication networks between cancer cells and stromal components, particularly in regions of GBM microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis.

While UV-induced SOS responses are well characterized in bacteria, the cellular consequences of prolonged UV-B exposure remain less clear. Prolonged UV-B exposure disrupts translation and RecA-mediated SOS induction without major changes in membrane permeability or reactive oxygen species. This impairs mutagenesis and induces a reversible loss of culturability. Genetic analysis reveals both redundant and differential roles for DNA repair pathways: homologous recombination (RecA, RecB), nucleotide excision repair (UvrA), and translesion synthesis (UmuC/D) are essential for maintaining mutagenesis and culturability, while others (RecN, RmuC) have limited impact. Notably, deletion of UvrD (a repair-associated helicase) intensifies transient non-culturability without affecting mutagenesis, underscoring complexity in repair networks. Overall, our findings reveal a dose-dependent trade-off: moderate UV-B promotes mutagenesis with minimal viability loss, whereas prolonged exposure suppresses mutagenesis via transient dormancy, reflecting an adaptive strategy with significant evolutionary implications.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

We revisit the state of Pacific salmon spawner data from the Yukon to southern BC. Almost two-thirds of historically monitored salmon populations have no reported estimates in 2014-2023 -- the worst decade for data since broadscale surveys began in the 1950s. We found positive associations between the number of populations monitored and landed value for three of the five Pacific salmon species, suggesting that monitoring is, in part, motivated by the information needs of commercial fisheries management.

A.", "abstract": "Social behaviour is a key part of life for many species. In monogamously breeding species, social associations between breeding partners are particularly important. Selection of a breeding partner often begins well before reproduction, and this process can affect subsequent reproductive success. Thus, the non-breeding season can shape behaviour during the breeding season. However, it is currently unknown how breeding season outcomes can impact associate choice during the non-breeding season, as studying this requires high volumes of cross-context individual social data. This study used three years of wild great tit social data from Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, to examine social associations between pairs classified with respect to prior and future breeding status (divorcing, faithful, new and juvenile). We found distinct patterns of social association in 'divorcing' pairs from early winter, suggesting that divorce is an ongoing behavioural process. Newly forming pairs initially associated similarly to divorcing pairs, but became similar to faithful pairs over time. On a finer spatiotemporal scale, the behaviour of faithful and divorcing birds diverged over the winter. These results provide the first evidence of a behavioural signature of divorce during the non-breeding season in great tits, while suggesting that different behaviours may drive behavioural divorce at different times.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

How different cells respond to aligned fibrils and how internal regulators like formins and Arp2/3 control contact guidance is unknown. In this study, a unique system to assemble aligned collagen fibrils on mica and to transfer them onto controllable substrates is used to probe contact guidance. This fibril alignment system reveals that cytoskeletal regulation through myosin contractility and not receptor expression drives contact guidance ability. Highly contractile cells exhibit high-fidelity contact guidance, weakly contractile cells ignore cues and moderately contractile cells use a mixture of both parallel and perpendicular migration strategies on aligned collagen fibrils. In addition to myosin contractility, formins and Arp2/3 control contact guidance in a reciprocal manner across a variety of cell types. Formins, mediators of linear F-actin structures, enhance contact guidance and Arp2/3, a mediator of branched F-actin structures, diminishes contact guidance.

Despite decades of research, substantial sequence and length variation of promoter elements has hindered efforts to elucidate their function and the evolutionary diversity of transcriptional regulation. Combining massively parallel assays, biophysical modeling, and functional validation, we systematically dissected the promoter architecture upstream of experimentally determined transcription start sites in 49 phylogenetically diverse bacterial genomes (GC content: 27.8-72.1%). We identified a conserved 3-bp promoter element, termed start, that dictates transcription start site selection and enhances transcription. We uncovered a four-region organization within the variable spacer element, whose sequence composition modulates transcription by up to 600-fold. We showed that the discriminator element is conserved in Terrabacteria but diverse in Gracilicutes, the two major bacterial clades. High discriminator sequence diversity in Gracilicutes likely reflects diversifying evolution, enabling promoter-encoded regulation to orchestrate global gene expression in response to growth rate changes. Together, our findings reveal broad conservation of bacterial promoter organization while highlighting regulatory divergence of promoter elements and RNA polymerase between Terrabacteria and Gracilicutes. Sequence and functional similarities between bacterial promoter elements and their archaeal and eukaryotic counterparts further suggest a shared evolutionary origin of promoter architecture.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Introduction: Peripheral nerve reinnervation following nerve injury is often a slow and incomplete process, resulting in significant morbidity and permanent loss of function of the injured extremity in many patients. Prior studies have shown the efficacy of electrical stimulation to synchronize the axonal regeneration of both motor and sensory neurons in peripheral nerve injury models. Moreover, separate investigations have also shown the use of cranial nerve stimulation, principally the vagus nerve, to improve functional outcomes. However, no study has investigated the synergistic effects of both intraoperative electrical stimulation and cranial nerve stimulation for functional improvement within a peripheral nerve injury model. This investigation quantifies the efficacy of combined intraoperative electrical stimulation and trigeminal nerve stimulation on motor and sensory functional recovery in a rat peripheral nerve injury model. Methods: Twelve adult male Lewis rats were trained in a reach and pull task for a food reward using their right forelimb with baseline force thresholds and percent success of the pull task recorded. Baseline sensory data was retrieved using an automated von Frey monofilament test. All rats underwent surgical transection and 2mm gap repair of their median and ulnar nerve of their right forelimb followed by 1 hour of intraoperative electrical stimulation. Trigeminal nerve stimulation throughout the rehabilitation period was completed via supraorbital nerve headcap electrodes. Motor and sensory data were compared to historic cohorts comprised of sham surgery (no nerve injury), brief intraoperative electrical stimulation, trigeminal nerve stimulation, and a sham peripheral and trigeminal nerve stimulation group. Polarization sensitive optical computed tomography (PS-OCT) was used to assess nerve regeneration in fixed tissue samples. Results: The combined cohort of rodents were able to recover to their pre-injury motor function by the third week of rehabilitation, faster than either of the singular electrical stimulation cohorts assessed previously. Moreover, functional sensory data of the combined stim cohort demonstrated no change when compared to their pre-injury baseline. Conclusions: Peripheral nerve electrical stimulation and trigeminal nerve stimulation are two separately acting mechanisms of therapy that employ electric waveforms to improve the functional recovery of injured peripheral nerves. The former acts within the periphery to synchronize axonal growth and regeneration of the injured neurons, while the latter acts centrally to augment neuroplasticity. When used simultaneously in a rodent peripheral nerve injury model, these modalities have shown to build upon each other to deliver a faster functional motor recovery, while sensory recovery outcomes remain to be demonstrated.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "Aim: Genetic diversity contains valuable information about ecological and evolutionary aspects of species, such as historical demography. Intraspecific genetic variation is shaped by species natural history traits and by characteristics of geography and climate within their ranges. Salamanders (Order Caudata) are amphibians of ecological and conservation interest because of their global distribution, trait diversity, and roles within ecological communities. Here, we studied genetic variation within salamanders to investigate predictors of nucleotide diversity and spatial patterns of genetic differentiation. Location: Global. Time Period: Present. Major Taxa Studied: Salamanders. Methods: We repurposed mitochondrial DNA sequences, natural history traits, and geographic and environmental data from open-access databases for 214 salamander species. We calculated nucleotide diversity (pi) and tested for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE) within each species. We analyzed these three response variables with random forest analyses and phylogenetic comparative methods using 27 predictors expected to be associated with genetic variation (e.g., number of offspring, total range size). Results: We recovered 8,175 Cytb sequences with their associated geographic coordinates, of which 7,007 sequences were manually curated by us. Species range size and sample size (the number of sequences) were important predictors of genetic variation. We found higher diversity in regions including the Neotropics and central-eastern Europe. The absence of strong phylogenetic signal in pi, IBD, and IBE suggests that genetic variation is shaped by local ecological and geographical factors rather than by shared ancestry. Main Conclusions: Our finding that range size was an important predictor of genetic variation aligns with theoretical expectations that species with larger ranges tend to harbor more genetic diversity. Our results underscore the importance of integrating spatial data (i.e., DNA sequences and their associated coordinates) into macrogenetic studies, providing valuable information for future studies and conservation strategies targeting regions with high or low genetic diversity.

If left untreated these GI symptoms compromise life quality and may contribute to death. We hypothesized GI symptoms in CLN3 disease are at least partially due to neurodegeneration in the enteric nervous system (ENS), the master regulator of bowel function. Methods: We examined the integrity of the ENS in human CLN3 autopsy small bowel and colon, and in CLN3 deficient (Cln3{Delta}ex7/8) mice. We performed detailed immunohistological analyses of enteric neurons and glia and assessed bowel transit times at multiple disease stages. We then tested the therapeutic potential of neonatal intravenous gene therapy (AAV9-hCLN3) to prevent bowel phenotypes in Cln3{Delta}ex7/8 mice. Results: Human CLN3 bowel displayed a profound loss of enteric neurons and their neurites, with pathological effects upon enteric glia. Cln3{Delta}ex7/8 mice had normal appearing ENS at 1 month of age, but then experienced progressive loss of both enteric neurons and glia accompanied by marked bowel distention, resembling the human CLN3 phenotype. Degenerative changes in Cln3{Delta}ex7/8 mouse enteric neurons and glia were largely prevented by systemic neonatal delivery of AAV9-hCLN3 gene therapy, preventing bowel distention at disease endstage. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that CLN3 deficiency profoundly damages enteric neurons and glia in both murine and human CLN3 disease, contributing to GI dysfunction.

Although many of these are commonly used, there has not been a detailed investigation of existing variants and their impacts on results and interpretations. Here we summarize the types of variants and their prevalence in the literature, and we present a comprehensive comparison of differences between them. A key finding is that a common variant that uses the minimum of assimilation rates rather than the minimum of carboxylation rates, which we call the \"min-A variant,\" makes different predictions than the original \"min-W variant,\" yet appears in approximately half of highly-cited publications and software tools that use the FvCB model. Another concern is that although leaf biochemistry restricts the range of CO2 partial pressures where limitations due to triose phosphate utilization (TPU) can occur, this restriction is commonly omitted from the model's equations. Among other potential issues, these variations can introduce errors exceeding 20% when estimating photosynthetic parameter values from CO2 response curves. It is therefore important to be aware of this source of error when fitting the model, to avoid using the min-A variant, and to include the biochemically-derived CO2 threshold for TPU limitations.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated NOR task performance in male Lister Hooded rats following regional neural disinhibition or functional inhibition, using intra-cerebral microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin or agonist muscimol, respectively. Our infusion targets were the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal hippocampus and ventral hippocampus. Using a within-subjects design, we compared NOR task performance (1-min retention delay) following bilateral regional saline, picrotoxin or muscimol infusions made before the acquisition phase. In mPFC, neither functional inhibition nor neural disinhibition affected object recognition memory. However, in both dorsal and ventral hippocampus, neural disinhibition impaired NOR relative to saline control, mainly by reducing novel object exploration time. In addition, functional inhibition of dorsal hippocampus impaired NOR, whereas ventral hippocampal functional inhibition tended to reduce novel object exploration at the highest dose used (alongside substantial non-specific behavioural effects). Overall, our data suggest that hippocampal, but not prefrontal, GABAergic inhibition contributes to NOR at a 1-min retention delay. Moreover, such NOR performance likely requires balanced neural activity in the dorsal hippocampus, with both too little and too much dorsal hippocampal activity impairing NOR memory.

Despite its broad adoption across species and behaviors, current usage frequently overlooks quantitative-oriented kinematic analyses due to the complexity and noise present in raw model outputs. Researchers are often challenged by the computational expertise required to clean, refine, and interpret the generated data effectively. Here, we introduce refineDLC, an innovative and comprehensive post-processing pipeline explicitly designed to streamline the conversion of noisy DeepLabCut outputs into robust, analytically reliable kinematic data. Our user-friendly pipeline incorporates critical data cleaning steps, including inversion of y-coordinates for intuitive spatial interpretation, removal of zero-value frames, and exclusion of irrelevant body part labels. Additionally, it integrates robust, dual-stage filtering methods based on likelihood scores and positional changes, significantly enhancing the accuracy and consistency of data. Furthermore, our approach offers multiple interpolation strategies, effectively managing missing values to maintain data continuity and integrity. We evaluated the performance and versatility of our pipeline across two distinct datasets: controlled locomotion in cattle and field-recorded, highly variable trotting horse videos. Results demonstrated substantial improvements in the quality and interpretability of processed outputs, transforming initially noisy and inconsistent data into physiologically meaningful kinematic patterns. RefineDLC successfully reduced data variability and eliminated false-positive labeling errors, offering reliable and ready-to-analyze datasets irrespective of recording conditions and animal species. By simplifying the transformation from raw DeepLabCut outputs to meaningful kinematic insights, refineDLC significantly enhances accessibility and usability, enabling a broader range of researchers, especially those with limited programming expertise, to perform precise quantitative analyses. Looking forward, adaptive filtering algorithms and real-time quality assessment features are potential enhancements that could further optimize performance, expand pipeline applicability, and automate analysis.

One method to measure dispersal employs the Neutral Community Model (NCM) to quantify how a local community is influenced by the immigration of individuals from a larger source community. Conveniently, the immigration rate NTm of the NCM can be fit from biological sequence abundance datasets, which are plentiful. Yet it is neither known if these estimated values reflect the ground truth, nor what sampling effort is required to yield accurate estimates. In this study we introduce two inference methods, a variance-based and a Dirichlet-Multinomial Log-Likelihood (DM-LL) method, to complement the established occupancy-based inference method. In simulations of communities that resemble activated sludge microbiomes, all inference methods were capable of estimating NTm within 10% of ground-truth, with the variance-based and DM-LL methods requiring less sampling effort. Accurate inferences require read depths greater than NTm in each sample.

These patterns were recapitulated in a model where pulse-information transiently integrated at the CPP level is fed to and maintained at a bounded motor level, so that information presented later on in a trial is integrated only if a bound has not yet been reached.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Researchers must rely on this literature to find relevant information, but navigating this vast landscape has become increasingly challenging, especially for interdisciplinary AI-biomedicine researchers who need to stay current across both highly fast-paced fields. Despite the emergence of LLM systems, retrieving precise, domain-specific literature remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses these challenges by integrating knowledge graphs with scientific literature embedded in large language models to expedite biomedical discovery. We employ a novel strategy to discover the most relevant pathways between biomedical entities in knowledge graphs. These pathways are then leveraged by a multi-agent LLM system to formulate facts from literature, design AI predictors for understanding discovered pathways, and propose wet-lab experiments to validate AI predictions. This approach creates a comprehensive end-to-end methodology for biomedical discovery. Experiments with various biomedical entity pairs demonstrate the framework's ability to identify highly relevant pathways and design plausible, complex AI predictors with wet lab validation experiments across diverse therapeutic areas. We developed Intelliscope, a web-based dashboard making this framework available to researchers worldwide. This first-of-its-kind platform could significantly accelerate scientific discoveries, potentially leading to breakthroughs in disease understanding, drug repurposing, and therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Conventional approaches inadequately leverage the complementary nature of multimodal data, resulting in overfitting when handling high-dimensional omics data and constraining the comprehensive characterization of cancer subtype heterogeneity. To address this, Triad-LMF, a novel multi-omics integration framework, is introduced, leveraging a low-rank multimodal fusion mechanism to improve the Accuracy of cancer subtype classification. Triad-LMF consolidates multi-omics datasets, mitigating feature dimension disparities through optimized preprocessing. To enable efficient multimodal information integration, Triad-LMF implements a two-stage hierarchical fusion strategy, where in Local Pairwise Fusion and Global Triadic Fusion are combined via the Two-Feature and Three-way LMF modules, facilitating a progressive transition from local modality interactions to global feature integration. Experimental results demonstrate that Triad-LMF outperforms traditional machine learning methods and previous published methods in classification performance. UMAP verifies that Global Triadic Fusion significantly enhances the ability to discriminate against subtypes in implicit space representation. We further illustrate the effectiveness of Triad-LMF in making full use of multimodal interactive information. Additionally, SHAP feature importance analysis was adopted for extracting the important features. Moreover, across independent datasets, Triad-LMF demonstrates superior generalization capabilities.

M.; Petridis, S. F.; Phan, A.; Castellano, J. M.", "abstract": "There is little understanding of how aging serves as the strongest risk factor for several neurogenerative diseases. Specific neural cell types, such as microglia, undergo age-related maladaptive changes, including increased inflammation, impaired debris clearance, and cellular senescence, yet specific mediators that regulate these processes remain unclear. The aged brain is rejuvenated by youth-associated plasma factors, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), which we have shown acts on the extracellular matrix (ECM) to regulate synaptic plasticity. Given emerging roles for microglia in these processes, we examined the impact of TIMP2 on microglial function. We show that TIMP2 deletion exacerbates microglial phenotypes associated with aging, including transcriptomic changes in cell activation, increased microgliosis, and increased levels of stress and inflammatory proteins measured in the brain extracellular space by in vivo microdialysis. Deleting specific cellular pools of TIMP2 in vivo increased microglial activation and altered myelin phagocytosis. Treating aged mice with TIMP2 reversed several phenotypes observed in our deletion models, resulting in decreased microglial activation, reduced proportions of proinflammatory microglia, and enhanced phagocytosis of physiological substrates. Our results identify TIMP2 as a key modulator of age-associated microglia dysfunction.

To assess whether white-tailed deer continued to be infected with B.1.641 and to test for spillover into other species, we established a surveillance program in Ontario by sampling wildlife via existing monitoring programs and through active surveillance of captive and wild animals. Between 2022 to 2024, we tested 2,839 animals, identifying one active SARS-CoV-2 infection (a likely spillover of a recombinant XBB.2.3.11.3 lineage), but no cases of B.1.641. Overall, 93 animals (6.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including 89 white-tailed deer, two Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), one American mink (Neogale vison), and one river otter (Lontra canadensis). In Southwestern Ontario, where B.1.641 was originally detected, 15.2% of deer samples were seropositive. Generalized Linear Models demonstrated that seropositive deer were more likely to be found in areas with a higher fall deer harvest and human population density, and closer to previous B.1.641 cases.

A.; Hamid, J.; Kumar, A.; Rangamani, P.", "abstract": "The dynamics of calcium ions (Ca2+) in skeletal muscles link electrochemical activation and contractile force generation. An improved quantitative understanding of the mechanisms by which calcium dynamics modulate force production is crucial for optimizing muscle performance. Recent experimental data suggest that store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), the process of extracellular Ca2+ influx upon depletion of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), helps delay the onset of muscle fatigue. However, the mechanistic links between SOCE and sustained force generation in muscle remain unclear. We hypothesize that SOCE regulates force generation during sustained muscle activity by facilitating SR Ca2+ store refilling. We test this hypothesis with a quantitative biophysical model that simulates the biochemical events of muscle contraction, from initial depolarization at the sarcolemma and T-tubules to Ca2+ release from the SR to Ca2+ binding and force generation throughout the myoplasm. We also consider the balance between Ca2+ removal from the myoplasm and SOCE through the T-tubule membrane. We estimate the free parameters in the model by fitting them to experiments that measured sarcolemma membrane voltage and myoplasmic Ca2+ transients in single muscle fibers in vitro. We then test the effects of SOCE inhibition on Ca2+ dynamics and force production and find that the magnitude of myoplasmic calcium and force are significantly lower than in wild-type cells over repetitive stimuli. Finally, we predict the effects of varying the degree of SOCE inhibition during patterns of stimulus chosen to mimic those observed during resistance exercise or high-intensity interval training. These simulations predict a context-dependent relationship between force generation and SOCE, wherein increased SOCE is associated with greater force production during resistance exercise, but worsens the effects of fatigue in certain cases of high-intensity training.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Induction of viral mimicry by activation of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors has potential therapeutic applications for TNBC and other cancers. Suppressors of dsRNA sensing prevent sensing of endogenous dsRNAs and resulting autoimmunity. Depletion of the suppressor of dsRNA sensing ADAR1 causes activation of dsRNA sensors and cell death in many cancer cell lines. These ADAR1-dependent cells are generally also dependent on the dsRNA-binding protein PACT, which is highly expressed and essential in many TNBC cell lines. While PACT is known as an activator of the dsRNA sensor PKR, overexpression of PACT had no effect on activation of PKR in multiple TNBC cell lines. Conversely, depletion of PACT in PACT-dependent cell lines caused robust activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR and cell death, in addition to induction of integrated stress response genes and NF-{kappa}B targets. These phenotypes were entirely dependent on PKR. Rescue experiments revealed that PACT dimerization and dsRNA binding is required to suppress PKR activation. While depletion of PACT alone in ADAR1/ PACT-independent cell lines had no effect on PKR activation, combined depletion of both PACT and ADAR1 in those cell lines caused robust PKR activation and cell death, supporting a partially redundant role for ADAR1 and PACT in suppression of dsRNA sensing. Taken together, these findings support a vital role for PACT in suppressing PKR activation and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting PACT to treat TNBC.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

NOTCH3 is primarily expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models and developmental lineage-specific VSMC differentiation, we revealed a selective vulnerability of cerebral but not peripheral VSMC mimics to NOTCH3 variants. Transcriptomic, protein and functional analyses demonstrated a switching of CADASIL iPSC-VSMCs from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype, accompanied with extensive extracellular matrix accumulation and impairment of cell adhesion leading to anoikis.

The Southern Ocean is among the regions where these impacts are particularly pronounced. Phytoplankton, which perform the bulk of primary production, both maintain the Antarctic marine food web and contribute to the role of the Southern Ocean as the largest oceanic sink for atmospheric CO2. Previous observational and modeling studies have revealed certain drivers-phytoplankton relationships and highlighted the important confounding factors. In this study, we quantified how climate and environmental drivers interact and influence phytoplankton biomass over a 20-year period, across the entire Southern Ocean, within a multi-factor framework. Specifically, we examined the relationships among atmospheric CO2, surface water pH, sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, dissolved iron concentration, and chlorophyll a concentration. To perform this analysis, we introduced and applied two novel methodological approaches. Firstly, to address seasonal autocorrelation, we combined seasonal trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) with piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM). This approach allowed for robust estimation of long-term driver magnitudes and causal pathways, even in the presence of limited sample sizes and complex data structures. Secondly, given the highly interconnected nature of environmental drivers, we employed a data-driven SEM approach to objectively identify causal structures and avoid biases associated with a priori pathway selection. Our results show a clear signal of ocean acidification driven by increasing CO2, iron limitation of phytoplankton biomass during spring, and seasonal differences in both the magnitude and structure of the causal pathways, demonstrating the dynamic nature of seasonal processes in the Southern Ocean. This study presents the first Southern Ocean-wide, multi-factor assessment of climate and environmental impacts on phytoplankton biomass over a two-decade period. It introduces a methodological framework mitigates seasonal autocorrelation to accurately capture long-term seasonal trends, and demonstrates the utility of data-driven causal discovery in resolving complex ecological interactions.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Using longitudinal data collected at baseline and Year 2 from 2,949 individuals (ages 8.9-13.5) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we show that baseline resting-state functional connectivity (FC) more strongly predicts future cognitive ability than concurrent cognitive ability. Models trained on baseline FC to predict baseline cognition generalize better to Year 2 data, suggesting that brain-cognition relationships strengthen over time. Intriguingly, baseline FC outperforms longitudinal FC change in predicting future cognitive ability. Differences in measurement reliability do not fully explain this discrepancy: although FC change is less reliable (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.24) than baseline FC (ICC = 0.56), matching baseline FC reliability by shortening scan time only partially narrows the predictive gap. Furthermore, neither baseline FC nor FC change meaningfully predicts longitudinal change in cognitive ability. We also identify converging and diverging predictive network features across cross-sectional and longitudinal models of brain-cognition relationships, revealing a multivariate twist on Simpsons paradox. Together, these findings suggest that during early adolescence, stable individual differences in brain functional network organization exert a stronger influence on future cognitive outcomes than short-term changes.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Second, we conducted a new Tn-seq analysis, which identified 346 genes as essential, of which 283 are in common with the previous report and might be considered a provisional essential gene set that minimizes false positives. We compare the list of essential genes to those of other bacteria, especially Bacillus subtilis, highlighting some noteworthy differences.

KCNE-family subunits (KCNE1-5) associate with KCNQ1, conferring distinct properties across various tissues. KCNQ1 activation requires membrane depolarization and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) whose cellular levels are controlled by Gq-coupled GPCR activation. While modulation of KCNQ1's voltage-dependent activation by KCNE1/3 is well-characterized, their effects on PIP2-dependent gating of KCNQ1 via GPCR signaling remain less understood. Here we resolved structures of KCNQ1-KCNE1 and reassessed reported KCNQ1-KCNE3 structures with and without PIP2. We revealed that KCNQ1-KCNE1/3 complexes feature two PIP2-binding sites, with KCNE1/3 contributing to a previously overlooked, uncharacterized site involving residues critical for voltage sensor and pore domain coupling. Via this site, KCNE1 and KCNE3 distinctly modulate the PIP2-dependent gating, in addition to the voltage sensitivity, of KCNQ1. Consequently, KCNE3 converts KCNQ1 into a voltage-insensitive PIP2-gated channel governed by GPCR signaling to maintain ion homeostasis in non-excitable cells. KCNE1, by significantly enhancing KCNQ1's PIP2 affinity and resistance to GPCR regulation, forms predominantly voltage-gated channels with KCNQ1 for conducting the slow-delayed rectifier current in excitable cardiac cells.

Although genetic studies in model systems have identified shared roles for a few CLE genes and species-specific redundancies, an evolutionary analysis of the entire family over deep time could empower predictive and experimental dissections of functions obscured by redundancy. We developed a scanning pipeline that de novo annotated CLE genes from 2,000 genomes representing 1,000 species, uncovering thousands of previously undetected family members and producing a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction and tracing of the family's evolution and sequence diversification over 140 million years. Computational modeling of coding and cis-regulatory regions predicted lineage-specific asymmetries in paralog redundancy, stemming from ancestral amino acids in the functional core of the dodecapeptide and partial conservation of promoter elements. We tested these predictions using two genome-editing strategies in Solanaceae. Base-editing of deeply conserved residues in the CLV3 dodecapeptide and its paralogs across three species confirmed their critical roles in repressing stem-cell proliferation, and multiplex CRISPR knockouts of the 52 tomato CLE genes resolved pairwise and higher-order redundancies, revealing previously uncharacterized regulators of shoot architecture and plant size.

A.; Vishwanath, A.; Barnes, C. A.; Cowen, S. L.", "abstract": "Hippocampal theta oscillations regulate the timing of neurons to support navigation, memory formation, and sensorimotor integration. Theta is modulated by running speed, breathing, whisking, and jumping and increases in tasks involving memory encoding or retrieval. The positive relationship between theta frequency and running speed is believed stabilize hippocampal representations of space amid movement variability. Here, we incorporated a novel string-pulling task to determine if established relationships between movement and theta hold when progress to a reward is determined by the length of string pulled. This task eliminates many speed-associated inputs, such vestibular, visual, and hindlimb information, and allows an unprecedented level of precision in the analysis of individual paw movements. Given that animals move the string a fixed length to acquire a reward, we predicted that the positive relationship between theta frequency and speed would hold. Approach: Five Sprague Dawley rats (4 mo.) were trained to continuously pull a string a fixed distance of 208 cm using an automated string-pulling system and run on a track for food reward. Local-field data was acquired from electrodes in dorsal CA1. Results: Relationships between theta and movement speed were distinct during string pulling and running. While theta was robust in both conditions, frequency was significantly reduced during string-pulling and showed no speed-frequency coupling, unlike running. This difference could result from the conflict between hindlimb and forelimb signals, with only forelimb movement signaling advancement. Fine-grained analysis of paw movements during string-pulling (lift, advance, grasp, pull, push) revealed that theta power and frequency peaked during the contralateral paw downward push despite paw speed being low during this action. This suggests that theta frequency and power could respond to effort rather than purely kinematic information. Notably, running-associated theta may similarly reflect both speed and effort as most locomotor tasks conflate these variables. Finally, theta phase aligned from one reach-pull cycle to the next during the downward pull motion - the first action that directly advances the string forward. Since phase-locking has been associated with sensorimotor gating, synchrony at this point could reflect the gating of inputs that are the most causally relevant for reaching the reward, potentially facilitating integration of action-outcome signals for memory encoding and navigation. Taken together, these data support a dual-scale view of hippocampal processing and theta-band activity where macroscale theta activity requires suprathreshold sensory, vestibular, and proprioceptive drive and microscale theta remains sensitive to subsecond limb movements.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Recently, synchrotron X-ray Nano Holotomography (XNH) imaging has gained momentum in microstructural studies owing to its unique combination of capabilities, including a wide field of view (FOV), nanoscale resolution, and fast volumetric acquisition. However, the 3D segmentation of tiny and densely packed microstructures within the WM, the very first step toward quantification, presents a significant bottleneck. Herein, we address this challenge using an expert-in-the-loop 3D deep learning (DL) framework. The initial model was a 3D U-Net architecture trained on sparsely annotated data, exclusively from the corpus callosum (CC), a region characterized by relatively simple axonal morphology and parallel orientation of axonal bundles. The high-confidence predictions (p > 0.7) from both CC and complex crossing fiber regions are then refined by an expert and reintegrated into the training process to expand the training dataset and corresponding labels. Building upon this foundation, we benchmarked alternative architectures, including 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformer-based architectures, alongside different loss functions. We showcased the segmentation performance of the models on XNH volumes with varying microstructural morphology and organization complexities. All DL architectures achieved satisfactory performance with overall segmentation accuracy > 0.96 and an average Dice score > 0.8 in 3D segmentation of axons, blood vessels, cells, and vacuoles. This study presents a multi-class 3D segmentation of WM microstructures in large FOVs up to 202 x 202 x 780 m3 scanned through XNH technology. Our framework not only accelerates high-fidelity segmentation in challenging datasets but also paves the way for fast quantitative analysis in large-scale 3D neuroimaging studies.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Mutations in RBC plasma membrane proteins can give rise to a spectrum of diseases characterized by hemolysis, inefficient gas exchange, and anemia. We tested whether emerin (EMD), a nuclear envelope (NE) protein, is also expressed in anuclear cell types to regulate membrane structure and function. We find that emerin is localized to the RBC plasma membrane and regulates the localization of other membrane proteins involved in actin branching and cytoskeletal dynamics. Additionally, we find that loss of Emd in mice results in decreased RBC corpuscular volume and hemoglobin content in both sexes, as well as a male-specific increase in RBC number and hematocrit, consistent with other male-dominated EMD phenotypes. Along with decreased RBC size, we observed a reduction in the rate of osmotic lysis in Emd KO animals, particularly males. We found that human EMD mutations also have a statistically significant association with RBC phenotypes, namely MCV. Individuals with emerin-related Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) also demonstrate a mild yet consistent RBC phenotype according to patient CBC data. Together, these data suggest that emerin can have cell-specific localization and functions independent of its canonical repertoire in nucleated cells.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a chromatin remodeling protein and member of the NuRD complex, which predominantly represses transcription. CHD4 is mutated in endometrial carcinoma, with most mutations leading to loss of function. CHD4 has been identified as a tumor suppressor and regulator of stemness in endometrial carcinoma cells, but little is known about the tissue-specific roles of CHD4 in the endometrial epithelia in vivo. We generated a conditional Chd4 floxed allele and combined it with BAC-Sprr2f-Cre to drive Chd4 loss in the endometrial epithelium. Consistent with previous reports, BAC-Sprr2f-Cre expression is absent in the oviducts, ovaries, and kidneys, and it shows variegated expression within the endometrial epithelium. Loss of CHD4 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and stained cells were quantified to determine the percentage of endometrial epithelial cells with and without CHD4. Compared to the glandular epithelium, the extent of CHD4 loss was higher in the luminal epithelium and unaffected by age. Mice with conditional knockout of Chd4 had normal endometrial histology. A 6-month breeding trial was performed to assess the functional effects of endometrial epithelial Chd4 loss on fertility. No difference in litter size, mean number of pups per litter per dam, or pup weight was found between genotypes. These findings demonstrate that Chd4 conditional loss using BAC-Sprr2f-Cre is not sufficient to alter the structure and function of the endometrial epithelium or drive tumorigenesis. As CHD4 is frequently co-mutated with other cancer driver genes such as TP53, PIK3CA, and PTEN, future mouse modeling efforts emulating patient mutational profiles might provide insight into the role of CHD4 in endometrial carcinoma.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

We found that constraints on the fitness seascape are determined by the screened Poisson equation, which also describes the screening of electric fields in media with mobile charge carriers. In our model, changes in mutation frequencies act as \"charges\" that reveal the underlying fitness seascape, which is analogous to an electrostatic potential. After validating our method in simulations, we applied it to study how HIV-1 evolves to escape immune control by T cells within individual hosts.

Bees were trained in a classical olfactory conditioning paradigm and then presented with conditioned stimuli and ambiguous odor mixtures to assess decision-making changes under uncertainty. We additionally measured locomotor performance and ethanol absorption via spectrophotometric analysis of hemolymph. Ethanol levels peaked rapidly and remained elevated for at least two hours post-ingestion. Despite this, ethanol had no detectable effect on CJB responses, memory, or motor behavior.

High production and material costs, complex fabrication methods, reliance on specialized equipment, and persistent issues with sensor stability and reproducibility continue to impede development for PoC use. Addressing these challenges, this study innovates a democratized and cost-effective fabrication kit that enables the production of SERS substrates using commonly available materials and straightforward electrochemistry techniques without compromising on sensitivity and reproducibility. Importantly, this method leverages commercially available bottled water and simple battery-powered fabrication, thereby eliminating reliance on a power grid and enabling the local production of biosensors in resource-restricted and conflict-affected areas. The cost of producing the fabrication kit is $39.54 with raw materials purchased at bulk retail prices, while the cost of consumables for fabricating each test is just 1.33 cents. To ensure real-world feasibility, we conducted a comprehensive reproducibility analysis, where consistent plasmonic enhancement was observed across multiple production batches.

D.; Kasson, P.; Lerch, M. T.", "abstract": "Conformational heterogeneity is integral to protein function - ranging from enzyme catalysis to signal transduction - and visualizing distinct conformational states requires experimental techniques capable of providing such structural information. One particularly powerful method, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, can provide a high-resolution, long-range (~15-80 [A]) probability distributions of distances between site-selected pairs of spin labels to resolve intra-protein distance parameters of unique protein conformations, as well as their respective likelihoods within a conformational ensemble. A current frontier in the field of DEER spectroscopy is utilizing this distance information in computational modeling to generate complete structural models of these multiple conformations. Although several methods have been developed for this purpose, modeling protein backbone structural rearrangements using multiple distance restraints remains challenging, due in part to the complexity provided by rotameric flexibility of the spin label side chain. Here, we overcome these challenges with ProGuide, a new framework for generating accurate structural models guided by DEER distance distribution information. Large conformational rearrangements are captured by performing iterative experimentally biased molecular dynamics simulations. In each iteration, spin-label rotameric heterogeneity is modeled using chiLife, and then C changes are calculated to capture distance-probability density present in the experimental DEER distributions and lacking from the modeled one. The resulting models of this process then go through a selection to generate the ensemble that best recapitulates the DEER data. We illustrate the power of this method using published DEER data from a study of biased agonism in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), a prototypical G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The resulting AT1R models consist of both Gq- and {beta}-arrestin-biased conformations, including a completely novel {beta}-arrestin-biased conformation. These models reveal structural insights involving tertiary structural rearrangements as well as residue-level changes in crucial microswitch motifs.

After the cell division, Golgi organelles assemble from multiple vesicles scattered across daughter cells. These are but two examples of intracellular assembly of vesicles, organelles and chromosomes made possible by dynamic microtubules. The most prominent microtubule networks are centrosome-focused asters that 'search' for the vesicles and chromosomes, but there are also microtubules originating from the vesicles and chromosomes, raising the question whether a coordination between multiple microtubule networks optimizes the assembly process. This study uses a computational model to examine how microtubule dynamics influence the assembly of organelles from vesicles. The model includes two microtubule populations: microtubules anchored to the vesicles, which drive local clustering, and 'central' microtubules anchored to the centrosome that aggregate the vesicles globally. Simulations show that a microtubule decentralization - balanced contribution from both microtubule populations - accelerates the assembly of tens of vesicles, but that assigning all microtubules to hundreds of vesicles optimizes the assembly. Directionally biased microtubule growth, particularly when avoiding spontaneous catastrophe events, further accelerates the assembly. Additionally, microtubule branching, when occurring at optimal angles and spacings, enhances the assembly's efficiency. Lastly, rapid crosslinking of overlapping central and 'local' microtubules can drastically accelerate the assembly. Applying this model to the spindle assembly in early mitosis reveals similar insights. The model suggests that the observed multiple microtubule networks optimize the intracellular assembly processes when molecular resources are limited.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

G.; Salmon, G.; Phillips, R.", "abstract": "Many biological processes can be thought of as the result of an underlying dynamics in which the system repeatedly undergoes distinct and abortive trajectories with the dynamical process only ending when some specific process, purpose, structure or function is achieved. A classic example is the way in which microtubules attach to kinetochores as a prerequisite for chromosome segregation and cell division. In this example, the dynamics is characterized by apparently futile time histories in which microtubules repeatedly grow and shrink without chromosomal attachment. We hypothesize that for biological processes for which it is not the initial conditions that matter, but rather the final state, this kind of exploratory dynamics is biology's unique and necessary solution to achieving these functions with high fidelity. This kind of cause and effect relationship can be contrasted to examples from physics and chemistry where the initial conditions determine the outcome. In this paper, we examine the similarities of many biological processes that depend upon random trajectories starting from the initial state and the selection of subsets of these trajectories to achieve some desired functional final state. We begin by reviewing the long history of the principles of dynamics, first in the context of physics, and then in the context of the study of life. These ideas are then stacked up against the broad categories of biological phenomenology that exhibit exploratory dynamics. We then build on earlier work by making a quantitative examination of a succession of increasingly sophisticated models for exploratory dynamics, all of which share the common feature of being a series of repeated trials that ultimately end in a \"winning\" trajectory. We also explore the ways in which microscopic parameters can be tuned to alter exploratory dynamics as well as the energetic burden of performing such processes.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

F.; Ott, M.; Bathia, T.; Emenecker, R.; Wolff, M.; Thalhammer, A.; Matschi, S.; Villalobos, L. I. A. C.", "abstract": "Auxin is the paragon of small molecules driving recognition of proteins for their ubiquitylation and degradation, enabling rapid decoding of external signals into transcriptional responses. Auxin functions as a molecular glue, enhancing interactions between the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1) and other TIR1-like proteins with various AUXIN INDUCIBLE/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (AUX/IAA) transcriptional repressors. A Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCFTIR1/AFBs, mediates the ubiquitylation and degradation of AUX/IAA proteins by positioning them for ubiquitin transfer, leading to their rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome. AUX/IAAs contain a Phox Bem 1 (PB1) domain, a degron, and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that influence auxin sensing and their polyubiquitylation by interacting with TIR1. However, the precise role of IDRs in AUX/IAA positioning for ubiquitylation, and the mechanism of multisite ubiquitylation within AUX/IAAs remain unclear. We used biophysical techniques and coarse-grained simulations (CGS) to study the structural behavior of IDRs in IAA7, a model AUX/IAA protein from Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings show that IAA7 expands by approximately 2.6 nm upon binding to TIR1 in the presence of auxin, likely increasing the proximity between a lysine acceptor in IAA7 and the active site of the SCFTIR1 E3 ligase for ubiquitylation. Our data also suggest that IAA7 remains conformationally heterogeneous when bound to TIR1, forming numerous transient contacts along its IDRs and C-terminal PB1 with TIR1. We propose that these transient interactions outside the IAA7 degron interface enhance the TIR1-IAA7 association, resulting in highly dynamic and heterogeneous complexes that facilitate IAA7 multisite ubiquitylation, targeting it for rapid proteasomal degradation.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Fueled by photosynthesis, C-assimilation by RUBISCO must be tightly controlled. RUBISCO regulation upon transition from light to darkness is not fully understood in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis). Synechocystis does not have a RUBISCO activase that regulates RUBISCO activity in vascular plants by removing intrinsic sugar phosphate inhibitors from its active site. Instead, the regulatory CP12 protein of Synechocystis inactivates glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH2) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) during darkness. This mechanism indicates metabolic regulation of RUBISCO. We investigated C-assimilation in vivo at the transition to darkness by dynamic 13CO2 labeling experiments. We monitored RUBISCO activity by 13C-incorporation into 1-C position of 3PGA. Other than the wild type, the{Delta} cp12 mutant continued to assimilate 13CO2 into 3PGA in darkness. RUBISCO abundances and specific activities were not altered in{Delta} cp12 and upon light to dark transition. CP12 was required to shut down the CBB cycle during the night. Complementation of{Delta} cp12 by native CP12 ({Delta}cp12::cp12) and CP12 with mutated conserved cysteines in its GAPDH2- and PRK-binding domains ({Delta}cp12::cp12{Delta}Cys) showed that both native binding domains are required to fully inactivate the CBB cycle in the night. RuBP levels were highly elevated in{Delta} cp12 upon transition to darkness. Complementation with mutated and native CP12 variants gradually reduced RuBP to wild type levels and revealed highly significant correlation between RuBP concentration and the time-shifted 13C-uptake into 3PGA. We propose that RUBISCO activity in Synechocystis at day-night transition is regulated through depletion and blocked regeneration of RuBP. 13C-positional analyses of aspartate suggest regeneration of RuBP in{Delta} cp12 via dysregulated gluconeogenesis and the oxidative pentose phosphate path. We demonstrate that RUBISCO activity of Synechocystis is present throughout diurnal growth and depends on the availability of its substrate.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Drought stress and plant parasitic nematodes are among the most damaging stress factors limiting plant growth and production. Plants have developed complex and specific responses to combined biotic and abiotic stresses, which differ from their responses to individual stresses. Therefore, there is an imperative need to understand plant responses to multiple stresses as a central avenue for development of robust plants with the ability to sustain growth and crop production in times of global climate change. RNA-Seq analysis was performed on Arabidopsis plants to investigate the transcriptomic responses to infection with the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and drought stress either individually or concurrently. Arabidopsis plants activated a unique suite of genes in response to the joint stress, which significantly differed from the response to either individual stress. Among these differentially expressed genes, Azelaic Acid Induced 1 (AZI1), small auxin upregulated RNA 71 (SAUR71), and Disease Related Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein 1 (DRN1) may play important roles in plant responses to concurrent drought stress and root-knot nematode infection. The expression of AZI1, which is involved in priming defences via systemic acquired resistance, was uniquely upregulated in Arabidopsis leaves in response to the combined stress. SAUR71, which is a member of the largest family of primary auxin response genes, was induced solely in response to combined stress. In contrast, the expression of DRN1, a member of the non-specific lipid-transfer protein family, was strongly suppressed in Arabidopsis roots by combined drought stress and nematode infection.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Despite extensive research, seed longevity remains one of the fundamental topics in plant biology. Here, we discovered the novel role of carotenoid metabolites in prolonging seed lifespan. We found that phytoene synthase (PSY), the gene encoding a major rate-limiting enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis, modulated seed storability in Arabidopsis under both natural and artificial aging conditions. Seeds from the PSY overexpression (OE) lines exhibited significantly enhanced lifespan with low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a major factor affecting longevity, whereas those from the psy mutants had decreased viability with high ROS levels. While lutein and beta-carotene were detected in seeds, only beta-carotene and its derived apocarotenoids, i.e. beta-cyclocitral and beta-ionone, were found to improve seed lifespan. Notably, the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 and 4 (ccd1 ccd4) double mutant and PSY ccd1 ccd4 seeds showed significantly reduced seed longevity, indicating that beta-carotene cleavage is necessary for or it is apocarotenoids playing the role in preserving seed lifespan. Comparative proteomic analysis identified TIP2;2, an aquaporin protein, which showed differential abundances in seeds of PSY OE and psy mutant vs wild type. The mutant tip2;2 had reduced seed longevity, and its promoter was transactivated by apocarotenoids. Collectively, this study uncovers a novel role of apocarotenoids in protecting seed longevity and highlights the importance of seed carotenoid production in strengthening agriculture.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

While tremendous diversification of plant natural product pathways is well documented, how the upstream primary metabolism evolved in coordination with the lineage-specific pathways remain poorly understood. Here we studied the evolution of aromatic amino acid (AAA) biosynthesis during the emergence of tyrosine-derived lignin pathway uniquely found in grasses and closely related Poales. Phylogeny-guided in vitro and in planta functional analyses were conducted on two key regulatory enzymes, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DHS) and arogenate dehydrogenase (TyrA), catalyzing the first and last steps of AAA and tyrosine biosynthesis, respectively. Deregulated TyrAs were broadly present across Poales, with PACMAD grasses exhibiting stronger deregulation, suggesting that the active tyrosine biosynthesis likely emerged before, but were also selected upon, the evolution of tyrosine-lignin pathway. Conversely, DHS deregulation occurred more recently within BOP grasses after the emergence of tyrosine-lignin pathway, via multiple mutations that acted synergistically in the allosteric regulatory domain of the enzyme. The study highlights how the regulation of upstream primary metabolism is dynamically tuned both before and after the evolution of emerging natural product pathways.

Tauopathy patients also experience disruptions to circadian rhythms of behavior and sleep. The connection between tau pathology and circadian dysfunction is not well understood, especially regarding the role of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's central circadian pacemaker. Here, we conducted histological and functional analyses of the SCN in the PS19 (Prnp-huMAPT*P301S) mouse model of tauopathy. The SCN of PS19 mice had accumulation of phosphorylated tau as early as 2 months of age, and tau pathology was detected in both major neuronal subpopulations of the SCN: VIPergic (core) and AVPergic (shell) neurons. To assess SCN timing and entrainment properties, daily locomotor activity was monitored in PS19 and wild-type (WT) mice from 3 to 11 months-of-age. Activity profiles, rates of re-entrainment to changes in the light/dark cycle, and intrinsic circadian timing properties were unchanged in PS19 mice compared to age-matched WT mice. Finally, profiling circadian gene expression in tau fibril-seeded SCN explants from PS19 and WT mice did not detect differences in network-level oscillator properties. Together, these findings suggest that tau pathology within the SCN is not sufficient to trigger marked disruptions of core circadian timing mechanisms in this tauopathy model. Further, these results raise the possibility that circadian disruptions in tauopathies arise from dysfunction in SCN-gated output pathways or downstream clock-gated circuits rather than the SCN oscillator itself.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

While somatotopic protomaps are already developed in the primary somatosensory and motor cortices in late pregnancy, little is known about the anatomical substrates of this functional specialization. In this study, we aimed to decipher the microstructural properties of these regions in the developing brain. Using advanced diffusion MRI and post-processing tools, we parcellated the pre- and post-central gyri into microstructurally distinct clusters along the lateral-to-medial axis in full-term neonates, confirming the early differentiation within sensorimotor regions. These clusters were further analyzed in preterm infants scanned near birth and at term-equivalent age (TEA), compared with another group of full-term neonates. Applying a multivariate Mahalanobis distance approach, we quantified deviations in preterm cortical microstructure relative to the full-term reference. Preterm infants showed significant region- and position-specific deviations at both ages, though these were smaller at TEA, consistently with ongoing maturation during the pre-term period. Differences between the pre- and post-central gyri, and along the somatotopic axis, suggested differential vulnerability to prematurity. In particular, the motor regions appeared to be at a more advanced stage of maturation close to birth and less vulnerable at TEA than somatosensory regions. An opposite trend was observed for lateral positions related to mouth representation compared with intermediary and medial positions. These findings support the notion that early sensorimotor cortical specialization is microstructurally emergent during gestation and sensitive to atypical developmental context of preterm birth.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Collective neuronal activities, such as neural avalanches and synchronized oscillations, are also found under rest conditions, and these features have been suggested to support sensory processing, brain readiness for rapid responses, and computational efficiency. The rat barrel cortex and thalamus circuit, with its somatotopic organization for processing whisker movements, provides a powerful system to explore such interplay. To characterize these resting state circuits, we perform simultaneous multi-electrode recordings in rats' barrel cortex and thalamus. During spontaneous activity, oscillations with frequencies centered around 11.5 Hz are detected concomitantly with slow oscillations below 4 Hz, as well as power-law distributed avalanches. The phase of the lower-frequency oscillation appears to modulate the higher-frequency amplitude, and it has a role in gating avalanche occurrences. We then record neural activity during controlled whisker movements to confirm that the 11.5 Hz barrel circuit active at rest is indeed the one involved in response to whisker stimulation. We finally show how a thalamic-driven firing-rate model can describe the entire phenomenology observed at resting state and predict the response of the barrel cortex to controlled whisker movement.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Methods: A total of 601 individuals were included (342 people with MS-PwMS from two cohorts, and 259 healthy controls-HC). Radiomic features (RF) and volumes were extracted from the whole thalamus, five thalamic nuclei, and the putamen segmented on 3D T1-weighted images. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) in PwMS, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) in HC. In the first MS cohort, multivariate linear regression in a discovery set (N=103) identified thalamus-derived RF associated with SDMT, which were retested in a replication set (N=63). Their associations with PASAT in a second MS cohort (N=176) and DSST in HC were also evaluated. We then tested whether the same RF, when extracted from the putamen, were associated with SDMT.

The optimization of the nanoplatform in terms of lipid composition, functionalized silica dendritic core formation, and final charge, as well as their compatibility with the complex loading profile highlights an opportunity for enhanced survival of mice with advanced ovarian cancer compared to monotherapy. Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration led to preferential accumulation within tumor-burdened tissues with selective accumulation in myeloid cells. High myeloid cell cytotoxicity negated the benefits of oxaliplatin. The inclusion of CpG in the nanoparticle formulation enhanced the survival of mice with ovarian cancer.

Capillary malformations (CMs) typically present as port-wine stains in the skin and can also affect ocular and cerebral tissues in Sturge Weber Syndrome (SWS), leading to aesthetic, ophthalmic, and neurological complications. CMs are caused by a somatic mutation in the GNAQ gene in endothelial cells, leading to a p.R183Q substitution in the Gq protein. The underlying mechanisms of Gq-R183Q-driven CMs formation remain unclear. To address this, we generated CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human dermal microvascular endothelial cells lacking endogenous Gq, whilst expressing the Gq-R183Q mutant instead. The Gq-R183Q mutation strongly impaired endothelial cell migration and angiogenic sprouting capacity compared to wild-type controls. Next, using SILAC-based quantitative proteomics, we investigated the Gq-R183Q-induced changes in the endothelial phosphoproteome. These analyses revealed prominent activation of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway in Gq-R183Q-expressing endothelial cells, leading to dephosphorylation of NFAT1 and NFAT2 and the selective expression of their transcriptional target DSCR1.4. Immunofluorescence of patient-derived skin biopsies confirmed deregulation of NFAT1/2 and the expression of DSRC1 in endothelial cells, validating their potential importance in CMs. We further demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin with tacrolimus (FK506) could partially restore NFAT signaling in Gq-R183Q endothelial cells. Intriguingly, the genetic depletion of the NFAT target DSCR1 in Gq-R183Q cells fully restored calcineurin/NFAT signaling to normal levels, enabling proper endothelial migration and sprouting. In summary, we uncovered a calcineurin-NFAT-DSCR1.4 signal transduction axis that is driven by Gq-R183Q and established its importance for endothelial angiogenic properties.

In this study, we examine the behavior of female and male nuclei during sexual reproduction in the model fungus Podospora anserina. After plasmogamy, the two types of nuclei do not immediately undergo karyogamy. Instead, once inside the trichogyne (the female-specific hyphae extending from the ascogonium) the male nuclei migrate over distances of up to several hundred micrometers from the trichogyne tip, where plasmogamy occurs, to the ascogonium at the center of the protoperithecium. Our study highlights the contrasting behaviors of the two nuclear types: female nuclei remain immobile and spherical, while male nuclei move rapidly and exhibit striking deformations and stretching. Trichogynes are branched and compartmentalized, consisting of articles separated by septa that communicate through the septal pores. We show that during their migration across these compartments, male nuclei undergo the most extreme movements, deformations, and speeds reported to date for nuclei in motion. We also investigated the role of the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons in male nuclei behavior. Both cytoskeletal networks are highly dynamic and abundant in trichogynes, particularly at septa. We demonstrate that while actin depolymerization does not impair male nuclei migration, MT disruption causes a complete arrest of both nuclear movement and stretching, indicating a critical role for MTs.

We describe a novel mechanism whereby JIP4 regulates lysosomal cystine storage by controlling the abundance of cystinosin (CTNS), the transporter responsible for lysosomal cystine efflux. To this end, JIP4, previously characterized as a motor adaptor and kinase signaling scaffold, suppresses TMEM55B-dependent ubiquitylation of CTNS. Loss of JIP4 reduces CTNS protein levels, leading to lysosomal cystine accumulation and lysosomal storage defects that phenocopy loss of CTNS in both human cells and the renal proximal tubules of JIP4 knockout mice. These phenotypes mirror cystinosis, the lysosomal storage disease caused by CTNS loss-of-function. Our findings thus reveal a fundamental process that controls the efflux of lysosomal cystine and has relevance to understanding human disease arising from JIP4 mutations.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Dysregulation of this transient wound-induced senescence-like response can result in impaired healing outcomes. Given the established age-related decline in tissue regenerative capacity, we hypothesized that alterations in this senescence response contribute to the delayed healing of cutaneous wounds in aged individuals. Our investigation demonstrated a significant delay in the closure of full-thickness dorsal skin wounds in aged mice compared to their young counterparts. Analysis of the wound microenvironment revealed a transient upregulation of senescence-associated markers (p16, p21, senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors in the wound tissue of young mice, a response that was markedly attenuated in aged mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of all cells isolated from day 6 wounds identified a distinct population of p16+/p21+/Ki67- senescent fibroblasts in young mice, characterized by a transcriptional signature indicative of pro-healing extracellular matrix production, a finding corroborated in human wound tissue from young donors. Crucially, in aged wounds, we observed a lower quantity of these senescent cells, a deficit compounded by a qualitative, age-dependent shift in their function, moving away from beneficial extracellular matrix remodeling towards a more detrimental pro-inflammatory state, which ultimately can contribute to the delayed wound healing.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify and characterize a previously unrecognized population of early hepatoblasts at the ventroposterior part of the emerging liver bud, traced from Cdx2-positive endoderm progenitors, which we term primitive hepatoblasts. Mouse and human single-cell transcriptomics reveals the expression of both canonical hepatoblast markers TBX3, FGB, and KRT8/18 and primitive-specific mesenchymal markers ID3, VIM, and GATA4. Lineage tracing revealed the notable contribution up to 12.6% of LIV2+ hepatoblasts at E11.5 but diminishes in late fetal and postnatal development. Epigenetic and functional perturbation studies further uncover that primitive hepatoblast emergence is primed by WNT-suppression on RA-permissive CDX2+FOXA2+ progenitors. Furthermore, human pluripotent stem cell-derived primitive hepatoblast-like cells secrete pleiotrophin and midkine to amplify hepatoblast populations and develop epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid tissues in vivo.

Yet, ethanol traces can also be detected in the crop of caged bees with no access to environmental food sources. This raises the possibility that endogenous ethanol accumulation could occur under restricted conditions, with microbial contributions as a potential mechanism. The crop microbiota, although less diverse than that in other gut segments, plays important roles in food fermentation and pathogen defense. We hypothesized that captivity-induced shifts in crop microbiota may facilitate fermentation, resulting in measurable ethanol. To test this, we compared the crop contents of naturally foraging hive bees and caged bees reared without access to the natural environment. Ethanol levels were low in both groups and did not differ significantly, but non-zero measurements were more frequently observed in caged bees. Microbial community structure differed strongly in - and {beta}-diversity. Caged bees showed reduced abundance of nectar-associated genera (e.g., Apilactobacillus) and an increase in genera that include known ethanol-producing strains, such as Gilliamella and Bifidobacterium. While we did not directly assess metabolic activity, our results suggest that captivity alters microbial communities in ways that may influence ethanol levels.

It is determined by the specific localisation of sperm chromosomal regions carrying genes with expression crucial at the first contact with ooplasm during fertilization. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether the application of selective methods providing high-quality spermatozoa with good motility and/or morphology, may increase the frequency of gametes with the specific positioning of chromosomes. For the first time we have used the sequential staining algorithm for consecutive analyses of the same individual sperm cells with a fixed position, what enables to achieve a full and detailed documentation at the single cell level. Methods: Semen samples from 5 normozoospermic males were collected and processed for fractionation via swim up (to select viable and motile spermatozoa) or Percoll density gradient (90/47%; for good sperm motility and morphology). Sperm chromatin protamination was assessed by aniline blue (AB) staining, while DNA fragmentation by acridine orange (AO) (ssDNA fragmentation) or TUNEL assay (ssDNA and dsDNA fragmentation). Then, sequential staining and analyses of the same individual sperm cell with a fixed position on a slide were performed, in the following order: (i) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for determination of positioning of chromosomal centromeres: 4, 7, 8, 9, 18, X and Y, with so-called: linear and radial estimations applied, followed by distance measurements between selected pairs of chromosomes; and (ii) immunofluorescent (IF) measurement of global sperm DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) levels, what added additional data about epigenetic layer of the sperm chromosomes positioning. Results: Our study demonstrated that high-quality sperm selection methods significantly: (i) increased frequency of spermatozoa with good chromatin protamination (+~25%) and 5mC and 5hmC DNA levels (+~9.5%), and (ii) reduced rate of spermatozoa with ssDNA fragmentation (-~65%). Motile and morphologically normal spermatozoa showed distinct chromosome repositioning with sex chromosomes shifted to the nuclear periphery, a key chromosomal region of the initial interaction with the ooplasm during fertilization process. Evaluated autosomes revealed various patterns of repositioning.

We present a tunable, primary rat-derived lung organoid model that systematically varies immune, epithelial, and mesenchymal inputs to reveal how composition alone dictates epithelial plasticity and macrophage polarization. Across conditions, we observed the spontaneous emergence of disease-relevant transitional cell states, including Sox9+ stressed progenitors, RAS/AT0-like intermediates, and hillock-like cells, alongside distinct macrophage activation profiles. In mesenchyme-rich contexts, epithelial-immune-mesenchymal crosstalk appeared to reinforce inflammatory signaling and stabilize transitional persistence, while immune-dominant inputs favored ATI-like repair and squamous remodeling. Notably, hillock-like cells displayed context-specific polarization and expressed immune-regulatory genes, suggesting a role as epithelial orchestrators that help calibrate inflammatory response during regeneration. Connectomic analysis revealed that regenerative outcomes were associated with dynamic multicellular signaling networks that integrate stress sensing, immune coordination, and epithelial fate. This platform provides a tractable system for modeling context-specific repair and regenerative mechanisms and could inform therapeutic strategies aimed at redirecting epithelial fate in chronic lung disease.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

While autologous skin grafting is considered the gold standard for treating burns, its widespread use is limited due to donor site morbidity and the requirement for large amounts of tissue. Traditional wound dressings and treatments often fail to ensure complete recovery. Being initially FDA-approved to treat multiple sclerosis, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) has also been shown to accelerate burn wound closure by transforming keratinocytes and fibroblasts when administered systemically. However, prolonged systemic use of 4-AP can lead to significant side effects. In this study, we aimed to repurpose 4-AP for treating skin burn wounds by delivering it topically using a laponite-gelatin gel formulation. This method allows for non-invasive and localized drug delivery on burn wound site. We evaluated the physical properties of the 4-AP gel shear thinning behavior, drug release kinetics, biocompatibility, and functional wound closure using a scratch assay. Moreover, our in vivo experiments showed that the 4-AP loaded gel accelerates wound healing by enhancing re-epithelialization and hair follicle regeneration and promoting fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation, which supports extracellular matrix remodeling after skin burns. This novel application of the 4-AP gel could offer a promising alternative to current burn wound therapies, potentially leading to improved outcomes for burn patients.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Semi-supervised strategies such as PLIER have improved interpretability by integrating pathway annotations during latent variable extraction, yet the original PLIER implementation is prohibitively slow and memory-intensive, making it impractical for modern large-scale resources like ARCHS4 or recount3. Here, we introduce PLIERv2, which overcomes these constraints through a two-phase algorithmic design (an unsupervised \"PLIERbase\" initialization followed by a \"PLIERfull\" regression that incorporates priors via glmnet), rigorous internal cross-validation to tune regularization parameters for each latent variable, and efficient on-disk data handling using memory-mapped matrices from the bigstatsr package. Benchmarking on GTEx, recount2, and ARCHS4 demonstrates that PLIERv2 achieves 7x-41x speedups over PLIERv1, succeeds in modeling hundreds of thousands of samples that PLIERv1 cannot handle, and maintains or improves biological specificity of latent variables as shown by tissue-alignment and pathway enrichment analyses.

Mouse models have been indispensable in advancing our understanding of infectious diseases caused by intestinal pathogens and in identifying physical, chemical and immunological barriers that limit these infections. However, there are significant differences between laboratory mice and human intestinal microbiota and immunobiology that underscore the need to develop other models that recapitulate the disease pathology and mucosal immune responses of human enteric diseases. Here we report how the pathogenic expansion of Citrobacter braakii in naked mole rats (NMRs) leads to colonic inflammation and epithelial injury that mimics pathological features of human hemorrhagic colitis. We observe mucosal erosions, ulcerations, depletion of goblet cells, extension of proliferative compartments to the surface of the glands, and active inflammation in the colonic lamina propria of infected NMRs. Without intervention, systemic inflammation associated with sepsis ensues in infected NMRs and results in high mortality. Interestingly, we demonstrate a strong therapeutic effect of probiotics comprising Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus salvarius subsp. thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium strains. Treatment with probiotics induces mucosal healing and restores intestinal homeostasis, including suppression of excessive proliferation of epithelial cells, replenishment of goblet cells and also has an anti-inflammatory effect. Taken together, we demonstrate that NMRs, beyond their use as an anti-ageing and disease-resistance model, can also be used to address disease mechanisms underlying infectious colitis, including disruptions in the mucosal barrier permeability, gut microbial ecology and in local and systemic immune regulation; and in testing functional probiotics strains as potential therapeutics.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

(RMSD, 1.44 W*kg-1)), HTK (1.30 W*kg-1)), and RE3 (1.27 W*kg-1)) equations but much worse for the ACSM equation (1.82 W*kg-1)). Agreement on uphill slopes was highest for the HTK (RMSD, 1.45 W*kg-1)) and RE3 (1.41 W*kg-1)) equations with less precision noted for the ACSM (2.17 W*kg-1)) and Minetti et al. (2.18 W*kg-1)) equations. When estimating [M] during downhill running, the RE3 equation performed marginally better (RMSD, 1.45 W*kg-1) than the Minetti et al. equation (1.57 W*kg-1). Conclusion: The improved RE3 and HTK equations estimate metabolic rates during level and graded running with improved accuracy and precision.

While calorie restriction (CR) initiated early in life improves metabolic health and preserves beta cell function, its impact when initiated later in life remains unclear. We implemented a two-month, 20% CR intervention in 72-week-old male mice and assessed in vivo glucose homeostasis and beta cell function using meal tolerance tests, single cell RNA-sequencing, and confocal microscopy. We found that old mice exposed to CR have significantly improved glucose tolerance due to higher insulin sensitivity, which drives a two-fold reduction in glucose-stimulated beta cell insulin secretion. At the molecular level, CR enhanced beta cell proteostasis by downregulating ER stress pathways. Remarkably, CR reprogrammed the alpha cell transcriptome to suppress antigen presentation pathways and cytokine signaling pathways, including major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) signaling. These transcriptional changes correlated with profound reduction in the density of adaptive immune cells in aging islets, including a near-complete loss of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells due to weakened intercellular communication between antigen-presenting cells with T and B lymphocytes. Importantly, aging human alpha cells from non-diabetic donors display similar proinflammatory phenotypes, including higher expression of MHC-I antigens that correlates with higher density of Cd8+ cells in aging human pancreases. Together, these findings demonstrate that CR remodels aging alpha and beta cell structure-function to modulate immune cell interactions in aging pancreases to mitigate age-related immune activation and islet inflammation.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

A.; Hatzikirou, H.", "abstract": "Biomedical systems inherently exhibit multi-scale dynamics, making accurate system identification particularly challenging due to the complexity of capturing a wide time scale spectrum. Traditional methods capable of addressing this issue rely on explicit equations, limiting their applicability in cases where only observational data are available. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method, the multi scale analysis algorithm Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). This framework allows the partition of the available dataset in subsets characterized by similar dynamics, so that system identification can proceed within these subsets without facing a wide time scale spectrum. Accordingly, when the full dataset does not allow SINDy to identify the proper model, CSP is employed for the generation of subsets of similar dynamics, which are then fed into SINDy. CSP requires the availability of the gradient of the vector field, which is estimated by the NNs. The framework is tested on the Michaelis-Menten model, for which various reduced models in analytic form exist at different parts of the phase space. It is demonstrated that the CSP-based data subsets allow SINDy to identify the proper reduced model in cases where the full dataset does not. In addition, it is demonstrated that the framework succeeds even in the cases where the available data set originates from stochastic versions of the Michaelis-Menten model. This framework is algorithmic, so system identification is not hindered by the dimensions of the dataset.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Visceral pain is a cardinal symptom of many disorders affecting the gut. Modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) such as benzodiazepines may attenuate colonic pain but the specific contribution of peripheral GABAA receptors remains unclear as these agents have prominent central effects. Methods. Using medicinal chemistry optimization of the benzodiazepine scaffold, we developed a novel and potent benzodiazepine-based positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GABAA receptors, Li633, with no significant central nervous system (CNS) penetration. Results. The locomotor activity of rats placed in an open field was unchanged with Li633 at doses up to 30 mg/kg, confirming its lack of a CNS effect. LI-633 produced robust potentiation of GABA-induced inward current, with EC50 values ranging from 8 nM (5{beta}2{gamma}2) to 128 nM (3{beta}2{gamma}2). In vitro electrophysiological studies confirmed its ability to reduce excitability of human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. LI-633 potentiated muscimol-induced GABAergic currents in rat DRG neurons in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 70.4 nM. In vivo, LI-633 significantly attenuated visceral hypersensitivity and pain behavior in a rat model of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). In the IBS model, administration of the drug also resulted in decreased excitability of colon-specific DRG neurons and significantly reduced the colonic afferent response to balloon distention as measured by recordings of neural activity in dorsal ganglia rootlets. Conclusions. These findings highlight the potential of targeting peripheral GABAA receptors for pain management in IBS and other disorders associated with visceral hypersensitivity.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

However, when released into the environment, they can degrade into very small particles, forming micro- and nanoplastic particles (MNP). This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized the evidence from controlled preclinical studies to investigate the neurological effects of MNPs in fish. Following a pre-registered protocol, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies exposing fish to virgin MNPs under controlled conditions, reporting behavioral or neurochemical outcomes relevant to central nervous system function. Data were synthesized using a hierarchical random-effects model with robust variance estimation. Fifty-nine studies, comprising 723 comparisons across 13 behavioral and neurochemical outcomes, were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis accounted for correlated effect sizes within shared control groups; and nested identifiers for study, control group, and effect size. Results indicated high heterogeneity and no consistent effect of the MNP exposure on behavioral or neurochemical parameters, except for reduced traveled distance in sensory-motor assays. Meta-regression examined whether developmental stage, exposure duration, and MNP size or concentration moderate these effects. No significant moderators were identified, except for catalase activity, where longer exposure reduced enzyme activity in larvae. The findings should be interpreted with caution, as reporting quality was generally low, with key methodological details often omitted. Additionally, publication bias was found for several outcomes, and influential case analyses revealed that a few studies disproportionately affected the overall estimates. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of MNPs on fish neurobiology and behavior.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

The extent to which neuroanatomical alterations in MDD and PTSD are attributable to CM, however, is uncertain. Here, we analyzed CM and 3D structural brain MRI data from 3,711 participants in the ENIGMA MDD and PTSD Working Groups (25 sites; 33.3+/-13.0 years; 59.9% female). Normative modeling estimated deviation z-scores for 14 subcortical volumes (SV), 68 cortical thickness (CT), and 68 surface area (SA) measures, capturing differences from population norms. Transdiagnostic associations between CM and brain deviation scores were evaluated within each sex and age cohort. In young adults (ages 18-35), abuse was associated with larger volumes in thalamus and pallidum, thinner isthmus cingulate and middle frontal regions, and thicker medial orbitofrontal cortex; there were no significant effects in pediatric ([&le;]18 years) participants. The strongest effects were observed in young female adults (|{beta}|=.07-.22, q<.05): greater abuse and neglect were correlated with smaller hippocampus and putamen volumes, thinner entorhinal cortex, and smaller SA in fusiform/inferior parietal regions, and with larger SA in orbitofrontal and occipital cortices. In males, abuse had widespread effects on CT and SA (|{beta}|=.1-.18, q<.05); effects for neglect were minimal.

We now understand that symptoms and neural changes may overlap across EP diagnostic categories. However, the relationship between RSFC patterns and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions remains poorly understood. Methods: We employed Partial Least Squares correlation to examine multivariate relationships between whole-brain RSFC and clinical symptoms in 124 EP patients (aged 16-35 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a psychotic mood disorder. RSFC was computed among 216 cortical and subcortical regions. Clinical assessment included 41 symptom measures spanning positive, negative, general psychopathology, and manic dimensions. Results: Analysis revealed one significant latent component (p<0.001) capturing 41.6% of the RSFC-symptom covariance. This component was characterized by increased between-network connectivity, particularly involving sensory-motor, default mode, and subcortical regions including the amygdala and thalamus. The associated symptom profile included cognitive rigidity and arousal dysregulation (stereotyped thinking, anxiety, and somatic concerns), rather than traditional positive or negative symptoms. This brain-behavior relationship was consistent across diagnoses and independent of medication and substance use. The clinical relevance was validated through significant correlations with standardized measures of hostility (r=0.23), negative affect (r=0.25), and perceived stress (r=0.22). Conclusions: Our findings reveal a distinct transdiagnostic phenotype in EP characterized by cognitive inflexibility and arousal dysregulation that is associated with altered integration between sensory, default mode, and subcortical networks. This work suggests that specific patterns of network-level functional connectivity may relate to symptom dimensions that cut across conventional diagnostic boundaries, potentially informing more targeted therapeutic approaches.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

K.; Liang, K. X.", "abstract": "Background: Mutations in the POLG gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, are the most common cause of mitochondrial diseases affecting the central nervous system. These mutations frequently result in neurodevelopmental disorders, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying POLG related encephalopathies remain poorly understood. In particular, how POLG mutations affect mitochondrial function, neural progenitor behavior, and early neurogenesis in the developing human brain has not been fully elucidated. Methods: To investigate the impact of POLG mutations on human neurodevelopment, we generated 3D cortical brain organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a patient carrying compound heterozygous POLG mutations (A467T/W748S). Organoid development was monitored using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and live-cell mitochondrial assays. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to profile cellular diversity and transcriptional changes. Organoids were treated with metformin, a known mitochondrial modulator, and mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring membrane potential (TMRE), ATP production, and mtDNA copy number. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to investigate AMPK/SIRT3/mTOR signaling and markers of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t-tests or ANOVA, with p-values < 0.05 considered significant. Results: POLG mutant cortical organoids exhibited impaired neural differentiation, with expansion of stress-associated neural progenitors and reduced neuronal populations. scRNA seq analysis revealed transcriptional signatures of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and suppressed neurogenesis, particularly in a specific neural progenitor subpopulation. Metformin treatment significantly improved mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP output, and mtDNA copy number in POLG organoids. It also promoted neuronal differentiation and reduced reactive progenitor states. Mechanistically, metformin activated AMPK and SIRT3, inhibited mTOR, enhanced expression of mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis markers (OPA1, PGC-1), and increased autophagic and mitophagic activity (LC3B, BNIP3). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that POLG mutations disrupt early cortical development by impairing mitochondrial function and skewing progenitor fate. Metformin mitigates these effects by restoring mitochondrial homeostasis and promoting neurogenesis through the AMPK/SIRT3/mTOR axis. These findings offer mechanistic insights into POLG-related encephalopathy and support metformin as a candidate for therapeutic intervention in mitochondrial neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Hippocampal structure and function are particularly vulnerable, yet the extent to which they are associated with air pollution in children remains unclear. We therefore conducted multi-pollutant mixture analyses to examine how air pollution influences hippocampal architecture and memory performance in late childhood. Methods: We used partial least squares correlation to explore cross-sectional associations between fifteen PM2.5 components, six PM2.5 source factors, NO2, and ozone exposures, and measures of hippocampal microstructure and volume in children aged 9-11 years (n = 7,940) We adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and neuroimaging confounds. We also tested whether air pollutants were associated with hippocampal-dependent list-learning memory performance to examine functional implications of air pollution exposure. Shared variance refers to the proportion of total covariance between variable sets captured by each latent dimension in the multivariate relationship. Findings: In the first latent dimension, greater exposure to organic carbon and ozone was associated with differential hippocampal diffusion (72% of shared variance), whereas the second latent dimension linked elemental carbon and iron to hippocampal diffusion (24% of shared variance). Source-based analyses identified biomass burning and traffic pollution as key contributors (61% and 32% variance, respectively). Volumetric analyses revealed higher copper and zinc exposure correlated with smaller hippocampal subregion volumes (left head, right body, tail; 77% variance), whereas lower nickel levels correlated with smaller right head volume (12% variance). Higher industrial and traffic pollutants were also associated with smaller hippocampal volumes (75% variance). We found two latent dimensions (67% and 23% variance, respectively) showing poorer learning, immediate recall, and mnemonic interference performance linked to higher calcium, elemental carbon, and zinc, and organic carbon, alongside lower copper exposure. Finally, hippocampal diffusion (higher free water/lower hindered extracellular diffusion; 83% variance) and smaller tail volumes (96% variance) were linked to poorer RAVLT recall. Interpretation: These results underscore the complex relationship between air pollution exposure and hippocampal architecture and cautions that such structural changes may either presage or reflect subtle differences in neurocomputational mechanisms associated with learning and memory performance in children.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

In vivo, modECM-rich zones sustain T cell infiltration and KRT14 epithelial cell emergence from Lgr5 progenitors.

To understand how HEB and Id3 regulate {gamma}{delta}T17 cell development, we conducted single cell RNA-sequencing on fetal thymic {gamma}{delta} T cells from Tcf12-deficient mice. {gamma}{delta} T cells lacking HEB exhibited profound alterations in the expression of the genes encoding the TCR{gamma} and TCR{delta} chains, accompanied by a decrease in expression of genes in the early {gamma}{delta} T cell specification network. Surprisingly, Id3 was among the most severely decreased genes in HEB-deficient {gamma}{delta} T cell precursors, suggesting a requirement for HEB in Id3 expression. Analysis of fetal thymic {gamma}{delta} T cells in Id3-deficient mice revealed that the TCR{gamma} and TCR{delta} repertoires were unaffected, and expression of early {gamma}{delta} T cell genes was unperturbed.

People with CF (pwCF) are prone to develop infections by opportunistic pathogens, including Burkholderia cenocepacia, leading to chronic inflammation and lung function loss. Neutrophils, the most abundant cells in the chronically inflamed lungs of pwCF, release granular proteins and oxida-tive products that contribute to tissue damage. The CFTR modulators are a new treat-ment for pwCF aiming to correct the subcellular location and function of the CFTR ion channel. The triple modulator combination of Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor, and Ivacaftor (ETI) or Trikafta(R) has significantly improved clinical symptoms and overall provided a better quality of life for pwCF. The mechanism by which the CFTR modulators help to restore the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils is unknown. The present study demonstrates that neutrophils functionally express CFTR and reveals how ETI modi-fies subcellular CFTR trafficking in CF neutrophils. In addition, ETI treatment reduces intracellular chloride levels in human neutrophils, indicating activation of CFTR-dependent chloride efflux (outflow). Finally, ETI treatment also re-established the intra-cellular antimicrobial killing of CF neutrophils by potentiating NADPH oxidase activity and producing Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs).

The study assessed the long-term fate and immunity of animals recovering from a moderately virulent ASFV infection, following the principles of a duration of immunity study for live vaccines. Pigs inoculated with the moderately virulent ASFV strain 'Estonia14' largely developed mild clinical signs and only transient viremia. Six months after the initial inoculation and once fully recovered, all the animals were challenged with highly virulent ASFV 'Armenia08'. Only one of the previously exposed pigs exhibited mild clinical signs, while all control animals showed typical signs of acute, lethal ASF. Moreover, only a subset of pigs inoculated with the ASF strain 'Estonia14' displayed temporary detectability of ASFV genomes following challenge infection. Virus isolation corroborated these findings, with low levels of infectious virus in organs of previously inoculated pigs (28 days post challenge). Furthermore, monitoring of IgM and IgG kinetics enabled the analysis of humoral responses. IgG levels were sustained over the study period and increased slightly upon challenge infection. Lastly, plasma analysis revealed elevated complement factor C3a levels post inoculation and challenge in the recovered pigs, directly correlating with challenge virus presence. In contrast, both C3a and C5a levels were increased in the control group. It could be shown that complement system activation was mediated by the lectin pathway, possibly by interaction of mannose-binding lectins and ASFV particles. This study suggests that protective immunity following recovery can last at least six months. No cases of persistent or chronic disease were observed in convalescent pigs.

Markers were uniformly distributed across all 17 chromosomes, each containing between 60-230 informative SNPs. The panel was further evaluated on 174 diverse germplasm accessions from 20 Malus species. It exhibited strong cross-species transferability, exceptionally low rates of missing data (<0.5%), and clear genetic differentiation between wild and domesticated accessions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a major locus on chromosome 4 significantly linked to fruit length, weight, and width in addition to trait-specific associations on chromosomes 1, 6, 9, and 11. The cost-effectiveness of genotyping per sample (<$15), combined with these results, underscore the panel's broad utility for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in bi-parental and diverse populations, marker-assisted selection in the breeding programs, and genetic diversity analysis across the Malus genus.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

To overcome these challenges, we developed EliteMHCII, a high-throughput immunopeptidome profiling platform that identifies antigen-derived MHC II epitopes and measures peptide binding affinity across 24 globally common MHC II alleles. Using EliteMHCII, we assessed the immunodominant epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein.

To identify determinants of early treatment response to induction chemotherapy, we analysed 465 KMT2Ar B-ALL cases spanning a wide age range (1 month to 89 years) by integrating transcriptomic and genomic profiling with functional drug response and measurable residual disease (MRD) kinetics. We observed a strong inverse correlation between MRD clearance with advancing age (p=2.1E-04), proximity to early B-cell-precursor developmental state (low maturity score, p=1.3E-03) and AFF1 as fusion partner (p=7.0E-04). A combined model confirmed the predominate impact of both maturity and KMT2A fusion partner on MRD response, supporting the concept that the cells developmental state defines therapy response. Gene expression analysis identified cellular traits that relate to MRD response (e.g. chromatin organization, immune modulation and proliferation). This gene expression classifier grouped cases by MRD response but also by ex-vivo induction chemotherapy sensitivity. Notably, good responders to ex-vivo induction chemotherapy were characterized by a higher maturity score (p=1.8E-03), whereas less mature KMT2Ar B-ALL cases ex-vivo drug response profiles showed higher Venetoclax sensitivity.

Here, we developed a standardized analysis pipeline that combines depth-aligned synaptic mapping, perspective and logarithmic transformations, and multivariate behavioral profiling. Applying this approach to a prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure model of ASD, we identified depth-specific disruptions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic organization within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), alongside impairments in social behavior. Principal component analysis (PCA) integrating synaptic and behavioral parameters revealed convergent abnormalities that robustly distinguished VPA-exposed mice from wild-type (WT) controls.

We used the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) to deliver rmTBI or sham (control) treatment to 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice (n=19). One month post-injury, we implanted electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) electrodes, recorded for 72 hours, and then collected brain tissue and blood plasma. Our assessment of sleep architecture showed that time spent in vigilance state was not affected by the rmTBI one month post-injury; however, power spectra analysis showed a statistically significant shift towards higher frequencies in the rmTBI group during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Epileptiform activity did not differ between sham and rmTBI. Compared to sham controls, the rmTBI group showed higher neurofilament light (NF-L), but not glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in blood plasma and no change in amyloid pathology. These results indicate sustained neurological injury in the APP/PS1 mice one month after rmTBI without affecting amyloid deposition in the brain.

Here, we present a forecasting framework that takes as input a DNA copy number profile and predicts whether the tumour will acquire an oncogene amplification or tumour suppressor deletion in the future. This framework leverages mutation rate estimates from the input tumour, alongside gene-specific selection coefficients derived from a large cohort of 7,880 tumours. We demonstrate feasibility using 7,042 single-time-point samples and longitudinally collected tumour pairs from 44 prostate and 100 lung cancers, identifying tumours that went on to acquire amplifications at a later time point with an average AUC of 0.87. We show potential clinical utility by forecasting poor prognosis in low-grade gliomas via CDK4/PDGFRA amplification or CDKN2A deletion, and osimertinib resistance in lung cancers via MET amplification.

Here, we identified that BCBM patient serum contained extracellular vesicles (EVs) with high levels of microRNAs (miRNAs)-107 and -425. Levels of miR-107 and miR-425 were elevated in brain metastases, and the elevation was associated with poor patient prognoses. Ectopic expression of miR-107 and miR-425 promoted mammospheres; inhibition of miR-425, but not miR-107, suppressed breast cancer mammosphere formation. EVs from miR-425-overexpressing breast cancer cells strongly activated astrocytes whereas their inhibitors abrogated the effect. Conditioned media from miR-425-activated astrocytes promoted mammospheres. Within astrocytes, miR-425 suppressed expression of transcription factor ZNF24, which downregulated CCL8 cytokine expression/secretion, leading to subsequent activation of astrocytes. We further determined the role of miR-425 in brain metastasis formation and observed that miR-425-overexpressing breast cancer cells exhibited significantly more aggressive growth in mouse brains compared to control cells. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis of mouse brain metastases revealed that miR-425 tumors exhibited significantly increased activation, intratumoral accumulation, and proliferation of astrocytes, and a decrease in ZNF24 expression compared to control tumors.

As part of a recent study, we analyzed 802 treatment-naive, microsatellite-stable colorectal cancers (CRC) and identified a de novo signature, SBS_D, which was conservatively decomposed into SBS18, a signature associated with reactive oxygen species. Here, we re-evaluate this decomposition and provide evidence that SBS_D represents a distinct mutational process from that of SBS18. Through an independent analysis of 2,616 whole-genome sequenced microsatellite-stable CRCs across three distinct cohorts, we demonstrate that SBS_D is consistently present at a similar prevalence, suggesting that this signature may have been previously overlooked. Using a naive decomposition approach, we demonstrate that the pattern of SBS_D better aligns with signatures previously associated with deficiencies in DNA polymerase delta (POLD1) proofreading and mismatch repair. However, multiple lines of evidence, including the absence of pathogenic mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLD1 or in mismatch repair-associated genes, indicate that SBS_D is not driven by canonical defects in these DNA repair pathways. Overall, this study identifies a previously unrecognized mutational signature in microsatellite-stable CRC and proposes that its etiology may be linked to DNA repair infidelity emerging late in tumor development in samples without canonical defects in DNA repair pathways.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

We introduce an automated analysis pipeline (TURBO) for preprocessing and kinetic modeling of total-body [15O]H2O and [18F]FDG PET data, enabling efficient and reproducible analysis of tissue perfusion and metabolism at regional and voxel level. The approach employs automated CT segmentation for ROI delineation, image-derived input determination, and region-specific PET data kinetic modelling. Methods: We validated the analysis pipeline using Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers) total-body PET/CT scans from 21 subjects scanned with [15O]H2O and 16 subjects scanned with [18F]FDG using six ROIs (cortical brain gray matter, left iliopsoas, right kidney, pancreas, spleen and liver) representing different levels of blood flow and glucose metabolism. Results: Model fits showed good quality with consistent parameter estimates at both regional and voxel levels (R^2 > 0.91 for [15O]H2O, R^2 > 0.99 for [18F]FDG). Estimates from manual and automated input functions were correlated (R^2 > 0.86 for [15O]H2O, and R^2 > 0.88 for [18F]FDG) with minimal bias (<10% for [15O]H2O and <2% for [18F]FDG). Manually and automatically (CT-based) extracted ROI level data showed strong agreement (R^2 > 0.82 for [15O]H2O and R^2 > 0.83 for [18F]FDG), while motion correction had little impact on parameter estimates (R^2 > 0.83 for [15O]H2O and R^2 > 0.88 for [18F]FDG) compared with uncorrected data. Conclusion: Our automated analysis pipeline provides reliable and reproducible parameter estimates across different regions, with average processing time of <180 min per subject.

To understand if small- and large-scale muscle injuries activate distinct regenerative programs, we developed a systemic muscle injury model in zebrafish. Transcriptomic analysis of muscle and non-muscle tissues revealed that systemic and local muscle injuries elicit distinct molecular responses, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Systemic muscle injury activated the expression of Heparin bind-ing epidermal-like growth factor (Hb-EGF) in the epidermis, and Hb-EGF is necessary for sys-temic muscle repair.

A.", "abstract": "Heritable non-genetic phenotypic variation - broadly, epigenetics - can potentially influence evolutionary outcomes as direct targets of selection or through interactions with genetic variation. While their evolutionary benefits in generating phenotypic diversity in changing environments is well-characterized, there has been relatively little consideration of how the joint influence of epigenetic changes and mutations would affect traversal of multi-peak adaptive landscapes. Here, we discover general principles for how epigenetics, by generating an epigenetic quasispecies (clusters of semi-stable phenotypes mapped to a single genotype), tends to improve adaptive outcomes of an asexual population on rugged fitness landscapes even without environmental change. In particular, rapid epigenetic changes can sometimes smooth out suboptimal fitness peaks through incorporating fitness contributions of epimutations, allowing access to better adaptive outcomes. Remarkably, the average impact of epigenetics is more strongly influenced by an approximate balance between switching rates rather than the absolute rate at which those switches occur. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic changes can be influential even without having strong heritability and have a striking, yet generally invisible, beneficial role in shaping a populations adaptive trajectory.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Here I propose a hypothesis that will likely contribute to a full understanding of commonly observed differences in patterns of variation in mitochondrial DNA versus phenotypic traits and nuclear autosomal DNA. The Driving W Hypothesis applies to the many taxonomic groups (e.g., birds, butterflies and moths; most snakes; some amphibians, fish, and plants) in which females are heterogametic (i.e., have ZW sex chromosomes). If a W chromosome undergoes a mutation that gives it a transmission advantage in getting into the one egg produced by female meiosis, the driving W chromosome can spread rapidly through a population, carrying along the particular mitochondrial genome that happens to be associated with the driving W. Simulations show that W drivers spread much more rapidly than equivalent-strength Z or autosomal drivers, and that autosomal suppressors of W drive spread at a vastly lower rate. I summarize the logic and evidence in support of the seven components of this hypothesis and conclude that the driving W hypothesis has tremendous potential to explain observations of low within-population mitochondrial diversity as well as cases of \"mitochondrial capture\" between species.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Notably, age and diet exerted compounding effects, with older and HFD-fed mice displaying reduced odor-guided exploration (diet x age: F(1,1669)=16.04, p<0.001, eta squared effect size = 0.01). Memory analyses revealed robust genotype- and age-dependent impairments: at 24- and 48-hour delays, recognition indices were significantly lower in APOE4 mice compared to APOE2 (long-term memory: APOE x HN, F(2,395)=5.6, p=0.004). Elastic Net-regularized multi-set canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) linked behavior to brain network substrates, revealing subnetworks whose connectivity explained up to 24 percent of behavioral variance (sum of canonical correlations: 1.27, 95% CI [1.18, 1.85], p<0.0001). High-weighted connections between the ventral orbital cortex, somatosensory cortex, and cerebellar-brainstem pathways were identified as critical nodes for risk or compensation. Integrative blood transcriptomics revealed eigengene modules strongly correlated with imaging changes in olfactory-memory circuits (for example, eigengene 2 vs. subiculum diffusivity: r = -0.5, p < 1e-30, explaining up to 24 percent of variance). Gene ontology analysis pinpointed shared pathways in synaptic signaling, translation, and metabolic regulation across brain and blood. Notably, glutamatergic and synaptic pathways were enriched among genes linking peripheral and central compartments. Collectively, these results demonstrate that olfactory behavior, quantitatively shaped by genotype, age, diet, and immune status, serves as a sensitive and translatable early biomarker of Alzheimers disease risk. Our systems-level approach identifies specific brain networks and peripheral molecular signatures underlying sensory-cognitive vulnerability, providing a robust framework for early detection and targeted intervention in AD.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

LRRK2 mutations increase the phosphorylation of Rab substrates including Rab12. Rab12 is expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal cells with localization to membranes in the endolysosomal compartment. Under lysosomal stress, LRRK2 interaction with Rab12 upregulates LRRK2 kinase activity. In this study, using a recently developed monoclonal antibody directed to the LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation site on Rab12 at amino acid Ser106 (pS106-Rab12), we test whether aberrant LRRK2 phosphorylation is associated with tau and/or -synuclein pathology across clinically distinct neurodegenerative diseases. Analysis of brain tissue lysates and immunohistochemistry of pathology-susceptible brain regions demonstrate that pS106-Rab12 levels are increased in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and PD, and in LRRK2 mutation carriers. In early pathological stages, phosphorylated Rab12 localizes to granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVBs), which are thought to be active lysosomal-like structures, in neurons. pS106-Rab12-positive GVBs accumulate with pathological tau stage across brain tissues in DLB, AD, and PD, and in LRRK2 mutation carriers. In a mouse model of tauopathy, pS106-Rab12 localizes to GVBs during early tau deposition in an age-dependent manner. While GVBs are largely absent in neurons with mature protein pathology, subsets of both tau and -synuclein inclusions appear to incorporate pS106-Rab12 at later pathological stages. Finally, pS106-Rab12 labels GVBs in neurons and shows widespread co-pathology with tau inclusions in primary tauopathies including Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. These results implicate LRRK2 kinase activity and Rab phosphorylation in endolysosomal dysfunction in both tau and -synuclein-associated neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The observation that diabetic patients always under tight-glycemic control consistently show better cardiovascular disease outcomes compared to patients who transition to tight-glycemic control after prior conventional glycemic control lead to the concept of metabolic memory. Mechanisms such as epigenetics possibly mediate the lasting metabolic memory effects, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited. Increased cardiac protein posttranslational O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification is implicated in cardiac remodeling observed in diabetes, and our previous work shows chronically elevated cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAc causes adverse cardiac changes. Therefore, the current study hypothesized that transiently increased cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAcylation leads to exacerbated adverse cardiac remodeling after subsequent pressure-overload. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using our previously described inducible cardiomyocyte specific, dominant-negative O-GlcNAcase (dnOGAh) mouse and single transgenic littermate controls (Con), we induced O-GlcNAc levels for 2wk (ON), followed by a 2wk washout (OFF); mice then underwent transverse-aortic constriction (TAC) or Sham surgery. We observed the expected cardiac remodeling in TAC groups, including decreased cardiac function, and increased hypertrophy and fibrosis. Moreover, these pathologic measures were exacerbated in the ON/OFF-TAC vs. Con-TAC mice; additionally, transcriptomic analysis of LV-tissue from each experimental group showed pathways which not only supported our fibrosis, hypertrophy and functional results of exacerbated cardiac remodeling, but also, revealed potential novel molecular pathways underlying this pathologic remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: We observed exacerbated cardiac pathology between ON/OFF-TAC vs. Con-TAC groups supporting the concept of 'O-GlcNAc memory' as a component of metabolic memory. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis provides insight into potential molecular pathways underpinning this metabolic/O-GlcNAc memory such as Ccn2/CTGF-driven fibrosis, and/or Nox4-driven oxidative stress.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

K.; Bhusal, K.", "abstract": "Background: Stature, a factor that helps in personal identification, can be estimated using measurements of various body parts. This study measured the length and breadth of hands and the height of the participants, aiming to estimate the stature from the dimensions of the hands. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 195 medical students aged 18 to 24 were enrolled, and it was carried out from 3rd November 2023 to 14th April 2024. Measurement of stature was taken by stadiometer, and hand length and breadth were taken by Vernier calliper. Results: Mean stature was higher in males (170.24{+/-}5.79 cm) as compared to females (159.01{+/-}7.261 cm). Mean length and breadth of both right and left hands were also found to be higher in males (Right hand length = 18.48{+/-}1.00 cm, Left hand length = 18.57{+/-}1.01 cm, Right hand breadth = 8.36{+/-}4.78 cm, and Left hand breadth = 8.26{+/-}5.03 cm) as compared with females (Right hand length = 16.861{+/-}0.96 cm, Left hand length = 16.897{+/-}0.95 cm, Right hand breadth = 7.31{+/-}0.58 cm, and Left hand breadth = 7.23{+/-}0.58 cm). The model summary of the multiple linear regression analysis deduced that R is .805, which indicates that there is a strong positive correlation between stature and hand dimensions with an Standard Error of Estimates of 5.083 cm and R2 of 0.648. Conclusion: This study was done on medical students, and it generated regression equations for estimation of stature by taking into account hand length and hand breadth. There was a positive correlation between hand dimensions and stature estimation. Similar studies can be done in the future, taking a larger population size and participants from various age groups to see if there is an influence of age factor in stature estimation.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Y.; Tian, Q.", "abstract": "Short-range association fibers (SAFs) are critical for cortical communications but are often underestimated in conventional resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) since they locate within a ~1.5mm thin layer of superficial white matter. With the emergence of sub-millimeter diffusion imaging techniques, this study timely evaluated the effects of image spatial resolution on SAF reconstruction using simulation data and multi-resolution (2, 1.5, and 0.96 mm iso.) empirical data acquired on the same 20 healthy subjects using the gSlider sequence and 20 widely used tractography approaches. Resolution effects were qualitatively assessed through model fitting and tractography results and quantitatively evaluated using global and regional short-range connectivity strength (SCS). It is found that lower resolution systematically reduced SCS across all methods in a spatially varying way. Moreover, tractography methods exhibited significant differences in resolution sensitivity, with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based single-tissue single-fiber tractography showing greater vulnerability than constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based multi-tissue multi-fiber tractography, and probabilistic tracking with anatomical constraints (ACT) and filtering (SIFT) improved robustness. Finally, up-sampling data to nominally higher resolution partially mitigated resolution-induced degradation and improved SAF reconstruction accuracy, particularly for DTI tractography. Based on these findings, higher resolution and multi-shell imaging is recommended if possible. For a given dataset, data up-sampling and DTI-based probabilistic tracking with ACT is recommended for single-shell low b-value data. CSD-based probabilistic tracking with ACT and SIFT is recommended for single-shell higher b-value data and multi-shell data. In summary, this study systematically and quantitatively evaluated resolution effects on SAF reconstruction and structural connectivity estimation and provides practical guidelines for more accurate mapping of SAFs that will improve the characterization of healthy and diseased human brains in a wide range of neuroscientific and clinical applications.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Recent research has focused on incorporating viscous and elastic properties into hydrogels to investigate cellular responses to time-dependent mechanical properties of the ECM. However, a critical aspect often overlooked is that cells continuously remodel their microenvironment in hydrogels, such as by the deposition of newly secreted (nascent) ECM. While this nascent ECM has been demonstrated to play a vital role in transmitting mechanical signals across various biological contexts, the mechanisms by which it regulates cellular function in response to time-dependent mechanical properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed an interpenetrating polymer network that enables independent control of viscous and elastic hydrogel properties. We show that cells cultured on high-viscosity hydrogels deposit increased nascent ECM which also correlates with enhanced hydrogel remodeling. Interestingly, higher nascent ECM deposition on high-viscosity hydrogels was decoupled from intracellular contractility. These results establish a relationship between hydrogel viscosity and nascent ECM deposition that may extend to diverse cell types and offer new insights into cell-hydrogel interactions.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Among these, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and extracellular targeted protein degradation (eTPD) specifically depend on efficient lysosomal trafficking for activity. However, many tumor antigens exhibit poor internalization, limiting ADC effectiveness. To address this, we developed low-density lipoprotein receptor-targeting chimeras (LIPTACs), leveraging the constitutive endocytic and recycling activity of the LDLR to enhance lysosomal delivery. LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LDLR-mediated trafficking can enhance eTPD and ADCs, providing a hybrid blueprint for developing next-generation antibody therapeutics with broader utility and improved efficacy in cancer treatment.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Drug-resistance demands exploring new targets against this illness. Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) is a crucial target in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that participates in initiation and elongation of translation and represents a protein of evolutionary interest. To elucidate the structure-function relationships of MetRS, we performed detailed sequence analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of Mtb MetRS in the substrate-bound (methionine and ATP) and intermediate (methionyl-AMP) states, for both the wild-type and three single-mutant forms (H21A, K54A, and E130A). Eight systems (two wild-type and six mutants) were simulated for 24 microseconds. Differential dynamics and binding effects of the substrate versus intermediate states were identified, along with the molecular reasons for the loss of activity in mutants. The wild-type substrate state was more stable than the intermediate state. In contrast, the mutants were more unstable in the substrate state, but incorporated stability into the intermediate state protein. These findings suggest that methionyl-AMP, being a reaction intermediate, exhibits a short residence time at the MetRS active site, while the substrate state shows a longer residence time of methionine and ATP. The increased instability of mutants in the substrate state indicates disruption of the pyrophosphate-ATP exchange by altering substrate-protein interactions. Once the intermediate is formed, the mutations have minimal or no effect. These observations are consistent with experimental data. In brief, our study finds the molecular basis for the distinct substrate and intermediate recognition by Mtb MetRS and establishes a mechanism for loss of activity in the mutants.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Using rabbit lungs and in primary rabbit and human macrophages as well as human THP-1 cell line-derived macrophages for infection with laboratory (H37Rv) or clinical Mtb strains (HN878 or CDC1551) that differ in virulence, we show that NLRP3 inflammasome activation by HIF-1a and GBP1 leads to elevated mitochondrial stress, apoptosis and necrosis during progressive infection by HN878.

CRISPR-based genome editing offers a promising approach to enhance the potency and safety of CAR-T cells. However, several challenges persist, including inefficient tumor homing and treatment-related toxicities in normal tissues, which continue to hinder widespread adoption. Advanced imaging technologies, including bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and positron emission tomography (PET), provide real-time insights into CAR-T cell distribution and activity in vivo, both in preclinical models and in patients. Here, we developed Trackable Reporter Adaptable CRISPR-Edited CAR (tRACE-CAR) T cells, a modular system for site-specific integration of CARs and imaging reporters. Methods: The luciferase reporter AkaLuciferase (AkaLuc) or the human sodium iodide symporter (NIS) were cloned downstream of the CAR in adeno-associated virus (AAV) donors for BLI or PET tracking, respectively. CARs with imaging reporters were knocked into the TRAC locus of primary human T cells via CRISPR editing and AAV transduction. Editing efficiency was evaluated by flow cytometry and junction PCR. In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed by BLI using firefly luciferase (Fluc)-expressing cancer cells co-cultured with CAR-T cells at varying effector-to-target ratios. In vivo, BLI and PET imaging assessed CAR-AkaLuc and CAR-NIS T cell expansion and trafficking in Nod-SCID-gamma mice bearing xenograft tumors. Results: T cell receptor (TCR) knockout efficiency exceeded 85%, with CAR expression observed in 70-80% of cells, depending on the reporter used. Reporter-engineered CAR-T cells retained functionality in vitro and exhibited significant cytotoxicity against target cancer cells, outperforming naive T cells. In vivo, AkaLuc BLI and 18F-tetrafluoroborate PET enabled non-invasive tracking of viable CAR-T cells. Notably, the route of administration (intravenous, peritumoral, or intraperitoneal) significantly influenced the distribution of CAR-T cells and their therapeutic effectiveness. Conclusion: tRACE-CAR enabled precise optical and PET tracking of CAR-T cells in models of B cell leukemia and ovarian cancer, allowing dynamic, non-invasive monitoring of cell distribution in both tumors and off-target tissues.

It has been shown to enhance the expression of muscle differentiation - related factors in mice, but whether it can promote myogenic differentiation of stem cells for treating skeletal muscle atrophy remains unclear. Adipose - derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) have great potential in muscle atrophy treatment due to their abundant source and excellent differentiation capacity. This study aimed to investigate if melittin could induce myogenic differentiation of ADSCs and improve skeletal muscle atrophy when combined with ADSCs. Methods: ADSCs were treated with melittin at 4 concentration ranges (0.02 - 320 mg/L) for 48 h, and cell viability was detected by CCK - 8. Western blot was used to measure the expression of myogenic factors (MYOG, MYF5, etc.) and p38 - MAPK pathway proteins. A mouse model of rotator cuff injury was established, with groups including control, injury, stem cell therapy (SC), and melittin combined with SC (SC + M). Muscle repair was evaluated by H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, etc. Results: Suitable melittin concentrations showed no toxicity to ADSCs but significantly upregulated myogenic factors. The SC + M group exhibited higher expression of MYOD and MYOG, and significantly improved muscle weight, fiber diameter, and cross - sectional area compared with the SC group. Mechanistically, melittin promoted myogenic differentiation by activating the p38 - MAPK signaling pathway. Conclusion: Melittin promotes myogenic differentiation of ADSCs via the p38 - MAPK pathway.

However, the mechanism by which LAMV is attenuated is not well understood, contributing to the increased vaccine hesitancy that has caused a worldwide resurgence of measles. Here, we provide a molecular model of attenuation that implicates increased host innate immune responses and increased LAMV susceptibility to those responses. Our study leverages both in vitro and in vivo models of infection to find that acute induction of innate immunity in immune cells is the critical determinant of LAMV attenuation. We show that LAMV, in contrast to pathogenic wild type measles virus (MeV), causes a strong IFN response in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which restricts viral replication and spread in a post-entry manner. LAMV can enter, transcribe viral mRNA and translate viral proteins in immune cells, but is not able to form infectious particles and spread from cell to cell. Specifically, we find that mutations conserved across LAMV strains in the P/V/C and H genes are responsible for the induction of IFN and the restriction of infectious virus production. In PBMC cultures and in rhesus macaques, LAMV infection also results in the acute induction of proinflammatory cytokines that likely play a role in the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Overall, our study provides a virological and immunological framework for LAMV attenuation which can be leveraged in repurposing the LAMV backbone and in future vaccine design.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

We profiled the cultures over time by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and sequenced the genomes of 34 isolates from the enrichments to gain functional insights. Notably, taxa whose relative abundance increased during community growth on methane represented more than a dozen families, many of which are not known to utilize methane or other one-carbon substrates. Despite the selective pressure imposed by the culture condition, the final community structures were taxonomically varied rather than converging to a common composition, and genomic analysis of the sequenced isolates revealed considerable variation in likely carbon source utilization repertoires.

While m6A methylation of host mRNAs has been studied in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, its role in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is unknown. Here, we analyzed direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) data from infected human lung cells (Calu-3) using a machine learning m6A detection framework. We observed a global increase in m6A levels across ten antiviral response-associated lncRNAs, with UCA1, GAS5, and NORAD--regulators of interferon (IFN) signaling--showing the most pronounced changes. This might, in part, explain the attenuated IFN expression observed in infected cells. We identified methylated DRACH motifs in predicted lncRNA duplex-forming regions, which may favor Hoogsteen base-pairing, which destabilize secondary structures and target interaction sites. These results provide new perspectives on how SARS-CoV-2 could impact lncRNAs to modulate host immunity and viral persistence through m6A-dependent mechanisms.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

In this study, we produced soluble recombinant catalytic domain of human Gb3/CD77 synthase in two expression hosts known for different glycosylation pattern: Trichoplusia ni insect cells (High Five) and human embryonic kidney cells (EXPI293F). The High Five cells generate short oligomannose structures, while the EXPI293F cells synthesize complex type glycans. We evaluated the activity of High Five-derived and EXPI293F-derived enzymes, characterized the structures of their N-glycans and showed that High Five cells provide a higher amount and activity of the enzyme. Moreover, we used the EXPI293F cells to evaluate the N- and C-terminal location of the 6xHis-tag and found that only the N-terminally tagged EXPI293F-derived enzyme demonstrated activity. In contrast, the enzyme produced in High Five cells was active despite carrying a C-terminal tag.

We identified 16 differentially expressed genes and 30 nearby differentially methylated CpG sites. Six key genes SRXN1, FURIN, IL18RAP, FOXO3, GCNT4, and FKBP5 were either up-regulated or down-regulated near hypomethylated CpG sites. These genes are associated with viral infiltration, immune activation, lung damage, and oxidative stress-related multi-organ failure, which are the hallmarks of severe COVID-19.

In this study, we investigated the interactions between Class I neutralizing antibodies BD55-1205, BD-604, OMI-42, P5S-1H1, and P5S-2B10 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using multiscale modeling which combined coarse-grained simulations and atomistic reconstruction of conformational landscapes together with mutational scanning of the binding interfaces, dynamic profiling of binding and immune escape using molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) analysis. A central theme emerging from this work is the critical role of epitope breadth and interaction diversity in determining an antibody resilience to mutations. BD55-1205 antibody exemplifies the advantages of broad epitope coverage and distributed hotspot mechanisms. By engaging an extensive network of residues across the RBD, BD55-1205 minimizes its dependence on individual side-chain conformations, allowing it to maintain robust binding even when key residues are mutated. This adaptability is particularly evident in its tolerance to mutations at positions such as L455 and F456 , which severely compromise other antibodies. The ability of BD55-1205 to sustain cumulative interactions underscores the importance of targeting diverse epitopes through multiple interaction mechanisms, a strategy that enhances resistance to immune evasion while maintaining functional integrity. In contrast, BD-604 and OMI-42, with localized binding mechanisms, are more vulnerable to escape mutations at critical positions such as L455, F456, and A475. P5S-1H1 and P5S-2B10 exhibit intermediate behavior, balancing specificity and adaptability but lacking the robustness of BD55-1205. Mutational scanning identified key residues Y421, Y489, and F456 as critical hotspots for RBD stability and antibody binding, highlighting their dual role in viral fitness and immune evasion. The computational predictions generated through mutational scanning and MM-GBSA analysis demonstrate excellent agreement with experimental data on average antibody escape scores.

Pathogenesis is often modelled using the P. aeruginosa PAO1 reference strain but laboratory lineages vary in the sequence and activity of MexT, a global regulator impacting virulence, biofilm formation and ciprofloxacin resistance. We defined the impact of active versus inactive MexT in PAO1 and observed global transcriptomic changes affecting the expression of 900 genes. Phenotyping revealed altered metabolism, antibiotic resistance and virulence - resulting in striking variation across a single model organism. We propose that antibiotic-resistance, introduced during work with the original PAO1 strain, has caused plasticity in mexT that accounts for variation across lineages. To test this, we introduced antibiotic resistance into clinical P. aeruginosa isolates and observed downstream mutations in mexT when selective pressure was removed, supporting the proposed evolutionary pathway. Overall, we have demonstrated the transcriptomic basis of MexT as a phenotypic switch in PAO1 and implicated antibiotic resistance as a cause of downstream changes in mexT in P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, MexS/MexT-regulated efflux is implicated in the antibiotic stress response and virulence, helping identify the mechanisms for rapid phenotypic switching through mexT and confirming that PAO1 is a very different organism compared to most isolates. Improved understanding of the regulatory changes linked to antibiotic resistance is particularly relevant to P. aeruginosa where cycles of antibiotic treatment are common.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Clinical studies reveal significant M1 antibody responses post-infection and vaccination, with demonstrated B and T cell recognition. Our study examines 2B-B10-G9, our lab-synthesized mAb targeting conserved linear epitope of M1 at the C-terminal domain (CTD). Methods: Binding of 2B-B10-G9 to the purified influenza A viruses (IAV) and influenza B viruses (IBV) were assessed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with Image J analysis. Purified viruses included IAV (H1N1, Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm09), and H3N2 subtypes) and IBV which was first isolated in 1940 (B/Lee/40), and B/Victoria lineage. Cytotoxicity of 2B-B10-G9 on the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was studied by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell proliferation assay to establish in vitro and in ovo treatment doses. In ovo studies involved injecting 2B-B10-G9 into the allantoic cavity of specific pathogen free (SPF) 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) immediately post-infection with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) followed by RT-qPCR analysis of the virulence genes HA, NA, and PB1 expressions in the allantoic fluid (AF) 48 hours post-infection. Results: mAb 2B-B10-G9 shows significantly stronger binding to the M1 protein of H1N1 subtype of IAV with respect to H3N2 subtype of IAV (p < 0.001), and it has significantly stronger binding to the M1 protein of H1N1 subtype of IAV with respect to H1N1pdm09 subtype, IBV including B/Lee/40, B/Victoria lineage. (p< 0.0001) mAb 2B-B10-G9 at dose of 40 ug/ml which was determined as an optimal dose according to the MTT assay, significantly reduced plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml of IAV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in vitro (p< 0.0001). In ovo treatment of IAV H1N1 subtype at the same dose 40 ug/ml, significantly suppressed the virulence genes HA, NA, and PB1 expressions compared to the untreated group (p< 0.0001, p< 0.001, p< 0.0001, respectively) and mouse isotype IgG1 mAb treated groups (p< 0.01). Conclusions: These findings highlight that anti-M1 mAb 2B-B10-G9, targeting conserved linear epitope at the CTD of M1 protein, might be considered as a possible therapeutic option for IAV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes related to its significant recognition and binding, viral neutralization and suppression of expression of virulence genes including HA, NA and PB1.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Pregnant macaques, either flavivirus-naive or with prior dengue virus (DENV) exposure, were inoculated in the first trimester (~30 or 45 gestational days) with an Asian or African lineage of ZIKV or received a saline injection as controls. Maternal plasma viremia duration, viral RNA burden at the maternal-fetal interface, and neutralizing antibody titers did not differ between inoculation cohorts or controls. At 12 months, ZIKV-exposed infants demonstrated altered maternal attachment behaviors and reduced inhibition when approaching sensory stimuli compared to controls. Visual pathway function, assessed by electrophysiology, was significantly impaired at 3 months but normalized by 12 months. Hearing loss was more common among ZIKV-exposed infants, although not statistically significant. Developmental outcomes were associated with prenatal ZIKV exposure itself, independent of viremia duration, neutralizing antibody titer, viral lineage, or maternal DENV immunity, and were not mediated by visual impairment or hearing loss.

We utilized cell lines from the focal host, D. innubila, as well as available cell lines from D. virilis and D. melanogaster and inoculated with both a wild-collected pool of naive virus and a D. innubila cell culture-adapted isolate. We found that virus from wild caught flies infected cells from the 3 cell lines and replicate its genome, but the passage 1 fluids from these infections were unable to reinfect upon introduction to new cells. In contrast, a cell culture-adapted strain of DiNV infected the same Drosophila cells (though relatively poorly in D. melanogaster cells) and produced infectious progeny that infected new cells.

Since its classification as ciliopathy in 2003, NPH disease causal attribution had been focused primarily on ciliary dysfunction. The finding that ciliopathy players are involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling resulted in a paradigm shift in thinking on NPH disease aetiology. Mutations in NPHP1 are the leading cause of NPH, but the underlying mechanisms that lead to the disease phenotype remain poorly understood. Here, nephrocystin-1 depleted kidney organoids were generated and characterized to address this knowledge gap. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate NPHP1 control (NPHP1WT) and two mutant (NPHP1ko1 and NPHP1ko2.) cell lines from healthy human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), differentiated into kidney organoids in an air-liquid interface following an optimized protocol. Upon loss of nephrocystin-1, kidney organoids showed impaired nephron structures and loss of glomerular mesangial and distal tubular cells. Furthermore, NPHP1 depleted organoids exhibited a persistent inability to repair DNA lesions and showed increased senescence and fibrosis characteristics. Dynamic subcellular localization of nephrocystin-1 in NPHP1WT, particularly its translocation to nuclei 15 min post-UVC light exposure, suggested its direct involvement in the DDR. In conclusion, a novel NPHP1-depleted kidney organoid model was established, providing a platform to comprehensively study DNA damage, senescence and fibrosis simultaneously upon nephrocystin-1 loss.

The dominant yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum varied dramatically in abundance (4.3-97.5%) and exhibited significant local adaptation and maladaptation patterns across orchard-variety combinations. Critically, H. uvarum local adaptation strongly predicted community composition: locally adapted populations achieved higher abundance while suppressing competitors. However, local adaptation had no effect on community-level performance in apple decomposition. Communities dominated by locally adapted H. uvarum performed equivalently to diverse assemblages, indicating functional redundancy among species.

Here, we report two families with SLC5A6 mutations presenting with early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). To investigate the link between vitamin deficiency and DCM, we generated a novel cardiac-specific Slc5a6 knockout (Slc5a6cKO) mouse model and tested the therapeutic potential of vitamin supplementation. Methods Cardiac function in Slc5a6cKO mice was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and ECG measurements. Histological, biochemical, and proteomic analyses were conducted to identify structural and metabolic changes. The impact of dietary biotin and pantothenic acid supplementation on disease progression was evaluated. Results Slc5a6cKO mice developed progressive cardiac dysfunction, manifesting as DCM with cardiac dilation, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, impaired Coenzyme A synthesis, and metabolic imbalance, culminating in premature death by 26 weeks. Proteomic analysis revealed early mitochondrial metabolic disruption and extracellular matrix protein upregulation at 8 weeks, preceding overt cardiac dysfunction. Strikingly, vitamin supplementation from preconception onwards, prevented the cardiac phenotype, preserving cardiac structure, function, morphology and survival. This parallels the clinical outcome in one patient who received early vitamin treatment, compared to another who required a heart transplant following delayed vitamin treatment.

However, the OM TAC module which is composed of five subunits, has previously been suspected to follow more complicated assembly pathways. Here, we identified four detergent-soluble OM TAC module subcomplexes that we assign to two classes. One class contains an oligomeric TAC40 complex that according to AlphaFold contains 6-8 subunits, as well as two subcomplexes of different sizes comprising TAC40, TAC42, and TAC60. The second class consists of a single complex composed of TAC65 and pATOM36. We show that the two subcomplex classes form independently and accumulate upon impairment of TAC assembly. The expression of an N-terminally truncated TAC60 variant causes the accumulation of the larger TAC40/TAC42/TAC60 complex and blocks completion of OM TAC module assembly. This suggests the following assembly pathway: i) TAC40 oligomerizes, ii) TAC42 and TAC60 bind the TAC40 oligomer forming two discrete larger intermediates, where iii) the larger subcomplex merges with the pATOM36/TAC65 subcomplex subsequently forming the OM TAC module.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

The gene exhibited statistically significant overexpression in CML (p < 0.0001), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 1.0, indicating perfect classification capability. Notably, RXFP1 retained its expression profile even after imatinib treatment, suggesting its independence from BCR-ABL signaling and making it a promising candidate for disease monitoring regardless of therapeutic status. To facilitate nonprogrammatic analysis and reproducibility, a GUI tool was developed using Python, which integrates statistical tests, visual plots (ROC, box plots, Mann-Whitney curve), and a text-to-speech reporting system. Manual validation further confirmed RXFP1's discriminatory power, with zero expression overlapping between CML and normal samples across all experimental subgroups. This research is also driven by a personal motivation: the author's wife is a CML patient undergoing TKI treatment and experiencing side effects. This study emerged from the author's desire to find a safer and more precise diagnostic pathway. These findings suggest that RXFP1 is a robust and treatment-independent molecular biomarker for CML, laying a foundation for larger studies and therapeutic exploration. This study also demonstrates the potential of integrated AI tools in accelerating biomarker discovery and empowering independent researchers to contribute to precision medicine.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "We present a Monte Carlo framework for simulating the nucleation of biomolecular condensates in the grand canonical ensemble, which overcomes the limitations of fixed particle number and allows direct control of the dilute-phase concentration. Our approach combines conformation sampling with bias-enhanced cluster size sampling, enabling accurate sampling of individual cluster sizes in various conformations. Our method resolves nucleation free energy surfaces and is capable of capturing both classical and nonclassical nucleation mechanisms. We validated our method by reproducing structural properties of disordered proteins across a diverse benchmark set and by applying it to study nucleation in two phase-separating proteins, FUS-LC and NDDX4, using both HPS and MPIPI coarse-grained force fields. While both proteins exhibit classical nucleation behavior under the HPS model, only FUS-LC remains classical with MPIPI. In contrast, NDDX4 shows a distinctly nonclassical nucleation pathway under MPIPI, characterized by a metastable intermediate state near the cluster size of 53 protein chains. Morphological analysis reveals that clusters up to this point are compact and spherical, whereas larger clusters adopt a nonspherical, two-lobed geometry indicative of frustrated coalescence. These findings underscore the critical role of sequence composition and force field parameterization in shaping nucleation pathways and demonstrate the utility of our framework for uncovering complex, mechanism-rich free energy landscapes in biomolecular condensation.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Some of these cytokines are involved in the neuroimmune axis, so we aimed to ascertain if {gamma}{delta}T cells and neurons exhibit crosstalk during wound repair. We identified a prevalent NPY1R+ peripheral neuron subset in the skin. {gamma}{delta}T cells interact with NPY1R+ neurons in the epidermis and dermis of both nonwounded and wounded murine skin. To determine the impact of the {gamma}{delta}TCR on NPY1R+ neuron interactions in wound healing, we compared epidermal T cell-neuron interactions in TCR{delta} -/- mice during wound repair. We found a decrease in interactions between epidermal {gamma}{delta}T cells and NPY1R+ neurons in TCR{delta}-/- mice, suggesting {gamma}{delta}T cells communicate with NPY1R+ neurons more frequently than {gamma}{delta} T cells in the epidermis, regardless of wound repair. In contrast, dermal T cell-neuron interactions in wildtype and TCR{delta} -/- mice during wound repair were similar between {gamma}{delta}T cells and {beta}T cells, suggesting both T cell types mediate communications with neurons in the dermis. In obese mice there are fewer NPY1R+ neurons and diminished neuron-T cell interactions indicative of neuropathy.

ZBP1 recognises Z-RNA or Z-DNA, left-handed double-stranded RNA or DNA structures that accumulate after virus infection. How the interaction between Z-RNA/DNA and ZBP1 governs its activation and how this mediates downstream signalling remains unclear. Using herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) as an activator of human ZBP1 we find that binding of the N-terminal Z domains of ZBP1 to Z-RNA induces ZBP1 condensate formation. This then mediates oligomerisation of the RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs) of ZBP1 establishing an amyloidal signalling complex with RIPK1 and RIPK3 that induces necroptotic cell death. We find that the kinase activity of RIPK1 is essential for RIPK1 and RIPK3 oligomerisation downstream of human ZBP1. Finally, the HSV-1-encoded RHIM-containing protein ICP6, does not interfere with Z domain-mediated ZBP1 condensate formation, but instead prevents downstream RIPK1 and RIPK3 oligomerisation thereby inhibiting necroptosis and promoting viral growth. Together, this shows that ZBP1 condensate formation restricts HSV-1 infection by promoting host cell necroptosis.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Recent predictions show an increment in MHW frequency, duration and intensity worldwide along with climate change. Nevertheless, little is known about MHW impacts on marine microbial life and, specifically, on algal blooms. Recent studies in yeast and green algae suggested that thermotolerance is mediated by metacaspases (MC), cysteine proteases, structurally similar to caspases known to mediate programmed cell death. Initially we created a heatwave model of 72-hours that exposes the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to elevated temperature with a recovery phase that enables to capture the mechanisms underpinning such acclimation. We generated triple knock-out mutants of the PtMCA genes and identified a vital role for MC in heat-stress acclimation. PtMCA triple mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to the heatwave treatment, which induced cell death that peaked days after returning to initial temperatures. We further revealed that heatwave treatment induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and the PtMCA mutants were hypersensitive to oxidative stress as compared to WT cells. We propose that metacaspases have a pivotal role in diatom acclimation to elevated temperatures a trait vital for algal survival considering climate change.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Yet, as tumors develop resistance, complementary strategies are emerging, including targeting microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Given that PARP1 is widely described as a key promoter of MMEJ, one would expect PARP inhibition to suppress MMEJ, potentially making MMEJ inhibition redundant. MMEJ was originally described as a backup pathway, with seminal work linking PARP1 to MMEJ conducted in NHEJ-deficient cells, where MMEJ can be reactivated in G1. However, we now appreciate that MMEJ is a mitotic repair mechanism, but the function of PARP1 in this context remains unclear. Here, we systematically explore the effect that PARP/PARPi have on MMEJ activity in cells with intact NHEJ. Surprisingly, PARP inhibition leads to elevated PolQ-dependent MMEJ levels at ISceI-mediated DSBs, which we find is due to PARP1 regulation of competing pathways at these breaks. Importantly, we show that PARP is dispensable for MMEJ at double-ended DSBs and is expendable for repair of DSBs during mitosis. Altogether, this data shifts the understanding of PARP role in MMEJ and DNA repair pathway choice. Moreover, we believe this data further strengthens a rationale for PARPi/MMEJi combinatorial drug treatment in HR-deficient cancers.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

J.; van den Heuvel, J.", "abstract": "Gene drive technology may be a valuable tool for addressing several contemporary challenges, including combating disease vectors, conserving biodiversity, and controlling agricultural pests. Homing gene drives spread through a population by copying themselves onto the homologous chromosome in the germline of heterozygous individuals. However, it is possible that resistance will evolve against homing gene drives, especially if the goal is to suppress or eliminate a pest population so that resistance alleles have a large selective advantage over the gene drive. Resistance can result from a simple mutation at the drive's target site, which is found in many studies but can potentially be avoided by improving drive design. However, a more complex polygenic type of resistance could also evolve through selection on standing genetic variation that affects the efficiency of the spread of the gene drive. In this study, we test an efficient homing gene drive in genetically diverse lines of Drosophila melanogaster, collected from across Europe by the DrosEU Consortium. We find that the gene drive shows considerable variability in homing efficiency, but that none of this variability can be ascribed to heritable genetic effects. Selection for complex resistance is thus unlikely and will be inefficient, probably still giving a gene drive enough time to fixate in the population. However, although our tested gene drive targets a highly conserved haploinsufficient gene with two gRNAs, we find simple resistance alleles in viable offspring. Half of these are the product of end-joining repair instead of homing and may still carry heavy fitness costs. However, the other half are the result of partial homing events. These alleles indicate that resistance could likely evolve against this gene drive in a simple, non-polygenic way. Therefore, more effective strategies may be required to address simple resistance mutations, whereas complex resistance may be unlikely to pose a substantial barrier to the employment of at least certain types of gene drive.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

In the 16th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP16), our predictors built on MULTICOM4 ranked among the top performers out of 120 predictors in tertiary structure prediction and outperformed a standard AlphaFold3 predictor. The average TM-score of our best performing predictor MULTCOM's top-1 prediction for 84 CASP16 domain is 0.902.

Using the T2T version of the human genome we have mapped the position of human tDNAs and analyzed their individual transcriptional activities. Then we have characterized, at single base resolution, the impact of somatic mutations in human tDNAs and its relationship to the transcriptional status of each gene. We confirm that tDNAs are hotspots for somatic mutagenesis, and show that they display mutational loads that are directly proportional to their transcription rates. Highly transcribed tDNAs in tumors or healthy tissues accumulate mutations at rates up to nine-fold higher than highly transcribed protein-coding genes. Mutational loads at tDNAs are tumor-specific, and increase with patient age. Mutations at structurally conserved tRNA positions appear to be under negative selection. Strikingly, anticodon nucleotides crucial for decoding frequently acquire somatic mutations, readily generating chimeric tRNAs species capable of systematically introducing amino acid substitutions across the proteome.

Identifying new genes involved in the interaction between V. vinifera and B. cinerea appears to be the most promising strategy for enhancing grapevine resistance to this pathogen in future breeding programs. During pathogen infection, plasma membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are involved in the perception of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Among PRRs, members of the LysM receptor-like kinase family are well known to mediate recognition of fungal MAMPs to induce the plant immune signaling pathway. Interestingly, a novel member of this receptor family, named VvLYK6, was identified in grapevine as the most upregulated during a Botrytis cinerea infection. Aiming to understand the role of VvLYK6 in plant immunity, we carried out an overexpression study in Arabidopsis thaliana and in grapevine cell suspension. The overexpression of VvLYK6 resulted in a reduction of chitin oligomer-induced MAPKs activation, expression of defense-related genes, a reduced callose deposition and an increased plant susceptibility to three fungal pathogens. At the opposite, the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated vvlyk6 knock-out lines generated in V. vinifera induce the phytoalexin-related stilbene pathway at the basal level.

We discovered that PhoP, a key determinant of mycobacterial adaptation to phagosomal acidification, controls expression of AnsP1 and AnsP2 to facilitate acquisition of host aspartate and asparagine, respectively. Thus, macrophage-infected WT-H37Rv showed a significantly higher level of intra-bacterial Asn compared to the phoP-KO mutant and a complemented mutant could restore Asn level to that of WT-H37Rv. Under acidic conditions, elevated DNA binding of PhoP within the promoters lead to direct activation of ansP1 and ansP2.

The existence of a cilia-dependent cyst activation (CDCA) pathway has been identified by demonstrating that structurally intact primary cilia are crucial for cyst growth following loss of polycystins. We previously used translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) RNA-Seq on pre-cystic mouse kidneys to determine the translatome that meet the criteria for CDCA and identified Glis2 as an early effector of polycystin signaling. Here, we investigate the potential role of Glis3 in ADPKD, which, while not transcriptionally altered, encodes a cilia-localized transcription factor belonging to the same family of genes as Glis2. Methods: We used live cell confocal imaging to study the subcellular localization of Glis3 in the presence or absence of Pkd1. We used Glis3 conditional knockout mice to investigate the genetic interaction between Glis3 and Pkd1. Changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility were assessed by RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq on an allelic series of Glis3 and Pkd1 kidney selective inactivation models at 7-weeks age to evaluate the function of Glis3. Results: The ciliary localization of Glis3 is not affected by Pkd1 mutation status. Kidney selective Glis3 by itself does not affect kidney structure or function, but dual inactivation of Glis3 and Pkd1 significantly worsen polycystic kidney disease. Integration of transcriptomic profiling and chromatin accessibility assays suggested that kidney tubule specific Glis3 inactivation results in dysregulated fatty acid metabolism and circadian. Conclusions: Glis3 is a primary cilium localized transcription factor that genetically interacts with Pkd1 and modifies kidney epithelial cell metabolism and circadian function.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

Acute stress suppresses itch, while chronic stress exacerbates it. These effects are mediated by neural circuits within the brain, though the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of neurons in the stress-sensitive lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) in modulating itch. Using neural activity-dependent genetic labeling and chemogenetic tools, we selectively engaged a population of LHA neurons (LHAstress-TRAP neurons) responsive to stress. Transient stimulation of these neurons induced anxiety-like behaviors, conditioned place aversion, and suppressed acute (chloroquine-induced) and chronic (psoriatic) itch. Conversely, the inhibition of the LHAstress-TRAP neurons enhanced acute and chronic itch. Interestingly, LHAstress-TRAP neurons did not respond to acute itch stimuli, but their activity was temporally correlated with scratching episodes in mice with psoriasis. Ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that these neurons exhibit heightened excitability in psoriatic animals. Anterograde viral tracing demonstrated that LHAstress-TRAP neurons project to brainstem regions implicated in itch modulation, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and optogenetic silencing of LHAstress-TRAP axon terminals revealed that bidirectional modulation of itch is primarily mediated through projections to the PAG.

Dysregulation of NMDA receptor activity is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. While excessive GluN2A-mediated signalling can lead to hyperexcitability and seizure generation, loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2A, which result in reduced GluN2A expression, have also been identified in patients with various forms of epilepsy, including focal epilepsies and epileptic encephalopathies. This paradox highlights the complexity of NMDA receptor contributions to network excitability and suggests that both gain- and loss-of-function mutations can be pathogenic. However, the mechanisms through which reduced GluN2A expression influences seizure susceptibility remains unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of reduced and absence of GluN2A on seizure-like activity using in vitro model system. Hippocampal slices were prepared from wild-type littermate controls (Grin2a+/+), heterozygous (Grin2a+/-) and homozygous (Grin2a-/-) transgenic rats and subjected to pro-convulsant conditions to elicit epileptiform-like events. Specifically, we employed three well established in vitro epilepsy models: (i) 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), (ii) zero-magnesium with elevated potassium (0Mg2+/5K+), and (iii) high-potassium (high-K+). Local field potentials were recorded from the CA1 pyramidal layer to quantify interictal and seizure-like activity, by measuring latency to onset, event frequency, and duration. Spectral analyses were also conducted to assess alterations in network dynamics. Our findings reveal that reduced GluN2A expression alters the susceptibility of hippocampal circuits to seizure-like activity in a model-dependent manner. In the 4-AP model, Grin2a-/- slices exhibited a significantly lower frequency of interictal events and a delayed onset of seizure-like activity relative to both wild-type and heterozygous slices. In the 0Mg2+/5K+ model, both Grin2a+/- and Grin2a-/- slices displayed reduced seizure susceptibility compared to wild-type. Finally, in the high-K+ model, Grin2a-/- slices showed a reduced incidence of seizure-like events compared to wild-type controls when extracellular potassium concentration was increased to 7.5 mM, although this effect was less apparent at higher concentrations (9.5 mM). These results suggest that partial or complete loss of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors reduces the propensity of hippocampal networks to develop epileptiform activity, potentially by altering intrinsic or synaptic excitability.

A.", "abstract": "Diversity exists throughout biology, playing an important role in maintaining robustness and stability. The same is true of the brain, as has become increasingly apparent in recent years with the accumulation of datasets of unparalleled resolution. These datasets show widespread neural heterogeneity, spanning cells, circuits and system dynamics, marking it as an unavoidable component of the brain's composition. Recent experiments found declines in heterogeneity amongst neurons may accompany pathological states. While heterogeneity has been linked to stability, robustness and increased computational potential, the loss of biophysical diversity was found conducive to the onset of seizure-like activity, suggesting an important functional role. Despite this, how changes in heterogeneity arise remains unknown. Oftentimes considered a static metaparameter resulting from solely genetic disposition, heterogeneity is, in fact, a highly dynamic property of biological networks arising from various sources. Here, we consider this through the lens of intrinsic plasticity, the activity-dependent modulation of neuron biophysical properties, which we propose allows the degree of biophysical diversity to fluctuate in time. Using a network of Poisson neurons endowed with intrinsic plasticity, we combine analytical and numerical approaches to measure the effect of input statistics on the excitability of individual cells, and how this translates into changes in network heterogeneity at the population scale. Our results indicate that, through intrinsic plasticity, diversity in synaptic inputs promotes heterogeneity in cell-to-cell excitability due to changes in the statistics of presynaptic firing rates, and network topology. In contrast, whenever the statistics of synaptic input between cells were too similar, intrinsic plasticity promoted the decline in heterogeneity. Further, we show that changes in heterogeneity can coexist with degeneracy in the firing rate between neurons. Taken together, understanding how input statistics affect neuronal network heterogeneity may provide key insights into brain function resilience and the manipulability of neural diversity through intrinsic plasticity.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}

E.; Janssen, J.; Chao, A.; Vergassola, M.; Blythe, S. A.; Di Talia, S.", "abstract": "During development, cells must interpret extracellular signals with speed and accuracy. While morphogen gradients pattern tissues, how cells respond to dynamic morphogens remains unclear. Here, we investigate how dorsal patterning in the Drosophila embryo is specified by a rapidly evolving BMP gradient. Using a live reporter of BMP pathway activity and nascent transcription reporters, we find that gene expression is best predicted by time integration of BMP signaling, rather than instantaneous levels. However, in sog mutant embryos with broad BMP activity, integration alone fails to predict gene expression outside the normal domain. We show that the transcription factor Zen lowers the signaling threshold required for activation, enabling integration to drive rapid transcriptional responses even at low BMP levels. Together, these results suggest that cells interpret dynamic morphogen signals through the combined action of temporal integration and spatial competence, providing a framework for robust pattern formation on fast developmental timescales.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": ""}
