As melanoma progression is thought to recapitulate aspects of neural crest cell (NCC) development, understanding embryonic melanocyte specification and lineage fate decisions of closely related NCCs may illuminate the pathways co-opted during disease evolution. Here, we use a mouse model to isolate and sequence Dopachrome tautomerase (Dct) expressing NCCs, the precursors of melanocytes, at two key developmental stages. We classify these lineages and devise a Developmental Gene Module (DGM) scoring system to interrogate lineage state switching in melanoma samples. In bulk transcriptomes, activation of DGMs representing embryonic Schwann Cell Precursors (SCPs), multipotent stem cells, in patient tumors predicts poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Co-activation of SCP and Mesenchymal-like (Mes.) modules further correlates with resistance to MAPK inhibitors. Notably, single-cell analyses reveal that melanoma cells can simultaneously express multiple DGMs, forming hybrid states. Cells in a hybrid Neural/SCP state are enriched in early metastasis and ICI-resistant tumors and are insensitive to inflammatory stimuli. We demonstrate that targeting Hdac2, a histone deacetylase associated with this Neural/SCP hybrid state, promotes a mesenchymal-like state switch, remodels the tumor microenvironment, and sensitizes melanoma cells to TNF and tumors to ICI therapy. Our methodology thus reveals dynamic patterns of lineage state switching correlated with melanoma tumor evolution to drive insight into new therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

S.; Banerjee, A.; Roy, D.", "abstract": "Visual Working Memory (VWM) is a limited-capacity system where working memory items compete for retrieval. Some items are maintained in the working memory in the region of direct access, which holds information readily available for processing, while other items are in a passive or activated long-term memory state and require cognitive control. Moreover, their recognition requires moving from the most active template in VWM to another one with the shift of attention. Stimulus properties based on similarity can link items together, which can facilitate their retrieval due to prioritization. To investigate the neural dynamics of differential processing of repeated versus not repeated items in working memory, we designed a modified Sternberg task for testing recognition in a VWM based EEG study where human participants respond to a probe for an item's presence or absence in the representation of an encoded memory array containing repeated and not repeated items. Significantly slower response times and comparatively poor accuracy for recognising not-repeated items suggest that they are not prioritized. We identified specific differences in spectral perturbations for sensor clusters in the power of different frequency bands as the neural correlate of probe matching for not-repeated vs. repeated conditions, reflecting biased access to VWM items. For not-repeated item probe matching, delay in beta desynchronization suggests poor memory-guided action selection behaviour. An increase in frontal theta and parietal alpha power demonstrated a demand for stronger cognitive control for retrieving items for not-repeated probe matching by shielding them from distracting repeated items. In summary, our study provides crucial empirical evidence of facilitation and prioritization of repeated items over non-repeated items and explains the probable role of different EEG rhythms in facilitated recognition of repeated items over goal-relevant, not-repeated items in VWM.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Specifically, 'language regions' are connectivity hubs, coordinating varying peripheral activity that averages out following thresholding. We tested this with neuroimaging meta-analyses and movie-fMRI. Results show that words localise to 'language regions' when averaged but are distributed throughout the brain when examining specific linguistic representations. These 'language regions' are partially connectivity hubs that are spatiotemporally dynamic, making connections with ~40% of the brain periphery outside those regions, and only appearing in the aggregate over time. Hub-periphery connections encode linguistic representations, not the 'language regions' alone. Results replicate with audiobook-fMRI. Finally, intracranial neuronal recordings support findings, showing 'language regions' are hub-like, with linguistic representations decodable throughout the brain.

Our main contribution is a simple mathematical relation that constrains the propagation of gene expression noise through biochemical reaction networks. This relation allows us to rigorously interpret fluctuation data even when only a small part of a complex gene regulatory process can be observed. We show how this relation can, in theory, be exploited to detect causal interactions by synthetically engineering a passive reporter of gene expression, akin to the established \"dual reporter assay\".

L.; Tang, J.; Xie, Y.", "abstract": "Motivation: Fluorescent microscopy imaging is vital to capturing single-cell spatial data, characterizing tissue organization and facilitating comprehensive analysis of cellular state. Advancements in fluorescent microscopy imaging technologies have enabled precise downstream cellular analysis, particularly in cell segmentation. Accurate segmentation of individual cells allows better profiling and understanding of cell properties and behaviors. The majority of existing segmentation methods predominantly concentrate on enhancing segmentation algorithms, and their effectiveness strongly relies on the input stained image quality. Factors such as high cellular density, indistinct cell boundaries, and staining artifacts can result in uneven and low-quality staining, particularly causing missing or unclear membrane staining. These artifacts adversely impact the efficacy of the subsequent cell segmentation methods.Results: To tackle this insufficient membrane staining, we propose a novel approach, MEM-GAN, to generate high-quality membranes for cells with missing or weak membranes. Inspired by advanced style transfer techniques in computer vision, MEM-GAN styles the content of the cells with missing or weak membranes into cells with integrated membrane staining. Considering the differences in membrane morphology between epithelial/tumor cells and immune cells, MEM-GAN deals with tumor and immune cells separately, not only enhancing membrane staining for cells with partially weak membrane signals but also generating membranes for cells with only nuclear channels. The proposed MEM-GAN is evaluated using the publicly available CosMx dataset. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in image staining quality, more accurate representation of membrane morphology characteristics, and better performance in downstream segmentation tasks. MEM-GAN is flexibly adapted and applied to other spatially resolved transcriptomics datasets, such as MERFISH and FISHseq. Our work provides a new perspective on tackling the challenges in cell segmentation from fluorescent microscopy image restoration.

The cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I detects viral double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and endogenous polymerase III transcripts carrying a 5'-triphosphate (5'-ppp) or 5'-diphosphate (5'-pp) moiety, triggering phosphorylation of IRF3 and IFN immune response. While many viral RNAs initiate with 5'-ppp-adenosine (5'-pppA) and most endogenous Pol III transcripts in higher eukaryotes start with 5'-ppp-guanosine (5'-pppG), no apparent reason for this bias has been identified so far. Here we demonstrate that dsRNAs initiating with 5'-pppA trigger stronger RIG-I/IFN response than those starting with 5'-pppG. We show that several GTP-binding proteins interact preferentially with 5'-pppG RNAs. Finally, supplementation with guanosine, but not adenosine, which rapidly increases intracellular concentrations of GTP and ATP, respectively, eliminates the difference in immunogenicity between 5'-pppG and 5'-pppA RNAs.

Here we propose that tracking temporally structured neural fluctuations or volatility in brain areas during naturalistic tasks provides a more salient characterization of ageing trajectories compared to measures based on mean and resting-state variability. Compared to other prefrontal regions, the orbitofrontal cortices (OFC) exhibit higher BOLD signal variability in aged individuals. Neural latent state analysis revealed that, in contrast to the stable representations in younger adults, the OFC in older adults exhibited more temporally distorted representations, mirroring their distinct affective experiences. Furthermore, lower OFC volatility during the movie was associated with participant bias toward positive responses in a separate emotional reactivity task. This suggests orbitofrontal neural volatility might be a general adaptive response to affective computations. To investigate this further, a Bayesian learning model of valence dynamics was employed, which revealed that older adults exhibit heightened uncertainty in neural representations while estimating affective states. Collectively, these results indicate that neural volatility identified through BOLD variability carries unique information about older adult affective experiences and how naturalistic neuroimaging can chart a way forward in understanding this better.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to identify a potential neurocognitive mechanism for perceptual error, in order to inform intervention strategies to reduce such errors in practice. These experiments evaluated the relationship between brain network activation states and radiologists perceptual errors on two distinct visual tasks utilizing functional MRI (fMRI) and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRs). Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out with two fMRI experiments conducted on radiologist participants utilizing distinct types of visual tasks: the first requiring their continuous attention and the second task requiring visual search. For the first experiment, two modalities of functional brain imaging, functional MRI (fMRI) and functional Near-Infrared Spectrosocpic Imaging (fNIRs) were utilized. The second experiment was performed using fMRI alone, supplemented with eye-tracking. A third experiment using fNIRs alone was an observational study of subjects neurocognitive states during their usual practice. Results: A nearly fourfold increased risk of false-negative (FN) errors (misses) was demonstrated in the presence of a particular error-prone neurocognitive state (EPS) involving simultaneous co-activation of elements of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Frontoparietal Network (FPN) of cerebral connectivity. We also found a high prevalence of the EPS in radiologists performing their normal interpretive tasks in their actual practice setting. Conclusion: Our results suggest that dynamic interactions between brain networks leading to a particular error-prone state (EPS) may underlie a substantial fraction of radiologists perceptual errors. We demonstrate that this EPS can be detected unobtrusively in the clinical setting. These results suggest potential intervention strategies for perceptual error, the largest class of radiologist errors in practice.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

K.; Dionne, U.; Bradley, D.; Landry, C. R.", "abstract": "In signaling networks, protein-protein interactions are often mediated by modular domains that bind short linear motifs. The motifs' sequences affect many factors, among them affinity and specificity, or the ability to bind strongly and to the appropriate partners. Using Deep Mutational Scanning to create a mutant library, and protein complementation assays to measure protein-protein interactions, we determined the in vivo binding strength of a library of mutants of a binding motif on the MAP kinase kinase Pbs2, which binds the SH3 domain of the osmosensor protein Sho1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These measurements were made using the full-length endogenous proteins, in their native cellular environment. We find that along with residues within the canonical motif, many mutations in the residues neighboring the motif also modulate binding strength. Interestingly, all Pbs2 mutations which increase binding are situated outside of the Pbs2 region that interacts with the canonical SH3 binding pocket, suggesting that other surfaces on Sho1 contribute to binding. We use predicted structures and mutations to propose a model of binding which involves residues neighboring the canonical Pbs2 motif binding outside of the canonical SH3 binding pocket. We compared this predicted structure with known structures of SH3 domains binding peptides through residues outside of the motif, and put forth possible mechanisms through which Pbs2 can bind specifically to Sho1. We propose that for certain SH3 domain-motif pairs, affinity and specificity are determined by a broader range of sequences than what has previously been considered, potentially allowing easier differentiation between otherwise similar partners.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

These decisions are influenced not only by the availability and quality of food but also by the internal state of the animal, which needs to compute and give weights to these different variables before making a choice. Feeding preferences of female mosquitoes exemplify this behavioural plasticity. Both male and female mosquitoes usually feed on carbohydrate-rich sources of nectar or sap, but the female also feeds on blood, which is essential for egg development. This blood-appetite is modulated across the female's reproductive cycle, yet little is known about the factors that bring it about. We show that mated, but not virgin Anopheles stephensi females, a major vector of urban malaria in the Indian sub-continent and West-Africa, suppress blood-feeding between a blood-meal and oviposition. We identify several candidate genes through transcriptomics of blood-deprived and -sated An. stephensi central brains that could modulate this behaviour. We show that short Neuropeptide-F (sNPF) and RYamide (RYa) act together to promote blood-feeding and identify a cluster of cells in the subesophageal zone that expresses sNPF transcripts only in the blood-hungry state. Such females also have more sNPF transcripts in their midguts. Based on these data, we propose a model where increased sNPF levels in the brain and gut promotes a state of blood-hunger, which drives feeding behaviour either by sNPF 's action in the two tissues independently or via a communication between them.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Prior research suggests that in single-talker scenarios, the neural encoding of linguistic units follows a hierarchy of increasing temporal receptive windows. Shorter temporal units like phonemes and syllables are encoded by lower-level sensory brain regions, whereas longer units such as sentences and paragraphs are processed by higher-level perceptual and cognitive areas. However, the brain's representation of these linguistic units under challenging listening conditions, such as a cocktail party situation, remains unclear. In this study, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) responses from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired participants as they listened to individual and dual speakers narrating different parts of a story. The inclusion of hearing-impaired listeners allowed us to examine how hierarchically organized linguistic units in competing speech streams affect comprehension abilities. We leveraged a hierarchical language model to extract linguistic information at multiple levels--phoneme, syllable, word, phrase, and sentence--and aligned these model activations with the EEG data. Our findings showed distinct neural responses to dual-speaker speech between the two groups. Specifically, compared to normal-hearing listeners, hearing-impaired listeners exhibited poorer model fits at the acoustic, phoneme, and syllable levels as well as the sentence levels, but not at the word and phrase levels.

We use fMRI data from a cohort undergoing deep propofol anaesthesia to investigate resting state dynamics using dynamic brain state models and spatiotemporal network analysis. We focus our analysis on group-level dynamics of brain state temporal complexity, functional activity, connectivity and spatiotemporal modularization in deep anaesthesia and wakefulness. We find that in contrast to the wakeful condition, anaesthesia dynamics are dominated by a handful of sink states that act as low-complexity attractors to which subjects repeatedly return. On a subject-level, our analysis provides tentative evidence that these low complexity attractor states appear to depend on subject-specific age and anaesthesia susceptibility factors.

The levels of total 5mC vary enormously between different species, and the DNA methyltransferases that introduce 5mC have been repeatedly lost in several independent lineages. DNA methyltransferases are a threat to genomic stability due to the increased mutagenicity of 5mC bases and the propensity of DNA methyltransferases themselves to introduce DNA alkylation damage as an off-target effect. However, whether alkylation damage explains why 5mC is frequently lost in evolution is unclear. Here we tested the fitness consequences of DNA methyltransferase-induced alkylation damage by introducing a eukaryotic-like 5mC system into E. coli. We showed that introducing 5mC genome-wide leads to increased sensitivity to alkylating agents, which is strongly enhanced by removal of the 3mC repair enzyme AlkB. Unexpectedly, we discovered that 5mC introduction led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. We showed that this is due to increased formation of reactive oxygen in the presence of 5mC. We determined that reactive oxygen species led to non-enzymatic oxidation of 5mC, producing modified cytosines such as 5fC that are recognised as DNA base damage in E. coli. Overall, our work identifies increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, as well as alkylating agents, as a negative consequence of genome-wide 5mC.

The spatial pattern of the EEG spectral power at 6 Hz was similarly extracted and subjected to a moving-window MVPA decoding analysis to index the temporal dynamics of processing pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant distractor pictures. We found that (1) both target processing and distractor processing exhibited rhythmicity at ~1 Hz and (2) the phase difference between the two rhythmic time courses were related to task performance, i.e., relative phase closer to {pi} predicted a higher rate of coherent motion detection whereas relative phase closer to 0 predicted a lower rate of coherent motion detection. These results suggest that (1) in a target-distractor scenario, both attended and distracting information were sampled rhythmically and (2) the more target sampling and distractor sampling were separated in time within a sampling cycle, the less distraction effects were observed, both at the neural and the behavioral level.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

With the advent of novel gene-editing technologies and artificial intelligence, there is an apparent research need for high-spatial-resolution maps of rat hypothalamic neurochemical cell types to aid in their gene-directed targeting, to validate their expression in transgenic lines, or to supply precious ground-truth training data for machine learning algorithms. Here, we present Chemopleth 1.0 [available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15788189], a chemoarchitecture database for the rat hypothalamus (HY) and zona incerta (ZI), which features downloadable interactive maps featuring the census distributions of five immunoreactive neurochemical systems: (1) vasopressin (as detected from its gene co-product, copeptin); (2) neuronal nitric oxide synthase (EC 1.14.13.39); (3) hypocretin 1/orexin A; (4) melanin-concentrating hormone; and (5) alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. These maps are formatted for the widely used Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4.0) open-access rat brain atlas (RRID:SCR_017314). Importantly, this dataset retains atlas stereotaxic coordinates that facilitate the precise targeting of the cell bodies and/or axonal fibers of these neurochemical systems, thereby potentially serving to streamline delivery of viral vectors for gene-directed manipulations. The maps are presented together with novel open-access tools to visualize the data, including a new workflow to quantify cell positions and fiber densities for BM4.0. The workflow produces heat maps of neurochemical distributions from multiple subjects: 1) isopleth maps that represent consensus distributions independent of underlying atlas boundary conditions, and 2) choropleth maps that provide distribution differences based on cytoarchitectonic boundaries. The database files, generated using the Adobe Illustrator vector graphics environment, can also be opened using the free vector graphics editor, Inkscape. We also introduce a refined grid-based coordinate system for this dataset, register it with previously published spatial data for the HY and ZI, and introduce novel grid-based annotation of experimental observations. This database provides critical spatial targeting information for these neurochemical systems unavailable from mRNA-based maps and allows readers to place their own datasets in register with them. It also provides a space for the continued buildout of a community-driven atlas-based spatial model of rat hypothalamic chemoarchitecture, allowing experimental observations from multiple laboratories to be registered to a common spatial framework.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

For example, the ISR regulates developmental axonogenesis, learning and memory, and synaptic plasticity in the brain. One barrier to uncovering ISR roles in health and disease is the challenge of monitoring its activity. The transient nature of regulatory phosphorylation events and lack of transgenic ISR reporter mouse lines make visually capturing the molecular hallmarks of ISR activation in specific cell types especially difficult. We recently developed the SPOTlight (Selective Phospho-eIF2alpha Open reading frame Tracking light) reporter, which uniquely provides a readout of the functional state of protein synthesis initiation dynamics that are regulated by the ISR. Here, we report the generation of a transgenic mouse line with Cre-dependent expression of SPOTlight. This resource enables selective visualization of ISR-regulated functional activity across genetically defined cell populations body-wide. Using a pan-neuronal Cre line (Nestin-Cre), we demonstrate the reporter's performance and applications for cell-specific discovery, live tissue assessments and quantitative comparisons across broad physical space. We also specifically investigated the extent to which the property of steady-state basal ISR activation, recently described in dorsal striatal cholinergic interneurons, extends to other classes of cholinergic neurons and provide a CNS-wide atlas of SPOTlight activity in these cells.

Of the 80 repair proteins identified, 72 proteins were previously unreported repair protein candidates. Among the observed repair processes, the polarized exocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) are coupled at the damage site, with exocytosis predominating in the early stage of PM repair and CME predominating in the late stage of PM repair. Furthermore, we showed that CME at the growing bud site directs PM repair proteins with transmembrane domains to the damage site. We propose a model in which CME delivers repair proteins with transmembrane domains between the growing bud site and the damage site.

In these polypeptides, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine act as key ``sticker'' residues, driving the cohesion of dense phases. Recent studies on condensates suggest a hierarchy in sticker strength, with tyrosine being more adhesive than phenylalanine. This hierarchy aligns with experimental data on amino acid solubilities and potentials of mean force derived from atomistic simulations. However, it contradicts conventional chemical intuition based on hydrophobicity scales and pairwise contact statistics from experimental structures of proteins, which suggest phenylalanine should be the stronger sticker. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry calculations to resolve this apparent discrepancy. Using simple model peptides and side-chain analogues, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed hierarchy arises from the lower free energy of transfer of tyrosine into the condensate, mediated by both stronger protein-protein interactions and solvation effects in the condensate environment. Notably, as the dielectric constant of the media surrounding the stickers approaches that of an apolar solvent, the trend reverses, and phenylalanine becomes the stronger sticker. These findings highlight the role of the chemical environment in modulating protein-protein interactions, providing a clear explanation for the crossover in sticker strength between tyrosine and phenylalanine in different media.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Cryo-EM structures of brain-derived tau filaments revealed that specific structures define different diseases, triggering a quest for the development of experimental model systems that replicate the structures of disease. Here, we describe twelve phosphomimetic, serine/threonine to aspartate, mutations in tau, which we termed PAD12, that collectively induce the in vitro assembly of full-length tau into filaments with the same structure as that of paired helical filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau may facilitate filament formation by disrupting an intramolecular interaction between two IVYK motifs. PAD12 tau can be used for both nucleation-dependent and multiple rounds of seeded assembly in vitro, as well as for the seeding of tau biosensor cells. PAD12 tau can be assembled into paired helical filaments under various shaking conditions, with the resulting filaments being stable for extended periods of time. They can be labelled with fluorophores and biotin. Tau filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease have been known to be made of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated full-length tau, but it was not known if the presence of this post-translational modification is more than a mere correlation. Our findings suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau may be sufficient for the formation of the Alzheimer tau fold.

Microanatomical and molecular differences in homologous neurons, those with similar locations and developmental origins across species, are best characterized in the neocortical mantle, the center of complex brain functions; however, the purpose of these differences remains unclear. We performed whole-cell microelectrode recordings along with microanatomical and molecular analyses of human fast-spiking parvalbumin (pvalb)-expressing interneurons in neocortical tissue resected during brain surgery, comparing them with similar data obtained from the mouse neocortex. The action potential (AP) firing threshold was lower in human neurons than in mouse neurons. This was due to a deficiency in low-voltage-activated inhibitory Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 potassium channels in the axon initial segment (AIS), a specialized axonal region that determines AP threshold and initiation, in human cells. In contrast, Kv1 ion channels were prominent in mouse neurons. The AIS was also elongated in humans. Computational simulations of fast-spiking interneurons revealed that the human-type AIS lowers the AP threshold and shortens the time lag for AP initiation. We found that the low membrane AP firing threshold in pvalb neurons is closely linked to slow membrane potential kinetics in the soma. Thus, the human AIS supports fast in-fast out circuit function in human pvalb neurons, compensating for electrically slow somatic membrane responses. When formulating therapeutic strategies that involve fast-spiking neurons, it is crucial to take into account the molecular and functional species differences.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

CAM has evolved repeatedly across vascular plants, suggesting its emergence may depend on relatively simple changes to deeply conserved regulatory mechanisms. Modern CAM research relies heavily on the interpretation of transcriptomic data. This approach may bias mechanistic explanations of CAM toward transcriptional regulation, though regulation is known to occur at multiple levels following transcription. Additionally, while the majority of research to date has focused on a handful of genes and metabolites in the core CAM pathway, the co-option of conserved regulatory and functional genes is bound to have wide ranging effects on other aspects of primary metabolism. Thus, taking a broad and integrative approach to understanding the downstream effects associated with the emergence of CAM is essential to explaining its convergent evolution as well as to efforts to engineer carbon concentrating mechanisms in crops. In this study, we integrate genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data to compare primary metabolism between the CAM species Yucca aloifolia and closely related C3 species, Y. filamentosa. We observe minimal correlation between protein abundance and mRNA expression, suggesting significant post-transcriptional regulation in CAM species. We also find evidence of shifts in gene expression and metabolite accumulation outside of the central CAM pathway suggesting that the shift to CAM has cascading effects across primary metabolism, especially nitrogen metabolism. Our findings provide insights into the metabolic shifts associated with CAM evolution and highlight the complexity of its regulation at multiple biological levels.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

In a genealogical context, this recombination-mediated information reflects the persistence of ancestral haplotypes across local genealogical trees in which they do not represent coalescences. We show how these non-coalescing haplotypes (``locally-unary nodes'') may be inserted into ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs), a compact but information-rich data structure describing the genealogical relationships among recombinant sequences. The resulting ARGs are smaller, faster to compute with, and the additional ancestral information that is inserted is nearly always correct where the initial ARG is correct. We provide efficient algorithms to infer locally-unary nodes within existing ARGs, and explore some consequences for ARGs inferred from real data.

Recent experiments suggest that this mechanism also controls the clustering of eukaryotic chromosomes during the late stages of cell division. In this process, inter-chromosome attraction is driven by the condensation of cytoplasmic RNA and Ki-67, a charged intrinsically disordered protein that coats the chromosomes as a brush. Attraction between chromosomes has been shown to be specifically promoted by a localized charged patch on Ki-67, although the physical mechanism remains unclear. To elucidate this process, we combine here coarse-grained simulations and analytical theory to study the RNA-mediated interaction between charged polymer brushes on the chromosome surfaces. We show that the charged patch on Ki-67 leads to inter-chromosome attraction via RNA bridging between the two brushes, whereby the RNA preferentially interacts with the charged patches, leading to stable, long-range forces. By contrast, if the brush is uniformly charged, bridging is basically absent due to complete adsorption of RNA onto the brush. Moreover, the RNA dynamics becomes caged in presence of the charged patch, while remaining diffusive with uniform charge. Our work sheds light on the physical origin of chromosome clustering, while also suggesting a general mechanism for cells to tune work production by biomolecular condensates via different charge distributions.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Recent advancements in sequencing technologies and deep-learning strategies have paved the way for generating and exploiting an ever-growing wealth of antibody repertoire data. The self-supervised nature of protein language models (PLMs) has demonstrated the ability to learn complex representations of antibody sequences and has been leveraged for a wide range of applications including diagnostics, structural modeling, and antigen-specificity predictions. PLM-derived likelihoods have been used to improve antibody affinities in vitro, raising the question of whether PLMs can capture and predict features of B cell selection in vivo. Here, we explore how general and antibody-specific PLM-generated sequence pseudolikelihoods (SPs) relate to features of in vivo B cell selection such as expansion, isotype usage, and somatic hypermutation (SHM) at single-cell resolution. Our results demonstrate that the type of PLM and the region of the antibody input sequence significantly affect the generated SP. Contrary to previous in vitro reports, we observe a negative correlation between SPs and binding affinity, whereas repertoire features such as SHM and isotype usage were strongly correlated with SPs. By constructing evolutionary lineage trees of B cell clones from human and mouse repertoires, we observe that SHMs are routinely among the most likely mutations suggested by PLMs and that mutating residues have lower absolute likelihoods than conserved residues. Our findings highlight the potential of PLMs to predict features of antibody selection and further suggest their potential to assist in antibody discovery and engineering.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

In the cortex, while peaking in the ACC, activity associated with time on task was extensive, also including activity decrements outside the default mode network, primarily involving motor and somatosensory regions. Information about reward levels was carried in the ventral striatum, consistent with its motivational role, but did not reflect trade-offs with increasing efforts during time on task. Instead, the ventral tegmental area and parts of the basal forebrain (BF) corresponding to the cholinergic Ch4 nuclei increased in activity with time on task and were sensitive to reward levels.

In this study, we utilized the ESM2 protein language model to map the residue-level mutational tolerance landscapes landscape of IDRs. Our findings reveal that IDRs, particularly those actively participating in phase separation, contain conserved amino acids. This conservation is evident through mutational constraints predicted by ESM2 and supported by direct analyses of multiple sequence alignments. These conserved, disordered amino acids include residues traditionally identified as ``stickers\" as well as ``spacers\" and frequently form continuous sequence motifs.

We used spectrophotometry, behavioral experiments, visual modeling and chemical analyses to characterize the evolution of visual and chemical traits in two closely-related species, Morpho helenor and Morpho achilles. We specifically compared trait variation between samples from allopatric and sympatric populations of M. helenor to test the effect of ecological interactions with M. achilles on trait evolution.

We found a strong similarity in iridescence between M. helenor and M. achilles in sympatry while the iridescence of M. helenor diverged in allopatry, suggesting that predation favors local resemblance. Although intraspecific behavioral experiments showed that iridescent signals could be used as visual cues during intraspecific mate choice, the strong resemblance of the iridescent signals between species may impair these species visual recognition.

We sought comprehensively to describe the cardiac phenotype of DE50-MD dogs, a novel dystrophin-deficient model that harbours a mutation within the principal DMD mutational hotspot. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiographic studies were performed at approximately 12-week intervals in male, 3- to 18-month-old DE50-MD (n=17) and age-matched littermates, wild type (WT, n=14) dogs. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging was performed in a subpopulation of DE50-MD (n=10) and WT (n=11) dogs aged 9 to 18 months. The DE50-MD dogs had smaller left ventricular (LV) mass and LV dimensions than WT dogs. While global ventricular systolic function was preserved, DE50-MD dogs showed early differences in strain and strain rate parameters.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is invaluable for identification of subclinical myocardial abnormalities, to stratify disease and to identify patients needing early therapeutic intervention. The dystrophin-deficient DE50-MD canine model harbours a mutation in the major hot spot region for mutations in DMD patients and mimics the preclinical cardiac and skeletal muscle of DMD boys. We performed serial parametric (T1, T2 and extracellular volume) mapping and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) studies to characterise myocardial pathology in 15-to-36-month-old DE50-MD, (n=8) and wild type (WT, n=6) dogs. In 6/8 DE50-MD dogs left ventricular (LV) subepicardial LGE identified myocardial fibrofatty infiltration, (confirmed with histopathology post-mortem) with the characteristic distribution reported in DMD cardiomyopathy. Parametric mapping techniques exposed diffuse myocardial pathology that was most pronounced in DE50-MD dogs of 30 months and older and supported extracellular matrix expansion due to fibrosis, with or without regional myocardial oedema and /or fatty infiltration in individual dogs. All CMR markers of fibrosis worsened with age in DE50-MD dogs and paralleled deterioration in ventricular function evaluated with conventional and speckle tracking (circumferential strain) echocardiography, the burden of fragmented QRS complexes in 12-lead electrocardiography studies and the severity of pathological lesions. LGE and parametric mapping studies accurately identified a spectrum of myocardial abnormalities encountered in young DE50-MD dogs, further validating the relevance of these dogs as a preclinical model of DMD cardiomyopathy.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Cetaceans, as key indicator species of marine ecosystems, face increasing threats from human activities, highlighting the need for effective, non-invasive monitoring methods. In the present study, we developed novel Cetacea-specific primer sets to enhance the detection efficiency of cetacean species through environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, while minimizing the amplification of non-target vertebrates, such as fish and humans. We retrieved mitochondrial genomes of 71 cetacean species from a public database and designed 20 candidate primer sets, which were assessed in silico for their specificity and capacity to differentiate cetacean sequences. Four primer sets with the best in silico performance were selected for empirical validation using DNA from tissue samples and eDNA from seawater collected from aquarium pools and Hong Kong coastal waters. All four primer sets effectively amplified cetacean DNA from tissue samples. However, in the aquarium pool tests, three primer sets failed to accurately identify one or more cetacean species due to a lack of interspecific variation within the amplified region. From these, we selected one primer set targeting a 267 bp region of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene, named Ceta, and applied it to water samples collected from Hong Kong coastal waters, where the iconic Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) was observed. Ceta successfully detected S. chinensis eDNA while avoiding amplification of non-target species such as fish or humans.

Leveraging human pluripotent stem cell-derived lung organoids, animal models, and clinical specimens, we elucidate that RAS cells arise from distal lung progenitors and exhibit context-dependent immune competence. Upon viral or bacterial challenge, RAS cells display interferon-mediated or TLR5-dependent defense responses, respectively. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, they produce elevated adaptive immune responses. Notably, complement C3 is upregulated under these conditions and is suppressed by a selective TLR5 inhibitor.

However, how adaptive TEs arise in populations and historical contingencies affect TE dynamics remains unknown. Fungal pathogens in agriculture provide unique frameworks to address such questions due to the availability of spatially explicit sampling and well-characterized niche conditions. We characterised TE evolutionary dynamics using an extensive intraspecies sampling of 1,953 genomes across the global distribution range of the major fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Employing a pangenomic approach, we characterise genomic diversity and benchmark methods to robustly infer TE insertion polymorphism, before systematically assessing TEs as a source of adaptive variation. We annotated ~3.2 million TE loci among genomes, finding substantial variation in TE content within and among populations. TE activity surged during the pathogen's expansion from its centre of origin in the Middle East, with unique TE activity profiles arising in derived populations. TE-mediated adaptation emerged from distinct waves of TE mobilization. The highest rates of TE activity were observed over timescales as short as 25 years. 45 TE loci showing local adaptation signatures within 1kb of 49 host genes were identified, with adaptive TE insertions likely related to adaptation to antifungals and the plant host environment. This work highlights the power of vast genomic datasets to unravel intraspecies TE invasion histories and pinpoint factors likely driving recent adaptation. This argues for a shift in focus to incorporate deep population-level TE activity surveys in our pursuit to uncover the molecular drivers of adaptive evolution.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Here we use the Drosophila larva to investigate this form-function problem focusing on the mapping of the regional stimuli that trigger an adaptive and evolutionarily conserved behaviour termed self-righting: a postural control system that allows the animal to restore its natural position if turned upside-down. Through the development of new methodologies that allow regionally-restricted mechanical stimulation and region-specific neuronal optogenetics, we find that multidendritic sensory neuron inhibition in anterior areas (thoracic/anterior abdominal) has a profound effect on self-righting performance, whilst inhibition of posterior sensory elements (mid and posterior abdomen) produces no effects. Examination of how neuronal inhibition impacts the self-righting sequence using a neural network tracking method revealed that inhibition of anterior sensory neurons increases head casting behaviour, and that this is strongly correlated with abnormally long self-righting times. Furthermore, to explore the mechanistic bases of our behavioural observations, we considered the hypothesis that the Hox genes, well known for their roles in axial developmental patterning, might play a role in the functional specification of multidendritic sensory neurons along the body axis. Molecular expression analysis of FACS-sorted neural populations, fluorescent immunolabelling and neuron-specific knock-down experiments demonstrate that normal sensory neuron expression of the Hox genes Antennapedia and Abdominal-b is necessary for self-righting in the Drosophila larva. Altogether, our work shows that region-specific mechanosensory processes mediated by multidendritic sensory neurons and instructed via Hox gene inputs are essential for self-righting, providing a link between regional structural features and an adaptive and widely evolutionarily conserved postural control behaviour.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Our results reveal substantial heterogeneity in the degree of genomic differentiation between marine and freshwater populations. The strongest candidate loci were two SNPs near dopamine receptor genes (Drd4a and Drd2l), which were repeatedly differentiated between marine and freshwater habitats. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of candidate genes showed enrichment for functions related to nervous system development and dopamine receptor activity. These findings suggest a more complex evolutionary history for Atlantic stickleback populations than previously recognized, potentially involving multiple colonization events or ongoing gene flow.

However, for fitness prediction, language model performance declines beyond a certain size, raising concerns about their scalability. Here, we showed that model size, training dataset, and stochastic elements can bias the predicted p(sequence) away from real fitness. Model performance on fitness prediction depends on how well p(sequence) matches evolutionary patterns in homologs, which is best achieved at a moderate p(sequence) level for most proteins. At extreme predicted wild-type sequence likelihoods, models predict uniformly low or high likelihoods for nearly all mutations, failing to reflect the real fitness landscape. Notably, larger models tend to predict proteins with higher p(sequence), which may exceed the moderate range and thus reduce performance. Our findings clarify the scaling behavior of protein models on fitness prediction and provide practical guidelines for selecting and improving them.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

There is usually substantial microbiome variation between different plant individuals and populations, and the drivers of this variation are still poorly understood, particularly in wild plants. Here, we were interested in the potential for plant genotype and plant age to explain intraspecific variation in the plant microbiome. In seven natural populations, we genotyped a total of 168 plants over four years, determined their ages through herb chronology, and then sequenced their root, shoot, flower and seed microbiomes. We found that plant genotypes differed both in the diversity and composition of microbes, and that some microbial taxa were associated with particular plant genotypes - a result that we experimentally confirmed for one of the observed genotype-microbe associations. The genotype effects tended to be strongest and most consistent for plant-associated bacteria, with the largest plant genotype differences in the microbiome diversity of flowers and seeds. In contrast to the widespread plant genotype effects, we found less evidence for an effect of plant age on microbiome diversity: the age of plants explained variation in fungi diversity, and it was associated with the abundance of several microbial taxa. Our study indicates that the genotype of a plant and - to a lesser degree its age - influence the diversity and composition of plant-associated microbiota, even in complex natural environments.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

However, a lack of appropriate fluorescent protein fusions has, until now, limited these studies to only a few of the dozens of important transcription factors in the fruit fly gene regulatory network dictating early development. Here, we report the creation of four new fluorescent protein fusions to Dorsal, a member of the NF-{kappa}B/Rel family that initiates dorsal-ventral patterning. We generated and characterized two bright fluorescent protein fusions for Dorsal, meGFP and mNeonGreen, and two photoconvertible fluorescent protein fusions, mEos4a and Dendra2. We show that removal of the DsRed2 cassette commonly used to mark the CRISPR integration restores endogenous Dorsal mRNA and protein levels and enables the fusion allele to rescue a dorsal null allele, meeting the gold standard for endogenous function of a tagged protein in a fruit fly. We then demonstrate that our bright fluorescent protein fusions can be used to dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of stable Dorsal clusters that traverse the nucleoplasm and uncovered that these clusters preferentially interact with active sites of Dorsal-modulated transcription. We further demonstrate that our photoconvertible fluorescent protein fusions make it possible to detect individual molecules of Dorsal in the nuclei of developing embryos.

However, even under carefully controlled conditions, stem cell-derived models exhibit substantial \"inter-individual\" heterogeneity. Focusing on gastruloids, a powerful model of the early posterior embryo1, we sought to investigate the origins of this heterogeneity. To this end, we developed a scalable protocol for generating gastruloids that are monoclonal, i.e. derived from a single mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). Single cell transcriptional profiling of monoclonal gastruloids revealed extensive inter-individual heterogeneity, with some hardly progressing, others resembling conventional gastruloids but biased towards mesodermal or neural lineages, and yet others bearing cell types rare or absent from conventional polyclonal gastruloids. To investigate this further, we leveraged DNA Typewriter2 to record the cell lineage relationships among the mESCs from which monoclonal gastruloids originate. Early in the expansion of \"founder\" mESCsprior to induction of the resulting aggregates to form gastruloidswe observe clear examples of fate bias or fate restriction, i.e. sister clades that exhibit markedly different cell type compositions. In a separate experiment with DNA Typewriter, we reconstructed a monophyletic \"tree of trees\", composed of [~]50,000 cells derived from [~]100 gastruloids, all descended from a single \"founder of founders\" stem cell. From these data, we find that founder mESCs that are more closely related are more likely to give rise to monoclonal gastruloids with similar cell type compositions. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the intrinsic states of mESCs are heritable, and shape their descendants fates across many cell divisions.

Embryoid bodies (EBs) are self-organizing multicellular structures that recapitulate aspects of early mammalian embryogenesis. We set out to perform a CRISPR screen perturbing all transcription factors (TFs) in murine EBs. Specifically, a library of TF-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) was used to generate mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) bearing single TF knockouts. Aggregates of these mESCs were induced to form mouse EBs, such that each resulting EB was mosaic with respect to the TF perturbations represented among its constituent cells. Upon performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on cells derived from mosaic EBs, we found many TF perturbations exhibiting large and seemingly significant effects on the likelihood that individual cells would adopt certain fates, suggesting roles for these TFs in lineage specification. However, to our surprise, these results were not reproducible across biological replicates. Upon further investigation, we discovered cellular bottlenecks during EB differentiation that dramatically reduce clonal complexity, curtailing statistical power and confounding interpretation of mosaic screens. Towards addressing this challenge, we developed a scalable protocol in which each individual EB is monoclonally derived from a single mESC and genetically barcoded. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we show how these monoclonal EBs enable us to better quantify the consequences of TF perturbations as well as inter-individual heterogeneity across EBs harboring the same genetic perturbation. Looking forward, monoclonal EBs and EB-derived organoids may be powerful tools not only for genetic screens, but also for modeling Mendelian disorders, as their underlying genetic lesions are overwhelmingly constitutional (i.e. present in all somatic cells), yet give rise to phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

While there is clear evidence for age-related changes in the quantity of muscle spindles and in their sensitivity, behavioral assessment of age-related changes in position sense have produced mixed findings even though it is taken as textbook knowledge that proprioception declines with age. Yet, study results are difficult to compare since there is no golden standard for assessment of proprioception. Therefore, we measured upper limb proprioception across several standard proprioceptive tasks together with key factors that could influence behavioral results such as touch, motor function, and cognition in 37 young (19-32 years old) and 35 older (53-71 years old) adults. We tested age-related differences in behavioral outcomes and their associations across tasks. Our results showed that age-related effects were variable, ranging from tasks where older participants performed better to tasks where they exhibit large age-related declines. Age-related declines in position sense are outcome-dependent, sometimes requiring large samples to detect small effects. The results were confirmed by meta-analysis based on data from hundreds of participants tested in our laboratory on the exact same tasks. Associations between outcome variables across or within proprioceptive tasks were overall negligible to weak. In conclusion, age-related changes in proprioception are limited in size, task- and outcome-dependent, and current tasks used to assess proprioception do not provide consistent evidence of age-related impairment in upper limb proprioception.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer imaging and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we observe basal dynamics in which the {beta}arr1 C-tail spontaneously releases from the N-domain, transiently adopting an active conformation that can facilitate binding of the phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus. We further demonstrate the importance of an intermediate state of {beta}arr1 arising from spontaneous C-tail release stabilized by the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2. Both PI(4,5)P2 and mutations in the proximal or middle regions of the C-tail shift {beta}arr1 towards a partially released state, revealing an allosteric connection that informs a refined model for {beta}arr activation. In this model, membrane engagement conformationally primes {beta}arrs prior to receptor binding, thereby explaining how {beta}arrs are recruited by diverse GPCRs, even those with limited C-terminal phosphorylation.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Our predictions are able to distinguish which pathogens should have returned already, and deviations from these predictions reveal long-term impacts of pandemic perturbations.

To study the impact of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation in mice in high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and the role of SIRT1, a sirtuin family member, in mediating the NMN response, we administered NMN to mice in drinking water to boost NAD+ in control and in inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse models and performed a combination of metabolic phenotyping, lipid profiling and plasma proteomics in these mice. We discovered that supplementation with NMN mitigated diet induced weight gain by enhancing energy expenditure, corrected dyslipidemia, and reversed perturbations in fasting blood glucose, all in a SIRT1-dependent manner. On the other hand, NMN-induced reductions in fat mass, fluid mass, eWAT and mesenteric WAT were SIRT1 independent. Proteomic approaches in plasma samples using O-Link and mass-spectrometry provided novel insights into key obesity- and NMN-dependent changes in circulating molecules with potential relevance to inflammation, liver function, and dyslipidemia. We discovered SIRT1 dependent and independent alterations in key circulating plasma proteins and identified key metabolic and molecular pathways that were significantly affected by HFD, several of which were reverted by oral NMN administration. Glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism and immune-related pathways are among the most significantly affected changes. Causal analysis of proteomic data suggests that observed effects could be mediated by transcription regulators FBXW7, ADIPOR2 and PRDM16.

To resolve this issue, we employed an integrative framework, analyzing genomic and morphological data from museum specimens to clarify the validity and relationship of these taxa. Our results demonstrate that the MPB lineage, which encompasses M. indoburmanica, is geographically restricted to the southern Himalayas, a range congruent with the type locality of M. aurita and distinct from other M. pentadactyla populations. Genomic analyses confirm this Himalayan lineage diverged ~1.2 Ma and has remained largely isolated since, with only minimal gene flow. Furthermore, morphometric analyses of both cranial and external features, including the aurita holotype, reveal consistent and significant differentiation between the Himalayan lineage and M. pentadactyla sensu stricto. Collectively, this congruent evidence unequivocally supports the revalidation of the Himalayan pangolin as a distinct species, Manis aurita Hodgson, 1836, representing the fifth extant species in the genus.

By imposing coincidence detection with milliseconds temporal resolution onto granule cells, this enhancement of feedforward inhibition makes granule cell activity sparser and their firing patterns decorrelated.

Importantly, BCL-2 inhibitors have yet to be approved for treating PCa patients. Here we first show the selective induction of BCL-2 by AR pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) in both patient specimens and xenograft models. Vectra-based quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence (qmIF) and image mass cytometry (IMC) analyses with single-cell resolution reveal markedly expanded BCL-2+ (AR+ or AR-) PCa cell populations in CRPC.

Epetraborole (EBO), a leucyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor, represents a novel therapeutic approach with a distinct mechanism of action compared to standard-of-care antibiotics. Preclinical studies included MIC determination, pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling, dose range and fractionation studies, and efficacy assessments in a 24-hour post-bacterial challenge model of a murine B. pseudomallei lung infection. EBO demonstrated a clear dose-dependent reduction in lung bacterial burden. Doses [&ge;]200 mg/kg (achieving AUC-2 [~]110 {micro}g{middle dot}h/mL) produced >1.6 log CFU decreases from the start-of-therapy baseline across all ten B. pseudomallei strains. Notably, an AUC-2 of [~]110 {micro}g{middle dot}h/mL was achieved in humans with a 2000 mg IV dose in a phase 1 clincial trial where doses up to 4000 mg per day for 14 days were well tolerated with no serious adverse events or dose-limiting adverse events. When EBO doses of 600, 300 and 100 mg/kg SC were fractionated by once, twice and three times a day against the B. pseudomallei strain NCTC7383, which represents the MIC100 strain, the efficacy indicated that the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) driver of epetraborole is total drug exposure (AUC) rather than peak concentration (Cmax) or time above MIC. The inhibition of leucyl-tRNA synthetase represents a unique molecular target, reducing cross-resistance potential with existing {beta}-lactam antibiotics and enabling combination therapy strategies. These findings substantiate EBO as a promising therapeutic option for clinical melioidosis to improve treatment outcomes. Notably, this study represents the first demonstration of in vivo efficacy against a panel of ten genetically and geographically diverse B. pseudomallei strains in a murine model. This unprecedented breadth of strain coverage provides strong evidence of EBOs robust and strain-independent therapeutic potential.\n\nAuthor SummaryMelioidosis is a life-threatening disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium found in soil and water in tropical regions. It is challenging to treat because it is often resistant to standard antibiotics, requires long courses of therapy, and can relapse even after treatment. New treatment options are urgently needed. Epetraborole is an experimental antibiotic with a novel mechanism that blocks bacterial protein synthesis. In this study, we tested how well epetraborole works in mice infected with B. pseudomallei, using ten different strains of the bacteria collected from geographically diverse regions. This is the first study to test a melioidosis treatment against such a broad panel of B. pseudomallei strains in an animal model. We found that epetraborole significantly reduced bacterial counts in the lungs of infected mice. The antibiotic remained effective even against strains with higher resistance and high bacterial loads 24 hours after infection, showing promise for severe clinical infections. Our findings suggest that epetraborole could be a valuable addition to existing melioidosis treatments, especially in regions with limited therapeutic options.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Accurate measurement of striking forces is essential for evaluation. However, direct measurement of athletes striking forces presents significant practical and safety challenges, necessitating the development of indirect estimation approaches.\n\nMethodA controllable pendulum-based impact testing apparatus was developed to evaluate force attenuation characteristics of Taekwondo body protectors. The system delivered repeatable impacts across varying magnitudes and contact durations to a mannequin equipped with a protector. Simultaneous measurements of input and transmitted forces through the protector enabled direct quantification of attenuation ratios under controlled conditions. To demonstrate practical application, five Taekwondo athletes performed standardized kicks on the instrumented protector setup, allowing estimation of their actual striking forces using the derived attenuation factor.\n\nResultsForce attenuation ratios demonstrated high consistency across impact magnitudes ranging from 300 to 5800 Newtons, with impact duration variations showing minimal influence on attenuation performance. Linear attenuation relationships were established between input and transmitted forces (R2[&ge;] 0.987), enabling derivation of a predictive attenuation factor. Validation testing with the pendulum system showed that the estimated input force trajectories achieved an nRMSE of 3.5%. Averaged across the entire force range, the MAPE was 4.7% for maximum force, 1.4% for impact duration, and 3.5% for impulse. Applying the attenuation factor to standardized kicks performed by five Taekwondo athletes yielded estimated maximum striking forces ranging from approximately 1300 to 1800 Newtons, demonstrating the methods capability to quantify actual forces that would otherwise be difficult to measure directly.\n\nDiscussionThis study establishes the first quantitative characterization of impact attenuation in Taekwondo body protectors, providing a validated attenuation factor for estimating striking forces from transmitted forces.

In this study, we use precise behavioral tracking to investigate the initial phase of object interaction, asking: What motor-sensory strategies support object detection during natural approach? Using high resolution video tracking of rats freely exploring objects under infrared illumination, we analyzed how head and whisker dynamics evolved across sequential contacts. We found that whisker-object interactions converged toward a distinct line, *, within a motor-sensory plane, where small changes in voluntary whisker movements produced large changes in whisker curvature, a sensory correlate of contact force. This convergence was actively controlled, predicted head movements and marked the completion of object approach. Convergence to * was consistent across different objects, suggesting it serves as an invariant motor-sensory contingency for object detection. Proximity to * predicted the emergence of touch-induced pumps, a rapid motor-sensory reflex that further facilitated convergence within a single whisking cycle. Together, these results reveal that object detection is a closed-loop dynamic process, in which animals actively steer motor-sensory dynamics toward a robust detection-optimized state.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Two families of L.p. secreted ubiquitin ligases are instrumental in the maturation of the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV): the SidC/SdcA family, which catalyzes canonical ubiquitination, and the SidE family, which bypasses the E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade and directly conjugates ubiquitin to a target through a phosphoribosyl (PR) linkage. Here, we demonstrate that the coordinated activities of these two effector families generate a hyperstable, ubiquitin-rich structure surrounding the LCV. We propose a model in which an initial wave of SidC/SdcA-mediated canonical ubiquitination around the LCV is further modified by SidE family-driven PR-ubiquitination, resulting in a detergent-resistant \"cloud\". The \"cloud\" is transient, breaking down as infection progresses, suggesting that L.p. reshapes the properties of the proteinaceous shell surrounding the vacuole to meet changing needs throughout its intracellular lifecycle. This unusual structure likely stabilizes and protects the LCV, shielding it from host defense mechanisms during early infection. Our findings reveal cellular consequences of effector interplay during infection and provide a foundation for future studies into the structure and function of the proteinaceous \"cloud\" surrounding the LCV.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

An amphipathic alpha-helix in Brl1 is critical for mediating this fusion during NPC biogenesis. However, the exact roles of Brl1 and Brr6 in the molecular mechanisms of NPC assembly are still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Brr6 operates at both early and late stages of NPC assembly. Its early function is supported by amphipathic alpha-helix mutants that fail to permit nucleoporin recruitment and INM deformation, while mutations in conserved cysteine residues lead to NE herniations and defective membrane fusion. Additionally, the N-terminus of Brl1 interacts with Nic96, likely promoting its recruitment to nascent NPC assembly sites. We further provide evidence that the length of the perinuclear space-spanning region of Brl1 and Brr6 is critical for proper NE fusion during NPC formation. Artificial elongation of this region produces a toxic phenotype marked by Nup82 mislocalisation and severe NE integrity defects. This phenotype supports a model in which Brl1 and Brr6 promote NE fusion following INM deformation, when the distance between the INM and ONM is reduced - a process initiated by nucleoporin assembly on the nuclear side of the INM.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Physiologists are equally drawn to the implications of individual variation for health and sporting endeavours, and specifically, whether or not a physiological trait is repeatable within an individual. Experimental biologists are especially interested in temporally stable physiological traits that are relevant to an individual's lifetime fitness for natural selection to act upon. Experimental noise, however, confounds the measurement of such repeatability, even though validated protocols exist for measuring many meaningful physiological performance traits. Missing is a decision matrix that helps distinguish individual variation from experimental noise. We propose a precision-&-repeatability assessment matrix (PRAM) that integrates established assessments of individual variability and repeatability. This matrix places metrics that are more repeatable and precise in the quadrant closest to the origins of Cartesian coordinates; those farthest away are less acceptable in terms of both repeatability and precision. As a case study, PRAM is applied to whole-organism aerobic and non-aerobic metabolic performance metrics from fish that were measured with the same protocols. The analysis illustrates that aerobic metabolic metrics can be more repeatable and precise than non-aerobic ones. Consequently, PRAM helps physiologists to better understand whether the observed variability is due to non-repeatable metrics or true individual variation.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

While the symptoms and general etiology may be different, these two diseases share significant common features in terms of their disease pathogenesis. Within the scope of neurodegenerative disorders, the Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) family proteins and associated interactors have been a key area of focus. The BAG family is a group of proteins that contain at least one evolutionarily conserved BAG domain. Despite this similarity, their interactions and functions can vary widely. So far, research has predominantly scrutinized individual BAG proteins, rather than explore potential cooperative actions among family members. Some BAG family members may function together thereby indicating potential interactions within this family. Although connections among BAG members have been observed, their role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD and PD, remains largely uncharacterized. This mini review explores the common pathways, intersections, and differences within these interactions as well as their link to AD and PD. Using computational techniques to mine transcriptomic data, several groupings of pathways that these BAG family members are involved in were identified in the context of AD and PD. Understanding these pathways and their relationships may uncover potential gaps in current research and help identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Although the craspedid versus loricate morphological separation is currently supported by their phylogenetic relationship, recent evidence has suggested inconsistencies between morphology and phylogeny within each group. Loricate choanoflagellate taxonomy has historically been based on selected aspects of their lorica morphology, and on their mode of cell division, in which tectiform daughter cells emerge into a lorica synthesized by their mother cell following division, and nudiform daughter cells do not. Here, we characterize two new loricate strains that display unexpected morphological features when compared to their nearest genetic relatives. The strain BEAP0094 very closely matched the 18S ribosomal gene of the tectiform Pseudostephanoeca paucicostata, but its morphology clearly differed, due to the absence of the characteristic anterior ring found in all Stephanoeca species. Instead, its features resembled more closely those of the Acanthocorbis genus, raising the possibility of the existence of either multiple lorica morphologies within the same or very closely related species, or multiple morphological species sharing the same 18S ribosomal gene. The second strain we investigated, BEAP0360, presented a morphological match to Stephanoeca cauliculata, but its 18S ribosomal sequence did not, suggesting that different species could share the same lorica architecture. BEAP0360, here described as Cepoeca plumata (n. gen. n. sp.), possesses a key phylogenetic placement, potentially as the earliest branching member within nudiform loricates, which would be informative for investigating the evolution of the nudiform lifestyle.

While ET-AP successfully recovered receptor complex components (e.g., TOO MANY MOUTHS), TbID-PL effectively captured transient associations with the components of endosomal trafficking, i.e. clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) machinery. We further identify that specific subfamily members of phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly proteins (PICALMs) interact with and synergistically regulate ERECTA internalization. Mutations of these PICALMs impair ERECTA endocytosis and lead to excessive stomatal clustering. Taken together, our work provides a proteomic atlas of the ERECTA signaling network and suggests that timely removal of receptor kinase by the endocytosis machinery is essential for active signal transduction enforcing stomatal patterning.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to target the functional kinase subunits in rice, we carried out a comprehensive phenotypic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic analyses of rice snrk1 mutants displaying growth defects under normal and starvation conditions. These analyses revealed the role of SnRK1 signaling in controlling growth and stress-related processes in both energy-sufficient and energy-limited conditions and pointed to sub-functionalization of SnRK1 kinase subunit genes. In addition to the classical protein targets of SnRK1, phosphoproteomics revealed novel targets including the key components of intracellular membrane trafficking, ethylene signaling, and ion transport. The upregulation of stress-related processes and suppression of growth-related processes in snrk1 mutants correlated with their phenotypic defects.

Similarly, visual working memory (WM) representations can reflect different priority states. However, it remains unknown whether the priority status of WM-guided novel actions similarly modulates their neural coding format, and how such dynamics unfold over time. We addressed these questions using EEG while human participants performed two consecutive choice reaction tasks. At the start of each trial, participants encoded two novel stimulus-response (S-R) mappings. A cue then indicated whether these mappings would be relevant immediately (\"current\" condition), later after an intervening task (\"prospective\"), or after a free delay (\"delayed\"). Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that the S-R category was decodable in all conditions during relevant time windows. Critically, pattern similarity analyses revealed that while mere maintenance demands allow for temporary preservation of neural codes (i.e., between current and delayed trials), shielding from interference (i.e., prospective trials) induced significant alterations to the neural code. Further exploration of the representational geometry revealed that priority status gained prominence dynamically over S-R category coding when preparing for such shielding demands. Importantly, some of these changes emerged anticipatorily, prior to target onset. Overall, our results show that, similar to visual WM, the priority of intended actions dynamically and anticipatorily reshapes their neural format. They further reveal how different demands induce content geometries compatible with previously proposed coding schemes, and that such representational changes can be implemented flexibly in time.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Litter bags were deployed in a reciprocal transplant design whereby control and treated litter was incubated in control and treated plots. We measured litter mass loss, quality and stoichiometry, moisture content, and microbial and animal community composition.

For regenerating native seedlings, the presence of invasives in the neighbourhood can alter insect herbivory patterns, ultimately shaping restoration trajectories; however, such indirect effects are rarely examined. Here, we investigated the effect of robusta coffee (Coffea canephora) - a shade-tolerant invasive species under closed-canopy secondary forests in the Western Ghats - on the incidence of herbivory (proportion of leaves with any sign of damage) and the extent of leaf damage (percentage leaf area consumed) in seedlings of 10 rainforest species in plots from which coffee plants were either weeded out or left intact. We further examined whether local neighbourhood densities of coffee and other saplings, and species' leaf traits, explained herbivory patterns. Removal of invasive coffee did not influence herbivory incidence or the extent of damage across our focal species. However, the incidence of herbivory declined with increasing neighbourhood plant density, suggesting that neighbourhood plants provide a resource dilution effect. Both incidence and extent of herbivore damage were strongly species-specific and partly explained by leaf traits: greater leaf carbon content was correlated with lower herbivory incidence. Contrary to expectations, plants with resource-acquisitive traits (high leaf nitrogen and specific leaf area) experienced lower incidence of herbivory and extent of damage. Our findings suggest that in this system, the indirect effects via herbivores are perhaps not as important in influencing restoration as the more direct effects of invasive species, such as competition for resources.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Here we present chromosome-scale genome assemblies for 26 Avena taxa, spanning diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid lineages. We traced four independent polyploidization events across the genus, including the formation of A. agadiriana as an allotetraploid (AgAgAg'Ag'), and revealed a reticulate evolutionary history shaped by gene flow involving four subgenomes (A, B, C, D), for example, the hybrid speciation of A. hirtula. Transcriptomic analysis of 286 samples across 11 tissues, combined with deleterious mutation analysis from a cultivated population of 112 accessions, showed that polyploidization led to widespread functional redundancy among homoeologs, supporting a genome-wide buffering effect. However, derived allele frequency analysis revealed that, while disrupting functional genes may yield desirable traits, the buffering effect impedes the fixation of beneficial loss-of-function mutations and thereby limits breeding efficiency. Based on these integrative analyses, we propose breeding strategies to circumvent these limitations by targeting beneficial loss-of-function alleles within the complex polyploid background of oat.

ET neurons are generated from two fundamentally distinct neurogenic pathways: direct neurogenesis (dNG-ETd) from radial glia progenitors and indirect neurogenesis (iNG-ETi) from intermediate progenitors, but the contribution of ETd and ETi to the organization of cortical output channels is unknown. Leveraging a novel lineage-based genetic strategy enabling differential viral access to ETd and ETi in the same mouse, we show that iNG-ETi massively amplifies and diversifies dNG-ETd across the cortex. While ETd projections are largely restricted to the forebrain and midbrain structures, ETi greatly amplifies and diversifies these projections and overwhelmingly dominates the innervation of hindbrain and spinal cord. This is exemplified in an area-specific pattern by ETi dominance to brainstem and spinal action diversification and execution centers from motor areas, to major sensory processing stations along lemniscal pathways from sensory areas, and to pallial, hypothalamic and neuromodulatory structures from high order areas. Corticofugal subpopulations in multiple areas are derived from only ETi, indicating the generation of novel projection types by iNG over dNG. Furthermore, area-specific ETi, but not ETd, spinal projection pattern is sculpted from the massive pruning of an early cortex-wide population during postnatal development.

D-NPs with D-glutathione surface ligands activate D-glutathione receptors on epithelial cells, facilitating their transport into the brain. When illuminated with 980 nm light, the nanoparticle-protein complex stimulates axon regeneration through localized IGF-1 production. This approach successfully regenerated (a) hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer's disease mice and (b) dorsal root ganglion neurons in spinal cord-injured mice. The nanoparticles were thoroughly tested for safety and excreted intact. The local, rather than systemic, IGF-1 up-regulation minimizes its side effects.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Expanding on work linking public TRBV-CDR3 sequences to HLA genotypes, we incorporated \"quasi-public\" metaclonotypes -- composed of rarer TCR{beta} sequences with shared amino acid features -- enriched by HLA genotypes. Using four TCR{beta}seq datasets from 3,150 individuals, we applied TRBV gene partitioning and locality-sensitive hashing to identify ~96,000 TCR{beta} features strongly associated with specific HLA alleles from 71M input TCRs. Binary HLA classifiers built with these features achieved high balanced accuracy (>0.9) across common HLA-A (9/12), B (9/12), C (6/13), DRB1 (11/11) alleles and prevalent DPA1/DPB1 (6/10), DQA1/DQB1 (8/17) heterodimers. We also introduced a high-sensitivity calibration to support predictions in samples with as few as 5,000 unique clonotypes. Calibrated predictions with confidence filtering improved reliability. Beyond genotype imputation, TCR2HLA enables the discovery of novel HLA- and exposure-associated TCRs, as shown by the identification of SARS-CoV-2 related TCRs in a large COVID-19 dataset lacking HLA data. TCR2HLA provides a scalable framework for bridging the gap between TCRseq data and HLA genotype for biomarker discovery.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

N.; Dreyfuss, J.; Hui, P.; Nartey, S.; Yamamoto, H.; Chen, P.-L.; Gao, X.; Doncel, G. F.; Barbieri, R.", "abstract": "Background: Physiological changes during pregnancy result in altered maternal drug metabolism that impacts efficacy and safety of therapeutics in pregnant women. Pregnancy induced hormonal, immunologic, or metabolic changes may also influence and alter drug disposition. Despite research efforts focused on pharmacokinetics of medications used in pregnant women in the past decade, knowledge gaps exist in understanding how pregnancy influences drug disposition and placental drug transporters. Moreover, there is a scarcity of research in understanding the safety and effectiveness of therapeutics in lactating women. This study aimed to determine the effect of pregnancy on levels of miRNAs regulating drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET). Methods: We utilized longitudinal serum specimens collected in 3-month intervals from 88 women who became pregnant during follow-up in a large prospective study of hormonal contraception and HIV acquisition in Uganda and Zimbabwe. We used the HTG EdgeSeq platform coupled with Illumina sequencing to obtain the global miRNA transcriptome in paired specimens collected before, during and after pregnancy. To identify differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs that distinguish pregnancy from pre-conception or breastfeeding we used mixed effect model accounting for multiple samples from the pregnancy event and controlling for fixed effects of batch, country, Nugent score category and sexually transmitted infections. To identify hormonally regulated miRNAs independently associated with Box-Cox-transformed levels of progesterone (P4), beta-estradiol (E2), and sex-hormone binding protein (SHBG) we controlled in addition for age, pregnancy and breastfeeding P-values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR). DMET-targeting miRNAs were identified using miRTarBase focusing on interactions verified by 3-prime UTR luciferase reporter assay and overlapped with DE miRNAs with FDR < 0.05. Results: Of 140 DMET-targeting miRNAs among the 2079 miRNAs in the global peripheral blood transcriptome, 41 unique DMET-targeting miRNAs were found to be DE during pregnancy (38 differentiating pregnancy from preconception and 9 differentiating pregnancy from breastfeeding). The 56 DMETs confirmed as targets of the DE miRNAs included 8 members of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter family, all abundantly expressed in the placenta, and 4 members of the cytochrome P450 Phase 1 enzyme family with major role in xenobiotics detoxification. The study also revealed a strong (FDR<0.05), predominantly positive association between specific DMET-targeting miRNAs and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, suggesting a miRNA-mediated downregulation of DMETs as SHBG levels rise during pregnancy. Conclusion: This research provides crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying altered drug disposition in pregnant and lactating women, paving the way for improved therapeutic management and personalized medicine in these populations.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

The composition of the matrix surrounding habitat fragments influences connectivity between them, which affects gene flow across the landscape. This can further impact populations in various ways. The Shola Sky Island landscapes naturally comprise a biphasic, forest-grassland mosaic ecosystem unique to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats of India. Earlier, this mosaic consisted of patches of native cloud forests embedded in a large grassland matrix. Over the last few decades, however, extensive invasion (up to 60%) of timber species into native grasslands has inverted this mosaic, i.e., small patches of grasslands are nested in a woodland matrix. We attempt to study the effects of these modifications on functional habitat connectivity in this region by modelling species movement using a circuit theory-based algorithm. We do this for seven Shola endemic, range-restricted bird species; six forest-specialist and one grassland-specialist species, based on a decade of field data. We consider a range of species-environment relationships and dispersal capacities for a past, relatively uninvaded landscape and a present, highly modified landscape. We used bird occupancy data (presence/absence from a total of 720 grid cells from targeted occupancy surveys for forest species and 744 presence locations for grassland species from occupancy surveys combined with opportunistic records) along with remotely sensed landscape, vegetation, climatic and topographic variables. We find that connectivity has increased overall for forest specialists, but has reduced for the grassland species. This pattern is concordant with regions where woodland cover from invasive timber species has expanded over approximately two decades. We also identify species-specific areas of low and high connectivity, which may have implications for gene flow within the landscape. This would help focus conservation efforts and predict how future landscape change might affect species persistence.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Existing deep learning-based molecular generative models often treat this task as distribution modeling, relying on atom-level autoregressive actions with less consideration of explicit optimization feedback. Consequently, they frequently generate invalid structures, converge to local optima, or produce synthetically infeasible candidates. Here, we introduce SHARP (Synthesizable Hierarchical Action-space Reinforcement learning for Pareto optimization), a molecular generator that addresses these limitations via a fragment-based hierarchical action space and reinforcement learning. SHARP ensures synthetic accessibility by applying action masks guided by a pretrained Synthesizability Estimation Model (SEM). The reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained using a composite reward function integrating docking scores, pharmacophore matching, and solvent accessibility to generate functionally relevant and experimentally tractable molecules. Furthermore, across four lead optimization tasks, fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and sidechain decoration on a diverse receptor set, SHARP consistently outperforms prior methods in producing molecules at high affinity and synthesizability. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning with a chemically intuitive action space design can be an effective solution to the optimization challenges in AI-driven drug discovery, offering a robust framework for rational molecular design in structure-based applications.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

M.; Jiao, F.; Huang, L.; Zhang, B.", "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central to virtually all biological processes, and their disruption can lead to a wide spectrum of human diseases. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) enables proteome-scale detection of interacting peptide pairs, from which PPIs can be inferred. However, interpretating XL-MS data to assign homologous cross-linked peptide pairs to specific protein interactions can be challenging. A major hurdle arises when a single peptide can map to multiple proteins, and when two such peptides are paired, the number of possible protein-protein interactions increases combinatorially. This mapping ambiguity can lead to inflated interaction networks that could compromise downstream analysis and biological interpretation. However, this problem has often been overlooked or addressed using heuristic approaches in previous XL-MS studies. To tackle this challenge, we developed XL-Ranker, a computational framework that combines a set cover graph algorithm and machine learning to systematically resolve peptide-mapping ambiguity and infer high-confidence PPIs from XL-MS data. Applied to an XL-MS dataset from HEK293 cells, XL-Ranker identified a high-confidence network with 880 PPIs involving 964 unique genes. Among all possible PPIs, the ones selected by XL-Ranker for inclusion in the final network had significantly higher interaction scores in the STRING database than the excluded ones. Network analysis further demonstrated that these interactions form biologically meaningful clusters, supporting the accuracy of our approach. In summary, XL-Ranker provides a practical solution to a key analytical challenge in XL-MS data interpretation, enhancing the reliability of PPI discovery.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

PAH dysfunction leads to the accumulation of L-Phe in the blood (hyperphenylalaninemia; HPA), which may reach neurotoxic levels, resulting in phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is associated with pathogenic variants in PAH, most causing misfolding and instability, leading to decreased levels of PAH protein and activity. Recently, variants in the class C J-domain protein DNAJC12 have also been associated with HPA in patients, demonstrating the importance of protein homeostasis regulation for proper PAH function. DNAJC12 and PAH have previously been reported to interact, but the molecular and structural mechanisms behind complex formation have remained unclear. In this work, we show that DNAJC12 binds to PAH, but presents higher affinity for its L-Phe activated form, which resembles the conformation of unliganded tyrosine hydroxylase, a structurally and functionally-related enzyme that also binds to DNAJC12. At saturation, four monomers of DNAJC12 bind and stabilize the PAH tetramer, protecting it from aggregation and lowering the L-Phe concentration necessary for substrate-induced activation, without affecting the interaction of the enzyme with its cofactor BH4. Importantly, DNAJC12 also stabilizes and delays the aggregation of the PKU-associated variant PAH-p.R261Q.

Light sheet illumination enhances SMLM through optical sectioning of the sample, which drastically improves the signal-to-background ratio and reduces photobleaching and photodamage. Lattice light sheet (LLS) microscopy, in which a 2D optical lattice is implemented for light sheet illumination, can provide exceptional sectioning and extended imaging depth when imaging in scattering samples. However, its conventional dual-objective design poses challenges for certain applications. Here, we present an imaging platform which implements LLS illumination with a reflective single-objective geometry (soLLS) inside a microfluidic chip, enabling the use of a single high numerical aperture objective for both illumination and detection, mitigating constraints of a dual-objective setup. We provide quantitative characterization of the propagation properties of the soLLS and demonstrate that it outperforms conventional Gaussian light sheets in terms of useful field of view and sectioning when propagating through scattering samples. Next, by combining soLLS with point spread function engineering, we demonstrate the platform for improved 3D single-molecule super-resolution imaging of multiple targets across multiple cells.

However, the influence of the TME on the physical characteristics of MSC-derived exosomes remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to investigate the morphological and nanomechanical properties of MSC-derived exosomes under standard and TME-like conditions. AFM imaging in fluid mode preserved the native structure of exosomes and enabled high-resolution analysis of their topography, surface roughness, stiffness, adhesion, and deformation. AFM offers unique advantages in exosome research by enabling label-free, nanoscale analysis of vesicle properties in near-physiological conditions. The ability to detect such subtle but functionally significant changes highlights the relevance of AFM in exosome characterization and quality assessment. Our results revealed that exposure to the TME induces marked changes in exosomal membrane morphology and mechanical behavior, including increased surface heterogeneity, higher stiffness, and altered adhesive interactions. These biophysical alterations may reflect changes in membrane composition and protein or lipid cargo, potentially affecting exosome function, uptake, and therapeutic efficacy.

The increased oxidative state of persisters enabled lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Persisters had an altered lipidome with increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids prone to peroxidation, which was attributable in part to increased lysophosphatidylcholine acyltyransferase 3 (LPCAT3, MBOAT5) expression via loss of ER-mediated repression during endocrine therapy.

In humans, even small, silent strokes can trigger these pathologies, which can spread to brain regions far beyond the infarct and persist chronically, ultimately worsening prognosis and increasing the risk for vascular dementia and Alzheimers disease. The cause of this extensive pathology is unknown, but reactive astrocytes and microglia are likely contributors. Here, we describe an optimized short-duration middle cerebral artery occlusion model that produces a clinically relevant small stroke confined to subcortical regions, similar to most silent strokes in humans. We termed this model the mild subcortical infarct (MSCI). We then mapped the spatiotemporal extent of reactive astrocytes and microglia during the sub-acute period (1, 3, and 7 days) following MSCI. We observed that reactive astrogliosis develops more rapidly and spreads more extensively, permeating the entire middle cerebral artery territory, compared to the reactive microglial response following this small infarct. Microglial depletion resulted in larger infarct sizes but did not prevent the reactive astrocytes, suggesting that ischemia-driven astrogliosis is largely microglia-independent. Lastly, we show that aging mice exposed to MSCI exhibit a comparably strong response of reactive astrocytes and microglia as young mice. We propose that MSCI is a novel and valuable model for examining the subtle yet highly important chronic effects of stroke. It may be especially useful for investigating the influence of reactive astrogliosis on pathologies like neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular dysfunction in regions distal from the primary injury site.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

We identified four consortia with similar taxonomic and functional profiles, but distinctly different distributions within the sedimentary layers. Microbial members common to each of these consortia included novel members of Bathyarchaeia BA1, Desulfatiglandales, Chloroflexota, Caldatribacteriota (JS1), Planctomycetota, and WOR3. The collective metabolic potential of these core consortia contained the capacity to decompose complex carbon and aromatics through syntrophic interactions. The composition and functional potential of these co-occurring members are most similar to communities inhabiting sediment hundreds of meters beneath the surface of deep-sea sediments.

We used experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster to partially separate the gene pools of males and females for 130 generations. In six replicate populations, we forced one pool of genetically variable Chromosome 2s to experience patrilinear inheritance (segregating like a Y-chromosome) and male-limited selection. The alternative pool segregated like an X-chromosome and experienced female-biased selection. This allowed alleles which are differentially selected for between the sexes to diverge between these pools, enabling us to gain insight into the type of genes subject to such selection. We find that genes which diverge between these pools have an elevated intersexual genetic correlation(rMF) for expression on average, consistent with the idea that high genetic correlations may hinder sex-specific adaptation under normal inheritance. Diverged genes were also enriched for moderately male-biased genes whereas female-biased genes were underrepresented. At the SNP level, we find an overrepresentation of diverged SNPs involved in splicing or occurring in the 5'UTR and an underrepresentation of missense or synonymous SNPs, suggesting sex differences in selection for isoform usage.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

The history of how a tumor evolved is often represented using a clonal tree: a particular type of rooted tree where vertices represent tumor cell clones and edges represent ancestral relationships between them. In recent years, numerous algorithms have been developed that infer clonal trees from sequencing data. Correspondingly, researchers have also developed distance measures to compare clonal trees. While such distance measures have proven valuable, they are limited in a variety of ways. First off, they usually only utilize one or a few types of specific information when being computed - making it challenging to assess how well they capture other common types of differences between clonal trees. Secondly, their final output is just a single numerical value - meaning that information on what parts of the trees contributed to the distance is not being readily conveyed. In this work, we address both of these issues. We define a set of four classes of tree differences that describe common ways that clonal trees might differ from each other and analyze these classes using three different clonal tree distance measures. We then introduce a visualization tool called VECTr (Visual Encodings for Clonal Trees) that provides an enhanced pairwise comparison of clonal trees using the same three distance measures. In particular, VECTr contains three types of visualizations that allow a user to easily identify what parts of a tree contribute to its distance, including information relevant to when the trees differ in a manner that corresponds to one of our four classes of tree differences. We demonstrate the utility of our visualization tool using a variety of different use cases, including application to both simulated and real clonal trees.

However, the dissociation rates (koff) from SMFS (~10-1 s-1) typically do not align with those from bulk approaches (~10-6 - 10-5 s-1), likely because SMFS measurements are conducted far from equilibrium. Near equilibrium SMFS requires high throughput measurements to obtain large enough statistics, and high stability over long time measurements at ultraslow loading force rates, impractical in most SMFS techniques. Here, we developed in-situ force calibration strategies for acoustic force spectroscopy (AFS) to probe the unbinding forces of SA-b in the near equilibrium regime, from 10 pN/s down to 10-3 pN/s. The resulting koff was in excellent agreement with that from bulk measurements on the very same system.

Here, we show that BRAF inhibitors (BRAFis) drive accumulation of nuclear {beta}-catenin in CAFs by inducing actin-mediated deformation of the nucleus. Exposure to stiff substrates can also lead CAFs to undergo cytoskeletal reorganization and exert forces on the nucleus, allowing {beta}-catenin to enter the nucleus and reprogram its transcriptional activities. Mechanistically, BRAFi accelerates RAS-dependent RAF kinase transactivation by binding to the BRAF and CRAF kinase domains, accelerating BRAF and CRAF homo and heterodimerization and phosphorylation. Subsequently, RAF activation initiates downstream ERK signaling, which simultaneously inactivates GSK-3{beta} and stimulates Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling. Notably, ablating RAS and RAF isoforms as well as pharmacological blockade of ROCK activity effectively suppressed BRAFi-induced nuclear deformation and {beta}-catenin entry in CAFs, further confirming that the ROCK-cytoskeleton axis mediates BRAFi-driven RAF activation and nuclear import of {beta}-catenin for reprogramming. Thus, ROCK-regulated actin polymerization is a master CAF response pathway that can be stimulated by external signals to reprogram the transcriptional activity of CAFs by enhancing nuclear {beta}-catenin transport through a noncanonical mechanical mechanism.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) detected multiple loci for SNF traits but with limited resolution due to polygenic architecture and environmental influences. Independent component analysis (ICA) identified 136 co-expression modules; ten ICs were strongly correlated with SNF phenotypes and enriched in circadian clock components (e.g., GmLHY1a/b), lipid metabolism, or defense signaling pathways. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) linked 1,453, 806, and 178 genes to NFP, NW, and NFE traits, respectively. Among TWAS hits, 185 transcription factors were identified, with 39.0% overlapping selective sweeps, suggesting regulatory evolution under domestication. To further dissect expression regulation, we performed eQTL mapping and detected 4,654 significant eQTLs, including 1,241 local (cis), 2,505 distal (trans), and 908 mixed. By integrating ATAC-seq data from sorted nodule nuclei, we found that eQTLs, particularly local eQTLs, are significantly enriched within open chromatin regions, indicating their regulatory potential.

Floral display size may have opposite effects on fruit and plant-level paternal diversity, because plants with large displays should receive more pollinator visits but also more sequential probes per visit. To investigate the effect of floral display size on the distribution of paternal diversity in Silene dioica, we genotyped and assigned paternity for 1320 seeds sampled in several fruits per plant in control and manipulated females, whose flower number was artificially increased. We estimated within-fruit paternal diversity and sire profile dissimilarity among fruits and compared these metrics between control and manipulated plants. We then studied pollen carryover using controlled pollinator visits and pollen counts. Most fruits were multiply sired, but we found no effect of flower supplementation on within-fruit paternal diversity. Sire profiles were more similar between fruits located on the same than on different females, but sire profile similarity was not higher within manipulated than within control plants. The pollen deposition curve was steep, with an increasing carryover fraction throughout the visitation sequence. Our results suggest that the effect of floral display size on pollinator foraging behaviour is too weak to affect paternal diversity and its distribution in S. dioica, or that other processes, such as limited pollen carryover and spatially restricted pollen dispersal, blur the effect of pollinator visit frequency and movements on sire profiles.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Acute microglial depletion using the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622, has become a popular approach to uncover microglial function.

In characterizing underlying mechanisms, we found that PLX5622 treatment did not change the global neuronal activity during anesthesia, but robustly enhanced anesthetic metabolism. Moreover, PLX5622 dramatically induced the expression of hepatic enzymes that extensively modify xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism. Blocking increased enzymatic activity significantly reduced the arousal-promoting effects of PLX5622 in anesthesia, irrespective of microglial elimination.

Recently, a non-human primate (NHP) model of HD was developed via stereotaxic delivery of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing 85 CAG repeats (85Q) into the striatum. This model recapitulates several neuropathological changes and symptoms observed in people with HD (PwHD) including chorea and mild cognitive impairment. A previous longitudinal, multimodal MRI investigation in this model revealed volumetric and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) changes compared to controls, in key regions involved in HD, over the course of 30 months. We aimed to study longitudinal changes in structural connectivity (SC), obtained from diffusion MRI scans from the same animals, comparing the 85Q animals to the control (Buffer) group. Additionally, going beyond the correlative rs-FC analyses, we investigated changes in causal, inter-regional functional interactions by estimating effective connectivity (EC) from rs functional MRI scans, constrained to strong structural connections. We found that the SC between basal ganglia regions and the cortex was reduced in the 85Q primates compared to the Buffer group at 14-months post virus injection, aligning with the pathological process observed in PwHD at later stages of the disease. EC from the caudate and putamen to the motor cortex was significantly reduced in the 85Q animals as early as 3-months post-injection providing novel insights into early alterations in causal functional interactions.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Such a function would predict that errors in perceived limb position and velocity should be correlated, but this prediction remains empirically underexplored. We hypothesized that an online evaluation of the integral of sensed velocity influences the perceived arm position during active movements. Such a mechanism would explain how vibratory stimulation of velocity-sensitive Ia afferents leads to the classic pattern of biased movement endpoint accuracy. Using a virtual reality-based reaching task, we investigated how vibration-biased proprioceptive feedback influences voluntary movement control. Our results suggest that muscle vibration biases perceived movement velocity, with downstream effects on perceived limb position and reflexive corrections of movement speed. We found that (i) antagonist vibration during active movement caused participants to both overestimate their movement speed while also slowing down, (ii) movement speed and endpoint errors were correlated, with muscle vibration affecting both, and (iii) adjustments in movement speed to muscle vibration are sufficiently fast to be reflexive.

In two experiments, we presented male and female participants with semantically coherent sentences that ended in words of varying predictability. We also manipulated the signal quality of the final word by applying time-specific degradation. Using linear encoding models of EEG responses, we found that neural representations of speech features were jointly influenced by top-down predictions and bottom-up signal quality. Specifically, for unpredicted final words, increasing signal quality resulted in enhanced neural tracking of spectral and temporal modulations. In contrast, for strongly predicted final words, greater signal quality led to reduced tracking of speech modulations. Computational simulations revealed that this interaction is consistent with prediction error computations, but not with alternative models such as signal sharpening.

Listeners achieve robust speech comprehension by tracking acoustic variability across talkers and implementing predictions based on their prior knowledge and contextual information. However, how perceptual adaptation to speech and predictive processing influence each other is still largely unknown. In this EEG study, we examined how listeners process continuous speech when exposed to a single familiar talker (Single condition) versus multiple unfamiliar talkers (Multi condition), all with native Italian pronunciation. By applying multivariate Temporal Response Function (TRF), we aimed to determine whether increased talker variability in the Multi condition influences phonemic encoding and predictive processing, as indexed by neural responses to cohort entropy (phonological uncertainty among lexical candidates) and semantic surprisal (lexical prediction error). Results showed increased neural responses to phonemic categories and to cohort entropy in the Multi than in the Single condition. These effects suggest that acoustic variability across talkers increases uncertainty in perceiving individual phonemes, prompting the brain to avoid committing to specific lexical candidates during word processing. Importantly, semantic surprisal responses were comparable between conditions, indicating that the modulation primarily affects early stages of processing. This study provided a critical test for how listeners compensate for increased bottom-up uncertainty by implementing probabilistic predictions during language comprehension.

By contrast, many skills are learned without external guidance, posing a challenge to RL's ability to account for self-directed learning. For instance, juvenile male zebra finches first memorize and then train themselves to reproduce the song of an adult male tutor through extensive practice. This process is believed to be guided by an internally computed assessment of performance quality, though the mechanism and development of this signal remain unknown. Here, we propose that, contrary to prevailing assumptions, tutor song memorization and performance assessment are subserved by the same neural circuit, one trained to predictively cancel tutor song. To test this hypothesis, we built models of a local forebrain circuit that learns to use contextual input from premotor regions to cancel tutor song auditory input via plasticity at different synaptic loci. We found that, after learning, excitatory projection neurons in these circuits exhibited population error codes signaling mismatches between the tutor song memory and birds' own performance, and these signals best matched experimental data when networks were trained with anti-Hebbian plasticity in the recurrent pathway through inhibitory interneurons. We also found that model learning proceeds in two stages, with an initial phase of sharpening error sensitivity followed by a fine-tuning period in which error responses to the tutor song are minimized. Finally, we showed that the error signal produced by this model can train a simple RL agent to replicate the spectrograms of adult bird songs.

Here we test the prediction for language use by modeling hierarchy depth and sentence length in Universal Dependencies corpora from 30 languages, and the prediction for language evolution by modeling the phylogenetic dynamics of structural asymmetry in clause combinations of 59 languages from three families. We found no effect of writing in either analysis. Hierarchy depth and sentence length do not demonstrably differ between spoken and written use of language, and the introduction of writing had no discernible effect on the evolution of clause combining in grammar. There is weak evidence for a decrease in variance after the introduction of writing in one family, possibly reflecting the impact of increased normativity.

Here we 1) inferred the ancestral state of a HS in amphibians, 2) analyzed if amphibians with a HS have larger distributional ranges, and 3) explored how a HS may affect amphibian assemblage resilience using multiple models of climate change. We highlight that more research is necessary as information was available for many different lineages but < 10% of the total amphibian species. Ancestral state reconstruction showed a relatively high probability for the presences of a HS in the most recent common ancestors of Anura (73.09 {+/-} 13.73), Caudata (78.66 {+/-} 12.30), and Gymnophiona (77.26 {+/-} 14.74). Our climate analyses predict that tropical zones will have the greatest degree of climate change, despite having the lowest proportion of species with HS. Thus, tropical amphibian assemblages at low elevations or in tropical rainforests may be vulnerable to changes in climate. We found that species with a HS have significantly larger distribution ranges and most of those species are in the Least Concern IUCN category. It is likely that presence of HS as an ancestral state has been key for the evolutionary success in amphibians, and it will likely impact their future survival in the face of climate change.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in sequencing technology increasingly allow generating whole-genome sequencing data, both ancient and modern, which not only enable querying nearly every base of the genome, but also contain numerous rare variants. Rare variants, with their more population-specific distribution, allow detection of population structure with much finer resolution than common variants - an opportunity that has so far been under-exploited. Here, we develop a new statistical method, RAS (Rare Allele Sharing), for summarizing rare allele frequency correlations, similar to F-statistics but with flexible ascertainment on allele frequencies. We test RAS on both published and simulated data and find that RAS has better resolution in distinguishing populations, with appropriate ascertainment. Leveraging this, we further develop the use of RAS to compute ancestry proportions with higher accuracy than existing methods, in cases of closely-related source populations. We implemented the new statistical methods as an R package and a command line tool. In summary, our method can provide new perspectives to identify and model population structure, allowing us to understand more subtle relationships among populations in the recent human past.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we present FLEXTAG (Fluorescent Labeling for Exchangeable, X-resilient Tagging in Advanced Generic Nanoscopy), a comprehensive protein labeling system comprising three orthogonal, ultrasmall (12-18 kDa), and self-renewable protein tags that collectively overcome these major limitations of existing tagging systems, enabling optimized multi-color super-resolution imaging. Through continuous exchange of organic fluorophores, FLEXTAG supports unprecedented durations of high-resolution imaging in both live and fixed cells with minimal photobleaching. It is compatible with major super-resolution modalities, such as SIM, STED, STORM, and PAINT, and is applicable to a wide range of subcellar targets. To further address fixation-induced labeling inefficiency and background fluorescence, we developed a novel protection-based fixation method and chemical blocking strategies that significantly preserve tag accessibility and enhance signal-to-noise ratio, improvements that are broadly applicable to other protein tagging systems.

Across all CVD grown materials, the stem cells exhibited outstanding viability, with no significant differences in metabolic activity or live/apoptotic cell ratios compared to laminin-coated glass controls (p > 0.05). Importantly, these large-area 2D materials robustly supported neuronal differentiation, as evidenced by widespread {beta}III-tubulin expression.

To address this, we developed SimSpace, a flexible simulation framework that can generate synthetic spatial cell maps with categorical cell type labels and biologically meaningful organization. Cell type spatial patterns are simulated using a Markov Random Field model, enabling the control of spatial autocorrelation and interaction between cell types. This approach captures a broad range of tissue architectures, from well-separated niches to spatially mixed environments. We evaluate the simulated data using spatial statistics metrics (eg. entropy, Moran's I) and benchmark the results against real spatial transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. Our findings show that the simulations closely mirror key spatial properties observed in biological tissues.

While the evolutionary pressures driving such extreme sperm (flagellar) lengths have long been investigated, the physical consequences of their gigantism are unstudied. Through high-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of in vivo sperm morphologies and rapid live imaging, we discovered that stored sperm are organized into a dense and highly aligned state. The packed flagella exhibit system-wide collective 'material' flows, with persistent and slow-moving topological defects; individual sperm, despite their extraordinary lengths, propagate rapidly through the flagellar material, moving in either direction along material director lines. To understand how these collective behaviors arise from the constituents' nonequilibrium dynamics, we conceptualize the motion of individual sperm as topologically confined to a reptation-like tube formed by its neighbors. Therein, sperm propagate through observed amplitude-constrained and internally driven flagellar bending waves, pushing off counter-propagating neighbors. From this conception, we derive a continuum theory that produces an extensile material stress that can sustain an aligned flagellar material. Experimental perturbations and simulations of active elastic filaments verify our theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest that active stresses in the flagellar material maintain the sperm in an unentangled, hence functional state, in both sexes, and establish giant sperm in their native habitat as a novel and physiologically relevant active matter system.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms linking these functional regions remain poorly understood. Here, we present the 2.04 [A] crystal structure of unliganded HsTom70c, revealing two distinct conformations, open and closed, within the asymmetric unit. These states are stabilized in part by interdomain crystal contacts and are supported in solution by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Principal component and dynamical network analyses reveal a continuum of motion linking the NTD and CTD via key structural elements, notably residues in helices 7, 8, and 25. Engagement of the CTD by the viral protein Orf9b interrupts this network, stabilizing a partially-closed intermediate conformation and dampening dynamics at distal NTD sites.

MicroRNAs are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and are attractive targets for HCC therapy. Here we sought to identify and characterize dysregulated microRNAs in MASH-driven HCC (MASH-HCC). Approach and Results We profiled microRNA expression in liver tissue from patients with MASH and/or MASH-HCC and in zebrafish HCC driven by activated {beta}-catenin (ABC), one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in MASH-HCC. We found significant overlap between dysregulated human and zebrafish miRNAs, including miR-21, which was increasingly upregulated from normal liver to MASH to MASH-HCC. We generated transgenic zebrafish that overexpress or sponge (downregulate) miR-21. We found that miR-21 overexpression caused larval liver overgrowth and increased HCC while miR-21 sponge suppressed {beta}-catenin-driven larval liver overgrowth. By performing histologic and lipidomic analysis, we found that overexpression of miR-21, like ABC, suppressed lipid accumulation in response to a high cholesterol diet and increased accumulation of acylcarnitines. Conclusions Here we characterize microRNA dysregulation in MASH and MASH-HCC in patients, identify miR-21 as increasingly dysregulated from MASH to MASH-HCC, and delineate the impacts of miR-21 overexpression on lipid metabolism and hepatocarcinogenesis in zebrafish {beta}-catenin-driven HCC.

We aimed to determine whether primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVECs) from individuals with T2D exhibit abnormal cellular functions, and whether exposure to T2D serum impacts healthy endothelial function. In Experiment 1, T2D-HDMVECs displayed paradoxically higher migratory and angiogenic capacities than their healthy counterparts, despite markedly reduced eNOS expression and disrupted endothelial-identity gene expression. In Experiments 2 and 3, healthy HDMVECs showed decreased tube formation, nitric oxide production, and Notch/angiogenesis-related gene expression after exposure to both healthy and T2D serum, suggesting the presence of serum-derived factors that inhibit these pathways. However, T2D-HDMVECs remained largely unresponsive to these serum-driven effects, reinforcing an intrinsic reprogramming of T2D endothelial cells. Overall, our data reveal a complex interplay between cell-autonomous alterations and extrinsic signals in diabetic endothelial dysfunction. Therapeutic strategies targeting both intrinsic cellular programs (e.g., eNOS, Notch signaling) and the circulating milieu may represent promising avenues for enhancing wound repair in patients with T2D.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

In addition, injury to myelin prompts a regenerative response that leads to the formation of new myelin sheaths. However, the signals regulating effective remyelination by oligodendrocytes are still not completely understood. Here, we report that oligodendrocytes can internalize exogenous myelin both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to an increase in their proliferation and differentiation when their functions are not compromised. RNA sequencing reveals that myelin debris alters oligodendrocyte transcriptional profile, suppressing immune-related pathways and de novo cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, while inducing lipid droplet formation to store and process internalized myelin particles. As a result, progression of the oligodendroglial lineage is enhanced in primary cell cultures, as shown by increased viability, proliferation and differentiation. Oligodendrocytes also acquire a more differentiated phenotype, with larger cell areas, a more complex morphology and myelination of synthetic nanofibers. Stereotaxic injection of fluorescent myelin into mouse cortex shows internalization by microglia and, to a lesser extent, by oligodendroglia. Notably, in the zebrafish model, ventricular injections of myelin also increase the number of ventral oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord, further supporting that myelin can promote lineage progression. These findings challenge the classical view that myelin debris intrinsically inhibits oligodendrocyte proliferation, suggesting instead that oligodendrocytes can use myelin to support self-renewal and maturation, acting as a trophic factor in the absence of pathological cues.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

C. S.; Wessel, J. R.", "abstract": "Goal-directed behavior relies on cognitive flexibility - the ability to rapidly adapt ongoing thoughts and behaviors while preserving task-relevant information. The performance monitoring system optimizes such behavior by detecting and evaluating errors, while the working memory (WM) system maintains relevant information and protects it from interference. We investigated how these two systems interact. In prior work (Wessel et al., 2022), we found that motor errors impaired active WM maintenance (Error-Related Impairment of Active working Memory; ERIAM). Here, we aimed to identify the source of ERIAM by tracking a neurophysiological marker of visual WM maintenance - the contralateral delay activity (CDA) - throughout the error-making process. Forty-two human participants maintained visual information in WM while performing a motoric task during the delay period. Consistent with prior results, a significant ERIAM effect occurred: motor errors impaired WM performance. Critically, CDA amplitudes did not differ between motor correct and error trials before the flanker task, ruling out a general performance deficit. The CDA was also unaffected immediately after flankers, ruling out a perceptual interference explanation. Significant CDA differences only emerged after motor errors, supporting a genuinely error-related origin of the ERIAM effect. Contrary to prediction, however, CDA was more disrupted after correct responses than errors, and greater disruptions predicted a smaller ERIAM effect. These findings suggest that participants might store WM in multiple states to reduce interference from errors and that the CDA dynamics reflect these adaptive shielding strategies. These findings provide new insights into the source of error-related interference in active WM.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

The 1.6-A resolution structure of ARC reveals that it adopts a globular fold nearly identical to the human CD38 ADP ribosyl cyclase, with key catalytic residues conserved. ARC toxicity is neutralized in P. ananatis by a dedicated immunity protein. Comparative genomics reveals that CD38-like ARC domains are widespread in bacteria, fused to diverse delivery modules including T6SS, T7SS, and CDI systems. Functional assays demonstrate that these domains act as NAD-depleting toxins, with cross-immunity observed between non-cognate toxin-immunity pairs.

Thermophilic microbes have been discovered in various permanently cold environments, including permafrost, where they can persist for extended periods. The reason for this apparent mismatch between microbial adaptations and environmental conditions is unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that thermophilic traits provide selective advantage to extremely slow-growing microbes, even in cold temperatures. We used a computational approach to predict optimal growth rates and several measures of thermophilicity in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from permafrost and active layer soils in diverse cold regions. We find that in permafrost, where available energy is always low, measures of thermophilicity correlate positively with minimum doubling time, indicating that slow growers in permafrost have more thermophilic traits. This trend is reversed in microbes in active layer soil, in which seasonal thawing, temperature changes, and episodic rain events allow periodic fast growth. Similar trends were observed in the relationship between optimal growth rates and the optimal temperature of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), an enzyme whose temperature optimum is known to be correlated to optimal growth temperatures of the host organism. Thermophilic traits within slow growers appear to be environmentally rather than phylogenetically constrained, and thermophilic slow growers share few horizontal gene transfers with other permafrost microbes.

EHP infection in shrimp results in growth retardation and size variation, leading to severe economic loss to shrimp aquaculture worldwide. Similar to other microsporidian species, EHP utilizes a harpoon-like invasion apparatus called the polar tube in order to infect host cells. The polar tube typically coils inside the spore and rapidly transits to a long, extended tube after being activated with proper stimuli. However, the mechanism and physical conditions affecting the polar tube firing in EHP are poorly understood. Here, we screened several germination buffers and found that a buffer containing potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) at pH 3.0 yielded the highest germination rate. The optimal temperatures for EHP germination range between 25-28{degrees}C, similar to the shrimps body temperature. The spores require at least 30 seconds to be activated, suggesting that the stimuli could rapidly move across the spore wall. We utilized high-speed live-cell imaging to study the dynamics of the EHP polar tube firing and compared the dynamics when the spores were treated with KHP and a previously reported stimulus, phloxine B. The polar tube firing dynamics between these two conditions are different. The total firing time was ~100 milliseconds with the maximum velocity of ~300 m*s-1 in KHP condition. Further investigation on the EHP polar tube ultrastructure using cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the EHP polar tube was composed of a membrane layer with an additional repetitive protein-array on the outermost surface. The distance between each repetitive unit ranges between 52-66 [A]. These repetitive units could possibly be polar tube proteins (PTPs).

Since 2010, yellow fever vaccination is not recommended for breastfeeding women due to reported cases of vaccine strain transmission through breast milk, leading to neonatal meningoencephalitis. However, the efficiency of YFV vaccine strain transmission via breastfeeding remains unknown, and wild-type strains transmission may be suspected based on viral RNA detection in breast milk. Direct evidence of breastfeeding-related transmission in humans is challenging to obtain given the confounding presence of vector-borne transmission, making animal models crucial for evaluating this risk. In this study, the A129 mouse model was used to investigate YFV transmission via breastfeeding for both wild-type and vaccine strains. Results show that both strains can spread to mammary glands, leading to viral detection in breast milk as free viral particles and cell-associated virus, with similar viral loads for all strains. Mammary stromal and immune cells are primary targets of YFV in vivo, while mammary epithelial cells also support infection, suggesting two possible mechanisms of mammary epithelial crossing. Neonates are found to be susceptible to oral infection, with higher infection rates for the wild-type strain but evidence of neuroinvasion for both strains. Both strains can infect and cross an in vitro human intestinal barrier model, indicating this epithelium as a potential viral entry site for neonates. Finally, this study confirms the existence of YFV transmission through breastfeeding in an animal model, highlighting the need to consider it among transmission risks.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Microscopic observation remains a widely used approach to study these phenotypes. However, variation in sample preparation and operators skill can limit the scale of sample processing or introduce bias. Although several image-based cell detection tools have been developed, most are tailored to specific applications or limited to a particular taxon. To address the need for a tool applicable to the polymorphic, yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans, and with potential applicability to other taxa, we developed TU_MyCo-Vision, an Ultralytics YOLO (You Only Look Once) based object detection tool for identifying 13 fungal morphotypes in bright-field microscopic images. The tool integrates a YOLOv11m-based object detector trained on a custom dataset of 1,504 annotated images and a standalone graphical user interface that enables downstream data analysis and visualization of results. The best-performing model (Zulu_s3) achieved a mean precision of 73.4%, a recall of 66.5%, a mean average precision at 50% IoU (mAP@50) of 73.5%, and a mean average precision at varying IoU thresholds between 50 to 90% IoU (mAP@50-95) of 54.5% across all 13 classes. The single-group analysis pipeline was validated on a 90-image test set, generating six quantitative summaries, including absolute counts, relative and mean relative abundance plots, stacked bar plots, and clustered heatmaps. Multi-group evaluation on previously unseen datasets comprising Candida albicans, Komagataella phaffii, and Aspergillus niger spores demonstrated the tool's potential applicability to other genera. TU_MyCo-Vision is distributed as a fully packaged, cross-platform executable, eliminating the need for environment setup or manual installation of dependencies. Built entirely on open-source frameworks, it provides a foundational and potentially extensible solution for automated fungal morphology detection and analysis.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

However, these methods are not suitable for large-scale studies due to their low-throughput and cost. To overcome these limitations, we established a simultaneous measurement system for multiple samples (144 samples) for measuring d-ROMs and BAP using a pipetting robot and a 384-well plate. The developed system demonstrated good linearity and reproducibility, while significantly reducing reagent and sample consumption. Measurement differences compared to the one of the currently available FREE Carrio Duo system ranged from -5% to 3% for d-ROMs and -12% to 8% for BAP, indicating high consistency with existing methods. Furthermore, the measurement time was substantially shortened from 24 hours (10 minutes x 144 samples) to at longest four hours, although the final color measurements for d-ROMs were performed one week later.

While nucleotide sequence and DNA shape are known determinants of TF binding, the role of DNA flexibility encompassing axial, torsional, and stretching dynamics remains largely unexplored, particularly across diverse TF families. Here, we systematically integrate experimentally and computationally derived DNA flexibility descriptors into predictive models of TF-DNA binding specificity. Through extensive analyses of large-scale in vitro datasets from HT-SELEX, SELEX-Seq, protein binding microarrays encompassing mammalian and Drosophila TFs, we demonstrate that flexibility-augmented models consistently outperform sequence based models, and DNA shape augmented models to an extent. These improvements are robust across diverse experimental platforms and scale of the datasets, underscoring the importance of DNA conformational dynamics in indirect readout. Quantitative analyses of position-specific flexibility contributions reveal distinct \"flexibility hotspots\" within transcription factor binding sites and their flanking regions. This is exemplified by structural insights into the homeodomain TF MSX1, where localized DNA bendability directly correlates with enhanced binding a[ff]inity and precise recognition specificity. Finally, leveraging in vivo ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq data from ENCODE, we further validate that DNA flexibility substantially enhances the identification of functional TF binding sites across various TF families and cellular contexts.

While classical NLSs have been extensively characterized in plants, the functionality of non-classical PYNLS (proline-tyrosine NLS) motifs - previously described only in animals and fungi - remains unexplored. Here, we present the first systematic characterization of PYNLS motifs in plants, demonstrating their functionality and divergence from known eukaryotic models. Using transient expression in tobacco and stable Arabidopsis lines, we show that PYNLS motifs from the jasmonate signaling protein JAZ1 and a previously uncharacterized PLA2-like protein mediate Karyopherin {beta}2 (Kap{beta}2)-dependent nuclear import. Through site-directed mutagenesis, structural modeling, and interaction assays, we define key sequence and structural determinants of functional PYNLS activity, including an extended linker between binding epitopes and a short -helix upstream of the conserved PY dipeptide. These features distinguish plant PYNLS motifs from their counterparts in animals and fungi. Leveraging these criteria, we identified 125 Arabidopsis proteins with predicted functional PYNLSs, encompassing transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and components involved in calcium signaling. Notably, Kap{beta}2 interaction also modulated condensate formation by cytoplasmic JAZ1, indicating a dual role for Kap{beta}2 in nuclear import and phase separation.

While TNF-a-induced CAM expression mediates leukocyte interaction, the role of a potential inflammatory morphological phenotype (IMP) - characterised by barrier-function decrease and shape-change in TEM - remains unclear. This study identifies the TNF-a-induced IMP as indispensable for neutrophil TEM, while regulating barrier-function. The TNF-a-induced IMP progresses through two states: an intermediate state that transiently enhances barrier function via MLC-dephosphorylation, junctional actin recruitment and VE-cadherin linearisation, protecting the monolayer from collapse; while the subsequent development of the IMP requires MLC rephosphorylation, junctional actin disassembly, stress fibre formation and Arp2/3-mediated membrane protrusions causing shape-change. This in turn dilutes junctional VE-cadherin, forming intercellular gaps for neutrophil TEM, while inducing junction-associated intermittent lamellipodia (JAIL) to locally restore VE-cadherin adhesion, appearing as gap/JAIL cycles driving junctional dynamics. VE-cadherin overexpression blocks TNF-a-induced IMP and gap/JAIL cycling, reducing TEM by ~80% without altering CAM expression.

In this study, we screened all complete bacterial genomes in the NCBI RefSeq database for homologs of 43 candidate defluorinating enzymes, focusing on their genetic context and association with mobile genetic elements. Our analysis revealed that fluoroacetate dehalogenases and haloacid dehalogenases are among the most frequently mobilized enzyme classes, suggesting positive selection. Notably, a conserved gene encoding a fluoroacetate dehalogenase homolog in Microcystis cyanobacteria is consistently flanked by genes related to stress response, photosynthesis, and toxin-antitoxin systems, suggesting a potential adaption to alleviate PFAS toxicity.

A.; Camilli, A.; Waters, C. M.; Ng, W.-L.", "abstract": "A family of prokaryotic antiviral systems collectively known as the cyclic oligonucleotide-based signaling system (CBASS) is found in many bacterial species. Phage defense in CBASS is mediated by the action of a specific effector activated by the cognate cyclic oligonucleotide, often resulting in abortive infection. In the prototypical Type II-A CBASS, phage defense is initiated by the production of cyclic GMPAMP (cGAMP) by enzymes known as cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases (CD-NTases) within the bacterial host, and subsequent activation of the CapV phospholipase by cGAMP leads to cell lysis, thereby limiting phage replication within the host population. Phage proteins that degrade cGAMP, sequester cGAMP, or prevent cGAMP synthesis have been identified in phages to evade CBASS protection. However, some phages are resistant to CBASS protection despite not encoding these proteins, suggesting that additional counter-defense mechanisms exist. To identify new anti-CBASS mechanisms in phages, we exploited bacterial host sensitivity to the antimicrobial compound sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as an indirect read-out for CBASS activity. Bacteria with active CBASS are more sensitive to SMX; therefore, we postulated that any viral proteins produced inside the bacterial host that target CBASS could increase bacterial SMX resistance. Using this screen, we identified that the Gp15 protein from the vibriophage ICP3 increases SMX resistance in Vibrio cholerae El Tor biotype that encodes an active CBASS. Gp15 is an essential virion protein involved in DNA ejection and conserved in many phages. Expression of Gp15 of another coliphage increases SMX resistance in Escherichia coli expressing an active CBASS, and it allows CBASS-sensitive phage to infect the bacterial host with CBASS, demonstrating an important role of Gp15 in phage defense evasion. Unlike other known anti-CBASS proteins, Gp15 does not degrade or sequester cGAMP, and it does not reduce the cellular level of cGAMP. Gp15 also does not interfere with CapV binding to cGAMP. Instead, Gp15 directly inhibits cGAMP-activated CapV serine hydrolase activity in a stoichiometric manner. Together, our study reveals a new mechanism for CBASS antagonism, in which a phage DNA ejection protein moonlights to inhibit a CBASS effector, thereby evading anti-phage defense.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a novel flow cytometry-based method that enables the quantitative assessment of infection of hepatic cells by non-fluorescent Plasmodium parasites.

In nature, microbes exist in syntrophic consortia, allowing for mutually-beneficial interactions, the production of novel products and the realization of novel benefits - including better carbon conservation - not seen in monocultures. Here, for increased acetone production, we transformed Clostridium acetobutylicum with a plasmid (p95ace02a) expressing a synthetic acetone pathway made up of four native genes. This engineered C. acetobutylicum was cocultured with Clostridium ljungdahlii to capture the waste CO2 and H2 generated due to glucose catabolism by C. acetobutylicum, and to convert acetone into isopropanol. We examined the impact of starting cell densities, the gas atmosphere (N2, H2, or H2/CO2) and coculture species ratios (using a recently developed RNA-FISH flow cytometric assay) on metabolite production, yields and sugar-carbon utilization. Metabolic flux analysis identified the complex patterns by which the two species alter the metabolism of each other in a cell-density and gas-atmosphere dependent manner. For example, C. ljungdahlii activated the dormant acetate uptake in C. acetobutylicum, while coculture density dramatically impacted species ratios, electron management, and the H2 utilization of C. ljungdahlii.

However, the large extent of bat viruses remains unexplored, especially in highly biodiverse regions of the Neotropics such as Brazil. We used a meta-transcriptomic to characterize new virus genomes found in blood, oral and anal samples collected from cave- and non-cave bats from Northeast Brazil. From a total of 19 coronavirus-positive bats, we have assembled two complete genomes of a new Betacoronavirus subgenus, named Ambecovirus (American betacoronavirus). The subgenus herein described is phylogenetically placed between the Sarbeco-/Hibeco-/Nebecovirus and the Merbeco-/Embecovirus clades, being basal to the former. While the conserved S2 region of the spike protein retained hallmark domains, including HR1 and HR2, the S1/S2 cleavage site and the furin cleavage site, the S1 region consistently displayed only the N-terminal domain. The receptor-binding domain could not be identified due to high dissimilarity relative to known congeneres. The detection of Ambercovirus in sympatric Pteronotus gymnonotus and Carollia perspicillata bats suggests interspecies transmission.

This is due to concerns that dental age inaccuracies, especially in older animals, may affect epigenetic clock performance. To explore this, we developed the first species-specific epigenetic clock for common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), analysing DNA methylation at 37,492 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites in skin samples from stranded and bycaught dolphins with estimated dental ages. Elastic net models with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation were applied to three subsets: the relaxed subset (all individuals; n = 75, MAE = 1.94, r = 0.82, R2 = 0.64), the strict subset (excluding individuals with minimum dental age estimates only; n = 70, MAE = 1.91, r = 0.85, R2 = 0.68), and the restricted subset (excluding outliers with prediction errors > 6 years; n = 64, MAE = 1.75, r = 0.91, R2 = 0.80) to compare performance. Our models consistently underestimated the age of dolphins >16 years, even when minimum dental ages were applied, suggesting discrepancies between dental and epigenetic estimates unlikely reflect dental aging error.

We found a general trend of reduced genomic diversity and increased inbreeding from north to south across six sites in New South Wales. A genome-wide association study of 153 individuals from sites with known Chlamydia pecorum presence were used to investigate the potential relationship between inbreeding and infection. Chlamydia positive individuals (average FH = 0.026) were significantly more inbred than Chlamydia negative individuals (average FH= -0.0051) (t = -2.31, df = 151, p-value = 0.022).

Interestingly, populations considered putatively Chlamydia-free had similar allele frequencies across candidate loci as Chlamydia positive individuals. Combined with gene flow analyses, this result suggests that isolation may have protected these populations more than harbouring alleles conferring infection resilience and supports the concept that disease should be carefully considered in any conservation measures that increase connectivity or translocations. Our genome-wide approach has identified several avenues for investigations into the pathogenesis of Chlamydia infection and chlamydiosis.

The molecular basis of these interactions remains poorly understood. Using fluorescence anisotropy, we show that full-length human PDZK1 binds the C terminal peptide of URAT1 with high affinity (KD 170 nM), unlike NHERF1 (KD >70 M). The PDZ1 domain of PDZK1 alone is sufficient for high-affinity binding (KD 160 nM), while PDZ4 provides a secondary site (KD 1.35 M), with both interactions characterized by rapid kinetics. Gel filtration shows that PDZK1 can bind two URAT1 peptides. X-ray structures of individual PDZ domains from PDZK1 and NHERF1 complexed with the URAT1 peptide reveal the molecular determinants of the higher affinity and selectivity for PDZK1. Murine Pdzk1 and Nherf1 bind Urat1 with high affinity indicating species-specific interactions. These data provide insights into URAT1 regulation by PDZ scaffold proteins with relevance for understanding urate homeostasis regulation and related disorders.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

R.; Kim, S.; Jin, G.-w.; Choy, J.-H.", "abstract": "Traditional cancer therapies have primarily focused on directly targeting malignant cells, yet this paradigm has consistently fallen short in addressing therapeutic resistance and metastasis. These persistent challenges suggest that the tumor's surrounding environment, not just the cancer cells themselves, plays a decisive role in treatment failure. In this study, we present an ecosystem-oriented strategy that targets the pathological microenvironment sustaining cancer progression. We repurposed niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelmintic agent, and enhanced its bioavailability by formulating Penetrium, an orally deliverable nanotherapeutic composed of niclosamide, magnesium oxide, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. In syngeneic and xenograft models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Penetrium showed robust antitumor synergy when combined with standard therapies, including anti-PD-1, paclitaxel, and anti-VEGF agents. Notably, Penetrium markedly blocked metastatic spread. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Penetrium remodels the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM), downregulates MMP-9, restores E-cadherin, and enhances immune infiltration, thereby converting immune-excluded tumors into immune-permissive niches. Furthermore, in patient-derived pancreatic tumor organoids co-cultured with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), we demonstrated that tumor cell survival is critically dependent on the stromal context. Importantly, Penetrium selectively eliminated CAFs without affecting normal fibroblasts. These findings validate the oncogenic biosphere, and especially the CAF-rich stroma, as a critical therapeutic target. Our results underscore a shift from the conventional cancer cell-centric model to an oncogenic biosphere-disruption strategy that dismantles the structural and immunological defenses of desmoplastic cancers, offering a promising avenue for overcoming resistance and metastasis.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to investigate the differential response characteristics and underlying physiological and ecological mechanisms of alfalfa during the germination stage under drought stress, bicarbonate stress, and their combined effects. Twelve alfalfa varieties were subjected to germination tests using PEG-6000 to simulate drought stress (0~20%) and NaHCO to simulate bicarbonate stress (0~30 mM). Based on the semi-inhibitory concentrations and phenotypic indices observed under single-stress conditions, a combined stress treatment was designed. The subordinate function method was employed to comprehensively evaluate the variations in stress responses among the twelve alfalfa varieties during the germination stage. Additionally, this study explored the physiological and ecological response mechanisms of drought-tolerant, salt-tolerant, and drought-salt-sensitive varieties. Among the 12 alfalfa varieties, WL363HQ has the strongest drought and salt tolerance, while WL319HQ is the most sensitive to drought and salt stress. Based on this, the varieties can be classified into drought-tolerant, salt-tolerant, and sensitive categories. At low concentrations, the drought-salt combination shows antagonism (salt alleviates drought inhibition); at high concentrations, it turns into synergy, and the inhibitory effect is amplified.WL363HQ adapts to the combined stress by maintaining stable SOD activity and gradually accumulating soluble sugar; WL319HQ shows sensitivity due to fluctuating SOD, membrane lipid peroxidation, and uncontrolled soluble sugar.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

K.; Kumar, R.; Nandula, V.; Tharayil, N.", "abstract": "Environmental stress triggers coordinated changes across genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels in plants, yet the extent of synchronization across these omic layers remains underexplored. We captured transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic perturbation of glyphosate-resistant (GR) and glyphosate-susceptible (GS) Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) biotypes 24 hours after herbicide treatment, quantifying 30,371 transcripts, 5,606 proteins, and 220 metabolites. Glyphosate perturbed threefold more transcripts and proteins in GS than in GR and caused the accumulation of shikimate intermediates in both biotypes. In GS, glyphosate severely disrupted primary metabolism, including photosynthesis and carbon fixation, leading to a collapse of energy production and impairment of phenylpropanoid and terpenoid biosynthesis, compromising defense and detoxification. In contrast, GR maintained cellular homeostasis, with minimal perturbation in carbon metabolism and upregulation of detoxifying pathways, indicating metabolic rerouting. Integrated multi-omics analysis captured stress responses hidden from single-omic analysis, including elevated glutathione metabolism, perturbation of the phenylpropanoid pathway and elevated raffinose family oligosaccharide metabolism in GR, and perturbation of taurine-hypotaurine metabolism in GS. Transcript and protein changes were broadly correlated, but GS exhibited signs of translational inhibition under glyphosate stress, indicating reduced protein synthesis. These findings reveal pervasive perturbation of glyphosate beyond the shikimate pathway within 24 hours after exposure, and underscore the importance of multi-omics integration to elucidate complex stress responses in plants.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

While CD8+CD103+ T cells with a tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cell phenotype have been favourably correlated with patient prognoses, the tumour microenvironment also contains dysfunctional exhausted T (TEX) cells that exhibit a myriad of TRM-like features, leading to conflation of these two populations. Here, we deconvolute TRM and TEX cells within the intratumoural CD8+CD103+ T cell pool across human cancers, ascribing markers and gene signatures that distinguish these CD8+ populations and enable their functional distinction. We found that while TRM cells exhibit superior functionality and are associated with long-term survival post-tumour resection, they are not associated with responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. Deconvolution of the two populations showed that tumour-associated TEX and TRM cells are clonally distinct, with the latter comprising both tumour-independent bystanders and tumour-specific cells segregated from their cognate antigen. Intratumoural TRM cells can be forced towards an exhausted fate when chronic antigen stimulation occurs, arguing that the presence or absence of continuous antigen exposure within the microenvironment is the key distinction between respective tumour-associated TEX and TRM populations. These results suggest unique roles for TRM and TEX cells in tumour control, underscoring the need for distinct strategies to harness these T cell populations in novel cancer therapies.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

K.; Deborah, R. R.; Kremer, K.; Shore, M.; Vogel, H.", "abstract": "The subsurface biosphere remains poorly characterized, with many resident microorganisms uncultured and lacking genomic references. Despite the growing accessibility of shotgun metagenomics, 16S rRNA gene sequencing remains a standard tool for microbial community profiling, often relying on sequence similarity to reference databases such as SILVA to infer taxonomy and potential function. However, in environments with low biomass and high proportions of unknown lineages, such as deeper sedimentary environments, the accuracy of these inferences and our ability to capture rare taxa remain uncertain. A better inference of these rare taxa may now be possible with the advent of accurate long-read applications that have recently become available. Here we provide a comparison of long-read (PacBio) and short-read (Illumina HHHNextSeq) 16S rRNA approaches for microbial communities from a sediment core of Lake Arnon (Switzerland). We compared community composition in environmental samples and mock controls to evaluate the strengths and limitations of each method. While sequencing technology significantly influenced observed community structure, sediment depth had an even stronger effect. Taxonomic profiles were broadly consistent across methods for most bacterial groups, but archaeal diversity was underrepresented in the long-read data, likely due to primer mismatch. When detected, long-read sequencing offered more accurate taxonomic resolution, often down to the species level, enabling better inference of metabolic potential. Beta diversity patterns were similar at broad taxonomic levels between methods, though more detailed metrics such as species contributions to beta diversity (SCBD) and co-occurrence networks showed enhanced resolution and specificity in long-read datasets. Our results highlight the critical importance of primer design, in particular for capturing archaeal taxa that play important roles in the deep biosphere. With improved primer coverage and continued cost reductions, long-read sequencing holds strong potential for advancing our understanding of subsurface microbial identity, structure and function.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

Since 2020, clade 2.3.4.4b H5 high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have driven a global panzootic, causing mass mortality in wild birds, poultry, and, for the first time, repeated spillover infections in a variety of mammalian species. This resurgence of H5 HPAIV has coincided with a dramatic increase in the number of circulating reassortant strains; however, the scale, impact and drivers of these reassortants remain unknown. Here, we combined statistical and phylodynamic modelling to reconstruct the global evolutionary dynamics of H5Nx viruses across four epizootic seasons (2020-2024). We identified 209 genetically distinct reassortants, stratified into three transmission categories based on their phylogenetic and epidemiological profiles. Accounting for sampling depth and HPAIV incidence, we estimated that reassortants emerged most frequently in Asia, but `major' reassortants associated with increased host range, inter-seasonal persistence, and long-range dissemination, more frequently emerged from Europe. Altogether, reassortant emergence followed an episodic pattern in which most reassortants were transient, but 3% seeded large clusters of secondary reassortants soon after their own emergence. Statistical modelling revealed that reassortant success was strongly shaped by ecological factors, including circulation in specific wild bird orders and the ability to infect a wider range of host niches. Reassortant dispersal was linked to poultry trade intensity, particularly in North America. Collectively, our findings reveal reassortment dynamics in H5 HPAIVs and identify key virological and ecological drivers underpinning the emergence and global spread of successful reassortants. These insights support the importance of enhanced surveillance to track evolution of H5 HPAIV and identify traits relevant for consideration in pandemic risk assessment.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

R.; Ward, M. C.", "abstract": "CX-5461 (CX) is a chemotherapeutic drug currently under investigation for the treatment of late-stage cancers. While CX was first described as an RNA polymerase I inhibitor, it has recently been shown to primarily inhibit the beta isoform of topoisomerase II. This isoform is also inhibited by anthracycline drugs including Doxorubicin (DOX) and mediates the toxic effects of these drugs on the heart. It is unclear whether CX will similarly cause cardiotoxicity. We therefore designed a study to test the effects of CX compared to DOX on iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from six individuals. While both CX and DOX induce cell death in cardiomyocytes, CX is 20-fold less cytotoxic than DOX. At sub-lethal doses, DOX induces DNA damage, while CX does not. Transcriptome profiling following treatment with two sub-micromolar concentrations of both drugs over time reveals that DOX induces thousands of gene expression changes compared to hundreds induced by CX. Comparison of gene expression trajectories across drugs reveals that genes that respond to CX also respond to DOX, while most DOX response genes are drug specific. Shared response genes correspond to pathways related to chromosome segregation and DNA replication. CX does not affect the expression of any of the genes in functionally-validated loci associated with DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Our data demonstrate that CX treatment of cardiomyocytes induces gene expression changes that mirror a subset of those induced by DOX; however these changes do not coincide with the cardiotoxicity observed with DOX treatment.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

I.; Muharram, A.; Kamhi, E.; Agami, R.; Sperling, J.; Hafner, M.; Elnitski, L.; Sperling, R.", "abstract": "Accurate splicing, which involves the controlled removal of non-coding sequences (introns) from precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs), is essential for producing correct mature mRNAs that encode functional proteins. Within pre-mRNAs, latent splice sites (LSSs) resemble proper splice sites but are usually not used because their activation can introduce in-frame STOP codons. The nuclear suppression of splicing (SOS) mechanism prevents the use of LSSs. Although the SOS mechanism is not fully understood, recent studies have identified initiator-tRNA and the NCL protein as key components. To discover additional regulators, we performed a genetic screen targeting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with an siRNA library and a luminescence reporter for latent splice site activation. This identified five RBPs, ALYREF (THOC4), PPIE, DDX41, DHX38, and HNRNPA2B1, whose knockdown significantly increased LSS usage in the reporter. RNA-Seq analysis after knocking down each of these RBPs confirmed these results, showing widespread LSS activation in hundreds of mRNAs. Among these, we focused on ALYREF, a conserved protein involved in mRNA export and splicing. Using fPAR-CLIP, we found that U5 snRNA is ALYREF's main binding partner. Overexpressing ALYREF deletion mutants activated latent splicing, and affinity purification confirmed its interaction with U5 snRNA. These mutants exhibited different binding properties, highlighting the importance of specific structural elements within ALYREF in SOS regulation. Our findings reveal that nuclear RBPs play a key role in suppressing LSS activation and suggest that ALYREF has a novel role in maintaining splicing accuracy within the spliceosome, advancing our understanding of the SOS mechanism.", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": ""}

The approach includes a rapid ({approx}5 hours) and cost-efficient (< $25 USD/sample) nanopore sequencing protocol that provides surveillance of a panel of drug resistance-associated genes, hrp2/3 gene deletions, the vaccine target csp, and the highly diverse gene ama1. We coupled this to a bioinformatics dashboard that runs offline on a laptop and displays mapping and variant calling results in real-time.

In view of the working environment and biomechanics properties of operators of special equipment, theoretical and experimental method was presented to analyze the fatigue mechanism and accumulate data samples, and then a new approach was proposed to recognize muscle fatigue by classifying these datasets. Firstly, in order to deduce fatigue mechanism, hidden Markov chain was adopted to build five-element theoretical model for studying interaction between machines and operators muscles during operation process, so that influence factors and tested points of muscles were approached Surface electromyographic (sEMG) sensors were introduced to acquire muscle signals which were taken as sample data, and wavelet packet was adopted to extract features of these data. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model based on partial attention mechanism (PAM) was proposed to execute triple fatigue classification, moreover cross entropy-Adam algorithm was applied to train and optimize this model. Finally, large crane operators were taken as case studies to verify the proposed model.

Under the unique conditions prevailing within the condensate--characterized by sharp cell-density gradients and the absence of physical boundaries--correlated bacterial motion leads to vortex-like cell motion with an additional substantial radial component directed down the cell-density gradient. Correlated bacterial motion leads, in turn, to local fluid motion that tends to broaden the condensate and expels non-chemotactic bacteria. However, when cells are embedded in a porous environment, correlated motion is suppressed, allowing spontaneous condensation to proceed further and form exceptionally dense bacterial accumulations.
