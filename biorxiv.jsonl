Single cell gene expression studies have mostly focused on characterization of neuronal cell diversity; however, recent studies have also revealed substantial diversity of glial cells, particularly astrocytes. To better understand glial cell types and their roles in neurobiology, we built a new suite of adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based genetic tools to enable genetic access to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These oligodendrocyte and astrocyte enhancer-AAVs are highly specific (usually > 95% cell type specificity) with variable expression levels, and the astrocyte enhancer-AAVs show multiple distinct expression patterns reflecting the spatial distribution of astrocyte cell types. To provide the best glial-specific functional tools, several enhancer-AAVs were: optimized for higher expression levels, shown to be functional and specific in rat and macaque, shown to maintain specific activity across transgenes and in epilepsy where traditional promoters changed activity, and used to drive functional transgenes in astrocytes including Cre recombinase and acetylcholine-responsive sensor iAChSnFR. The astrocyte-specific iAChSnFR revealed a clear reward-dependent acetylcholine response in astrocytes of the nucleus accumbens during reinforcement learning. Together, this collection of glial enhancer-AAVs will enable characterization of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte populations and their roles across species, disease states, and behavioral epochs.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

H.; Pascucci, D.", "abstract": "Postdictive effects, where later events influence the perception of earlier ones, suggest that conscious perception is preceded by extended periods of unconscious processing. In the Sequential Metacontrast Paradigm (SQM), offsets of verniers are unconsciously integrated over several hundred milliseconds. Regardless of whether one or multiple verniers are shown, only a single offset is perceived along a motion stream. The SQM and other postdictive phenomena thus provide a unique opportunity to dissociate unconscious from conscious stages of visual processing, as these stages are well separated in time. Using EEG during the SQM, we identified two distinct stages of neural activity: an early occipital EEG activity pattern (~200 ms after the initial vernier) associated with unconscious processing, and a later centro-parietal EEG pattern (~400-600 ms after SQM onset) associated with the integrated percept and behavioral report. We propose that the transition between these neural topographies reflects the moment when the percept becomes consciously accessible.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

In centrosomal systems, this occurs primarily through directed transport along polarized microtubule tracks to plus ends, but how non-centrosomal microtubule arrays organize exocytosis remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate this question in plant cells, which completely lack centrosomes and form planar cortical microtubule arrays. We identify the exocytotic protein KEULE, an essential SEC/MUNC, as a dynamic marker for exocytosis that forms clusters associated with and is required for discrete exocytotic events in growing Arabidopsis cells. Live cell imaging revealed that these clusters have stereotyped patterns of protein accumulation and loss, suggesting distinct phases in the assembly and function of exocytotic protein complexes. Super-resolution image analysis and Bayesian inference for distance distributions revealed that exocytotic events are not randomly distributed but are significantly enriched in ~180 nm wide linear domains flanking cortical microtubules, while being under-represented in adjacent ~520 nm domains. Thus, cortical microtubule arrays act as two-dimensional spatial templates for exocytosis, representing a fundamentally different organizational modality from centrosomal arrays that may be conserved across non-centrosomal arrays.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

However, existing methods fall short in preserving critical structures such as capillary junctions and bifurcations, thus limiting clinical applications and causing fragmentation. To address these limitations, we propose DFMS Net, a novel dual-field segmentation framework that synergistically integrates geometric field modeling achieved through the Spatial Pathway Extractor (SPE) and Transformer-based Topology Interaction (TTI) for preserving structural continuity and functional field optimization realized by the Semantic Attention Amplification (SAA) module for enhancing semantic visibility via a unified Dual-Field Hemodynamic Attention (DFHA) mechanism. This core module enables joint enhancement of vessel continuity, accurate resolution of complex branching patterns, and recovery of low-contrast capillaries, all under physiological guidance. By co-optimizing geometric and functional cues within a unified attention learning paradigm, DFMS-Net produces segmentations that are both morphologically accurate and hemodynamically plausible. Furthermore, we propose two specialized variants using a streamlined Double SPE Attention for vessel continuity refinement. To address the directionality-dependent nature of structural damage in retinal ischemia and glaucoma, we propose Variant1 a streamlined architecture that emphasizes dual-stage directional refinement to enhance trajectory coherence and improve the detection of topological disruptions, while Variant2 supports high-resolution analysis of capillary dropout in early diabetic retinopathy through detailed microvascular recovery. Extensive experiments on retinal (DRIVE, STARE) and coronary angiography (DCA1, CHUAC) datasets demonstrate that DFMS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The dominant approach, which involves searching for the orientation that maximizes cross-correlation relative to given templates, is sub-optimal, particularly under low signal-to-noise conditions. In this work, we propose a Bayesian framework for more accurate and flexible orientation estimation, with the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator serving as a key example. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the MMSE estimator consistently outperforms the cross-correlation-based method, especially in challenging low signal-to-noise scenarios, and we provide a theoretical framework that supports these improvements. When incorporated into iterative refinement algorithms in the 3D reconstruction pipeline, the MMSE estimator markedly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces model bias, and enhances robustness to the ``Einstein from Noise'' artifact. Crucially, we demonstrate that orientation estimation accuracy has a decisive effect on downstream structural heterogeneity analysis. In particular, integrating the MMSE-based pose estimator into frameworks for continuous heterogeneity recovery yields accuracy improvements approaching those obtained with ground-truth poses, establishing MMSE-based pose estimation as a key enabler of high-fidelity conformational landscape reconstruction. These findings indicate that the proposed Bayesian framework could substantially advance cryo-EM and cryo-ET by enhancing the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of 3D molecular structure reconstruction, thereby facilitating deeper insights into complex biological systems.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

We find that life span costs of reproduction became higher in mothers exposed to the famine during reproduction, and for these mothers amounted to lower life expectancy of ~0.5 years per child. Conversely, reproduction did not shape the life spans of mothers not exposed to the famine, or exposed post-reproduction or during development. This natural experiment reveals how environmental adversity can influence reproductive costs, providing a biological explanation for previous inconsistent findings, while showing how reproductive behavior has shaped the evolution of aging in humans.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Experiments in model systems generate interpretable gene networks but, in isolation, do not establish relevance to the human condition. Statistical genetics identifies relevant association signals at the variant or gene level but lacks tools to test specific mechanistic models, as existing methods do not incorporate the topology of gene-gene interactions. We bridge these two strategies by introducing a method that competitively tests network hypotheses with rare variant associations. A hierarchical model-based association test NERINE for the first time incorporates gene network topology while remaining resilient to network inaccuracies. We demonstrate NERINE's ability to test network hypotheses derived from both canonical pathway databases and model system screens. Comprehensive database-wide search of pathway networks with NERINE uncovers compelling associations for breast cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and type II diabetes, which are undetected by single-gene tests. Testing bespoke networks from experimental screens targeting key PD pathologies: dopaminergic neuron survival and -synuclein pathobiology, NERINE highlights rare variant burden in gene modules related to autophagy, vesicle trafficking, and protein homeostasis. Genome-scale CRISPRi-screening of -synuclein toxicity modifiers in human neurons and NERINE converge on PRL, revealing an intraneuronal -synuclein/prolactin stress response that may impact resilience to PD pathologies.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

H1 functions as a liquid-like \"glue\", mediating dynamic multivalent electrostatic interactions between nucleosomes within chromatin domains. Consistently, rapid-depletion of H1.2 leads to decondensed chromatin domains both in cells and in silico.

Our data reveal differential methylation of these positions between splicing isoforms. Eleven of these sites are clustered in two short segments (197 nt and 43 nt) with peak-shaped methylation profiles. Single-molecule analysis revealed that a very small number of transcripts were unmethylated in both clusters ([&le;] 1.5% of spliced transcripts and [&le;] 5.4% of unspliced viral RNA). We also identified a ~732 nt RNA species resulting from the transcription of non-integrated viral DNA circles closed by two long terminal repeats (2-LTR circles). These transcripts started in the first LTR, terminated at the polyA site of the second LTR and harbored six m6A sites. Five of these sites were present in other transcripts and, remarkably, had the highest methylation rates.

We studied effects of different visual perturbations in 16 healthy young participants walking on a treadmill, by assessing foot placement and center of mass (CoM) states. Three different visual perturbations were applied: fixating on a stationary target while the background moved to the right (MB), tracking the target moving rightward over a stationary background with head rotation (MT-HR), and tracking the moving target with eye movement only (MT-EM). Deviations of foot placement, CoM and trunk orientation due to the visual perturbation were assessed. Linear models were fit to the kinematic data to predict foot placement from CoM state at mid-swing. Over the whole trial, MT-HR and MT-EM caused an increase in step width variability, CoM position variability and foot placement residual error simultaneously. During visual perturbation epochs specifically, in MB, a left deviation of foot and CoM trajectories was observed from the start of the background movement. In MT-HR and MT-EM, a right deviation of foot and CoM trajectories was observed only after the target had stopped moving. Contrary to our expectations, foot placement errors did not coincide with subsequent CoM deviations in the opposite direction. An obvious change in frontal plane trunk orientation was found only in MT-HR. While all visual perturbations affected control of the CoM trajectory in the frontal plane, these effects appeared caused by effects on control of heading as well. Head rotation appears to additionally disturb balance through a coupling with trunk orientation.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

We determined that flowers opened at 6 day-post-inoculation (DPI) are optimal for high transformation efficiency, with nearly 100% of siliques harboring transformants. However, Agrobacterium infection induced ovule abortion, particularly in wild-type (Col-0) plants, whereas efr mutants lacking the EF-Tu receptor (EFR)-mediated pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) showed reduced ovule abortion. Notably, efr mutants exhibited more RUBY-positive ovules and significantly enhanced genome editing efficiency. Two engineered stealth Agrobacterium strains (AS201 and AS202) expressing a chimeric EF-Tu for evading recognition by EFR enhanced both transient transformation and genome editing efficiency.

Using a grid search of 36 parameter combinations, we evaluated four agronomic traits with five metrics: Pearson's r, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Fleiss' &#954 for stability. Our findings show that a low learning rate combined with a high number of boosting rounds substantially improves prediction stability (ICC > 0.98) and selection stability (Fleiss' &#954 > 0.80), while reducing train-test performance gaps. This combination produced concurrent improvements for predictive accuracy (r) and ranking efficiency (NDCG), though optimal settings were trait-dependent. Conversely, classification accuracy (AUC) was poor and performed relatively better with higher learning rates, revealing a conflict in optimization hyperparameters. Despite moderate Pearson's r and poor AUC in this challenging cross-season, cross-environment prediction scenario, NDCG remained high (> 0.85), indicating strong ability to rank top-performing entries.

For instance, fishing bans, aimed at enhancing fish biodiversity in eastern China, may counteract the effectiveness of nutrient control measures in mitigating eutrophication. This study employs a dual modeling approach to evaluate this hypothesis in Lake Hongze, the fourth largest shallow lake in China. The PCLake model was calibrated using observational data from Lake Hongze collected between 2016 and 2020. The calibrated model was subsequently applied in a hindcast analysis from 2020 to 2024 and a forecast simulation from 2025 to 2030 to assess the impacts of fishing bans. Combined with structural equation modeling (SEM) path analysis, the results support the hypothesis that fishing bans can exhibit antagonistic effects on nutrient loading control by enhancing top-down regulation relative to bottom-up processes. Specifically, the fishing ban led to increased fish biomass, phytoplankton abundance, and nutrient levels over the past four years, while reducing the abundance of submerged macrophytes, zoobenthos, and zooplankton.

A key example is biological motion perception, which relies on priors, or lifelong expectations about how bodies move. Yet it remains unclear how these priors shape the dynamics of neural prediction across hierarchical levels. Using a new dynamic extension to representational similarity analysis (dRSA), we measured how the brain of human participants predicted continuous dance movements recorded with magnetoencephalography. Under normal viewing conditions predictions followed a hierarchy: high-level viewpoint-invariant body motion was predicted earliest, while viewpoint-dependent body motion and low-level pixelwise motion were predicted closer to real-time. Disrupting high-level long-term priors by inverting videos selectively reduced high-level predictions. Instead, disrupting low-level short-term kinematics priors by piecewise scrambling eliminated all motion prediction, while increasing post-stimulus responses. These findings reveal how high- and low-level priors jointly shape predictive perception of naturalistic continuous input.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

We have previously identified a population of late-forming endothelial progenitor cells in zebrafish embryos (termed secondary vascular field, SVF), which emerge from the lateral plate mesoderm after 24 hpf stage, after blood circulation has been initiated. Here we investigate the functional role of SVF cells and the molecular mechanisms that govern the emergence of these SVF cells and their contribution to vasculature. We identified that the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 and Junctional Adhesion Molecule Jam2b are expressed in the SVF-forming region and are required for the emergence of SVF cells in zebrafish embryos. Time-lapse imaging and jam2b:Cre based lineage tracing showed that SVF cells serve as the major source of the intestinal vasculature, including the supraintestinal artery (SIA) and subintestinal vein (SIV), which are subsequently remodeled to provide the blood flow to many internal organs. To analyze the functional role of jam2b and a related jam2a gene in vascular development, we generated double maternal-zygotic jam2a; jam2b mutants, which display a greatly reduced number of SVF cells and show defects in the intestinal vasculature development. Further analysis showed that hand2 functions in the SVF-forming region upstream of jam2b and is required to induce expression of transcription factor etv2/etsrp, a known master regulator of vasculogenesis. In summary, our results identify new roles for Jam2 signaling and Hand2 function in the emergence of organ-specific vascular progenitors. The presence of similar progenitors in mammalian embryos suggests that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

We identified a unique Cholesterol Recognition Amino acid Consensus (CRAC) motif in VapC12 toxin and demonstrated that its heterologous expression induces toxicity in M. smegmatis. We have solved the crystal structure of VapB12 antitoxin at a 1.6A0 wavelength and using molecular modeling predicted the structure of TA complex. Structure-function analysis revealed specific residues critical for the assembly and activity of the VapBC12 TA system.

A vast network based literature has employed functional connectivity (FC), primarily using resting-state and task-based fMRI. However, methodological limitations have hindered this approach in language processing, particularly during speech production. Here, we address this gap by employing a large cohort of electrocorticographic (ECoG) patients (N=42) to investigate the networks driving speech perception and production. We acquired data while patients were engaged in a controlled battery of speech production tasks focusing on five cognitive states (auditory perception, picture perception, reading perception, speech production, and baseline). Using linear classifiers we were able to robustly decode cognitive states from single-trial FC (i.e. Pearson correlations) of the neural activity patterns, achieving a mean accuracy of 64.4%. These classifiers revealed distinct network signatures underlying auditory and visual perception as well as speech production via stable network connectivity. Importantly, the network signatures included both regions with robust local neural activity and those with minimal or no detectable activation. Such signatures indicate that even low-activity regions contribute critically to differentiating cognitive states. Our findings underscore the significance of functional connectivity analysis as a complementary dimension to investigating local neural activity, and suggest that the functional networks supporting speech extend beyond the most metabolically active regions.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

However, how thalamus-cortex interactions influence human cortical development remains unknown primarily because of the inaccessibility of the human embryonic brain. Here, we demonstrate thalamus-dependent gene expression, circuit organization, and neural activity during corticogenesis using human thalamocortical assembloids (hThCAs). Human cortical and thalamic organoids (hCOs and hThOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells exhibited region-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal activity. Upon the fusion of these organoids, hThCAs reconstructed reciprocal thalamus-cortex axonal projections and synaptic connections. Transcriptomic analysis revealed thalamus-dependent acceleration of cortical maturation, with upregulation of programs linked to axon development, subplate/cortical plate identity, and activity-regulated genes. Histological analysis showed expanded progenitor pools and increased deep-layer neurons within hThCAs. Wide-field Ca2+ imaging demonstrated that wave-like activity originated in the thalamic region and propagated to the cortical region. Furthermore, two-photon Ca2+ imaging of cortical neurons revealed that synchronous activity emerged exclusively in pyramidal tract (PT) and corticothalamic (CT) neurons, whereas intratelencephalic (IT) neurons remain asynchronous, highlighting cell type-specific circuit integration within hThCAs. These synchronized events were absent in isolated hCOs or in cortico-cortical assembloids, underscoring the specificity of thalamic input. Our findings suggest that diffusible thalamic cues broadly enhance progenitor expansion, while long-range thalamic input organizes cell type-specific synchronous activity. This study demonstrates the thalamus-dependent acquisition of mature cortical phenotypes in a cell type-specific manner in hThCAs, establishing developmental mechanisms linking regional interactions and cell type-specific circuit specification. Thus, hThCAs provide a tractable human platform for dissecting human-specific developmental processes and modeling neurodevelopmental disorders with disrupted thalamocortical communication at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Moreover, gap10 localizes to basal bodies of motile cilia in multiciliated cells, where it regulates basal body organization and apical actin enrichment by recruiting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to specialized ciliary adhesion complexes.

Social and sensory experiences shape how multisensory information is processed and integrated; however, we have less understanding of how multimodal recognition may be modulated by early sensory experience in a single modality. Zebra finches are gregarious songbirds that form lifelong pair-bonds with a single partner whom they recognize acoustically and visually. However, it is unknown to what extent multisensory signals might interact to enable recognition or whether this is affected by auditory exposure during development. In this paper, we tested females for responses to audio and visual stimuli from their mate or a stranger in a digital cross-modal expectancy violation paradigm. Using automated pose tracking, we determined that, like many species, zebra finches react differently when the stimuli are congruent versus incongruent. However, while birds reared in a colony setting and birds reared without exposure to adult song both detected audiovisual congruency, the degree of behaviors exhibited differed between the rearing conditions. Thus, multisensory integration appears to be important for females to identify their mates, but differences in developmental environment influence how recognition is behaviorally expressed.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Such signal shapes the activity of mPFC dopaminoceptive neurons during reversal learning through the recruitment of heteromers formed by dopamine D1 and D2 receptors with NMDA receptors. In accordance, blockade of either D1/NMDA or D2/NMDA heteromers in the mPFC selectively impairs reversal of outcome identities but not learning and expression of initial action-outcome associations.

We examined shared and distinct abnormalities in brain activation and circuit connectivity associated with inhibitory control in non-comorbid ADHD and ASD. Methods: Brain activity and hyperdirect pathway connectivity during inhibitory control were examined in children with non-comorbid ADHD (age: 11.1{+/-}0.24y) and children with non-comorbid ASD (age: 11.1{+/-}0.39y), compared with typically developing (TD) children (age: 10.9{+/-}0.09y), and benchmarked against healthy adults (age: 24.1{+/-}1.26y), using fMRI stop-signal task data. Results: Both ADHD and ASD groups showed reduced activation in salience and frontoparietal network regions alongside increased activation in default mode network (DMN) regions, consistent with triple-network dysfunction. These activation deficits were more pronounced in ASD, whose activation profile also diverged most from adults. At the circuit level, only ASD showed abnormal hyperdirect connectivity, involving insula-STN and preSMA-STN pathways and further reflected in a composite insula/IFG-STN connectivity measure, indicating broader cortical-STN disruption. Importantly, across all children, reduced salience/frontoparietal relative to DMN engagement correlated with greater parent-reported inhibitory control deficits, and in ASD, individual differences in insula/IFG-STN connectivity showed the same association, highlighting the behavioral relevance of both network- and circuit-level abnormalities. Conclusions: ADHD and ASD share network-level but differ in circuit-level abnormalities underlying inhibitory control deficits.

A stimulus might be highly desirable in one context but completely unappealing in another. However, it is not known how the brain can support such flexible modulation of overall stimulus value. Here we test a model of flexible value construction whereby individual attributes of a stimulus are converted into contextually dependent attribute-specific value representations before being combined into an overall integrated stimulus value. To test this framework, human participants (online n=95, MRI n=35) provided ratings for 75 unique high-dimensional clothing stimuli under three instructed `goal-contexts` designed to elicit differences in overall value judgments for the items. Integrated value ratings for each stimulus were found to be goal-context dependent, while individual stimulus-attributes varied markedly in how they contributed to value ratings across goal contexts. In the fMRI data, representations of the absolute levels of particular attributes were revealed in visual areas. In contrast, encoding of individual attributes in value space, alongside integrated overall stimulus value, was present within distinct regions of prefrontal cortex. More specifically, behaviorally relevant attributes in value space and integrated stimulus value were found in vmPFC and dmPFC respectively. These findings indicate that the construction of value for high-dimensional stimuli is achieved through the computation of goal-context-dependent attributes in value space, providing mechanistic insight into how the brain can flexibly modulate stimulus-values as context changes.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

While astrocytes typically promote neuron outgrowth, co-culture of RTT astrocytes with wildtype neurons inhibits their outgrowth, implicating secreted astrocyte factors in RTT pathology. However, the specific factors and their contributions to RTT deficits remain poorly defined. To address this, we focused on the class 3 semaphorin SEMA3C, which shows increased astrocyte secretion in RTT and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Using astrocyte and neuron cell culture, we find that SEMA3C is inhibitory to dendrite outgrowth via PLXND1 and NRP2 receptors in cortical neurons. Genetic reduction of astrocyte SEMA3C in female RTT model mice enhances dendritic arborization and normalizes synaptic activity. Behaviorally, astrocyte SEMA3C reduction normalizes visual acuity and motor behavior, which are established clinical features in RTT.

A major challenge in infection transcriptomics is that cells are often at different infection stages.

To quantify network-level disruption, we applied graph-theoretical analyses, including a novel within-subject adaptation of the Hub Disruption Index and Covariate-Constrained Manifold Learning (CCML), an unsupervised embedding technique sensitive to subject-level covariates. Moreover, we assessed subjective sleep quality, sleepiness, and circadian traits. Results: Both TSD and CSR were associated with a consistent reorganization of graph topology relative to RW. Furthermore, direct comparisons revealed that TSD and CSR affect different brain hubs. Regional changes in degree, closeness, and clustering coefficients were most prominent in subsystems of the default mode network, frontoparietal network, and cerebellum. These differences were also captured in CCML embeddings, supporting the hypothesis that acute and chronic sleep deprivation exert divergent effects on brain connectivity. Findings were robust across graph thresholds, brain atlases, and nodal metrics. Moreover, these results were further supported by the subjective measures - sleepiness was associated with reduced network integration in RW, and circadian phenotype emerged as a key determinant of individual sensitivity to sleep loss.

This study used remote cameras to determine leopard density, generalized linear models to investigate leopard space-use in relation to key anthropogenic, ecological and environmental variables, and fitted kernel density curves to identify temporal activity patterns in this unprotected, human-dominated region. Adult leopard density (8.82/100 km{superscript 2}) was lower here than in key Sri Lankan National Parks, but not significantly so, suggesting good leopard habitat suitability. Spatially, leopards did not avoid humans but incorporated anthropogenic factors into space-use decisions, with areas of intermediate human and dog presence disproportionately used. Male leopards were more likely to occur at intermediate distances from human settlements, perhaps balancing risk with efficiency while navigating this human-dominated landscape. Female leopards biased space-use towards areas of high natural prey availability, aligning with their need to provide for cubs. Temporally, leopards were significantly less diurnal and more active at dusk than their protected counterparts, likely due to temporal partitioning from diurnally active humans, an adaptation which allows for human-leopard co-existence. This is the first comprehensive study of leopards outside protected areas in Sri Lanka, and highlights the value of unprotected landscapes and their importance for long-term leopard conservation. To foster human-leopard co-existence it is necessary to maintain current human activity patterns which allow for temporal partitioning; ensure existing natural prey resources remain to prevent leopards switching to domestic prey species; and reduce/eliminate the use of wire snares which transcend the effect of temporal partitioning by de-coupling persecution risk from human presence.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Impaired mechanical function in tendon limits mobility and results from fatigue-induced damage progression that outpaces the restorative processes maintaning tissue health, a phenomenom we term mechanopathology. Early and non-invasive detection of tendon mechanopathologies is vital to prevent further damage, but is lacking in the clinical space. Here, we evaluate the ability of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) to detect mechanical fatigue damage in tendon, and validate our findings using histologic assessments of collagen fiber microstructure and molecular structure. We found that fatigue-induced changes in DT-MRI metrics of tendon are spatially heterogeneous, and correspond to regions with damaged collagen fiber microstructure. While secondary structures of collagen molecules were damaged by fatigue loading, they do not spatially correspond to fatigue-induced changes in DT-MRI metrics. Fatigue-induced changes in DT-MRI metrics can be partially explained by quantitative metrics of post-fatigue collagen fiber microstructure, estimating the limit of detection of DT-MRI metrics to fatigue-induced damage in tendon. Our findings indicate that DT-MRI metrics are sensitive to fatigue-induced local damage in tendon, supporting the potential of DT-MRI as a non-invasive and translatable tool to clinically detect mechanopathologies in tendon.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Here we exploited the heterotrophic growth ability of Cyclotella cryptica to create the first diatom photosynthetic mutant by CRISPR-Cas inactivation of the nucleus-encoded ATP synthase subunit {gamma}. These mutants showed impaired phototrophic capacity and altered thylakoids morphology. In absence of {gamma}-ATP, protons that accumulate in the thylakoid lumen slow down the cytochrome b6f complex, thus keeping the electron carriers downhill oxidized. These results, reversible when the proton gradient is suppressed, demonstrate the existence of a photosynthetic control in diatoms. At variance with the wild type, {gamma}-ATP synthase mutants cannot grow heterotrophically in darkness nor in the light when photosystem II is inhibited. This requirement of heterotrophic growth on photosynthetic electron transfer or on the presence of plastidial ATP synthase suggests that the proton motive force (pmf) is a central integrator of the metabolic interaction between photosynthesis and heterotrophy.

Both patients carrying PD-associated variants in GBA1, encoding lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and a subset of non-carrier patients have been shown to have reduced GCase enzymatic activity, suggesting that reduced GCase activity may be a feature of both genetic and a subset of sporadic PD. However, the effect of PD-associated variants in LRRK2, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, on GCase activity remains controversial, with conflicting results in various tissues and cell types. Moreover, rare patients carrying both GBA1 and LRRK2 risk alleles seem to have a more benign disease course than carriers of GBA1 variants alone, suggesting a complex interplay between these two genes in PD. Here we evaluate the effect of LRRK2 kinase activity on GCase activity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia (iMGs), a PD-relevant brain cell type expressing high levels of LRRK2. Using CRISPR editing, isogenic control iPSC lines were generated to match PD patient-derived iPSC lines harbouring the LRRK2 p.G2019S, p.M1646T, or p.N551K-p.R1398H protective haplotype variants. Whereas iMGs harbouring the p.M1646T variant, and the protective haplotype, respectively increased and decreased phosphorylation of canonical LRRK2 substrate, Rab10, GCase protein levels and activity were not altered in any of the LRRK2 variant lines. Additionally, whereas pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity had no impact on GCase activity in iMGs under basal conditions, it attenuated the increase in GCase activity elicited in response to interferon {gamma} (IFN{gamma}) treatment. Moreover, GCase activity induced by IFN{gamma} was reduced in PD risk LRRK2 p.M1646T iMGs and increased in p.N551K-p.R1398H protective haplotype iMGs compared to their isogenic corrected controls, congruent with their respective effects on LRRK2 kinase activity and PD risk.

Our time-resolved sub-diffraction optical chromatin architecture tracing of >100,000 alleles in individual lymphoma cells further revealed diverse topological conformations facilitating multi-enhancer interactions.

Circular megabase-sized ecDNAs lack centromeres and segregate stochastically during cell division yet persist over many generations. EcDNAs were first observed to hitchhike on mitotic chromosomes into daughter cell nuclei over 40 years ago with unknown mechanism. Here we identify a family of human genomic elements, termed retention elements, that tether episomes to mitotic chromosomes to increase ecDNA transmission to daughter cells. We develop Retain-seq, a genome-scale assay that reveals thousands of human retention elements conferring generational persistence to heterologous episomes. Retention elements comprise a select set of CpG-rich gene promoters and act additively. Live-cell imaging and chromatin conformation capture show that retention elements physically interact with mitotic chromosomes at regions which are mitotically bookmarked by transcription factors and chromatin proteins, intermolecularly recapitulating promoter-enhancer interactions. Multiple retention elements are co-amplified with oncogenes on individual ecDNAs in human cancers and shape their sizes and structures. CpG-rich retention elements are focally hypomethylated; targeted cytosine methylation abrogates retention activity and leads to ecDNA loss, suggesting that methylation-sensitive interactions modulate episomal DNA retention. These results highlight the DNA elements and regulatory logic of mitotic ecDNA retention. Amplifications of retention elements promote the maintenance of oncogenic ecDNA across generations of cancer cells, revealing the principles of episome immortality intrinsic to the human genome.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Wistar rats were exposed to ethanol to induce liver damage, followed by treatment with VA extract (100-300 mg/kg) or silymarin (50 mg/kg). Liver function indices were evaluated through biochemical analysis. Network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify active compounds and their protein targets, and molecular docking assessed the binding affinities of key compounds. Ethanol exposure markedly increased serum SGOT, SGPT, ALKP, and total bilirubin while decreasing total protein and albumin. VA treatment significantly corrected these alterations in a dose-dependent manner. At 300 mg/kg, VA reduced SGPT from 110.31 to 88.65 U/mL, ALKP from 52.20 to 28.14 U/mL, and total bilirubin from 1.19 to 0.59 g/dL. Network pharmacology revealed flavonoids and sesquiterpene lactones as key active compounds targeting ALD-relevant proteins, including AKT1, CASP3, and HSP90AA1. Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinities (-9.5 kcal/mol) of cryptolepine, luteolin, and apigenin with AKT1 and HSP90AA1.

While no potent ChikV Mac1 inhibitors are available, high-affinity inhibitors were developed for Mac1 in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we rationalize this difference in the ligand binding affinity in terms of three differences in the binding site structure and dynamics. First, the apo ChikV Mac1 binding site exhibits substantially more conformational heterogeneity than that of SARS-CoV-2, based on microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations; it also has a less druggable binding site, based on program SiteMap. Second, water binding sites overlapping with the ligand binding site in ChikV Mac1 are predicted by program WaterMap to have a stronger affinity for water molecules than the corresponding sites in SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, thus decreasing ligand binding affinity. Finally, a smaller number of Mac1 residues interacts persistently with ADP- ribose in holo ChikV Mac1 than in SARS-CoV-2. With these rationalizations in hand, we designed ligands of ChikV Mac1 using a fragment growth strategy; subsequent molecular dynamics simulations of a representative ligand in complex with ChikV Mac1 substantiated our design.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

In the present study, we evaluated the time-dependent progression of PD-like pathology by administering rotenone intranasally for 5.5 months in C57BL/6 male mice. We performed olfactory and motor tests and examined the aSyn accumulation, glial cell activation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration after 3, 4 and 5.5 months of rotenone exposure by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence techniques. We observed a time-dependent progression of aSyn accumulation from the OB to other brain regions, including the mid-brain and cortex.

This study used an experimental bovine model of LSDV transmission to quantify the transmission of LSDV from an infected donor to a naive recipient calf. Three species of Diptera representing different vector groups were included (Stomoxys calcitrans, Aedes aegypti and Culicoides nubeculosus, respectively a large biting fly, a mosquito and a midge), and the clinical, virological and immunological outcomes in the recipient calves studied. The ability of Ae. aegypti to mechanically transmit LSDV following feeding on an artificial membrane feeding system was also examined. Both Ae. aegypti and S. calcitrans were able to transmit LSDV, resulting in disease in recipient calves. Bites from virus-positive C. nubeculosus did not result in disease in recipient calves, though the presence of neutralising antibodies in these recipients indicated exposure to virus or virus components. Ae. aegypti successfully transmitted LSDV following feeding on LSDV-spiked blood through an artificial membrane feeding system, validating this laboratory model as a future replacement for donor cattle.

Woodland salamanders, which constitute many of the species in the global hotspot of salamander diversity located in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North America, are thought to cope with harsh winters through dormancy and metabolic suppression. We used a field-based experiment to investigate the winter physiology and energetics of a woodland salamander (Plethodon metcalfi). Despite showing histological signs of dormancy, salamanders exhibited higher metabolic rates during winter than the active season when measured at low temperatures associated with winter, consistent with metabolic compensation. High-elevation salamanders also exhibited elevated metabolic rates at cold temperatures compared to low-elevation salamanders, indicative of countergradient metabolic compensation. When integrated into a biophysical species distribution model, depletion of energy stores estimated from winter metabolic rates under current climates accurately predicted the geographic range limits of our focal species. Under future warming scenarios, incorporating winter physiology indicated that 77% of the species range would experience local extinction due to depletion of energy stores. These findings challenge assumptions about winter energetics, reveal metabolic limits on cold-season survival, and highlight metabolic demands during dormancy as a key constraint on responses to climate change.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Methods: By integrating residue conservation, partial correlation, network centrality, pathogenicity analyses, and evolutionary molecular dynamics in various pH (6.5-10.5) conditions, we explore how these proteins have functionally and evolutionary diversified. Results: Partial correlation-conservation analysis identified JAM-B functions as an evolutionary hub. Network analyses further highlighted Lys and Cys residues in JAM-B as central evolutionary residues. Negatively charged and hydrophobic residues (Tyr, Val, Asp) were conserved at lower-pI (JAM-C). AlphaMissense profiling revealed that acidic->basic mutations exhibit significantly lower pathogenicity scores, particularly in JAM-A and JAM-B. In dynamics simulations, root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) profiles revealed a pI-stability relationship: JAM-B, the highest-pI paralog, remained stable across pH levels, while JAM-A and JAM-C displayed V-shaped pH-dependent deviations (JAM-A at pH 8.0, JAM-C at pH 8.5). Dynamics-aware evolutionary analyses identified key residues combining high evolutionary conservation with pH-sensitive fluctuations: JAM-A at Gln66, JAM-B at Gln36 and Val57, and JAM-C at several basic residues (Lys97, Arg108, Arg123, Arg191).

Rodent studies have demonstrated that exercise training improves WAT function, but molecular studies investigating exercise training effects on WAT in humans have been limited, particularly in the context of metabolic disease. Here, we defined the subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) transcriptome in middle-aged adults (10 male, 19 female) that were classified by lower BMI (<27 kg/m2), higher BMI ([&ge;]27 kg/m2), and T2D status before and after a 10-week endurance exercise regimen. At baseline, 624 genes were significantly upregulated and 112 genes downregulated in the scWAT from higher BMI participants compared to lower BMI. There was a spectrum of pathway dysregulation in scWAT in higher BMI individuals, ranging from increased markers of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and inflammation to decreased circadian rhythm gene expression. In people with T2D, there were additional transcriptomic differences such as translation-related pathways, selenoamino acid metabolism, and proteoglycans. Exercise training had robust effects on the transcriptome regardless of metabolic status, and notably, for the high BMI and T2D groups, training reversed several of the detrimental gene expression patterns in a cell-type-specific manner. These beneficial exercise-induced transcriptomic adaptations significantly correlated with lower levels of free fatty acids and blood pressure, particularly in participants with higher BMI and T2D. By integrating our exercise training-modulated genes with GWAS meta-analysis of physical activity, genes influenced by exercise training in the higher BMI group showed a significant enrichment in genetic associations of exercise traits in the population. A circadian rhythm-related transcription factor NR1D1 was enriched in enhancers linked with both the exercise differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and GWAS signals, suggesting a link between the circadian rhythm and training-induced adaptations. These findings demonstrate that obesity and T2D result in marked, progressive alterations in cell-type specific gene transcription in scWAT, while endurance exercise training reverses many of the metabolic disease-associated adaptations. Identification of novel molecular pathways regulated by exercise training can lead to therapeutic targets for obesity and metabolic disease.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Lipid profiling, acid-fast staining, isoniazid sensitivity, and genome mining confirmed hallmark features of mycolic acid biosynthesis. Evaluation of the strain's metabolic capabilities led to the isolation of bonnevanoside, a thiophenyl nonulopyranoside reported here for the first time from a natural source. Moreover, additional Great Salt Lake-derived Nocardiopsis isolates exhibited acid-fast staining, suggesting that this trait may be more widespread than previously recognized. Altogether, these findings expand the taxonomic distribution of mycolic acid biosynthesis, challenge long-standing chemotaxonomic boundaries, and highlight the potential ecological significance of mycolate-containing envelopes in supporting bacterial survival in extreme environments.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

DosR is recognized as the key dormancy regulator of Mtb due to its global transcriptional regulation in intracellular adaptation and long-term persistence prevailing in latent infection. However, the molecular mechanism regarding DosR-dependent transcription activation remains inadequately defined. Here, we successfully determined the cryo-EM structure of an intact DosR-dependent transcriptional activation complex (DosR-TAC), comprising Mtb RNA polymerase (RNAP), DosR, and the hypoxic promoter DNA. In DosR-TAC, two DosR monomers symmetrically dimerize through their N-terminal receiver domains (DosR_RECs) and the distinct 10 helices of the C-terminal DNA-binding domains (DosR_DBDs). Unlike its inhibitory configuration, the DosR dimer undergoes significant conformational changes within the original linker, isomerizing DosR_REC into a canonical ({beta})5 fold. This extended linker affords the DosR_DBDs and DosRI_REC to contact promoter DNA, while concurrently interacting with the conserved domains of RNAP ({sigma}AR4, CTD, and NTD). Additionally, RT-qPCR and growth curve assays of the wild-type and DosR mutant strains, also unravel the physiological importance of this divergent linker. These findings, together with prior hypotheses regarding DosR, support an allosteric activation-recruitment model for DosR. Altogether, these results highlight the molecular mechanism of DosR-dependent transcription activation critical for dormancy survival of Mtb, and offer potential targets for developing anti-dormancy strategies against persistent tuberculosis.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Bioconversion of the TOD products could be used as feedstocks in a biorefinery concept and lead to new avenues for plastic waste upcycling. Previous work demonstrated this concept with high density polyethylene (HDPE), the most abundant type of plastic, and identified the nonconventional yeast Candida maltosa as a promising candidate for this application. Here we describe the evolution of an improved strain of C. maltosa and characterize the uptake mechanisms of TOD products from HDPE (TOD_HDPE). Batch cultures in series passaged at the mid-exponential growth phase applied a selective pressure for faster growth and resulted in a >100% increase in specific growth rate when using TOD_HDPE as a carbon source. The evolved strain was compared to the parent strain to identify the cellular and biochemical changes associated with the improved phenotype and the uptake mechanisms involved in the bioconversion of TOD_HDPE. This comparison found that C. maltosa secretes biosurfactants capable of solubilizing hydrocarbons. The adaptive evolution resulted in changes in biosurfactant production that translated to improved emulsification of alkanes and increased solubilization of fatty alcohols and alkanes. In addition to the changes in metabolites, the study identified increases in membrane permeability associated with a reduction in ergosterol that may also play a role in the improved phenotype. These findings support the development of C. maltosa and other potential microbial cell factories for plastic biorefineries and may inform future design strategies.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

However, PrPSc, now known to be a simple amyloid, can just template a previously unfolded polypeptide chain. Therefore, PrPSc can easily template the disordered 90-120 domain of an incoming PrPC molecule, but not its 121-231 folded domain (FD). The FD needs to accommodate into the 121-230 PrPSc surface, an inert procrustean bed. Thus, a mechanism for concerted unfolding/refolding of the FD must exist, with FD unfolding as a key element. To explore how this might happen, we performed thermal unfolding of recombinant bank vole PrPC(90-231), that is a universal PrPSc propagator, tracking changes at the residue level with solution NMR to pinpoint early unfolding propensity. Our data suggest that a key early event is the destabilization of the short {beta}1-{beta}2 assembly, and that the segment contiguous to the disordered tail, 121-140, encompassing {beta}1 and its adjacent coils, is the most likely region to unfold first. Spectroscopic data obtained at higher temperatures suggest that portions of alpha helix 2 are likely the last elements of the FD to unfold and refold into the PrPSc conformation. Molecular Dynamics simulations assisted the interpretation of these changes and suggest separation of 1 from the rest of the FD ensemble. Our data provide a conceivable timeline of the early events in PrPSc-assisted conversion of PrPC and should serve as a starting framework to develop a future atomistic model of PrPSc propagation.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

These cell-generated aggregates differ structurally and functionally from synthetic fibrils, exhibiting heightened seeding activity and the ability to cross-seed tau aggregation, a key driver of AD progression. Notably, A{beta}42 fibril formation in this system requires active cellular processes and is exacerbated by loss of TREM2, a major AD risk gene. Transcriptomic profiling reveals an early inflammatory response resembling microglial states observed in human AD models, positioning this system as a tractable, human-relevant platform to dissect the interplay between A{beta} ; aggregation, innate immunity, and genetic susceptibility.

TILs are manufactured by expanding and reinfusing tumor-reactive T cells from tumor biopsies. Efficacy of TIL therapies has been limited by the heterogeneity of expanded TIL products and the high prevalence of dysfunctional exhausted CD8+ T cells (TEX). While a subset of CD8+ TILs co-expressing CD103 and CD39 are enriched for tumor-reactive TILs across multiple cancer types, these cells are often in the TEX state with low proliferative potential. To identify regulators of human TIL proliferation, we screened an open reading frame library encoding for all human transcription factors (TFs). RELB emerged as the dominant driver of human TIL expansion with a skew towards CD8+ cells. TCR diversity was maintained after multiple days of in vitro expansion driven by RELB. Transcriptome profiling of multiple RELB-expressing TIL subtypes revealed a shift towards a memory/costimulatory-like phenotype. Using a HER2-targeting CAR and tumor co-culture model, RELB conferred improved persistence after multiple tumor challenges in vitro and improved solid tumor control in mouse xenografts in vivo.

Such properties can be probed by single-molecule FRET experiments, which have revealed a strong dependence of the equilibrium degree of compaction on sequence for a set of 16 naturally occurring disordered regions of the same length from RNA-binding proteins. Remarkably, however, we find chain reconfiguration times measured for the same proteins to be almost independent of sequence, although chain dynamics would be expected to be slower for more compact proteins because of stronger intrachain interactions leading to increased internal friction. We investigate this effect with the aid of multi-microsecond, all-atom explicit-solvent simulations of all 16 disordered proteins. The simulations reproduce the experimental FRET efficiencies across the sequence set with near-quantitative accuracy. Explicitly including the FRET dyes improves agreement while minimally perturbing the protein ensemble, with residual deviations arising mainly from slightly overstabilized salt bridges. The simulations further reproduce the experimentally observed lack of correlation between reconfiguration times and chain dimensions across sequences. We are able to rationalize this observation as arising from two compensating factors as the chains get more compact: The narrowing of end-to-end equilibrium distance distributions and a concomitant reduction of the effective end-to-end diffusion coefficients have opposite effects that result in the the small variation of reconfiguration times with protein collapse, helping to \"buffer\" the effect of sequence on linker dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we present bioinformatic and structural evidence that FphE may be involved in aromatic compound metabolism. In addition, twelve distinct crystal forms reveal that FphE exists as a highly unusual but stable and flexible, cross-subunit homodimer, unique to the large alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. Substrate engagement favors retention of the dimeric state, which is a more catalytically active form of the enzyme and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) confirms the dimeric architecture occurs in solution. High-resolution co-crystal structures of FphE covalently bound to two chemically distinct ligands reveal different modes of active site engagement, supporting an atypical structural plasticity of the dimer interface.

One of the key questions is whether antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are selected for at the low antibiotic concentrations typical for most environments. Many studies have observed changes in the relative abundance of ARGs from one environmental compartment to the next, e.g. from wastewater treatment plant influent to effluent. Fewer studies have directly tested for selection by incubating environmental samples in mesocosms or laboratory models at different concentrations of antibiotics to infer minimal selective concentrations. We developed a mathematical model to demonstrate that these studies can be confounded by shifts in the microbial community composition that occur when a microbiome is transported from one environmental compartment to another or when incubated under different conditions. Such community shifts will confound tests of selection when there is an association between carriage of ARGs and other functional traits. As an example, we show that there is a phylum-dependent association between the number of ARGs and the number of ribosomal RNA genes, which are both higher in fast growing, copiotrophic bacteria. We then show that specific growth rate or nutrient concentration upshifts increased the proportion of copiotrophs in the community and thus the relative abundance of ARGs. This result generalizes to community shifts for other reasons if there is some association between ARGs and ecological niches. Therefore, most studies of selection for ARGs in the environment are confounded. Solutions are proposed.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Such mirror bacteria could pose an unprecedented biosecurity risk, as they are predicted to be highly virulent pathogens resulting from severe immune evasion. Pharmaceutical interventions, including antibiotics and vaccines, could likely provide some limited protection in the event of a mirror bacterial outbreak. Understanding the feasibility of specific pharmaceutical antimirror strategies may help inform the appropriate measures to confront the risks of mirror bacteria. Here, we experimentally evaluated the prospects of previously proposed antimirror antibiotic and vaccine strategies. First, we assessed the expected efficacy of existing antibiotics chloramphenicol, linezolid, tedizolid, and aztreonam against mirror bacteria by characterizing the antibacterial activities of their enantiomers against natural-chirality bacteria. We found that ent-chloramphenicol, ent-linezolid, ent-tedizolid, and ent-aztreonam exhibited minimal antibiotic activity, suggesting that their parent antibiotics would be ineffective against mirror bacterial infections. Second, to explore whether the enantiomers of existing antibiotics could be suitable as antimirror antibiotics, we evaluated the acute toxicities of ent-chloramphenicol, ent-linezolid, ent-tedizolid, and ent-aztreonam in mice, finding that these compounds have favorable acute toxicity profiles compatible with their continued development. Finally, we investigated D-peptide-based approaches to antimirror vaccines, finding that three bacterially-derived D-peptides induced robust D-peptide-specific antibody responses in mice when conjugated to a carrier protein and adjuvanted. Our results support previous suggestions that the enantiomers of existing antibiotics and D-peptide conjugate vaccines represent feasible pharmaceutical strategies against mirror bacterial infections.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

By framing folding as an unfolded-to-folded sequence transformation using a novel structural tokenization, ProteusFold reduces regression complexity while preserving bond connectivity through the concept of \"Synapses.\" It achieves near-atomic fidelity (RMSD 0.24 [A], GDT-TS 99.85) and excels in protein-protein docking with a mean DockQ of 0.7675, with 95.5% of complexes above the 0.23 threshold. Compared to AlphaFold2's Predicted Aligned Error (6.28), ProteusFold attains 0.396, representing an order-of-magnitude gain in positional accuracy. Beyond accuracy and efficiency, the model provides residue-level attribution analyses that highlight biologically significant residues, serving as a preliminary guide for experiments. Furthermore, ProteusFold is the first to provide atomic-level attribution of key electronic and thermal properties, offering deeper insight into folding mechanisms and pinpointing the specific atoms responsible for distinct scenarios. Moreover, a meta-analysis suggests the presence of folding hotspots, where critical residues cluster, revealing new avenues for discovery.

To test the effectiveness of DNA metabarcoding to identify fish species and to capture seasonal variations in local ichthyofauna, monthly ichthyoplankton and 2 L water samples were collected over 13 months in the lower section of the Guadiana River Estuary in southeast Portugal. Both sample types underwent high-throughput sequencing for three genetic markers (COI, 12S, 16S), with morphological identification also performed for ichthyoplankton. Bulk and water samples identified a total of 131 fish species throughout the year. DNA metabarcoding demonstrated higher taxonomic resolution and diversity detection, with 115 species recovered, while morphology identified only 23 species. Ichthyoplankton metabarcoding also detected 40% more fish than water eDNA, recovering almost the double of species despite the fact that both approaches used the same metabarcoding primers. The integration of multiple molecular markers was crucial to maximize diversity detection in both DNA-based methods. In addition, DNA metabarcoding was able to identify ichthyofaunal spawning periods and captured significant seasonal variations in fish community, with higher diversity observed during the warmer months. With this strategy, around 66% of the historically recorded ichthyoplankton taxa in the region were identified, along with several new records.

In the presence of ADP, M5 bound to F-actin by both heads makes a forward step when the trailing head is detached by an external force. This forward step harnesses the strain energy in the leading (L) head, provided from the strong binding energy between the L-head and actin. Consequently, strain generation reduces the binding affinity, which manifests as sporadic, brief L-head detachment. Strain generation and brief L-head detachment also occur during ATP-dependent walking to similar extents as during ATP-free walking.

Moreover, Recombination Signal Binding Protein for Immunoglobulin Kappa J region (RBPJ), which is a transcription factor typically involved in the canonical Notch signaling process, dampened this epigenetic modification, enhanced apoptotic cell clearance, and suppressed inflammation by mouse atherosclerotic plaque, alveolar, peritoneal, and bone marrow-derived macrophages and human primary macrophages. Inhibition of the Notch signaling in macrophages significantly reduced efferocytosis whereas activation of this signaling augmented apoptotic debris clearance. Mechanistically, RBPJ upregulated Stard13 and Arsg by diminishing H3K9me3 on their promoters. Stard13 promoted efferocytosis by magnifying actin polymerization via inhibition and activation of Rho and RAC GTPases, respectively. Genetic and pharmacological inhibitions of SUV39H1/H2, the methyltransferases that are responsible for H3K9 trimethylation, amplified the expression of Stard13 and Arsg, and augmented efferocytosis by RBPJ-/- macrophages.

Xoo virulence depends on the ability to trigger SWEET sucrose efflux transporters in the xylem parenchyma (XP) by injection of transcription activation like effectors (TALe) into host cells, likely to access host-derived sucrose. To establish infection, Xoo must overcome physical barriers, immune responses and the hydraulic xylem flow. To gain insights into the colonization process, we used translational SWEET11a-GUS reporter lines, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy of Xoo tagged with a fluorescent protein. We found that Xoo can differentiate in vitro into filamentous forms. We mapped the infection route of Xoo along the vasculature, identified distinct spatiotemporal phases of Xoo colonization marked by rod-shaped and, notably, filamentous Xoo cells. Rod-shaped Xoo were found to attach to xylem pits during basipetal progression of the infection. Notably, we found that at later infection stages, Xoo could enter the XP. Strikingly, subsequently Xoo forms filament that can traverse bundle sheath cells and enter into the mesophyll. Chlorosis and necrosis of leaves is thus likely not just due to blockage of xylem flow, but to direct tissue damage. Filamentation had been reported as important for virulence of human pathogens e.g. Yersinia pestis, uropathogenic E. coli and Shigella and had been associated to sugar utilization in Bacillus subtilis.

Here, we established a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)-based approach for neuronal reprogramming of primary human astrocytes. We conducted high-throughput CRISPRa screens of all human genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) to identify novel and efficient reprogramming factors. scRNA-seq characterization of top hits revealed that single TFs reprogram primary human astrocytes into multiple neuronal subtypes with distinct cell type-specific gene signatures. We demonstrate that INSM1 reprograms astrocytes to a glutamatergic neuron-like state and has broad neurogenic activity across different cell types and across human and mouse contexts. Finally, we conduct paired CRISPRa screens to identify cofactors that cooperate with INSM1 to enhance neuronal reprogramming and subtype specification, and elucidate genomic mechanisms of interaction and downstream regulators.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

L.; Goodyear-Brown, S.; Fuhrmann, S.", "abstract": "Purpose: Multiple mouse lines using constitutive or inducible Cre recombinase expression have taken advantage of the early optic field expression of the Rax/Rx gene and its subsequent, progressive restriction to retinal progenitors, retinal pigmented epithelium and the optic stalk. Among these, the constitutive transgenic lines, Rx3-Cre and Rax-Cre BAC Tg, are currently used by vision researchers. Here we directly compare their prenatal ocular and extra-ocular Cre activities. Methods: Rx3-Cre or Rax-Cre BAC transgenic male mice were mated to the Cre-dependent lineage tracer Ai9/tdTomato. The resulting live and fixed tissue expression for each line was evaluated at multiple stages of development, from the optic vesicle stage onward. Both whole embryo and immunolabeled cryosectioned material were digitally imaged. Results: Rx3-Cre recapitulates endogenous RAX protein expression at the optic vesicle and optic cup stages, but there is also ectopic Cre activity in periocular mesenchyme (POM), within PITX2- and PECAM-1-expressing subpopulations. We also show that ectopic Cre activity can include germline expression. Besides a small ectopic domain in developing limbs, the Rax-Cre BAC mouse driver fully recapitulates endogenous RAX expression in the embryonic and postnatal eye. Conclusions: We provide a systematic analysis of two Rax-Cre drivers during embryonic and postnatal eye development that are very useful to recapitulate severe congenital eye diseases. Data presented here strongly support the inclusion of lineage reporting and evaluation of littermates lacking a Cre transgene, whenever conditional targeting strategies are used in studies of optic vesicle-derived tissues.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

While CLas-positive (CLas+) females exhibit increased fecundity and metabolic demands, their neuroendocrine regulation remains unclear. We propose CLas manipulates dopamine (DA) signaling to enhance psyllid fecundity and CLas proliferation. Metabolomics revealed elevated DA in CLas+ females. Silencing DA synthesis genes and receptor DcDop2 via RNAi reduced lipid reserves, fecundity, and ovarian CLas titers. Through combined in vivo and in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that the microRNA miR-31a suppresses DcDop2 expression by binding to its 3 untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-31a resulted in decreased DcDop2 expression and CLas titers in the ovaries, eliciting phenotypic defects akin to DcDop2 knockdown. Furthermore, DcDop2 knockdown and miR-31a overexpression reduced juvenile hormone (JH) levels and adipokinetic hormone (AKH) signaling in fat bodies and ovaries. Consequently, CLas hijacks the DA/DcDop2-miR-31a-AKH-JH signaling cascade to improve D. citri lipid metabolism and fecundity, while simultaneously promoting its replication. These findings suggest a mutualistic interaction between CLas proliferation and ovarian development within the insect host that enrich our understanding of the molecular interplay between plant pathogens and vector insects and offer novel targets and strategies for the field management of HLB.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we applied Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) to assess >23,000 amino acid substitutions across two TYK2 functions: IFN- signaling and protein abundance. This enabled high-resolution structure-function mapping and the identification of novel allosteric sites. By coupling DMS with inhibitor treatment, we uncovered variants that modulate compound potency. We also show that human variants - both common and rare - that are protective against autoimmune phenotypes reduce TYK2 protein abundance.

M.; Ahmad, I.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) aggregation, with soluble oligomers implicated as the most neurotoxic species. Recent evidence suggests microbial infections, including Helicobacter pylori, contribute to AD pathogenesis. This study investigates the role of H. pylori GroEL, a conserved chaperonin found in bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), in stabilizing toxic A{beta} oligomers. A pan-genome analysis of 353 H. pylori strains identified GroEL as a highly conserved protein present in 83% of strains, which supported its widespread relevance. We structurally modelled a conserved 27-amino acid GroEL fragment and docked it against the A{beta} (1-42) tetramer. Interaction analysis revealed stabilizing salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and extensive non-bonded contacts within the GroEL-A{beta} complex. Molecular dynamics simulations (50 ns) demonstrated that GroEL binding enhanced A{beta} oligomer stability, evidenced by reduced structural deviations and a more extensive hydrogen bonding network compared to A{beta} oligomer alone. These computational findings support a novel mechanism whereby H. pylori GroEL directly stabilizes soluble A{beta} oligomers. We hypothesize that this stabilization inhibits their aggregation into plaques while paradoxically prolonging the lifetime of neurotoxic species, potentially increasing neurodegeneration through pathways distinct from canonical amyloid deposition. This highlights the complex role of bacterial proteins in AD and underscores the need for experimental validation of GroEL-A{beta} interactions as a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

However, the full extent of TLR responsiveness for MZ B cells and the mechanisms regulating such responses are unclear. We report that Notch2 activation establishes MZ B cell responsiveness for the viral dsRNA receptor TLR3 and augments responses for the LPS receptor TLR4. Notch2 ligation accelerated Myc induction, mitosis, and plasma cell differentiation to LPS. Further, TLR3 expression in MZ B cells was Notch2 dependent, and ectopic Notch2 signaling was sufficient to promote robust TLR3 responsiveness dependent on the TIR-domain-containing adapter TRIF and the kinase BTK. TLR3 engagement in MZ B cells promoted proliferation, differentiation, and the secretion of IgG2b and IgG2c antibodies. Our results establish a novel role for Notch2 in establishing TLR3 and TLR4 responsiveness in B cells and suggest that MZ B cells play unappreciated roles in immunity against RNA viruses.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Mortality in severely malnourished children is often attributed to common infectious diseases, including enteric infections. It has been proposed that impaired intestinal barrier function contributes to mortality, but direct evidence is limited and thus there exists a need to develop improved preclinical models to test these and other mechanistic hypotheses. In this study, we aimed to describe differences in response to enteric inflammation and infection in the colon of malnourished mice compared to well-nourished littermates. C57Bl/6 male weanlings were fed isocaloric diets, either a low 1% protein diet (LPD) or a control 18% protein diet (CPD) for 2-weeks either in combination with oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), or <Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium)>. LPD-fed mice were more susceptible to DSS or <C. rodentium> as evidenced by increased clinical severity scores, and reaching their humane endpoints. LPD-fed mice also showed more signs of colonic dysfunction with reduced levels of tight junction proteins, higher colonic pathogen load, and increased systemic inflammation and bacterial spread. Taken together, these observations show that malnourished animals have increased susceptibility to intestinal dysfunction caused by either chemical exposure or infection. These novel preclinical models can be used to further elucidate the processes involved in enteric dysfunction in malnutrition and to test therapies to improve intestinal repair and outcomes.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Rationale: The impact of Th17 lymphocytes on epithelial responses to rhinovirus infection in asthma is poorly characterized. Methods: Bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) from children with asthma were differentiated to an organotypic epithelium and primed via co-culture with healthy donor Th17 lymphocytes for 4 days prior to apical infection with human rhinovirus-16 (RV-16). RNA sequencing with WGCNA analysis was performed to identify modules of gene expression altered by Th17 priming or RV-16 infection in BECs or Th17 cells. Gene expression was correlated with viral copy number and with secreted protein levels. Results: Analysis identified 4,030 genes grouped into 9 named modules with differential gene expression in BECs due to Th17 priming and viral infection. Modules with increased expression with Th17 priming and RV-16 infection included Interferon, MAP-kinase and TNF Signaling modules, while expression of Cilia structure/function and Metabolism modules were decreased. Th17 cells co-cultured with RV-16 infected BECs exhibited increased expression of an Interferon and Viral Response Module without detectable direct viral infection of Th17 cells. Increased expression of the Interferon Signaling in BECs and Interferon Response in Th17 cells was correlated with increased viral copy number in BECs. Th17 priming of BECs led to increased secretion of IFN-, IFN-{gamma}, and IL-1{beta} following RV-16 as compared to BECs alone. Conclusions: Th17 lymphocytes enhance epithelial interferon responses to RV-16 infection in bronchial epithelium from asthmatic children.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "As polarized cells divide, daughter cells must re-establish polarity at the correct site to maintain their shape. Fission yeast cells are bipolar, however growth initiates first at the old end of the cell that was inherited from the mother. This dominance of the old end is dependent on that end having grown in the previous generation, suggesting cells must be able to recognize when an end has a previous history of growth. We find that the proteins Rax1/2 act as markers for memory of growth by localizing to growing cell ends and remaining through division. Rax1/2 then promote activation of Ras1-GTPase at dividing cell ends by recruitment of its GEF Efc25. Localized Ras1 activity at the old ends ensures timely activation of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 to initiate polarized growth, providing an advantage to the old end. Through this work, we demonstrate the role of a Ras-GTPase in positioning the site of polarization and maintaining cell shape across multiple generations.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined patterns of sex-biased gene expression within and among 6 Drosophila species with divergence times ranging from 2-50 million years. We detected contrasting patterns of sex bias conservation and turnover between heads and bodies, with more extensive sex-biased expression and greater conservation of sex-biased expression in the body, but more species-specific turnover of sex-biased expression in the head, where conserved, unbiased expression was common. Interestingly, in both body parts lineage-specific gains of sex-biased expression occurred most often via concordant expression changes in both sexes that differed only in their magnitude, with this pattern being particularly strong in the head, suggesting that the majority of lineage-specific sex bias gains do not represent a resolution of sexual antagonism, but instead reflect regulatory changes shared between the sexes. We detected an enrichment of putatively positively selected expression changes among sex-biased genes in both body parts. Taken together, our findings suggest sex-biased changes may often be facilitated by selection acting on the sex with lower expression, especially for male expression of female-biased genes in the body. We also detected differences in the proportion of sex-biased genes located on the X chromosome depending on sex bias and body part. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the dynamics of sex-biased gene expression, as well as the molecular mechanisms and selective forces underlying its turnover, across short and long evolutionary timescales.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}

Higher plants encode an expanded family of PUF proteins with 26 members in Arabidopsis thaliana of which 6 (PUM1-PUM6) have a domain organization equivalent to metazoan PUF proteins implicated in mRNA regulation. Here, we show that the PUF proteins PUM2 and PUM6 are expressed in mitotically active cells of root and shoot meristems, while PUM5 is mostly expressed in the differentiation zone of root meristems exiting from active division. Increased PUM2 dosage in proliferating cells causes growth repression and developmental delay reminiscent of mutants with defects in cytoplasmic YTHDF proteins that bind to N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA. Remarkably, even weak defects in the m6A-YTHDF system enhance the effect of increased PUM2 dosage. In line with this genetic interaction, mRNA targets overlap significantly between PUFs and the major YTHDF proteins ECT2 and ECT3. Furthermore, the enrichment of the core PUF recognition motif URUAY around m6A sites is largely explained by PUF targeting, not by direct URUAY methylation as previously suggested. Our results indicate that the balance between the reciprocal activities of the deeply conserved cytoplasmic RNA binding protein families PUF and YTHDF is an important element of growth control in plants.", "date": "2025-10-12", "journal": ""}
