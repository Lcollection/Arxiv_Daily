Recent studies have demonstrated intergenerationally inherited changes in the olfactory system in response to fear conditioning, resulting in increases in olfactory sensory neuron frequencies and altered responses to odors. We investigated changes in the cellular composition of the olfactory epithelium in response to an aversive stimulus. Here, we achieve volumetric cellular resolution to demonstrate that olfactory fear conditioning increases the number of odor-encoding neurons in mice that experience odor-shock conditioning (F0), as well as their unconditioned offspring (F1). We demonstrate that the increase in F0 is due, in part, to the biasing of the stem cell layer of the main olfactory epithelium. Detailed analysis of F1 behavior revealed subtle odor-specific differences between the offspring of unconditioned and conditioned parents, despite the absence of an active aversion to the conditioned odor. Thus, we reveal intergenerational regulation of olfactory epithelium composition in response to olfactory fear conditioning, providing insight into the heritability of acquired phenotypes.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Photosynthesis transiently consumes inorganic phosphate (Pi). We therefore asked whether changes in intracellular Pi pools can act as a signal for reprogramming gene expression upon increased light intensity. The function of triose phosphate utilization for intracellular Pi homeostasis was deciphered by investigation of mutants defective in both photoassimilate partitioning and low-Pi signaling. Next, we determined subcellular Pi levels and transcript accumulation upon short-term high light. Physiological consequences were examined by analyses of ATP, carbohydrates, and an untargeted lipid profiling approach. The capacity for triose phosphate utilization clearly affected systemic Pi signaling. High-light treatment caused a rapid depletion specifically of chloroplast Pi levels paralleled by induction of transcripts dependent on PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) and PHR1-LIKE 1. Among the high-light induced targets of PHR1, SRG3/GDPD1 is involved in phospholipid catabolism. Lipid profiling revealed differences between WT and srg3 mutant plants upon high light, including changes in linolenic acid and photoprotective zeaxanthin. We conclude that photosynthetic activity regulates the low-Pi response machinery in the nucleus to implement high-light acclimation. This facilitates the liberation of cellular P as well as the maintenance of membrane lipid integrity.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

L.; Sanchez-Romero, R.; Mill, R. D.; Cole, M. W.", "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) has been invaluable for understanding the brain's communication network, with strong potential for enhanced FC approaches to yield additional insights. Unlike with the fMRI field-standard method of pairwise correlation, theory suggests that partial correlation can estimate FC without confounded and indirect connections. However, partial correlation FC can also display low repeat reliability, impairing the accuracy of individual estimates. We hypothesized that reliability would be increased by adding regularization, which can reduce overfitting to noise in regression-based approaches like partial correlation. We therefore tested several regularized alternatives -- graphical lasso, graphical ridge, and principal component regression -- against unregularized partial and pairwise correlation, applying them to empirical resting-state fMRI and simulated data. As hypothesized, regularization vastly improved reliability, quantified using between-session similarity and intraclass correlation. This enhanced reliability then granted substantially more accurate individual FC estimates when validated against structural connectivity (empirical data) and ground truth networks (simulations). Graphical lasso showed especially high accuracy among regularized approaches, seemingly by maintaining more valid underlying network structures. We additionally found graphical lasso to be robust to noise levels, data quantity, and subject motion -- common fMRI error sources. Lastly, we demonstrated that resting-state graphical lasso FC can effectively predict fMRI task activations and individual differences in behavior, further establishing its reliability, external validity, and ability to characterize task-related functionality. We recommend graphical lasso or similar regularized methods for calculating FC, as they can yield more valid estimates of unconfounded connectivity than field-standard pairwise correlation, while overcoming the poor reliability of unregularized partial correlation.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

While recent work has taken large steps towards solving this problem, the next question is how to assess the factors that influence co-occurrence. Here, I show that a recently proposed co-occurrence metric can be improved upon by assigning Bayesian priors to the latent co-occurrence relationships being estimated. In the context of analysing the factors that affect co-occurrence relationships, I demonstrate the need for a generalised linear model (GLM) that takes raw data (co-occurrences and species prevalence) not derived quantities (co-occurrence metrics) as its data. Next, I show the form that such a GLM should take in order to perform Bayesian inference while accounting for non-independence of dyadic matrix data (e.g. distance and co-occurrence matrices). I then present 3 example analyses to highlight the types of scientific questions these methods can help answer, using existing data sets - measuring the effects of trait dissimilarity among dung beetle species and relatedness between ant species on co-occurrence, and constructing co-occurrence networks of bacteria found in cystic fibrosis patient sputum samples.

This molecule has been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease marked by inflammation and demyelination in the CNS, as well as other neurological disorders. However, the effect of this molecule has not been studied on human myelinating cells. This study examines how fibrinogen influences human oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells at various stages of development. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) OL precursors and human primary OLs, we examined the effects of fibrinogen on cell differentiation, viability and myelination-related function. Here we show that fibrinogen induces an aberrant differentiation of early lineage OLs, by inhibiting their maturation and inducing an astrocytic phenotype, as seen in previous studies. On mature OLs, fibrinogen was found to promote myelination capacity as shown by ensheathment assays as well as on the RNA level. These effects were associated with the activation of BMP signalling, both in early and mature OLs. Transcriptomic analysis of human MS brain tissue shows similar pro-myelination changes in a subset of OLs, suggesting in vivo relevance. These findings indicate that fibrinogen has a lineage-dependent effect, where it may be inhibitory earlier in the lineage while promoting OL function in later stages. Understanding this dual role will provide insight into remyelination failure in MS and highlights the importance of timing and target in future therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Y.; Wen, A.; Chang, K.

While neurons are the main drivers of synaptic plasticity, glial cells are increasingly recognized for their roles as active modulators. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using Drosophila neuromuscular junction as a model system for a tripartite synapse, we show that peripheral glial cells collaborate with neurons at the NMJ to regulate activity-induced synaptic remodeling, in part through a protein called shriveled (Shv). Shv is an activator of integrin signaling previously shown to be released by neurons during intense stimulation at the fly NMJ to regulate activity-induced synaptic remodeling. We demonstrate that Shv is also present in peripheral glia, and glial Shv is both necessary and sufficient for synaptic remodeling. However, unlike neuronal Shv, glial Shv does not activate integrin signaling at the NMJ. Instead, it regulates synaptic plasticity in two ways: 1) maintaining the extracellular balance of neuronal Shv proteins to regulate integrin signaling, and 2) controlling ambient extracellular glutamate concentration to regulate postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance. Loss of glial cells showed the same phenotype as loss of Shv in glia. Together, these results reveal that neurons and glial cells homeostatically regulate extracellular Shv protein levels to control activity-induced synaptic remodeling. Additionally, peripheral glia maintains postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance and contribute to activity-induced synaptic remodeling by regulating ambient glutamate concentration at the fly NMJ.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Using 2D solid-state NMR of 13C labelled never-dried plants, six major glucose environments are resolved which are common to the cellulose of softwood, hardwood and grasses. These environments are maintained in isolated holo-cellulose nanofibrils, allowing more detailed microfibril characterisation. We show there are only two glucose environments that reside within the microfibril interior. These have the same NMR 13C chemical shifts as tunicate cellulose I{beta} centre and origin chains, with no cellulose I being detected. The third major glucose site with a carbon 4 chemical shift near 89 ppm, previously assigned to the crystalline microfibril interior, is now shown to be one of four surface glucose environments. The NMR peak widths of all four surface glucose environments are similar to those of the core indicating that their glucose local order is comparable; there is no significant amorphous cellulose in the microfibrils. Consequently, the ratio of the carbon 4 peaks at ~89 and ~84 ppm, which has often provided a sample cellulose crystallinity index, is not a meaningful measure of crystallinity or the interior to surface ratio. The revised ratio for poplar wood microfibrils is estimated to be 1:2, which is consistent with a ellulose I{beta} 18-chain microfibril having 6 core and 12 surface chains, although other microfibril sizes are possible.

While modern fish communities conserve trait space across similar habitats, little is known about trait-space variation through deep time or across different habitats. We examined how fish trait diversity varies through space and time by comparing three Late Devonian fish communities -- a tropical reef (Gogo, Australia), a tropical estuary (Miguasha, Canada), and a temperate freshwater system (Canowindra, Australia) -- with six modern communities from diverse habitats. Trait-space metrics reflecting within-community diversity (functional richness) and species similarity (functional nearest-neighbour distance) indicated Late Devonian communities had scores similar to modern communities. However, they were less functionally rich than their closest modern analogues, and their species tended to be more functionally distinct from one another. Metrics describing location in trait space (centroid distances and hypervolume overlap) showed modern communities were similar to each other, Gogo and Miguasha were similar but distinct from modern communities, and Canowindra was distinct from all others. This pattern suggests period-associated differentiation and substantial heterogeneity among some Late Devonian communities. In addition to temporal changes, we found consistent differences associated with habitat type and climate zone. Reef and tropical communities were the most functionally rich, whereas functional nearest-neighbour scores were highest in estuarine and temperate communities. These results indicate fish community trait space varies with time, habitat and climate, suggesting (i) lability in fish trait space and (ii) that evolutionary history, environmental filtering, and stochasticity influence community assembly.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Our Bayesian estimation of the Joppa model suggests a global diversity of the order of 30,000 species, suggesting that the 5,679 earthworm taxa already described only represent around 20% of the actual global species diversity. However, the uncertainty around this estimate is considerable due to severe undersampling and as the model cannot unambiguously decide whether we are describing few species because of a small pool of as yet unknown species, or because of a lack of taxonomic efficiency.

Under fluid flow, biofilms can form as streamers -- slender filaments tethered to solid surfaces and suspended in the flowing fluid. Streamers thrive in environments subjected to intense hydrodynamic stresses, such as medical devices and water filters, often resulting in catastrophic clogging. Their colonisation success may depend on a highly adaptable mechanical response to varying stress conditions, though the evidence and underlying mechanisms of this adaptation remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that biofilm streamers exhibit a stress-hardening behaviour, with both differential elastic modulus and effective viscosity increasing linearly with external stress. This stress-hardening is consistent across biofilms with different matrix compositions, formed by various bacterial species, and under diverse growth conditions. We further demonstrate that this mechanical response originates from the properties of extracellular DNA (eDNA) molecules, which constitute the structural backbone of the streamers. In addition, our results identify extracellular RNA (eRNA) as a modulator of the matrix network, contributing to both the structure and rheological properties of the eDNA backbone. Our findings reveal an instantaneous, purely physical mechanism enabling streamers to adapt to hydrodynamic stresses.

It involves a collection of symptoms that are typically associated with disrupted dopamine signaling and emerges during adolescence or early adulthood. Most schizophrenia-associated genes, however, involve glutamatergic or other ubiquitous targets that do not explain the latent expression of psychosis or dopaminergic abnormalities. Here, we describe an etiologically relevant model for the adolescent onset of dopamine-related dysfunction in schizophrenia. We focused on GRIN2A, the gene encoding the GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor, as both the common loss-of-function variants and the rare missense variants in this gene are risk factors for schizophrenia. We find that GluN2A levels distinctly decline in dopamine neuron-containing regions throughout adolescence while remaining stable in other regions. This suggested that adolescent dopamine neurons may be particularly vulnerable to further reductions in GluN2A caused by a damaging variant of GRIN2A. Consistent with this idea, we find that selective knockout of Grin2a in adolescent rat dopamine neurons results in a psychosis-relevant behavioral phenotype. This manipulation also reduced dopamine release in response to unexpected outcomes in young adults, reflective of prediction error signaling abnormalities observed in the clinical population. These data provide mechanistic insight into how GRIN2A mutations may contribute to the delayed onset of dopamine-related symptoms and provide a model for identifying course altering treatments for schizophrenia.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Our model is based on a feedforward chain of microcircuits that encode for the different sub-syllabic segments (SSSs) and that interact with each other through structured feedback inhibition. The network reproduced the in vivo activity patterns of each class of HVC neurons, and unveiled key intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms that govern the sequential propagation of neural activity by highlighting important roles for the T-type Ca2+ current, Ca2+- dependent K+ current, A-type K+ current, hyperpolarization activated inward current, as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. The result is a biophysically realistic model that suggests an improved characterization of the HVC network responsible for song production in the songbird.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

While significant progress has been made in managing the symptoms of 8p syndrome and other conditions caused by large-scale chromosomal aneuploidies, no therapeutic approach has yet been demonstrated to target the underlying disease-causing chromosome. Here, we establish a two-step approach to eliminate the abnormal copy of Chromosome 8 and restore euploidy in cells derived from an individual with a complex rearrangement of Chromosome 8p. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 361 differentially expressed genes between the proband and the euploid revertant, highlighting genes both within and outside the 8p region that may contribute to 8p syndrome pathology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proband exhibits a significant defect in neural differentiation that could be partially rescued by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of cell death. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using chromosome engineering to correct complex aneuploidies in vitro and establishes a platform to further dissect the pathophysiology of 8p syndrome and other conditions caused by chromosomal rearrangements.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Using a forward-prediction functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) model, we explored interactions between the hippocampus, VTA, and PFC in humans performing a novelty-imbued target-detection task. Hippocampal novelty activation predicted subsequent VTA target activation, enhancing readiness to detect goal-relevant information. Concurrently, goal-directed PFC activation modulated VTA target activation, refining focus on behaviorally significant cues. These circuits function both synergistically and independently, promoting subsequent hippocampal activity during target trials.

Here, we show that in an antibiotic-treated microbial community, bacterial spread is controlled by keystone engineering affecting dispersal--an effect hidden in well-mixed environments. Focusing on two pathogens, non-motile Klebsiella pneumoniae and motile Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we found that both tolerate a {beta}-lactam antibiotic, with Pseudomonas being more resilient and dominating in well-mixed cultures. During range expansion, however, the antibiotic inhibits Pseudomonas' ability to spread unless it is near Klebsiella-- Klebsiella degrades the antibiotic to create a \"clear zone\" that allows Pseudomonas to expand, at the expense of Klebsiella's own growth, thus acting as a keystone engineer. As Pseudomonas spreads, it competitively suppresses Klebsiella through resource competition. Our modeling and experimental analyses reveal that this keystone effect operates at a millimeter scale. We also observed similar keystone engineering by a Bacillus species isolated from a hospital sink, in both pairwise and eight-member bacterial communities with its co-isolates. These findings suggest that spatially explicit experiments are essential to understand certain keystone engineering mechanisms and have implications for surface-associated microbial communities like biofilms, as well as for diagnosing and treating polymicrobial infections involving drug-degrading, non-motile (e.g., Klebsiella), and drug-tolerant, motile (e.g., Pseudomonas) bacteria.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

We have recently shown that S lysine acetylation in the soluble monomer pool varies between healthy controls, PD, and MSA patients. To study the effects of lysine acetylation at all disease-relevant sites of S, we first compared production of acetylated S through either native chemical ligation or non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis. Since yields were comparable, ncAA mutagenesis was deemed superior for scanning many acetylation sites. We expressed and purified 12 disease-relevant variants and studied their binding to membranes as well as their aggregation propensities, and found that acetylation of lysine 12, 43, and 80 had particularly strong effects. To understand the implications for acetylation of monomeric S found in healthy cells, we performed NMR experiments to study protein conformation and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments to quantify lipid binding. We also investigated the effects of acetylation at lysine 12, 43, and 80 on fibril seeding in neurons. Collectively, our biochemical and cell biological investigations indicated that acetylation of K80 could inhibit aggregation without conferring negative effects on monomer function in healthy cells. Therefore, we studied the structures of fibrils with K80 acetylation through cryo-electron microscopy to uncover the structural basis for these effects. Finally, we identified inhibition of HDAC8 as a way of potentially increasing acetylation at K80 and other inhibitory sites for therapeutic benefit.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

The oscillations and coupling of IO neurons participating in the Upbound and Downbound modules determine at which frequency band PFs can be stabilized optimally.

We examined how the detection and color naming of small, short-duration increment stimuli ({lambda} = 543 or 680 nm) depend on the local spectral topography of the cone mosaic. Stimuli were corrected for optical aberrations by an adaptive optics system and targeted to locations in the parafovea where cone spectral types were known. We found that sensitivity to 680 nm light, normalized by sensitivity to 543 nm light, grew with the proportion of L cones at the stimulated locus, though intra- and intersubject variability was considerable. A similar trend was derived from a simple model of the achromatic (L+M) pathway suggesting that small spot detection mainly relies on a non-opponent mechanism. Most stimuli were called achromatic, with red and green responses becoming more common as stimulus intensity increased and as the local L/M ratio became more symmetric. The proximity of S cones to the stimulated region did not influence the likelihood of eliciting a chromatic percept. Our detection data confirm earlier reports that small spot psychophysics can reveal information about local cone topography, and our color naming findings suggest that chromatic sensitivity may improve when the L/M ratio approaches unity.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Whether this macroscale organization is specified in the genome or shaped by experience remains unresolved. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to compare functional connectome gradients and their coupling to structural measures in congenitally blind individuals and sighted controls. Both groups exhibited similar principal gradients: unimodal to transmodal (G1), somatosensory to visual (G2), and frontoparietal segregation (G3), suggesting that macroscale organization emerges independent of visual experience. However, blindness altered specific features of brain organization: the visual network was more segregated from the sensorimotor network (G2) and more integrated with transmodal (G1) and frontoparietal (G3) networks. Additionally, blind individuals showed disrupted hierarchy in the early visual cortex, reduced structure-function coupling in visual and temporal regions, and loss of functional differentiation within V1. These findings indicate that while large-scale cortical architecture emerges independently of vision, visual input plays a crucial role in refining it.

The reasons underlying these changes in parasite virulence are manifold. Here, we investigated the importance of order and timing of infection. We used a model of rodent coinfection between two parasites that do not compete for common resources, an intestinal nematode (Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Hp) and an apicomplexan protozoan (Plasmodium yoelii, Py). During single infections, Hp induced only mild disease symptoms. Plasmodium produced a substantial reduction in the number of red blood cells but all mice recovered from the infection. A different picture emerged in coinfected hosts. Hp maintained a profile of mostly asymptomatic infection when infecting hosts that had been previously infected with Py. On the contrary, Py incurred substantially higher costs in hosts that had been previously infected with Hp. We then investigated the possible reasons underlying the increase of Py virulence in hosts that had been previously infected with Hp. We found that coinfected hosts were less able to control Py multiplication and to recover from infection-induced anemia. Coinfected hosts had similar levels of erythropoietin and similar renewal of lost red blood cells compared to single Py infected hosts, resulting in decreased tolerance to Py infection. Experimental administration of erythropoietin in coinfected (Hp infecting first) hosts, partially decreased the severity of disease symptoms and improved tolerance. The detoxification of free heme released during the lysis of red blood cells, and the expression of Th1 and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes were also similar between coinfected and single infected hosts. However, coinfected mice had higher proportions of regulatory T cells expressing the CTLA-4 immune checkpoint, suggesting an enhanced immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. Py infection also induced the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, as coinfected mice had higher proportions of both PD-1+ and LAG-3+ CD8+ T cells, and an increase in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Overall, these results stress the importance of the order of infection as a major determinant of malaria severity in hosts harboring a gastrointestinal nematode infection.

Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term \"dressed invasion fitness\", which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Penguins are subject to strictly terrestrial phases, such as moulting, when metabolic heat production, insulation, and energetic constraints are heightened. We assessed thermoregulation in moulting captive king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) using simultaneous measurements of core and surface temperatures to test two hypotheses. Under the thermal challenge hypothesis, an initial rise in heat dissipation effort (i.e., increased peripheral vasomotion) followed by a rise in core temperature would indicate failure to prevent hyperthermia. Under the warm-up hypothesis, an initial rise of core temperature concomitant or followed by an increase of peripheral vasomotion would indicate regulated hyperthermia, possibly to accelerate feather development. Core and surface temperatures increased drastically but concomitantly during moult, providing tentative support for the warm-up hypothesis. Moulting penguins did not pant, suggesting that peripheral heat dissipation was sufficient to regulate moulting-induced hyperthermia. Core and subcutaneous temperatures in wild individuals resembled patterns measured in captivity, despite lower heat load and additional options for behavioural thermoregulation. These results indicate that hyperthermia is prevalent in moulting king penguins, and documenting the timing of temperature changes provides novel insights for the moulting physiology of penguins. Because moulting-induced hyperthermia may contribute to heat load, we caution that moulting may increase the susceptibility of wild penguins to heat stress, especially as regions near the poles warm at a disproportionately rapid rate.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

This research aimed to characterize in-depth a Priestia megaterium strain isolated from multimetal contaminated soils located at the Atacama Desert, showing potential for bacteria-assisted phytoremediation. Methods and Results: The strain MOD5IV exhibited notable PGPB features: phosphate and potassium solubilization, nitrogen fixation, phytohormone production, and growth promotion of Arabidopsis thaliana. Genomic analysis revealed a 5,254,635 bp chromosome plus nine plasmids, hosting over 6,000 genes. Functional annotation identified genes associated with resistance to copper, cadmium, lead, mercury, zinc, and cobalt. Also, genes linked to PGPB capabilities as siderophore-production, nutrient-solubilization, IAA-synthesis, and nitrogen-fixation.

Experimental Design: We analyzed electronic health records from 1,019 PLWH and 373,121 PLw/oH diagnosed with melanoma. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared. Spatial immune transcriptomics (72 immune-related genes) was performed on melanoma tumor samples (n=11), followed by downstream validation using multiplex immunofluorescence (n=15 PLWH, n=14 PLw/oH). Results: PLWH were diagnosed with melanoma at a younger age, had a higher representation of Hispanic and Black individuals compared to PLw/oH, and a decreased survival rate. PLWH also showed a markedly increased risk of brain metastases. PLWH experienced significant delays in initiating immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy and had worse survival outcomes following ICI, even after balancing for demographic covariates. Spatial transcriptomics revealed a more immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in PLWH, with upregulation of immune checkpoints (PD1, LAG3) and reduced expression of antigen presentation markers (HLA-DRB, B2M), with distinct spatial distributions in tumors and their microenvironments. Multiplex immunofluorescence confirmed an exhausted CD8 T cell compartment in PLWH, including enrichment of PD1intLAG3- and PD1intLAG3 subpopulations, and a significant accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (CD11b HLA-DR- CD33).

Methods: Eleven patients (chronic pain=5, major depressive disorder=5, obsessive-compulsive disorder=1) underwent inpatient testing using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) and symptom monitoring to identify personalized stimulation targets for subsequent DBS implantation. We present a structured approach to this sEEG testing, integrating a Stimulation Testing Decision Tree with power analysis and effect size considerations to inform adequately powered results to detect therapeutic stimulation sites with statistical rigor. Results: Effect sizes (Cohen's d) of stimulation-induced symptom score changes ranged from approximately -1.5 to +3.0. The standard deviation of sham trial responses was strongly correlated with the standard deviation of stimulation responses (r=0.86, p < 0.001). Power analysis (using a paired-t test) showed that, for large effect sizes (>=1.1), around 10 trials should be used per stimulation site. Furthermore, we show that 12-15 sham trials were needed to robustly estimate sham variability. Conclusions: The workflow presented is adaptable to any indication and is specifically designed to overcome key challenges experienced during stimulation site testing.

Simultaneous targeting of all three receptors may provide increased efficacy or overcome drug resistance due to tumor heterogeneity and cancer cell plasticity. LGR4/5/6 all bind to R-spondins (RSPOs) with high affinity and potentiate Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in response. Previously, we showed that a peptibody based on a mutant RSPO4 furin domain that bound to LGR4/5/6 without potentiating Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling was able to deliver cytotoxins into cancer cells that express any of the three receptors. We have now generated a mutant RSPO2 furin domain that retains high affinity binding to LGR4/5/6 without signaling activity. Peptibodies based on this RSPO2 furin mutant were conjugated with either pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer or camptothecin derivative, and the resulting peptibodydrug conjugates (PDCs) showed potent and specific cytotoxic activity in neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer cell lines expressing any of LGR4/5/6 in vitro and robust anti-tumor activity in vivo.

Membrane confinement grants cation-dependent control over receptor assembly and, when supplemented with hemin co-factors, their peroxidase DNAzyme activity. Cation-mediated control extends to receptor lateral distribution to localise DNA-based catalysis within phase-separated membranes domains of model synthetic cells, imitating the localisation of multimeric membrane complexes to signalling hubs in living cells.

L.", "abstract": "Under osmotic stress, bacteria express a heterotetrameric protein complex, KdpFABC, which functions as an ATP-dependent K+ pump to maintain intracellular potassium levels. The subunit KdpA belongs to the Superfamily of K+ Transporters and adopts a pseudo-tetrameric architecture with a membrane embedded selectivity filter as seen in K+ channels. KdpB belongs to the superfamily of P-type ATPases with a conserved binding site for ions within the membrane domain and three cytoplasmic domains that orchestrate ATP hydrolysis via an aspartyl phosphate intermediate. Previous work has hypothesized that K+ moves parallel to the membrane plane through a 40-[A] long tunnel that connects the selectivity filter of KdpA with a canonical binding site in KdpB. In the current work, we have reconstituted KdpFABC into lipid nanodiscs and used cryo-EM to image the wild-type pump under turnover conditions. We present a 2.1 [A] structure of the E1~P{middle dot}ADP conformation, which reveals new features of the conduction pathway. This map shows strong densities within the selectivity filter and at the canonical binding site, consistent with K+ bound at each of these sites in this conformation. Many water molecules occupy a vestibule and the proximal end of the tunnel, which becomes markedly hydrophobic and dewetted at the subunit interface. We go on to use ATPase and ion transport assays to assess effects of numerous mutations along this proposed conduction pathway. The results confirm that K+ ions pass through the tunnel and support the existence of a low affinity site in KdpB for releasing these ions to the cytoplasm. Taken together, these data shed new light on the unique partnership between a transmembrane channel and an ATP-driven pump in maintaining the large electrochemical K+ gradient essential for bacterial survival.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

M.; Chang, C. L. A.; Cornell, C. E.; Keller, S. L.", "abstract": "Micron-scale, liquid-liquid phase separation occurs in membranes of living cells, with physiological consequences. To discover which lipids might support phase separation in cell membranes and how lipids might partition between phases, miscibility phase diagrams have been mapped for model membranes. Typically, model membranes are composed of ternary mixtures of a lipid with a high melting temperature, a lipid with a low melting temperature, and cholesterol. Phospholipids in ternary mixtures are chosen primarily to favor stable membranes (phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins) or add charge (phosphatidylglycerols and phosphatidylserines). A major class of phospholipids missing from experimental ternary diagrams has been the phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). PE-lipids constitute up to 20 mol% of common biological membranes, where they influence protein function and facilitate membrane fusion. These biological effects are often attributed to PE's smaller headgroup, which leads to higher monolayer spontaneous curvatures and higher melting temperatures. Taken alone, the higher melting points of saturated PE-lipids imply that liquid-liquid phase separation should persist to higher temperatures in membranes containing PE-lipids. Here, we tested that hypothesis by substituting a saturated PE-lipid (DPPE) for its corresponding PC-lipid (DPPC) in two well-studied ternary membranes (DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol and DiphyPC/DPPC/cholesterol). We used fluorescence microscopy to map full ternary phase diagrams for giant vesicles over a range of temperatures. Surprisingly, we found no micron-scale, liquid-liquid phase separation in vesicles of the first mixture (DOPC/DPPE/cholesterol), and only a small region of liquid-liquid phase separation in the second mixture (DiphyPC/DPPE/cholesterol). Instead, coexisting solid and liquid phases were widespread, with the solid phase enriched in DPPE. An unusual feature of these ternary membranes is that solid and liquid-ordered phases can be distinguished by fluorescence microscopy, so tie-line directions can be estimated throughout the phase diagram, and transition temperatures to the 3-phase region (containing a liquid-disordered phase, a liquid-ordered phase, and a solid phase) can be accurately measured.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, we administered scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, to neurosurgical patients with intracranial electrodes as they performed an associative recognition memory task. When scopolamine was present at encoding, we observed disruptions to hippocampal slow theta oscillations (2-4 Hz), with selective impairments to recollection-based memory. However, when scopolamine was present during retrieval alone, we observed disruptions to slow theta without impaired memory performance. These disruptions included dose-dependent reductions in theta power, theta phase reset, and encoding-retrieval pattern reinstatement. Together, our results challenge the notion that theta oscillations are necessary for memory retrieval, and instead suggest that theta universally reflects an encoding-related neural state. These findings motivate updates to current models of acetylcholine's role in memory and may inform future therapies targeting rhythmic biomarkers of memory dysfunction.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Targeting these alternative metabolic programs in distinct molecular subtypes of aggressive prostate cancer may lead to new therapeutic approaches to combat treatment-resistance. We identify the poorly studied metabolic enzyme Oxoglutarate Dehydrogenase-Like (OGDHL), named for its structural similarity to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme Oxoglutarate Dehydrogenase (OGDH), as an unexpected regulator of tumor growth, treatment-induced lineage plasticity, and DNA Damage in prostate cancer. While OGDHL has been described as a tumor-suppressor in various cancers, we find that its loss impairs prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation. Loss of OGDHL profoundly alters Androgen Receptor inhibition-induced plasticity, including suppressing the neuroendocrine markers DLL3 and HES6, induces accumulation of the DNA damage response marker {gamma}H2AX, and reduces nucleotide synthesis. Our data suggest that OGDHL has minimal impact on TCA cycle activity, and that mitochondrial localization is not required for its regulation of prostate cancer plasticity and nucleotide metabolism.

For non-white researchers, this process involves complex negotiations that remain understudied, particularly among those stereotyped as \"model minorities.\" This qualitative study examines how Asian and Asian American early-career scientists navigate their racial and cultural identities within scientific writing and publication processes. Drawing on interviews with 23 participants who engaged with the Journal of Emerging Investigators, we identified two primary approaches to identity navigation: \"spurring,\" wherein racial and cultural backgrounds catalyze research questions and scientific inquiry, and \"siloing,\" wherein these identities are deliberately compartmentalized during formal scientific writing. Using an integrated theoretical framework combining cultural community wealth, narrative identity, and model minority discourse, we analyzed how participants strategically deployed cultural resources while navigating institutional expectations. Our findings reveal that while participants drew upon familial capital to inform research interests and occasionally acknowledged reflexivity, most also practiced disciplinary compartmentalization and adhered to perceived scientific norms of objectivity. This tension demonstrates how early-career scientists negotiate competing cultural scripts while developing professional identities. These findings have significant implications for science education, suggesting the need to help students recognize cultural backgrounds as valuable resources rather than sources of bias, address myths of pure objectivity, and provide models of successful identity integration in scientific work.

I present a comprehensive, open-source simulation framework--Array WAH--for designing, evaluating, and optimising microphone arrays tailored to bioacoustic tracking. The tool incorporates biologically realistic signal generation, frequency-dependent propagation, and advanced Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) localisation algorithms, enabling precise quantification of both positional and angular accuracy. The framework supports both frequency-modulated (FM) and constant-frequency (CF) call types, the latter characteristic of Hipposiderid and Rhinolophid bats, which are particularly prone to localisation errors due to their long-duration emissions. A key innovation is the integration of source motion modelling during call emission, which introduces Doppler-based time warping and phase shifts across microphones--an important and often overlooked source of error in source localisation. I systematically compare four array geometries--a planar square, a pyramid, a tetrahedron, and an octahedron--across a volumetric spatial grid. The tetrahedral and octahedral configurations demonstrate superior localisation robustness, while planar arrays exhibit limited angular resolution. My simulations reveal that spatial resolution is fundamentally constrained by array geometry and the signal structure, with typical localisation error ranging between 5-10 cm at 0.5 m arm lengths. By providing a flexible, extensible, and user-friendly simulation environment, Array WAH supports task-specific design and deployment of compact, field-deployable localisation systems.

However, there is lack of studies on exploring the mechanism of action of harpins. In this study, we report cloning of a novel harpin gene (HrpZ2) from Pseudomonas syringae strain MTCC-11950, belonging to harpin superfamily. In silico analysis revealed that about 50.29% of the protein consists of alpha-helices, 48.53% are random coils, and only 1.16% are beta-sheets, and nearly half (42%) of the protein consists of intrinsically disordered regions. Based on a prokaryotic predictive model and the presence of a signal peptide on its N-terminus, the subcellular localization of harpin is predicted as extracellular. Determination of protein sequence and structure are fundamental to understanding its biological function. To date, no experimentally determined crystal structure of any harpin protein is available. Using this information, we built and validated an ab initio model (with 99% of residues in allowed/additionally allowed regions and a Z-score of -5.3) of harpin. Phylogenetic analysis and functional domain studies revealed that this novel harpin belongs to the harpin superfamily. Infiltration of harpin in tobacco leaves resulted in hypersensitive response, which was associated with oxidative burst, callose deposition, localized cell death, and increased activity of defense-related enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase. Furthermore, infiltration of harpin in non-host plants from different angiosperm families induced hypersensitive response, indicating broad-spectrum agricultural applicability of this novel harpin protein.

This kind of correlation has been hypothesized to reflect a causal influence of sensory signals on decisions, a feedback influence of decisions on sensory signals, and various other factors as well. To disentangle these different possibilities, we have examined local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the middle temporal (MT) area of non-human primates performing a motion discrimination task. Compared to single-neuron spiking, LFPs have the advantage of being decomposable into different frequencies that are associated with different anatomical sources of input. More importantly, they persist when spiking activity is inactivated, which precludes a causal influence of the corresponding neural activity on behavior. We found that high frequency (70-150 Hz) LFP power was correlated with perceptual decisions and that this correlation disappeared when spikes were inactivated, consistent with a causal role for this frequency band in decision making. These signals overlapped in time with decision signals in lower gamma-band power (30-50 Hz), which persisted after spiking inactivation, suggesting a non-causal, feedback input.

Among them, newly defined peri-implantitis and high-grade periodontitis represent rapidly advancing inflammatory disease types, marked by relatively rapid tissue destruction. Despite their prevalence, the cell mechanisms and spatial architecture driving this severity remain poorly understood. Focusing first on peri-implantitis versus low- and moderate-grade periodontitis, we applied microbial profiling, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial proteomics (sp-proteomics) to uncover shared pathogenic programs linked to accelerated niche breakdown. Furthermore, to preserve spatial fidelity, each tissue was anatomically orientated along the tooth- or implant-epithelial interface, analogous sites of disease origination. Laser capture microdissection followed by microbiome analysis of unique tissue compartments revealed reduced bacterial load and diversity in peri-implantitis stroma. We then expanded our version-1 Human Periodontal Atlas by integrating newly generated peri-implantitis scRNAseq data (36-total samples; 121395-cells), revealing widespread transcriptional alterations, including oxidative stress, hypoxic, and NAD+ metabolism-associated signatures, primarily in a subpopulation of TNFRSF6B+/ICAM1+ post-capillary venules. We then performed high-resolution sp-proteomics (15-total samples; 337260-cells) and analyzed VEC states and associated neighborhoods via AstroSuite using newly developed tri-wise spatial analysis. This revealed CD34+-VEC loss and CD38+-VEC expansion almost exclusively in peri-implantitis. We extended this analysis to high-grade periodontitis. Mucosal biopsies from four lesion-affected and four unaffected sites within the same individuals (1:1 matched; 8 samples; 225137-cells) again demonstrated spatially restricted CD38+-VEC remodeling exclusively in affected tissues, with similar vasculopathy front patterning. The findings nominate spatially distinct vasculopathy patterning as a hallmark of rapidly advancing oral inflammation and a targetable therapeutic axis.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

In this study we employed an approach combining RNA splicing analysis to define RNA binding protein (RBP) motif enrichment around alternatively spliced exons in primary osteocytes cultured in high glucose conditions (HG). We identified the RBP human antigen R (HuR) as a top candidate regulator of AS. Loss of HuR reshaped the transcriptome through widespread changes in gene expression and splicing, converging on two major pathways: stress response and translational control. Functional validation of splicing revealed that HuR depletion heightened oxidative stress sensitivity and compromised cell viability under HG by stabilizing and upregulating TXNIP, a thioredoxin inhibitor. HuR knockdown also impaired mitochondrial mass and function and disrupted key translational signals, despite preserving global protein output.

Two industry groups launched nationwide surveys to document colony losses between June 2024 and March 2025 across all scales of beekeeping. This study analyzes these survey data to assess colony losses, estimate financial impacts, and identify correlations with beekeeper management practices and geographical locations. Unlike past surveys, commercial beekeepers experienced more severe losses than smaller-scale beekeepers during this period. Respondents, managing over half of U.S. colonies, most frequently cited Varroa mites as the cause for their losses. Varroa mites were followed by pesticides and pathogens in the case of commercial beekeepers and by queen failure and weather in the case of smaller-scale beekeepers. Although Varroa was the most frequently cited cause, losses did not significantly differ between users and non-users of amitraz, suggesting that rising amitraz resistance alone does not explain observed trends. Differences in protein and carbohydrate feeding frequencies also played a role in net losses. While colony loss rates and financial concern varied widely among respondents, commercial beekeepers understandably showed higher sensitivity to financial impacts, with concerns increasing linearly with loss severity. This study highlights the value of beekeeper surveys which, alongside direct analyses of bee samples and longitudinal studies, help identify effective management strategies and environmental risks. Such insights are crucial for addressing the leading causes of colony losses on a national scale, and ultimately aid in safeguarding honey bee health, pollination services, and agricultural production.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

We show that functional connectivity gradients arising from network activity closely match the geometric eigenmodes of the network's spatial embedding when neurons are locally connected. By systematically varying network parameters such as the connectivity radius and the prevalence of long-range connections introduced via edge swaps, we reveal a robust geometry-function correspondence that progressively deteriorates as local connectivity is disrupted. Additionally, we demonstrate that spatial filtering can artificially imprint geometric patterns on functional gradients. To support our computational results, we conduct volumetric calcium imaging experiments at cellular resolution in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae, uncovering functional gradients that closely align with geometric eigenmodes. Furthermore, the eigenmode-gradient mapping exhibits a cutoff at a spatial wavelength that precisely reflects the size of neuronal arborizations measured from single-neuron reconstructions, as predicted by our simulations.

HD is fatal and arises from a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in decreased neuronal health followed by brain atrophy, with spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the striatum being especially vulnerable to degeneration. HTT loss-of-function, caused by haploinsufficiency of the wild type HTT gene (wtHTT), is an important feature of HD pathophysiology that has previously been understudied compared to mutant HTT gain-of-function mechanisms. wtHTT is essential for nervous system development and functions as a scaffolding protein to support many vital cellular functions including axonal transport, autophagy and synaptic plasticity. Here, we examined the consequences of wtHTT deletion in the adult striatum by conditionally inactivating wtHTT in 2-4 month old male and female Httfl/fl mice. wtHTT loss of function in mature SPNs decreased intrinsic neuronal excitability and produced a neuroinflammatory response in these mice, while tissue organization, spine morphology and motor behaviour remained unaffected. Results presented here provide additional evidence that wtHTT is vital for maintaining neuronal health in the adult brain and highlight some potential adverse consequences of non-selective HTT-lowering for the treatment of HD.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Although traditionally associated with mild febrile illness, the recent geographic expansion and surge in OROV outbreaks have prompted attention to its neurotropic potential. Here, we investigated the impact of OROV infection on human neural development using neural stem cells (NSCs) and brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Recent OROV isolates exhibiting genomic reassortment and associated with increased neurological manifestations were compared with a prototypical strain for the ability to infect NSCs, early-stage organoids, and more mature cortical-like tissues. OROV infected NSCs efficiently, leading to widespread cell death, depletion of proliferative progenitors, and disruption of neuroepithelial organization. Transcriptomic profiling of infected NSCs revealed a robust reduction of antiviral response genes and an enrichment of pathways related to viral replication, apoptosis, and the inhibition of stem cell maintenance and neuronal differentiation. These molecular signatures aligned with the phenotypic collapse of progenitor pools and cortical structure observed in organoids. OROV antigens were detected in both astrocytes and neurons, with associated structural degeneration. Although a substantial overlap in differentially expressed genes was observed between the two viral strains, some strain-specific transcriptional responses were detected. However, these modest differences did not translate into distinct cytopathogenic effects between the two viral strains. These phenotypes, including the reduced growth of infected organoids, resemble those previously described with Zika virus in the same cellular models, supporting the hypothesis that OROV may impair brain development. Together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized neuroteratogenic potential of OROV strains and provide mechanistic insight into the potential of OROV to induce microcephaly-like phenotypes, highlighting its relevance as a significant threat to maternal-fetal health.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "After invading host cells and accessing the cytoplasm, many Rickettsia species undergo actin-based motility driven by two bacterial proteins, RickA and Sca2. In the spotted fever group species R. parkeri, this motility occurs in temporally and mechanistically distinct phases. Early in infection, RickA drives motility by activating the host Arp2/3 complex to nucleate actin; later, Sca2 independently drives motility by directly nucleating and elongating actin via a formin-like mechanism. The distantly related and non-pathogenic species R. bellii also expresses RickA and Sca2 orthologs, but how each contributes to the mechanism and timing of motility remains unclear. R. bellii Sca2 differs substantially from R. parkeri Sca2 in primary sequence, and we found that the R. bellii protein nucleates and elongates actin using an unusual N-terminal actin monomer-binding domain yet does not processively associate with growing actin filaments like R. parkeri Sca2 or eukaryotic formins. Notably, actin-based motility in R. bellii occurs only later in infection and strongly correlates with a highly polarized localization of Sca2 at one bacterial pole. In contrast, R. bellii motility is independent of RickA localization and Arp2/3 complex function. Compared to R. parkeri, R. bellii moves more slowly and along less direct paths, with actin tails exhibiting a distinct organization that reflects differences in Sca2 mechanism and localization. Together, these findings demonstrate substantial evolutionary flexibility in actin-based motility mechanisms within the Rickettsia genus and suggest similar adaptability among other intracellular microbes.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

In this work, we show that one can use world models of biology or other prior knowledge as approximate oracles over biological knowledge to utilize as soft verification to train reasoning systems without the need for additional experimental data. We introduce rbio-1, a reasoning model for biology that is post-trained from a pretrained LLM using reinforcement learning and uses learned models of biology to obtain biological knowledge for verification during training. We show that soft verification successfully distills biology world models into rbio, at the example of achieving leading performance on perturbation prediction against the PerturbQA benchmark compared to state-of-the-art models; we demonstrate the benefits of compositions of verifiers to learn more general rbio models.

How neural systems achieve such precision remains unclear. Here, we investigate how the housefly (Musca domestica), renowned for agile aerial manoeuvres, maintains visual accuracy during ultrafast motion. Although rapid movements typically blur vision, houseflies exhibit remarkable visual acuity; their visual neurons achieve record-high rates of information sampling (~2,500 bits/s) and synaptic transmission (~4,100 bits/s), substantially surpassing previous estimates. Using intracellular and photomechanical recordings of photoreceptors exposed to rapid sequences of saccade-like stimuli, we traced information transmission to large monopolar cells (LMCs), the first interneurons in the visual pathway. We identify a previously unknown mechanism - synaptic high-frequency jumping - in which photoreceptor-LMC synapses dynamically shift transmission towards higher frequencies during saccadic input. This mechanism extends visual bandwidth to ~920 Hz, eliminates synaptic delays, and quadruples traditional flicker-fusion limits (~230 Hz). Ultrafast behavioural experiments confirm flies respond synchronously within ~13-20 ms, even while photoreceptor responses are still approaching their peak (9-16 ms), directly challenging classical sequential-processing models. Our biophysically realistic photoreceptor-LMC model demonstrates how photomechanical, quantal, and refractory sampling processes co-adapt dynamically with behaviour. Thus, flies actively shape their visual input through self-generated saccades, driving high-frequency jumping, efficient neural coding, hyperacute vision, and neural synchronisation.

Despite these well-established roles, the temporal dynamics, region-specific functions, and downstream consequences of Shh signaling during retinal development remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of Shh signaling across multiple stages of retinal development using temporally and spatially controlled deletion of Smoothened (Smo), an essential transducer of the pathway. This approach reveals previously unrecognized requirements for Shh signaling in specifying optic nerve head identity and maintaining nasal-temporal polarity. We also show that Shh signaling coordinates neurogenesis by sustaining the retinal progenitor pool while also regulating progenitor competence, ensuring appropriate proportions of retinal cell types. Our data indicate that both proliferative capacity and the timing of cell fate specification are shaped by Shh pathway activity.

Sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, an often seen practice, does not include the history of individuals and hence may result in inconsistencies, which may lead to misinterpretations. Here, we introduce a novel model for inferring gene copy number evolution, which describes gene duplication and their evolution over time through a random walk on a coalescent duplication network. This approach is solely based on copy number counts and hence independent of the inconsistencies of sequence based inferences. Backward in time we implement structured coalescent simulations, where we re-interprete 'structure' as 'genealogical distance' based on copy number counts. We apply this model to the NB-ARC domain counts of NLR genes in A. thaliana to infer the number and times of duplication events that have led to the present day copy number distribution.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

E.; Abel, T.", "abstract": "The complement system is a major component of the innate immune system and plays an important role in immune surveillance. Recent research has demonstrated that the complement system also plays pivotal roles in brain development, and dysregulation of complement is involved in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms by which the complement system contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) remain poorly understood. In this study, we find that the expression of a central regulator of the complement cascade, complement component 3 (C3), is upregulated in the striatum of mice modeling the 16p11.2 hemideletion (16p11.2 del). 16p11.2 del is among the most common copy number variations associated with NDDs including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID). Pharmacological inhibition of the C3a receptor alleviates hyperactivity in 16p11.2 del mice, suggesting that elevated complement contributes to NDD-relevant behavioral changes. Due to the pro-inflammatory actions of the C3a receptor, we assess the cytokine environment in the striatum, a key neural substrate for locomotor behavior, and find that several inflammatory factors are upregulated in 16p11.2 del mice. Collectively, these results indicate that increased expression of the complement system, especially C3, mediates hyperactive behavior and is associated with a pro-inflammatory environment in the striatum of 16p11.2 del mice. Our results suggest that inhibition of an overactive complement system may be an effective strategy to ameliorate NDD symptoms resulting from 16p11.2 hemideletion including those associated with ADHD.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Phase-targeted closed-loop stimulation could provide a more precise and effective method to modulate these oscillations, particularly if stimulation parameters could harness the dynamics of the specific circuit mechanisms underpinning the generation of these activities. To address this question, we defined the response of theta- and gamma-frequency oscillations in the motor cortex to closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons transfected with Channelrhodopsin-2 in awake, head-fixed RBP4-Cre (retinol-binding-protein-4) and PV-Cre (parvalbumin) mice, respectively. Phase-targeted blue-light pulses were delivered using the OscillTrack algorithm to track theta phase in the cortical LFP in real time and trigger stimulation at one of four target theta phases. Stimulation was delivered over a quarter of the target theta cycle, either as a single continuous pulse (continuous protocol) or three short pulses at gamma (75Hz) frequency (gamma protocol). Stimulation of both neuron types, using either stimulation protocol, modulated theta power in a phase-dependent manner, with continuous stimulation of excitatory cells leading to stronger modulation. Phase-dependent amplification during stimulation of excitatory vs inhibitory neurons was offset by 90{degrees}, in line with predictions from computational models. Open-loop replay of previously recorded closed-loop stimulation patterns did not elicit the same phase-specific effects, demonstrating the necessity of the closed-loop interaction to produce these effects. Stimulation of pyramidal neurons using the gamma protocol amplified gamma power, independently of target theta phase. These findings reveal phase-dependent amplification of cortical theta power can be induced by stimulation of local excitatory or inhibitory neurons, with a phase-offset likely resulting from circuit interactions. This approach can be used to inform the development of brain stimulation methods to modulate these activities more effectively in humans.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

A common phenotype in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is defects in sensory processing, but whether these defects impair flexible sensory encoding is largely unexplored. In particular, how genetic risk factors such as Shank3 deletion affect the adaptability of cortical taste processing and downstream behavior is unknown. To address this gap, we performed two-photon calcium imaging during a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) learning paradigm, an ethologically relevant form of associative learning that depends on taste processing in the anterior insular cortex (AIC), to examine how Shank3 knockout alters taste-related neuronal activity in AIC and influences CTA learning. We found that AIC neurons in Shank3 knockout mice exhibited reduced stimulus-evoked suppression and increased trial-to-trial correlated variability during the acquisition of CTA memory. These activity changes, which likely reduced signal-to-noise ratio in AIC, were associated with slower CTA acquisition in knockout mice. In both genotypes, CTA learning enhanced, while subsequent extinction reduced, taste discriminability in AIC, and both extinction and the associated reduction in discriminability were faster in knockout than in wild-type mice. Together, these results show that Shank3 loss is associated with destabilized cortical activity dynamics in AIC, which may contribute to inefficient encoding and maintenance of learned taste aversion. These findings show that loss of Shank3 compromises the ability of animals to update behavior to incorporate negative outcomes, and suggest this loss of flexibility may be an important feature of monogenic ASDs.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Moreover, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of oncolytic peptides remains poorly understood. To address these challenges, we designed a series of peptides based on the previously reported oncolytic peptide CKS1 and evaluated their activity to induce cancer cell death. By comparing the structures and the activities of these peptides, we discovered novel insights in the SAR of oncolytic peptides. Among the peptides, we identified NF27 as the most potent peptide. NF27 showed broad cytotoxicity across multiple cancer types but displayed minimal toxicity against healthy cells and low hemolysis. Cell death induced by NF27 was immunogenic and promoted infiltration of immune cells in murine tumors. In murine tumor models, NF27 effectively suppressed tumor growth and achieved complete eradication in some cases, with no observable side effects.

L.", "abstract": "In synucleinopathies, the protein -synuclein misfolds into Lewy bodies (LBs) in patients with Lewy body disease (LBD) or into glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). The ability of a single misfolded protein to cause disparate diseases is explained by the prion strain hypothesis, which argues that protein conformation is a major determinant of disease. While structural, biochemical, and biological studies show that LBD and MSA patient samples contain distinct -synuclein strains, we recently reported the unexpected finding of a novel -synuclein strain in a Parkinson's disease with dementia patient sample containing GCI-like co-pathology along with widespread LB pathology. This finding led us to question if two -synuclein strains can interact with one another in a patient and, if so, can strain competition occur. Notably, this would not only impact the clinical presentation of disease but would also have profound impacts on successful therapeutic development. To test this possibility, we used the strain interference superinfection model developed in the prion field, in which a slower replicating strain--in this study, mouse-passaged MSA--is used to compete with a faster replicating strain--here, recombinant preformed fibrils (PFFs)--following sciatic nerve (sc.n.) inoculation. Unexpectedly, we found that PFFs generated using the same method differed in their ability to neuroinvade following sc.n. inoculation based on -synuclein monomer source. Using a PFF preparation that does spread from the periphery, we conducted strain competition studies by first injecting TgM83+/- mice with mouse-passaged MSA into the sc.n. followed by a second injection with PFFs at 30, 45, and 60% of the MSA incubation period. Unlike in the prion field, where the faster replicating strain inhibits the slower strain at the 30 and 45% time points, we found that the two -synuclein strains exhibited a synergistic effect during neuroinvasion. Notably, disease onset across the three cohorts was shortened compared to MSA inoculation alone, and brains from terminal animals showed evidence of both the PFF and mouse-passaged MSA strains, suggesting the two strains worked together to accelerate neuroinvasion in the mice. These findings have important implications for disease progression in patients with -synuclein co-pathologies. The finding that two strains can synergize with one another to accelerate the progression of clinical disease represents a novel outcome in mixed infection studies and more broadly expands our understanding of the effect of prion strain biology on disease pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Despite its central role, its activation mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we model how phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure during apoptosis triggers ADAM10 activation. We confirmed that PS externalization leads to shedding of CD43 from the surface of T cells via ADAM10 activity. Intriguingly, ADAM10 activation correlated with a loss of monoclonal ADAM10 antibody binding, suggesting a PS-induced conformational change that alters epitope accessibility. To explore this lipid-mediated conformational change of ADAM10, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to map the conformational landscape of ADAM10. Our simulations revealed that in the absence of PS, ADAM10 samples predominantly closed and intermediate states. By contrast, the presence of PS destabilizes the closed conformation, thereby favoring open states. We provide a mechanistic explanation for this PS-induced conformational change which drives ADAM10 activation and loss of mAb binding through conformational change. These findings offer new insights into the lipid-mediated regulation of ADAM10 and its conformational dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Most notably, this protein is deregulated in various cancer types and neurodegenerative diseases. In our previous work, the disorder nature of DPF3a, as well as its propensity to aggregate into amyloid fibrils, have been highlighted, making it an amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). Due to their high chain accessibility, IDPs structure and function are modulated by phosphorylation. It has been reported that phosphorylation of DPF3a at S348 (pS348) by the casein kinase 2 (CK2) is implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. CK2 can also phosphorylate DPF3a at S138 (pS138), which is also located in an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). However, no structural information is available on phosphorylated DPF3a. In the present study, we investigated the effect of phosphorylation on DPF3a structural and aggregation properties. Two single-mutated phosphomimetics (S138E and S348E) were characterised in vitro and compared to DPF3a WT, while in silico analyses were performed on pS138 and pS348 to assess structural changes at the molecular level. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that both phosphomimetics are hybrid IDPs, with increased turn and antiparallel {beta}-sheet content as well as more buried aromatic residues compared to DPF3a WT, suggesting conformational rearrangements and a more folded N-terminal region. In silico characterisation supported these results, showing that phosphorylation of S138 and S348 induce extended conformation, especially the C-terminal extremity, due to electrostatic repulsion, while local folding occurs due to a proximity with arginine and lysine residues. Furthermore, spectroscopic and microscopic analyses unveiled that S138E and S348E exhibit slower fibrillation kinetics compared to DPF3a WT involving distinct aggregation mechanisms.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

To answer these questions, we crossed middle-aged and old Eln+/-mice with 3xTg-AD mice. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin labeling MRI at rest and during hypercapnia to calculate cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). We also assessed neuroinflammation by microglia and astrocyte cell counts. We found that Eln+/- mice had lower resting blood flow rate in the cerebral cortex compared with Eln+/+ mice, but Eln+/- mice had an intact hypercapnic response, resulting in better CVR compared with Eln+/+ in hippocampus. Sex did not impact resting blood flow or CVR. 3xTg-AD mice had a lower resting CBF than non-AD mice, and there was an interaction between Eln genotype and AD mutations on CVR, such that Eln+/-x 3xTg-AD mice had the poorest hippocampal CVR of all groups. Glia cell counts were highly dependent on brain region, with Eln+/- having more microglia but fewer astrocytes, while 3xTg-AD having higher both microglia and astrocytes.

Social insects, in particular, use olfactory cues to maintain colony cohesion (Lenoir et al., 1999; Leonhardt et al., 2016). They recognize nestmates through colony-specific olfactory labels that individuals store as neural templates in their memory (Sherman et al., 1997). Learning continuously optimises the nestmate recognition template to keep up with the constant changes in colony labels (d'Ettorre and Lenoir, 2010; Errard and Hefetz, 1997; Wilgenburg et al., 2012). The template is often considered to be located in higher brain centres and potentially a product of learning (Bey et al., 2025; Brandstaetter et al., 2011; Esponda and Gordon, 2015; van Zweden and d'Ettorre, 2010). However, some authors suggest it might be in the neural periphery, i.e. the antennae or antennal lobes, formed by habituation or receptor adaptation (Guerrieri et al., 2009; Ozaki and Hefetz, 2014; Stroeymeyt et al., 2010). Here we investigate a potential mechanism for the construction and functioning of the colony template in the peripheral nervous system: the antenna's odorant receptor (OR) profile and its dynamics. We exposed Acromyrmex echinatior leaf-cutting ants to non-nestmate odours and analysed the consequences on their behaviour and antennal gene expression. Consistent with other studies, prolonged exposure to non-nestmate odours reduced worker aggression towards the non-nestmate label, indicating habituation to the non-nestmate odour (Carlin and Hoelldobler, 1983; Errard and Hefetz, 1997; Stroeymeyt et al., 2010). Exposure also altered the expression of the OR genes. Notably, the OR profiles were colony-specific, mirroring the colony-specific recognition labels. When we exposed two different colonies to the same non-nestmate odour, the colony-specificity of the odorant receptor gene expression vanished. This indicates that the olfactory machinery used to perceive nestmate recognition cues is flexible and adapts to the current nest-specific olfactory environment. The OR profiles could either become more sensitive to the nestmate recognition cues by increasing the number or ORs for the nest-specific substances, or less sensitive by decreasing the expression of these ORs. The latter would in turn increase the sensitivity to non-nestmate cues. This would be a mechanism explaining habituation to nestmate recognition cues that has been described across the social insect literature.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we examined the role of Nanos, an RNA-binding protein known to promote mRNA degradation, in blastoderm-stage PGCs.

In the genomes of ants, the odorant receptor (OR) gene family is dramatically expanded compared to other insects. This is most notable in the \"9-exon\" OR subfamily, which was implicated in responding to cuticular hydrocarbons, a major class of signalling compounds. The compilation of a large, high-quality ant genome dataset by the Global Ant Genomics Alliance allows investigating ant OR evolution in unprecedented detail. By analysing 55,068 ORs of 163 representative ant species, we tested for association between the development of sociobiological traits and adaptive evolution of ORs. We provide a detailed analysis of gene family expansions and adaptive sequence evolution at the OR subfamily level, allowing focused analysis of distinct ant lineages. We identified strong enrichment of positive selection on 9-exon ORs in the ancestor of the formicoid clade, the largest clade comprising 90% of the extant ants. Formicoid species are characterized by greater colony size and reproductive division of labour. Thus, our results support a key role of adaptive diversification of chemical communication systems for the evolution of more complex elaboration of social organization in ants. We also observed enrichment of positive selection on 9-exon ORs associated with the more recent evolution of continuous worker polymorphism in multiple lineages. Surprisingly, the recent evolution of other sociobiological traits was associated with depletion of positive selection on ORs. These results suggest that the evolution of worker polymorphism involves more extensive adaptation of chemical communication compared to other aspects of ant sociobiology. Our analysis of an unprecedented ant OR dataset offers new insights into the specific context in which ORs played a major role in the evolution of elaborations in social traits across the diverse phylogeny of ants.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

However, PLMs require substantial computational resources for both training and generating an embedding for a new sequence, which poses significant challenges for downstream tasks involving protein sequences. To address these challenges, we propose ProtSEC (Protein Sequence Embedding in Complex Space) that begins by mapping each amino acid to a unique complex number derived from the BLOSUM62 matrix to capture evolutionary information. Subsequently, a protein sequence is treated as a complex signal, and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to generate an embedding in complex space. Unlike PLMs, ProtSEC does not require training on a large-scale protein sequence dataset and subsequently showed a 20,000-fold increase in run time and an 85-fold memory efficiency compared to popular PLMs such as esm2_3B, esm2_35M, prot_t5, and prot_bert. ProtSEC showed 4% higher accuracy in sequence similarity search and improved accuracy in phylogenetic tree reconstruction compared to PLMs. ProSEC offers fast and accurate protein sequence embeddings in complex numbers, enabling efficient integration into downstream bioinformatics analyses.

K.", "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization in drug discovery faces a fundamental limitation: the assumption that all relevant optimization criteria can be predefined. Traditional approaches using fixed objective sets often miss critical molecular trade-offs that emerge during the optimization process. We present AMODO-EO (Adaptive Multi-Objective Drug Optimization with Emergent Objectives), a novel framework that systematically discovers, validates, and integrates new optimization criteria by analyzing chemical data patterns during the search process. Building upon established automated feature engineering principles, AMODO-EO extends these techniques to dynamic multi-objective optimization contexts in drug discovery. The framework automatically generates candidate objectives from molecular descriptor relationships, validates them through rigorous statistical independence and variance criteria, and integrates them into the optimization process using adaptive weighting mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments on ChEMBL datasets demonstrate consistent identification of chemically meaningful objectives, such as the hydrogen-bond acceptor/rotatable-bond ratio captures previously unspecified trade-offs between molecular polarity and flexibility. Statistical validation confirms that discovered objectives are independent of predefined criteria while providing significant discriminative power. Performance analysis shows that AMODO-EO successfully extends multi-objective formulations while maintaining competitive optimization performance on original objectives, with only 2-3% performance cost for the discovery capability. The framework opens new possibilities for adaptive optimization in chemical design by automatically revealing hidden molecular relationships that provide actionable insights for drug designers. Our approach represents a significant advancement in computational drug discovery by transforming multi-objective optimization from a purely exploitative process into one that systematically explores the space of potential optimization criteria.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we use whole-genome sequence data from >3,000 wild barn owls from Switzerland to investigate the presence, severity, and genetic architecture of inbreeding depression in three morphological traits. Using a combination of linear models (accounting for age) and non-linear models (to measure growth effects) we clearly show inbreeding depression is present in this population. Moreover, by breaking-down the timing of the effects we also have a better ability to detect inbreeding depression, as in some traits we find that it manifests during juvenile growth, and in others during adulthood. To our knowledge this is the first study to show direct evidence for inbreeding depression during the crucial early life weight gain period in a wild animal. We further show that certain trait-specific patterns may reflect differences in environmental influences across life stages, as we find that heritability is often lower before adulthood. We also use two classes of genomic inbreeding coefficients: Froh and Funi, and while the directionality of effects is equivalent, the strength of evidence regarding the presence of inbreeding depression differs depending on the coefficient used. This discrepancy might give some insight into the frequency distribution of responsible variants, as each coefficient weights variants differently based on their population frequencies. Finally, an assessment of local genomic inbreeding effects highlights a handful of regions with significantly deleterious effects, alongside many regions with a smaller contribution to the observed inbreeding depression.

Here, we investigated the mechanism by which VILMIR regulates the host interferon response in trans by identifying interacting proteins and gene regulatory networks of VILMIR. Through an RNA pull-down assay, we found that VILMIR interacted with both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in vitro, including the transcriptional regulators FUBP1 and PUF60 in the nucleus, as well as the antiviral proteins IFIT1 and IFIT3 and the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases QARS1 and KARS1 in the cytoplasm. In addition, we found that overexpression of VILMIR in A549 cells resulted in an overall enhancement of host interferon response genes and identified a core set of interferon-stimulated genes that were consistently regulated by VILMIR knockdown and overexpression. Finally, we proposed several possible mechanisms by which VILMIR may interact with the identified proteins to regulate the interferon response, such as by interacting with FUBP1 and PUF60 in the nucleus to regulate host transcription in trans or by interacting with the IFIT proteins and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the cytoplasm to regulate translation.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Most studies compare single adolescent and adult age groups using only one type of reward, limiting insight into developmental trajectories underlying behavioral change. Here, we investigated how social, cocaine, and palatable food rewards become associated with environmental contexts in female and male C57BL/6 mice across early- (pubertal onset), mid- (peripubertal phase), and late- (sexual maturity) adolescence, compared to adults. Using the conditioned place preference (CPP) task, we found that generally all rewards induced place preference for the reward-associated context, with only minor effects of sex. In contrast, age significantly influenced CPP expression. Adolescent mice exhibited a significantly reduced CPP compared to adults in palatable food and social CPP paradigms, evident in both decreased mean conditioned context preference and lower proportion of animals that developed a preference after conditioning. Cocaine CPP was not significantly affected by age. Direct comparisons across CPP task outcomes further confirmed that age, rather than reward type or sex, was the primary factor influencing the magnitude of CPP. Specifically, mid- and late-adolescent mice showed reduced mean reward CPP, and mid-adolescents were less likely to express a reward preference relative to adults. Based on the behavioral analyses, we conclude that the lower expression of preference for a conditioned context in adolescent animals is due to developmental changes in reward sensitivity, rather than deficits in learning or higher novelty-seeking behavior.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

First, we processed two single-cell datasets related to human melanoma from GEO (GSE108383_A375 and GSE108383_451Lu) database and trained a fully connected neural network with five adapted methods (L1-Regularization, DeepLIFT, SHAP, IG, LRP) to discriminate between BRAFi-resistant and parental cell lines, followed by identifying top 100 genes. Compared to existing bioinformatics tools from a biological perspective, the presented DL-based methods identified more expressed genes in four well-established melanoma cell lines, including MALME-3M, MDA-MB435, SK-MEL-28, and SK-MEL-5. Moreover, we identified FDA-approved melanoma drugs (e.g., Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib), critical genes such as ARAF, SOX10, DCT, AXL, and key TFs including MITF and TFAP2A. From a classification perspective, we provided gene sets by all methods to three machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine, random forests, and neural networks.

FeatureDCA allows sampling to be guided toward specific regions of sequence space while maintaining the efficiency and interpretability of Potts-based inference. Across multiple protein families, our autoregressive implementation of FeatureDCA matches or surpasses the generative accuracy of established models in reproducing higher-order sequence statistics while preserving substantial sequence diversity. Structural validation with AlphaFold and ESMFold confirms that generated sequences adopt folds consistent with their intended wild-type targets. In a detailed case study of the Response Regulator family (PF00072), which comprises distinct structural subclasses linked to different DNA-binding domains, FeatureDCA accurately reproduces class-specific architectures when conditioned on subtype-specific principal components, highlighting its potential for fine-grained structural control. Predictions of experimental deep mutational scanning data show accuracy comparable to that of unconditioned autoregressive Potts models, indicating that FeatureDCA also captures local functional constraints.

Recent technological advancements in linking single-cell gene expression with genotype have improved our understanding of tumor heterogeneity. However, current methodologies have limitations in simultaneously genotyping low-expression genes (such as JAK2) alongside other pathogenic loci. To address this, we developed a novel long read genotyping of transcriptomes pipeline called LOTR-Seq, which can genotype the full length of 30 expressed genes at once. Using LOTR-Seq, we genotyped HSPCs at the JAK2V617F locus in 9,075 single cells from eight patients with chronic phase MPN (CP-MPN) and in 5,016 cells from four patients with post-MPN AML.

Here we present MetaProViz (Metabolomics Processing, functional analysis and Visualization), a free open-source R package for metabolomics data analysis that integrates prior knowledge to generate mechanistic hypotheses (https://saezlab.github.io/MetaProViz/). MetaProViz offers a flexible framework consisting of five modules: processing, differential analysis, prior knowledge integration, functional analysis and visualisation, applicable to both intracellular and exometabolomics experiments. To improve functional analysis, we created the Metabolism Signature Database (MetSigDB), a collection of annotated metabolite sets. MetSigDB includes classical pathway-metabolite sets, metabolite-receptor and metabolite-transporter sets, and chemical class-metabolite sets. In addition, MetaProViz enables the conversion of gene sets to metabolite sets by using enzyme-metabolic reaction associations. In addition, MetaProViz translates between metabolite identifiers of commonly used databases, analyzes mapping ambiguities and completes missing annotations. The MetaProViz functional analysis toolkit includes sample metadata analysis, classical enrichment analysis and biologically informed clustering. We showcase MetaProViz functionalities using kidney cancer metabolomics data from cell lines, cell-culture media, and tumour tissue. We found increased methionine usage in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines in line with decreased methionine levels in tumour samples. Further, we link this observation to enzymes and transporters crucial for overall survival in ccRCC and suggest that the increased methionine usage reflects the elevated DNA-hypermethylation landscape, a known characteristic in ccRCC.

We developed a component-based preprocessing approach adapted from fMRI, which models structured noise using tissue-specific regressors and removes low-frequency uptake trends from the fPET signal (CompCor). We applied this method to 20 high-temporal [18F]FDG fPET scans from a next-generation long-axial field of view PET/CT system (1s frames) and 16 scans from a conventional PET/MR scanner (3s frames).

Metabolic connectivity was markedly influenced by filtering strategy and scanner type. The CompCor filter produced more consistent and structured networks than standard bandpass filters. Intermediate frequency bands (0.01-0.1 Hz) yielded the most reliable connectivity patterns between PET/CT and PET/MR data (r=0.89). High sensitivity PET/CT data revealed structured connectivity patterns also at a higher frequency band (0.1-0.2 Hz).

The impact of avian biodiversity on WNV circulation remains debated, with studies reporting both negative and positive correlations (dilution and amplification effects respectively) across different settings. In Europe, this relationship remains largely unexplored, particularly in regions with high WNV transmission, such as Emilia-Romagna in Northern Italy. We explored the association between avian biodiversity and WNV circulation in Culex mosquitoes in Emilia-Romagna using 11 consecutive years (2013-2023) of entomological surveillance data paired with two avian data sources. We calculated avian biodiversity indices (Shannons, Simpsons, and Chao2) from observation records from the Farmland Bird Index project and applied linear regression models to assess their relationship with WNV circulation levels. Moreover, we used Bayesian spatiotemporal regression models and gridded weekly avian abundance estimates from the eBird project, to analyse the associations between avian species richness indices and WNV-positivity rates at 68 geolocated mosquito traps across the region. We observed consistent negative associations between WNV circulation in the Culex population and avian biodiversity indices, supporting the dilution effect hypothesis (DEH). We found that non-passerine species richness was negatively associated with WNV mosquito circulation, whereas passerine species richness exhibited a positive association after adjusting for environmental factors and spatial random effects. These findings suggest that passerines may amplify WNV transmission, while the presence of non-passerine species is associated with reductions in WNV circulation. This study provides the first empirical evidence supporting the DEH for WNV in Europe.

As downstream effectors of nutrient-dependent cell signalling pathways, including insulin/IGF signalling, they integrate signals from multiple stimuli to orchestrate appropriate transcriptional responses to changes in the nutritional environment. Traditionally, FOXO-dependent responses have been attributed to target gene regulation through direct interactions with regulatory regions by DNA-binding via the conserved Forkhead (FH) domain. However, emerging evidence suggests that FOXO proteins may also influence gene expression through DNA-binding-independent mechanisms. However, differences in transcriptional outputs between DNA-binding dependent and independent FOXO functions have yet to be explored. Here, we have used genomic engineering of the endogenous Drosophila foxo locus to disrupt the DNA-binding activity of the single fly FOXO orthologue, allowing us to dissect the in vivo contributions of canonical and non-canonical dFOXO functions. We show that while DNA-binding is essential for several dFOXO-mediated phenotypes including female fecundity, lifespan, and resistance to oxidative and xenobiotic stress, other traits such as adult body size and survival during starvation remain intact. Notably, DNA-binding-deficient dFOXO flies exhibit defective lipid mobilisation under starvation, implicating a DNA-binding-independent role for dFOXO in metabolic regulation. Differential gene expression analysis during starvation in these mutants revealed key transcriptional changes in genes encoding metabolic regulators as well as regulators of transcription and chromatin structure. Together, these findings reveal distinct modes of dFOXO transcriptional regulation that depend on its direct association with DNA.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Metastatic niches exhibited significant depletion of protective fibroblast subpopulations (F2RL2: reduced from 1.9% to 0.1%; COL6A6: reduced from 3.1% to 1.3%); this depletion coincided with ECM dissolution and disrupted spatial coordination of immune markers (proximity-dependent HLA-DRA/CXCL9 expression). High expression of these DEGs correlated with improved recurrence-free survival (e.g., COL6A6: HR = 0.19, p = 0.002); genomic deletions of the DEGs were significantly more frequent in metastases versus primary tumors (e.g., MAB21L1 deep deletion: 9.13% vs. 0.57%). Conclusion: An unbiased transcriptomic approach revealed specialized fibroblast subpopulations as central gatekeepers against LNM via ECM, immune, and signaling barriers. Their erosion drives stromal collapse in metastasis. Epigenetic modulators (Valproic Acid, Vorinostat) were prioritized for therapeutic restoration of suppressive stroma.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Physics-based inverse-scattering methods aim to computationally recover this information, often using non-convex optimization to reconstruct the scatter-corrected sample. However, this non-convexity can lead to inaccurate reconstructions, especially in highly scattering samples. Here, we show that various implementation strategies for even the same inverse-scattering method significantly affect reconstruction quality. We demonstrate this using multi-slice beam propagation (MSBP), a relatively simple nonconvex inverse-scattering method that reconstructs the 3D refractive-index (RI) distribution of the sample. By systematically conducting MSBP-based inverse-scattering on both phantoms and biological samples, we showed that an amplitude-only cost function in the inverse-solver, combined with angular and defocus diversity in the scattering measurements, enabled high-quality, fully-volumetric RI imaging. This approach achieved subcellular resolution and label-free 3D contrast across diverse, multiple-scattering samples. These results lay the groundwork for robust use of inverse-scattering techniques to achieve biologically interpretable 3D imaging in increasingly thick, multicellular samples, introducing a new paradigm for deep-tissue computational imaging.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "A patient with a medical condition can have medical tests or symptoms scored that generate numerical results before a treatment, during a treatment or after a treatment, usually over several days, to determine if any benefits have occurred. The changes in the numerical measurements or scores over time can be readily plotted using computer software to show an equation for the line of best fit for either linear or log equations, together with the coefficient of determination (R2). Despite the ease of generating this type of graphical representations caution is required in interpreting the R2 value with reference to medical case reports. To understand why this is so, at a basic level, four scenarios using hypothetical patient scores were used to generate scatter plots showing the equation for the line of best fit and R2 values with comparison to the average and standard deviation (SD) values. The graphical examples are used to supplement the more complex mathematical and statistical explanations and choice for effect measures that are available. It was found R2 values for log equations for the line of best fit did not follow a trend with increasing treatment days. For linear equations, higher R2 value may not necessarily correspond to a lower standard deviation (SD) value for the averaged scores. The R2 value can be influenced by the day on which the scores were recorded, despite the equivalence of the average scores and SD values. R2 values may not indicate the strength of a treatment benefit or the magnitude of scatter between data sets. Score averaging can increase R2 values, while average values remain the same but with the SD value decreasing. The graphical examples shown provide an explanation why line graphs may be the simplest and best option for reporting, particularly non-linear numerical data, in case reports.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we use equilibrium and targeted molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how alanine substitutions at these positions alter CB1 dynamics. Our results show that mutations, especially the F200A+W356A combination, enhanced conformational flexibility and shifted the receptor toward inactive-like states. W3566.48 emerged as a structural pivot essential for active-state stability, F2003.36 acted as a late-stage kinetic barrier to inactivation, and W2795.43 modulated orthosteric pocket packing and flexibility, amplifying destabilization when combined with F2003.36 or W3566.48 mutations.

Here, we identify cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes 1 (CREG1) as a key regulator of mitochondrial function and a critical immune-related gene involved in ALV-J infection. The objective of this study was to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of CREG1 in the context of ALV-J infection. Overexpression of CREG1 upregulates the expression of type I interferon (I-IFN) and certain interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby suppressing viral replication. Mechanistically, overexpression of CREG1 induces mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}m), reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and respiratory chain activity, enhanced mitophagy, and increased release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which in turn triggers the activation of innate immune responses. Mitochondrial dysfunction further leads to the cytosolic release of cytochrome c and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby triggering a robust apoptotic response. Moreover, the regulation of mitochondrial function by CREG1 depends on its interaction with the mitochondrial chaperone protein heat shock protein 1 (HSPD1), and their co-expression synergistically amplifies the antiviral response. In this study, we identify CREG1 as a potent antiviral gene and underscore the pivotal roles of mitochondria-mediated innate immunity and apoptosis during ALV-J infection.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

We ask how semantic composition modulates the neural representations of underlying concepts. Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multivariate pattern analysis, we interrogate neural patterns for concepts before and after they were subjected to semantic composition. We observe a post-composition shift in neural patterns underlying weakly constrained concepts in the visual system. The composition of strongly constrained combinations draws on a network of semantic regions that include the right inferior frontal gyrus, left angular gyrus, left lateral anterior temporal lobe, and posterior cingulate cortex. Finally, a subset of the semantic network, in left parahippocampal gyrus, distinguishes the manner of composition: relational or attributive.

Moreover, the success of captive breeding programs has also declined precipitously, driven primarily by the species' high susceptibility to Mycobacterium avium , avian tuberculosis (TB). Here we compare genome-wide patterns of diversity between a wild population and a serially sampled captive population of WWWDs. Captive birds, which originated from northeast India, are highly genetically differentiated from wild birds sampled in Sumatra, Indonesia, likely reflecting long-standing phylogeographic structure in the natural population. Both the wild and captive populations have similarly low overall genetic diversity, comparable to other endangered species. Surprisingly, the wild-sampled birds had higher inbreeding coefficients than the captive birds, though captive genetic diversity has eroded over time. Most importantly, captive birds with higher levels of inbreeding succumb earlier to TB infections, suggesting inbreeding depression. Although wild Indonesian birds had low overall genetic diversity, reflecting long term and anthropogenically induced declines, they harbored significantly higher genetic diversity than captive birds in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), a key component of the adaptive immune system. We also find that MHC genes are differentially expressed between susceptible WWWDs and resistant redhead ducks Aythya americana, suggesting a possible mechanism for TB susceptibility. The greater MHC diversity in wild populations suggests that wild birds may yet harbor key functional diversity that provides hope for both ex-situ and in-situ conservation efforts.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Previously we have shown that ET-resistant breast cancer cells exhibit reduced ceramide levels and an increased sensitivity to ceramide-induced cell death. Here, we demonstrate that ceramides induce a distinct transcriptional reprogramming in ET-resistant cells, characterized by upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (EnRS) pathways. Ceramide-induced EnRS is PERK-dependent and functionally linked to cell death in multiple models of ET resistance. Using a photoactivatable ceramide probe, we identify TRAM1 as a functionally important ceramide-interacting protein (CIP) in ET-resistant cells that correlates with worse relapse-free survival and a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype in luminal breast cancer patients. Additionally, knockdown of TRAM1 phenocopies ceramide action in ET resistance, thereby suggesting its role in mediating ceramide-induced lethal actions in ET resistance. Together, our findings reveal that ET-resistant breast cancer cells are more sensitive to PERK-mediated EnRS as compared to their ET-sensitive counterparts. Ceramides can exploit this dependence by interacting with CIPs such as TRAM1, leading to PERK activation and consequential cell death preferentially in the ET-resistant breast cancer models.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Psidium cattleyanum is a valuable model for investigating this relationship, as it is a polyploid species with multiple ploidy levels and exhibits pseudogamous gametophytic apomixis. In addition, it is a fruit tree of commercial, agricultural, and medicinal interest in its native range, but it is also an aggressive invasive species in regions where it has been introduced. In this study, we aim to determine the predominant reproductive mode in natural populations of the polyploid Psidium cattleyanum f. lucidum and to investigate whether this mode is associated with specific ploidy levels. Furthermore, we investigate whether these reproductive traits are linked to patterns of genetic diversity and population genetic structure. Methods We assessed the reproductive mode in wild populations representing the four ploidy levels (2C = 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x) present in Uruguay. Reproductive pathways were inferred by combining flow cytometric seed screen (FCSS) analysis with microsatellite (SSR) genotyping of progeny arrays. Population-level differences were evaluated across both data sets. Key Results Pseudogamous apomixis is the predominant reproductive mode in Uruguayan P. cattleyanum f. lucidum populations. The proportions of apomictic versus sexual reproduction, and the types of progenies produced, differed significantly among populations and ploidy levels. Genotyping revealed predominantly clonal progeny, yet with high genetic variability, and populations exhibit strong genetic structure. The ploidy level of the gametes and their combinations were characteristic of each population, leading to different reproductive strategies. Conclusions Facultative pseudogamous apomixis is the primary reproductive mode in natural populations of Psidium cattleyanum f. lucidum. Ploidy level influences reproductive strategy, as reflected in the apomixis/sexuality ratios and the type of progeny produced.

While many models of cytosolic proteostasis emphasize heat shock response as critical for regulating cellular protein folding, a comprehensive understanding of transcriptional modules that may regulate cytosolic protein folding is lacking. Through a focused screening for transcription factors, we provide evidence that a number of transcriptional programs unlinked to canonical proteotoxic response are involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis of protein folding. Among these, Arg80, a regulator of arginine metabolism, was activated during proteotoxic stress and found essential for mitigating it. We show that proteostasis imbalance in arg80{Delta} cells is caused by excess arginine accumulation, which is sufficient to impair protein folding. We reveal a complex interplay between arginine repression (Arg80), trehalose biosynthesis (Tps2), and the integrated stress response (Gcn2) in combating proteotoxic insults. We posit that multiple metabolic pathways integrate with classical protein quality control networks to regulate the protein folding environment. Harnessing these metabolic circuits may offer new avenues to modulate proteostasis when needed.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Therefore, even when closely related species have otherwise divergent diets, a shared biomechanically challenging resource should be reflected in similar adaptations to jaw biomechanics. We assessed this in two species of rat-kangaroos, whose otherwise divergent diets include the extremely tough-shelled seeds of Santalum spp. (sandalwood and/or quandong). We used geometric morphometrics to analyse cranial shape of 161 bettongs (Bettongia spp.), including all four extant species. We identified adaptations to higher bite forces in both species that crack open Santalum seeds. However, B. lesueur had shorter facial proportions, indicating higher mechanical advantage, while B. penicillata had a premolar morphology that likely focussed bites to a specific, reinforced position on the jaw. This represents an example of many-to-one mapping at the genus level. We also found differences in a subsample of captive northern bettongs compared to wild conspecifics, suggesting some role of phenotypic plasticity in shaping adult skulls. The large olfactory tracts of B. penicillata, that support search for underground fungi, might have constrained its cranium to retain longer proportions.

While extensive attention has been focussed on food resources for pollinators, comparatively little research has examined resources for aphidophagous insects . Many ants, such as Lasius niger, are highly aphidophagous, relying on honeydew secretions for the majority of their carbohydrate intake. Ants will also often reject sugar solution which is of lower concentration than that they were expecting. Here, we ask whether Lasius niger ants from urban environments show differential acceptance to various sucrose solution molarities. We offered outgoing ants on active foraging trails drops of sucrose solutions over a range of molarities (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2M), and quantified acceptance. Acceptance was scored using a simple behavioural measure of whether the ant remained in contact with the sucrose drop for over 3 seconds (full acceptance), broke away from the drop within 3 seconds but remained in the area and eventually drank to satiation (partial acceptance), or did not drink to satiation and walked away (rejection). Urban ants showed a significantly higher acceptance of all sucrose molarities than rural ants, with this difference especially pronounced at lower molarities. This may indicate that they are under nutritional stress for carbohydrates. Ant responses to sucrose solutions may allow a straightforward measure of the availability of carbohydrate resources in the environment.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

We found that Lewis flax consists of four main genetic clusters and that this structuring occurred within the last 100,000 years, during the Last Glacial Period, with the Rocky Mountains as a likely geographic barrier. We also show evidence suggesting that current northern populations of Lewis flax are the result of a range expansion following the Last Glacial Maximum, accompanied by a shift towards increased selfing. We discuss how these continental-scale phylogeographic trends can inform Lewis flax domestication efforts and its continued use in ecological restoration.

Exploiting the conserved avian karyotype with high variation in recombination rate and GC content, we quantified the joint effects of effective population size (Ne), recombination and GC-biased gene-conversion (gBGC). In agreement with the nearly-neutral theory of molecular evolution, mutation load was substantially elevated in populations with small Ne. Purging efficacy increased with recombination rate resulting in more than a two-fold difference of genetic load between large and small chromosomes. GC-biased mutations contributed about one third to the pool of deleterious mutations. Their expected accumulation in regions of high recombination was offset by purging efficacy in large, but not small populations.

N.", "abstract": "Early-stage sparse testing can significantly increase genetic gain in plant breeding programmes, facilitating the development of varieties with high and stable performance across farmers' fields. This is achieved through (1) increased selection accuracy, enabled by broader sampling of trial sites across the Target Population of Environments (TPE), and (2) increased selection intensity by testing more selection candidates at a reduced replication rate. Early-stage agronomic testing typically involves evaluating a large number of selection candidates at one or a few experimental sites. Although these sites may poorly represent the TPE, strong selection pressure is generally applied. However, if the genetic correlation between performance at the experimental sites and in the TPE is low, most of the genetic gain achieved through selection will not be expressed under farmers' conditions. Sparse testing addresses this challenge by using farm-as-incomplete-block designs, in which different subsets of selection candidates are evaluated across sites. By leveraging a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) to connect genotypes across environments, sparse testing enables early-stage multi-environment trials with broader coverage of the TPE. Here, we used stochastic simulation to compare various partially replicated sparse testing strategies to three fully replicated conventional early-stage testing strategies, with and without GRM. All sparse testing strategies achieved substantially higher and more stable genetic gain than the conventional strategies. Our results show that sparse testing provides breeders with a powerful and flexible framework to rethink early-stage trials and design cost-effective, multi-location experiments that lay the foundation for increased genetic gains in farmers' fields.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

These findings highlight two patterns of KPC spread: transmission of epidemic lineages harboring broad-range and lineage-specific KPC plasmids; and broader spread of AK975 among diverse species. Traditional surveillance studies often focus on common MDR lineages, potentially overlooking rare species and lineages that mediate the spread of plasmid-borne antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Here we show how longitudinal studies tracking plasmids across species are essential to understand the pathways leading to AMR infections in hospitals.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Y.; Jerby, L.; Kundaje, A.; Greenleaf, W. J.; Bassik, M. C.", "abstract": "Macrophages are capable of eliminating cancer cells by phagocytosis, particularly in the presence of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies targeting tumor antigens. Paradoxically, tumor-associated macrophages are typically associated with poor patient outcome, and can promote tumor growth by secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines and growth factors. The mechanisms by which these pro-tumor macrophage states arise are poorly understood, and it is unclear how mAb-induced cancer cell phagocytosis may contribute to these states. To understand how antibody-dependent cancer cell phagocytosis (ADCP) alters macrophage state and function, we profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes over time after ADCP. We observed that after ADCP, macrophages upregulate an anti-inflammatory gene regulatory program, characterized by expression of pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive chemokine genes, and increased activity by cellular, oxidative, and lysosomal stress transcription factors. This gene regulatory program was shared among phagocytic macrophages following either ADCP or apoptotic cancer cell phagocytosis, in addition to substrate-specific pathways. Conditioned media from macrophages promoted EMT in cancer cells, but this pro-EMT macrophage phenotype was attenuated following ADCP, but not following apoptotic cancer cell phagocytosis. The phagocytic gene signature we identified in vitro is also expressed by tumor-associated macrophages across numerous cancer types in vivo. Together, this work identifies an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive epigenetic program in macrophages following ADCP upon mAb treatment, and expands our understanding of how phagocytosis influences macrophage heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

The bacterium has been detected only sporadically in Norway during the last decades, but the country experienced several geographically spread outbreaks since December 2022. The phylogenomic relationships of R. salmoninarum isolates associated with the epizootics ongoing on the West Coast and in Mid-Norway were explored using a whole genome sequencing approach. A broad overview of the phylogeography of this pathogen was gained through sequencing and analysis of a collection of isolates from Norway (n=67), Iceland (n=12), Denmark (n=12), and the Faroe Islands (n=1), along with a collection of 109 publicly available sequences. We identified two distinct contemporary clades of R. salmoninarum causing BKD in Norway in the period 2022-2024. Both clades belong to the expanding, aquaculture-associated Lineage 1. The epidemiological picture appears consistent with contemporary aquaculture operations, raising questions on the effectiveness or practice of current biosecurity practices towards R. salmoninarum. Our work also describes a hitherto undescribed lineage (Lineage 3), predominantly from Iceland, where BKD is considered endemic. The detection of endemic reservoirs of R. salmoninarum in European water systems underscores the potential for ongoing pathogen circulation independent of acute outbreaks. This finding emphasizes the importance of further investigation of the mechanisms of pathogen persistence, particularly within environments related to aquaculture, where chronic infection reservoirs could compromise disease management and biosecurity.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

In addition, the subpopulations of large LDs and small LDs were purified and studied, respectively. We report the first comprehensive proteo-lipidomic analysis of these LDs. Unexpectedly, about 19.3% of the plaque LD proteins belonged to cytoskeleton, while the content of lipid metabolism enzymes on plaque LDs was low. Our results show that the compositions of lipids and proteins were similar between two population LDs. Compared to soft (lipid) plaque LDs, LDs from mixed and hard (calcified) plaques had fewer metabolic enzymes and more cytoskeletal proteins. Lipidomics of the LD core uncovered an unexpected enrichment of polyunsaturated fatty acid cholesteryl esters (PUFA-CEs), which constituted 88.3% of all cholesterol esters. Notably, esters of the pro-inflammatory precursor arachidonic acid (AA) were among the most abundant species (16.5%). In addition, plaque LD were uniquely enriched in phospholipids including phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylethanolamine plasmagens (PE-P), sphingomyelin (SM), and phosphatidylserine (PS).

One attractive control strategy would be based on the understanding of the virulence mechanisms of BPH at the molecular level and then designing targeted methods to neutralize such mechanisms. Salivary proteins of BPH are important players in mediating rice-BPH interactions. Here, we describe a pivotal role of a watery saliva protein, NlAnnexin-like5 (NlANX5), in the rice-BPH interaction. RNA interference (RNAi) of NlANX5 greatly compromised BPH feeding performance and survival rate on rice plants. NlANX5-RNAi BPH triggered a rapid calcium ion influx in rice cells. The feeding and survival defects of NlANX5-RNAi BPH can be restored in NlANX5-expressing transgenic rice plants. NlANX5 targets rice annexin (OsANN) proteins, including OsANN2 and OsANN8. Further analysis with NlANX5 and OsANN2 as well as OsANN8 showed that NlANX5 displaces OsANN2 and OsANN8 from the rice cell membrane. The osann2 osann8 mutant rice plants are hypersusceptible to BPH infestation. In contrast, enhanced expression of OsANN2 and OsANN8 gene resulted in robust rice resistance against BPH.

This study aimed to investigate whether naturally occurring variation in speech disfluency is associated with grey matter structure in a non-clinical, population-based sample of 5-year-old children. The study included 120 participants (65M, 55F) from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort study. Speech disfluency was evaluated as a continuous measure from audiovisual speech samples, with transcription and analysis conducted using the SALT software. Ambrose & Yairi (1999) classification system was used to categorize speech disfluencies into stuttering-like (SLD) and other disfluency types. T1-weighted images obtained through magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with the CAT12 toolbox and complemented by surface-based morphometry with FreeSurfer. Whole-brain statistical analysis was employed to examine the association between grey matter metrics and speech disfluency. We found that VBM-derived proportional grey matter volume in the left middle frontal gyrus, left posterior cerebellum, and right superior frontal gyrus was positively associated with speech disfluency, specifically SLD, in children (p <.001; p=.002; p <.001, FDR corrected). No significant associations were found for cortical thickness or surface area. Additionally, no notable sex differences were observed. Our findings suggest that speech disfluency in early childhood is linked to localized structural differences in regions supporting motor planning and cognitive control, without broader changes in cortical thickness or surface area. Importantly, similar brain regions have been implicated in studies comparing children who stutter to those who do not, suggesting that normal variation in disfluency captures meaningful neurobiological differences even in non-clinical populations. This supports the value of treating speech disfluency as a spectrum and underscores the importance of longitudinal, multimodal research to clarify how these structural features evolve and influence later fluency outcomes.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

J.; Daou, A.", "abstract": "Temperature fluctuations can have detrimental effects on the firing pattern and electrical activity of biological neurons, eliciting diverse responses depending on the neuronal cell types and the underlying ion channels exhibited. Using the classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, we performed a comprehensive dynamical systems analysis to determine how temperature fluctuations alter neuronal excitability, spike morphology, and bifurcation structure. We first relied on experimentally-derived temperature coefficients, or Q10 values, associated with gating kinetics and conductances, and examined codimension-1 and codimension-2 bifurcations across a range of temperatures and standard HH parameters governing the intrinsic properties (firing frequency, spike amplitude, spike width, afterhyperpolarization (AHP), time-to-peak AHP, etc...) of the model HH neuron. Our analysis revealed that increasing temperature accelerates gating dynamics, leading to narrower and higher-frequency spikes but reduced amplitudes, and ultimately to a loss of sustained firing via temperature-induced depolarization block. We identified generalized Hopf (Bautin) bifurcations as critical boundaries beyond which the system becomes strictly monostable. Extending the model to independently scale sodium activation, sodium inactivation, and potassium activation kinetics showed that excitability is particularly sensitive to potassium gating dynamics. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding temperature modulations of neuronal activity, highlighting how temperature reshapes the excitability landscape, unveiling the intricate interplays between the activation/inactivation kinetics of ion channels, and identifying key parameters governing temperature robustness in neuronal models.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

E.; Goodfellow, M.", "abstract": "Neural mass models (NMMs) are often used to help understand the circuitry that underpins observed brain dynamics in basic and clinical research. A key step is to fuse models with data so that model parameter values can be inferred for a given data set, a process called model fitting or model calibration. This can shed light on putative physiological mechanisms underlying the observed signals. Calibration is notoriously challenging in biology since models are often non-identifiable, high-dimensional, and nonlinear. Established methods such as dynamic causal modelling (DCM) circumvent some of these issues, for example, by incorporating prior information and employing fast local search methods in the space of feasible parameter values (\"parameter space\"). However, it is pertinent to better understand the potential limitations of these methods so that we can increase our confidence in the use of models to interpret brain activity, and to develop new approaches as required. Here we use tools from dynamical systems theory to illustrate some of the complexities of model calibration in an archetypal NMM. We use this information to motivate the use of calibration methods that work across large regions of parameter space, rather than focusing on informative priors or localised search methods. We subsequently evaluate the performance of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and evolutionary search metaheuristics (ESMs) for mapping feasible sets of parameters for which an NMM can recreate electroencephalographic recordings during an eyes-closed resting state. Our results demonstrate the superiority of ESMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, we elucidate potential reasons why ESMs are able to perform better than ABC, i.e. that they are less susceptible to biases induced by the complexity of underlying cost landscapes.

In contrast, emerging studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have begun to reveal neuronal functions of claudin-like proteins. However, a systematic analysis of their neuronal expression has not been performed. We conducted a transcriptional reporter screen of all claudin-like genes in C. elegans and identified several candidates with previously unreported neuronal expression, highlighting a broader role of this family in the nervous system.

Functional analyses of clc-3 mutants revealed increased body-bend amplitude and elevated evoked postsynaptic currents at the cholinergic neuromuscular synapses. Imaging and molecular interaction studies demonstrated that CLC-3 localises to the presynaptic membranes in cholinergic neurons, where it interacts with the actin-binding protein NAB-1 and regulates cholinergic signalling. This presynaptic role of CLC-3 likely contributes to the regulation of sinusoidal movement in C. elegans.

However, biochemical evidence for dyskerin dimerization is still lacking, and it remains unclear whether mutations in these regions impair hTR binding by disrupting dimerization. Here, we provide the first biochemical evidence that dyskerin undergoes dimerization. We further demonstrate that dimerization is RNA independent and not abolished by disease mutations in the N-terminal extension or 2' helix. Instead, these mutations impair hTR binding. Our findings offer new mechanistic insight into how mutations in the dyskerin N-terminal extension and 2' helix contribute to the pathogenesis of X-DC.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Aurora B phosphorylates BubR1 at serines 16 and 39 in an unattachment-dependent manner, which is a prerequisite for BubR1 acetylation at lysine 250 (K250). Utilizing a novel anti-AcK250 monoclonal antibody in structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we reveal that BubR1 acetylation is associated with kinetochore expansion, evidenced by crescent-shaped volume increase of ZW10 and Mad2 surrounding the kinetochore. Furthermore, K250-BubR1 acetylation enhances its interaction with CENP-E, a kinesin crucial for chromosome alignment through facilitating end-on attachment. Disrupting Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of Ser16/39 impaired K250 acetylation, compromising both fibrous corona polymerization and mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) maintenance. Conversely, introducing K250 acetylation mimetic form rescued MCC and fibrous corona in cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient S16A/S39A mutants. Our findings reveal Aurora B-BubR1 acetylation axis as a critical SAC signaling pathway, interlinking unattachment sensing with kinetochore expansion and SAC activity. We propose that this stepwise phosphorylation-acetylation on BubR1 constitutes a crucial part of SAC signaling code, transducing unattachment signal to fibrous corona polymerization and SAC activity. This phosphorylation-acetylation cascade in BubR1 offers potential therapeutic targets in treating cancers of chromosome instability.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

We first show that this form of familiarity navigation is consistent with scorpion homing excursions.

A.; Hosseini, S. M.; Kireeva, S.", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel, physiologically inspired framework for reconstructing missing pupil data during blink-induced interruptions. Pupillometry has become integral to studies of cognition, emotion, and neural function, yet the frequent data gaps caused by blinks can compromise the accuracy of inferences drawn from pupil measurements. This approach addresses these challenges by introducing an exponential recovery model that dynamically adjusts its time constant in proportion to blink duration, thus capturing the non-linear dynamics of pupil responses more effectively than traditional interpolation methods. A localised noise estimation procedure further enhances realism by incorporating both signal-dependent and baseline noise derived from statistical properties of the data surrounding each blink. Additionally, a Savitzky-Golay filter is selectively applied to the reconstructed intervals, preserving key physiological features while mitigating high-frequency artefacts. To facilitate the implementation of our framework, we introduce PRPIP, a Python package that implements our methodology. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of this method using empirical pupil data from visual tasks, illustrating that the reconstructed signals maintain physiological fidelity across a range of blink durations. These findings underscore the potential of combining physiological principles with data-driven noise modelling to generate robust, continuous pupil traces. By offering a more accurate reconstruction of pupil size, this framework stands to advance pupillometric research in fields ranging from cognitive psychology to clinical neuroscience.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Condensate function is dictated not only by its molecular composition, but also by substructural organization and molecular mobility. One hypothesis for the onset of multiple protein aggregation diseases is that the increased densities of specific proteins within BMCs promotes the formation of solid inclusions. However, deciphering the internal structural and functional properties of BMCs at the nanoscale and identifying the initiating events of inclusion formation requires tools with high spatiotemporal precision. Here we show using single molecule and other microscopy approaches that single component Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) condensates exhibit confinement and contain clusters with higher FUS density even at early timepoints. Upon aging, condensates displayed altered physical properties and reduced monomer mobility, and yet most FUS monomers diffused throughout the condensate within seconds. While an increase in connectivity over time explains reduced mobility, the large fraction of molecules retaining high mobility suggests a sponge-like structure rather than a system-spanning network. These findings indicate that a pseudo-equilibrium between distinct structural connectivities can exist within simple condensates, suggesting the potential for substantial structural and functional complexity of BMCs at the nanoscale.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

At the cellular level, through both direct and indirect effects, the drug induces a specific pattern of gene expression, which differs between the basal ganglia and frontal cortex. These risperidone-regulated changes influence neuronal plasticity and are crucial for both its antipsychotic and extrapyramidal effects. Here, we employed sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively characterize gene expression changes in the male mouse (Mus musculus L.) forebrain after an acute dose of risperidone (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). The transcriptional patterns were structure-specific, and unsupervised clustering of spatial profiles accurately identified cortical divisions, layers, and basal ganglia subregions. Differential gene expression was subsequently analyzed within each anatomically defined cluster using a customized statistical framework. Risperidone significantly altered the levels of 95 transcripts across 12 brain regions. The largest number of changes was observed in ventral brain areas, including the olfactory tubercle (25 differentially regulated transcripts), the diagonal band nucleus (22), the corpus callosum and commissures (13), and the lateral septal nucleus (9). Notably, 21 of the 95 differentially expressed genes were previously associated with schizophrenia, including Olig2, Smpd3, and Cacna1i. Overall, our results indicate that the strongest effects of risperidone are in medial and ventral brain regions rich in oligodendrocytes and glial cells.

Using genetically encoded sensors targeted to the cytosol and mitochondria, we tracked beat-resolved ATP dynamics in intact mouse SA node and isolated myocytes. Cytosolic ATP rose transiently with each Ca2+ transient and segregated into high- and low-gain phenotypes defined by the Ca2+-ATP coupling slope. Mitochondrial ATP flux adopted two stereotyped waveforms--Mode-1 ''gains'' and Mode-2 ''dips''. Within Mode-1 cells, ATP gains mirrored the cytosolic high/low-gain dichotomy; Mode-2 dips scaled linearly with Ca2+ load and predominated in slower-firing cells. In the intact node, high-gain/Mode-1 phenotypes localized to superior regions and low-gain/Mode-2 to inferior regions, paralleling gradients in rate, mitochondrial volume, and capillary density. Pharmacology placed the Ca2+ clock upstream of ATP production: the HCN channel blocker ivabradine slowed the ATP cycle without changing amplitude, whereas the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin or the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP abolished transients. Mode-2 recovery kinetics indicate slower ATP replenishment that would favor low-frequency, fluctuation-rich firing in a subset of cells. Together, these findings reveal beat-locked metabolic microdomains in which the Ca2+ clock times oxidative phosphorylation under a local O2 ceiling, unifying vascular architecture, mitochondrial organization, and Ca2+ signaling to coordinate energy supply with excitability.

We established an HPLC-based method to sensitively evaluate the RCS-scavenging ability of compounds, using Acr as a representative RCS. Among 80% ethanol extracts of 46 angiosperm species, the highest scavenging activities were observed in garlic, spinach, avocado, broccoli, and lotus, representing a diverse range of plant families. The active ingredient from garlic cloves was identified as S-allyl cysteine sulfoxide (alliin), an amino acid typical of Allium species, which trapped up to two Acr molecules at its amino group. Notably, S-(1E)-propenyl cysteine sulfoxide (isoalliin), a structural analog of alliin and a major constituent of onion, showed even stronger Acr-scavenging activity. Isoalliin outperformed known Acr scavengers such as carnosine, epigallocatechin gallate, resveratrol, and hesperetin. These findings highlight isoalliin as a representative plant-derived RCS scavenger and emphasize the importance of S-alk(en)yl cysteine sulfoxides as potent Acr-scavenging compounds in plants.

While small RNAs have been extensively studied in this context, the epididymal contribution to larger sperm RNAs, such as mRNAs, remains underexplored. mRNAs were among the first RNA species identified in sperm, yet their functional relevance has remained elusive, largely due to the translational quiescence of mature spermatozoa and the hypothesis that these RNAs are residual by-products of spermatogenesis. Yet, mRNAs carried by sperm have been detected in the zygote, indicating they could play a role beyond fertilization.

Central European forest management strategies promoting structurally homogeneous closed-canopy forests have led to landscape-level declines in biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality. Conservation-targeted management programs aim at reintroducing structural heterogeneity into production forests, however, it is not well understood if species diversity and ecosystem functions generally profit from management promoting heterogeneity in forest structure. By removing and processing mammalian dung remains, dung beetles play an integral role in ecosystem functions in forests. 2. In one of the largest manipulative forest experiments in Central Europe to date, we analysed the effects of enhanced structural heterogeneity in production forests, climate, and mammalian defecation on dung beetle diversity and dung removal rates at the local and landscape level. We assessed communities of dung beetles and dung removal rates on 234 study patches (50 x 50 m) in eleven paired forest landscapes across a climatic gradient in Germany. Forest landscapes were either managed to conserve a homogeneous closed canopy or to create a heterogeneous forest structure with forest patches varying in canopy coverage and dead wood availability. 3. We did not find that more heterogeneously managed forests had higher dung beetle species diversity and dung removal rates. Canopy openings did not increase species turnover but decreased species diversity. 4. Along the climate gradient, dung beetle average biomass and dung removal decreased with increasing temperature. Canopy openings in combination with higher temperatures negatively impacted all abundant dung beetle species, but especially the large species Anoplotrupes stercorosus, comprising > 90% of the total dung beetle biomass. 5. Synthesis and application: Our results suggest that dung beetles do not profit from management increasing the structural heterogeneity of forests.

Existing methods, however, are challenged by the compromise between functional imaging sensitivity (i.e., sensitivity in detecting neural responses) and spatial resolution. For example, functional ultrasound (fUS) uses native red blood cells (RBCs) as imaging targets, which offers high functional imaging sensitivity but limited spatial resolution that is confined by the diffraction limit of ultrasound. On the other hand, functional ultrasound localization microscopy (fULM) employs intravenously injected microbubble (MB) as contrast agent to achieve super-resolved spatial resolution but at the cost of functional imaging sensitivity. This study aims to address this challenge by developing a novel, MB track-based hemodynamic activity estimation method to enhance the functional imaging sensitivity of fULM. Our approach involves conducting functional correlation analysis using the MB signals acquired from the entire MB movement track rather than individual MB centroid locations, which overcomes the signal sparsity issue in fULM. To further boost the functional sensitivity of fULM, we developed a novel approach based on indwelling jugular vein catheters to achieve fULM imaging in awake mice. The in vivo imaging results demonstrate that the proposed techniques successfully enhanced the functional imaging sensitivity of fULM without compromising its high spatial resolution. In the whisker stimulation experiments, the proposed technique enabled detection of significantly activated brain regions within fewer than five stimulation cycles (5 minutes of acquisition), reducing the required time by over 50% compared to conventional fULM.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Temporal interference (TI) has emerged as a strategy for non-invasive, high-precision DBS using multiple kHz-range electric fields with a frequency difference within the range of neural activity. Here, we report the validation of neural regeneration augmentation by TI stimulation. We demonstrate that TI stimulation with a theta-band frequency difference enhances the maturation of embryonic neural progenitor cells in vitro. We then demonstrate that theta-band TI stimulation of the hippocampus enhances endogenous hippocampal neurogenesis in an in vivo mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. By uncovering frequency-specific control of stem cell fate, we propose a clinically relevant regeneration strategy which avoids pharmacological or genetic manipulation. Our results demonstrate focal, non-invasive augmentation of deep-brain neural regeneration.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Although prevalence is similar between sexes, women often experience more severe symptoms, higher rates of adverse drug effects, and reduced treatment efficacy. To investigate the underlying sex-specific AF mechanisms, we developed and validated male and female human atrial cardiomyocyte models that integrate known sex-based differences in electrophysiology and calcium (Ca2+) handling under normal sinus rhythm (nSR) and chronic AF (cAF) conditions. While the model parameterizations were based on limited human data, and the assumptions may not capture the full spectrum of clinical variability, the models reproduced key reported sex-dependent differences in human atrial cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) and Ca2+ transient (CaT) dynamics. Simulations revealed that both sexes exhibited shortened effective refractory periods and wavelengths in cAF vs. nSR. However, females were more prone to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), while males were more susceptible to AP duration (APD) and CaT amplitude (CaTAmp) alternans. Population-based modeling identified distinct parameter associations with arrhythmia mechanisms, whereby DAD vulnerability was associated with enhanced ryanodine receptor sensitivity to Ca2+ (in females), and alternans in males correlated with reduced L-type Ca2+ current maximal conductance (in males). Pharmacological simulations revealed sex-specific responses to antiarrhythmic therapies. In males, multiple drug combinations proved effective in restoring APD at 90% repolarization (APD90), CaTAmp, and reducing alternans susceptibility, whereas females responded to only one combination improving APD90 and CaTAmp but with minimal impact on DAD risk. These findings underscore the need for sex-specific therapeutic strategies and support the use of computational modeling in guiding precision medicine approaches against AF.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

BODIPY is the most prevalently used fluorescent dye for the visualization of lipid droplets (LDs) in algae; however, its limitations warrant exploration of alternatives. Here we evaluate and compare four lipophilic fluorophores (BODIPY, DAF, Cou, DPAS) for their effectiveness in staining LDs in the extremophilic green alga Chlamydomonas priscui. We assess each dye photophysical properties, synthetic accessibility, LD specificity, cellular toxicity, and suitability for microscopy and flow cytometry. All four dyes successfully stain LDs, but their performance diverges under different experimental conditions. BODIPY permits long-term incubation allowing quantification in time-course studies but exhibits poor LD specificity and high susceptibility to photobleaching. DAF enables polarity-sensitive staining but is highly toxic on prolonged exposure or during cellular stress. Cou and DPAS yield strong LD-specific signals with low cytotoxicity, making them ideal for studies involving environmental stress. However, DPAS requires room-temperature incubation, pointing toward greater potential utility for non-extremophilic algae.

J.; Scheltens, P.; de Haan, W.", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is being investigated as a clinical intervention in Alzheimers disease (AD) with the goal of reducing its neurophysiological effects (i.e. oscillatory slowing and loss of functional connectivity). However, progress is hampered by variable outcomes across studies, likely related to both methodological and individual differences. We recently described a virtual brain network simulation method for optimizing tDCS interventions and now propose a novel methodology for further personalizing this approach. While the general model of the AD brain we used for our previous study was based on an average human connectome and brain anatomy, we now created new personalized models for 10 biomarker-confirmed AD patients. We used individual, amplitude envelope correlation (AEC)-based connectivity matrices extracted from magnetoencephalography (MEG) scans and implemented individual structural MRI data for current flow modeling of the tDCS effects. We then assessed a set of previously established stimulation strategies based on their ability to restore relevant neurophysiological outcome parameters in each personalized model, while undergoing AD damage. Personalized tDCS strategies were able to delay neurophysiological deterioration, but in dissimilar ways compared to our previous results. While the general model favored posterior anodal stimulation targeting the precuneus region, the personalized models favored frontal anodal stimulation targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) region in 90% of the cases. This may be explained by higher connectivity levels of frontal regions in the personalized connectivity matrices, as anodal stimulation of highly connected regions produced more beneficial effects. In this methodological study we propose several ways to improve personalized computational tDCS stimulation prediction modeling. We conclude that connectome-guided personalization of tDCS effects lead to different strategies with potentially better intervention outcomes. For external validation of this model-guided tDCS approach, personalized and general model predictions are currently being tested and compared in a clinical tDCS-MEG trial in AD patients.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

At the apex of this hierarchy is long-term (LT) stem-like T cells with the highest capacity of persistence, repopulation and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, the pathway that establishes the hierarchy of stemness in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and its role in antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that LT stem-like differentiation and antitumor immunity of CAR T cells are dose-dependently regulated by BACH2. Pre-infusion LT stem-like CAR T cells showed epigenetic activation of BACH2 and superior antitumor response in mice and humans. After clearing tumor in vivo, LT stem-like T cells emerged as a CAR subset that transcriptionally and epigenetically upregulated BACH2 and downregulated TOX. Loss-of-function experiments revealed an essential role of BACH2 in the antitumor response of CAR T cells and the transcriptional program of LT stem-like CAR T cells. In exhaustion-prone GD2 CAR T cells with high tonic signaling, we showed that quantitative control of BACH2 protein level by a small molecule drug finetuned the degree of stemness and exhaustion in CAR T cells. Chemically inducing temporal BACH2 activation during manufacture of GD2 CAR T cells imprinted greater antitumor immunity against solid tumor after infusion.

While extensive CRISPR knockout screens have identified key genes enhancing T cell persistence, employing Sleeping Beauty (SB) insertional mutagenesis, which induces both gain- (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations via the generation of fusion transcripts with endogenous genes, may uncover additional critical factors that previous approaches have overlooked. Hence, we developed transgenic mice carrying Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible SB mutagenesis system (DiSBey) in primary T cells. Using DiSBey, we conducted screens for genetic alterations enhancing T cell persistence under chronic antigen exposure. Specifically, CD8 T cells from Dox-fed DiSBey mice were subjected to repeated anti-CD3 stimulation over 18 days to mimic chronic antigenic stimulation. We then identified SB transposon genomic insertion sites and corresponding fusion transcripts from the persistent DiSBey CD8 T cells using enhanced-specificity tagmentation sequencing and RNA-seq, respectively. Under chronic stimulation, SB-mutagenized CD8 T cells exhibited improved persistence and reduced terminal exhaustion phenotype. Across six independent screens, we identified 38 genes that were recurrently targeted by the SB transposon T2/Onc2 and differentially expressed under chronic anti-CD3 stimulation stress. Among these, T2/Onc2 insertions into Bach2 and Elmo1 were repeatedly found at the genomic level and were associated with altered nascent transcript expression. Bach2, known as a key regulator of T cell memory formation and resistance to chronic viral infection but less characterized in engineered T cells for cancer therapy, was found to enhance in vivo tumor persistence in the B16-Ova tumor model. We showed that ectopic Bach2 expression levels influence engineered T cell differentiation lineage. A Bach2low signature allowed differentiation into both KLRG1 and CD62L phenotypes, whereas Bach2high restricted differentiation predominantly to the CD62L subset. Finally, in human CART19-28{zeta} cells, BACH2 overexpression enhanced cytotoxicity and improved tumor control following chronic cancer stimulation. Controllable SB mutagenesis using DiSBey mice provides a novel platform for functional screening of genes that improve T cell therapeutic phenotypes.

This study combined CT imaging of coronary artery disease (CAD) and patient-dervied endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) transcriptional profiling to investigate potential mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis. Methods Twenty-six individuals with CT-defined CAD and eighteen non-CAD controls were included in the Discovery Cohort for bulk RNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis of ECFCs. Differential gene expression analysis was performed, and candidate genes were selected based on logFC and p-value. Candidate genes were carried forward for gene expression validation using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in a Validation Cohort. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production and mitochondrial mass were assessed using multi-colour flow cytometry. Functional validation of the top candidate was conducted in using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using loss-of-function genetic approach. Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL)-association analysis was conducted using genotype data from the BioHEART-CT cohort. Results: Pairwise analysis identified six differentially expressed protein-coding genes in CAD ECFCs: CCBE1 (Collagen and Calcium Binding EGF Domain-Containing 1), SPINT2, CRISPLD1, PIEZO2, EPB41L3, and AC005943.1. qRT-PCR in the Validation Cohort confirmed significantly higher CCBE1 expression in CAD patients. Individuals with relative CCBE1 fold change expression>10 had a 2.8-fold increase in the log-odds ratio of CT-defined CAD. CAD ECFCs displayed elevated mROS and mitochondrial mass. CCBE1 knockdown in HUVECs reduced mROS and mitochondrial mass without affecting proliferation or permeability, but shifted cells into a metabolically elevated state, marked by increased ATP production, respiration and glycolysis. CCBE1 cis-eQTLs were associated with increased odds of CAD in the BioHEART-CT cohort. Conclusions: CCBE1 expression in ECFCs was higher in patients with CT-defined CAD versus non-CAD. Quantitative assessment of transcript levels supported a causal relationship between greater CCBE1 expression and CAD burden and risk, and functional experiments on CCBE1 knockdown demonstrated improved mitochondrial function in human endothelial cells.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

A direct comparison and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt-Wls binding across the diverse Wnt family remain challenging, owing to variations in sequence length and amino acid composition among Wnt proteins, which can affect their binding affinity and trafficking efficiency via Wls. Here we combine extended atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with supervised machine learning to elucidate binding specificity among four Wnt proteins, selected based on experimental structure availability and scientific relevance. We implement a local structure alignment algorithm to enable cross-system matching and comparison of residue interactions, and we apply a two-stage clustering strategy to reduce feature redundancy and facilitate robust feature selection. After training a Random Forest classifier that achieved high predicting accuracy, our feature importance analysis reveals both previously known and novel key residue pairs responsible for distinguishing among the Wnt systems. Our findings highlight that the binding specificity across different systems arises from the distributed nature of interactions across the protein binding surface and demonstrate how interpretable machine learning can effectively uncover crucial biophysical interactions.

As a master transcription factor regulating the stress response, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is often mutated, loses negative regulation by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), becomes hyperactive, and thus causes chemo-radioresistance and poor survival in human ESCC. Our previous research identified pyrimethamine (PYR) as an NRF2 inhibitor and demonstrated that inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is the major mechanism of its action. Based on these findings, PYR has advanced into a Phase I window-of-opportunity clinical trial. In this study, using isogenic ESCC cell lines, we aimed to investigate the phenotypic consequences of NRF2 activation in ESCC cells and further elucidate the mechanism of action of PYR. While overexpression of wild-type NRF2 (NRF2WT) promoted squamous differentiation and suppressed proliferation, expression of mutant NRF2 (NRF2Mut) produced mixed effects on differentiation markers and promoted proliferation. NRF2 activation reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation, whereas PYR treatment restored chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity in NRF2Mut ESCC cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays revealed that PYR selectively enhanced the interaction between NRF2W24C and KEAP1, but not between NRF2WT and KEAP1. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed the direct binding of PYR to KEAP1 and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) showed that PYR modestly facilitated the interaction between a DLGW24C peptide and the Kelch fragment. Molecular docking suggested that PYR bound to a pocket within the Kelch domain near Arg415. In summary, NRF2 activation promotes cell proliferation and therapy resistance in ESCC in a context-dependent manner. PYR functions as a modest molecular glue that selectively restores KEAP1 binding to NRF2W24C, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for NRF2Mut ESCC.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

In silico perturbation analysis identified potent anti-cancer effects from concurrent inhibition of MAPK3 and STAT3 (GSE1323), and ELK1/ATF2 and STAT3 or MAPK14 and STAT3 (GSE8671), significantly reducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), proliferation, and inflammation while increasing apoptosis. Disease signatures and therapeutic targets were validated using patient data through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and machine learning. This integrative model recapitulates cancer biology, predicts biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and is extensible to other immunogenic cancers.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

R.; Hao, W.", "abstract": "Digital twins -- personalized, data-driven computational models -- are emerging as a powerful paradigm for representing and predicting disease trajectories at the individual level. These models have the potential to support diagnosis, monitor disease evolution, and evaluate therapeutic interventions in virtual settings in the context of clinical trials and patient care. Rigorous model assessment is thus critical for its implementation, but medical data are often sparse, noisy, and vary significantly across individuals, making it challenging to determine whether a digital twin optimized on such data is valid. In such settings, identifiability analysis becomes essential for evaluating whether model parameters can be reliably estimated and interpreted. To address this, we investigate how identifiability can support the clinical application of a computational causal digital twin model for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where data sparsity and variability are particularly pronounced. Our results show that the magnitude and distribution of biomarker data influence the parameter practical identifiability, and that constraints on the model structure and parameters can significantly affect identifiability. We also observe differences in identifiability across diagnostic groups, with several parameters showing significantly different values between individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Uncertainty quantification for identifiable parameters and their corresponding model trajectories provides visual insight into variability in disease progression and reveals mild trends related to biomarker data spread. This study represents a first step toward incorporating identifiability techniques into clinical digital twin frameworks, using a data-driven, interpretable example based on a previously published AD model.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we examine the process of PKR activation in response to an immunostimulatory MERS-CoV mutant encoding an inactive endoribonuclease U and a deletion of accessory protein NS4a. We show that PKR condenses and activates on viral dsRNA proximal to viral double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). Condensates composed of activated PKR disassociate from dsRNA and dissolve, releasing activated PKR molecules into the cytosol where they phosphorylate eIF2 to initiate the integrated stress response. MERS-CoV NS4a protein prevents PKR activation by condensing on dsRNA and occluding PKR binding. Lastly, PKR condensation coincided with its activation in response to Zika virus. These findings establish a comprehensive model for PKR activation in response to positive-strand RNA viruses that replicate within membrane-associated complexes and elucidate how MERS-CoV antagonizes this crucial antiviral pathway.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Introduction: Spaceflight-associated microgravity alters microbial physiology, raising concerns about the adaptability and pathogenicity of opportunistic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. Understanding transcriptomic responses in this context is essential for astronaut health and mission safety. Methods: Publicly available transcriptomic datasets were retrieved from the NASA GeneLab repository and analyzed in two stages. First, three experimental scenarios were compared: (1) BRIC-23 mission (in vitro Petri dish cultures aboard the ISS; 9 space vs. 9 ground), (2) SpaceX Inspiration4 mission microbiota (40 samples from 10 body sites of 4 astronauts across flight phases), and (3) Dragon capsule surface cultures (30 samples across 10 capsule zones and 3 time points). Differential expression (DESeq2), functional enrichment, heatmaps, co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and bootstrapping were applied to identify conserved transcriptomic signatures. In the second stage, five candidate genes were selected from 45 consistently altered genes across all conditions. These were validated through statistical significance (BRIC-23, p < 0.05, significant log2 fold change) and consistent presence within co-expression modules. Candidate genes were further integrated with literature-curated virulence and biofilm-associated genes to construct a functional metabolic network using pathway analysis and K-means clustering. Results: Across independent datasets, S. aureus displayed convergence in transcriptomic profiles, particularly involving genes linked to virulence, adhesion, biofilm formation, and metabolic adaptation. Network-level integration revealed metabolic reprogramming and transcriptional plasticity as conserved responses, suggesting tightly regulated adaptation rather than random changes. Discussion: The consistent identification of virulence and biofilm-associated genes across heterogeneous datasets indicates that microgravity imposes selective pressure favoring traits that enhance persistence in extreme environments. These findings support the hypothesis that S. aureus utilizes adaptive regulatory circuits to balance growth, survival, and pathogenic potential in the spaceflight niche. Conclusions: Our integrative bioinformatics approach reveals conserved adaptive strategies in S. aureus under microgravity, characterized by transcriptomic convergence and metabolic reprogramming. These insights underscore the necessity of experimental validation and phenotypic assays to assess microbial risks for astronaut health and to design countermeasures for future long-duration missions.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have provided mixed results when evaluating patterns of phylosymbiosis between marine invertebrates and marine bacteria. Here, we investigated potential animal-microbe symbioses in Pseudoalteromonas, an overlooked bacterial genus consistently identified as a core microbiome taxon in diverse invertebrates. Using a pangenomic analysis of 236 free-living and invertebrate-associated bacterial strains (including two new nematode-associated isolates generated in this study), we confirm that Pseudoalteromonas is a novel symbiont with substantial evidence of phylosymbiosis across at least three marine invertebrate phyla (e.g., Nematoda, Mollusca, and Cnidaria). Patterns of symbiosis were consistent irrespective of geography (including in Antarctica), with FISH images from nematodes indicating that bacterial symbionts form biofilms in the mouth and esophagus. The evolutionary history of Pseudoalteromonas is marked by substantial host-switching and lifestyle transitions, and host-associated genomes suggest that these bacteria are facultative symbionts involved in nutritional mutualisms. In marine environments, we hypothesize that horizontally-acquired symbionts may have co-evolved with invertebrates, using host mucus as a physical niche and food source, while providing their animal hosts with Vitamin B, amino acids, and bioavailable carbon compounds in return.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

J.; Tamim, S.; Trovao, N. S.", "abstract": "Background In August 1995, necropsies on post-weaning piglets from the CA-CART farm in the province of Cartago, Costa Rica, revealed respiratory lesions, pleuritis, peritonitis, and arthritis. Skin lesions were also observed, progressing to scabs. A subsequent outbreak in 1996 prompted antibiotic administration. Mortality analysis from 1990 to 1995 showed no significant seasonal patterns, but yearly variations were noted. Piglets born in Costa Rica from imported gilts had a higher average mortality rate (10.65%) than the 8.11% mortality rate for piglets born from non-imported gilts and sows or imported sows (p = 0.002). Methods In March 1996, serum samples were sent for potential PRRS virus (PRRSV) diagnosis, and 10 PRRSV-2 ORF5 sequences collected during a prospective study from 2019-2021 were obtained from various locations in the country. In this article, we seek to investigate the evolutionary and spatio-temporal dynamics of PRRSV-2 in Costa Rica in the context of international swine movements using the phylodynamic framework integrated with the BEAST package. Results and Discussion The phylodynamic modeling estimated at least two independent PRRSV-2 introductions into the country. The earliest introduction occurred around 1978 (95% highest posterior density interval: 1959.01-1997.54) and led to the viruses circulating in the farm 1CRC with an origin from Japan, possibly via US swine exports. A second cluster, 4CRC, subsequently emerged within Costa Rica from the earlier 1CRC lineage (1990.24; 95% HPD interval = 1976.15-2010.30). Another viral introduction from the US occurred around 1991 (95% highest posterior density interval: 1974.34-2011.35) and established the 3CRC cluster. Though the viral introduction was traced back to the US, the limited genomic surveillance of PRRSV leaves room for considering alternative origins. Conclusion Our findings provide a high-resolution model of how international swine trade drives the introduction and evolution of a major livestock pathogen, highlighting the critical need for integrating genomic surveillance into biosecurity protocols.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

To understand the ecology of this Flavobacterium-infecting phage species, we explored the host interactions of the two FLiP strains and a dsDNA Flavobacterium phage MaF61 under various conditions representing those encountered in their natural habitats in boreal lakes including different temperatures, anoxic conditions, and in the presence of different nutrients and antibiotics. While FLiP and FLiP-2 had similar virion stability outside the host, they exhibited significant differences in plaque morphology and infectivity. FLiP-2 could not replicate in the presence of ampicillin, whereas FLiP thrived even at high concentrations. Both strains of Finnlakevirus FLiP propagated better under or after stress exposure compared to MaF61. Additionally, Finnlakevirus FLiP plaques appeared far from the original infection site, particularly in response to stress, suggesting latent presence within a motile or filamentous bacterium. In conclusion, Finnlakevirus FLiP showed remarkable flexibility in host-interactions being well adapted to fluctuating conditions in boreal freshwaters.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Their molecular pathogenesis remains incompletely understood, but evidence suggests that somatic stem cells play a pivotal role in myometrial growth, whereas a genetic alteration, particularly mutations in MED12, may transform a myometrial stem cell into a tumor-initiating cell, promoting fibroid growth. In organ cultures of fibroids and myometrium, most differentiated cells degenerated by day 7, whereas stem cells remained quiescent and viable within their native niches. Notably, between days 15 and 29, hypoxia-induced activation triggered stem cell proliferation and differentiation within the ex vivo slices. Transcriptomic profiling revealed statistically significant upregulation of stemness-associated genes, including HMGA, ITG, KLF, HOX, and SOX family members, in long-term cultured slices compared with baseline tissue, and between normal and tumor cultures. Reactome pathway enrichment analysis further identified distinct metabolic, extracellular matrix remodeling, immune surveillance, angiogenic, and cell death-related programs distinguishing myometrial from leiomyoma cultures. Furthermore, previously reported gene and pathway differences between healthy and fibroid tissues were robustly confirmed, validating the culture model. In conclusion, our findings establish long-term organ culture as a powerful, physiologically relevant platform for investigating stem cell dynamics in myometrium and uterine leiomyoma.

Notably, cardiac wasting is prominent in cancer patients and cancer survivors. Cachexia studies present significant challenges due to the absence of human models and mainly short-term animal studies. To address this translational gap, we have developed a robust human-based cachexia experimental approach characterized by marked cardiac muscle wasting and contractile dysfunction, with increased expression of protein degradation markers. Using human iPSC-derived cardiac muscle, we investigated morphological, functional, and metabolic alterations in the key stages of cachexia and in the post-cachexia phase. C26 and HCT116 tumor cell lines were used to induce cachexia by two methods, pulse addition of cancer cell conditioned media or in transwell-adapted co-culture. Cachectic cardiac myocytes exhibited reduced contraction amplitude, prolonged relaxation time, and increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), as assessed by video-based and Seahorse analyses. Mechanistic investigations centered on the Atrogin-1/Calcineurin A/NFAT axis revealed this signaling pathway as a central driver of cachexia-induced cardiac atrophy. Cachectic cardiac myocytes exhibited significant upregulation of Atrogin-1, leading to a marked decrease in Calcineurin A protein levels. This, in turn, impaired nuclear translocation of NFAT, thereby suppressing its transcriptional activity and downstream cell growth signaling. These molecular changes were accompanied by increased autophagic flux, as indicated by elevated LC3BII/LC3BI ratios. Furthermore, withdrawal of cachexia-inducing stimuli followed by regular media changes for one week led to normalization of Atrogin-1 and autophagy markers; however, functional impairments and metabolic dysregulation persisted, highlighting delayed recovery. Our new findings establish the Atrogin-1/Calcineurin A/NFAT axis as a key regulatory mechanism in cardiac muscle wasting and suggest this aberrant signaling axis may serve as a targetable mechanism for treatment of cachexia-induced cardiac dysfunction.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

H.; Samadi, S.; Cardenas, P.; Pante, E.; Olu, K.", "abstract": "Porifera and Cnidaria are key phyla of marine ecosystem functioning. Slow-growing and long-lived, they show limited resilience to human disturbances and are therefore commonly used as indicator taxa of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems. Their diversity and distribution largely rely on seafloor images, but image-based identification (ID) of sponges and cnidarians beyond class/order ranks is hindered by morphological plasticity and convergence, and the need of microscopic diagnostic characters or molecular markers that are not accessible on images. Higher-rank taxonomy also poorly reflects their morphological and functional diversity. To address this issue, we applied an image-based classification relying on multiple macro-morphological traits to define statistically morpho-functional groups (MFGs) based on these traits, then used as response variables in ecological analyses, instead of taxa. We applied this framework to seamounts and island slopes in the Mozambique Channel, a poorly sampled region where taxonomic limitations are acute. We aimed to evaluate the relevance of a sponge/cnidarian morpho-functional approach to characterise their diversity and distribution at multiscales, responses to environmental gradients and structuring roles on the megabenthic community. We identified 37 sponge and 34 cnidarian MFGs with varying distributions among sites. MFGs richness and beta diversity varied among seamounts, and between seamounts and island slopes. Hydrology explained 26% of the sponge MFG spatial structure at the channel scale, while topography and substrate played a main role at a smaller scale in the northern part of the channel (17-23%). Some sponge/cnidarian MFGs co-structured with other megabenthic taxa (e.g., sea urchins, comatulids, ophiuroids). This morpho-functional approach, especially effective for sponges, allowed quantifying morphological variation of habitat-forming taxa using qualitative traits, identifying environmental drivers shaping the spatial distribution of these traits, and characterising potential biogenic habitats they provide for other megabenthic organisms. The framework proposes metrics to detect and quantify the heterogeneity and spatial variability of potentially vulnerable biogenic habitats in imagery-based studies.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

The availability of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid species of Camelina allow the evolutionary trajectory and fate of duplicated genes in the neopolyploid Camelina species to be elucidated. Here we report an improved assembly of the widely used C. sativa reference DH55 and three new genome assemblies of Camelina microcarpa; one tetraploid CN119243 (2n = 26), and two hexaploids with divergent chromosome numbers, Type 1 - CN119205 (2n=40) and Type 2 - CN120025 (2n=38). The tetraploid represents the first step in the evolutionary path to form C. sativa, while the hexaploids suggest three divergent lineages in the formation of higher ploidy Camelina species. The previously uncharacterized fourth subgenome found in C. microcarpa Type 2, although showing some homology to the C. sativa diploid progenitor genome, C. neglecta, showed numerous unique chromosomal rearrangements differentiating it from other subgenomes present in known Camelina species. Although this species was recently formed, the second subgenome showed gene expression dominance, which was in contrast to both 2n=40 Camelina species where the third subgenome was dominant. The expression dominance in Type 2 C. microcarpa contradicted the accepted two-step evolutionary process which led to the generation of related Brassicaceae species. However, the observed genome dominance in all Camelina species was negatively correlated with inter-subgenome chromatin interaction frequencies, suggesting that chromosome confirmation and proximity in the nucleus contributes to this mechanism of genome evolution. Despite the differences in genome structure, successful inter-specific hybridization provided evidence of chromosomal exchange between the divergent third sub-genomes of C. sativa and C. microcarpa Type 2, opening up a novel avenue to new diversity in the established oilseed.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we close this gap with Horizyn-1, a deep learning framework for direct reaction-to-enzyme recommendation validated through comprehensive experimental testing. Leveraging a computationally efficient combination of reaction fingerprints and protein language models, we trained Horizyn-1 on 8.9 million reaction-enzyme pairs to achieve state-of-the-art performance, recovering an enzyme with correct activity within the top 100 hits for over 75% of test reactions. We experimentally validate Horizyn-1 across three enzyme discovery scenarios: identifying enzymes for orphan reactions, predicting enzyme promiscuity for both characterized and uncharacterized enzymes, and discovering enzymes for non-natural biochemical reactions including lysine-driven transaminations that enable efficient synthesis of non-canonical amino acids. On underrepresented reaction classes, we find that fine-tuning with fewer than 10 additional reactions can dramatically improve performance. Furthermore, a logarithmic scaling of model performance with training dataset size suggests continued improvement with larger and more diverse reaction datasets.

This clinical scenario suggests that surviving drug-resistant tumor cells are dormant or slow cycling before re-entering a rapid growth phase. Remodeling of the recurrent tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to high rates of metastasis, but little is known about differences in TME remodeling before therapy and after recurrence. This study explores selection for cisplatin-resistant subpopulations of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells in culture to derive populations for modeling features of the recurrent TME. A cisplatin dose of 25 M killed approximately 80% of the cells while sparing enough cells to allow re-expansion of sufficient cell numbers for downstream experimentation. Expanded cisplatin-resistant derivatives (Cis-R A549) exhibited features of mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as cellular hypertrophy, loss of cell-cell contacts, and upregulation of alpha smooth muscle actin mRNA. In 3D culture, Cis-R A549 spheroids were loosely aggregated and dysmorphic in comparison to the compact and spherical parent A549 spheroids. The Ki67 index of Cis-R A549 in 2D and 3D spheroid culture was markedly lower than parent A549, suggesting a state of pseudo-dormancy with slow cycling. Cis-R A549 upregulated multiple genes associated with the evolution of a more aggressive TME and displayed significantly increased proangiogenic capacity in a microphysiological model of tumor angiogenesis. This study establishes a methodological framework for engineering the recurrent TME with drug-resistant cancer cell line derivatives selected via high-dose exposure in culture.

However, training generative models requires large quantities of data that captures the genetic architecture of protein function in all its complexity, but these are currently scarce. Here, we systematically mutagenized all 54 human basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domains and quantified their interactions with each other using bindingPCA, a quantitative deep mutational scanning assay. This resulted in ~2 million interaction measurements, capturing the effect of all single amino acid substitutions at each of the 35 interfacial positions. We found that mutation effects are largely additive in the vicinity of each wild-type bZIPs, but diverge across the family, indicating strong context dependency. A global additive thermodynamic model provided moderate prediction of mutation effects, while individual models per bZIP achieved higher performance, supporting a model of local simplicity and global complexity. Our results therefore suggest that the genetic architecture of protein function is more complex than previously anticipated, which could hinder predictability.

ADGRE2 has emerged as a promising AML target with broad expression in AML patient blast and leukemic stem cell-enriched populations. However, comparable expression in healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and myeloid lineages suggests a high susceptibility to on-target, off-tumor myelotoxicity with ADGRE2-targeted therapies. Guided by human genetics data identifying loss-of-function variants, we evaluated whether ADGRE2 is dispensable in hematopoietic stem cells as a protective approach for transplant-based shielding from ADGRE2-directed therapies. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and adenine base editors, we achieved high-efficiency ADGRE2 knockout (>94%) in HSPCs with corresponding protein loss without impairing cell viability, differentiation, and cytokine release in vitro, or long-term engraftment, multilineage differentiation, and persistence of gene editing in mouse xenografts. We also developed novel ADGRE2-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against AML cells, even at low antigen levels. Together, these findings establish ADGRE2 as a compelling AML target and provide a framework for hematopoietic stem cell transplant with protective gene editing to enable ADGRE2-directed immunotherapies while minimizing myelotoxicity.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

While the adverse effects of DEP exposure on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are well documented, its impact on brain health remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to investigate the neurological effects of DEP exposure and the impact of exposure cessation across different age groups. Molecular, histopathological, and behavioral markers were assessed before and after exposure to varying doses of DEP at different time intervals. Interestingly, DEP exposure induced age-dependent cellular responses in the brain, including elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased neuroinflammation, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Prolonged exposure led to pronounced vacuolization in the brains of aged flies. While cessation of DEP exposure resulted in partial recovery in young flies particularly when implemented early, aged flies exhibited limited benefit, with persistent evidence of likely irreversible brain damage. Overall, this study invites greater public awareness and careful consideration in public health policy to limit long-term DEP exposure, particularly among older individuals, and to encourage strategies that reduce potential risks to brain health associated with air pollution.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

A key aspect of this reconfiguration is the interaction of DNA nanostructures with other biomolecules or chemical stimuli such as pH and ionic conditions. Sequence-based nanostructure reconfiguration is largely achieved by strand displacement which is based on single stranded toeholds. In this work, we use sequence and temperature-controlled reassociation of one type of a DNA nanostructure into another structure. We demonstrate this strategy using the paranemic crossover (PX) DNA, a four-stranded structure with two adjacent double helical domains connected by six strand crossovers. In the presence of an anti-PX structure that is composed of strands that are each complementary to those in PX DNA, the structures reassociate at specific temperatures to form duplexes. Using the denaturing agent formamide, we decreased the temperature required for this reassociation. We extend the strategy to other polycrossover DNA molecules such as a double crossover motif (2 crossovers) and a juxtaposed DNA motif (4 crossovers), showing controlled reassociation of different DNA motifs into duplexes.

J.; Fink-Straube, C.; Weber, W.", "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors are a leading platform of in vivo gene therapy, valued for their excellent safety, broad serotype diversity, and scalable production. Targeted delivery through capsid display of ligands holds great promise, yet current retargeting strategies often rely on extensive capsid re-engineering and restrict the use of ligands incompatible with intracellular expression systems. Here, we present a modular AAV retargeting platform that, for the first time, employs the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system via genetic integration into the AAV2 capsid. SpyTag is a small peptide that forms a covalent, irreversible bond with its protein partner, SpyCatcher, allowing site-specific ligand coupling under physiological conditions. Inserting SpyTag into surface-exposed capsid sites enabled post-assembly functionalization of AAVs with SpyCatcher-fused targeting proteins. As proof-of-concept, we used SpyCatcher fusions with designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) specific for EGFR, EpCAM, and HER2. This conferred highly specific transduction of corresponding cancer cell lines with minimal off-target activity. Therapeutic potential was demonstrated by delivering a suicide gene, inducing selective cancer cell killing upon prodrug administration. This one-fits-all platform allows rapid and flexible retargeting without significantly altering the underlying vectors genome or production process. It supports the incorporation of large or complex ligands not amenable to genetic fusion and facilitates high-throughput preclinical evaluation strategies. By uniting capsid engineering with modular ligand display, our approach provides a scalable and versatile framework for precision gene delivery, broadening the applicability of rAAV in both therapeutic and discovery settings.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Several noise sources contribute to this challenge, including unrelated neuronal activity, non-brain bioelectricity, attenuation by the skull and scalp, and environmental noises. Additionally, the accumulation of noise varies significantly across subjects and recording sessions, resulting in widely diverging distributions of degraded observations. In this study, we propose modeling the noise accumulation process as a Schrodinger bridge and decoding the true signal by reversing this process. Compared to conventional guided Diffusion approach, our Schrodinger bridge approach effectively models diverse noise processes within a single framework, exhibiting greater robustness to inter-subject variability.

D.; Vindrola-Padros, B.; Clark, A.; Constant, A.", "abstract": "In this simulation study, we adopt the comprehensive neurocomputational approach of Active Inference (AIF) to illustrate some key concepts of Material Engagement Theory (MET) [1]. MET posits that craftwork does not require, or rely on, rich internal 'pre-planning', i.e., complex and highly detailed representations that occur mainly in the maker's head. Instead, the maker engages materiality through 'thinging', where the human agent (the maker) is guided by and leverages the materiality of the artefact (such as a spinning of clay or a chunk of marble). MET assigns a crucial co-participatory role to materiality, attributing agency to it. We investigate MET's claims through the widely adopted theory of AIF [2]. Our first aim is to simulate the plausibility of the (creative) thinging, adopting a simple modelling scenario. Then, we also discuss its applicability to other, more complex cases, which seem to require greater levels of 'pre-thinking' (e.g., planning, imagining and conceptualising outcomes). We highlight how these cases, too, align with the general principle of thinging. With our AIF neurocomputational understanding, we explain that even in these situations, the predictive brains involved in the creative process attempt to minimise the complexity of their internal model. The upshot of this is that, always and everywhere, our human minds engage the materiality to make the most of the characteristic dynamics of the world surrounding us - things and processes alike.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Generally, how these factors interact is not well studied, but may provide insights toward sustainable plant protection. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Ssc) is a devastating, broad host range necrotrophic pathogen with limited control options. Here, we find that necrotic Ssc lesions strongly enrich diverse bacterial taxa. Arabidopsis thaliana, like other Brassica plants including crops, produce and store large amounts of aliphatic glucosinolates (aGLS). Upon Ssc invasion and tissue damage, myrosinase enzymes transform aGLS into toxic metabolites, including aliphatic isothiocyanates (aITCs). Adapted Ssc strains can detoxify aITCs by hydrolyzing them with the enzyme SaxA, which is important for its virulence. Here, we find that this detoxification is critical for bacterial enrichment in necrotic lesions, since a SaxA-deficient strain does not alter the bacteriome. Additionally, our results suggest that both aliphatic and other GLSs likely contribute specific effects to this phenomenon. Thus, we demonstrate a mechanism in which the interaction of host and pathogen factors together shape a pathogen-associated bacteriome, providing directions to better understand interactions of host bacteria with foliar necrotic pathogens.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

For example, use of a Nano kit, lowers reagent costs by over 60% while others may only have access to entry-level sequencers such as Illumina iSeq. The extent to which these approaches would impact results and subsequently conclusions is unknown. Attempting to address this question from the literature is complicated in that various studies not only use distinct cohorts but also differ in the reagents/methodologies to used to isolate DNA and generate sequencing libraries. Hence, we sequenced a single 16S rRNA gene amplicon library derived from 60 fecal samples, collected during a dietary supplement intervention study via MiSeq, MiseqNano, and iSeq. We evaluated platform performance by several key measurements: alpha diversity, beta diversity, taxonomic composition, and differential taxonomic abundance analysis. We found that iSeq outperformed MiSeq-Nano in alpha diversity and differential abundance detection, while MiSeq-Nano provided better taxonomic resolution than iSeq. Most importantly, all platforms showed similar core biological patterns in alpha and beta diversity and overall taxonomic composition.

In this study, we characterize DB10, a planar, fluorene-based compound identified in a high-throughput screen for MRSA inhibitors. Upon UVA exposure, DB10 undergoes photoconversion from a red-colored form (DB10-R) to a yellow-colored form (DB10-Y). In comparison with DB10-R, DB10-Y exhibits reduced hydrophobicity, lower cytotoxicity, and modestly improved minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) towards a number of Gram-positive bacteria. DB10-Y intercalates into DNA and induces double-stranded breaks, yet resistance emerged only at low levels after prolonged serial passaging. To optimize this scaffold, we screened a panel of fluorene analogs and identified the photoconverting analog DB33, which in its yellow form (DB33-Y) is non-toxic and retained DNA intercalation activity. DB33-Y was effective against intracellular S. aureus in macrophages and epithelial cells and significantly reduced bacterial burden and lesion size in a murine skin infection model. DB10-Y and DB33-Y both also suppressed expression of -toxin at sub-MIC concentrations, indicating an additional anti-virulence effect.

VqmR controls traits including biofilm formation. Here, we identify repressors of DPO-VqmA-VqmR signaling. We focus on one identified repressor, the LuxT transcription factor.

Here, we report that Arabidopsis dry seed embryos accumulate the histone variant H2B.8, which contributes to higher-order chromatin organization by forming spatial clusters that structure the 3D nuclear space. H2B.8 forms heterotypic nucleosomes at euchromatic transposons and lowly expressed genes and, during imbibition, modulates the transcriptional activation of a subset of these genes. Imbibition triggers a decrease in H2B.8 transcripts and the eviction of H2B.8 proteins in a process that operates independently of DNA replication but requires protein translation and de novo transcription. Histone eviction is not limited to H2B.8 as imbibition also induces the turnover of the H3.3 histone variant, thereby initiating a broad, replication-independent chromatin reprogramming process.

Our models reveal that R1205 acts as a structural hinge: its variants disrupt polar networks in VWFs D3 domain, exposing neo-epitopes that enhance LRP1 binding ({Delta}{Delta}G up to -5.3 kcal/mol) while destabilizing the A1 domains 1-{beta}2 loop, reducing GPIb affinity (33-fold for R1205L/C). These findings explain clinical observations, p.R1205H rapid clearance yet retained platelet adhesion, and establish R1205 as a dual-functional switch regulating VWF circulatory lifetime and hemostatic activity.

Through combining the amplification power of IVT with nucleic acid LFA-based avidity effects, we develop rapid, ultra-sensitive turn-on sensors. Our sensors meet regulatory detection limits for lead, a particularly challenging metal ion contaminant, in untreated spring water samples collected from a basin that exemplifies the environmental monitoring challenges. Additionally, we show that by optimizing the IVT conditions, we can tune the limit of detection to produce an on-off signal reaching the WHO regulation threshold and others.

P.; Brown, C.; Chen, C.; Chadwick, T. A.; Jagust, W. J.; Sharon, O.", "abstract": "Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep degrades with age, and more severely in Alzheimer's disease (AD). REM sleep comprises about twenty percent of adult sleep, alternates between phasic and tonic periods, and includes delta waves (1-4Hz) in two forms: fast sawtooth waves and slower, NREM-like waves, whose expression dynamically varies across REM periods. Yet, the functional relevance of these REM sleep delta waves remains unknown. Here, using two independent cohorts, we show that aging is associated with a shift from fast sawtooth to slow NREM-like delta waves, particularly during phasic REM sleep, a period typically marked by high cortical activation. Beyond chronological age, this shift is associated with amyloid-beta and tau burden, suggesting that AD pathology disrupts REM-specific oscillatory patterns. Furthermore, this shift in REM oscillations is linked to impaired overnight memory consolidation, independent of NREM sleep quality. Moreover, variation in ApoE alleles, a major genetic risk factor for AD, was independently associated with a reduction in fast sawtooth wave density, thereby linking a genetic predisposition for AD to these specific REM microstructural changes. These findings identify a novel signature of memory decline in aging and implicate REM sleep as a distinct vulnerable substrate through which AD pathology may impair brain function.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

CHIKV E2 gene codes for spike protein E2, essential for virus-host interactions and thus serves as a potential vaccine candidate. We expressed a full-length E2 (S27 African prototype) in both E. coli and Nicotiana tabacum, which triggered an immune response in BALB/c mice. First, E2 was computationally analyzed for PTM patterns and prediction of B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Next, molecular docking of epitopes with MHCs (Class I and II) revealed high affinity, confirmed by Molecular Dynamics Simulation. Then, the chemically synthesized E2-6xHis tag was cloned and expressed in both E. coli and N. tabacum under T7 and CaMV promoters, respectively. E2 was cloned into the pUC57 vector (E. coli) and expressed using the pET28a(+) vector in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, followed by cloning into the pCAMBIA1302 vector and transformation into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. RT-PCR and confocal visualization confirmed the formation of E2 transcripts. Recombinant E2 was purified on Ni-NTA columns and visualized as a protein of ~49 kDa on SDS PAGE. Finally, E2 was injected into BALB/c mice; neutralizing antibodies, including IgG, were detected as positive in the indirect ELISA, with the highest levels observed at 3 days post-infiltration (3 dpi). Western blot also confirmed E2 expression in E coli and tobacco, and induction of E2-specific antibodies in BALB/c mice.

Human nephrogenesis is complete at 34-36 weeks gestation, with 60% of nephrons forming during the third trimester through lateral branch nephrogenesis (LBN). We hypothesized that a differentiated but dividing population of nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) would contribute to the amplification of nephrons in late gestation. Methods: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was performed on cortically-enriched fetal rhesus kidneys (n=9) from late second trimester and third trimester during LBN. This data was integrated with publicly available human scRNA-seq datasets from 8-18 weeks gestation kidneys (n=8) using state-of-the-art bioinformatics pipelines. Differentially expressed genes and ligand-receptor interactions were assessed and validated using RNAScopeTM on human and rhesus archival tissue. Results: scRNA-Seq of 64,782 rhesus cells revealed 37 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, including 7,879 rhesus NPCs. Pseudotime analyses identified a late gestation-specific lineage branch of differentiated NPC in rhesus that was not observed in mid-gestation humans. Differential expression analyses identified increased SFRP1, FZD4, and TLE2 and decreased FZD7, SHISA2, SHISA3, and TLE4 within the late-gestation rhesus NPC compared to mid-gestation human NPC and increased SEMA3D within the rhesus UB tip, suggesting a compositional shift in WNT and SEMA signaling components within the naive NPC population during LBN. Conclusion: The rhesus macaque uniquely enables molecular studies of late-gestation primate nephrogenesis. Our study suggests the hypothesis that a transitional state of self-renewing NPC supported by compositional shifts in key pathways may underlie the switch from branching phase nephrogenesis to lateral branch nephrogenesis and support ongoing nephron formation in late gestation.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Violations of this assumption have been shown to affect the conclusions from analyses of genetic variation. However, there is currently a lack of statistical methods to assess whether this phenomenon occurs with sufficient frequency and magnitude to warrant concern. Here, we introduce such techniques and apply them to cases where genetically encoded changes to mutation are expected to induce neutral mutation disequilibrium (NMD) across an entire genome (loss of the hypermutable base 5-methyl-cytosine in Drosophila melanogaster), or in a limited genomic region (translocation of the Fxy gene to the pseudo-autosomal region in Mus musculus). We find that the proportion of 9,237 genes in NMD in the D. melanogaster genome (~0.81) is markedly elevated compared to its sister taxa D. simulans (~0.31) which retains 5-methyl-cytosine. We further establish that the translocation of Fxy has resulted in ~3x increase in the magnitude of NMD. These empirical case studies validate the robustness of our methods. Applying the methods to human evolution, from 613 genes, we estimated the proportion of NMD for the exons as ~0.64 and introns as ~0.22. These results establish NMD as a common phenomenon and suggest that conclusions from studies that assumed equilibrium in order to understand biological mechanisms may misattribute to biology what should be credited to measurement error.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we found that the K19A variant binds most strongly to both non-functionalized and carboxylate-functionalized PSNPs. ITC thermograms indicate that K19A forms a stable monolayer, while other variants exhibit multilayer adsorption. We hypothesize that removing lysine at position 19 creates a flatter, more neutral interaction surface that promotes efficient initial binding. Fluorescence denaturation experiments show that PSNPs destabilize GB3 protein variants, and binding correlates strongly with protein unfolding (r = 0.82, p < 0.01 for COOH-PSNPs and r = 0.76, p < 0.03 for non-functionalized PSNPs).

Computational approaches designed to detect introgression either employ full likelihood, including Bayesian frameworks, to directly estimate phylogenetic networks or utilize summary statistics derived directly from locus sequence alignments or estimated gene trees to map gene flow events onto the species tree. Many current methods currently have major shortcomings. The computationally scalable summary statistics and pseudo-likelihood-based techniques may provide erroneous results in the presence of so-called ghost introgression and rate variation between lineages. On the other hand, full likelihood methods are more accurate, but are not computationally tractable for large phylogenomic datasets. Here, we develop a novel summary statistic, based on tree heights of different gene tree topologies to reliably distinguish between sampled and ghost introgression events. We implemented this approach in the publicly accessible bioinformatic pipeline GhostParser. We demonstrate that GhostParser can accurately distinguish between scenarios of sampled and ghost introgression, even in the presence of rate variation between lineages. Our methodology concurs in accuracy with the full likelihood software Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) on empirical datasets, and outperforms BPP in our simulation conditions, both in a small fraction of the computational time.

In the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BA), the oscillation frequency is accelerated in retrieval of conditioned fear memory. The amygdala receives sensory inputs from associated cortex and thalamus. Therefore, we tried to apply the bimodal sensory stimulation at slow frequency (5 Hz, functional frequency in behavioral context) for the entrainment of the BA oscillation. Young adult rats (P24-30) were stimulated by LED illuminator and acoustic speaker at 1 or 5 Hz for 1 hour. Immediately after the stimulus was finished, BA slices were prepared and whole-cell recording was applied to projection neuron. The slow (0.5-2 Hz) rhythmic IPSCs obtained from the pyramidal neuron was accelerated at ~4 Hz by synchronous opto-acoustic stimulation at 5 Hz. However, the frequency of the neuron at the later recording did not change in the same slice, suggesting that this induced entrainment is transient and reversible phenomenon. As a result, the power distribution was shifted from 0.1-2 to 2-6 Hz by synchronous bimodal 5 Hz stimulation. The regularity of the interval between IPSCs, quantified by rhythm index and the concentration of power around peak frequency in the power spectrum, was not changed by rhythmic sensory stimulation.

To overcome this limitation, here we develop a new statistical framework to measure and interpret individual differences in functional brain representations. We apply this framework to characterize how different individuals represent the same concepts. Twenty-four participants listened to narrative stories while their brain activity was measured with functional MRI (fMRI). Encoding models were used to recover how hundreds of concepts were represented in each person's brain. Despite listening to identical stories, participants showed systematic individual differences in conceptual representations. These differences reveal person-specific biases in how concepts are represented in the brain. Individual variability was highest in regions that represent social information. Because these regions are thought to integrate sensory information with personal beliefs and experiences, the observed individual differences may reflect cognitive traits unique to each person.

While a class of neurons on average innervates its entire surroundings, each individual one can only cover a small part of the space.

We hypothesized that individuals adaptively use generalization by continuously updating their beliefs about the credibility of the feature-based reward generalization model at each state. Our data showed that participants used generalization more when the novel environment remained consistent with the previously learned monotonic association between feature and reward, suggesting efficient utilization of prior knowledge. Against other accounts, we found that individuals incorporated an arbitration mechanism between feature-based value generalization and model-based learning based on volatility tracking. Notably, our suggested model captured differential impacts of generalization dependent on the context-volatility, such that individuals who were biased the most toward generalization showed the lowest learning errors when the value of stimuli are generalized along the recognizable feature, but showed the highest errors in a volatile environment.

To determine the computational nature of these BG-PFC inputs in cognition, we tested three alternative connectivity configurations (Direct, Modulatory, and Mixed) within a large-scale cognitive architecture. This architecture, the Common Model of Cognition, has been independently validated using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The Direct model reflected the standard CMC configuration, featuring a bidirectional, direct connection between the BG and PFC modules. The Modulatory model removed this direct link, instead incorporating a unidirectional connection from the PFC to the BG and two modulatory pathways from the BG to the PFC that passed through other cortical modules. The Mixed model included both direct and modulatory connections. Using fMRI data from 200 HCP participants performing six cognitive tasks and one resting-state session, we applied Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to estimate and compare the influence of these different BG-PFC connectivity patterns. Here, we show that for each of the six cognitive tasks and resting state, the Mixed model consistently outperformed the Direct and Modulatory models. The next best model depended on the specific cognitive task, suggesting the ability for the BG to flexibly adapt to various task demands. Taken together, the current data provide evidence for a likely set of core computations that the BG uses to differentially regulate cortical activity.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}

L.; Anderson, A. J.; Fernandino, L.", "abstract": "Events and objects are two fundamental ways in which humans conceptualize their experience of the world. Despite the significance of this distinction for human cognition, it remains unclear whether the neural representations of object and event concepts are categorically distinct or, instead, can be explained in terms of a shared representational code. We investigated this question by analyzing fMRI data acquired from human participants (males and females) while they rated their familiarity with the meanings of individual words (all nouns) denoting object and event concepts. Multivoxel pattern analyses indicated that both categories of lexical concepts are represented in overlapping fashion throughout the association cortex, even in the areas that showed the strongest selectivity for one or the other type in univariate contrasts. Crucially, in these areas, a feature-based model trained on neural responses to individual event concepts successfully decoded object concepts from their corresponding activation patterns (and vice versa), showing that these two categories share a common representational code. This code was effectively modeled by a set of experiential feature ratings, which also accounted for the mean activation differences between these two categories. These results indicate that neuroanatomical dissociations between events and objects emerge from quantitative differences in the cortical distribution of more fundamental features of experience. Characterizing this representational code is an important step in the development of theory-driven brain-computer interface technologies capable of decoding conceptual content directly from brain activity.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": ""}
