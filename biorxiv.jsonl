Biological systems lack a plausible mechanism to implement the backpropagation approach, a method that underlies much of the dramatic progress in artificial intelligence. Here, we use automated connectomic analysis to show that the synaptic architecture of songbird basal ganglia (Area X) supports local credit assignment using a variant of a node perturbation algorithm proposed in a model of reinforcement learning. Using two volume electron microscopy (vEM) datasets, we find that key predictions of the model hold true: axons that encode exploratory variability terminate predominantly on dendritic shafts, while axons that encode song timing (context) terminate predominantly on spines. Based on the detailed EM data, we then built a biophysical model of reinforcement learning that suggests that the synaptic dichotomy between variability and context encoding axons facilitates efficient learning. In combination, these findings provide strong evidence for a general, biologically plausible credit assignment model in vertebrate basal ganglia learning.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

We compared the relative performance of a deep learning approach, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN), and outline analyses via geometric morphometrics using elliptical Fourier transforms (EFT) at identifying pairs of plant taxa. We used their seeds and fruit stones that are the most abundant organs in archaeobotanical assemblages, and whose morphological identification, chiefly between wild and domesticated types, allows to document their domestication and biogeographical history. We used existing modern datasets of four plant taxa (barley, olive, date palm and grapevine) corresponding to photographs of two orthogonal views of their seeds that were analysed separately to offer a larger spectrum of shape diversity. Sample sizes ranged from 473 to 1,769 seeds per class, which constitute a relatively small dataset for training CNNs models yet typical within archaeobotanical research. On these eight datasets, we compared the performance of CNN and EFT coupled with linear discriminant analyses. Our objectives were twofold: i) to test whether CNN can beat geometric morphometrics in taxonomic identification and if so, ii) to test which minimal sample size is required. We ran simulations on the full datasets and also on subsets, starting from 50 images in each binary class. For the CNN network, we deliberately used a candid approach relying on pre-parameterised VGG19 network. For EFT, we used a state-of-the art morphometrical pipeline. The main difference rests in the data used by each model: our CNN used bare photographs where EFT used outline coordinates. This \"pre-distilled\" geometrical description of seed outlines is often the most time-consuming part of morphometric studies. Results show that our CNN beats EFT in most cases, even for very small datasets. We finally discuss the potential of CNNs for archaeobotany, and how bioarchaeological studies could embrace both approaches, used in a complementary way, to better assess and understand the past history of species.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

T.; Soma, M.", "abstract": "Songs play an important role in mate choice for many bird species. Females of some species prefer mates with song characteristics such as familiarity, complexity, or specific temporal or note features. Different song characteristics may provide distinct information about the birds that produced those songs. For example, familiarity may be a signal of local adaptation, locally relevant information or learned behaviours, or genetic compatibility, while song complexity may be a signal of overall genetic quality. However, how song characteristics combine to affect female preferences remains poorly understood. We examined female preference for song familiarity and complexity using the Java sparrow (Padda oryzivora) as a model species. Females were presented with pairs of song stimuli; familiar and unfamiliar songs in familiarity trials, and songs differing in note repertoire or linearity in complexity trials. Females preferred their fathers' songs over unfamiliar songs, but we did not find strong evidence that females generalized this preference to other socially related individuals. Females also preferred complex songs, specifically those with larger note repertoires and with lower linearity, even when controlling for familiarity. Our results suggest that female song preference in Java sparrows is multi-faceted, with different song characteristics potentially offering different information to choosy females.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

We recorded single units in freely moving mice using two complementary approaches: (i) chronic tetrodes targeting CA1 and dorsal SUB, and (ii) 64-channel linear silicon probes targeting dorsal SUB. In addition to place cells, boundary-vector cells (BVC) and corner cells (CC), we identified a subset of SUB neurons that exhibited spatially periodic (grid-like) firing. This phenomenon was replicated across recording technologies indicating that periodic coding is a consistent feature of mouse subiculum. Compared with CA1 place cells, SUB spatial neurons showed lower spatial information and reduced within-session stability, suggesting distinct coding regimes across these hippocampal subregions. Sampling along the proximodistal axis with probe arrays further revealed that burst propensity correlated positively with spatial information at more distal recording sites, consistent with known physiological gradients in subiculum and echoing relationships seen in CA1. Together, these results expand the repertoire of identified spatial codes in SUB and support a view in which subiculum contributes to geometry and periodicity-based representations that complement CA1 and entorhinal spatial representation, thus, shaping downstream computations in cortico-subcortical circuits", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Previous studies, mainly focused on North America, provided mixed results. We evaluated the effects of wolf lethal removals on the distribution of attack intensities in the French Alps between 2011 and 2020, using a Before After Control-Impact approach with retrospective data. We built an original framework combining both continuous spatial and temporal scales and a 3D kernel estimation. We compared the attack intensities observed before and after the legal killings of wolves on a period of 90 days and on a range of 10 km, and with control situations where no removal occurred. The analysis was corrected for the presence of livestock. A moderate decrease of attack intensity was the most common outcome after the lethal removal of a single wolf. This reduction was greatly amplified when removing two or three wolves. The scale of analysis also modulated this general pattern, with decreases being generally amplified at a small spatio-temporal range. Contextual factors (e.g., geographical or seasonal variations) could also lead to deviations from this general pattern. Overall, between 2011 and 2020, lethal control of wolves in France generally contributed to reduce livestock attacks, but mainly locally and to a minor extent. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for scale in such assessments and suggest that the evaluation of the effectiveness of lethal removals in reducing livestock predation might be more relevant in a local context. As a next step, we recommend to move forward from patterns to mechanisms by linking the effects of lethal control on wolves to their effects on attacks through analysis of fine-scaled data on wolves and livestock.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

While both natural and synthetic genetic oscillators have been extensively studied, oscillatory behaviors in cells can also emerge without dedicated genetic circuits. In earlier work, we uncovered sustained oscillations in phenotypic switching across diverse cellular systems and gene circuits, occurring spontaneously, without external forcing and linked them to the induction of slow-growing phenotypes. In this study, we identify the conditions that give rise to such intrinsic phenotypic instabilities, leading to population-level oscillations. We develop and analytically solve a simplified mathematical model of a stress-induced phenotype, mapping the range of continuous culture conditions that trigger oscillatory gene expression. This instability range, predicted by the model, was experimentally validated in Bacillus subtilis cultures. Our findings reveal that oscillations can arise in the complete absence of genetic oscillators or external perturbations. Although demonstrated here for a stress response in continuous culture, this phenomenon may occur in any long-term cultivation where environmental feedback links an inducer to the cellular system, broadening the landscape of possible oscillatory behaviors in microbiology and synthetic biology.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

This imbalance is introduced by the transcriptional repression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of sphingomyelin by Snail.

This prospective descriptive cross-sectional study aimed to describe the CT and histopathological findings of TMJ OA concerning horse age, assess the correlation between the CT and histopathological findings, and evaluate the accuracy of CT-based diagnosis of TMJ OA. CT images and tissue samples from 41 heads (82 TMJs) were independently and simultaneously reviewed by two observers. Descriptive statistics on both findings, their age- and TMJ OA-related frequency distribution, and the accuracy of TMJ OA diagnosis were calculated. Based on CT findings, TMJ OA was recognized in 50% of joints in horses aged 1-4 years and 100% in horses aged 5-15 and >15 years. However, based on histopathological findings, TMJ OA was confirmed in 18% of joints in horses aged 1-4 years, 63% in horses aged 5-15 years, and 83% in horses >15 years. The occurrence of both findings differed among horses of different ages. Consequently, the CT-based diagnosis of TMJ OA showed moderate accuracy with a 0.79 sensitivity and 0.50 specificity. However, accuracy metrics also differed among horses of different ages. Equine TMJ may undergo both age- and disease-related remodeling, detectable through CT and histopathology. However, the sensitivity and specificity of CT-based TMJ OA diagnosis may be affected by the consideration of 'CT anatomical variations'.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we performed a phylogeny-guided plastid genome-resolved metagenomic survey of Tara Oceans expeditions. We present a curated resource of 660 new non-redundant plastid genomes of environmental pelagic algae. This catalogue vastly expands the plastid genome diversity within major algal groups, often corresponding to algae without closely related reference genomes. Notably, we recovered four plastid genomes, including one near complete, forming a deep-branching plastid lineage of nano-size algae that we informally named leptophytes. This group is globally distributed and generally rare, although it can reach relatively high abundance at least in the Arctic. A mitochondrial contig including 62 genes showing strong read coverage correlation with leptophytes was also recovered from these Arctic samples and assigned to this group. Leptophytes encompass the enigmatic marine plastid group DPL2, one of the very few known plastid groups not clearly belonging to any major algal groups and for which only 16S rDNA amplicon data is available. Extensive gene content comparison and organellar phylogenomics support the view that leptophytes are sister to haptophytes, and raise the intriguing possibility that cryptophytes acquired their plastids from haptophytes. Collectively, our study demonstrates that metagenomics can reveal currently hidden diversity of organellar genomes, and shows the importance of including this diversity to improve models for plastid evolution.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Although essential regulators of cytokinesis have been identified through previous genetic screens, the molecular mechanisms underlying these spatial controls and the mechanical resilience of cytokinesis remain elusive. To identify cytokinesis regulators involved in these processes, we performed a high-throughput RNAi screen using a gain-of-function mutant of actin that exhibits ectopic cortical contraction and abnormal spatial control of cytokinesis in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. We obtained a list of early embryonic genes that suppress embryonic lethality in an act-2 mutant background. Two parallel secondary screens of candidate genes were conducted. The first secondary screen in a wild-type background identified 69 candidate genes regulating spatial cytokinesis control, asymmetric ring closure, positioning, and rotation, during early embryogenesis.

While heat hormesis is widely observed, much remains to be learned about its molecular basis. This study bridges a critical knowledge gap through a comprehensive multiomic analysis, providing key insights into the transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility landscapes throughout a heat hormesis regimen in C. elegans. We uncover highly dynamic, dose-dependent molecular responses to heat stress and reveal that while most initial molecular changes induced by mild stress revert to baseline, key differences emerge in response to subsequent heat shock challenge that likely contribute to physiological benefits. We further demonstrate that heat hormesis extends lifespan specifically in wild-type animals, but not in germlineless mutants, likely due to transient disruption of germline activities during mild heat exposure, which appears sufficient to trigger pro-longevity mechanisms. This finding points to tissue-specific responses in mediating the physiological outcomes of heat hormesis. Importantly, we identify several highly conserved regulators of heat hormesis that likely orchestrate gene expression to enhance stress resilience. Among these regulators, some (MARS-1/MARS1, SNPC-4/SNAPc, FOS-1/c-Fos) are broadly required for heat hormesis-induced benefits, whereas others (ELT-2/GATA4, DPY-27/SMC4) are uniquely important in specific genetic backgrounds.

In such landscapes, ability to track changing conditions is limited, threatening narrowly distributed species. As a mountain biodiversity hotspot in southwestern Europe, the Pyrenees harbors many such species, making it a key case study for climate vulnerability assessments. This study implements a bioclimatic niche modeling pipeline to evaluate climate change impact on endemic Pyrenean plant species by 2100. Objectives are to (i) map current bioclimatic niche suitability, (ii) forecast its future spatial dynamics, and (iii) identify potential climate refugia for conservation. Species occurrences were combined with 19 bioclimatic variables (1x1 km resolution) to characterize bioclimatic niche suitability, using an ensemble modeling approach integrating five algorithms (MaxEnt, Generalized Linear Model, Generalized Additive Model, Gradient Boosting Machine, and Random Forest). Their future spatiotemporal dynamics were projected under four climate scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic pathways 126, 245, 370, 585) for four successive periods spanning 2021 to 2100. By 2100, 69% of endemic species are projected to lose over 75% of their bioclimatic niche, and half to face complete losses under high-emission scenarios. Only two species may gain suitable areas, highlighting the need for species-specific conservation strategies. Bioclimatic niches are projected to shift by ~180 m upslope and ~3 km in latitude on average, with areas of highest multi-species suitability, referred to as bioclimatic hotspots, becoming restricted to elevation above 2000 m. These trends intensify after 2041-2060 period, reflecting escalating climate pressures as the century progresses. Our findings highlight the profound threat climate change may pose to endemic Pyrenean flora, with widespread bioclimatic niche losses projected by the century's end and high elevation refugia emerging as key conservation priorities. Anticipating these shifts and integrating them into conservation planning will be crucial to mitigating high-elevation biodiversity loss in a rapidly changing world.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Meanwhile, the epileptogenic zone (EZ) shows localized bistability in {beta}-{gamma} band (15-200 Hz) neuronal oscillations--indicating a catastrophic shift toward seizure. We aim to clarify the mechanistic link between {delta}-band synchrony and {beta}-{gamma} band bistability in epilepsy. Methods: We studied a cohort of fourteen patients with Sleep Hypermotor Epilepsy (22.3 {+/-} 10.8 years old; 7 males). 7-9-hour stereo-EEG sleep recordings were segmented into 10-minute of uninterrupted, interictal N2 and N3 epochs, and phase synchrony, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), and bistability were assessed. Canonical correlation was examined to answer whether PAC links {delta}-phase to {beta}-{gamma} bistability. Results: Compared to non-EZ, the EZ exhibited larger 15-200 Hz bistability along with stronger 2-8 Hz and 15-100 Hz synchrony throughout N2 and N3. Compared to N3, N2 showed stronger PAC between 2-30 Hz phases in the non-EZ and 5-150 Hz amplitudes in the EZ. Canonical correlations between {delta}-phase modulated PAC and both bistability and synchrony were identified during N2 (r = 0.86 and 0.82) and N3 (r = 0.84 and 0.80), with the strongest contributors being 2-4 Hz synchrony and bistability in 2-4 Hz and 15-200 Hz bands. Correlations between interictal spikes and canonical covariates of bistability and PAC (r2 = 0.62 for N2 and 0.56 for N3) validated their relevance to epileptogenicity. Significance: {delta}-band synchrony and {beta}-{gamma} band bistability are not isolated epileptogenic mechanisms but likely act synergistically, playing a pivotal role in seizure generation through the coupling of {delta} phases and {beta}-{gamma} amplitudes across large networks, with significant contributions from non-epileptogenic tissues.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Previously, we showed that human SMC5/6 is regulated by two mutually exclusive subcomplexes: SIMC1-SLF2 and SLF1/2, the counterparts of yeast Nse5/6 (Oravcova, eLife, 2022). Notably, only SIMC1-SLF2 recruits SMC5/6 to SV40 Large T antigen (LT) foci in PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs), suggesting that these regulatory subcomplexes direct distinct roles of SMC5/6 on chromosomal versus ecDNA. However, their roles in plasmid repression remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SMC5/6-mediated repression of plasmid transcription depends exclusively on SIMC1-SLF2, whereas SLF1/2 is dispensable. Reinforcing its specialized role in ecDNA suppression, SIMC1-SLF2 does not participate in SMC5/6 recruitment to chromosomal DNA lesions. We further show that plasmid silencing requires a conserved interaction between SIMC1-SLF2 and SMC6, mirroring the functional relationship observed between yeast Nse5/6 and Smc6. As for viral silencing, plasmid repression depends on the SUMO pathway; however, unlike viral silencing, it does not require PML NBs. Additionally, we find that LT interacts with SMC5/6 and increases plasmid transcription to levels observed in SIMC1-SLF2-deficient cells; echoing the antagonistic roles of HBx (HBV) and Vpr (HIV-1) in viral genome repression.

However, previous studies have shown that diffusion-weighted fMRI (dfMRI), from which ADC-fMRI derives, is influenced by BOLD effects, leading to a concern that the dfMRI contrast is still rooted in neurovascular rather than neuromorphological coupling. Mitigation strategies have been proposed to remove vascular contributions while retaining neuromorphological coupling, by: i) analysing ADC timecourses calculated from two interleaved diffusion-weightings, known as ADC-fMRI; ii) using b-values of at least 200 s mm-2; and iii) using a sequence compensated for cross-terms with fluctuating background field gradients associated with blood oxygenation. Respiration-induced haemodynamic fluctuations, which are dissociated from neural activity, are an excellent test-bed for the robustness of ADC-fMRI to vascular contributions. In this study, we investigate the association between end-tidal CO2 and ADC-fMRI, in comparison with dfMRI and BOLD, in both breath-hold and resting-state paradigms in the human brain. We confirm a strong dependence of the BOLD signal on respiration, and a pattern of delayed haemodynamic response in white matter. While dfMRI mitigates much of the vascular contribution, it retains some association with respiration, as expected. Conversely, ADC-fMRI is mostly unaffected by vascular contribution, exhibiting minimal correlation between expired CO2 and ADC timeseries, as well as low inter- and intra-subject reproducibility in correlation maps. These findings validate ADC-fMRI as a predominantly non-vascular contrast sensitive to microstructural dynamics, enabling whole-brain functional imaging unconstrained by vascular confounds.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

B.; Fortuna, R.; DuVal, D.; Paquet, M.; Doutrelant, C.", "abstract": "Infanticide, the killing of dependent young by adult conspecifics, is an extreme form of conflict that remains poorly understood. Previous studies suggest that it is associated with reproductive benefits, either by making breeders newly available for reproduction or by increasing offspring care and reducing competition for resources. In addition, infanticide may result from a reproductive trade-off, where parents kill their offspring if environmental conditions compromise their reproductive value. Here, we combine video, genetic and individual-level reproductive data collected over 12 years to describe infanticide in a highly social, cooperative bird, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius and to establish whether direct reproductive benefits or life-history trade-offs are possible motivators for this behaviour. We documented 50 cases of infanticide and identified 27 aggressors with known histories. These were mostly born outside the colonies where they committed infanticide (63%) and there was a bias towards younger individuals. Aggressors were usually not part of the victim's breeding group (74%), but in two cases infanticide was committed by the breeding female, and in five by helpers. In most cases, aggressors were not reproducing at the time of the infanticide, were not recorded mating with any of the breeders from the attacked nest, nor occupied the nest from where the chicks were evicted. Only eight of the known aggressors were confirmed as breeders after the attacks, and these mostly reproduced at the colony where the attacks were committed. Overall, we found no evidence for direct reproductive benefits of infanticide in sociable weavers. However, the younger age of aggressors, lack of genetic relatedness to the victims and future breeding at the colony suggest that competition between breeding groups, and hence indirect reproductive benefits, could provide motivation for infanticide in this population. Additional work over longer periods is needed to identify these possible indirect fitness benefits of infanticide.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) show extensive compartmentalization, thus understanding each compartment - from the peripheral to central terminals - is key to this effort. To systematically profile this spatial complexity, we generated a TurboIDfl/fl transgenic mouse line (ROSA26em1(TurboID)Bros), enabling targeted proximity labelling and deep proteomic profiling of DRG neuron compartments via AdvillinCre. Our data reveal distinct proteomic signatures across neuronal compartments that reflect specialized neuronal functions. We provide proteomic insights into previously inaccessible nerve terminals both in the periphery (innervating the skin) and in the spinal cord. Further, using a DRG explant model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), we uncovered novel and discrete proteome changes, highlighting neuronal vulnerability.

F.", "abstract": "In Bayesian phylodynamics, we jointly reconstruct the posterior distribution of timed phylogenetic trees, evolutionary and population dynamic parameters. Most approaches in the field use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for inference. Inferring timed phylogenetic trees using MCMC relies on a set of proposal distributions -- operators -- to explore different phylogenetic tree topologies, node ranks, and heights. However, inefficiencies in these proposal distributions limit the speed and scale with which phylodynamic analyses can be performed. Here, we introduce two classes of operators that allow scaling of phylodynamic analyses by reducing the time needed to reach convergence. We propose an improved proposal distribution to scale trees based on the intervals between consecutive nodes in the tree, and a set of operators informed by a pseudo parsimony score to explore different tree topologies. Contrary to already existing operators that make large changes to areas of the tree with no mutations at all, our new parsimony-focused operators target areas of the tree with many mutations. We first demonstrate the correctness of these proposal distributions using a well-calibrated simulation study. We then demonstrate the improvements of using the updated proposal distributions using a number of large real-world datasets, showing a substantial increase in effective sample size per hour across viral datasets as well as a reduction in the number of samples required for the MCMC chain to reach stationarity. Finally, we apply the operators to a 10,000-sequence H3N2 dataset including phylogeography and finish the analysis within two weeks. The operators are implemented in the TargetedBeast package, which is available as an open-source package for BEAST2 and a user-friendly graphical user interface.

M.", "abstract": "Genetic interactions, where the combined effect of perturbing two genes leads to a phenotype that deviates from the expectation based on the effects of the individual perturbations, often provide important information about the functional architecture of biological systems. These interactions are commonly classified as negative or positive based on whether the phenotype of the double mutant is less than or greater than what would be expected based on the single mutant effects. When the trait in question is fitness, systematic studies of pairwise deletions have shown that negative interactions typically link genes with similar functional annotations, while positive interactions typically link genes that are less obviously related and thus often viewed as less informative. However, research in the sociology of science suggests that transformative discoveries often arise from unexpected, cross-domain linkages. To evaluate these competing perspectives, we integrated large-scale genetic interaction data in yeast with literature annotations from the Saccharomyces Genome Database and citation data from iCite. We found that positive genetic interactions are associated with greater scientific impact, as measured by citation metrics, contrary to prevailing assumptions. Nevertheless, despite their greater impact, positive interactions are significantly underrepresented in the scientific literature, suggesting they are frequently overlooked. These findings reveal the underappreciated value of positive genetic interactions and demonstrate the potential of applying sociology-of-science insights to foster biological innovation.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

We propose that sensory systems are modulated in anticipation of systematic changes in stimulus statistics caused by locomotion to maintain an accurate and efficient sensory code across behavioral states. Model neurons optimized to encode stimuli recorded during movement in natural environments predict and reproduce a broad spectrum of experimental observations. The proposed, simple principle of anticipatory modulation reconciles the diversity of ways in which locomotion modulates visual coding in different animal species.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

To test this, we fine-tune monolingual and multilingual language models using brain activity recorded while bilingual participants read stories in English and Chinese. We then evaluate how well these representations generalize to the bilingual participants' first language, their second language, and several other languages that the participants are not fluent in. We assess the fine-tuned language models on brain encoding performance and downstream NLP tasks. Our results show that bilingual brain-informed fine-tuned language models outperform their vanilla (pretrained) counterparts in both brain encoding performance and most downstream NLP tasks across multiple languages.

Our analysis revealed a striking evolutionary paradox centered on a single strain isolated from Indian bekang. Core-genome phylogenetic analysis places this bekang strain clearly outside the tight natto clade, with a Nepalese kinema strainbeing its closest systematic neighbor. In stark contrast, quantitative analysis of accessory gene profiles revealed this single bekang strain is the functional nearest neighbor to the natto clade, sharing a highly conserved accessory gene repertoire. This shared profile defines a \"natto-type\" adaptive strategy (the \"broad-sense natto group,\" n=27), separating it from other related strains.

How this antagonism is established, however, remains an open question. Here, we examined the impacts of DNA methylation on both the intrinsic stability of H2A.Z nucleosomes and chaperone-mediated H2A.Z deposition. Cryo-EM and endonuclease accessibility analyses show that H2A.Z nucleosomes with methylated DNA are more open and accessible compared to their unmethylated counterparts. In Xenopus laevis, H2A.Z preferentially associates with unmethylated DNA in both the fibroblast cell line XTC-2 and sperm pronuclei formed in the transcriptionally silent egg extract. The proportion of H2A.Z that colocalizes with methylated DNA, however, is higher in sperm pronuclei than in XTC-2. By monitoring nucleosome assembly on synthetic DNA constructs in Xenopus egg extracts, we find that the H2A.Z bias for unmethylated substrates is dependent on the SRCAP complex, the major H2A.Z deposition chaperone. Consistently, recruitment of the SRCAP complex to DNA is suppressed by DNA methylation. Altogether, we propose that the SRCAP complex is the major determinant for preferential H2A.Z enrichment on unmethylated DNA, whereas DNA methylation destabilizes DNA wrapping in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we provide direct behavioral evidence for a functional trade-off between these competing demands. Using a task that concurrently measured response inhibition, statistical learning, and self-reported task focus, we show that MW is associated with impaired inhibitory control but enhanced learning of probabilistic sequences. Critically, we reveal that these effects are mechanistically linked: the magnitude of the learning enhancement during MW is quantitatively modulated by the efficacy of response inhibition. These findings demonstrate that transient lapses in top-down executive control directly facilitate the implicit extraction of environmental statistics, supporting neurocompetition models and framing MW as a cognitive state that may be evolutionarily preserved to promote the unsupervised acquisition of predictive models.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Comparison of HRS cells to normal cellular subsets revealed evidence of abortive plasma cell differentiation, with an unfolded protein response signature, shared with plasma cell neoplasms, but not other B-cell lymphoma types.

Experimental validation confirmed 62% success rate (8/13 designs) with protein yields of 1.19-73.72 mg/L in aqueous buffer, representing a significant improvement over traditional membrane protein production method.

In mice, social hierarchies are expressed through proactive and competitive behaviors. Yet it remains unclear how these behavioral domains interact to shape social position in naturalistic groups, and whether hierarchical position reflects a stable individual trait that persists across different social contexts, or emerges from current group composition. To address these questions, we developed the NoSeMaze, a semi-naturalistic, open-source, modular platform that enables automated long-term tracking of unperturbed mouse groups. Across more than 4,000 mouse-days, hierarchies derived from naturalistic tube competitions were non-despotic, transitive, and stable even when group compositions changed. Thus, social rank reflected an internalized trait that individuals carried across different social contexts. Proactive chasing also showed trait-like stability, but was concentrated among high-ranking individuals, reflecting reciprocal status negotiation and contestation within the social elite. The link between chasing and rank strengthened in groups with less well-defined hierarchies, where mice relied more on aggressive signaling to assert their position. Consistent with multidimensional mouse personalities, chasing and social rank were only punctually associated with simultaneously measured physical and cognitive traits. In summary, naturalistic high-dimensional tracking with the NoSeMaze reveals the multifaceted organization of social hierarchy in mice, with stable, personality-like traits as a major axis. The approach thus enables modeling individuality and social status as key resilience factors within naturalistic mouse groups.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that MreB does not stiffen the envelope directly, but instead mechanically couples the cell wall to the cytoplasmic membrane through its role in peptidoglycan synthesis, increasing resistance to bending. Under hyperosmotic stress, MreB relocalized to the poles, forming linkages that prevent membrane detachment from the cell wall and attenuate cytoplasmic contraction.

In Drosophila, the coiled-coil protein Cnn forms a scaffold that recruits PCM clients; in C.elegans, SPD-5 plays an analogous role. Here we show that full-length Cnn and SPD-5 can both form spherical condensates in vitro, but that the interactions driving their assembly into scaffolds inside cells appear to diverge. We show that the Cnn PReM adopts a helical hairpin fold that autoinhibits CM2 binding but that phosphorylation appears to increase hairpin breathing to permit CM2 engagement and robust scaffold assembly. Phospho-blocking mutations prevent PReM--CM2 interactions and scaffold formation, whereas phospho-mimetic substitutions partially restore function. The human homologue CDK5RAP2 contains a CM2 domain that can partially substitute for fly CM2 in vivo and we identify a candidate CDK5RAP2 PReM region that forms macromolecular networks with human CM2 in vitro. By contrast, the putative PReM and CM2 regions of SPD-5 cannot substitute for their equivalent fly domains and they do not interact detectably, suggesting a distinct assembly mechanism in worms despite conserved PLK1-dependent control of PCM growth.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

When delivered during the first, novel session, taVNS accelerated reaction times, reduced response variability, and attenuated the typical block-wise decline in subjective focus. Concurrently, fronto-central P1-N1 and parietal N1-P2 amplitudes were enhanced, and larger P1-N1 amplitudes predicted faster responses, linking early cortical gain to behavioral performance.

We begin with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to systematically explore how the symmetry of the nucleocapsid core, together with the relative strengths of spike-core and spike-spike interactions, influences budding efficiency and the emergence of icosahedral particle symmetry. Building on these computational predictions, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on Chikungunya virus 181/25 and examine the consequences for particle assembly and budding in cultured cells, as well as the impact of these mutations during in-cellulo assembly. Our results reveal that canonical core-spike interactions, while necessary, are not sufficient for successful assembly. Instead, lateral interactions among glycoproteins emerge as critical determinants of efficient budding, particle stability, and the maintenance of icosahedral symmetry. Together, these findings provide an integrated computational and experimental framework for understanding the molecular principles governing Alphavirus assembly.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

To investigate this hypothesis, we contrasted functional MRI (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) responses to compare neural responses to images that are equally well recognized by humans, but that differ in whether they could be solved by a feedforward deep neural network; a computational proxy for ventral stream feedforward processing.

Mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) represent a major genetic cause of familial ALS, driving motor neuron degeneration through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. Although gene silencing approaches targeting SOD1 show substantial therapeutic potential, their clinical translation remains restricted by suboptimal delivery to the spinal motor neurons and safety concerns linked to conventional viral vectors. This study presents a minimally invasive gene therapy strategy that combines the retrograde transport capability of rAAV2-retro with the safety of an artificial microRNA (miRNA) to achieve pan-spinal SOD1 silencing. A single intramuscular injection of rAAV2-retro-miRNA into neonatal SOD1G93A mice resulted in widespread transduction of spinal motor neurons, significant reduction of mutant SOD1 protein, and multifaceted therapeutic benefits. Treated mice exhibited delayed disease onset, extended lifespan, preserved motor function, reduced neuroinflammation, and protection of neuromuscular junctions and spinal motor neurons. Importantly, the artificial miRNA construct demonstrated a superior safety profile relative to short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based constructs, which induced marked toxicity and lethality in wild-type mice. These findings establish neonatal intramuscular delivery of rAAV2-retro-miRNA as a safe, efficient, and clinically translatable strategy for preemptive intervention in SOD1-mediated ALS, offering broader applicability to other motor neuron diseases.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of Diptera (true flies), integrating morphology, wingbeat kinematics, and aerodynamics within a phylogenetic framework. We quantified morphology in 133 species spanning the Dipteran phylogenetic and size range, and for a subset of 46 species, we combined high-speed stereoscopic videography with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to characterize wingbeat kinematics and aerodynamic performance, respectively. Our results reveal that morphology is strongly structured by phylogeny, whereas wingbeat kinematics are broadly conserved across Diptera, reflecting dominant aerodynamic constraints. Two basal lineages, Culicomorpha (mosquitoes and midges) and Tipulomorpha (crane flies), exhibit strikingly divergent kinematics and aerodynamics, suggesting lineage-specific selective pressures. Scaling analyses show that smaller species compensate for reduced aerodynamic force production efficacy through relatively larger wings, and higher wingbeat frequencies. Moreover, miniaturization is constrained by increased viscous drag at low Reynolds numbers, causing a plateau in aerodynamic power reduction with decreasing size. We further demonstrate that mosquitoes exhibit disproportionately high aerodynamic and acoustic power, coupled with enlarged flight musculature, consistent with sexual selection favoring acoustic signaling during in-swarm mating. This trade-off highlights how reproductive pressures can override aerodynamic efficiency. By integrating comparative morphology, kinematics, and aerodynamics across a major insect radiation, our study uncovers the interplay between physical scaling laws, aerodynamic constraints, and ecological pressures in shaping the evolution of animal flight.

Although IFN-{gamma} activates both STAT1 and STAT3, how these pathways interact to regulate immune evasion under hypoxia remains unclear. Methods: Using the MC38 murine colorectal cancer model and T cell-tumor spheroid co-culture assays, we examined how IFN-{gamma} signaling through STAT1 and STAT3 influences PD-L1 expression, CSC plasticity, and cytotoxic T cell function under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA knockdown were used to dissect pathway function, and Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelmintic, was evaluated as a dual STAT1/STAT3 inhibitor. Results: We found that IFN-{gamma} primarily induced PD-L1 through STAT1 activation, while CSC plasticity was associated with STAT3 signaling. STAT1 and STAT3 displayed reciprocal regulation-blocking one enhanced activation of the other. Niclosamide effectively inhibited phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, which led to suppressed PD-L1 upregulation and reduced CSC enrichment. In addition, it also partially inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1 expression. In co-culture assays, Niclosamide improved T cell infiltration and reduced exhaustion under hypoxic conditions, resulting in improved T cell killing. Conclusions: Our findings identified Niclosamide as a potent dual STAT1/3 inhibitor capable of reversing IFN-{gamma} and hypoxia-driven immune evasion.

We hypothesized that low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) with frequency parameters mimicking oscillatory patterns would enable targeted neuromodulation. Building on prior findings of the ability of LIFU to modulate neurotransmission, we investigated the effects of frequency-modulated LIFU applied to the prelimbic cortex (PLC) on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core as well as neuronal and astrocytic activity. After three 80-second LIFU stimulations spaced 30 minutes apart, we found that LIFU excited or inhibited NAcc dopamine release for up to 90 minutes, and these effects were dependent on oscillation frequency and sex. In male rats, theta (8 Hz)-coupled beta (16 Hz) LIFU reduced both dopamine release by 58% and the level of the astrocytic marker GFAP by 50%. Similar decreases in dopamine density were observed in females. Delta (2 Hz)-coupled beta (16 Hz) stimulation produced similar inhibitory effects. Conversely, theta (5 Hz)-coupled gamma (50 Hz) LIFU increased dopamine release by 28% in males. However, similar excitation levels were observed only in females with an increased gamma frequency of 70 Hz (coupled with a theta frequency of 7 Hz). Histological analysis revealed no cell death, but both 8:16 Hz and 5:50 Hz LIFU elevated neuronal activation (cFOS) in the PLC in males, while 5:50 Hz also upregulated GFAP by 30%, suggesting astrocytic involvement.

Much of AVPs effect on social behavior is mediated by the most widely-expressed AVP receptor in the central nervous system: the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR). Dense expression of V1aR is found in males and females in the lateral septum (LS), which also receives heavy input from sexually-differentiated populations of AVP cells in the extended amygdala. In order to access and interrogate the structure and function of V1aR cells, we developed and validated a V1aR-Cre knockin mouse line (Avpr1a-P2A-iCre). V1aR-Cre mice did not differ from their Cre-negative littermates in their health, sensorimotor function, anxiety/motivational behavioral responses, or in their V1aR binding levels in the LS. The distribution of Cre in the brain, as assessed by crosses with Cre-reporter mouse lines and in situ hybridization (ISH), was highly similar to patterns of V1aR binding and demonstrated strong colocalization between Cre and V1aR expression within LS cells. We used this V1aR-Cre mouse to identify the inputs and outputs of V1aR+ cells in the LS, via a monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus as well as anterograde synaptophysin-mRuby AAV tracing approaches. Monosynaptic inputs to V1aR LS cells were observed from the medial preoptic area (MPA), lateral hypothalamus (LH), hippocampus (mostly ventral), medial septum, diagonal band of Broca (DBB), and the supramammillary nucleus (SuM). Synaptophysin labeling revealed outputs to some of these same structures (MS, LH, DBB, SuM) as well as parts of the lateral preoptic area (LPO), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), and ventral pallidum. Notably, most structures (except for hippocampus) bidirectionally connected to V1aR LS cells also contain populations of V1aR+ cells and are targets for BNST/MeA AVP cells, suggesting an integrated AVP/V1aR circuit. Finally, using ISH, we measured levels of V1aR mRNA expression in subregions of the LS and colocalization of V1aR with oxytocin receptor (OTR) mRNA, which also has a high affinity for AVP, within the LS. We found similar high percentages of cells containing V1aR+ puncta across dorsal and intermediate LS in both males and females. In contrast, the ventral LS contained fewer V1aR+ cells in both males and females. The highest level of co-expression of V1aR and OTR was found in the intermediate LS in both sexes, suggesting the possible location of functional interactions between AVP and oxytocin within the LS. We also sought to identify other phenotypic aspects of V1aR cells using ISH and confirmed that all LS V1aR cells are GABAergic and that most also express corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, suggesting a substrate by which AVP could interact with stress-related systems in the LS. Our characterized V1aR-Cre mouse will be a valuable resource for understanding the role of AVP/V1aR in behavioral and physiological systems. Using this mouse, we have characterized the connectional architecture of V1aR cells in the LS and revealed an interlocking set of structures that may be the substrate through which AVP regulates social and emotional behavior.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

In mammals, three main neuronal pathways through the BG have been described - the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways - which together orchestrate many aspects of learning and behavior. In songbirds, cell types associated with striatal and pallidal components appear intermingled in a single basal ganglia nucleus, Area X, essential for song learning. This allows for the dense reconstruction of the entire circuit within a compact volume. Here, we introduce the first vertebrate basal ganglia connectome, comprising over 8,500 automated neuron reconstructions connected by about 20 million synapses. High image quality and automated reconstruction allowed analysis with minimal manual proofreading. Based on direct anatomical measurement of synaptic connectivity, we confirm that a direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathway can be traced through Area X. However, detailed morphological and connectomic analysis revealed no clearly distinct direct and indirect medium spiny neuron subpopulations, and a dominance of the direct and hyperdirect pathway. In addition to previously identified neuron types in Area X, we could distinguish three novel GABAergic neuron types, two of which are major output targets of GPe neurons, leading to novel feedback circuitry within Area X. We further found unexpectedly strong neuronal interconnectivity and recurrency between neurons associated with all pathways.

Lhx2 and Lhx9 activate Robo3 while also inducing its repressor, Barhl2. Additionally, negative feedback loops fine-tune the transience of Robo3 expression by adjusting the relative strength of the activation and repression modules.

To establish causality, C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive either a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) or regular diet (RD) for three days prior to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Measurements and Main Results: Survivors had significantly higher cholesterol levels than non-survivors (median, 135 vs. 126 mg/dL, p < 0.001). High cholesterol ([&ge;] 133 mg/dL) was independently associated with reduced 28-day mortality (adjusted HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.95, p = 0.012). In mice, HCD elevated plasma cholesterol and significantly improved survival (52.5% to 90%), independent of immune modulation. Hepatic transcriptomics revealed metabolic reprogramming, including upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and glutathione-mediated antioxidant pathways, and suppression of endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis. Notably, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration abolished the survival benefit. Conclusions: Elevated plasma cholesterol causally improves sepsis outcomes by promoting hepatic metabolic reprogramming. These findings offer mechanistic insight into clinical observations and suggest hepatic bioenergetics as a novel therapeutic target in sepsis.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Traditional emotion research has often assumed that facial expressions reliably reflect internal emotional states and conform to a set of universal expressions. However, emerging evidence suggests that facial expressions are highly individualized and influenced by context. To investigate these factors, we used genetic algorithms to enable participants to generate personalized facial expressions that best matched their subjective interpretation of affect within written contextual scenarios. 12 participants read standardized scenarios drawn from Howard Schatz's Actors Acting, which had been independently rated (0-4) across 13 primary emotions (Amusement, Anger, Awe, Contempt, Disgust, Embarrassment, Fear, Happiness, Interest, Pride, Sadness, Shame, Surprise). Each primary emotion was paired with all 12 secondary emotions that were either maximized (Condition 1) or minimized (Condition 2). Participants completed 26 such randomly interleaved trials, followed by the last condition (Condition 3) in which they selected faces corresponding directly to each of the 13 emotion words. Faces were generated within the 199-dimensional coefficient space of the Basel Face Database, with a genetic algorithm presenting 12 unique faces across 6 generations per scenario. Faces selected by participants as matching a given scenario were semi-randomly combined to generate 6 offspring per generation, with the remaining 6 faces created randomly to maintain genetic diversity. A 4-way ANOVA (factors: affect, context, generation, participant) on the cosine distances among faces revealed a significant main effect of affect (p = .0061) and a significant interaction between affect and context (p = .0003). These results indicate that distinct facial structures are associated with different emotions, but the representation of a given emotion is context-dependent.

Here, we use electron microscopy-based connectomics to examine how migrating neurons interact with mature circuit elements in the adult zebra finch striatum. Immature neurons exhibiting migratory features were observed contacting diverse structures in their microenvironment, including the axons, dendrites, synapses, and somas of mature neurons. Surprisingly, these interactions were structurally complex, often involving pronounced deformations of mature somas and the surrounding neuropil. These deformations appeared as 'tunnels' made by the migratory neurons as they displaced mature structures along their path. Together, these findings suggest that migrating neurons may physically reshape the mature circuit to reach their targets, revealing an unexpected degree of structural and functional plasticity in the adult brain.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

To resolve this, we developed a closed-loop protocol that analyzes neuronal spiking in real time and adaptively presents new stimuli based on semantic similarity to response-eliciting previous ones. We found that human concept cells show graded responses, following semantic tuning curves. Furthermore, the tuning width and steepness of MTL neurons vary, with the hippocampus exhibiting the steepest tuning. Regional analysis of these tuning curves yields region-specific categorical response profiles (e.g., food responses in the amygdala).

Serum PFAS concentrations have been linked to increased type 2 diabetes risk, but whether this is caused by direct effects of PFAS on the endocrine pancreas remains unclear. This study expands on previous biodistribution data to better characterize PFAS accumulation in human pancreas. We also assessed the effects of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) on pancreatic beta cell function using various model systems. Methods We measured concentrations of three legacy PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS) in plasma and pancreas from 88 human donors. We also modeled PFOS and PFOA exposure in mice to confirm our human biodistribution data. We next exposed immortalized INS-1 cells, primary human donor islets, and primary mouse islets to DMSO (vehicle) or PFOS (1, 10 or 100 M) either acutely during a glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assay or for 48h (prolonged) and GSIS was subsequently measured. We also assessed whether the acute effects of PFOS on GSIS in mouse islets were mediated by G-protein coupled receptor-40 (GPR40) and/or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Lastly, we exposed female mice to DMSO or 10 mg/kg PFOS with or without a 2 g/kg glucose bolus to assess the acute effects of PFOS on glucose homeostasis in vivo. Results PFOS was detected at higher concentrations in both plasma and pancreas compared to PFOA and PFHxS in our human donor population. Similarly, PFOS accumulated in pancreas at concentrations 2x higher than PFOA in our mouse model. We provide compelling evidence that PFOS exposure dysregulates insulin secretion in various model systems. Prolonged PFOS exposure suppressed GSIS in INS-1 832/3 cells and mouse islets, whereas acute PFOS exposure stimulated GSIS in mouse islets and in a subset of our human donor islets. We also show that the acute effects of PFOS on GSIS in mouse islets were partly mediated by GLP-1R. Importantly, acute PFOS exposure increased plasma insulin levels in female mice in vivo, but only when PFOS exposure was concurrent with a glucose bolus. Conclusions Legacy PFAS chemicals are consistently detected in human pancreas tissue. We clearly show that PFOS exposure dysregulates insulin secretion in various model systems, although effects varied based on the model and duration of exposure. Collectively, our findings support emerging evidence that PFOS contribute to beta cell dysfunction and points to the importance of model selection when assessing toxicological effects of PFAS on islet function.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

To meet this need, we de-veloped a sensing platform that integrates functionalized gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow immunoassay (AuNPs-LFIA) with a machine vision model, enabling rapid quantitative detection of cTnI and Myo.

However, surgically clearing the axilla carries morbidity, so less invasive methods of risk-stratifying patients are needed. ALN fine needle aspiration (FNA) is currently used to detect BC metastases, but these samples also contain immune cells. Here we show that FNA acquires sufficient leukocytes for comprehensive immunophenotyping of reactive, patient-derived ALN. All CD4+ and CD8+ T cells subsets (naive, terminal effector, central and effector memory) and rarer (<2%) natural killer (NK) and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDCs) populations are represented. Importantly, the immune cell profile of one reactive ALN appears to reflect the immune status of the patient's axilla.

Significantly increased numbers of naive CD4+ T cells, but significantly fewer terminal effector, central memory and effector memory subpopulations, were obtained from patients with [&ge;] metastatic ALN. Moreover, despite their sparse distribution pattern on whole-section immunohistochemistry (WSI), FNA revealed that CD56+ NK cell activation receptors were decreased in patients with [&ge;] metastatic ALN.

CVL impacts many aspects of everyday living including subjective reports of deficits in facial expression perception. We quantify the perception of facial affect with a paradigm in which participants created individualized representations of facial expressions using a generative face model and genetic algorithms. 8 patients with CVL ([&ge;]1.3logMAR in better eye) and 8 normally-sighted young controls selected computer-generated faces that manifest each of 13 primary affects (Amusement, Anger, Awe, Contempt, Disgust, Embarrassment, Fear, Happiness, Interest, Pride, Sadness, Shame, and Surprise). An additional group of 8 age-matched normally-sighted controls matched the first four affects. For each affect, 6 generations of 12 faces were generated from the Basel Face database, in which 199 parameters modulate the structure of each face. After the 1st generation, 6 faces were created by combinations of the parameters of faces selected in the previous generation. The remaining r 6 faces were random to introduce genetic variability. A pilot study showed that subjects were most sensitive to changes in the first 20 face parameters, so the analysis was restricted to these. A 2-way ANOVA for the 20 mean coefficients values were compared between the patients and controls. There was a significant (P<.05) main effect for Amusement, Anger, Awe, Disgust, Fear, Interest, and Surprise and a significant (P<.05) interaction for all affects. Overall, coefficient values were closer to 0 for the CVL group, indicating that less extreme face expressions were selected. However, there was no significant difference between groups in the total number of faces selected for each affect besides Fear. This suggests that the tendency towards more neutral faces in CVL patients was not simply a consequence of low sensitivity to affect expression, additionally demonstrating that neither group has a positivity or negativity bias for affective stimuli. These data suggest that CVL patients have significantly different perceptions of facial expressions than age-matched controls. CVL patients have a tendency to choose more neutral looking faces to represent a given affect, whereas the control group chose more extreme, caricatured faces. Elucidating individual differences in emotion representation and recognition has implications for populations including neurotypical, visually impaired, and neurodivergent people.

We demonstrate that loss of Trib2 protects mice from diet-induced obesity, alleviates hepatic steatosis, and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Trib2 knockout mice exhibit elevated UCP1 expression in brown adipose tissue, leading to enhanced thermogenesis and increased heat production. Mechanistically, TRIB2 acts as a scaffold that binds UCP1 through its pseudokinase domain and recruits the E3 ligase MYCBP2, thereby promoting UCP1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized post-translational mechanism that regulates UCP1 stability and link TRIB2 function to both thermogenic adaptation and metabolic health, thereby highlighting TRIB2 as a potential therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic disorders.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

We recorded SSVEPs from flies that expressed constitutively active or inactive (kinase-dead) variants of GSK3{beta} and showed that the visual responses of these flies differed from those of controls.

In a retrospective analysis of 241 drugs, we show that the ratio of their in vivo maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) to their lowest in vitro toxicity strongly correlates with clinical DILI risks, with ROC AUC up to 96%. Then, we show that comparable predictivity (ROC AUC up to 91%) is achievable prospectively when Cmax values are predicted in silico by high-throughput physiologically based kinetic modelling. Dynamic simulations of bile acid perturbations further identify drugs potentially causing DILI specifically through BSEP inhibition, providing additional mechanistic insights. This integrative, mechanistic approach shows enhanced DILI predictivity and interpretability, offering an animal-free alternative for early drug development.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

This mega-analysis investigates neural activation during response inhibition and error processing using adult and pediatric data from the ENIGMA-OCD consortium and the ABCD study. Methods Individual participant data was uniformly processed using HALFpipe to extract statistical maps for response inhibition and error processing contrasts. Bayesian multilevel models were used to assess regional and whole-brain effects of OCD, with additional analyses examining the association between the OCD clinical profile and task-related activation. Results Across inhibitory control tasks, both individuals with OCD and control participants showed robust activation in regions implicated in response inhibition and error processing. During response inhibition, compared to controls, adults with OCD showed stronger somatomotor cortex activation, while children with OCD showed stronger occipital cortex activation. Children with likely OCD from the ABCD cohort showed reduced activity in the frontoparietal network in the anterior insula/frontal operculum region. During error processing, relative to controls, adults with OCD showed weaker activation in fronto-striatal regions, while children with OCD showed stronger activation in frontoparietal and attention networks. Greater OCD symptom severity was associated with weaker task-related activation in adults and stronger activation in children during response inhibition. Conclusion Case-control differences in brain activation during inhibitory control varied by age group and task contrast. Symptom severity emerged as the main clinical correlate of activation during inhibition, suggesting that inhibitory control deficits in OCD may be both state-dependent and developmentally specific.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Currently, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids (PDOs) are valuable biological models for functional precision oncology; however, variable success rates of establishment and prolonged timelines limit their clinical application for real-time drug testing. To overcome this, we developed a Tumor-on-Chip (ToC) platform that enables functional drug sensitivity profiling within a clinically actionable 4-day timeframe. We compared ToC models with PDX results, and demonstrated high reproducibility and strong concordance with in vivo PDX responses. Drug sensitivity was correctly identified ex vivo in 88% of PDX-responsive cases, while resistance was detected in 91%, with no false positives at clinically relevant drug concentrations. To facilitate clinical translation, we engineered a custom microfluidic chip optimized for minimal breast cancer biopsy material, yielding results similar to those obtained from resection samples. We ultimately demonstrated the proof-of-concept for applying this platform to patient samples as a further tool for guiding clinical decision-making and discriminated between resistance and sensitive profiles among patients. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and translational potential of ToC models for personalized drug profiling in breast cancer, laying the groundwork for their integration into real-time clinical decision-making workflows.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense power in decoding complex sequential data, their application to the \"language of immunity\" remains nascent. Existing computational models often struggle to capture the hierarchical, multi-scale nature of immune responses and fail to model biologically plausible system perturbations. To bridge this gap, we propose the Immuno-Linguistic Spatiotemporal Transformer (ILST), a self-supervised framework inspired by LLM architectures. Our framework introduces two key innovations: a Biologically-Informed Perturbation (BIP) module that simulates systemic events (e.g., infection or therapy) by respecting the functional importance of key T-cell clones, and a Hierarchical Tissue-Scale Fusion (HTF) module that uses attention to dynamically weigh and combine representations from cellular, tissue, and systemic levels. We validate our model on several public graph datasets, which serve as effective proxies for complex biological networks with varying degrees of heterogeneity. ILST achieves consistently strong results in predicting node states. Notably, it significantly enhances performance on heterogeneous (disassortative) graphs, demonstrating its potential for robustly modeling T-cell dynamics in complex microenvironments like tumors.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Within these networks, canonical motifs such as genetic toggle switches and repressilators serve as building blocks that generate bistable and oscillatory behaviors. An open question is how cells regulate the dynamical behavior of such motifs, both in natural contexts and in synthetic systems. Recent studies highlight phase separation of transcription factors (TFs) and nucleic acids as a key organizing principle of intracellular biochemistry. In this work, we explore how phase separation of TFs influences the dynamics of toggle switch and repressilator using mean-field theory and stochastic simulations. Our mean-field analysis reveals that phase separation reshapes motif dynamics by altering fixed-point stability and basin geometry in toggle switch, and by altering oscillatory cycles in repressilator. A key finding for both motifs is that when multiple TFs undergo phase separation, the one with the lowest saturation concentration for phase separation dominates system dynamics. Interestingly, stochastic simulations show that the impact of phase separation on fluctuations (or noise) in the abundance of transcription factors within network motifs is architecture-dependent and sharply contrasts with its buffering effect on noise in the expression of isolated genes. Overall, our results show that biomolecular phase separation acts as a physical principle for tuning stability and noise in gene regulatory networks, providing new insights into cellular decision-making.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors, including HNSCC, and can reduce radiotherapy efficacy by modulating DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, and inflammatory signaling. However, the combined impact of hypoxia and HPV status on cellular radiosensitivity remains poorly defined. We investigated the influence of hypoxia (1% O2) and gamma-irradiation on proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, transcriptomic profiles, and cytokine/chemokine secretion in three HNSCC cell lines: HPV-negative FaDu and Detroit-562 (metastatic origin), and HPV-positive 2A3. Cells were cultured under chronic hypoxic or ambient conditions, with or without irradiation. Independent of HPV status or metastatic phenotype, hypoxia prolonged the cell doubling time, while only irradiated cells (under both oxygen conditions) exhibited features of an intermediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. Treatment of HPV-positive cells significantly decreased the number of upregulated genes, reduced cytokine secretion (IL-8, SERPINE1), and affected all phases of the cell cycle compared with HPV-negative cells. Furthermore, only the metastatic cell line showed no change in cleaved caspase-3 levels after irradiation in hypoxia and produced higher levels of cytokines (IL-8, SERPINE1). Our findings highlight how tumor oxygenation and HPV status intersect to modulate the radiation response in HNSCC.

Previous experimental studies have observed that cancer cells exposed to chronic hypoxia retained a phenotype characterized by enhanced migration and reduced proliferation, even after being shifted to normoxic conditions, a phenomenon which we refer to as hypoxic memory. However, because dynamic hypoxia and related hypoxic memory effects are challenging to measure experimentally, our understanding of their implications in tumor invasion is quite limited. Here, we propose a novel phenotype-structured partial differential equation modeling framework to elucidate the effects of hypoxic memory on tumor invasion along one spatial dimension in a cyclically varying hypoxic environment. We incorporated hypoxic memory by including time-dependent changes in hypoxic-to-normoxic phenotype transition rate upon continued exposure to hypoxic conditions. Our model simulations demonstrate that hypoxic memory significantly enhances tumor invasion without necessarily reducing tumor volume. This enhanced invasion was sensitive to the induction rate of hypoxic memory, but not the dilution rate. Further, shorter periods of cyclic hypoxia contributed to a more heterogeneous profile of hypoxic memory in the population, with the tumor front dominated by hypoxic cells that exhibited stronger memory. Overall, our model highlighted the complex interplay between hypoxic memory and cyclic hypoxia in shaping heterogeneous tumor invasion patterns.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

This work reveals that in the skin of three species of Atherinidae, an extremely rapid flashing iridophore acts as fluid pressure sensor and visualizes micro-circulations in the layer. The fish has a capillary network propagating fluid pressure from the primal circulation systems. Complex of xanthophore, iridophore and micro-circulation network forms the twinkling spot that change light reflection intensity in 100 ms. The movement of light reflecting particles of iridophore, to which fluid pressure is applied, is the mechanism of twinkling skin tissue. The iridophores form a membrane with honeycomb compartments containing guanine platelets. Micro-circulation capillaries are embedded in the honeycomb membrane and provide driven forces for the light reflecting platelet movements. Two dimensional image of the micro-citculation appears on the twinkling patterns. The results suggest that real-time visualization of the micro-circulations can be achieved in the body of the Atherinidae.

Here, we reconstruct the most comprehensive dated phylogeny of Lagomorphs to date, encompassing 84 of 102 extant species, including newly sequenced genomes of Ochotona nubrica and O. ladacensis. Using ancestral state reconstruction and phylogenetically informed comparative analyses, we examine how burrowing behavior relates to morphology, climate, habitat, sociality, and fecundity. Our results reveal that burrowing evolved multiple times independently within Lagomorphs, with the ancestral state of Ochotonids inferred as burrowing and that of Leporids as semi-fossorial or form-dwelling. Contrary to expectations, burrowing species did not show distinct hind-limb adaptations or associations with extreme or variable climates.

We introduce PRSformer, a scalable deep learning architecture designed for end-to-end, multitask disease prediction directly from million-scale individual genotypes. PRSformer employs neighborhood attention, achieving linear O(L) complexity per layer, making Transformers tractable for genome-scale inputs. Crucially, PRSformer utilizes a stacking of these efficient attention layers, progressively increasing the effective receptive field to model local dependencies (e.g., within linkage disequilibrium blocks) before integrating information across wider genomic regions. This design, tailored for genomics, allows PRSformer to learn complex, potentially non-linear and long-range interactions directly from raw genotypes. We demonstrate PRSformer's effectiveness using a unique large private cohort (N{approx}5M) for predicting 18 autoimmune and inflammatory conditions using L{approx}140k variants. PRSformer significantly outperforms highly optimized linear models trained on the same individual-level data and state-of-the-art summary-statistic-based methods (LDPred2) derived from the same cohort, quantifying the benefits of non-linear modeling and multitask learning at scale.

Despite improvements in surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments, the prognosis for advanced ovarian cancer remains poor, highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has emerged as a promising treatment, delivering heated chemotherapeutic agents directly into the peritoneal cavity post-cytoreductive surgery. However, HIPEC adoption is limited by three critical complications: suboptimal therapeutic efficacy in resistant tumors; abdominal adhesion formation; and systemic toxicity, including cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. This study investigates carbon monoxide gas-entrapping materials (CO-GEMs) as a novel multifunctional adjunctive therapy to address the three HIPEC limitations simultaneously. CO-GEMs effectively encapsulate and deliver carbon monoxide, leveraging the differential effects of CO in cancerous where it has been shown to reduce tumor burden. In ovarian cancer models, CO-GEMs significantly enhanced cisplatin efficacy, reducing the metastatic tumor burden by 46.6% through the downregulation of drug resistance pathways, including the IL-17, TNF, and NF-{kappa}B pathways; ECM receptor interaction, and VEGF signaling. CO-GEMs also prevented peritoneal adhesion formation by suppressing inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition, with a significant reduction in adhesion severity scores. Additionally, enteral CO-GEMs provided significant nephroprotection against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, as demonstrated by reduced blood urea nitrogen levels. CO-GEMs represent a promising innovation that simultaneously improves HIPEC therapeutic efficacy, prevents surgical complications, and reduces systemic toxicity.

We find that BLOSUM similarity scores between designed and parental antibody sequences correlate strongly with measured binding affinity - on par with the predictive performance of a state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model. Moreover, these BLOSUM scores also align closely with log-likelihoods from multiple generative models, suggesting that such models may be implicitly learning evolutionary priors encoded in substitution matrices. In contrast, similarity scores based on position weight matrices (PWMs) and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) that do not require the knowledge of the parental sequence show weaker and less consistent alignment with binding affinity, with performance depending on the source of the background sequence data.

We find that BLOSUM similarity scores between designed and parental antibody sequences correlate strongly with measured binding affinity - on par with the predictive performance of a state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model. Moreover, these BLOSUM scores also align closely with log-likelihoods from multiple generative models, suggesting that such models may be implicitly learning evolutionary priors encoded in substitution matrices. In contrast, similarity scores based on position weight matrices (PWMs) and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) that do not require the knowledge of the parental sequence show weaker and less consistent alignment with binding affinity, with performance depending on the source of the background sequence data.

While deep learning has excelled, the optimal representation of sequence data remains an open question. This study explores protein sonification---the conversion of amino acid sequences into 2D spectrograms---as a representation for this task. To facilitate this investigation, we developed a benchmark dataset of 18,000 sequences spanning 12 functionally diverse protein classes. Our systematic evaluation suggests that the structural transformation from a 1D sequence to a 2D spectrogram may be a key contributor to the model's predictive performance. This observation is supported by ablation studies where models using either purely visual or acoustic features from the spectrogram demonstrated effective standalone performance, suggesting that the representation itself is a key source of this capability. For instance, a model using a sonification map without explicit biophysical meaning achieved 81.08% accuracy, while our biophysically-informed model reached 84.00%, indicating that such domain knowledge may offer a modest performance benefit. When trained from scratch on our dataset, our fusion model achieved performance comparable to or slightly exceeding that of standard transformer architectures like ESM-2 and ProtBERT, suggesting its potential for data efficiency in this specific context. The model's potential for generalizability was further supported by its performance on the external CARE enzyme classification benchmark, where it achieved 90.44% accuracy. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we explore the utility of our encoding to guide a diffusion model in generating novel GFP variants, which were assessed for structural viability using computational methods. Our work provides evidence suggesting that the utility of sonification in this context may stem largely from its representational structure, offering a perspective on feature engineering for biological sequences.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Understanding the features of DFLs is limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets and accurate predictive models. In this study, we propose a classification for DFLs that includes linkers joining two domains (DLD), a domain and a motif (MLD/DLM) or two short linear motifs (MLM). We developed a workflow that allows the systematic identification of DLD-type linkers from protein structures and created a comprehensive dataset known as the DLD dataset. The DLD dataset includes 1640 independent domain linkers (IDLs) which significantly expands all currently available linker datasets and additionally annotates related regions such as dependent-domain linkers, intra-domain loops, and termini. Our data collection process integrates missing residue completion and smoothing of short secondary structure stretches enabling to capture a higher number of longer IDLs. We assessed the features of IDLs using t-SNE analysis and protein language model embedding with a CNN-based classifier. IDLs can be distinguished from other disordered and folded protein regions, and their features highly overlap with DisProt Linkers, considered the gold standard for linker annotation. The DLD dataset offers a valuable resource for researchers seeking to investigate the features of disordered flexible linkers and to improve the accuracy and generalizability of DFL predictive models.

Although DNA storage techniques have been performed on a significant scale, challenges arise from the synthesis and sequencing of data-encoded oligonucleotides. Synthesis of DNA introduces significant noise into the process. Consequently, high-read-quality sequencers are often required, making the process expensive and lack scalability. Recent DNA storage methods use error correction codes to encode data with resilience to noise, at a cost of additional redundancy and decoding complexity. Given such constraints and challenges, the main objective we seek to deliver is a time- and storage-efficient image coding strategy. We introduce a novel DNA-based progressive JPEG decoder with on-the-fly error-correcting \\& rendering capability. This system can progressively decode an image while also correcting for errors as they occur. It modifies standard JPEG encoding methods to store data in localized chunks and uses adapted Raptor error-correction codes to improve the speed and quality of partial decoding. We optimized and evaluated the method under varying levels of simulated Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing errors, as well as show how different parts of the pipeline improve real-time decoding capability.

Gain-of-functional mutations in this channel lead to neonatal diabetes mellitus, a rare disorder in which certain mutants demonstrate resistance to standard sulfonylurea therapy. Recent studies have identified a centipede toxin, SpTx1, as a potent inhibitor of both human pancreatic KATP channels and their gain-of-functional mutants. This toxin stimulates insulin secretion, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for neonatal diabetes. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which SpTx1 inhibits the KATP channel has remained elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of SpTx1 and the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the KATP channel in complex with SpTx1. Our results demonstrate that SpTx1 binds to the extracellular surface of the Kir6.2 pore-forming subunit of the KATP channel. Multiple interactions at the SpTx1-Kir6.2 interface underpin the high affinity and specificity of SpTx1 for human Kir6.2. We show that SpTx1 inhibits potassium currents by physically blocking the ion conduction pore. Furthermore, a structure-guided search identified another centipede toxin, Sm3a, as a novel KATP channel blocker. Together, these findings provide key insights into the inhibitory mechanism of centipede toxins against the human Kir6.2-containing KATP channel and establish a foundation for developing these toxins into potential therapeutics targeting KATP channel-related diseases.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Our results show that Akt1Y350F mice, resistant to Akt1 nitration, are protected against PAH in a SU5416/hypoxia (SU5416/Hx) model, exhibiting lower right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), reduced right ventricular hypertrophy, and decreased vascular occlusion.

J.", "abstract": "Parameter inference for stochastic models is essential for quantitative biology, but is hampered by intractable likelihoods. Agent-based random walk models, used widely in ecology and cell biology, exemplify this challenge, often forcing researchers to use likelihood-free methods like Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) that introduce biases and tuning difficulties, or else surrogate models which rely on a potentially unfaithful approximation and require an explicit, potentially erroneous, noise model. Here, we overcome these limitations using Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), a simulation-based, machine learning inference framework that learns the full posterior distribution. Once trained, NPE provides amortized, near-instantaneous posterior estimates. We deploy this framework on a random walk model of a barrier assay experiment describing in vitro cell migration. We demonstrate our approach in two settings: first, using one-dimensional summary statistics (column counts), and second, by augmenting NPE with a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) that enables NPE to learn directly from raw two-dimensional spatial data. In both cases, NPE remains the core inference engine, with the CNN serving as a feature extraction component for spatial data. On synthetic data, our NPE pipeline proves highly effective in both settings, delivering posterior estimates at a substantially reduced computational cost per inference. When applied to 1D summary statistics, the pipeline matches or exceeds the precision of classical methods. Similarly, for 2D spatial data, NPE augmented with CNN performs inference directly on raw images with a precision comparable to that from curated summary statistics. This second capability is critical, as it moves beyond the traditional reliance on lower-dimensional data and opens up new avenues for complex models where informative summary statistics are not obvious or available. We provide an open-source implementation of our pipeline to facilitate its adoption and extension to more complex, spatially-structured biological models.

A particularly striking example of these geometries is the recently discovered 'diamond-type' stereom, characterized by a diamond triply periodic minimal surface (D-TPMS) geometry and distinguished by its exceptional mechanical and structural properties. Despite its promising features for engineering applications, the morphogenesis of this microarchitecture remains poorly understood, notably due to its uniqueness in the natural world. Here, we applied a multimodal imaging and labeling approach to investigate the developmental processes underlying the formation of the diamond-type stereom in adults of a starfish species Protoreaster nodosus. We showed that this stereom type develops through two principal marginal growth patterns: trabecular trifurcation, which generates successive, horizontally spreading layers and occurs on flat external plate surfaces oriented approximately along the crystallographic {111} planes of the D-TPMS; and trabecular bifurcation, typically occurring along the edges of external plates and in the regions between trifurcating zones, aligned with the crystallographic {100} planes of the D-TPMS lattice. Although these growth patterns may proceed at different rates, they are tightly coordinated, resulting in the coherent D-TPMS microarchitecture. Furthermore, we demonstrated that F-actin cytoskeletal activity is consistently associated with active biomineralization fronts (trabecular tips), regardless of whether the stereom is of the diamond-type or of a less ordered, galleried form. Notably, we also observed that the formation of lateral bridges between adjacent stereom trabeculae is often preceded by the appearance of catenoid-like F-actin structures, suggesting a guiding and templating role for the cytoskeleton in building trabecular connectivity and shaping its peculiar curvature profile. Given the structural conservation of saddle-like features across multiple stereom types, we hypothesize that such minimal surface geometries may emerge as a result of tension-driven cytoskeletal dynamics acting as a physical template during biomineralization. Our observations underscore the critical involvement of the cytoskeleton in adult echinoderm biomineralization, implying that cytoskeletal patterning may actively contribute to complex adult skeletal microarchitecture.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

We now find that A20 is a powerful regulator of both glycolytic and mitochondrial respiration in macrophages. Differentiated macrophages that are acutely rendered A20 deficient exhibit increased glycolytic activity and markedly decreased mitochondrial respiration after LPS stimulation. These cells are unable to repolarize from an M1-like to M2-like phenotype. Compromised mitochondrial oxygen consumption in A20 deficient macrophages is caused by increased nitric oxide production.  Inhibition or genetic ablation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) restores mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and lactate production in these cells.

EGD-HP17, and Morganella sp. HMSC11D09) were strongly correlated with IgA responses against Salmonella and Shigella. In contrast, IgA reactive to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) was associated with other genera, including Staphylococcus. Notably, Lactobacillus species (L. bombi, L. kefiri, L. equi, and L. rhamnosus) were consistently linked to elevated IgA responses against Salmonella, Shigella, and EHEC. Moreover, levels of anti-Salmonella and anti-Shigella IgA were positively correlated with the use of infant formula containing prebiotic fibers or human milk oligosaccharides (5-HMO). Collectively, these findings highlight novel commensal taxa with potential as probiotic candidates to guide the development of next-generation infant formulas aimed at enhancing mucosal immunity and supporting infant health.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

During replication stress, transient bursts of nuclear actin assembly in S-phase promote fork remodelling and repair3,4, but how these bursts are initiated, regulated, and whether nuclear F-actin also act on DNA lesions inherited across cell cycles, remains unknown. Here, we show that replication stress induces nuclear actin assembly at liquid-liquid phase-separated (LLPS) promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs), driven by the actin-binding protein Anillin. Although best known as a cytokinesis factor, Anillin localises to PML NBs in interphase, where it concentrates monomeric actin (G-actin) and establishes a favourable environment for spontaneous actin assembly. Filament growth within these condensates remodels PML NB morphology and composition, releasing sequestered AKT into the nucleoplasm. AKT is subsequently phosphorylated and activated, and this nuclear AKT activity is required to regulate 53BP1 nuclear bodies in G1. These protective LLPS compartments shield under-replicated DNA inherited from the stressed S-phase until the following S-phase. This prevents premature engagement by aberrant repair pathways that would otherwise generate toxic intermediates and culminate in mitotic failure. Together, these findings define a condensate-to-filament pathway in which nuclear F-actin dynamically reorganises phase-separated compartments to safeguard genome stability across cell cycles.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Our method overcomes limitations of phase-contrast segmentation, yielding reliable single-cell dimensions.

L.; Ghedini, G.", "abstract": "Metabolism is density-dependent from unicellular to multicellular organisms. Understanding what drives metabolic suppression is important to explain population growth given the link between metabolism and biomass production. In the simplest scenario, metabolic suppression is caused by a reduction in resource availability with increasing population density. But both theory and experiments suggest that organisms can actively downregulate metabolism in crowded conditions. We experimentally disentangle the importance of resource competition and conspecific cues that signal crowding on the metabolism of three phytoplankton species of varying cell sizes at different growth phases. All species downregulated some aspects of their metabolism in response to cues; this response varied in strength but could not be explained by differences in species size. The addition of nutrients weakened and, in some cases, completely removed metabolic suppression, indicating that resource availability mediates responses to cues. Overall, respiration rates were more responsive to cues than photosynthesis, showing a differential regulation of processes of energy intake and expenditure depending on both resource availability and conspecific cues. These factors also led to rapid plastic changes in cell size possibly related to cell division and growth. Altogether, changes in size and metabolism indicate that cues can trigger self-regulatory adjustments that might limit growth, but these effects are modulated by nutrient availability and species traits not related to size. These results suggests that growth predictions solely based on resource availability might overestimate the rates at which organisms and populations grow, with important implications for how we describe species and community dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

M.; McCann, K.", "abstract": "Despite the rapid pace of global change altering temporal environmental patterning, we lack a general understanding of how periodic environments structure ecological communities. In fluctuating environments, nonlinear dynamics associated with temporal trade-offs between competing species can create the potential for both niche differentiation (coexistence) and seemingly unexpected outcomes (exclusion) that deviate from deterministic coexistence theory. Yet, the mechanisms behind these outcomes are not fully understood. Here, we show that periodic fluctuations between times of high and low growth (e.g., seasons), and adaptive temporal trade-offs within and between species, can drive counterintuitive over- and under-performance of competing species. Most notable is the counterintuitive outcome of seasonally-mediated competitive exclusion that would not occur in either season alone, but is rather the direct result of environmental variability itself. We find that seasonal trade-offs in species' growth rates, seasonal differences in competition strength, and functional similarity between competing species have the potential to drive nonlinear responses in coexistence to changing seasonality under global change. These biological conditions collectively influence our model's transient dynamics, further explaining the mechanisms behind counterintuitive outcomes and highlighting the importance of non-equilibrium theory for global change ecology. Importantly, the seasonal patterns and species' trade-offs that magnify these results are biologically realistic, therefore providing important insight into the implications for the maintenance of biodiversity under global change.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

In this model, the fast variables are total prevalence of susceptibles, single-infected and co-infected hosts in each patch (S,I,D). The slow variables are strain frequencies (z) in each patch. These local strain frequencies in each patch are governed by a replicator-like equation, where an additional contribution arises from migration, scaled explicitly by emergent patch heterogeneity. In our model, the strains can vary epidemiologically within- and between-patches along several traits, including transmission rates, clearance rates, priority effects and pairwise susceptibilities to coinfection; a complexity that totally defies straightforward prediction of their ecological outcome. However, harnessing the analytical advantage of this model reduction, we can investigate several key scenarios for the outcome of the coupled P-patch N-strain system. We focus on the global and local factors that promote or hinder coexistence, and on regimes that favour spatial segregation of strains, or ultimately competitive exclusion.

Competition between the sexes for alternative resources can promote evolution of ESD when interspecific competition is reduced (competition hypothesis). Alternatively, sex-specific selection on ecological traits might weaken under strong directional selection in new environments (divergence hypothesis). We tested these hypotheses via their expected evolutionary outcomes in threespine stickleback populations from southwestern Canada. We found striking among-population variation in magnitude of ESD. Consistent with the divergence hypothesis, dimorphism along the main axis of body shape variation was reduced in recently derived freshwater populations compared to their contemporary marine ancestor. However, dimorphism only weakly declined with increasing phenotypic divergence. Average dimorphism along major freshwater body shape axes was similar between solitary populations and those coexisting with a competing species, contrary to the competition hypothesis. Instead, sympatry with a Benthic ecotype led to increased sexual size dimorphism in Limnetics, and total shape dimorphism was elevated in the sympatric stickleback species compared with solitary populations. In contrast to the mechanisms considered in existing theory, interactions in sympatry might produce elevated ESD by generating novel sex-specific selection pressures.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Across their invasive range, N. rufogriseus occupy large landscapes at low densities, making their surveillance challenging. Recent research has demonstrated that airborne environmental DNA (eDNA) can rapidly identify terrestrial vertebrate diversity in an area. Leveraging these findings, we investigate the utility of airborne eDNA for the targeted monitoring of N. rufogriseus, using a novel, probe-based quantitative PCR assay. The effects of filtration material, collection method (active versus passive), distance from the source, and environmental conditions were examined for their effects on airborne detection probability, using a captive population of wallabies in a controlled park setting. A total of 110 airborne samples were collected, 55 with active (battery-powered fan) samplers and 55 passive (non-powered) samplers, across six distinct experimental periods at distances of 0, 10, 100, and 1000 metres from the closest known source of wallaby DNA. Filters designed to capture coarse particles (>10 um) significantly improved detection rates and DNA recovery for actively collected samples, compared to filters targeting finer particles (1-10 um). Active samplers significantly outperformed passive samplers in overall detection rates, particularly at shorter ranges from the target. Distance from the source had a significant negative effect on detection probability. Detection rates declined sharply beyond 10 metres but remained possible up to 1 kilometre from the source for both collection methods. These findings demonstrate that airborne eDNA can detect terrestrial vertebrate species at ecologically relevant distances, supporting its potential for landscape-scale surveillance. Notably, these results underscore the importance of optimising sampler design when applying airborne eDNA for targeted species monitoring.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

The structures reveal a conserved overall architecture and rRNA modification landscape compared to other mammals, and provide an atomic-level view of the unique break in the 28S rRNA. This cleavage event, located in the D6 expansion segment, is structurally stabilized by a network of interactions with surrounding ribosomal proteins, maintaining the integrity of the large subunit. Our comparative analysis revealed that this compensatory network preserves a canonical architecture nearly indistinguishable from intact mouse and human ribosomes.

Kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) agonists and antagonists precisely regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatility, thereby controlling luteinizing hormone (LH) release, steroidogenesis, and fertility. While the KISS1R agonist KP10 accelerates GnRH-LH pulses to promote ovulation, the antagonist KP234 suppresses pulse generation, inducing reversible infertility. However, their poor BBB permeability limits clinical application. Here, we engineered a non-invasive brain delivery platform by covalently coupling the rabies virus glycoprotein derived peptide RVG29 to oxidized chitosan nanoparticles via Schiff base chemistry. Sodium periodate oxidation introduced aldehyde groups, FT-IR confirmed aldehyde formation, and UV-Vis spectroscopy validated RVG29 conjugation through characteristic absorbance shifts. The resulting RVG29-chitosan carriers demonstrated biocompatibility, enhanced neuronal uptake 2.1-fold in vitro, and achieved 2.5-fold higher brain accumulation in vivo compared to unconjugated controls. Systemic delivery of RVG29-chitosan-KP10 restored and amplified LH pulsatility in ovariectomized mice, accelerated estrous cycling, increased preovulatory follicle numbers, and enhanced litter size. In contrast, RVG29-chitosan-KP234 abolished LH pulses, maintained animals in persistent diestrus, depleted corpora lutea, and produced complete yet reversible infertility.

These effects arose at the single-cell level, with right CA3 inputs driving high-amplitude, reliable fields early and left inputs supporting reliable fields later. Axonal recordings revealed a matching shift: right CA3 axons showed greater place-field activity and reliability early, whereas left CA3 axons became more reliable later. Thus, CA3 input dominance transitions from right to left, coordinating CA1R map refinement and stabilization.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

This study aims to investigate whether cerebral hemispheres differentially regulate hepatic glucose metabolism and localize the site of sympathetic crossover to the liver. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) tracing demonstrated symmetric projections from the paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) with preferential innervation of contralateral hepatic lobes. Unilateral LPGi activation elevated systemic glucose through enhanced glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in contralateral lobes, whereas bilateral activation produced additive effects. Following unilateral hepatic denervation, contralateral LPGi activation induced metabolic compensation in the remaining innervated lobes, characterized by increased sympathetic release, glucose production, and glycogen depletion. Whole-mount clearing and dual tracing localized the sympathetic crossover to the porta hepatis, and developmental analysis showed lobar innervation along the vasculature emerging at postnatal week 2. These findings demonstrate that the brain exerts lobe-specific, lateralized control of hepatic glucose metabolism via symmetric brain-liver sympathetic pathways. Contralateral regulation arises from peripheral decussation at the porta hepatis, and compensatory activation following denervation reveals an intrinsic neuroadaptive mechanism that safeguards systemic glucose homeostasis.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

For the larvae of Black Soldier Flies (Hermetia illucens; BSFL), a key species in waste bioconversion, microbiome engineering offers a strategy to enhance growth and disease resistance. We tested whether enriching the BSFL microbiome with microbes from a wild relative, Exaireta spinigera, improves larval performance. Axenic BSFL neonates were inoculated with (1) a captive BSFL microbiome, (2) an E. spinigera microbiome, (3) a mixed inoculum of the two, (4) an environmental, diet derived microbiome, or (5) remained axenic. After two weeks, larvae receiving E. spinigera microbes (alone or mixed) exhibited significantly higher growth and survival compared to those inoculated with the captive microbiome. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed successful establishment of diverse taxa from E. spinigera, including Dysgonomonas, Wohlfahrtiimonas, and Scrofimicrobium, some showing strong association with either the larval gut or frass. Notably, enrichment with the E. spinigera microbiome suppressed a pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain that dominated the captive microbiome and reduced larval survival in mono-inoculation trials. These findings demonstrate that microbiome enrichment from wild relatives can enhance BSFL health and resilience, supporting a top-down approach to probiotic development for industrial insect rearing.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Ports are also expected to be gateways for the spread of NIS in the wild and resemble each other more than communities outside due to their singular characteristics. However, the uniqueness of species assemblages in ports and how they differ from natural habitats have only been marginally investigated, notably at regional scale. Using eDNA metabarcoding, we obtained a comprehensive and standardized overview of metazoan community diversity in 12 paired ports and adjacent natural areas along the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. As expected, we found that NIS are more abundant in ports than in natural habitats, and that the species assemblages in ports differ from those in natural habitats. In addition, we observed that communities in ports are far more homogeneous than their natural counterparts. This finding supports the hypothesis of biotic homogenization in highly anthropized habitats. We also observed a pattern that had previously been documented mainly in fish, but that we identified here in every phylum studied except Arthropoda: species richness detected in ports is comparable to, and in some case even greater than, that observed in natural habitats. Overall, our findings broaden, through an ecological perspective, the 'portuarization syndrome' concept, which originally defined ports as unique replicated environments that promote specific evolutionary processes.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Establishing baseline information on migratory connectivity is important to identify species and regions requiring transboundary cooperation for their conservation. Despite efforts to track migratory sharks and rays, information on transboundary movements is limited and often inaccessible to managers and policymakers. Here, we synthesised multimethod movement data for Australian shark and ray species listed under the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), investigating which species require international engagement to support their population recovery. Based on data from a systematic literature review, we built connectivity networks from telemetry and mark-recapture studies that provide a first transboundary connectivity baseline for Australian sharks and rays. Of the 29 CMS-listed shark and ray species reviewed, we identified 5 species linking the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone to other national jurisdictions via multispecies migratory connections through the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, through the Tasman and Coral Sea to New Caledonia, and north across the Timor Sea and Torres Strait. White sharks (Carcharhinus carcharias) and whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) were the most data rich, while 18 (62%) of species had no movement information. Of note, nearly two-thirds of Endangered or Critically Endangered migratory shark and rays had only one or no published studies. We also show the applicability of this framework to support (or not) listing of migratory species under CMS. We demonstrate that migratory connectivity baselines can support international reporting, direct international collaboration, and focus research efforts on critical knowledge gaps.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

The assembled genome comprises approximately 184,000 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 7.18 Kbp and a high BUSCO completeness score of ~90% encompassing ~22,000 annotated genes. We analysed the paleodemographic histories of nine additional Apocynaceae species using Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) modelling to place these findings in a broader evolutionary context. This comparative analysis revealed a consistent signature of a pronounced bottleneck across the family during the Mid-Pleistocene glaciations, with few notable species showing high adaptive resilience marked by early recovery in effective population size (Ne), while some even showed secondary Ne peaks in the warmer interglacial periods. Although marked by complex and fairly distinct demographic trajectories, most species exhibit stabilised Ne near the onset of the Holocene. The availability of this high-quality draft genome assembly provides an important resource to advance functional, ecological, and comparative genomics in R. serpentina as well as aid heterologous production of pharmaceutically important biomolecules at an industrial scale, thereby alleviating the pressure on wild populations.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

GWAS is generally used, but it suffers from insufficient power, lack of resolution and in-efficiency to systematically screen for epistasis. We propose a systems genetics approach inte-grating multi-omics to overcome these limits. It was applied to a panel of maize with the objec-tive to analyze the genetic determinism of yield in a multi-environment trials by combining genomics with transcriptomics measured on a platform. Results: Despite the contrasted conditions between the platform and the fields, transcriptomics could be used to identify candidate genes. A presence-absence variation was in particular detected, and the transcripts allowed the identification of causal genes, increasing resolution in compari-son to GWAS. In total, 47 genes were identified along the genome, and we could characterize their contrasted effect on yield according to environmental covariates. We demonstrated that the cis- and also the trans-eQTLs of these genes had an important contribution to genetic vari-ance, suggesting a key role of epistatic interactions. In terms of predictive ability, the cis-eQTL resulted in an increase of 39 to 52% on average across the environments, in comparison to ran-dom SNP sets. Conclusions: By efficiently combining multi-omics, it is possible to considerably increase our understanding of genetic architecture in comparison to standard GWAS. We demonstrated that omics data even measured on a phenotyping platform can be used for the analysis of field traits, opening the way for their routine use in plant breeding both for marker-assisted selection and bio-informed predictions.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

In this study, we develop a seven-compartment asthma pollution model incorporating susceptible, carrier, exposed, undiagnosed infected, diagnosed infected, recovered, and pollutant burden compartments. We employ a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework to infer the hidden temporal profiles of key parameters, including the pollution-driven transmission rate ({xi}(t)), environmental progression rate ({lambda}1(t)), pollutant accumulation rate (A(t)), and pollutant depletion rate ({tau}t(t)), from synthetically generated noisy data. The PINN approach integrates the compartmental ODE system via a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver and minimizes a combined loss function capturing both state fidelity and parameter consistency. Evaluation of model performance demonstrates 1 excellent agreement with ground-truth trajectories, achieving mean squared errors below 10 (subscript -4) for all compartments and sub-2% deviation for inferred parameters.

The elongation of the body along a head-to-tail axis is a pivotal event, as it lays the foundation of the body plan. While genetic and biochemical aspects of mammalian body elongation have been uncovered, the physical mechanism of axial morphogenesis remains unknown, largely due to the inaccessibility of the implanted embryo to physical measurements and manipulations in utero. Gastruloids, a stem-cell-based embryo model of mammalian axial morphogenesis, lift such limitations. Combining live imaging, direct mechanical measurements, and chemical and mechanical perturbations, here we show that axis elongation in mouse and human gastruloids is guided by a posterior actin cap at the tissue surface that constrains the expansive forces of cell proliferation. Measurements of mechanical stresses using oil microdroplets, as well as inhibition of cell proliferation and myosin activity, show that the forces driving elongation arise from cell proliferation, and not from convergent extension movements. We find that isotropic tissue expansion is re-directed into posterior elongation by the formation of a supracellular actin cap at the posterior tissue surface that restricts lateral tissue expansion. Finally, we show that posterior elongation in mouse embryos displays the key features of the physical elongation mechanism reported for mouse and human gastruloids. These findings reveal that mammalian body axis elongation, including human, occurs via a different physical mechanism from other vertebrate species.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Using a new >1300 taxon, formally inferred supertree, we show that phylogenetic extinction clustering in early vertebrates varied through time and between major ecomorphological divisions of the tree. At the end of the Silurian and into the Early Devonian, jawless fishes became marginalized components of vertebrate faunas and show more strongly clustered extinction than jawed fishes, which became ecologically dominant during this interval. Clustered extinction (contemporaneous extinction of close relatives) is typical of most stages of the Devonian, particularly during the Late Devonian extinctions. By contrast, the subsequent early Carboniferous interval of putative recovery is characterized by overdispersed extinction (contemporaneous extinction of distant relatives), consistent with widespread persistence of phylogenetically distinct lineages. This work shows how varying patterns of extinction selectivity pruned the vertebrate tree at the time when the first-order patterns of diversity apparent in modern aquatic vertebrate faunas were first established.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Understanding and optimising transgene expression is crucial for a wide variety of applications which range from investigating basic biology, synthetic biology, recombinant protein production to gene therapy. However, precise control over the timing and location of transgene expression remains a key limitation, particularly in therapeutic contexts where specificity and compactness are critical. To address limitations of traditional promoter-based transgene construct approaches, we developed TRANCERs (TRanscriptionally Autonomous enhaNCERs), a modular and compact system that transforms cell type-specific enhancers into standalone sources of productive transcription. To accomplish this, we leveraged basic facets of enhancer function as well as known and novel principles of transcript stability and nuclear export. We demonstrate that TRANCERs can drive lineage-restricted expression of both reporter and therapeutic genes across multiple mammalian cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and that this expression pattern faithfully mirrors the activity of the enhancer element used. Enhancer elements are the most cell type specific element in the mammalian genome and are used to drive development, differentiation and cellular responses to extrinsic signals. Therefore, the TRANCER system allows for the generation of specific stable expression constructs for all conceivable situations for which a native enhancer exists with the required activity pattern. Furthermore, we show that the TRANCER system is compatible with previously published machine learning derived artificial enhancer sequences suggesting the possibility even for specific bespoke expression patterns that do not exist in nature. This, combined with a significantly reduced vector footprint ideal for size-constrained delivery systems such as lentiviral vectors, means that the TRANCER system represent a significant step forward in our ability to control gene expression for both basic biology and therapeutic applications.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we performed one-photon calcium imaging in freely behaving mice to record endogenous activity from the intermediate CA1 (iCA1) and the intermediate CA3 (iCA3) during a novel behavioral paradigm that disentangles social identity from spatial position. Neurons in both subfields encoded social and spatial variables, but iCA3 neurons more robustly discriminated between novel and familiar conspecifics, suggesting that iCA3 neurons more strongly encoded social novelty than those in the iCA1. In contrast, iCA1 neurons more robustly encoded spatial position, indicating distinct roles for these subfields in processing social-context sensitive information. Longitudinal tracking further revealed that social representations remapped across days in both subfields, whereas spatial representations remained stable. These results identify the iCA3 as a key locus for social novelty encoding and suggest a functional division of labor within the hippocampus, in which stable spatial frameworks in the iCA1 anchor flexible, context-dependent social representations in the iCA3 that support adaptive social memory.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Entropy, a measure of system irregularity, has become a powerful tool for quantifying the dynamics of brain activity. While previous fMRI-based brain entropy (BEN) studies have established its relationships with brain morphology (e.g., gray matter volume, GMV) and task activation, the pathway from structure to function remains incompletely understood. Specifically, it is unclear whether controlling for brain morphology (GMV) significantly alters the observed BEN-task activation relationship. In this study, we first replicated key prior findings, including the effects of sex and age on BEN and GMV, their spatial and brain-wide voxel-wise correlations, and the relationship between BEN and task activation across social cognition, reward, and emotion tasks. Subsequently, we examined the correlation between GMV and task activation, as well as the correlation between BEN and task activation after controlling for GMV. Our results successfully replicated previous findings. Crucially, the relationship between BEN and task activation remained largely unchanged after controlling for GMV. This indicates that BEN captures unique variance in task activation beyond what is explained by GMV alone, establishing BEN as a functional bridge linking brain structure to task activation. Future work should employ predictive analyses to quantify the added value of BEN in predicting task activation from structural information.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Yet how ParB condensates preserve their dynamic behavior without collapsing into a single droplet has remained unclear. Here, we combined inducible chromosome degradation with quantitative imaging to dissect the kinetics and physical principles governing ParB condensate dynamics in vivo. In the absence of the nucleoid, ParB condensates diffuse freely and coalesce within seconds upon encounter, following Brownian first-encounter statistics. Strikingly, condensates operate near the fusion-separation boundary, such that minimal energy is sufficient to split droplets after replication, thereby preventing irreversible coalescence. Using different mutants, we further show that proper condensate assembly is essential for coalescence. These findings uncover a dual role of ParA: beyond tethering condensates to the nucleoid to limit mobility and prevent uncontrolled fusion, ParA also promotes a ParB state competent for condensate assembly and thus coalescence, likely by enhancing ParB-ParB interactions. Finally, condensates rapidly disassemble and reassemble upon 1,6-hexanediol treatment, underscoring their reversible, dynamic nature and the stabilizing contribution of ParB-DNA interactions. Together, our results establish ParB partition complexes as bona fide biocondensates and reveal how their dynamics are finely tuned by ParA to ensure robust and faithful DNA segregation.

Using CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair, we generated a Y-linked betaTub85D-Cas9-T2A-eGFP construct and compared its activity with an autosomal counterpart. Whereas autosomal betaTub85D-Cas9 induced strong male-biased sex ratios when paired with an X-poisoning gRNA, the Y-linked construct failed to distort sex ratios and exhibited approximately 2,000-fold reduction in Cas9 transcript abundance. Nonetheless, weak but detectable GFP fluorescence and Cas9 transcripts confirmed partial Y-linked promoter activity.

To infer the genetic diversity and demographic history of the Philippine Eagle, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 35 individuals under the captive breeding program of the Philippine Eagle Foundation. Phylogenetic analysis of the draft reference sequence generated in this study placed P. jefferyi within the subfamily Circaetinae of Accipitridae. Demographic history reconstruction from genome-wide variants revealed two historical bottlenecks, as well as an ongoing population decline which was found to predate documented deforestation in the Philippines.

Genome-wide heterozygosity estimates placed the Philippine Eagle as having one of the lowest genome-wide heterozygosity levels measured among raptors. This highlights the precarious genetic state of the Philippine Eagle, as critically low heterozygosity raises risks of inbreeding depression, reduced reproductive success, and increased vulnerability to diseases, climate change, and habitat loss. The genomic resources generated in this study can therefore guide conservation strategies such as breeding program design, genetic monitoring, and other efforts to diversify existing populations to ensure both demographic stability and genetic resilience of the Philippine Eagle.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Z.; Hsu, T.-Y.", "abstract": "Human cognition involves continuous transitions between processing information guided by the external world and engaging with internally-generated thoughts, yet research has predominantly investigated switching based on external rules. We therefore examined neural mechanisms underlying external and internal domain switching using independent groups of EEG (N=46) and fMRI (N=60) in a colour judgement task requiring evaluations based on either colour similarity (external domain) or colour preference (internal domain) through switching on a trial-by-trial basis. ERPs revealed amplitude differences between the two judgements as well as switching and repeated trials. EEG analysis revealed a sustained neural differentiation between switch and repeated trials, specifically during similarity judgments, with effects lasting from early time points through the entire trial duration. fMRI showed similarity judgements engaged visual and motor regions during switching, while preference judgements showed minimal subcortical activation for repeated trials. These findings demonstrate that external and internal cognitive domain switching effects are asymmetrical. These findings provide the first temporal and spatial neural characterisation of domain switching between processing information guided by the external world and internally-generated thoughts, indicating that shifting between internal and external domains involves mechanisms distinct from traditional external rule-switching paradigms.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Individuals use language every day to communicate their thoughts, emotions and expectations to those around them. Communication also incorporates receiving continuous and complex streams of information, not all of which is easily predictable. The memory literature suggests that this unexpected information may be processed more effectively when an individual possesses an adequate schema of the local context. We propose that, in language comprehension, we can determine the presence of a relevant scheme via an alignment metric, which compares an individual's brain response to language (N400 amplitudes) with an expected response as determined by the probabilistic contingencies of the current context (surprisal). When alignment is higher, an individual's internal model of the world is assumed to closely mirror the environment, constituting an effective schema. The present study sought to explore how individuals process unexpected information and whether successful comprehension is related to the alignment of internal predictive models to the external environment. It was hypothesised that higher alignment would support better comprehension of unexpected information than lower alignment. 40 participants (27F; mean age: 24.6 years; SD: 5.94) listened to 12 short stories (3 genres, audio presentation) while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Comprehension was tested via 6 multiple choice questions per story. A comprehension linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was computed for two regions of interest and two predictability metrics (N400 amplitudes and surprisal). A functional role of unexpectedness was demonstrated in all four models, where greater unexpectedness was related to higher comprehension scores. In one model we observed a significant interaction between alignment and average N400 amplitudes, indicating that comprehension was better for more unexpected stories when there was lower alignment to expected contextual probabilities. Our results suggest that individuals can utilise unexpected information to support language comprehension and that there are conditions where successful integration of this information is more likely. Contrary to our expectations, lower alignment to the current probabilistic conditions led to a greater capacity to utilise unexpected information. Future research should explore whether lower alignment reflects an individual's openness to integrate new information into existing schemas and how this impacts comprehension of unexpected language.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Deletion of residues 363-379 in the intracellular M3-4 loop caused receptor clustering in intracellular compartments and abolished learning-induced redistribution without altering receptor function or immediate memory recall. Interestingly, animals expressing the truncated receptor failed to retrieve aversive memories one hour after training, revealing a role for receptor trafficking in memory stability.

Genetic variations in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region are strongly associated with IBD; nonetheless, the functional consequences of this variation on the composition of T-cell receptors remain poorly understood. Methods: We conducted comprehensive CDR3-QTL mapping using T-cell receptor beta (TRB) repertoires paired with HLA allotypes from 1,973 individuals, including 1,201 individuals with IBD and 772 healthy controls (HCs), to explore the role of the HLA allelic variants on TRB composition. Using network analyses, we defined key CDR3 motifs of public clones that were linked to risk HLA alleles for chronic inflammatory diseases. Results: We identified novel sites within both HLA class I and class II proteins that were strongly linked to TRB amino acid composition, namely cdr3QTLs, in both HCs and individuals with IBD. Those sites in HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ had stronger effects on CDR3 composition than did the disease in the IBD cohort. In HCs, but not in UC or CD, the strongest HLA signals that affected expanded clones, overlapped with primary CD risk loci from GWAS, e.g., DRB1 site 70 and DQA1 site 25. The strongest CD-specific effects on TRB composition were found in HLA-B, especially at sites that modulate viral responses (e.g., HLA-B sites 9, 67). Finally, the main risk HLA alleles for chronic inflammatory diseases clustered together based on the physicochemical properties of residues mapped to cdr3QTLs, suggesting that risk alleles might exert similar effects on the TRB repertoire. Conclusion: Structurally, the main cdr3QTLs in both HLA class I/II are located in peptide-binding sites or sites contacting TCRs, highlighting their direct and antigen-mediated influences on TRB repertoires. Our findings suggest that cdr3QTLs in HLA class I exert IBD-specific effects on the TRB composition, influencing the dysregulated T cell responses implicated in IBD pathogenesis, possibly on the earlier stages of T cell development. While HLA class II cdr3QTLs show universal effects and strong associations with T-cell receptors, irrespective of disease.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, macrophages expressing different combinations of chemokine receptors are transcriptionally distinct, suggesting non-redundant functions for CCR1, 2 and 5. Finally, we examined changes in macrophage chemokine receptor expression in vitro after treatment with varied TLR ligands, and show that CCR1 is specifically increased in response to bacterial but not viral ligands.

Coffee, one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, has been epidemiologically linked to a reduced risk of several cancers, including melanoma. It contains bioactive compounds with reported anti-cancer properties; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its potential protective effects against melanoma remain insufficiently explored. Plant-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising natural nanocarriers due to their high stability, cellular uptake efficiency, and low toxicity. Here, we report the first comparative investigation of EVs isolated from unroasted and roasted Coffea arabica beans and their anti-cancer effects on SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells. Both EV types selectively reduced SK-MEL-28 cell viability, induced apoptosis, suppressed tumor spheroid growth, and impaired cellular migration. Mechanistically, unroasted coffee EVs downregulated SERPINA1 and inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway, whereas roasted coffee EVs attenuated MAPK signaling by reducing BRAF phosphorylation.

The current study synthesized 12 years (2012-2024) of monitoring data, including systematic, extensive camera trap surveys across 27 distinct sampling sessions in eight reserves (69,089 trap nights) supplemented by published records of cheetah occurrences on social media to assess the demographic and spatial patterns of this critically endangered subspecies. Our analysis indicates that a total of 24 adult Asiatic cheetahs were identified across the Northern and Southern Landscapes. However, no evidence of reproduction or new individual presence was obtained in the Southern Landscape for over a decade. Meanwhile, the Northern Landscape hosts the remaining population, likely fewer than 30 individuals. Between 2020 and 2024, at least 31 cubs were born in the northern population from six females. However, limited evidence of successful recruitment suggests minimal contribution to population recovery, as only 47.3% of monitored cubs survived beyond their first year. Asiatic cheetahs exhibit extensive mobility across the arid Northern Landscape, frequently traversing unprotected communal lands and a major highway, which increases their vulnerability. While camera trap data have proven effective for individual identification, they are limited in tracking fine-scale movement, emphasizing the urgent need for satellite telemetry. Interventions such as roadside fencing and wildlife underpasses along highways are essential to reduce mortality. These efforts should be complemented by broader conservation measures, including habitat protection and restoration, community-based management of unprotected lands, and enhanced anti-trafficking enforcement. Genetic concerns, especially low effective population size and inbreeding, pose additional threats to viability.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Results highlight that monoxenous, extracellular trypanosomatids originated from predatory ancestors through reductive evolution, which diminished their metabolic and hunting capabilities. Intracellularity and dixenous lifestyle convergently originated three times independently. Progressive consolidation of genes into polycistronic transcription units (PTUs) was a central innovation that began in early Glycomonada and expanded through chromosome fission-fusion and gene relocation/inversion. In present-day PTUs, protein complex subunits and metabolic pathway enzymes are positioned for co-expression in temporal synchrony, and chromosomes minimize colinear PTUs to counter transcriptional readthrough.

While obligate symbi-onts have been extensively characterized in insects feeding on nutritionally poor diets, the diversity and functional roles of facultative bacterial symbionts remain largely unexplored in many insect lineages, including scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha). Here, we present a genome-resolved metagenomic and comparative genomic analysis of facultative bacterial symbionts across 120 scale insect metagenomes from 20 different families. Our analyses reveal rich and taxonomically diverse facultative symbiont communities, dominated by the Pseudomonadota, such as Wolbachia, Rickettsia, Arsenophonus, and Sodalis. Genomic features reveal substantial variation in genome sizes, coding densities, metabolic potentials, and host-interaction genes among symbiont clades, indicating lineage-specific lifestyles and host interactions. Interestingly, alphaproteobacterial and gammaproteobacterial symbionts mostly co-occur within their respective hosts. Gammaproteobacterial symbionts exhibit broader metabolic reper-toires and potential defense capabilities via the APSE phage toxin cassettes, while alphaproteobacterial symbionts retain reduced metabolic capabilities, Type IV secretion systems, and reproductive manipulation genes (cifAB and wmk).

We show that supplementation with a membrane-domain-dissolving antibiotic lowers the susceptibility of both a MRSA clinical isolate and the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) to multiple {beta}-lactams several folds. In particular, full reversal of resistance to oxacillin and penicillin in MRSA is achieved. We provide evidence on the nano-scale (atomic force microscopy), living bacteria (fluorescence microscopy), and bacterial cultures (microbiology assays) that the {beta}-lactam resistance reversal is linked to dissolution of membrane domains. A general nature of this principle is expected, and could be applied using various membrane-domain-dissolving antibiotics to reverse {beta}-lactam resistance in various bacteria.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

We used stable isotope labelling (deuterium oxide; D2O) in vivo, and peptide mass spectrometry of muscle samples to investigate differences in proteome dynamics between the muscle of younger (28 {+/-} 5 y; n=4) and older (69 {+/-} 3 y; n=4) men during either habitual activity or resistance exercise training. We quantified the abundance of 1787 proteins and the turnover rate of 1046 proteins in bi-lateral samples of vastus lateralis (n=32 samples total) taken before and after a 15-day program including 5 sessions of unilateral leg-press exercise (3 sets of 10 repetitions at 90% of 10 RM). Our protein abundance profiling revealed a stoichiometric imbalance within the proteostasis network in aged skeletal muscle, including subunits of eIF3, subunits of 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins. The rate of bulk, mixed-protein synthesis was not different between younger and older men, but most ribosomal proteins were less abundant in the muscle of older participants, suggesting ribosomes in older muscle may exhibit increased translational efficiency to maintain similar levels of protein turnover compared to ribosomes in younger muscle. Resistance exercise partially restored age-related disruptions to the proteostasis network. In older skeletal muscle, resistance exercise specifically increased the absolute turnover rate (ATR) of mixed mitochondrial proteins, with increased fractional turnover rate (FTR) of prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and profilin-1 (PROF1), and increased abundance of prohibitin 2 (PHB2). These adaptations may suggest resistance exercise promotes mitochondrial proteostasis by facilitating the synthesis and maintenance of key mitochondrial proteins. Thus, our Dynamic Proteome Profiling data provide an impetus for further exploration of the role of proteostasis in maintaining skeletal muscle quality and supports resistance exercise as a potential therapeutic strategy to promote healthy skeletal muscle ageing in humans.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Impaired FGF-21/KLB signaling has been linked to metabolic disorders, but its role in hypertension remains unclear. Objective: This study investigated the expression of genes related to the FGF-21 signaling axis (FGF-21, FGFR1, and KLB) in the liver and central nervous system (CNS) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at pre-hypertensive (21 days) and hypertensive (90 days) stages. Methods: Systolic tail pressure (STP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded by tail-cuff plethysmography. Gene expression in the liver, brainstem, hypothalamus, and frontal cortex was quantified by RT-qPCR and normalized to {beta}-actin. Results: SHR-90d exhibited significantly higher STP compared to SHR-21d, with no difference in HR. Hepatic KLB mRNA expression was markedly reduced in SHR-90d compared to SHR-21d, while FGF-21 and FGFR1 levels remained unchanged. No significant alterations in FGF-21 pathway genes were detected in CNS regions.

This increase in body temperature is accelerating senescence, thereby weakening immune responses and reproductive processes, and shortening lifespan. To determine how warmer temperature and aging, individually and interactively, shape the transcriptome of the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, we conducted RNA-sequencing and network-analysis in naive and immune-induced mosquitoes that had been reared at 27C, 30C or 32C and were 1, 5, 10 or 15 days into adulthood. Results: We demonstrate that immune induction, warmer temperature, and aging alter the transcriptome. Notably, the transcriptome of 1-day-old mosquitoes is pronouncedly different from older mosquitoes, and importantly, warmer temperature modifies the aging-dependent changes to accelerate senescence. For example, warmer temperature amplifies the aging-dependent decrease in immune gene expression but dampens both the aging-dependent decrease in metabolic gene expression and the aging-dependent increase in DNA repair gene expression.

In this study, we used a validated self-related learning task to investigate how internal versus external attributions of performance feedback affect the formation of self-beliefs and how these processes relate to depressive symptoms and self-esteem. Drawing on a computational model that incorporates prediction error valence and causal attributions, we found that participants updated their self-beliefs less when feedback was attributed to external causes. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem showed a stronger negativity bias in learning. Lower self-esteem was also linked to a reduced self-serving bias in attributions.

However, their effectiveness can be limited in noisy environments, for fine frequency resolution, and in patients lacking an intact auditory nerve. The auditory cortex offers a promising alternative target for neuroprosthetic stimulation, but it remains unclear whether direct cortical input can evoke percepts with the complexity and structure of natural sounds. Here we show that surface cortical implants in mice support robust and flexible auditory behaviour, surpassing cochlear implants in tasks requiring fine spectral, temporal, and noise-resistant discrimination. We also show that animals generalize seamlessly between cortical and acoustic stimuli without additional training, indicating that cortical stimulation can generate interpretable, sound-like percepts. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that cortical stimulation drives spatially and temporally structured neural activity in auditory cortex, resembling responses to natural sound. These findings establish that the auditory cortex can interpret spatially and temporally patterned electrical input in a behavioural relevant way.

NNMT KD restored methylation balance by increasing the SAM/SAH ratio and H3K27me3 levels, and abrogated TGFb-induced profibrotic programs regulating ECM production and collagen synthesis. Mechanistically, NNMT was required for TGFb-induced upregulation of the transcription factors ATF4, SOX9, and SRF, which together orchestrate ECM gene expression and COL1A1 secretion. Interpretation: These findings define a previously unrecognized TGFb-NNMT-ATF4/SOX9/SRF axis that coordinates profibrotic transcriptional programs in DFs. Accordingly, NNMT functions as a central effector linking TGFb signaling to DF activation and ECM remodelling. Targeting NNMT may thus represent a promising therapeutic strategy to attenuate skin fibrosis in SSc.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

However, cultured hPSCs quickly acquire chromosome gains or losses (aneuploidy) due to high replicative stress and errors in chromosome segregation, which hampers their use for stem cell therapies. We have recently described that embryo patterning signals control chromosome segregation fidelity during early human lineage specification by modulating the response to replicative stress. Here, we demonstrate that fine-tuned activation of WNT signalling using off-the-shelf GSK3 inhibitors prevents chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy during long term passaging of hPSCs. Lineage-specification and sequencing analyses demonstrate that hPSCs culture with E8 supplemented with a low dosage of GSK3 inhibitors retain primed pluripotency and full potential to the differentiation into the 3 germ layers for over 30 passages. Strikingly, detailed mitotic studies revealed that long-term cultured hPSCs often display ultra-fine chromosome bridges during anaphase due to unreplicated DNA, which can result in hitherto uncharacterised copy-number-variations and other genomic aberrations. We show that culture with low dosage of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021, but not direct attenuation of DNA replication stress using nucleosides, prevents mitotic DNA synthesis and the formation of ultra-fine bridges during long term hPSC passage. Taken together, we propose to enrich E8 culture media with 100 nM CHIR99021 to maintain euploidy in primed hPSCs, and to routinely map for genomic alterations, in addition to aneuploidy, for modelling and regenerative medicine studies", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The genetic dissection of complex traits remains a major challenge in basic and biomedical research, but is essential for understanding the molecular pathways that shape phenotypic variation and for developing predictive models of trait and disease susceptibility. Here, we leverage a novel multiparent mapping population of budding yeast, CYClones, comprising 9,344 haploid strains derived from eight genetically diverse founders, to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and systematically investigate the genetic architecture of growth rates across ten environmental conditions. In total, we identified 349 QTL (ranging from 19 to 49 QTL per growth condition) that explained between 61% and 100% of narrow sense heritability across traits. The high power and resolution of CYClones revealed that growth traits exhibited distinct, condition-specific genetic architectures with extensive allelic heterogeneity, where a QTL was the result of multiple tightly linked causal variants. We also observed pleiotropy among QTL with complex, trait-dependent allele effects that are also consistent with allelic heterogeneity. Genetic complexity varied widely, with some traits showing nearly Mendelian architectures, while others were highly polygenic. Introgressed loci played a prominent role in the landscape of growth rate QTL, including one that is localized to a 2.4 kb interval in the PCA1 cadmium transporter and explains 72% of variation in cadmium resistance and another large-effect QTL that alters growth on galactose via complex non-additive interactions with the transcriptional regulator GAL3. In both cadmium and galactose conditions, we show that allelic variation at a small number of loci stratifies the population into regulatory or physiological subgroups, each with distinct genetic architectures, a phenomenon we term allele-dependent stratification. Collectively, our results provide novel insights into the genetics of growth rates in budding yeast, the architectural features of genetic complexity, and demonstrate that CYClones is a powerful platform for revealing the molecular basis of complex trait variation.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Annexin A11 (ANXA11), a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, functions as a tether linking RNA granules to lysosomes, aiding mRNA transport for rapid neuronal responses. Structurally, its N-terminal (Nt) binds RNA, while the C-terminal (Ct) associates with lysosomal membranes. Mutations in ANXA11 linked to Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may disrupt this function. Here, applying a multidisciplinary approach, we revealed that Ca2+ acts as a master regulator of ANXA11 physiological function by modulating its conformational states. Specifically, Ca2+ influences a switch between two conformations: a close state, in which the Nt and Ct interact with each other, and an open state, which occurs in the presence of Ca2+ ions, where this self-interaction is disrupted, allowing the two domains to interact freely with RNA and liposomes. Surprisingly, we observed that both the Ct and Nt are capable of interacting with liposomes and RNA in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and these interactions can occur simultaneously. This dual binding and its calcium-regulated hierarchy finely tunes ANXA11 binding to RNA and lysosomes, promoting a large complex essential for overcoming transport steric hindrance. Moreover, our result showed that the p.D40G mutation, in the Nt domain, associated with ALS, displays destabilized interdomain interactions and bypass Ca2+ regulation, leading to aberrant aggregation. These insights advance our understanding of ANXA11 role in neuronal RNA transport and its disruption in neurodegeneration, highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Early metastatic dissemination and rich desmoplastic stroma limit therapeutic efficacy, and the discovery of new treatment approaches that will target these obstacles is of great importance. Nischarin (NISCH)/Imidazoline-1 receptor (IR-1) is a potential tumor suppressor, that is involved in the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and cytoskeletal organization. Importantly, several FDA-approved agonists target this receptor. This study aimed to examine the expression of NISCH in PDAC and the effects of its agonists with the intent of drug repurposing. NISCH was expressed in PDAC tumor tissue, in both the epithelial and stromal compartments of tumors, and higher NISCH expression was associated with longer patient survival. Out of the three tested NISCH agonists, rilmenidine was the most potent and could induce cancer cell apoptosis. Rilmenidine treatment induced transcriptional changes in cancer cells associated with so far reported NISCH function and decreased their adhesion and migration in vitro. In CAFs, rilmenidine treatment decreased the expression of activation markers and limited cancer cell-CAF cytokine communication in co-culture. Ultimately, in the in vivo tumor xenograft zebrafish model, rilmenidine reduced the metastatic spread of pancreatic cancer cells. Our results suggest that NISCH agonist rilmenidine is a promising candidate for drug repurposing as an antimetastatic agent in PDAC and that NISCH can be a potential target for the development of new PDAC therapeutics.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

These overlap with attentional or cognitive control brain networks. The literature is short on data speaking to specific neurocognitive functions of these broad brain networks in reappraisal - a key emotion regulatory strategy involving the reframing of an event according to a goal to increase or decrease experienced emotion. We address this gap by examining both the spatial configuration and temporal profile of event-related blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses during a task requiring reappraisal. We analysed fMRI datasets obtained from 84 participants (51% female) who were instructed to increase or decrease their emotional response to unpleasant images. We extracted spatial maps and their estimated temporal event-related BOLD signal changes of four components with the highest loadings. Neurocognitive functions were derived by mapping each component onto templates of previously identified task-based cognitive modes. This analysis yielded four cognitive modes: 1) multiple demand, 2) response, 3) re-evaluation, and 4) default mode. The temporal profiles showed particularly prominent patterns for the increase and decrease conditions in multiple demand (mode 1) and re-evaluation (mode 3) respectively. These findings highlight a central role for specific neurocognitive processes linked to attentional control (multiple demand) and switching (re-evaluation), as part of the broad brain networks supporting reappraisal. Moreover, the level of neural engagement of these cognitive modes varies depending on the regulatory goal. These findings provide tangible targets for neurocognitive interventions such as neurostimulation when emotion regulation is compromised.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

The chemotaxis machinery is typically arranged in highly ordered polar arrays containing an assortment of chemoreceptors and signal transduction proteins. Pseudomonas putida is a polarly flagellated soil bacterium that displays a chemotactic response towards numerous organic compounds present in the rhizosphere. In this work we demonstrate the involvement of the polar landmark proteins FimV, ParC and ParP in the polar assembly of the flagellar motility-associated chemosensory arrays. Confocal microscopy of fluorescent protein fusions and image analysis provide evidence that FimV, ParC, ParP are sequentially recruited to the new cell pole during the cell cycle. This recruitment hierarchy is supported by the observations that FimV is required for ParC localization and FimV and ParC stimulate ParP localization. Bacterial two-hybrid assays suggest the involvement of direct interactions between the three proteins. Our results also show that ParC displays a pole-to-pole oscillatory behavior that results in asymmetric inheritance after cell division. Analysis of the location of the chemoreceptors Aer1 and Aer2 and the histidine kinase CheA illustrates the central role of ParC and ParP in the assembly of polar chemosensory arrays, as both proteins are required for polar recruitment of Aer1 and Aer2 and further promote stable association between CheA and the chemoreceptors at the cell poles.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we characterize BVL3572S, a hydroxamic acid-containing compound that is bactericidal and potently inhibits the growth of both extracellular and intracellular Mtb. Integrated transcriptomic, genetic, and biochemical analyses identified the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferases HisC (Rv1600) and AlaA (Rv0337c; formerly AspC) as the primary molecular targets of BVL3572S, thereby simultaneously impacting L-histidine and L-alanine biosynthesis. Spontaneous resistance mutants harbored mutations in hisC or alaA. Target engagement was further supported by overexpression studies: AlaA overexpression increased resistance in the presence of L-His whereas HisC overexpression paradoxically increased susceptibility. X-ray crystallography revealed a covalent adduct between PLP and BVL3572S within the HisC active site. The short occupancy of this adduct suggests a futile cycle that sequesters PLP. Isotopic labeling revealed widespread perturbation of amino acid biosynthesis, consistent with PLP starvation. The stepwise resistance observed upon supplementation with L-His and L-Ala together or with PLP alone suggests inhibition of multiple targets. Genome-scale CRISPRi and Tn-seq analyses additionally indicated disruptions in central metabolism, cell envelope integrity, and redox balance, possibly due to PLP depletion cascades. Consistent with its inhibition of AlaA, BVL3572S displayed strong synergy with D-cycloserine, a second-line antitubercular drug targeting D-alanine synthesis and impacting peptidoglycan synthesis, highlighting the potential of this compound in combination therapy.

Flocculation is a highly regulated process requiring both type IV pilus activity and the production of extracellular polysaccharides. Under standard laboratory conditions flocculation often slows culture growth, and its physiological advantages remain unclear. Proposed benefits include self-shading as protection from excess light exposure and flotation in the water column. Here, we determine whether flocculation can serve as a method of defense against bacterial predation. Using the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we show that flocculation is strongly triggered by exposure to live cells of \"foreign\" bacteria, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The established P. aeruginosa virulence arsenal includes bacterial warfare systems for competition for resources and acquisition of nutrients by way of interbacterial competition. Here, we establish the use of these strategies for direct predation, via the use of Type VI Secretion Systems. Comparisons of P. aeruginosa co-cultures with either wild type Synechocystis or a non-flocculating mutant revealed that Synechocystis flocculation minimizes both growth of P. aeruginosa and cell lysis of Synechocystis. This in turn reduces the impact of P. aeruginosa on Synechocystis growth by mechanistically limiting the photosynthetic products that P. aeruginosa can access. From these data, we propose that the type VI secretion system of P. aeruginosa can be used for predation and that the primary function of cyanobacterial flocculation is for defense against microbial predation.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Among the five members of the SERINC family, SERINC3 and SERINC1 exhibit modest antiviral activity, whereas SERINC2 lacks this function. HIV-1 counteracts SERINC5 by promoting its endocytosis in a Nef-dependent manner. SERINC5 is also downregulated by glycoGag of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMLV) and by the S2 glycoprotein of equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV). Here, we demonstrate that all human SERINCs, despite their differing antiviral potencies, are incorporated into HIV-1 virions. SERINC5 is the most sensitive to viral antagonists, whereas its paralogs display moderate (SERINC2, SERINC3) or no (SERINC1) susceptibility, suggesting that SERINC5 has exerted stronger selective pressure on retroviral evolution. To identify the determinants of SERINC5 sensitivity to Nef, we performed structure-guided mutagenesis and identified a critical tri-cysteine motif (Cys355, Cys356, Cys358) within intracellular loop 4 (ICL4) required for Nef-mediated downregulation. Substitution of these residues with glutamines conferred resistance to Nef antagonism. While this motif is essential for SERINC5 internalization by diverse HIV-1 and SIV Nef alleles, it is dispensable for downregulation by MoMLV glycoGag and EIAV S2, indicating that these viral antagonists exploit distinct structural features of SERINC5. Finally, we show that SERINC5 is palmitoylated at the tri-cysteine motif, raising the possibility that this modification modulates its sensitivity to Nef. Together, these results confirm the central role of SERINC5 as a target of retroviral counteraction and highlight the crucial importance of ICL4 in mediating its engagement by Nef.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

In early development, the IFN-I pathway is inactive, yet its underlying regulation is poorly understood. Here, we use depletion of the HUSH complex in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a tool to investigate epigenetic control of the IFN-I system in early development. We confirmed that human iPSCs display an attenuated IFN-I pathway, whereas iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) respond robustly to IFN-I pathway agonists. We found that, in iPSCs, depletion of MPP8, a core component of all HUSH complexes, was sufficient to induce both expression of young LINE-1 elements and genes linked to the IFN system including double-stranded RNA sensors and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISG upregulation had little effect on pluripotency markers and occurred without IFN signalling, suggesting that, in contrast to differentiated cells, these ISGs are direct transcriptional targets of the HUSH complex in early development. Chromatin profiling by CUT&Tag confirmed MPP8 enrichment at HUSH-regulated ISGs and revealed a bimodal binding profile of MPP8 to both ISGs and non-ISGs, the latter largely driven by young LINE-1 elements. We propose that shutdown of the IFN-I system in pluripotent stem cells is essential to prevent lethality from unwarranted self-nucleic acid sensing. This shutdown is achieved through a triple-layer of epigenetic lockdown acting on ligands, sensors, and effectors across the IFN-I pathway. Pluripotent cells, therefore, represent a ground state of immune evasion that cancer cells may evolve towards through increasing expression of MPP8.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

The post-translational modification of tubulin is one means by which microtubule function can be tuned to match different cellular activities. While multiple sites of acetylation have been identified in tubulin, particularly -tubulin, the effect of acetylation at different sites on microtubule function remains poorly characterized. Here, we took a genetic approach in Drosophila to disrupt three conserved sites of acetylation (K326, K370, K401) in endogenous -tubulin and characterized the effects on neuronal development. Acetylation-blocking mutagenesis of -tubulin K326 (K326A) perturbed larval locomotion and reduced axon terminal growth at the neuromuscular junction. These deficits were accompanied by a reduction in stable microtubules, suggesting that the -tubulin K326A mutation exerts its effect by disrupting microtubule stability. In contrast, mutagenesis of -tubulin K370 and K401 had virtually no effect on microtubule stability, suggesting that the effects of these mutations on axon terminal morphogenesis and survival may be mediated through a different mechanism. Altogether, the varied effects of these mutations suggests that acetylation at these three different sites may regulate different aspects of microtubule function within developing neurons.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Understanding the adaptive responses of plants to water-deficit stress has therefore become a central challenge in plant biotechnology. Considerable evidence indicates that late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins contribute to water-deficit stress tolerance and the stabilization of metabolic enzymes, yet the molecular basis of these responses remains unknown. To date, limited direct evidence for specific in vivo interactions between LEA proteins and their molecular targets has been reported. Here, we identify for the first time the native in vivo interactome of three Arabidopsis dehydrin LEA proteins - LEA4 (COR47), LEA5 (ERD10), and LEA10 (ERD14) - expressed under their own promoters and in response to salt stress. Our results show that LEA4, LEA5, and LEA10 dehydrins interact with each other, and share six common candidate protein interactors, suggesting that they form a core protein complex in salt stress conditions. We confirmed the direct protein-protein interaction between LEA5 with LEA4, LEA10, OSCA3, PLD1, PIP2B and OST1/AHA1 at the biochemical level. Phenotypic analyses of loss-of-function genetic mutants revealed that the interactions of LEA5 with OSCA3 and PIP2B promote seed germination under salt stress. LEA5 interaction with PLD1 promotes root growth under salt stress, while its interaction with PIP2B enhances root growth under osmotic stress, indicating distinct stress-specific functional roles for each interaction. In conclusion, this study identifies the native in vivo interactions of three dehydrin proteins, while uncovering the functional relevance of these interactions under salt and osmotic stress conditions, thus providing novel mechanistic insights into the role of LEA proteins in water-deficit stress adaptation.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Despite intact mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, tau-expressing fly neurons preferentially utilize glycolysis for ATP production and operate with diminished metabolic reserve. Crucially, this metabolic reprogramming drives rather than protects against pathology as genetic suppression of glycolysis or lactate dehydrogenase completely rescued tau-induced lethality. Further, Gompertz mortality analysis revealed that hyperactive glycolysis in tau neurons drives premature lethality by accelerating biological aging rate without affecting baseline mortality.

We assess the impact of combining different Spike protein's S1 subunit antigens, due to its recognised immunogenic potential, and adjuvants on serum antibody titres, virus neutralizing capabilities, and inter-antigen immune responses. We report a robust and broad antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses, which was amplified by different adjuvant formulations, including alum, MPLA, CpG, and Squalene-in-Water Emulsion.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

To correctly determine the contributions of each fluorophore's signal to the high parameter data an accurate unmixing matrix needs to be generated. Even with single-stained controls, however, these matrixes include errors such as spillover spread, which compounds with each additional parameter, functionally limiting panel design. An additional source of errors is heterogeneity of cellular autofluorescence, which can affect both the unmixing matrix and misalign signals when the matrix is applied to individual cells in complex cell mixtures. Here we developed AutoSpectral, a statistical approach to automate the production of minimal-residual error unmixing matrixes and pair multiple distinct multifluorescent spectra to individual cells within a mixed sample, via an R-based software tool. AutoSpectral improves unmixing accuracy, improving incorrectly assigned cell positions by up to 9000-fold, reduces spread, particularly in samples with variable autofluorescence, and allows multi-lineage analysis of mixed populations, providing superior data for spectral flow cytometry experiments.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 13 essential components of the electron transport chain (ETC). A typical cell contains ~1000s of copies of mtDNA, but how this copy number is stably maintained is unclear. Here, we track mtDNA copy number (mtCN) recovery in K562 cells following transient, chemically induced depletion to uncover principles of mtCN stability. Below a critical mtCN, ETC activity fails to sustain the proton motive force (PMF) and de novo pyrimidine synthesis - both required for mtDNA replication. PMF-dependent processes like Fe-S cluster biogenesis are also disrupted and stress responses are activated that impair cell proliferation and limit further mtCN dilution by cell division. Nonetheless, mtDNA replication and recovery remain possible via mtDNA-independent PMF, generated by complex V reversal, and uridine salvage. Once mtCN is restored, the ETC and forward complex V activity re-engage, stress responses subside, and proliferation recommences. Each cell division then dilutes mtDNA, serving as a built-in brake on mtCN. Our findings suggest that mtCN homeostasis emerges from the balance of two opposing PMF-driven processes - mtDNA replication and cell proliferation - revealing a bioenergetic logic that preserves mtDNA euploidy through repeated cell divisions.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

However, recent work has provided examples of closely related small molecules that act super-additively when-administered, a phenomenon that is difficult to explain using this approach.

To mitigate this effect, we used computational design to install a substrate recruitment domain (SRD) onto the promiscuous enzyme, tyrosinase. The redesigned tyrosinase, called D42, preferentially modifies tyrosine residues within the peptide core (core) linked to a 6-amino acid recognition motif/sequence (RS) specific for the SRD. Incorporation of the recognition sequence along with a neighboring tyrosine in peptides or proteins allows for rapid D42-mediated conversion of the tyrosine to an orthoquinone, which can be selectively modified with a variety of nucleophiles.

P.; Ferreira, T.; O'Brien, J.", "abstract": "Although chemical and electrical synapses function fundamentally differently, they evidently share common design principles. Like neurotransmitter receptors, Connexin 36 (Cx36) containing gap junction channels, key constituents of electrical synapses, are anchored to scaffolding proteins that stabilize the connexin at the synapse. One of the most prominent proteins that has been described in this context is the Zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1). ZO-1 interacts with Cx36 via one of its three PDZ domains. This interaction is inherently weak and was suggested to facilitate the dynamic regulation of electrical synapses. In the present study, we have combined Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and binding assays to identify the exact residues in the PDZ binding motif of Cx36 that are necessary to sustain these low affinity interactions. Among the different Cx36 mutations we have generated, we discovered a single substitution at position 319 within the PDZ binding motif that massively increases binding in different experimental settings. In addition to this site, we found that acidic residues adjacent to the PDZ binding motif (PBM) in Cx36 and its fish orthologues are evolutionarily tuned to weaken PDZ interactions as well. We were able to enhance PDZ1 binding drastically by substituting these residues with hydrophobic or positively charged amino acids. Finally, we demonstrate that the weak PDZ1/Cx36 interaction is sensitive to CaMKII mediated phosphorylation of Cx36, suggesting that ZO-1 unbinding may be a necessary event to potentiate electrical synapses. In summary, our study provides a detailed analysis of different mechanisms that can be exploited to modify the interaction between two key components of an electrical synapse: Cx36 and ZO-1.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

These escape funnels arise from the combined constraints of protein viability and escape from antibodies, which we model using a generative model trained on structural homologs and deep mutational scanning data. We derive a mean-field approximation of evolutionary path ensembles, enabling us to quantify both the fitness and entropy of escape routes. Applied to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, our framework reveals convergent evolution patterns, accurately predicts mutation sites in emerged variants of concern, and explains the differential effectiveness of antibody cocktails.

Using 9 transplantable human neoadjuvant-naive triple-negative breast cancer xenografts, we studied the fitness of copy number clones in spontaneous metastasis from orthotopic transplant sites. Metastatic site preference was strongly patient-dependent, and the emergence of metastases exhibited a general trend toward slower growth at the orthotopic site. In our models, single-cell whole-genome sequencing of primary and metastatic sites showed that distant metastases were most often the result of minor prevalence clones at the orthotopic site, suggesting that some metastatic phenotypes may be weakly negatively fit at the primary site. We validated the existence of a fitness hierarchy of copy number clones using a previously established paradigm of remixing and retransplanting clones. Single-cell clone analysis of competitive repopulation and re-emergence of metastases showed that CNAs arising in cancer evolution can mediate metastatic fitness. Moreover, some clones displaying strong metastatic tendency exhibited weaker survival at the primary site, consistent with the notion that metastatic phenotypes could have a fitness cost at the primary site. Finally, we conducted RNA-seq analysis combined with DriverNet analysis to dissect the contribution of CNA-mediated versus genome-independent transcriptional states. CNA mutations appeared to contribute strongly to transcriptional differences between clones. Among clones of high metastatic potential, we observed CNA-mediated and CNA-independent convergence on pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), established as mediators of metastatic cell survival at distant sites. Taken together, our data point to a contribution of CNA-mediated cancer evolution to metastatic states and identify distant-site context as a key determinant of CNA-mediated fitness.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

K.; Verzi, M.; Khurana, S.", "abstract": "Background and aims. Intestinal permeability barrier dysfunction is a defining feature of Crohns disease (CD) that precedes inflammation, persists during remission, and predicts relapse. Despite its clinical importance, no validated biomarkers or therapies directly target epithelial barrier restoration. We investigated whether hepatocyte nuclear factors HNF4-alpha and HNF4-gamma regulate tight junction (TJ) organization and barrier integrity in CD, and whether pharmacologic HNF4 activation can restore epithelial function. Methods. We integrated our previously defined HNF4-alpha, -gamma-regulated epithelial transcriptome with analyses of genetic (Hnf4-alpha, -gamma double knockout) and inflammatory (TnfdeltaARE) mouse models, human CD tissues, and patient derived organoids (PDOs). Barrier function was assessed by FITC-dextran flux and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Two plant-derived, non-toxic HNF4 agonists, N-trans-caffeoyltyramine (NCT) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (NFT), were tested for therapeutic rescue of barrier function in CD. Results. Combined loss of Hnf4-alpha, -gamma impaired epithelial barrier function by activating both pore and leak pathway, with selective permeability to 4-10 kDa tracers. Integration with our transcriptomic data from the Hnf4-alpha, -gamma double knockout (DKO) mice revealed broad repression of TJ-associated genes, including Tjp2 (encoding ZO-2), F11r (encoding JAM-A), MarvelD3, Cldn4, Cldn7, and Cldn15, together with induction of the pore-forming gene Cldn2. HNF4-alpha, -gamma proteins were markedly downregulated in CD intestinal epithelium and in PDOs established from non-inflamed mucosa, establishing that the barrier defect is epithelial-intrinsic and inflammation independent. In contrast, chronic TNF overexpression in the TnfdeltaARE mice phenocopied this suppression through a normally transient epithelial injury response that became pathologically stabilized under sustained cytokine signaling. Treatment of both CD PDOs and TnfdeltaARE mouse organoids with NCT or NFT reactivated HNF4-alpha, -gamma expression, normalized TJ gene profile, and restored TEER to near-control levels. Conclusion. HNF4-alpha, -gamma are master transcriptional regulators of epithelial TJ integrity whose loss defines a primary barrier defect in CD. Chronic inflammation can mimic but does not initiate this intrinsic defect. Pharmacologic activation of HNF4-alpha, -gamma with plant-derived, non-toxic, translationally ready agonists (NCT and NFT) restore barrier function, establishing the first barrier-healing therapy for CD.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

These organs are called nodules in the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between legume plants and rhizobial bacteria. While many studies have focused on host traits, such as plant growth, nodule count, and their structural changes, these morphological changes could also be associated with rhizobial benefits (e.g., bacterial population size). Here, we investigated how the different morphologies of alfalfa root nodules influence the fitness benefits rhizobia and hosts receive from the symbiosis. We measured how host and strain genetic variation influenced 1) nodule branch number, area, and rhizobial fitness at the individual nodule level and 2) the proportion of branched nodules, nodule number, and plant benefits at the whole plant level. From the rhizobial perspective, we found that host genetics influenced rhizobial fitness more than rhizobial genetics, and that more branched and bigger nodules tend to release more rhizobia. From the host plant perspective, we found that the proportion of branched nodules was strongly negatively correlated with the total nodule number and positively correlated with host benefit across all three alfalfa genotypes. However, the height of the relationship differed by host genotype. Together, these results provide insight into the host and rhizobial genetic contributions to nodule morphology and symbiotic outcomes, suggesting a novel direction for further research in legume-rhizobium mutualism.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Regular physical activity (PA) may reduce the reliance on visual input during walking. This study examined whether PA levels modulate age-related responses to perturbations of the optic flow that is crucial in the control of human locomotion. Methods: Sixty active and inactive younger (YA and YI: 23.3+/-3.91 y) and older adults (OA and OI: 68.3+/-3.98 y; n=15 for each group) walked on a treadmill in front of a virtual hallway. The walking protocol consisted of 3-minute walking without, and 8-minute with mediolateral optic flow perturbation. Sacrum and heel marker positions and ground reaction forces were recorded. Power spectral density (PSD) of the mediolateral sacrum position and gait parameters were analyzed. Results: The PSD increased more in OA compared to OI adults (p=0.041) while YA and YI adults did not differ. Mean (and variability of) step width and mediolateral margin of stability increased irrespective of age and PA (all p<0.001). During the 8-minute perturbation, OA adults demonstrated greater decreases in PSD than the OI adults (p=0.039). Additionally, the variability in the mediolateral margin of stability reduced more in YA and OA adults compared to YI and OI adults (p=0.048). Conclusion: Higher PA levels in OA adults were associated with stronger immediate responses in body sway to optic flow perturbations compared to older inactive and younger adults. This may support the beneficial effects of physical activity on age-related visual dependency during gait.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Correspondingly, APEX2-based electron microscopy (APEX2-EM) and immuno-EM analyses confirmed the presence of assembled virions within these unique HGS positive compartments, identifying them as sites of virion assembly. This was further supported by cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM), which captured ongoing virion formation occurring within HGS positive enlarged vesicles. Crucially, whole cell volume EM revealed that HGS deficiency abolishes these vesicular compartments and markedly reduces assembled virions.

Morphological differences between the two strains were examined by microscopy and imaging studies, and the contribution of rodA to GI colonization was assessed in a murine model through monocolonization and cocolonization experiments.

In murine cocolonization experiments, A909 WT outcompeted A909{Delta}rodA; however, monocolonization experiments exhibited comparable colonization and bacterial burden across the GI tract. In vitro experiments revealed impaired growth in bile and an increase in adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells by the {Delta}rodA mutant. rodA has a role in GBS intestinal colonization.

Genomic variation is widespread in clinical isolates and complicates identification of genetic variants underlying antifungal drug resistance and tolerance. Our understanding of genomic and phenotypic diversity during invasive infections is limited and studies of serial isolates from individual patients are uncommon. We performed comparative analyses of 101 C. albicans bloodstream isolates from 55 patients in the Minnesota Minneapolis-Saint Paul region, including serial isolates from 19 patients. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of these isolates relative to 199 globally-collected public C. albicans genomes. Results: This study's regional isolates span the phylogenetic diversity of C. albicans; 6 isolates represent novel outliers to known clades. Serial isolates from individual patients were separated by limited single nucleotide polymorphisms. Nevertheless, we identified extensive large-scale genomic variation between serial isolates including polyploidy, aneuploidy, copy number variation, loss of heterozygosity, and chromosomal rearrangements. We demonstrated how a heterozygous ERG251 loss of function variant drives azole tolerance in a clinical isolate from a patient with a history of recurrent infections. Using serial isolates, we demonstrated that polyploidy provides an adaptive advantage in the presence of fluconazole despite the absence of overt antifungal drug resistance. Conclusions: Our analysis of serial isolates reveals the genomic plasticity of C. albicans during invasive infections and identifies variation driving antifungal drug tolerance.

The AMD associated interval has been refined to a 5,196 bp segment flanking the ARMS2/HTRA1 region, excluding HTRA1 and the ARMS2 indel (443del54ins) variant by risk haplotype analysis. Although the missense SNP rs10490924 has been proposed as a functional variant, its role in AMD remains controversial, and the causative variants and underlying mechanisms within this region remain unresolved. Methods An unbiased bioinformatic screen identified a 5 SNP block within the 5,196 bp interval that potentially alters cABL protein binding. Protein DNA interactions were validated using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Genetic association with AMD (dry and wet subtypes) was assessed in patient cohorts using blood genomic DNA. The regulatory effect of the 5 SNP block was further examined using luciferase reporter assays. Findings We identified a 5 SNP streak located ~556 bp upstream of the ARMS2 start codon, representing a cluster of predicted cABL tyrosine kinase binding sites. This block, in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs10490924 (A69S), showed a strong association with both wet and dry AMD (136 controls, 179 dry AMD, 251 wet AMD). EMSA and ChIP confirmed direct cABL binding, while luciferase reporter assays demonstrated reduced transcriptional activity mediated by the 5 SNP block in the presence of cABL.

We report that ex vivo culture of CBU HSCs with mitofusin agonists (MAs) enhances long-term repopulating activity by over five fold in both primary and secondary transplantation assays without changes of total nucleated cells or phenotypic HSCs. Mechanistically, MA-treated HSCs show suppressed protein synthesis, increased autophagic flux, and elevated lysosomal acidification. Transcriptomic analysis implicates downregulation of MTOR signaling, and immunoprecipitation studies confirm a direct interaction between MFN2 and MTOR. These data support a model in which fusion-competent MFN2 sequesters MTOR, promoting a catabolic state that preserves HSC potency. Our findings suggest a novel MFN2/MTOR regulatory axis that enhances the functional expansion of human HSCs for potential therapeutic application.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

L.; Lovell, S. C.", "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented scientific response. The enormous scale of global genome sequencing, protein structural determination and targeted studies of protein and variant dynamics has resulted in a unique dataset which provides a valuable resource for understanding of viral evolutionary dynamics. Previous analysis of SARS-CoV-2 evolution has revealed apparently saltatory dynamics, with viral variants arising following large evolutionary jumps without genetic intermediates represented in the sequence database. We utilise rich SARS-CoV-2 datasets to interrogate the role of protein structural constraint in SARS-CoV-2 evolution and whether these evolutionary jumps may result from the viral spike protein accessing new regions of viable sequence space. We apply multiple computational predictors of structural constraint across different structural backgrounds and assess how constraint has changed during SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution. These predictions are validated using substitution data from the SARS-CoV-2 global sequence database. We find that all predictive methods suggest that the structural constraint experienced by specific sites has undergone very limited change, despite significant phenotypic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Signature mutations for variants of concern are not found to be under structural constraint by any computational predictor regardless of which viral variant structure is used to calculate predictions. We also develop a machine learning model to assess substitution viability, combining predictors of evolutionary constraint with information about local structural context. This confirms our conclusions, with model performance largely unaffected by the use of different viral variant structures. We also find no reduction in the shared proportion of accessible substitutions over evolutionary time, as would be expected if the S protein had entered and explored novel sequence space during variant evolution. These results suggest that despite its rapid rate of mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is subject to strict structural constraints and shows that viral genomes exhibit limited plasticity following infection of a new host.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

However, crossover between homoeologues is normally suppressed by two major genes, ZIP4-5B (Ph1) and MSH7-3D (Ph2). We investigated the effect of introducing zip4-5B and/or msh7-3D mutations into interspecific hybrids derived from crosses between wheat and Aegilops variabilis. Single and double mutants were exploited in Chinese Spring (CS) and Cadenza (Cad) genetic backgrounds, as well as in a CS/Cad recombinant background. The number of univalents, bivalents and multivalents was scored from meiotic cells at metaphase I, from which numbers of chiasmata were deduced. We demonstrated a non-cumulative effect of simultaneous zip4-5B and msh7-3D mutations on homoeologous recombination, as homoeologous crossovers reached a maximum when ZIP4-5B alone was mutated. We also showed that hybrids carrying both the zip4-5B and msh7-3D mutations in the same genetic background exhibited more effective recombination compared to a double mutant in the CS/Cad recombinant background. The progression of meiosis was also monitored in the different interspecific hybrids mutants, revealing clear disruptions. Thus, our study significantly contributes to the optimization of the introgression of beneficial alleles from wild relatives into elite wheat germplasm; first by demonstrating the efficiency of ZIP4-5B and MSH7-3D mutations independently and in combination and second by elucidating the influence of the genetic background in which these mutations are present in an interspecific hybrid context.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Haploinsufficiency of the epigenetic regulator POGZ represents one of the strongest such associations; however, little is known about the direct or indirect regulatory targets of POGZ, or the mechanisms by which loss of this chromatin modifier alters early neuronal development and synaptic functions. Here, we created an allelic series of CRISPR-engineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) clones harboring mono- and bi-allelic POGZ deletions. In hiPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSC) and Neurogenin 2-induced neurons (iN), POGZ LoF altered the expression of genes associated with critical cellular processes and neuronal functions, including synaptic and intracellular signaling and extracellular matrix organization. Our multiomics profiling also showed altered footprinting of critical transcription factors (e.g., activator protein 1 complexes) that were enriched at promoters of differentially expressed genes associated with synaptic function. To further interrogate the shared molecular changes in neuronal development associated with NDD and POGZ regulation, we compared our results to deletions of the transcription factor MEF2C and the sodium channel gene SCN2A that we generated in these same isogenic iN. These analyses revealed strong enrichment of extracellular matrix and intracellular signaling disruption associated with POGZ and MEF2C deletion, whereas POGZ and SCN2A haploinsufficiency exhibited shared transcriptional effects on gene modules enriched for NDD-associated genes with opposing regulatory effects. Notably, we also observed alterations to synaptic firing rate and neurite extension with bi-allelic deletions, but not heterozygous lines, suggesting subtle effects in neuronal development associated with haploinsufficiency. Overall, these shared molecular consequences suggest key points of convergence that connect epigenetic regulation to neuronal function in the etiology of neurodevelopmental pathologies.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

P.; Hossen, K.; Khandaker, M. S.; Majid, S.; Islam, M. M.; Arefin, S.; Chondrow Dev, P.; Sarker, S.; Hossain, T.", "abstract": "Introduction: Transcriptomic biomarker discovery has been a challenge due to variation in datasets and platforms, complexity in statistical and computational methods, integration of multiple programming languages, and intricacy of ML workflow to evaluate biomarkers. Standard workflows necessitate several stages (quality control, normalization, differential expression), typically executed in R or Python, resulting in bottlenecks for non-experts. Existing platforms have alleviated certain challenges by offering graphical interfaces for data loading, normalization, differential gene expression analysis, and functional analysis; nevertheless, they typically do not incorporate integrated machine learning procedures for biomarker selection. Method: In this regard, we present omicML, an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that combines transcriptomic data analysis with machine learning (ML)-based classification via integrating R and Python packages/libraries. It supports both RNA-Seq and microarray data, automating preprocessing (data import, quality control, and normalization) and differential expression analysis. The tool annotates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with descriptions, gene ontology, and pathway information and incorporates comparative analysis. Our extensive ML pipeline enables both supervised and unsupervised learning, integrates various datasets based on candidate gene signatures, standardizes and eliminates less significant features, benchmarks multiple ML classifiers with robust performance metrics (e.g., AUROC, AUPRC), assesses feature importance, develops single-gene and multi-gene predictive models, and systematically finalizes the biomarker algorithm. All functionalities are available in omicML, hence reducing the barrier for biologists without computational proficiency. Result: In a case study, omicML identified a six-gene diagnostic model that distinguishes Mpox (monkeypox virus) infections from those caused by other viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola, and varicella-zoster. These results illustrate omicML's capacity to discern clinically relevant biomarkers from complex transcriptome data. Conclusion: Through the unified system, omicML (https://omicml.org), integrating data preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis, annotation, heatmap analysis, dataset integration, batch effect correction, machine learning approach, and functional analysis can diminish technical barriers and accelerates the conversion of expression data into diagnostic insights for clinicians and bench scientists.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Traditional structure alignment tools based on three-dimensional protein structures, such as TM-Align, DALI, or ProBiS, are accurate, but they are computationally expensive and impractical at scale. Existing protein language models (PLMs), such as TM-Vec, improve computational efficiency but only capture global structural similarity, overlooking important motif-level structural details. In this paper, we propose a novel PLM consisting of a Siamese neural network, enabling efficient embedding-based structural comparison while also capturing both global and local structural similarity. Our model was trained on a dual loss function combining TM-score, a global similarity metric, and a variation of lDDT scores, a per-residue similarity metric. We tested against two datasets: a varied TM-score dataset from TM-Vec, and a high TM-score mutant dataset from VIPUR. Against these sets, our model achieved a TM-score MAE of 0.0741 and 0.0583, respectively, and a lDDT-score MAE of 0.0788 and 0.0038, respectively. Our model fulfills two key roles: first, it rapidly detects global structural differences.

The obstructive phenotype bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is characterized by the abnormal activation of epithelium in airways accompanied by fibrotic changes with excessive deposition of extracellular matrix, resulting in narrowing and ultimately obliteration of airways. Mast cells, characterized by mediators such as tryptase and chymase, play a role in lung fibrosis. The proteins, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and SERPIN family member A 3 (SERPINA3) have previously been associated with progression of lung fibrosis. Tryptase-mast cells can produce OPG, while chymase released from mast cells interacts with SERPINA3. This study aimed to investigate if and how SERPINA3, OPG and tryptase/chymase-positive mast cells are related to fibrotic airway obliteration, and potentially show an association with BOS severity. Methods: SERPINA3 levels in serum from patients with or without BOS were examined using ELISA. In lung tissue from patients with BOS, we identified non-cartilaginous airways and classified them into normal, partially and completely obstructed airways. Immunohistochemistry was used for detection of SERPINA3, OPG, chymase and tryptase. Colocalization of, and interactions between, SERPINA3, OPG and tryptase were assessed by immunofluorescence, proximity ligation assay, and AlphaFold modeling. Results: SERPINA3 levels in serum from BOS patients were higher compared to non-BOS patients. A low percentage of SERPINA3 and OPG was detected in partially and completely obstructed airways. Cells positive for OPG and SERPINA3 colocalized with tryptase-mast cells in airways from BOS lung tissue. OPG colocalized with SERPINA3 and their staining positively correlated in partially obstructed airways. In completely obstructed airways, OPG, SERPINA3 and tryptase staining areas all positively correlated with each other. Conclusion: SERPINA3 and OPG are expressed by mast cells and these proteins may form a complex in lung tissue with potential for contributing to airway remodeling in BOS.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

At thermoneutrality, PNPLA3 is easily detected in liver and increases with feeding; the protein is undetectable in adipose tissue, despite significantly higher Pnpla3 mRNA levels. Cold exposure or beta 3-adrenergic stimulation did not alter hepatic PNPLA3 but triggered a >19-fold increase in adipose PNPLA3, accompanied by a >75% reduction in Pnpla3 mRNA. This effect occurred in cultured adipocytes and was blocked by inhibiting Protein Kinase A or AKT. The predominant cause of the kinase-dependent increase in adipocyte PNPLA3 was reduced degradation.

Filling of vessels with air, or embolism, disturbs this transport process and, in extreme cases, leads to tree mortality. The current network models of embolism spreading from embolised vessels to their sap-filled neighbours use an excessive number of parameters related to xylem physiology and anatomy. Further, most of these models interpret the intervessel pit membrane as a 2D surface. Here, we first extend the existing physiological network models of embolism spreading by implementing a 3D pit membrane model. Then, we introduce a susceptible-infected (SI) spreading model for embolism propagation. After correct fitting of the spreading probability, our SI model produces vulnerability curves matching those produced by the physiological model or extracted from empirical data. This demonstrates that the SI model can address embolism spreading dynamics also in plant species, for which detailed physiological data are not available. The combination of the SI model and intervessel network structure allows interpreting embolism spreading as an instance of directed percolation, suggesting that xylem hydraulics fail merely due to break-down of the intervessel network than loss of sap in plant tissue.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which SHIP1 mediates its role in suppressing inflammatory pathways, with a focus on human microglia. Our findings illuminate an essential role for SHIP1 in endosome maturation and lysosomal function. We show that SHIP1 localizes to both the plasma membrane and to endo-lysosomal compartments and binds to the CapZ family of proteins, which are important for endosome maturation. Reduction of SHIP1 levels via genome editing impairs endosome maturation and lysosomal function, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and leakage of lysosomal cathepsin B into the cytosol, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. CITE-seq profiling of SHIP1-deficient microglia revealed a shift from an immune-responsive state toward a DAM-like, phagocytic state, accompanied by impaired response to LPS and enhanced phagocytosis of synaptic material and apoptotic neurons via TREM2. While amyloid {beta} uptake was not affected, amyloid {beta} accumulated intracellularly due to defective lysosomal degradation, further driving lipid droplet formation. Together, these results identify SHIP1 as a regulator of endo-lysosomal function and selective phagocytosis of lipid-rich substrates in microglia. These findings have important implications for therapeutic hypotheses that target SHIP1 for treatment of AD, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular mechanisms that set the 24-hour period remain poorly defined. Here, using single-molecule imaging and nascent RNA sequencing, we uncover an unexpected RNA-based molecular timer: a single intron in the Drosophila timeless (tim) gene that regulates circadian period length by controlling mRNA localization. Strikingly, we find that ~50% of tim mRNAs are localized to the nucleus due to inefficient post-transcriptional splicing of a single intron (which we named intron P), in contrast to other core clock transcripts that localize predominantly to the cytoplasm. CRISPR-mediated removal of intron P abolishes nuclear retention of tim transcripts, leading to accelerated TIM protein accumulation and a shortened ~22-hour period with reduced rhythmic robustness. Remarkably, insertion of intron P alone into heterologous reporters is sufficient to promote nuclear retention in both Drosophila and human cells, acting as a conserved checkpoint that withholds transcripts in the nucleus until splicing is complete. Finally, we identify three RNA-binding proteins, two repressors (Hrb27C and Squid) and one activator (Qkr58E-2, a Sam68 homolog), that modulate intron P splicing in a rheostat-like manner. Together, these findings establish tim intron P as the first intron-based molecular timer in circadian clocks and reveal splicing kinetics as a critical regulatory layer in temporal gene expression programs, with broad implications for other processes such as development and immunity.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}

Here we define a conserved glutamine-rich region that mediates SALL1/4 homo- and heterotetramerisation and find that complex formation is indispensable for DNA binding. Modelling a patient mutation that abolishes SALL4 multimerisation led to gene misregulation and, in mice, embryonic lethality, therefore phenocopying a complete Sall4 knockout. Furthermore, a common disease-causing SALL1 truncation, which retains multimerisation but lacks DNA-binding domains, sequesters SALL4 into heterotetramers that are defective in DNA binding, thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for the dominant-negative effects of many Townes-Brocks mutations.

Chief among these was WBP2 (WW domain binding protein 2), an oncogenic transcriptional co-activator. Utilizing immunofluorescence, it was confirmed that endogenous WWP1 co-localizes with WBP2 in human heart tissue, and, using the Y2H system, we showed that this interaction is dependent upon the associations between WW domains 1 and 3 from WWP1 and PY domains 2 and 3 of WBP2.

Reduced expression of Fragile X protein (FXP) family members (FMR1, FXR1 and FXR2) in vulnerable neurons is associated with neurodegeneration, and loss of each individual FXP induces overlapping and unique aging-related phenotypes in HAP1 and SH-SY5Y cell models. Therefore, we analyzed consequences of FXP loss on TDP-43 cytoplasmic mislocalization and stress granule formation in fibroblast-like HAP1 FXP knockout cells. FXP loss induced nuclear pore pathology, and passive egress of proteins and RNA was evident upon loss of FXR1 or FXR2. Cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43 was restricted to FXR1 knockout cells upon impairment of nuclear import, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 induced spontaneous stress granules exclusively in FXR2 knockout cells.

Marmosets furthermore show significantly reduced interest in synthesized pitch contours compared to natural phee calls and did not differentiate between pitch contour playbacks and pure tone control stimuli, indicating that they did not categorize the pitch contours as conspecific calls.

Recently, the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the adrenal capsule and cortex was explored by dividing them into two fractions: outer (OF) and inner (IF). A significant variation in the levels of ECM proteins, including collagens, was documented. During the biosynthesis of collagen, it undergoes a plethora of PTMs exhibiting crucial roles such as cell-matrix interaction, adhesion, crosslinking, stability, etc. However, the site-specific identification and characterization of collagen PTMs remained challenging and is unknown for the human adrenal gland. We applied our in-house developed proteomics pipeline to identify several PTMS in 25 collagen chains from human adrenal-ECM. In the entire collagenome, we identified a total of 963 4-hydroxyproline (4-HyP), 201 3-hydroxyproline (3-HyP), 105 hydroxylysine (HyK), 17 galactosyl-hydroxylysine (G-HyK), and 35 glucosyl galactosyl-hydroxylysine (GG-HyK) sites. Although the site-specificity of collagen PTMs (3-HyP, HyK, G/GG-HyK) across fractions is conserved, the occupancies were different in a site-specific manner. Classically, a fully 3-hydroxylated site (P1164) of COL1A1 associated with osteogenesis imperfecta was found to be approximately fully hydroxylated (~99%) across fractions. Similarly, we also looked at the microheterogeneity of lysine modifications on one lysine residue (K862) of COL1A1. We observed that the hydroxylation level was higher in OF, while glycosylation levels were higher in IF. This may suggest a change in the crosslinking of collagen I across both fractions. Further, our analysis revealed much higher site-specific O-glycosylation in basement membrane collagen-IV, potentially facilitating the secretion of steroids from the adrenal gland. For the first time, we have annotated the collagen PTMs, developed a COL1A1 PTM map, and quantitated site-specific PTMs in the human adrenal gland.

M.; Kirchhoff, F.", "abstract": "Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) have crossed from apes to humans at least four times, but only one event gave rise to the AIDS pandemic. The host barriers that pandemic HIV-1 group M (major) strains overcame to spread efficiently in humans remain poorly understood. To identify such barriers, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 screens driven by the replication efficiency of SIVcpz, the chimpanzee precursor of HIV-1. Guide RNA libraries targeting more than 500 human genes encoding potential antiviral factors were inserted into the replication-competent SIVcpz MB897 molecular clone, which is phylogenetically closely related to HIV-1 group M strains. Propagation in Cas9-expressing human SupT1 T cells significantly enriched for sgRNAs targeting ADAR, AXIN1, CEACAM3, CD72, EHMT2, GRN, HMOX1, HMGA1, ICAM2, CD72, IFITM2, MEFV, PCED1B, SGOL2, SMARCA4, SUMO1 and TMEM173. These hits only partially overlapped with those identified in analogous HIV-1 based screens, indicating virus-specific restriction profiles. Functional analyses confirmed that IFITM2 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2), PCED1B (PC-esterase domain-containing protein 1B), MEFV (Mediterranean fever protein, pyrin/TRIM20), and AXIN1 (Axis inhibition protein 1), restrict replication of SIVcpz but not of HIV-1 group M strains in primary human CD4 T cells. These findings reveal previously unrecognized host factors that limit SIVcpz replication in human cells and highlight barriers that HIV-1 likely overcame during its adaptation for pandemic spread.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Targeting C2 reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury-induced complement activation in preclinical human models", "doi": "10.1101/2025.10.27.684821", "authors": "de Zeeuw, E.; Tool, L.; Krijgsman, D.; Haspeslagh, E.; Van de Walle, I.; Delaere, J.; Hack, E.; Leusen, J.; Budding, K.; Gijzen, L.", "abstract": "Kidney transplantation (KTx) is a main treatment option of end stage renal disease. KTx outcome is hampered by various factors including ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI). Animal models suggest a role for natural IgM recognizing neoepitopes exposed on ischemic cells as a main trigger for IRI-induced complement activation. However, it is unclear if experimental data from these animal models can be extrapolated to human IRI. We used in vitro human models for kidney IRI to evaluate complement activation. First, we compared IgM binding and complement fixation on different endothelial cell (EC) sources in a 2D culture model, using primary kidney-derived ECs, primary lung-derived ECs and human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). These cells were exposed to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation in presence of complement-active human serum, or serum subjected to targeted complement inhibition. Next, we validated our findings in a 3D microfluidic organ-on-a-chip model for human kidney IRI using both HUVECs and renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs). In the 2D IRI model, we observed increased binding of IgM and C3 fixation on different EC sources after ischemia and subsequent reoxygenation in presence of human serum. This was not detected when cells were exposed to normoxic culture conditions. These results were confirmed in the 3D culture model, where hypoxia followed by reperfusion with complement-active human serum also led to IgM binding and C3 fixation, particularly to HUVECs. Expression of ICAM-1, a key adhesion molecule linked to renal IRI pathophysiology, was increased on RPTECs after IR-induced complement activation on HUVECs. In both models, complement inhibition at the level of C2 inhibited the abovementioned effects of IR-induced complement activation. These results suggest classical and lectin complement pathway involvement in IR-induced damage and identify C2 as a target for therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-10-27", "journal": ""}
