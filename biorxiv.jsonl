Here we discovered - within the promoter of the transcription factor gene Nodule Inception (NIN) - a cis-regulatory element (PACE), exclusively present in members of this clade. PACE was essential for restoring infection threads (ITs) in nin mutants of the legume Lotus japonicus. PACE sequence variants from RNS-competent species appeared functionally equivalent. Evolutionary loss or mutation of PACE is associated with loss of this symbiosis. During early stages of nodule development, PACE dictates gene expression in a spatially restricted domain containing cortical cells carrying ITs. Consistent with its expression domain, PACE-driven NIN expression restored the formation of cortical ITs, also when engineered into the NIN promoter of tomato. Our data pinpoint PACE as a key evolutionary invention that connected NIN to a pre-existing symbiosis signal transduction cascade that governs the intracellular accommodation of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi and is conserved throughout land plants. This connection enabled bacterial uptake into plant cells via intracellular support structures like ITs, a unique and unifying feature of this symbiosis.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify an unrecognized synergy between oxidative and non-oxidative neutrophil defenses. We show that myeloperoxidase-derived hypohalous acids selectively halogenate alpha-defensins (HNP1-3) at conserved tyrosine residues. This post-translational modification occurs in both human and rat neutrophils and is prominent in diseases marked by neutrophil-rich inflammation, including cystic fibrosis, bacterial pneumonia, and Staphylococcus aureus abscesses. Halogenation increases HNP1 hydrophobicity without altering its structure, reprogramming these peptides into potent immunomodulatory mediators. Using single-cell transcriptomics and a in vivo peritonitis model, we demonstrate that halogenated HNP1s amplify immune signaling. Our analysis of the human haloproteome reveals a novel oxidative mechanism by which hypohalous acids rewire immune protein functions, uncovering an unexpected layer of cooperation between neutrophil effector systems. The discovery of halogenated HNP1s represents, to our knowledge, the first characterization of a protein halogenation that has biologically significance in human immunity.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is required to treat such a condition but it is associated with a small increase in birth defects in comparison to pregnancies not involving assisted conception. Consequently, new targeted treatments are needed to restore fertility. Here, a combination of in vivo injection and electroporation of capped and poly-A-tailed naked mRNA is tested as a strategy to treat ARMC2-related infertility in mouse. mRNAs coding for several reporter genes are tested and the efficiency and the kinetic of expression are assessed using in vivo and in vitro 2D and 3D imaging experiments. We show that mRNA-coded reporter proteins are detected for up to 3 weeks in germ cells, making the use of mRNA possible to treat infertility. We compare these results with those obtained with a non-integrative plasmid Enhanced Episomal Vector (EEV), which induces low and transient expression in spermatogenic cells. Consequently, injection and electroporation of naked mRNA-Armc2 into the testes of Armc2-deficient males were performed and we show the presence of normal and motile sperm in the epididymis. These motile sperm were able to produce embryos by IVF and ICSI. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that mRNA electroporation can restore sperm motility and partially fertilizing ability, providing a proof-of-concept for mRNA-based strategies to correct monogenic causes of male infertility and opening new avenues for male infertility treatment.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Biopsies from tumor-free nephrectomy tissues were used to create mimicked BTM, allowing optimization of RNA extraction procedure. RNA yield and integrity were then systematically evaluated prior to downstream analyses. Subsequently, gene expression analysis was performed through multiple techniques: qPCR, RNA sequencing, and NanoString nCounter system. The results showed that storage time (the duration a biopsy is stored in BTM), ranging from 0.5 to 24 hours, did not significantly affect RNA quality and yield. The transcriptomic signals detected in biopsy tissues are largely recapitulated in the corresponding BTM samples. The differential gene expression analysis based on BTM identified rejection-associated profiles, which are aligned with Banff lesion scores.

We conducted a comprehensive study integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, and cell biology approaches to investigate the role of PLD3 in lysosome function in neurons. PLD3 undergoes aberrant ubiquitination in AD brain tissue, leading to altered protein abundance and subcellular location. We assessed the lysosomal proteome in SH-SY5Y cells with PLD3 knockout and found PLD3-/- cells had higher levels of proteins related to lysosomal biogenesis, endocytosis, and calcium signaling. Loss of PLD3 caused an enlargement in neuronal lysosome size, increased endocytic activity and a decline in lysosomal clearance of aggregated human beta-amyloid or alpha-synuclein, despite increased expression level and activity of cathepsin B. PLD3-deficiency increase the level and transcriptional activity of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3 (TFE3), suggesting a role for PLD3 in regulating lysosomal biogenesis.

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central paradigms of medical entomology. Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence challenging this assumption. We show that when reared under dehydration/starvation conditions, male mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder while CRISPR mutants with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates. For multiple mosquito species, dehydrated males are attracted to human hosts and attempt to probe. We also observed several instances where dehydrated probing males were able to successfully pierce vertebrate host skin and acquire blood from a vertebrate host. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes became infected with and orally transmitted the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. Finally, we collected wild, putatively blood-fed male mosquitoes from Texas, USA and Mallorca, Spain, and identified vertebrate DNA in these samples (canine and human, respectively). These data suggest that under specific circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts. These results are a paradigm shift in our understanding of male mosquito biology and suggest they may be more directly involved in pathogen transmission cycles than previously recognized.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

For large, free-ranging organisms, however, encounter rates are rarely quantified directly (e.g., via telemetry), due to both logistical and methodological challenges and are instead approximated through proxies such as spatial or temporal overlap. However, such proxies lack of precision regarding encounter rates estimation due to the exclusion of one of the dimensions (spatial or temporal). Camera traps, while not suited to directly measure encounters of large free-roaming species, can help overcome these limitations by estimating to what extent species tolerate or avoid one another proximity. We analysed data from a one-year study across four German protected areas using 283 camera traps and applying recurrent event analysis to investigate interactions among three prey species (red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus, wild boar Sus scrofa) and two predators (grey wolf Canis lupus, Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx). Prey visitation rates were unaffected by predator presence, but wolves exhibited a strong attraction to prey, with visitation rates approximatively seven times higher right after prey detection. Limited data prevented robust conclusion regarding the Eurasian lynx. These findings point towards an asymmetry in predation sequence (i.e., spatio-temporal proximity, encounter, ignorance or avoidance post-encounter, capture or escape from attack): predators must succeed at every stage of the sequence to capture prey, while prey can fail at some steps (e.g. by decreasing spatio-temporal proximity, as in this study) but eventually escape predation by disrupting the process at any other stage.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

RIF1 is highly expressed in human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and tissues and upregulated during tumour progression. Depletion of RIF1 in squamous cell carcinoma cells exacerbates their endogenous replication stress. Mechanistically, we show that YAP interacts with RIF1 specifically at broken replication forks, and that YAP depletion impairs DNA damage repair under replication stress.

Therapeutic thymus regeneration via androgen ablation repopulates naive CD8 T cells in lymph nodes and reinvigorates tumor recognition in middle-aged male mice.

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes.

We first validated these sensors to be superior to previous versions. Next, we developed a new Python-based analysis program, CaFire, which enables the automated quantification of evoked and spontaneous calcium signals. Using CaFire, we show a ratiometric presynaptic GCaMP8m sensor accurately captures physiologically-relevant presynaptic calcium changes with superior sensitivity and similar kinetics compared to chemical dyes. Moreover, we test the ability of an active zone-targeted, ratiometric GCaMP8f sensor to report differences in calcium between release sites.

We developed three robot-based tasks using the vBOT planar manipulandum to evaluate sensorimotor performance in healthy young (<35 years) and older (>60 years) adults. These tasks uniquely combined bimanual control and altered dynamic conditions to assess age-related differences. The first task required bimanual coordination to control a virtual 2D arm over 400 center-out and return trials, targeting de novo motor learning. The second task involved unimanual reaching with the dominant hand, consisting of 200 trials in a null-field condition followed by 200 trials with object-like dynamic forces. The third task similarly began with 200 null-field trials and then introduced a viscous force field in the final 200 trials, with fast movements rewarded to encourage peak performance. This task also enabled comparison between dominant and non-dominant arms. All tasks detected age-related performance differences, with the viscous resistance task proving most sensitive to declines in movement speed, force generation, and response onset time. Scoring mechanisms that encouraged brisk performance amplified these effects. Across tasks, older adults generally moved more slowly, took longer to complete tasks, exerted lower peak forces, and had longer response onset times. However, some older participants performed comparably to younger individuals. In the third task, dominant arm performance consistently exceeded that of the non-dominant arm.

To address this question, we designed a recurrent neural network model in which a set of weight matrices (i.e. pathways) can be combined to generate every network structure between feedforward and fully recurrent. We term these architectures partially recurrent neural networks (pRNNs). We trained over 25,000 pRNNs on a novel set of reinforcement learning tasks, designed to mimic multisensory navigation, and compared their performance across multiple functional metrics. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, many architectures match or exceed the performance of fully recurrent networks, despite using as few as one-quarter the number of parameters; demonstrating that partial recurrence enables energy efficient, yet performant solutions. Second, each pathway's functional impact is both task and circuit dependent. For instance, feedback connections enhance robustness to noise in some, but not all contexts. Third, different pRNN architectures learn solutions with distinct input sensitivities and memory dynamics, and these computational traits help to explain their functional capabilities.

Ultrastructural quantitative analysis of electron microscopy images suggested that cells in EmC acquire nuclear and mitochondrial features that resemble those of tumor tissue. Proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and metabolic flux analyses showed that cells in EmC and SphC favor mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, respectively. EmC rendered cells hypersensitive to OXPHOS inhibition, but more resistant to oxidative stress. Several genes associated with lung metastasis, including ID1, were specifically enriched in EmC.

Apical-basal polarity is established by cortical polarity proteins that define the apical, junctional, and basolateral domains. While cortical polarity proteins are highly conserved and present in most epithelia, the mechanisms that establish polarity and the requirements for canonical polarity factors can vary between tissues and organisms. For example, the basolateral polarity protein lethal giant larvae (Lgl) is essential for the polarization of most Drosophila epithelia, yet is dispensable for epithelial polarization and viability in C. elegans. To better understand the epithelial polarity program in C. elegans, we performed a whole-genome RNAi screen for synthetic lethality with an lgl-1 deletion mutant. We found that combined loss of LGL-1 and the RhoGAP protein PAC-1 (RhoGAP19D in flies) leads to embryonic lethality due to defects in elongation and rupturing of the epidermis. We observed mislocalization of junctional proteins to the lateral domain of epidermal cells, presumably weakening tissue integrity. Furthermore, we observed expansion of the apical domain, aPKC mislocalization, and localization of the basolateral polarity protein LET-413Scribble in patches surrounded by DLG-1Discs large. These observations indicate that the combined loss of LGL-1 and PAC-1 leads to an overactivity of apical domain specifying factors. Consistent with this, partial inactivation of the apical polarity regulators aPKC or CDC-42 reduced the lethality of pac-1(RNAi); lgl-1(null) animals. Taken together, our findings identify pac-1 and lgl-1 as redundant inhibitors of apical polarity factors.

Guided by the stickers-and-spacers framework, we hypothesized that clusters of charged residues within IDRs function in promoting intracellular condensation process. Using a sliding-window approach, we designated and dissected the polyelectrolyte (PE) domains of Nst1 and Edc3 and established their essential contributions to condensate coalescence. In Nst1, the polyanionic (PA) subdomain enhances intermolecular attraction and promotes coalescence, whereas the polyampholyte (PAM) subdomain imparts rigidity to the condensate as a distinct modulatory element and functions as a platform in condensation process of other P-body components. PA of Edc3 also regulates coalescence. Extending these findings to the neurodegenerative disease-associated protein TDP-43, we show that its PA regions are critical for coalescence, consistent with the presence of negatively charged amino acid clusters as potent molecular stickers functioning in condensate coalescence in cells.

Much work has focused on how the nucleotide state of {beta}-tubulin regulates the structure and dynamics of microtubules. In contrast, less is known about the structure and function of the C-terminal tails (CTTs) of - and {beta}-tubulin which are thought to freely protrude from the surface of the microtubule. To study the CTT of -tubulin, we developed three different biosensors that bind the tyrosinated -tubulin CTT (Y-CTT). Surprisingly, live imaging of the probes indicates that the Y-CTT is minimally accessible along the microtubule lattice under normal cellular conditions. Lattice binding of the Y-CTT probes can be increased by three different ways of changing the tubulin conformational state: the drug Taxol, expression of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that recognize or promote an expanded tubulin conformation, or expression of tubulin that cannot hydrolyze GTP. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Y-CTT undergoes numerous transient interactions with the bodies of -tubulin and {beta}-tubulin in the lattice, and that the frequency of these interactions is regulated by the tubulin nucleotide state. These findings suggest that accessibility of the Y-CTT is locally governed by nucleotide- and MAP-dependent conformational changes to tubulin subunits within the microtubule lattice.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Theories of sustained attention often point to failures of cognitive control in maintaining the task-set, while data-driven approaches suggest that lapses may instead reflect a breakdown in the selection of task-relevant information. This study aimed to characterize the neural mechanisms of sustained attention lapses and to test whether EEG-based signatures of lapse-prone states are distinct from signatures of failures of selective attention and task-set maintenance. Twenty adults completed a sustained attention go/no-go task while focusing on either numbers or letters, with EEG recorded simultaneously. Poor sustained attention was examined at two complementary levels: trial-level lapses, defined as no-go errors, and attentional states, derived from reaction-time variability and categorized as in-the-zone versus out-of-the-zone. Across both levels, suboptimal sustained attention was associated with attenuated event-related potentials, most notably a reduced parietal P3 amplitude and weaker whole-scalp inter-electrode correlation. To isolate a unique EEG marker of lapse-prone state, a machine-learning classifier decoded attentional state from EEG activity. Cross-validated accuracy reached ~80% and remained robust after controlling for reaction time. Finally, representational similarity analysis confirmed that this neural signature was dissociable from stimulus-side selection and task-set maintenance.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

However, few studies explore how task could, in turn, influence resting state connectivity. This work attempts to understand this through the lens of immoral decisions. Using resting-state and task-state fMRI data collected before, during, and after an information-passing task involving dishonest choices with rewards, we employed the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the changes in the brain dynamics state. First, the HMM results identified 4 intrinsic brain states across both resting scans and task scans, including one reward network (state 1) and one control network (state 3). The reward network are associated with high dishonesty, while the control network are associated with low dishonesty. Importantly, task engagement in immoral behavior altered the post-task brain state. As participants engaged in persistent dishonesty, the network reconfigures itself to priorities the reward network and suppress the control network. Such suppression persists beyond the immediate task timeframe and leaves lingering signatures in the post-task resting scan. Contrary to the view of resting-state as a static baseline, our analysis showed the \"non-resting\" nature of post-task resting scans, where dishonesty could have an \"after-effect\" on neural dynamics. Together, these findings suggest that the 'post-moral decision brain' operates not as a static system but as a set of dynamically shifting states, whose adaptive trajectories may underlie the lasting effect of decision behavior in the prior task.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We discover significant lineage-specific chromatin remodeling predominantly in newly formed and immature excitatory neurons, highlighting a robust EPO-driven neurogenic response as the first direct evidence that an extrinsic factor can induce adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

It is also expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) while its participation in the process of lymphangiogenesis remains inadequately characterized. We show in this study that VEGFR2 is highly expressed in dermal initial lymphatic vessels and valves. The induced deletion of pan-endothelial Vegfr2 at the neonatal stage produced a potent suppression of dermal lymphatic growth, including the thinner lymphatic diameter, the decrease of LEC number and lymphatic valves. Mechanistically, the VEGFR2 insufficiency led to a dramatic decrease of lymphatic VEGFR3, a key regulator mediating signals for lymphatic growth and remodeling. The RNA sequencing analysis revealed that GO terms enriched for the downregulated genes included biological processes related to the EC development while pathways related to the hematopoiesis and immune responses were upregulated in the skin of Vegfr2 mutants compared with the littermate controls. This was further confirmed by the RNA-seq analysis of dermal tissues 48 hours after the endothelial Vegfr2 deletion. Consistently, an inhibitory effect on the dermal lymphatic growth was also observed by targeting Vegfr2 in PROX1+ cells, manifesting a similarly altered transcriptome signature. The alteration of lymphatic gene expression was further validated by the siRNA mediated knockdown of Vegfr2 in primary lymphatic endothelial cells, showing a transcriptional trend of LEC to hematopoietic transition. Findings from this study imply that VEGFR2 is required for the maintenance of endothelial identity and its insufficiency may trigger the alteration of lymphatic transcriptional programs to diminish the VEGFR3-mediated lymphangiogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We take a multimodal approach to brain segmentation by examining the influence of the structural connectivity values inferred from diffusion MRI (dMRI) in addition to using values from structural MRI (sMRI). Our results demonstrate the utility of GNN models, particularly the GAT architecture, which achieved Dice scores competitive to those reported in the literature with non-graph methods. Additionally, structural connectivity derived from dMRI revealed significant value in improving automatic segmentation, as models trained on combined attributes from dMRI and sMRI outperformed those trained only on sMRI.

The secreted DNA has been shown to exert insecticidal effect against insect pests, which plays an adaptive role in plant-insect interactions, particularly in regulating populations of economically important sap-feeding insects. The molecular mechanisms behind this insecticidal effect are underinvestigated and remain largely unknown. Therefore, there is a need for more efforts in uncovering these mechanisms to better understand the plant-pest interactions, which would provide new insights into natural pest control strategies and inspire biotechnological applications. In the current work, we show that Pittosporum tobira (P. tobira) secretes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that exerts an insecticidal effect on Coccus hesperidum (C. hesperidum). We collected extracellular DNA from P. tobira leaves and tested its potential insecticidal effect by applying it to C. hesperidum, which is a well-known pest that causes damage to P. tobira. Our results reveal that the outermost layer of leaf cuticle of P. tobira predominantly contains single-stranded DNA of approximately 100 bases in length, originating from both chloroplast and nuclear genomes. This DNA exhibits pronounced insecticidal activity against C. hesperidum, with chloroplast-derived sequences significantly enriched compared to total DNA in intact plant cells. These findings suggest that the microevolution of the P. tobira nucleome and plastome contributed to the formation of extracellular DNA with insecticidal properties (eci-DNA) as part of its defence strategy against insect pests.

These methods not only struggle to generate near native conformations, but, more critically, they often fail to score and rank such conformations correctly, revealing fundamental limitations when applied to antibody-antigen systems. To address these limitations, we present DeepRank-Ab, a geometric deep learning-based scoring function tailored to the unique characteristics of antibody-antigen interfaces. Its development was enabled by a rigorously curated benchmark comprising more than 2.3 million decoys generated from 1,442 complexes, providing the diversity required for robust training and unbiased evaluation. Leveraging this resource, we systematically assessed multiple levels of graph representation, structural and energetic feature sets, and sampling strategies. Building on our previous DeepRank-GNN-esm work, our analysis identified that atom-level graph representation coupled with Voronoi-based surface decomposition and antibody-specific descriptors is the most effective formulation for accurate scoring. Across multiple independent test sets, including models from unbound unbound docking and structures generated by AlphaFold, DeepRank-Ab consistently outperforms all evaluated methods, including AF3, HADDOCK and state of the art scoring approach such as FTDMP. It increases the AF3 Top 1 success rate by 35.5% and improves the mean Top 1 DockQ by more than a factor of two. DeepRank-Ab further generalizes robustly beyond its training distribution, achieving 100% Top 5 success rate on external antibody-antigen CAPRI targets, surpassing all tested methods.

Nevertheless, a persistent empirical observation is that ordinary electric fans drastically reduce mosquito bites, even in the absence of chemical repellents. Here, we introduce a physics-guided, agent-based simulation demonstrating that mosquito host-seeking is not chemically inevitable but physically fragile. The model integrates directional airflow, vortex-induced chaotic mixing, and thermal decoy fields, and tracks 250 autonomous mosquito agents over 600 time-steps under Monte-Carlo sampling with independent randomized initializations. Three aerodynamic mechanisms were quantified. Mild upward airflow already reduces successful host localization by more than 80%, despite not mechanically preventing flight. Increasing vortex circulation produces a continuous, threshold-like collapse, reducing localization probability below 1% at moderate strength. Thermal decoys cause only a linear dilution of success, indicating misinformation alone cannot trigger collapse. A two-dimensional phase map reveals a robust \"invisibility region\" where airflow and vortex perturbations interact synergistically, eliminating host detection even when neither factor individually reaches threshold. These results show that mosquito host-seeking operates as a gradient-dependent failure system: once scalar fields lose spatial coherence, navigation collapses independent of sensory capability. This provides a quantitative theoretical basis for fan-mediated mosquito protection and suggests that non-chemical, low-energy airflow strategies can induce physical invisibility to hematophagous insects.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Kar4 functions with Ste12, the master transcriptional regulator of the yeast mating pheromone response, to promote the transcription of a subset of Ste12 targets required for mating. However, the mechanism by which Kar4 modulates Ste12 activity has remained uncertain. Here, we examined Kar4s function at the levels of transcription (RNA-seq) and Ste12 DNA binding (ChIP-exo). We show that Kar4 promotes Ste12 binding to nearly all Ste12 DNA-binding sites associated with transcriptionally-upregulated genes, even if their upregulation is not dependent on Kar4. We further found that the majority of Ste12-binding sites have two pheromone response elements (PREs) separated by four nucleotides in a head-to-tail orientation (H-T 4 motif). Sites associated with Kar4-dependent transcription have PREs with more mismatches and substantially lower Ste12 occupancy in kar4{Delta} cells than sites linked to Kar4-independent transcription. During the pheromone response in kar4{Delta} cells, Ste12 exhibits increased binding to non-H-T 4 motifs, particularly T-T 3 motifs, resulting in the abnormal upregulation of many genes not transcribed during the wild-type pheromone response. Therefore, we propose that Kar4 functions by increasing the DNA-binding specificity of Ste12 globally, promoting its binding primarily to H-T 4 motifs. Our model is consistent with previously-observed slower induction kinetics of Kar4-dependent genes via a feed-forward mechanism. Lastly, we uncovered several novel aspects of the pheromone response, including a broad role for the Crz1 transcription factor, induction of stress responses, and the identification of pheromone-responsive intergenic transcripts.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Peptide vaccines are a promising strategy, as they focus on short, synthetic peptides specifically selected to trigger a T-cell immune response.

Recent studies of primary progressive AOS have promoted a separation of prosodic and phonetic subtypes, aligning with a dual-motor coordination model separating the neural substrates of prosodic and phonetic function. Motivated by the limited corroboration of these subtypes in post-stroke AOS, here we present mapping results in a cohort of stroke survivors aiming to identify distinct neural substrates for prosodic and phonetic aspects of speech motor coordination. Methods: Left-hemisphere stroke survivors (n = 127; 64 with AOS) received speech-language evaluation and neuroimaging at the Center for the Study and Treatment of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR). AOS severity was quantified via the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale (ASRS). We utilized a novel lesion-symptom mapping technique with an emphasis on prediction that identifies ensembles of regions supporting performance in the prosodic and phonetic domains. Results: An ensemble of networks supporting prosodic function localized to dorsal and ventral (but primarily dorsal) sensorimotor cortex, as well as a distributed network of white matter pathways connecting Rolandic cortex to auditory regions and cerebellum, emphasizing the role of auditory feedback processing and laryngeal control in supporting prosodic function. A separate but partially overlapping network supporting phonetic function localized primarily to ventral Rolandic cortex and the arcuate fasciculus. Conclusions: This work represents the first mapping of prosodic and phonetic subtypes in post-stroke AOS in a large cohort of individuals. We hope our results motivate the development of assessment and treatment techniques individually targeting prosodic and phonetic functioning to better serve individuals with AOS and facilitate clinical discussion of the disorder.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Prion diseases are caused by conversion of the cellular prion protein to its pathological isoform PrPSc. Vaccination is considered a promising strategy to contain CWD, even though prion diseases do not show classical immune responses. For CWD containment, it is important that vaccines reduce shedding of prions in excreta, a major contributor to transmission. Here, we tested the effect of vaccines on prion shedding in feces and urine by vaccinating and prion infecting knock-in mice that recapitulate CWD pathogenesis as found in cervids. Vaccination reduced or even prevented CWD shedding in feces and urine collected between 30-90% of incubation time to disease. This is the first report showing that prion shedding can be blocked in a prion disease. For CWD specifically it may reduce the environmental prion burden and break the disease transmission cycle.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Stronger functional connectivity between brain language areas was associated with increased volume of parts of the cerebellum and motor cortex, together with smaller ventricles and sensory parietal and occipital areas. The brain structure-function language components mediated an association between vocabulary level and polygenic scores for reading ability. We report 18 genomic loci associated with brain structure-function language components. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimates for these components were 23-30%, and there was significant enrichment of heritability in primate-conserved genomic loci and fetal brain human-gained enhancer elements.

H.; Reese, R.; Koeglsperger, T.", "abstract": "Background: Elevated beta (12-32 Hz) activity in the local field potential (LFP) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and closely tied to synchronized spiking. Albeit the biomarker's prevalence has not been independently and reliably assessed, it is employed to guide deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implantation. Likewise, beta is under investigation to inform DBS programming and adaptive DBS. This study assesses the applicability of these efforts by quantifying the biomarker's prevalence and investigating its relationship to synchronized beta-bursting neurons. Methods: STN LFP and spiking activity of n = 156 patients with Parkinson's disease from six DBS centers recorded via microelectrodes was examined. Spectral peaks in the LFPs were classified and the absence of artifacts confirmed. The distribution of phase angles between beta LFP and spiking of individual beta-bursting neurons were explored. Findings: Bilateral beta LFP expression was observed in 47.25% of patients, and in 65.59% of hemispheres. LFP-synchronized neuronal spiking clustered in two-thirds of neurons at a primary and in one-third at a secondary LFP phase (182.84 degree phase shifted). This applied on the group level and for individual patients across different DBS centers. Interpretation: Beta-informed approaches mandate reliable biomarker expression, a requirement not met by slightly more than half of herein investigated patients. This is particularly troublesome for intraoperative guidance wherein the cause of biomarker absence, including DBS lead misplacement or a balanced ratio of phasic and antiphasic spiking neurons, cannot be determined, decreasing insight and increasing doubt. Although beta LFPs remain a valuable biomarker, routine clinical practice should not rely on beta alone; instead, multiple biomarkers (i.e. beta-gamma coupling, finely tuned gamma and/or cortico-cortical beta-band coupling) should be evaluated simultaneously to increase robustness.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

However, progress in this emerging field is hampered by the technical challenges and resource-intensive nature of acquiring datasets suitable for machine learning. Experimental recordings typically do not allow for interactive learning and generally lack ground-truth information that would enable rigorous algorithm development and validation. To overcome the limitations of experimental setups, simulated biophysical models of neurons and neuronal networks can serve as crucial accelerators.

However, psychedelics produce these effects across wide swaths of the brain. Based on our prior work, we hypothesized that engaging a specific brain circuit with focal brain stimulation during the window of enhanced plasticity produced by psychedelics would lead to more persistent alterations in the activity of that circuit. To test this, we administered either saline (SAL) or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to rats 24 hours prior to electrical stimulation targeting the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Brain activity was recorded before, during, and after stimulation using depth electrodes implanted in four bilateral frontostriatal regions. To assess changes in neural activity, we trained general logistic classifiers to distinguish between time points (e.g., pre-stimulation vs. post-stimulation) and then compared model performances across groups (e.g., LSD vs. SAL). As such, model performance represents the degree of difference between the two neural states (pre vs. post), and a significant difference between groups indicates a larger change in brain activity in one group. We found that LSD pretreatment, compared to SAL, resulted in larger and longer-lasting changes in brain activity following stimulation. Immunohistochemistry revealed that stimulation led to the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, and the combination of LSD and stimulation led to alterations in perineuronal net (PNN) integrity. Regardless of pretreatment, brain activity states recorded during stimulation did not capture the brain state that persisted in the minutes or days that followed. This work has important implications for understanding the general effects of brain stimulation and provides strong support for the development of psychedelic-assisted brain stimulation approaches. By increasing the durability of brain stimulation-induced changes in activity, this approach could lead to a reduction in relapse rates, which currently limit the impact of non-invasive stimulation treatments.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

This impedes our ability to understand how the devil population is evolving in response to the tumours. PCR-based diagnostics are available, but the technique is not field-applicable. To overcome these hurdles, we developed an ultrasensitive and field-deployable rapid diagnostic tool.

This system requires only portable laboratory equipment, making it more amenable to field conditions. The results showed that our test can detect DFT1 and DFT2 DNA within the attomolar range.

The close apposition of outer segments to the RPE is believed to be critical for maintaining this renewal process. Yet, in several retinal diseases, expansion of the subretinal space separating photoreceptors from the RPE does not immediately impact photoreceptor functionality. Here, we analyzed outer segment function and renewal in the Adam9 knockout mouse characterized by a major expansion of the subretinal space. Surprisingly, photoreceptor-RPE separation affected neither the sensitivity of photoreceptor light-responses nor the normal rate of outer segment renewal in this mouse prior to the onset of photoreceptor degeneration. The latter is achieved through the formation of elongated RPE pseudopods extending across the enlarged subretinal space to ingest outer segment tips. This work suggests that pseudopod formation may underlie the persistence of photoreceptor function in human diseases accompanied by photoreceptor-RPE separation, such as vitelliform macular dystrophy or age-related macular degeneration associated with subretinal drusenoid deposits.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We present a framework for engineering tunable oscillatory protein expression (repeated pulses in expression) using widely adopted molecular tools, applying them to modulate NGN3 expression. Single-cell time-lapse microscopy reveals that the Tet-On system unexpectedly generates asynchronous oscillations in protein expression under continuous doxycycline administration. These oscillations are dependent on protein instability and are not tunable by doxycycline concentration. In contrast, the dTAG degron system enables precise, reversible, concentration-dependent control of protein degradation and reaccumulation. Coupled with a constitutive promoter, we achieve synchronous oscillatory protein expression (COD: Constituitive promoter driving Oscillations via Degradation). Mathematical modelling identifies optimal dTAG drug addition and removal timings using the COD system to flexibly tune NGN3 oscillation periods while maintaining other oscillatory parameters (mean level and peak-to-trough fold-change). Using microfluidics (COD+CHIPS) we reproduce model-predicted 5 and 10 hours periodicities while maintaining similar mean levels and peak-to-trough fold-changes.

R.", "abstract": "Most arthropods are ectothermic, with multiple performance traits being constrained by environmental temperature. Through the effects on traits, temperature therefore constrains when, where, and how large are arthropod populations. Because many arthropods are of relevance to humans, for example as pests or disease vectors, biologists have spent substantial time trying to understand the mechanistic relationship between temperature and traits. For example, in mosquito and other vectors species, the lifespan of vectors - the number of days the adult survives -- is important in determining both the size of the vector population and whether or not vectors will likely be able to transmit pathogens. Often thermal traits such as lifetime are modeled using Thermal Performance Curves (TPC) -- functions that describe the relationship between temperature and traits mathematically. Many functional forms with many possible shapes have been proposed as TPCs. However, the effects of the distribution of data around these shapes and of common data transformations on how well we can infer the TCPs has been relatively ignored. In this paper we use simulated data on vector lifespans, inspired by mosquito data, to explore the reliability of inference under different assumptions about the data on our ability to accurately infer a known TPC. Using a Bayesian approach, we are also able to quantify the effects of data assumptions and transformations on uncertainty in estimates. Our results suggest that mismatches between a true and assumed distribution of data around a TPC can greatly increase uncertainty. Further, some transformations of the data before analysis are more likely to lead to biased results than others. Based on our results, we make suggestions for best practices in the analysis of arthropod thermal trait data such as lifespan and related traits.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Simultaneously, the microbes an animal interacts with are a critical and dynamic aspect of the host environment that can have profound impacts on their life history traits. As microbial environments diverge across animal lineages, life histories and their responses to such microbial contexts are expected to evolve as a consequence. Caenorhabditis nematodes are bacterivores that exhibit a diversity of life history strategies and fill diverse ecological niches. C. elegans thrives on rotting plants and grows rapidly with high fecundity; C. inopinata thrives in fresh figs and grows more slowly with lower fecundity. To understand how hosts with divergent life histories and ecologies respond to the microbes they interact with, we isolated over forty bacterial species from the natural fig environment of C. inopinata. This microbial survey revealed an isolate, Klebsiella sp. WOUb2, that doubles the population growth rate of C. inopinata. While this isolate also increases the population growth rate of C. elegans, Klebsiella sp. WOUb2 increases individual fecundity and developmental rate in C. elegans, whereas it only increases developmental rate of C. inopinata. Thus, fitness is modulated by variable life history mechanisms in the two species. Comparisons with nucleotide databases reveal Klebsiella sp. WOUb2 is closely related to other Klebsiella isolates known to influence Caenorhabditis nematode fitness. Additionally, the similarity of Klebsiella sp. WOUb2 to microbes associated with fig wasps and figs suggests C. inopinata frequently encounters this microbe in its natural context.

G.; Perrone, B.; Canciani, B.; Schaeffer, C.; Rampoldi, L.", "abstract": "Background: Mutations in UMOD, encoding uromodulin, lead to Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD), a genetic cause of kidney failure. UMOD mutations have a common gain-of-toxic-function effect, causing mutant uromodulin retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This leads to ER stress, alteration of protein homeostasis and mitochondrial dynamics, defective autophagy and increased cell death. Calorie restriction (CR) exerts a beneficial role in diseases characterized by accumulation of pathogenic protein and inflammation, by modulating several pathways, including autophagy induction and suppression of inflammation and fibrosis. Given the relevance of these features in ADTKD, we investigated the effect of CR on disease onset and progression. Methods: Transgenic mice expressing C147W uromodulin (TgUmodC147W) were subjected to a moderate (30%) CR regimen for 15 or 24 weeks, starting at different stages of disease progression. Results: CR restored autophagy, as shown by decreased P62 punctae and quenched mTOR activation specifically in mutant uromodulin expressing cells, it recovered expression of key ER-phagy receptor genes, with a concomitant, striking reduction of mutant uromodulin ER retention. In pre-symptomatic TgUmodC147W mice, CR alleviates epithelial cell stress. This, likely along with a direct anti-inflammatory effect of CR, prevents inflammation and progressive decline of kidney function. At this early disease stage, CR ameliorates the already established kidney damage and reduces fibrosis, suggesting reversal of ADTKD phenotype. CR was also effective in significantly delaying disease progression in TgUmodC147W mice with advanced disease and already compromised kidney function. Conclusion: Our findings establish the proof-of-principle that counteracting the primary effect of UMOD mutations by stimulating autophagy and quenching inflammation prevents disease onset and progression.

We applied CyTOF and a 20-marker antibody panel to detect and phenotype CTCs directly in liquid biopsies of 51 SCLC patients (treatment-naive, chemotherapy and immunotherapy-treated, and tarlatamab-treated), of which a subset were longitudinally tracked. Unsupervised clustering revealed distinct cell populations enriched in patient liquid biopsies compared to those from healthy donors. Further analysis identified CTC populations of the three established SCLC subtypes driven by the high expression of ASCL1, NeuroD1, and POU2F3 transcription factors respectively. Significant differences in CTC EMT markers, established therapeutic targets (e.g. DLL3), and subtype heterogeneity were observed between naive versus treated samples. Changes in subtype proportions were observed in longitudinally tracked samples in both treatment modalities.

Most of the gene signatures were prognostic, and one was prognostic for HER2+ breast cancer, outperforming previously reported HER2+ signatures. Interestingly, it did not include VEGF as variable, and multivariate Cox analysis further highlighted ANGPT2 as a key gene, suggesting that VEGF-independent neovascularization plays an important role in breast cancer. Next, we constructed a network linking mRNAs and regulatory RNAs involved in pathological angiogenesis; this analysis revealed three novel lncRNAs that may play a role in angiogenesis and tumor development.

Current risk assessment frameworks, in the absence of empiric chemical-specific data, generally recommend default or probabilistic adjustment factors to account for such variability. We present an experimental approach to incorporate common genetic variants potentially impacting population-level differences in toxicant susceptibility into human cell-based models for any cellular apical endpoint of interest. We focus on the genes with the most common aggregate loss-of-function (LoF) alleles in the gnomAD v3.0 data which we designated as the PopVarLoF set. Unexpectedly, enrichment analysis of these genes found significant overrepresentation of gene products playing important functional roles in toxicology. Interrogation of GWAS and PheWAS databases found that these genes are associated with diverse metabolic phenotypes consistent with the relevance of the PopVarLoF set in studying variability of toxicant response in human populations. We further characterized the PopVarLoF set by developing custom lentiviral CRISPR knockout libraries targeting the PopVarLoF genes to assess their functional essentiality in the HepG2/C3A cell line. Functional disruption of 14 of the PopVarLoF genes (~1 %) without toxicant exposure resulted in significant growth defects in this cell line, consistent with the majority of PopVarLoF gene products having non-essential roles. The development of human cell-based toxicity assays or other NAMs which include the empiric assessment of common genetic sources of population variability in susceptibility to chemical exposure could contribute to more robust risk assessment which protects vulnerable populations while reducing uncertainty.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

The short-chain fatty acid receptor FFA2R (GPR43) recognizes propionate and allosteric ligands such as Cmp58 and AZ1729. We characterized FFA2R signaling and allosteric modulation using multiple cell models including HEK293, HL60 cells and primary human neutrophils. Methods FFA2R activation was assessed using complementary assays in HEK293 and HL60 cells as well as primary human neutrophils. G protein activation and {beta}-arrestin recruitment were profiled using ebBRET biosensors. Ca2+ mobilization was measured with Fura-2, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was quantified by isoluminol chemiluminescence. Pharmacological tools included the FFA2R antagonist CATPB, the Gq inhibitor YM-254890, and pertussis toxin (PTX). Results Propionate activated all tested G proteins except G12 in HEK293 cells and recruited both {beta}-arrestin1 and {beta}-arrestin2. The allosteric ligands Cmp58 and AZ1729 behaved as pathway-selective ago-PAMs. Alone they engaged a limited subset of G proteins with minimal {beta}-arrestin recruitment, whereas in the presence of propionate they selectively potentiated Gi1 while attenuating Gq/11 and Gi2/3. Fura-2 measurements coupled to YM-254890 treatment established that FFA2R couples to Gq-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in HEK293 cells; Cmp58, but not AZ1729, enhanced Ca2+ responses at submaximal propionate concentrations. In primary neutrophils, propionate elicited Ca2+ transients but did not trigger NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS on its own. Either Cmp58 or AZ1729 enabled propionate-driven ROS, and their combination produced robust ROS. Transient FFA2R expression in HL60 cells reconstituted this neutrophil-like functional profile, including allosteric activation of ROS. Conclusions Across systems, Ca2+ mobilization emerged as a conserved, receptor-proximal output of FFA2R, while allosteric modulation by Cmp58 and AZ1729 promoted Gi/o-biased signaling that enabled ROS generation. These data define pathway-selective allosterism at FFA2R and highlight Ca2+ mobilization and ROS as informative readouts for therapeutic strategies that exploit allosteric control.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Using a multi-faceted approach, we show that numerous classical membrane and secreted glycoproteins localize to the nucleus with N-glycan modifications, exemplified by the cell adhesion molecule L1CAM.

Supporting this, we previously demonstrated that CD8 T cells, immune cells capable of targeting senescent cells, increasingly develop characteristics of senescence with advancing age in humans. Here, we further characterized the senescence state of human SA-{beta}Gal-expressing CD8 T effector cells, their functional capabilities, and their involvement in aging and disease. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that SA-{beta}Gal-expressing CD8 T cells with unique transcriptional signatures develop in all stages of T cell differentiation, including in effector memory (EM) T cells. SA-{beta}Gal-expressing CD8 TEM cells expressed various classical markers of senescence and were significantly impaired in their ability to proliferate, produce cytokines, and eliminate senescent human stromal cells, compared to CD8 TEM cells with low SA-{beta}Gal activity. Gene signatures of senescent SA-{beta}Gal-expressing CD8 TEM cells were enriched in CD8 T cells from older human donors, patients with age-related disorders, cancer, and smokers. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that T cell senescence is distinct from and dominant over T cell exhaustion, limiting the response of CD8 TEM cells to immunotherapy.

Understanding how basal cells maintain normal airways provides a foundation for interpreting their dysfunction in disease states and for the development of novel therapies. The airway epithelium exists in a dynamic state in which basal stem cells replace lost luminal mucosecretory and multiciliated cell types via an intermediate suprabasal cell state. The ability to isolate basal cells with high progenitor cell potential would be beneficial in regenerative medicine applications, but the molecular identity of this population is unclear. Here, we evaluate candidate surface markers to isolate human basal cells. As an individual marker, we found that podoplanin (PDPN) had a favorable sensitivity and specificity compared with integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6) or nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). We found that KRT5-expressing basal cells could be subdivided into those with high or low PDPN expression; KRT5-negative cells did not express PDPN. In vitro, PDPN-high basal cells had higher colony-forming capacity, increased population doubling potential and formed larger colonies than PDPN-low basal cells. PDPN-high basal cells expressed higher levels of TP63, as well as other genes expressed by quiescent or resting basal cells identified in single cell RNA sequencing studies.

Osmotic shifts, pore-forming toxins, and the growth of luminal polymers or pathogens all stand to increase lysosomal membrane tension and/or disrupt the bilayer. In some contexts, this leads to lysosomal rupture and cell death. Here we describe a mechanism that enables lysosomes to sense and respond to acute increases in tension of their limiting membrane. We report that the lysosome-resident non-selective cation channel, TMEM63A, can drive the directional flux of monovalent cations, major osmoticants, out of the lumen when gated by mechanical tension on the organelle. This results in the ability for lysosomes to relieve hydrostatic pressure and, proportionally, membrane tension, affording lysosomes the time to acquire additional lipids. Lysosomes without this mechanism -either because TMEM63A is deleted or in the case when cells express disease-causing variants of TMEM63A- are an order of magnitude more sensitive to lysis upon increases to their membrane tension when compared to their wildtype counterparts. These findings suggest that lysosomes are capable of regulating hydrostatic pressure and volume in response to high tension.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We have developed the Wnt-induced osteogenic tissue model (WIOTM), a platform that recapitulates human osteogenesis, and identified acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ac) as a critical epigenetic regulator in human skeletal stem cells (hSSCs). In WIOTM, localized Wnt signals drive asymmetric cell division (ACD), yielding a proximal hSSC with high H3K14ac and a distal daughter with reduced H3K14ac that migrates into the 3D collagen matrix and initiates osteogenic differentiation. Disrupting H3K14ac in hSSCs abrogates ACD and WIOTM formation. To test whether hSSCs maintain H3K14ac in vivo, we formed the WIOTM on Wnt-functionalized polymer bandages and transplanted them into calvarial defects. The WIOTM contributed to bone repair, and human cells adjacent to the bandages retained high H3K14ac despite the injury environment.

CRISPR-based approaches can overcome this limitation by establishing direct causal connections between genes and toxicological phenotypes. Moreover, CRISPR screens enable scalable and systematic interrogation of gene function and associated mechanisms following chemical exposure, predominantly using in vitro models. In line with the paradigm of new approach methodologies (NAMs) in toxicology research, CRISPR screens hold promise to provide an in vitro cell-based functional toxicogenomics approach. One of the main limitations of conventional in vitro assays is their compromised physiological relevance to humans due to their inability to fully recapitulate in vivo physiology. To improve the functional and physiological relevance of the toxicogenomics approach, we developed a 3D CRISPR screening system using HepG2/C3A spheroids generated and cultivated in a continuously rotating bioreactor (ClinoStar). We first performed time-course 3D CRISPR screens to identify genes that confer growth disadvantage or advantage, influencing spheroid development compared to 2D cultures. We then applied this approach to a chemical toxicity study using doxorubicin, comparing the performance of the 3D and 2D systems in identifying chemical-specific mechanisms. The results showed that the 3D system captured more candidate genetic determinants and biological pathways related to DNA damage processes, a known toxicity mechanism of doxorubicin, demonstrating improved performance in identifying chemical-specific pathways over the 2D counterpart. In our screens, we employed custom CRISPR sgRNA libraries representing common human loss-of-function genetic variants (mean allele frequency > 0.1% in all individuals catalogued in the genome aggregation database), which potentially affect toxicity responses. By comparing our CRISPR screen results with previously reported genetic associations for doxorubicin response, we found that the 3D system identified more known associated genes than the 2D system. Together, the 3D CRISPR screening system demonstrated its feasibility and utility for physiologically relevant functional toxicogenomics.

Here we utilized in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) to systematically map Oprm1 mRNA and MOR protein throughout the habenular complex. We studied both rat and mouse tissue to evaluate conserved expression across two common research species. Importantly, we found mRNA and protein in both the MHb and LHb in both.

In LHb, MOR labeling was most dense in intermediate sections along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis.

Silencing of the 6mA demethylase genes minmad-1 significantly reduced egg hatching, revealing that 6mA-mediated regulation is required for nematode development. Transcriptome analyses showed that minmad-1 knockdown downregulated genes involved in embryogenesis, RNA biosynthesis, and cell differentiation, suggesting a critical role of 6mA in developmental gene regulation. Among the transcription factors affected by minmad-1 silencing, Mi-nhr-118, a nuclear hormone receptor orthologous to C. elegans nhr-118, was identified as a key regulator of embryonic development. Functional assays confirmed that RNAi or host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) of Mi-nhr-118 led to developmental arrest, reduced gall and egg mass formation, and impaired infectivity across multiple Meloidogyne species.

Despite this revival, remarkably little is known about their evolution. One of the most intriguing psychedelic compounds is psilocybin, the compound found in 'magic' mushrooms and used in ritual ceremonies in Central America for generations. Associated with agaricomycete fungi of the genus Psilocybe, psilocybin acts in a similar way to the neurotransmitter serotonin, yet how and why natural selection favoured its biosynthesis remains unclear. Given the resemblance to serotonin, modulation of invertebrate behaviour for defence is a likely explanation, but neither this nor alternative hypotheses have ever been formally tested. Here, we show that Drosophila larvae exposed to extracts from Psilocybe mushrooms exhibit reduced survival, pupation rates, and inhibited locomotion. Adults exposed during development show reduced thorax and wing size, along with increased fluctuating asymmetry, indicating developmental stress. Conversely, mutants lacking 5HT2A receptors showed the same response to Psilocybe extracts as wild-type flies. Furthermore, DNA metabarcoding revealed that while Psilocybe semilanceata demonstrates a distinct invertebrate community compared to most other grassland fungi, it overlapped with the non-psychedelic species Mycena epipterygia.

Identifying reliable, accessible, and cost-effective spatial predictors of genetic diversity would significantly enhance our ability to incorporate genetic diversity into conservation efforts. Caribbean coral reefs represent a compelling system for investigating such predictors, as these ecosystems face unprecedented threats from disease outbreaks and climate change. Here, we investigate the utility of several environmental proxies as surrogates for genetic diversity, which may be useful for conservation planning in resource- or data-poor regions. To achieve this goal, we used reduced-representation genomic sequencing to estimate intraspecific genetic diversity, and in doing so, identified two genetically distinct and sympatric cryptic coral species in the Agaricia tenuifolia species complex. We employed a causal inference approach to assess the relationships between genetic alpha diversity and habitat area and connectivity, habitat heterogeneity, and temperature. Statistical investigations revealed that increased habitat heterogeneity, derived from remotely sensed habitat maps, was associated with lower genetic diversity within coral populations, suggesting that habitat characteristics promoting species diversity may not maintain high genetic diversity within a single species. Habitat area and connectivity, and temperature have predominantly negative effects on genetic diversity with coral habitat area and connectivity showing markedly contrasting responses in two cryptic taxa. Thus, our findings reveal that context matters greatly, as results differ between cryptic species, across variables, and among spatial scales.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

B.; Ge, Z.-D.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The myocardium in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) exhibits immature metabolic programming, impaired mitochondrial quality control, and heightened susceptibility to ischemic and hypoxic injury during palliative surgery. The long non-coding RNA H19 suppresses translation of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) mRNA and modulates mitochondrial quality control and ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) in adult hearts. Whether and how H19 regulates mitophagy and IRI in HLHS or in immature animals remains unknown. METHODS: We investigated H19 regulation and its role in mitophagy and ischemia/reperfusion or hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in myocardial tissue from HLHS patients, HLHS-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (HLHS-iPSC-CMs), and immature rat hearts. Mechanistic interactions among H19, PINK1/Parkin signaling, and mitophagosome formation were assessed using loss-of-function approaches. RESULTS: HLHS myocardium exhibited markedly elevated H19 expression, accompanied by reduced PINK1 and Parkin protein abundance and diminished mitophagosome formation. Similar findings were observed in HLHS-iPSC-CMs exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation and in immature rat hearts subjected to myocardial IRI. H19 knockdown in HLHS-iPSC-CMs attenuated hypoxia/reoxygenation?induced lactate dehydrogenase release and restored PINK1 and Parkin protein levels. In immature rats, myocardial H19 silencing reduced infarct size, enhanced mitochondrial PINK1 and Parkin expression, and improved post-reperfusion cardiac function for up to 28 days. Conversely, knockdown of PINK1 or Parkin reduced mitophagosome formation and exacerbated functional deterioration during IRI. CONCLUSIONS: H19 upregulation impairs PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy and increases susceptibility to ischemic and hypoxic injury in HLHS and the immature heart. These findings identify H19 as a key regulator of mitochondrial quality control and a potential therapeutic target for mitigating IRI in early-life cardiac disease.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Research on fear extinction points to a critical role for opioid receptors in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) in computing the aversive prediction error signal that is generated when there is a difference between expected and actual aversive events. Based on these fear extinction findings, we hypothesized that vlPAG opioid signaling might also support the early stages of avoidance learning. To test this, 15 Wistar rats (7 females, 8 males) received intra-vlPAG infusions of either naloxone hydrochloride (n = 7, 2.5 g/0.5 l), a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, or vehicle (n = 8, 0.5 l), immediately before the first and second session of two-way active avoidance training. No infusions were given before the third session, to examine avoidance performance under continued, drug-free acquisition. For the fourth and final session, drug conditions were reversed to examine the acute effect of naloxone on already established avoidance performance. Our results indicated that intra-vlPAG naloxone did not impair avoidance acquisition, nor its performance. These findings suggest that opioid signaling in the vlPAG may not be essential for the initial learning or expression of two-way active avoidance.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Using mathematical modelling and experiments in linear gradients of the non-degradable cAMP analogue Sp-cAMPS, we show that ligand concentration alone does not describe chemotactic behaviour. By expressing signals as the differential proportion of activated receptors ({Delta}{Omega}), we find that cells can detect differences as small as 0.026% across their length. Importantly, the minimum differential required to induce bias increases with overall receptor activation, demonstrating that chemotactic sensitivity depends on the receptor occupancy regime rather than on {Delta}C. The true minimal chemotactic threshold therefore lies at concentrations that minimise receptor activation while still eliciting a bias, and is likely to be below 0.026%.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We molecularly assessed mice with the missense variant, R47H (Trem2*R47HHSS), and mice with additional cryptic splicing and reduced Trem2 expression (Trem2*R47H) while comparing relevance to human LOAD. METHODS: The aberrant splice acceptor site in the Trem2*R47H mouse was humanized resulting in the Trem2*R47H humanized splice site (Trem2*R47HHSS) mouse. RNA sequencing was performed on mouse brain tissue and signatures were compared to human postmortem brain expression in LOAD cohorts. RESULTS: Trem2*R47H mice had alternative splicing leading to reduced Trem2 expression; Trem2*R47HHSS mice expressed Trem2 at wild-type transcript and protein levels. Both models correlated with similar LOAD-associated signatures, and had similar effects on immune response, synapse, and vasculature biodomains. The Trem2*R47H model additionally affected extracellular matrix and myelination signatures.

J.", "abstract": "Evolutionary loss of digits and limbs occurred many times during the diversification of tetrapods. The limbs of the earliest tetrapods were polydactylous, bearing as many 8 digits, but after the pentadactyly (five digits) was stabilized, no lineage evolved more than five digits per limb but many underwent digit loss. Within mammals, digit 1 (thumb on the forelimb or hallux on the hindlimb) is lost most frequently and is typically the first digit to disappear. Evidence from numerous studies of limb development shows that digit 1 development is controlled by mechanisms that are at least partially independent of the posterior 4 digits. In addition, evolutionary loss of digit 1 occurred independently in forelimbs and hindlimbs. Despite the frequency of digit loss in mammals, the underlying genetic mechanisms have not been uncovered. We used comparative genomics and bioinformatics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of genomic changes associated with digit 1 loss in the forelimbs and/or hindlimbs of 65 mammalian species. We identified a set of conserved non-coding elements that evolved in concert with independent (parallel) losses of digit 1. These elements, which are frequently near genes with known roles in digit development, underwent accelerated evolution in digit-reduced lineages. Furthermore, we find that elements with accelerated rates of evolution show significant loss of binding sites for transcription factors that are crucial for anterior digit development. The results suggest that cis-regulatory elements important for the development of digit 1 are evolutionarily accelerated in mammalian lineages that underwent reduction and loss of digit 1.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Notably, in vitro base PARylation by PARP1 in single stranded DNA (ssDNA) was demonstrated at N1-deoxyadenosine (N1-dA). Here, we report that PARP1 catalyzes N3-specific ADP-ribosylation of deoxycytidine (N3-dC) in single-stranded DNA. Analogous to N1-dA PARylation, which is prone to spontaneous adenine-to-inosine deamination, N3-dC PARylation promotes cytosine deamination, yielding N3-PARylated-deoxyuridine. These deamination products yield diagnostic PARylation signatures in LC-MS/MS, namely N1-ribosyl-deoxyinosine (N1-r-dI) and N3-ribosyl-deoxyuridine (N3-r-dU). We synthesized both N1-r-dI and N3-r-dU as diagnostic standards and established absolute quantification of base ADP-ribosylations by LC-MS/MS. Quantitative analysis of PARylated dA and dC in ssDNA reveals pronounced sequence preferences of PARP1. Removal of these base modifications differs markedly, since ADP-ribose glycohydrolase TARG1 removes PAR from both dA and dC, whereas PARG acts exclusively on dA.

Mechanistically, loss of SMAD4 induces replication stress by promoting transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), which induces chromosomal breaks and subsequent mitotic errors, leading to the concomitant emergence of structural and numerical CIN. While the tumor suppressor function of SMAD4 has been predominantly attributed to TGFbeta signaling, we find that its role in genome maintenance operates via BMP signaling and its transcriptional target gene ID3. Consequently, inhibition of BMP signaling mimics the loss of SMAD4 whereas re-expression of SMAD4 or ID3 suppresses TRCs, replication stress and mitotic errors in SMAD4-deficient cancer cells.

Although the molecular responses and toxicity effects of PFOS exposure have been extensively studied, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the causal mechanisms leading to PFOS-associated adverse effects. To help bridge this gap, we conducted CRISPR screens in HepG2/C3A human liver cells exposed to IC25 (170 uM) of PFOS to identify genes and pathways influencing PFOS-induced cytotoxicity. Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout library targeting 18,819 genes, we identified 340 candidate genes that modulate PFOS-induced cytotoxicity when genetically disrupted (189 gene disruptions increased sensitivity and 151 gene disruptions increased resistance). From these candidate genes, we individually disrupted two candidate genes, SLC6A9 which encodes the glycine transporter GlyT1, and CPSF2, and confirmed increased resistance to PFOS exposure. Further, molecular docking analysis predicts that PFOS directly binds to GlyT1 and functional inhibition of GlyT1 also increases resistance to PFOS exposure. Gene-Disease outcome association analysis using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) indicated an enrichment of candidate genes associated with cancer-related and liver disease phenotypes. KEGG and STRING enrichment analyses found over representation of several biological pathways including DNA damage response and cell cycle. Lastly, cross-species conservation analysis using the top two validated gene targets found that their pathways were highly conserved in several environmentally relevant species.

Upon receptor activation, UVRAG, acting independently of autophagy, recruits and activates the E3-ligase ITCH to catalyze K27-linked ubiquitination of membrane-tethered NOTCH1, thereby licensing ESCRT-dependent lysosomal degradation.

In this study, we investigated their functional role in the hatching gland. The loss of either subunit resulted in a significant delay in normal hatching. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we show that both mutants exhibited severe defects in the hatching gland patterning, including a reduced number of hatching gland cells. The mutants displayed changes in the transcript levels of several hatching gland markers and reduced cell proliferation in this organ. These developmental defects were intensified by a late-stage functional failure characterized by decreased cathepsin synthesis, reduced proteolytic activity, and delay in the period of secretion in both mutants.

Addressing these complexities requires a multidisciplinary approach. Recent advances in network analysis and machine learning offer powerful tools for examining and interpreting complex network structures, aiding in the identification and quantification of movement patterns and the prediction of behavioural changes. Here we use a comparative approach leveraging network analysis and machine learning techniques to assess commonalities in standard theoretical social structures governing networks across the animal kingdom. We investigate how these theoretical structures explain social organization at different scales, from entire populations to smaller groups. By leveraging interpretable machine learning techniques, we examine the predictive power of species and network construction techniques in predicting structural features of animal social networks. We found that geometric graphs are the frequently predicted network model across the animal kingdom. These graphs represent both spatial and social processes and are formed by positioning individuals uniformly on a 2D plane, with links established based on proximity within a specified distance. In particular, geometric graphs demonstrate structural similarities with interaction types and data collection methods. For example, we found that this graph model had strong structural similarities with networks derived from physical contact and spatial proximity data. Networks with small-world properties, in contrast, were rare across all interaction types and collection methods. Additionally, the occurrence of these networks is influenced by the identity of species and sampling duration. Although incorporating species identity into the classification model did not improve the accuracy of the prediction, it enabled us to account for the varying dependencies of biological characteristics on specific behaviours. This study highlights the value of predictive modelling for uncovering ecological drivers of animal network structures. By focusing on standard theoretical models that are well established in network science, we connect animal social networks to broader theoretical findings, while recognizing that more tailored models combining multiple generative models or network properties may offer deeper insights into network structures.

Here, we show that Drosophila melanogaster larvae exhibit a previously unrecognized rapid escape behavior triggered by food contaminated with metabolically active Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15 (E. cc15), a natural bacterial pathogen of flies and plants. Stationary-phase cells fail to elicit avoidance, demonstrating that larval detection of E. cc15 depends on bacterial metabolic activity rather than on its mere presence. Using targeted genetic manipulations, we identify two chemosensory pathways required for this response: a gustatory input mediated by the aversion receptor Gr33a and an olfactory input mediated by the Or49a-Orco complex. Disrupting either pathway abolishes escape, revealing that larvae integrate complementary contact-dependent and volatile cues to evaluate microbial danger. Functionally, escape enables larvae to reach uncontaminated food and partially mitigates the developmental impact of early pathogen exposure. However, dispersing larvae also transfer viable bacteria to new substrates, indicating that this defensive response can simultaneously promote pathogen spread.

The genetically tractable fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is increasingly used to study social behavior and exhibits a wide range of sociability phenotypes. However, previous studies have relied on distinct behavioral paradigms, limiting cross-context comparisons and motivating a more extensive characterization of sociability in this species. Here, we quantified sociability in D. melanogaster using a multidimensional approach encompassing three paradigms that capture engagement in group activities across contexts: (1) preference for communal versus solitary egg-laying, (2) egg-laying latency in a group, and (3) frequency and duration of spontaneous social interactions and interindividual distance. We assessed these behaviors in 105 lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel and observed substantial variation in responses to conspecific presence across paradigms. Sociability-related behaviors differed between genetically distinct lines, indicating a genetic component. However, the three sociability traits were uncorrelated, demonstrating that sociability in D. melanogaster is multidimensional.

Resting-state fMRI from 726 healthy young adults was aligned to quarterly macroeconomic indicators using the HCP \"Quarter\" variable. I quantified intrinsic organization using network functional connectivity (FC) and network-level amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF). I implemented (1) a quasi-natural experiment contrasting a pre- vs post-gasoline-price shock (collapse) cohort, and (2) quarter-level partial correlations between network measures and four macro indicators, including gasoline price, consumer sentiment, unemployment, and stock market return. Post-shock participants showed significantly higher within-network FC across all seven networks and selective increases in between-network coupling concentrated among sensory and attention systems, as well as limbic-default interactions. ALFF exhibited bidirectional shifts: Visual ALFF increased post-shock, whereas Limbic and Frontoparietal ALFF were higher pre-shock. Quarter-level analyses mirrored this differential pattern, with gas price positively associated with Limbic and Frontoparietal ALFF and negatively with Visual and Dorsal Attention ALFF. Across macro indicators, gasoline price and consumer sentiment showed the most widespread FC associations, with largely opposing correlation signatures, while unemployment and equity returns were comparatively weak after correction.

This study investigated the effects of NSF loss on the survival of D2R-expressing cells and on mouse behaviour. We generated D2R-specific NSF conditional knockout (Nsff/f;D2R-Cre) mice. Targeted deletion of NSF in D2R-expressing cells led to a significant decrease in D2R-expressing neurons, accompanied by increased apoptosis during postnatal development, reduced striatal volume, and substantially lowered dopamine levels in the striatum. Further evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction was shown by reduced dopamine transporter expression in the striatum and tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the striatum and substantia nigra. The Nsff/f;D2R-Cre mice exhibited attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviours, including hyperactivity and impulsivity. Notably, combined administration of methylphenidate and a D2R agonist effectively alleviated hyperactivity and impulsivity, indicating a potential synergistic approach for ADHD treatment. These findings highlight the critical role of NSF in the survival of D2R-expressing neurons and suggest that disruption of the NSF-D2R interaction may contribute to ADHD-like phenotypes. This study underscores the translational relevance of the Nsff/f;D2R-Cre model for ADHD and suggests that targeting D2R dysfunction, particularly in treatment-resistant cases, may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ADHD.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to enhance MEG spatial resolution through learning inter-modal relationships via data-driven fusion with BOLD-fMRI using explainable machine learning (xML). Methods: MEG and BOLD-fMRI data were collected for sixteen participants watching the same naturalistic visual stimulus. MEG signals were filtered into standard frequency bands and processed to match the haemodynamic response. Data were then decomposed using Tensorial Independent Component Analysis (TICA), yielding 250 MEG (25 per frequency band) and 30 BOLD-fMRI components. A set of Extreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) models were trained to predict MEG component activity from downsampled BOLD-fMRI components. The models with best-performing configuration of hyperparameters at this resolution were then used to generate voxelwise upsampled MEG maps using the natively higher-resolution BOLD-fMRI data. Performance was compared to trilinear interpolation using R2, mean squared error (MSE), and structural similarity index (SSI). Model interpretability was enhanced by generating Shapley values (SHAP), describing relationships between input data and model output. Results Models trained on 6mm3 data achieved high predictive performance on previously unseen data (R2 = 0.80, MSE = .07). Using higher-resolution 2mm3 BOLD-fMRI data, MEG activity was upsampled to 2mm3, resulting in more detailed image, while maintaining reasonable congruence to naive interpolation (R2 = .81, MSE = .06). Conclusions: This work demonstrates that explainable machine learning enables spatial super-resolution of MEG maps via BOLD-fMRI-informed quality transfer, enabling enhancement of spatial resolution, and offering improved localization, as well as means of generating data-driven insights into neurovascular coupling.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

In this study, we identified and characterized Scube2 as a novel regulator in coronary vessel formation and heart regeneration. Scube2 is expressed in the epicardium covering the coronary vasculature under homeostatic conditions in adult hearts and is strongly upregulated after cardiac injury. Zebrafish scube2 mutant exhibits reduced coronary vessel coverage during cardiac growth and pronounced myocardial defects, including abnormal vessel morphology, disorganized contractile fibers, and mitochondrial damage. Following injury, scube2 mutant hearts show impaired revascularization and persistent fibrosis, indicating defective regeneration. Mechanistically, transcriptomic profiling of scube2 mutant hearts reveals attenuated expression of angiogenic-related genes, including those mediated by vascular endothelial and platelet-derived growth factors, consistent with reduced proliferation of endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes during repair. In a gain-of-function setting, SCUBE2 enhances platelet-derived growth factor signaling by promoting receptor activation in HEK293 cells.

Even so, the immediate and delayed fitness consequences of GIP in unmanaged wild mammal populations, particularly during the sensitive and energetically demanding early life stage, remain largely unknown. Methods: We investigate non-invasively the effects of GIP during early life on the survival to adulthood, age at first reproduction and longevity of 68 individually known female spotted hyenas in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We also test whether a high investment in gastrointestinal local immunity (i.e. faecal mucin and immunoglobulin A) and an elevated allostatic load (i.e. faecal glucocorticoid metabolites) decrease these measures of performance, when controlling for resource availability and maternal effects (i.e. maternal social rank) using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Ancylostoma sp. infections and the level of immunoglobulin A both negatively associate with survival to adulthood, probably because of the damage caused by the parasite and resource allocation trade-off between immunity and maintenance. Conversely, maternal social rank has a positive influence on survival to adulthood and longevity. Immune responses, allostatic load and GIP do not affect the age at first reproduction, suggesting either no effect, a complex interaction between different life stages, or a more immediate time-dependent effect.

M.; Fang, Y.", "abstract": "Monitoring and managing the public health risk posed by marine biotoxins is a daunting challenge. With expansive coastlines, 1000s of seafood species, and dozens of biotoxins, monitoring cannot occur everywhere at once. Improving the cost-effectiveness of biotoxin monitoring is thus critical to expanding coverage to include more species, toxins, and locations. Notably, understanding the rate at which seafood species depurate biotoxins can be used to optimize the cadence of monitoring. We conducted a systematic review to collate marine biotoxin depuration rates and synthesize the factors that influence them; identify knowledge gaps, best practices, and research priorities; and generate predictions of depuration rates for unstudied species. We found that only 85 marine species have been studied for their biotoxin depuration rates. Depuration rates for non-bivalves and for toxins besides paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are especially understudied. Depuration half-lives varied from 0.03 to 1269 days based on species, toxin, tissue, and environmental conditions. In general, depuration accelerates with increased temperature and food availability, with implications for aquaculture siting, depuration enhancement, and biotoxin monitoring. We identified unstudied bivalve and finfish species that are highly produced and vulnerable to HABs that are high priorities for future research. Finally, we used a Bayesian regression model to predict PST depuration rates for 102 unstudied bivalve species, the only clade-syndrome with sufficient training data. These predictions can guide efficient monitoring and management until lab- or field-based depuration rates become available. We recommend that future studies directly estimate depuration rates to ensure their comparability across studies and utility to managers.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We introduce a new family of models called regularised conditional clade distributions (regCCD), which apply regularisation to balance sample fidelity against overfitting, thereby combining the strengths of existing parameterisations. We show that regCCD outperforms existing models in capturing the posterior distribution and provides better point estimates than its underlying model.

However, genomic data are typically siloed across institutions, and privacy constraints often preclude centralized analysis. While federated learning (FL) offers a viable alternative by enabling cross-site computation without sharing individual-level data, applying mixed models, which are essential for correcting population structure, in a distributed setting remains a challenge in terms of statistical accuracy and computational scalability. Here, we present a federated mixed-model framework for GWAS that achieves high fidelity to centralized analyses while maintaining efficiency at biobank scale. Building on mixed-model theory and distributed optimization, we introduce algorithms for continuous (FedLMM) and binary (FedGLMM) traits that perform parameter estimation and association testing through site-local computation and aggregation of intermediate statistics. Comprehensive simulations spanning varied sample sizes and genomic densities demonstrate that our methods closely mirror centralized benchmarks (fastGWA and fastGWA-GLMM). Effect-size estimates exhibit near-perfect correlation, and over 99% of significant loci are recovered with well-controlled type I error rates. Empirical analyses on ~100,000 UK Biobank participants further confirm that the framework delivers consistent inference while sustaining high computational performance.

Phenotypic assays revealed that this strain exhibits distinct growth and recovery dynamics under salinity, temperature, and UV stress compared to conspecific strains isolated from tree bark. To investigate the genomic basis of its adaptation, we generated a high-quality 41.8 Mbp de novo genome assembly with 11,529 predicted proteins. Across Hypoxylaceae genomes, we identified variably sized and dispersed AT-rich isochores, which in A. annulatoides were enriched in repeats and displayed low gene density. Despite differences in AT content, core gene content and Pfam domain profiles remained conserved. These AT-rich isochores exhibit several sequence and structural features consistent with scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs), raising the possibility that they influence higher-order genome organisation. Comparative analyses suggest they arose through independent repeat insertions or via ancestral repeat amplifications. Together, our findings point to a role for AT-rich isochores in shaping genome architecture and potentially mediating stress-responsive regulation, supporting the broader environmental flexibility observed in Hypoxylaceae, including adaptation to dynamic coastal habitats.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Pyruvate supplementation to CF enhanced tubulin and histone acetylation, with the latter promoting MAPK signaling and tubulin detyrosination within PC.

Our results show that all three states contain both shared and unique taxonomic diversity for COI, and that plant DNA was only detected in the membrane bound state. For COI, membrane bound eDNA contained 87.8% of observed ASVs, far exceeding the adsorbed (37.2%) and dissolved (20.5%) states. Only membrane bound eDNA showed evidence of downstream transport, but its extent varied among watersheds due to local hydrology. While upstream eDNA was transported to stream lake confluences, lake surface samples showed marked turnover in community composition. Clarifying the fate of membrane bound eDNA within lakes will enhance catchment level detection from lake samples and understanding of lake hydrodynamics. Of the environmental parameters assessed, water temperature was most strongly aligned with changes in community composition between sites.

Since the vulnerability of genes strongly depends on their size and the abundance of mutation hotspots, we have tested whether negative selection of hypermutable (e.g., CpG bearing) codons could play a role in the evolution of longevity in mammals. Our studies have shown that the CGA codon was significantly more depleted in long-lived than short-lived mammals, suggesting negative selection of this hypermutable stopogenic codon. Interestingly, our analyses have revealed lifespan-dependent changes in codon usage of most amino acids. In the case of a few amino acids (e.g., Ile) the change in codon usage favored translationally optimal codons in long-lived animals, reducing the chances of mistranslation and the formation of abnormal proteins. In the case of a larger group of amino acids (e.g., Tyr, Phe, Asp, Asn), however, the change in codon usage in long-lived animals favored translationally nonoptimal codons that lack matching isodecoder tRNAs. The most likely explanation for this observation is that slowdown of translation at these codons facilitates co-translational folding, thereby reducing the chances of misfolding and aggregation of misfolded proteins in long-lived animals. Our results suggest that the changes in codon usage may contribute significantly to correct co-translational folding, resulting in a more balanced proteostasis and a lower rate of cellular aging in long-lived animals. Our finding is in harmony with the notion that one of the most important hallmarks of aging is loss of proteostasis, manifested in the accumulation of abnormal, misfolded proteins.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We observe avibactam covalently reacted (ring-opened) with the nucleophilic Ser70, at timepoints from 80 ms to minutes (room temperature) and hours (100 K). These crystallographic data reveal time-dependent movement of the avibactam carbamoyl complex, from 1.3 s onwards, that has implications for the 5-exo-trig recyclization mechanism that determines inhibitor reformation. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations at the density functional theory level, the results show that in the first seconds of the reaction the avibactam N-sulfate nitrogen is poorly positioned for recyclization. This subsequently equilibrates after 10 s to a stable endpoint that is in a conformation potentially primed to initiate recyclization through attack of the N-sulfate nitrogen on the carbamoyl carbon.

This approach identified di-heterotetrameric GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 assemblies at the HEK293T cell membrane, whereas GluA1/3 failed to form di-heteromers.

A fundamental challenge inherent to PGT, however, lies in the ultra-low gDNA input (typically <100 pg) from embryo biopsies. To mitigate this limitation, traditional workflows rely on whole genome amplification (WGA) technologies, such as MDA, PicoPlex, and MALBAC. Yet these WGA-based protocols inherently entail pre-amplification of gDNA prior to standard library construction-a step that introduces significant coverage bias and compromised uniformity. These are intrinsic flaws irreparable by downstream library preparation or bioinformatics analysis, ultimately leading to clinical uncertainty in the interpretation of copy number variations (CNVs). In this study, we developed TUPAD (Tn5-Mediated, Uniform Pre-amplification-free and Adapter-Dimer-Free Library preparation), a transformative technology that bypasses the limitations of traditional WGA. By engineering a novel adapter-dimer-free transposon system, TUPAD enables high-efficiency library construction from as little as 1 picogram (pg) of gDNA. This breakthrough allows for a pre-amplification-free workflow, effectively eliminating the primary source of amplification bias. Compared to existing WGA standards, these advantages are fully retained in embryo biopsy and positive sample testing, TUPAD consistently generates highly uniform library data, significantly enhancing the detection limit and accuracy of CNVs and other genomic variants. Beyond these performance advantages, TUPAD also cuts wet-lab processing time by 50%. Practical validation confirms TUPAD results are stable, reliable, with proven practical utility in PGT testing.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

However, quantitative methods to define these constraints and their underlying principles remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce the Structural Semantic Evolutionary Distance (SSED), a metric leveraging the pretrained ESM-3 protein language model to quantify evolutionary divergence within a unified structural semantic space. Our analysis demonstrates that CDGs are subject to persistent structural semantic constraints across species, tolerating a significantly narrower range of structural semantic changes during evolution compared to non-CDGs. Crucially, clinically observed oncogenic mutations follow this same principle, favoring minimal structural perturbation as shaped by long-term gene evolution. Such mutations maintain core protein function while conferring a capacity for immune evasion, thereby driving clonal expansion. Guided by this \"evolutionary constraint\" framework, we successfully predicted and experimentally validated a previously uncharacterized oncogenic mutation, KRAS R135L, in bronchial epithelial cells. Furthermore, clinical cohort analysis demonstrated that SSED acts as an independent predictor of response to immune checkpoint blockade, offering information orthogonal to tumor mutational burden (TMB). This study unifies the evolutionary principles governing CDGs across macroevolutionary and microevolutionary (tumorigenesis) timescales, elucidates the balance between structural adaptability, functional conservation, and immune pressure, and identifies a novel predictive biomarker for cancer immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we analyzed 7,059 Enterobacteriaceae genomes using a phylogenetic birth-death model to quantify gene gain, loss, expansion, and reduction. We reveal that while DEF turnover rates diverge from the background dynamics of their carrying elements, they remain statistically consistent across different genomic environments. Although turnover patterns vary among specific defense families, DEFs generally exhibit a conserved bias toward gain and reduction, regardless of their genomic location. Moreover, anti-defense proteins display accelerated loss, expansion, and reduction rates relative to their cognate defense systems. Variability in turnover rates among defense types is primarily driven by expansion and reduction. We also identified that on prophages, both DEFs and anti-DEFs undergo co-loss with 300 Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COGs). Overall, these results suggest that defense systems possess intrinsic turnover dynamics independent of their genomic environment, and that on prophages, they are often co-spread with their anti-defense proteins on evolutionary timescales.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Recent studies suggest that PKMYT1 inhibition is synthetic lethal in CCNE1-amplified cancers; however, its role in GEA is largely uncharacterized. We investigated the therapeutic activity of PKMYT1 inhibition in CCNE1-amplified GEA and its potential combination with immunotherapy. Experimental Design: We evaluated lunresertib (RP-6306), a selective first-in-class PKMYT1 inhibitor, in CCNE1-amplified and wild-type GEA cell lines to define its effects on cell viability, DNA damage, and gene expression changes. To investigate the role of PKMYT1 blockade on immune microenvironment modulation, we used a syngeneic murine model of CCNE1;Trp53-/- GEA xenografts treated with lunresertib, anti-PD-1, or the combination. Results: Lunresertib was selectively cytotoxic in CCNE1-amplified GEA cell lines in cell viability and clonogenic assays. Mechanistically, treatment with lunresertib induced DNA damage, evidence by increased {gamma}H2AX expression and DNA micronuclei formation, and activated pro-inflammatory signaling pathways by gene set enrichment analysis. In a CCNE1-amplified GEA murine model, PKMYT1 inhibition promoted T cell infiltration, reduced myeloid cells, and synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy to induce tumor regression. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CCNE1 amplification is a potentially actionable target in GEA and support the development of combination therapeutic strategies utilizing PKMYT1 inhibition and PD-1 blockade.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

RPT with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA (Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen) has recently been approved as a life-prolonging treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but its clinical use still relies on non-personalized, empirically chosen fixed schedules. Here, we develop a mechanistic, patient-personalizable mathematical model simulating mCRPC response and organ-at-risk toxicity during [177Lu]Lu-PSMA RPT. The model integrates tumor growth dynamics, radiobiological response, and organ-resolved pharmacokinetics inferred from mass data and standardized uptake values obtained from positron emission tomography studies. Parameters were derived from the literature, although the framework allows personalization by fitting to patient-specific data such as imaging and prostate-specific antigen levels. Using virtual patient (VP) cohorts generated via stochastic parameter sampling, we conducted in silico trials and validated the model by comparing simulated outcomes with published dosimetry and survival data for [177Lu]Lu-PSMA trials. We then explored dosing and scheduling strategies to optimize efficacy-toxicity trade-offs. Consolidated regimens with fewer, higher-activity injections improved overall survival (OS) in silico but increased OAR toxicity, especially in kidneys. Cycle length had a weaker influence on OS within a 2-9 week window, while it clearly affected toxicity, whereas excessive delays (>12 weeks) markedly reduced efficacy. Global sensitivity analysis identified tumor growth, uptake, and radiosensitivity parameters as key drivers of interpatient variability, and convergence testing confirmed robustness with respect to VP cohort size. These methodological findings illustrate how mechanistic modeling and in silico trials can inform the design and personalization of RPT regimens.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We investigated the effects of short-term (until day 5) and long-term (until day 56) post-MI T3 treatment on cardiac function, infarct size, hypertrophy, and gene expression in mice without and with deletion of TR, the main cardiac thyroid hormone receptor (wild-type (WT) and TRKO, respectively) Methods: WT and TRKO mice underwent permanent left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation or sham surgery followed by either short-term T3 for 5 days post-MI or long-term T3 until day 56, including a subgroup in which T3 treatment commenced 14 days post-MI; all groups were followed up for 4 weeks. T3 was delivered via drinking water at 500 ng/ml. Cardiac function was studied with echocardiography (ejection fraction, EF), infarct size by histology (Sirius red), heart weight normalized to tibia length, and transcriptomic profiling (RNA-seq) in WT hearts. Results: Short-term T3 improved EF in WT but not in TRKO mice without induction of hypertrophy or changes in infarct size in either genotype. Long-term T3 induced cardiac hypertrophy in both WT and TRKO mice. However, long-term T3 did not improve EF or reduce infarct size. In TRKO mice, baseline EF post-MI was preserved without T3, but T3 treatment decreased EF. RNA-seq in long-term treated WT mice suggested modulation of Rho-GTPase signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, and immune activation by T3. Conclusions: T3 therapy post-MI improved cardiac function only when applied acutely and for a short term. Long-term exposure led to cardiac hypertrophy without functional improvement and may even worsen cardiac function in TR-deficient settings. Timing, duration, and receptor status are highly relevant for TH-based interventions in MI.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Building on our earlier solution-state analysis of apo MALT1(PCASP - Ig3)339 - 719 which revealed domain flexibility, dynamic autoinhibition, and sensitivity to physiological ionic conditions, we combine NMR relaxation, molecular dynamics simulations, and ensemble modelling to delineate how solution environment reshapes its conformational landscape. Because most structural information derives from dimeric or inhibitor - bound states, the behaviour of monomeric, ligand free MALT1 in physiological solution has remained unclear. Here, MD simulations show that low-salt conditions drive all trajectories toward a unified inactive - like ensemble, marked by inward rotation of W580 and coordinated rearrangements of Loop 2 and Loop 3, indicating that the inactive state is energetically favoured and its reactivation kinetically suppressed. Physiological ionic strength partially restores access to active - like loop motions, aligning with NMR evidence that sodium modulates catalytic readiness. In contrast, high salt conditions rigidify the PCASP - Ig3 module, suppressing loop fluctuations and preventing active - inactive transitions, thereby strongly enriching the active state population. Importantly, the combined MD - NMR analysis demonstrates that the NMR - initiated ensembles provide the most faithful representation of backbone and loop dynamics under low salt conditions, capturing substrate - independent loop rearrangements, stable hydrophobic-core behaviour, and the intrinsic transitions that shape conformational equilibrium of MALT1. Together, these findings identify ionic strength as a key regulator of MALT1 conformational equilibria, highlighting how loop dynamics and domain flexibility tune its proteolytic competence and providing a dynamic framework for future structure-based modulation of MALT1 activity.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

While we reported before a computational study on the Dsup-free DNA interaction (Minguez-Toral et al., Sci. Rep. 2020, 10, 13424), our objective here is to help characterize the interaction of Dsup with nucleosomal DNA. We first address the disordered status of Dsup to prove that it is a completely disordered protein. With a proper 3D model of Dsup and by means of molecular modeling, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and calculations of electrostatic potentials and electric fields, we then present results for several complexes of the human nucleosome with one and two Dsup molecules. Our findings complement and expand upon a recent cryoEM structural study (Alegrio-Louro et al., Genes Dev. 2025, 39, 1-7) which demonstrated that Dsup is recognized through a HMGN-like nucleosome binding motif and resolved the structure for the short 5-residue binding motif of Dsup. In addition to confirming this HMGN-like binding mode, our computational approach reveals dynamic details about the complete 445-residue Dsup in its interaction with the nucleosome. Since our study includes complete histone tails (missing in X-ray and cryoEM structures), it provides a complete picture of distinct possible conformations of Dsup around the nucleosome improving upon low-resolution cryoEM maps available for some Dsup segments. Electrostatic potentials and electric fields reveal in one complex that while the HMGN-like binding motif anchors Dsup at the nucleosome binding site, the conformational freedom of the disordered protein dynamically confers a possible electrostatic protective envelope. This shielding-like effect of Dsup on nucleosomal DNA would thus be similar to that suggested in our previous report on free DNA.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Numerous studies have found that the transcriptome state of microglia can indicate where they lie along this continuum. To understand regulation of microglia transcriptome state, we considered the transcription factor PPAR{delta}, because it is highly expressed in microglia and is a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease, (AD) a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss where microglia dysfunction is involved. When we delineated the microglia transcriptome in mice treated with PPAR{delta} agonist, we noted that PPAR{delta} activation blunted expression of inflammatory mediators and migration-enhancing genes, while boosting phagocytic genes. We then examined PPAR{delta} function in induced transcription factor (iTF) microglia-like cells, and confirmed PPAR{delta} agonism increases phagocyte function while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and migration. To understand PPAR{delta} regulation upon CNS insult, we exposed iTF-microglia to apoptotic neuron debris and defined six microglia transcriptome states as a function of PPAR{delta} activation, and observed PPAR{delta} agonism can shift microglia out of a homeostatic state to a primed, disease-associated microglia-like state. As PPAR{delta} agonism opposed gene expression favored by PU.1, a critical transcription factor in microglial inflammation and AD pathogenesis, we examined their relationship, documented a physical interaction, and found evidence for transrepression. Finally, we tested PPAR{delta} agonism in Huntington's disease and tauopathy mice, and demonstrated PPAR{delta} could decrease neuroinflammation in vivo.

Circadian analysis revealed that middle-aged mice, particularly females, exhibited more precise daily rhythms and shifted a greater proportion of activity and feeding to the lights-on phase compared to young female mice. Middle-aged animals also ran for longer durations per day, suggesting age-related changes in activity regulation. Analysis of infradian rhythms further highlighted sex- and age-specific differences. Young female mice displayed robust 5-day rhythms in wheel-running activity, which were absent in middle-aged females. In contrast, few males (young or middle-aged) showed significant 5-day rhythms. Ten-day rhythms were most prominent in male mice, while females rarely expressed this periodicity. Physiologically, middle-aged mice lost more body weight in response to single housing, with middle-aged females being most affected. Interactions among behavioural rhythms in females also showed greater complexity, which increased with age.

While robotic ultrasound systems with artificial intelligence have emerged to mitigate this, current approaches face critical limitations: they often rely on simulated or phantom data for training, which hampers generalizability, and employ control strategies that lack the flexibility to adapt to complex human anatomy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, end-to-end robotic system for autonomous abdominal scanning. Our methodology is systematic: it begins with coarse scan planning via RGB and 3D point cloud-based localization of key anatomical landmarks (e.g., xiphoid process). The core of our approach involves training a reinforcement learning scanning policy directly on live human volunteers, enabling the development of a strategy that is robust to anatomical diversity. This high-level policy is executed by a sophisticated hybrid force-position controller, enhanced with real-time normal vector calibration and 3D point cloud-based respiratory phase detection to dynamically adjust contact force, particularly during inspiration. This innovation proves critical for improving scan quality in subjects with higher Body Mass Index (BMI). Extensive validation against expert sonographers demonstrates that our system achieves high precision in standard plane recognition and superior scanning efficiency. Furthermore, to holistically assess performance where standard planes are difficult to acquire, we introduce a 3D reconstruction-based coverage metric. Results confirm that our system delivers strong adaptability and significantly improved consistency, marking a substantial step toward clinically viable, operator-independent ultrasound robotics.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Computation of pairwise alignments based on dynamic programming is an important part in many bioinformatics pipelines and a major contributor to overall runtime due to the associated quadratic time complexity. This motivates the need for a library of efficient implementations on modern GPUs for a variety of alignment algorithms for different types of sequence data including DNA, RNA, and proteins. Results: Accelign is a library of accelerated pairwise sequence alignment algo- rithms for CUDA-enabled GPUs. Its parallelization strategy is based on a common wavefront design that can be adapted to support a variety of dynamic programming algorithms: local, global, and semi-global alignment of genomic and protein sequences with a variety of commonly used scoring schemes supporting one-to-one, one-to-many or all-to-all pairwise sequence alignments. This leads to a peak performance between 16.1 TCUPS and 9.1 TCUPS for computing optimal global alignment scores with linear gaps and affine gap penalties on a single RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU, respectively. In addition, our library demonstrates sig- nificant speedups in several real-world case studies over prior CPU-based (SeqAn, Parasail, BSalign) and GPU-based libraries (ADEPT, GASAL2), and can even outperform highly customized algorithms (WFA-GPU, CUDASW++4.0).

We present an explainable AL framework built on Gaussian process regression and assess how molecular representations, covariance kernels, and acquisition policies affect enrichment across four drug-relevant targets. Using recall of top active compounds, we find that dataset identity the target's chemical landscape sets the performance ceiling, while method choices modulate outcomes rather than overturn them. Fingerprints with simple Gaussian process kernels provide robust, low-variance enrichment, whereas learned embeddings with nonlinear kernels can reach higher peaks but with greater variability. Uncertainty-guided acquisition consistently outperforms random selection, yet no single policy is universally optimal; the best choice follows structure-activity relationship (SAR) complexity. To enhance interpretability beyond blackbox selection, we integrate SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to link high-impact fingerprint bits to chemically meaningful fragments across AL cycles, illustrating how the model's attention progressively concentrates on SAR-relevant motifs.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Reducing variant allele frequency (VAF) is an important treatment goal, but no current treatment modalities fully and specifically inhibit mutant signalling. Thus, the consequences of V617F inactivation are unclear, including whether selective inhibition of V617F signalling will eradicate mutant cells due to oncogene addiction. Here, we describe an allele-selective CRISPR-Cas genome editing strategy that achieves selective and efficient JAK2 V617F inactivation in patient stem and progenitor cells. We show that JAK2 V617F heterozygous cells are not oncogene addicted and maintain viability and differentiation potential upon loss of their mutant allele. In contrast, homozygous mutant cells are eradicated upon deletion of both mutant alleles. Across in vitro, organoid, xenotransplantation and single-cell assays, selective deletion of V617F alleles reverts MPN hallmarks including erythroid clonogenicity, inflammatory gene expression signatures, as well as myelofibrosis and splenomegaly phenotypes in an in vivo xenograft model. Collectively, our results show that is it possible to revert heterozygous JAK2 V617F mutant cells to a normal phenotype and suggest that ex vivo genome editing of stem and progenitor cells may be a viable treatment option to achieve rapid and deep reductions in VAF.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

E.; Rangamani, P.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscle displays remarkable plasticity, adapting its size and strength in response to mechanical loading, particularly, from exercise. This process, known as hypertrophy, is fundamental to athletic training and rehabilitation, but is challenging to quantitatively predict due to its multifactorial, multiscale nature. Specifically, skeletal muscle hypertrophy results from an integration of macroscopic mechanical stimuli with the intracellular signaling pathways that govern muscle growth. In this work, we present a multiscale computational model that mechanistically integrates these mechanical and biochemical stimuli and offers a framework for predicting the outcomes of different types of exercise on skeletal muscle growth. The framework couples a transversely isotropic hyperelastic model for tissue-level mechanics with a system of ordinary differential equations representing the IGF1-AKT-mTOR-FOXO signaling pathway, a key regulator of protein synthesis and degradation. We link these scales using a volumetric growth model, where the signaling dynamics inform a growth tensor that drives changes in muscle cross-sectional area. This approach enables the simulation of long-term muscle adaptation, providing a mechanistic tool to investigate how different exercise protocols lead to macroscopic hypertrophy. Simulations from our model capture the temporal dynamics of hypertrophy under varying load protocols and highlight how feedback between protein synthesis and muscle growth regulates the dose-response relationship to prevent unbounded growth. Using muscle geometries derived from the Visible Human dataset, we study how human variations in muscle geometry affect hypertrophy. Finally, we demonstrate that the mechanochemical coupling between muscle geometry and signaling not only predicts macroscopic shape changes but also provides buffering from local signaling heterogeneity. Ultimately, this framework offers a predictive computational tool for optimizing training regimens and understanding the multiscale determinants of muscle adaptations.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Building on recent advances in deep learning and large-scale data, here we developed an EMG foundation model for neural decoding. Our model was trained on more than 197 hours of neural recordings from 1,667 subjects. We used unsupervised learning to pretrain our encoder layers on unlabeled data, followed by supervised learning on our benchmark dataset. Additionally, we performed large-scale architecture searches to develop a custom encoder-decoder model composed of convolutional and transformer layers, optimized for both scalability and performance. Our foundation model consistently outperformed the previous state-of-the-art (i.e., subject-optimized models) across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluations. For in-distribution evaluation, few-shot fine-tuning yielded an average F1 score of 0.697, compared to 0.638 for subject-optimized models. For out-of-distribution evaluation on clinical and demographically-shifted subjects, we achieved an average F1 score of 0.599, compared to 0.518 for the subject-optimized baselines.

Here, we examined relationships between eye fixations, memory precision and fMRI BOLD activity. At study, participants were presented with object images, each placed at a random location on an invisible circle. At test, both studied and new images were presented. Participants were instructed to make a covert recognition memory judgment to each image, recall and then signal its studied location, guessing if necessary. Simultaneous fMRI and eye-tracking data were acquired during the test phase. For correctly recognized images, the trial-wise angular distance between the studied and reported locations was fitted to a two-component mixture model. Based on the model-derived parameters, correctly recognized images were categorized as those associated with successful location retrieval (location hits) or guesses. Location hits were further divided into high- and low precision trials. At retrieval, fixations predicted both successful retrieval and the precision of the retrieved location memory. Additionally, across-trial fixation patterns were more similar for location hits than for guesses, and for high- than for low-precision trials. The association between retrieval success and eye fixation precision was evident across almost the entire recall phase, whereas memory precision effects emerged around 1-1.5s after image onset. Fixation precision and fixation pattern similarity each predicted trial-wise memory precision independently of hippocampal BOLD activity, which also predicted precision. These findings suggest that eye fixations during retrieval track the fidelity of mnemonic content.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

A.; Jankovic, D.; Cameron-Pack, M.; MacDonald, R.

In the retina, Muller glia (MG) serve as the principal support cells, performing roles analogous to astrocytes in the brain. As late-born retinal cells, MG undergo morphogenesis within a complex extracellular milieu composed of neighbouring neurons, synapses, and ECM components. Using the zebrafish retina, we show that developing MG dynamically interact with the ECM across all retinal layers while expressing the ECM-remodelling enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp) 2 and 9. Although Mmps are known to contribute to tissue remodelling and disease processes such as glioma invasion, their developmental roles in glia remain less defined. Here, we demonstrate that Mmp2 and Mmp9 are required for MG morphogenesis and glia-neuron integration. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic loss of mmp2 and mmp9 impaired MG outgrowth and reduced process complexity within synaptic layers, leading to decreased MG-synapse associations. Double mutants (mmp2-/-;mmp9-/-) displayed normal neuronal development and visual function at larval stages but exhibited gliosis, premature neurodegeneration, and visual deficits in adulthood. Together, these findings reveal that Mmp2 and Mmp9 are critical for establishing MG-synapse interactions during development and for maintaining neuronal integrity and visual function in the mature retina.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Our observations revealed a reduction in mitophagy levels in both cell types during aging, and we consistently found a higher level of mitophagy in astrocytes compared to neurons across both age groups, indicating a cell type-specific mitophagy dynamics that is independently of the aging process. NAD+ augmentation improved mitophagy level in both neurons and astrocytes in old-aged mice at the dose and method of administration tested.

Lineage tracing identified that best4+ cells arise from atoh1b+ secretory progenitors. We identify that Notch signaling, mediated by dll4, specifies best4+ cells at the expense of enterochromaffin cells. Downstream of Notch, meis1b confers best4+ cell identity. best4+ cells then exhibit regionalized gene expression, regulated by pbx3a. Additionally, this study demonstrates a system where best4+ cells can be manipulated, observed, and removed in an organismal context. Live imaging and electron microscopy of best4+ cells identified dynamic cellular projections, suggesting a sensory or communicative function. Removal of best4+ cells in vivo eliminated previously proposed functions: they are not required to restore intestinal pH following acidic challenge and do not absorb nutrients. However, we identify region-specific intracellular pH differences that suggest potential functional heterogeneity. Altogether, this study presents a comprehensive description of best4+ cell development from birth to spatial regulation that will be instrumental to understand how best4+ cells change in disease or might be therapeutically manipulated and presents the tools to dissect their function in vivo.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Resource supplementation had diverse impacts on 12 parasite taxa including positive (3/12), negative (6/12), and null (3/12) results. Supplementation also influenced host biology, with supplemented mice moving less, experiencing higher conspecific densities, improved conditions, and increased reproduction.

Using Natural History collections, we study the genetic basis and evolution of white/brown winter coat color variation in the long-tailed weasel (Neogale frenata), a crucial phenological adaptation for camouflage in habitats with seasonal snow. We produced whole-genome sequencing data for museum specimens, along two winter color morph transition areas in North America, at the West and East coasts. Genome-wide association scans identified a single genomic region linked to color variation polymorphism with approximately 300kb and 200kb in the West and East regions, respectively, which included the pigmentation gene MC1R. We identified three MC1R alleles, two of which with deletions of nine or eight amino acids, alternatively associated with the winter brown morphs in the West and East, respectively. These deletions affect the second transmembrane domain, and in one case also the first extracellular loop, which in silico analyses predicted to impact the protein's function. Our findings show alternative intraspecific evolutionary solutions for environmental adaptation in long-tailed weasels, building on the evidence that major genes of the melanin production pathway are hotspots for recurrent and independent evolution of winter camouflage adaptation.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Theoretically, these three host strategies have very different epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes. In particular, because mortality tolerance increases parasite population size, it is under strong positive frequency-dependent selection and may therefore be less variable between populations than either resistance or fecundity tolerance. Additionally, host investment in each strategy can be expected to differ between populations that experience different ecological conditions. Here, we tested how populations of Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata from the upper and lower courses of three rivers responded to experimental infection with a novel strain of Gyrodactylus turnbulli. In line with theoretical predictions, we found that lower course populations, previously shown to have faster paces of life, invested less in resistance and fecundity tolerance - but not mortality tolerance - than the upper course populations with slower paces of life. Our results indicate that this host-parasite interaction both conforms to evolutionary-epidemiological theoretical predictions, and is shaped by broader ecological conditions.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Any change in the system whether through mutations in the protein or DNA, external factors, or protein conformational transitions can alter this interaction network, thereby affecting structural and functional aspects. Employing all-atom classical molecular dynamics, we investigated how the interaction network in the ZTA TF-DNA is rewired when key arginine residues in ZTA are mutated to oppositely charged glutamic acids. Using the MMPBSA technique, we calculated per-residue binding energies for all systems and correlated binding affinity with structural features. Our detailed mechanistic study shows that when key arginine residues are mutated, new interactions are formed either around the mutation site and/or in other ZTA monomer. Through load sharing, the system attempts to counter-balance the interaction load, leading to reorganization of the interaction network. As the number of mutations increases from single-to-double site, the system is able to partially maintain its structural stability. However, with multi-site mutations, even after reorganization of the interaction network, system cannot sustain its structural stability and therefore becomes destabilized. Despite the structural symmetry of the ZTA TF, we observed asymmetric monomer contributions upon mutation. Overall, our rigorous mechanistic studies provide deeper insights into the mechanism of interaction network reorganization in ZTA-DNA system. These comprehensive insights may be useful for tuning binding affinity and structural adaptability under adverse conditions. Since ZTA is a key factor in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), this study will be central to understanding DNA recognition and developing drug therapeutics targeting viral transcription factors in EBV.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

TACO1 binds the mitoribosomal region typically bound by elongation factor Tu (mtEF-Tu), bridging the large and small subunits via contacts with 16S rRNA, bL12m, A-site tRNA, and uS12m. While active throughout elongation, TACO1 is especially critical when translating polyproline motifs. Its absence prolongs mtEF-Tu residence in A/T states, causes persistent mitoribosomal stalling and premature subunit dissociation. Structural analyses indicate that TACO1 competes with mtEF-Tu for mitoribosome binding, stabilizes A-site tRNA, and enhances peptidyl transfer through a mechanism distinct from EF-P and eIF5A.

A key challenge is understanding how these tissues store a memory of past mechanical stimuli. Here, we investigate this memory using an active Vertex Model of epithelial sheets incorporating a local, mechanosensitive tension-remodeling rule where junctional tension updates depend on strain, acting as a slow, history-dependent variable. We demonstrate three hallmark mechanical consequences of this memory mechanism. First, a localized, short contractile cue permanently reprograms the global shear modulus, with the direction of change (stiffening or softening) controlled by the tension remodeling rate. Second, the tissue stores a long-range mechanical memory: a prior stimulus at one site modulates the tissue's response to a subsequent, distant stimulus, mediated by coupling across the entire junctional network. Finally, we show that simple cyclic bulk deformation acts as a training protocol that autonomously tunes the tissue's constitutive properties, including programming the Poisson ratio to auxetic (negative) values.

Despite advancements in anti-angiogenic cancer therapies, such as bevacizumab, late-stage tumors, including advanced melanomas, exhibit mixed clinical responses. In this study, we elucidate a unique role for melanoma-derived L-EVs in promoting bevacizumab-insensitive endothelial angiogenic phenotypes. This L-EV-mediated increase in endothelial tube formation is sensitive to the effects of sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, but not SU5416, a selective VEGF-receptor inhibitor. We also demonstrate that melanoma L-EVs contain VEGF as luminal cargo and induce paracrine effects by modulating the endothelial EV secretome. The release from endothelial cells of soluble VEGF, EVs, and pro-angiogenic cytokines such as IL-8, MIF, and PAI-1 drive sustained endothelial tube formation through autocrine signaling.

Bioinformatic analysis using LncLOOM revealed conserved motifs across primates and mice, including predicted binding sites for miR-18a-5p, miR-196-5p, miR-1306-5p, and miR-423-3p. To define PACER's structural organization, we performed selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP), generating the first secondary structure determination of PACER. SHAPE-MaP and SuperFold analyses revealed a compact, stabilized 5' domain and a flexible central and 3' region. {Delta}SHAPE analysis identified multiple sites of differential protection, and Rsample clustering resolved two dominant in vivo conformations, suggesting that PACER adopts a modular architecture with defined structural domains. These structured regions coincide with conserved motifs associated with NF-{kappa}B p50 and predicted miRNA binding sites, indicating that PACER function may depend on conformational switching that modulates protein and miRNA accessibility. Together, these findings establish PACER as a regulator of LUAD proliferation and invasion via COX-2 signaling and highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in inflammatory cancers.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

With treatment for severe AS limited to valve replacement and no effective pharmacotherapies, new interventions are urgently needed for patients. This study evaluated pemafibrate, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa) activator as a novel therapeutic for CAVD and AS. METHODS AND RESULTS In an aortic valve wire injury (AVWI) model of AS in Ldlr-/- mice, pemafibrate administration (0.2 mg/kg/day) for 15 weeks improved aortic valve function and reduced valvular calcification by 39% (p<0.001), accompanied by reduced leaflet inflammation and CD68+; macrophage infiltration. These effects were independent of changes in plasma triglyceride levels. In vitro, pemafibrate suppressed inflammation-mediated calcification of primary human valvular interstitial cells (VICs) by modulating macrophage-derived secreted factors, identifying macrophage-VIC crosstalk as a key disease mechanism. Direct treatment of macrophages with pemafibrate, or exposure to serum from pemafibrate-treated participants in the PROMINENT randomized controlled trial, shifted macrophages toward a less inflammatory and less chemotactic phenotype. Proteomic analyses of patient serum substantiated these findings by reflecting a systemic reduction in inflammatory parameters and monocyte activation. Network integration of the in vitro derived pemafibrate-responsive proteome with human calcified AV tissue proteomes identified aberrant protein translation (GNB2L1, GSPT1) and disrupted bioenergetics (MYDGF, PDIA4) as potential clinically relevant pemafibrate-responsive pathways and effector proteins relevant to AS progression. CONCLUSIONS Pemafibrate slows experimental AS progression and valve calcification through modulation of macrophage-VIC crosstalk, independent of lipid lowering. These findings support further evaluation of pemafibrate as a potential pharmacological approach for CAVD and support further testing in randomized clinical trials.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, bacteria capable of producing SPSs are limited. In contrast, many cyanobacteria synthesize diverse SPSs, making them promising hosts to produce valuable SPSs, sources for novel SPSs, and genetic resources for SPS biosynthesis. However, no study has introduced an entire heterologous SPS biosynthetic system into cyanobacteria to produce a heterologous SPS. We recently identified a novel SPS, synechan, and elucidated the genetic basis for the biosynthesis and regulation of cyanobacterial SPSs. Here, we heterologously expressed the gene set responsible for synechan biosynthesis and its regulation in the non-SPS-producing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and successfully induced the production of an SPS. This work provides a foundation for engineering cyanobacteria to produce useful SPSs and, to our knowledge, the first functional heterologous reconstitution in cyanobacteria of a large gene cluster encoding a complex membrane-associated biosynthetic system and thus an important step in synthetic-biology-based engineering of cyanobacteria.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

However, its application remains hindered by synthesis costs, limited sequence length and poor scalability. DNA polymerase is a critical enzymatic tool in the DNA storage systems by enabling high-fidelity data writing and targeted sequence amplification. In this study, we engineered chimeric DNA polymerases by fusing the high-fidelity 9{degrees}N DNA polymerase with double-stranded DNA binding proteins derived from thermophilic archaea. These fusions significantly enhanced processivity, thermal stability, and salt tolerance by stabilizing enzyme-template interactions, mimicking sliding clamps while preserving catalytic efficiency. Leveraging these properties, we demonstrated precise file retrieval from a mixed oligonucleotide pool using orthogonal barcode primers. Compared with wild-type 9{degrees}N, the chimeric polymerases, particularly PLS, exhibited reduced substitution error rates and improved read accuracy. We then applied these enzymes to a DNA movable type storage system, where prefabricated DNA modules were assembled into encoding blocks. Using engineered polymerases, these blocks were recombined to enable flexible data rewriting without de novo DNA synthesis. Moreover, a multi-enzyme assembly strategy enabled the construction of kilobase-scale DNA sequences encoding a classical Chinese poem, achieving complete data recovery. All assembled fragments remained stable in E. coli over 100 generations, exhibiting the potential for in vivo storage.

These trap spaces and their succession diagram can be efficiently identified, and constitute a dramatic reduction compared to the full state space. The SD Markov chain preserves the decisions that trap the system's dynamics while making the state space computationally tractable. Using an ensemble of random Boolean networks with known state transition matrices, we show that the SD Markov chain accurately reproduces attractors, basins of attraction, convergence probabilities, decision transitions, and sequences of events. By combining the interpretability of the succession diagram with the probabilistic rigor of Markov analysis, the SD Markov chain offers a compact quantitative description of the attractor landscape and provides a new avenue for studying control and stability in complex biological systems.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

P.; Jolly, M. K.", "abstract": "Cancer cell adaptation to their physical tumor microenvironment is a key driver of malignancy. Recent experimental evolution experiments show that the soft extracellular matrix (ECM) can impose a selection pressure on genetically variable tumor populations. Over months of sustained culture, the selection pressure leads to enrichment of specific genetic variants with high fitness, but the mechanisms underlying the high fitness of these soft-selected clones are not fully understood. Here, we used a combination of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and RRBS-seq to compare soft-selected populations with non-selected ancestral populations cultured on soft ECM. We demonstrate that ancestral populations grown on soft ECM for short durations are characterized by a stressed cell state with low fitness marked by cell cycle arrest and distinct metabolic shifts, whereas sustained culture selects for a robust proliferative phenotype. Mechanistically, selected cells exhibit a silenced ancestral stress response through epigenetic modifications, characterized by reduced chromatin accessibility and de novo DNA methylation, including CDH1 promoter hypermethylation. This repressive landscape supports a high-fitness state defined by elevated MYBL2 and FAK levels. An in-silico mechanism-based model shows that these molecular differences, together with high YAP1 nuclear localization in soft-selected cells, are salient features of genetic clones capable of FAK upregulation. These findings uncover a coordinated genetic and epigenetic mechanism driving cancer cell evolution in mechanically soft microenvironments.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

This work systematically compares major analytical approaches for MC and mCov to clarify their assumptions, dependencies, and interpretational boundaries with the most used radiotracer [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose to obtain metabolic connectivity (M-MC). Twenty healthy participants underwent ultra-high-sensitivity fPET acquisitions on a large axial field-of-view scanner.

Results demonstrate that while all MC methods are valid, CompCor and Euclidean distance perform optimally at high temporal resolutions (1-16s), whereas polynomial and spatio-temporal filters are more robust at lower sampling rates (>16s). mCov offers a population-level characterization of metabolic organization with the option to derive relative-to-group single-subject maps.

Animal models of TLE reveal impairments in spatial firing fields of hippocampal place cells, providing a potential neural substrate for memory problems. Each subfield of the hippocampus carries out unique aspects of spatial memory, yet little is known about how individual subfields are perturbed. Here, we investigated the spatial coding properties of the three major subfields of the hippocampus. Single unit recordings were made from CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG) of mice induced with epilepsy (N = 10, 6M/4F) using the supra-hippocampal kainate model and in control mice injected with saline (N = 6, 3M/3F). Place cell activity was measured while mice foraged in highly familiar environments to assess basic place cell properties and in novel environments to assess remapping. A lower percentage of cells were classified as place cells in CA1 of epileptic mice, whereas percentages were similar in CA3 and DG compared to control. Place fields of CA1 and CA3 cells were less coherent, while DG fields were less stable. All regions constructed new distinct maps within the first session of exposure to a novel environment, however new maps in CA3 were not stable. These results point to specific deficits within subfields of the hippocampus, which may indicate that there are different cellular and network mechanisms at play. Such heterogeneity would be predicted to contribute differently to memory deficits and suggests that interventions for treatment may need to be tailored.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

It is characterized by the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes causing cell death followed by stromal cell activation and scar deposition at later disease stages. While a marked accumulation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells is observed in MASH in humans and mice, the role of adaptive immune cells in fibrosis progression remains debated. Methods: Transcriptional data were curated from human datasets and preclinical mouse models, including mice deficient in TCR{beta} T cells (Tcrb-/-), which lack conventional CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic T cells, in diet-induced fibrosing MASH for single-cell RNA-sequencing. Specific human and mouse liver transcriptomic immune signatures were corroborated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Results: MASH was associated with the expansion of lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Auto-aggressive CXCR6+PD1+FASLG+ CD8 T cells were enriched in livers of high-fat-diet-fed mice and correlated with MASH and fibrosis. Notably, Tcrb-deficient mice in a chemical and dietary preclinical MASH model developed fibrosis to the same extent as wild-type mice and exhibited exacerbated pro-fibrotic type 3 inflammation. Loss of conventional CD8 T cells neither impacted myeloid cell number nor phenotype within the fibrotic niche. Neutrophil- and non-conventional lymphocyte-derived GM-CSF and IL-17A were central drivers in the fibrotic niche composed of pathogenic macrophages and activated myofibroblasts. Furthermore, myeloid cells were identified as the main source of CXCL16 in diseased livers, retaining auto-aggressive CD8 T cells to the scar and contributing to their accumulation. Thus, non-adaptive cells, including scar-associated macrophages (SAMs) and myofibroblasts, are sufficient for MASH-driven fibrosis in this model.

Recipients of inactivated vaccines readily develop Omicron-specific antibodies through repeated breakthrough infections, whereas mRNA-vaccinated individuals exhibit severe ancestral-strain imprinting that suppresses de novo Omicron-specific responses. These differences could result in distinct antibody landscapes, leading to regional epidemiological divergence and necessitating region-specific vaccine update strategies. Importantly, conventional wild type mouse models fail to recapitulate strong human SARS-CoV-2 imprinting, which significantly hinders imprinting-related mechanistic investigation and vaccine update evaluation. Here, we surprisingly found that V(D)J-humanized mice could faithfully recapitulate human severe SARS-CoV-2 immune imprinting phenotypes. Comprehensive antibody repertoire and epitope mapping of 583 monoclonal antibodies from these models revealed that the abundance of pre-existing IGHV3-53/66-encoded SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses determines imprinting severity following Omicron exposure through antibody-mediated masking of Omicron-specific epitopes. Both passive transfer of IGHV3-53/66 antibodies and knock-in of the human IGHV3-53 gene were sufficient to induce severe SARS-CoV-2 imprinting in wild-type mice. Concordantly, head-to-head comparison also showed that mRNA vaccine recipients retained higher IGHV3-53/66 antibody abundance and thus stronger imprinting than inactivated vaccine recipients. Consequently, compared to NB.1.8.1, XFG exhibits greater immune evasion in mRNA-vaccinated individuals but not in inactivated vaccine recipients. This explains the regional predominance of XFG in mRNA-vaccinated populations, while NB.1.8.1 prevails in inactivated vaccine-dominated countries. Together, these findings demonstrate that the V(D)J germline repertoire-even a single germline-encoded antibody response-can profoundly shape humoral imprinting severity. Accordingly, we constructed a human IGHV3-53 knock-in mouse model that can accurately recapitulate human SARS-CoV-2 antibody landscape, providing a valuable tool for guiding future COVID-19 vaccine updates.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We demonstrated that skatole degradation was a broadly conserved trait across diverse Rhodococcus species, including R. aetherivorans, R. pyridinivorans, R. ruber and R. qingshengii. Genomic and functional analyses uncovered a novel flavoprotein monooxygenase (FPMO) SkaA as the initial catalyst for skatole catabolism. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli confirmed SkaA's essential catalytic role, with high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identifying the key product 3-methyloxindole and 3-hydroxy-3-methyloxindole. Distribution studies revealed SkaA homologs predominantly in Actinobacteria, particularly Nocardia and Rhodococcus, indicating conserved metabolic capacity for skatole transformation within this phylum.

Although EBV toggles between latent and lytic states, the host cues that control this switch remain incompletely defined. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A; hereafter IL-17), a signature Th17 cytokine, is abundant in EBV-associated tissues, and EBV products can augment IL-17 responses. Whether IL-17 directly modulates the EBV life cycle has remained unknown. Here we show that IL-17 alone is sufficient to induce EBV lytic reactivation in latently infected human B cells. Across RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and RNA-seq, IL-17 increased the immediate-early regulator BZLF1 (Zta) and upregulated downstream early and late viral genes, consistent with activation of a transcriptome-wide lytic program. Culture supernatants from IL-17-treated cells contained elevated DNase-resistant extracellular EBV DNA, indicating productive replication with encapsidated genomes. Transcriptomic pathway analyses confirmed engagement of IL-17-linked signaling and highlighted inflammatory modules, including NF-{kappa}B and JAK-STAT. Gene Ontology analysis further enriched for regulation of B-cell receptor signaling and B-cell activation, situating IL-17 within B-cell inflammatory circuitry. Together, these findings identify IL-17 as a cytokine cue for EBV lytic entry and provide a mechanistic link between Th17-skewed inflammation and episodic EBV reactivation. This cytokine-driven pathway complements existing models centered on B-cell receptor signaling, hypoxia/HIF-1, COX-2/PGE2, and TGF-{beta} and motivates testing whether modulation of the IL-17/IL-17R axis can alter EBV reactivation in IL-17-rich settings.

Thriving across this spectrum requires the capacity to dynamically rewire core metabolic pathways in response to fluctuating oxygen levels. Yet, despite the central role of oxygen in shaping fungal metabolism and fitness, the genetic basis underlying hypoxic adaptation in C. albicans remains incompletely understood. Here, we performed a genetic screen to identify genes required for adaptation to hypoxia (5% O2). This comprehensive approach revealed numerous genes spanning diverse metabolic and stress-related functions that are essential for optimal growth under oxygen-limiting conditions. Notably, this study uncovers a previously unrecognized role for the TOR (Target of Rapamycin) signaling pathway and the chromatin-remodeling complex Ino80 in orchestrating the fungal adaptive response to hypoxia. Integration of ino80 mutant transcriptomic data with Ino80 DNA-binding and nucleosome-occupancy profiles under conditional INO80 depletion revealed that this chromatin remodeler regulates the cellular phosphate demand associated with hypoxic exposure. The similarity between chromatin accessibility changes following TOR1 and INO80 depletion further suggests that Ino80 acts in concert with the TOR pathway to support growth and maintain phosphate homeostasis under low-oxygen conditions.

Here, we investigated the coevolutionary dynamics between Klebsiella pneumoniae and a phage cocktail with complementary host tropisms: a capsule-dependent phage and an acapsular-targeting phage, coevolved with bacteria either individually or in combination. The coevolutionary phage training demonstrated that evolution of the acapsular-targeting phage was the main driver of the enhanced resistance delay observed.

These effects are conserved across neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Integrating proteomics, phosphoproteomics, kinase perturbation assays, and candidates emerging from our prior genome-wide CRISPR screen, we further uncover contributions from temperature-sensitive CDC2-like kinase signalling and the RNA helicase DDX5, a known rG4 resolver and an hnRNPH1/hnRNPF co-factor. Together, our findings establish rG4 remodelling as the dominant driver of hnRNPH1-dependent RBM3 splicing, while implicating helicase activity and kinase signalling as modulatory layers that fine-tune this response. More broadly, this work illustrates how environmentally driven RNA structural transitions interface with enzymatic regulators to achieve temperature-responsive control of alternative splicing.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

The majority of miRNA sensors use protein degradation to measure miRNA activities. Here we report miRNA sensors that use fluorescent protein synthesis rather than degradation to measure miRNA activity. Specifically, miR-16-1-3p and miR-16-2-3p sensors consist of the bidirectional tet-On system driving the expression of the Katusha2S protein that is regulated by the RNA interference and GFP as a reference. These sensors specifically detect mir16-1-3p and mir16-2-3p small RNA mimics in the osteosarcoma cell line after doxycycline induction. Kinetic measurements of the reporter responses to the miRNA mimics revealed that pre-induced sensors reach significant differences from the control faster, within 2h than the sensors that were induced after mimic transfection.

During placodal invagination, the OP also produces several classes of migratory neurons such as, gonadotropin-releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons, terminal nerve (TN) neurons, and olfactory pioneer neurons, the latter of which are thought to play a key role in initiating olfactory bulb development. Despite decades of research, the genetic lineage and molecular identity of the various neuronal types that arise from the OP remain under investigation. The GnRH-1 neurons play essential roles in reproduction as well as chemodetection; however, they appear to have a distinct genetic lineage from olfactory and vomeronasal chemosensory neurons. The Golgi-associated olfactory signaling regulator (Goofy/Gfy) is known to be expressed in developing chemosensory neurons. To determine whether the expression of this gene is specific to the neurons of the nasal chemosensory epithelia or a common feature of OP derivatives, we characterized its expression and lineage at both embryonic and postnatal stages. Our results confirm broad expression across developing chemosensory neurons and by subsets of olfactory pioneer neurons. However, our data show that the GnRH-1 neurons do not express Gfy and suggest only sparse expression across the putative TN neurons.

While genomic studies have shown that gene family expansion and functional recruitment underlie key carnivorous traits, the effects of these transitions on rates of sequence evolution remain incompletely understood. Here, we present a comparative framework to examine evolutionary rate shifts across 30 carnivorous and non-carnivorous eudicots in over 12,000 gene families. Analyzing branch-lengths and evolutionary rate covariation (ERC), we detect both lineage-specific and convergent acceleration in CPs for genes associated with stress response, stimulus signaling, and light perception. Accelerated genes often belong to expanded families and show relaxation of purifying selection pressure. Despite the limited number of specific genes or gene families showing convergent acceleration across CP lineages, we find strong convergence at the functional level. Distinct sets of accelerated genes in each CP lineage are enriched for similar functional pathways, particularly light and hormone responses. ERC network analysis identifies a stress- and stimulus-responsive gene community with lineage-specific acceleration in Sarraceniaceae species and moderate acceleration in other CP lineages. Hub genes in this network are also co-expressed in a distantly related non-CP model system, suggesting repeated co-option of an ancestral regulatory module for carnivorous functions. Together, our results show that convergent genomic rate accelerations in CPs primarily involve functionally equivalent or similar but lineage-distinct genes, shaped by gene duplication, relaxed selection, and co-option of stress-response networks.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

F.; Seistrup, A.-S.; Nischwitz, E.; Butter, F.", "abstract": "Gene regulation via Argonaute-bound small RNAs is a broadly conserved mechanism, present in all domains of life. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans expresses several worm-specific Argonautes (WAGOs), which interact with the small RNAs known as 22G-RNAs. These WAGOs have roles in gene regulation, transposon-defence as well as in viral control and experimentally induced RNA interference. Despite many studies, direct relationships between WAGO targeting, as defined by 22G RNA sequences, and mRNA abundance are not clear. Also, the effects of developmental stage and WAGO-interconnectivity have been under-studied thus far. We studied these aspects for two germline-expressed WAGO proteins, WAGO-1 and WAGO-3. We show that WAGO-1 mostly affects 22G-RNA expression in gravid adult worms, while WAGO-3 predominantly affects 22G-RNA expression in embryos. Furthermore, we detect a link between WAGO-3 and the maternal 26G-RNA pathway governed by the Argonaute protein ERGO-1, and between WAGO-1 and the paternal 26G-RNA pathway governed by the Argonautes ALG-3/4. We also demonstrate that, globally speaking, loss of WAGO-1 or WAGO-3 does not result in upregulation of their target mRNAs, as defined by 22G-RNA complementarity. Finally, metagene analysis of 22G-RNA profiles suggests loss of one WAGO protein leads to shifts in WAGO 22G-RNA binding. Overall, we conclude that WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 are developmentally dynamic, are embedded in distinct regulatory networks, and that potential silencing of individual mRNAs by these WAGO proteins is hard to assess by simple loss-of-function studies.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Herein, we use protein total- and semi-synthesis to probe the contribution of C stereochemistry to LCD self-association with synthetic Chiral Inversion Mutagenesis (ChIM).

The microdevice integrates deformable elastomeric channels with magnetic bead stacking to immobilize and concentrate AgNCs within confined nanoscopic junctions, thereby generating densely packed plasmonic hot-spot architectures that markedly enhance Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) efficiency. Time-resolved measurements revealed substantial increases in Raman intensity for both 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) and 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP), outperforming corresponding off-chip assays and maintaining stable enhancement factors over a four-hour operational window.

Using threading and generative algorithms such as AlphaFold and ColabFold, large cohorts of WXS information can be converted into computationally analyzable structures.

We applied TRIO-AI to single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse liver ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury across multiple timepoints (days 0, 1, 3, and 5 post-injury), comprehensively characterizing major hepatic macrophage populations. TRIO-AI identified a distinct transitional macrophage population (MPs_3) that peaks at 48 hours post-injury and exhibits coordinated signatures for lipid handling (LRP1, LRP6, ABCA1, LDLR, SCARB1), efferocytosis (MARCO, MERTK, MSR1), and extracellular matrix engagement (ITGA9, ITGB1, SDC2). This population serves as a critical integrator of multicellular pro-reparative signals through APOE-LRP1 and FN1-ITGA9 signaling axes. Spatial transcriptomics validation confirmed MPs_3 localization to peri-necrotic borders with dramatic enrichment of APOE-LRP1 co-localization at 48 hours (19 pairs) compared to 24 hours (3 pairs).

Using Fe(II) iminopyridine complexes, we generated chemically defined multivalent glycan displays where the valency, arm length, and spatial display of mannose residues can be controlled via subcomponent self-assembly. Due to its sensitivity towards the geometric display of mannose residues, monomeric Griffithsin (mGRFT) was utilized as a model lectin.

Most PD-causing LRRK2 mutations increase the kinase activity, leading to abnormal phosphorylation of Rab GTPases, disrupting vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and autophagy. When expressed in cells, LRRK2 is distributed throughout the cytosol. However, exogenously expressed LRRK2 can form microtubule-associated filaments that have been shown to affect molecular transport along microtubules in vitro. While LRRK2's association with microtubules has not been detected at endogenous levels, inhibitors being designed and tested as therapeutics have been shown to either promote or prevent filament formation of LRRK2. In this study, we examine the localization and resulting molecular organization of hyperactive LRRK2-I2020T, a common PD mutant, in cells treated with type I (MLi-2) or type II (GZD-824) kinase inhibitors. Treatment with a type I kinase inhibitor results in extensive LRRK2-I2020T decoration around microtubules and microtubule bundling. Stabilization of LRRK2-I2020T filaments by type I inhibitor treatment allowed us to determine the full-length kinase active structure of LRRK2-I2020T in its native cellular environment. Conversely, treatment with a type II inhibitor resulted in minimal microtubule decoration by LRRK2-I2020T compared to Type I inhibitor treated cells.

Here, we applied single-particle fluorescence imaging to directly observe the early checkpoints of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry pathways and separate binding from internalization. Fluorescent virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with either G614 or Omicron BA.5 S protein variants were imaged on HEK293T-ACE2 (TMPRSS2-negative) and classified at the single-particle level as surface-interacting, crossing, or internal. At baseline, G614 VLPs show higher binding and a larger internalized share than BA.5 VLPs, revealing general divergence in early entry behavior between variants. A trivalent anti-S receptor-binding domain aptamer reduces G614 binding and lowers its internalization. Conversely, the aptamer does not block BA.5 VLP cell binding but increases its internalization efficiency. Pitstop 2, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, causes no significant change in this observation window, consistent with early clathrin-sensitive events having already progressed. Quantification of trajectories reveals variant-specific mobility: BA.5 displays higher step length than G614, consistent with greater lateral scanning and surface retention.

Morphologically, this is reflected in mechanical deformations of the biofilm; known as wrinkles. In nature, biofilms often host different species of bacteria, allowing for a great diversity of matrix components. Here, we use a combination of two Escherichia coli strains as a model for a multispecies biofilm in which each bacterial strain produces one of two complementary matrix fibres: an amyloid protein (curli) or a polysaccharide (phosphoethanolamine-cellulose). Using fluorescence microscopy, we confirm that the two bacterial strains rapidly segregate into isogenic sectors, decreasing local heterogeneity. Furthermore, we show how wrinkles form, both in the homogenous central region of the biofilm, as well as at the boundary between sectors (i.e. where the two matrix producers co-localize).

The aspartate transaminases (glutamate oxaloacetate transaminases, cytosolic GOT1 and mitochondrial GOT2) have several important metabolic functions, including maintaining energy and redox balance and generating aspartate, an essential building block in protein and nucleotide biosynthesis. Previous studies of GOT proteins in preclinical tumor transplant models have yielded conflicting results regarding the requirement of GOT1 and GOT2 for PDA tumor growth. To assess the role of GOT proteins in tumor development and tumor maintenance, we generated conditional knockout mice for Got1 and Got2 and crossed these into pancreas-specific models. Whereas loss of either Got does not impact pancreas development, double Got1 and Got2 knockout results in markedly reduced pancreas size and cellularity without overtly impacting endocrine or exocrine function. In genetically engineered cancer models, single Got loss does not impact lesion formation, tumor size, animal survival, or the composition of the tumor microenvironment. Identical results were also observed in orthotopic allograft mouse models. Together, these findings add to a growing body of work illustrating the adaptability of metabolism in cancer.

PacBio IsoSeq long read sequencing and western blotting was used to confirm fusion gene expression. Findings were validated by rtPCR and western blotting on a separate cohort of 17 resection specimens from 14 pNET cases.

BEND2 fusions were associated with high grade tumors, as previously described.

However, it is unclear whether iPSC-derived cerebral organoids possess functional innate antiviral immunity against HIV-1. In this study, we examined Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) activation and its role in the induction of IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) against HIV-1 in human iPSC-derived microglia containing cerebral organoids (MCOs). We observed that MCOs possess functional TLR3, which could be effectively activated by poly I:C. TLR3 activation of MCOs resulted in HIV-1 inhibition and induction of IFN-{beta}/IFN-{lambda}, antiviral ISGs (MX1, MX2, GBP5, SAMHD1, Viperin, and ISG56), and CC chemokines (MIP-1, MIP-1{beta}, and RANTES), the ligands for HIV entry coreceptor CCR5. This TLR3 activation-mediated anti-HIV-1 effects could be blocked by a specific TLR3 inhibitor. These findings indicate that human iPSC-derived MCOs are a suitable model for investigation of brain immunity and HIV-1 infection.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of nanobodies against respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus in animal models. We previously reported the protective effects of nanobody trimers against SARS-CoV-2. However, pharmacokinetic and biodistribution data for nanobodies remain limited. To address this, we evaluated the efficacy, biodistribution and longevity of action of a nanobody trimer (A8) administered intranasally (IN) or intraperitoneally (IP) in Syrian golden hamsters. Our findings revealed that the A8 trimer reached peak concentrations shortly after administration and was subsequently cleared from the system via both routes.

Ex vivo human lymphocytes were used to investigate integrated mitochondrial, epigenetic, and inflammatory responses induced by polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoplastics. Fluorescence microscopy at multiple exposure time points and flow cytometry confirmed efficient cellular internalization and progressive intracellular accumulation of nanoplastics. Exposure elicited coordinated transcriptional remodeling of genes regulating mitochondrial dynamics (DRP1, MFN1), mitochondrial DNA encoded oxidative phosphorylation components (MT-ATP6, MT-COX1, MT-ND6), DNA repair (OGG1, APE1), DNA methylation machinery (DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b), and mitochondrial-associated miRNAs (miR-21, miR-34a, miR-155). Functional analyses revealed polymer and time-dependent disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory chain activities, with Complex I identified as the primary site of vulnerability. Correlation analysis showed strong positive associations among DRP1, OMA1, DELE1, and ND6 (r > 0.9, R^2 > 0.8, p < 0.001), reflecting coordinated mitochondrial stress and epigenetic signaling, while negative correlations between DRP1 and MFN1 (r = -0.54, R^2 = 0.29, p < 0.01) and between APE and ND6 (r {approx} -0.42, R^2 {approx} 0.18, p < 0.05) highlight antagonistic regulation and impaired mitochondrial network stability linked to Complex I dysfunction. In silico docking of oxidized nanoplastic oligomers identified high-affinity interactions at the Complex I Fe-S cluster and cofactor-binding sites, suggesting direct interference with electron transfer. A random forest-based model accurately predicted MT-ND6 expression from Complex I activity (R^2 > 0.85), establishing a data-driven Complex I-ND6 axis.

We then determine the in situ structure of V-ATPase and show that it is highly conserved relative to other eukaryotic V-ATPases. Analysis of the distribution of V-ATPases on the AMSs shows that they form clusters in which individual V-ATPases are tightly packed but do not oligomerise. Our data also show that complete, fully assembled V-ATPases line the AMSs. Previous studies have established that V-ATPases can only act as ATP-dependent proton pumps in their fully assembled state.

Understanding the signaling pathways that modulate mitochondrial content in response to changing energetic demands is therefore essential. This work examines how partial mitochondrial uncoupling reshapes mitochondrial content and metabolism in yeast and how such adaptations mirror features of pathological or age associated states. Using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP synthase mutant lacking the epsilon subunit ({Delta}{varepsilon}) and carrying a compensatory mutation that allows survival under uncoupling ({Delta}{varepsilon}+c-L57F), mitochondrial abundance, organization, and function were compared with those of wild-type and rescue strains (mutant re-expressing the epsilon subunit of the ATP synthase). Analyses included respiration assays, mitochondrial DNA quantification, {beta}-galactosidase reporters, fluorescence microscopy of the mitochondrial network, and 2D-DiGE proteomics. Uncoupling in the mutant led to a strong increase in mitochondrial mass per cell, higher respiratory capacity, elevated cytochrome levels, and increased mtDNA copy number, together with augmented transcriptional activity consistent with activation of HAP-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis. Despite a fragmented network, mitochondria retained typical ultrastructural features, while proteomic profiling indicated a shift toward ATP production via substrate-level phosphorylation. Overall, partial uncoupling promotes reversible mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic remodeling that depend on a preserved proton-motive force, highlighting mitochondrial signaling as a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and offer new perspectives for studying metabolic disorders and mitochondrial pathologies.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we discover an evolutionarily conserved, lipid-driven physical mechanism by which pathogenic bacterial EVs systemically arrest phagosome maturation in bystander host cells. Using live-cell fluorescence lifetime imaging, in vitro reconstitution and micromanipulation we show that EVs from diverse pathogens - Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus - fuse with host plasma, phagosomal, and lysosomal membranes. This fusion increases membrane tension and perturbs early phagosomal maturation. Transcriptomic profiling confirms a broad downregulation of phagosome maturation genes while upregulation of lysosomal stress responsive genes. Crucially, in vitro reconstitution shows that EVs, and their purified lipids alone, are sufficient to induce phase separation and increase membrane tension, directly inhibiting phago-lysosomal fusion. Our findings establish a paradigm in which pathogens exploit EVs not merely as delivery vehicles, but as tools to remotely rewire host cell membrane mechanics to hijack phagosome maturation and host defense - a strategy that moves beyond canonical effector-based models of pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

As embryogenesis proceeds, the epithelium differentiates to include a variety of enterocytes and secretory cells. During the period of epithelial cell differentiation a number of signaling pathways are used to generate the full complement of cell types. Notch signaling is important for the choice between enterocytes and secretory cells. Following the initial choice, both enterocytes and secretory cells continue differentiating into a number of different subtypes of each cell type. In the zebrafish embryo, Notch signaling is utilized at least three times during development of the intestinal epithelium. The first two Notch signaling events are involved in the choice between enterocytes and secretory cells, while the third involves differentiation of a unique cell type that we previously called Notch Receiving Secretory Cells (NRSCs). While we have identified the times when Notch signaling is active, the individual Notch receptors used in each signaling event have not been previously identified. Here we use loss of function mutants in the four Notch receptors (notch 1a, 1b, 2, and 3) to identify which are used in the each of the Notch signaling events. We find redundant use of Notch receptors in the choice between enterocytes and secretory cells with loss of combinations of either notch 2 and notch 3 or notch 2 and notch 1b but not loss of individual receptors resulting in changes to secretory cell numbers. During the Notch signaling event following the choice between secretory and enterocytes, we identify NRSCs as Bestrophin 4 (BEST4+) cells. In contrast to the choice between secretory and enterocyte cells, we find that loss of individual Notch receptors result in differing numbers of BEST4+ cells. Even though loss of individual receptors affect BEST4+ numbers we suggest that combinations of Notch receptors play a role in differentiation of different BEST4+ subtypes.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

The co-evolution between insects and their host plants should shape the genomes of both partners, and genes involved in interaction specificity should show unique genomic signatures (e.g., rapid evolution, gene family expansions). Biological control programs are an excellent system for disentangling the genomics and molecular biology of the establishment of an insect and its host plant specificity. Fern-insect relationships are among the most poorly understood, and ferns have long been thought to have few interactions with insects, although recent evidence suggests that these relationships are under-sampled and studied. Here, we present a near-chromosome genome assembly of the crambid moth Neomusotima conspurcatalis, a biological control agent employed in the management of the invasive vining fern Lygodium microphyllum. We use this novel genomic resource to explore the evolution of genome architecture across the Crambidae, revealing highly conserved genome structure across this family of moths.

However, contextual dependencies (the interplay between the host and the circuit) are often difficult to engineer rationally, leading to a lack of control over circuit behaviour. To address this challenge, we replaced the native regulatory machinery of the RNA polymerase (RNAP), the cell's core protein-making machine, from the bacteria Pseudomonas putida KT2440 with an inducible system, enabling tunable growth regulation and thereby gaining systemic control over the entire cellular machinery. Specifically, this was achieved by placing key components, the {beta} and {beta}' subunits of the enzyme, under the control of the XylS-Pm inducible system. By using its cognate chemical inducer, 3-methylbenzoate, cell's growth can be controlled at will, enabling the precise tuning of the cellular context into distinct, stable states. We correlated genetic circuit behaviour with the cell's growth state by observing the constitutive expression of a reporter gene and the performance of a collection of genetic NOT logic gates. Our results show that the modulation of contextual dependencies is specific to the circuit components but not a random process. A mathematical model allowed us to classify that modulation into three different categories for our library of NOT gates, based on the prediction of how RNAP availability shapes host-circuit interaction. Finally, using growth control as an input for a 2-input circuit lead to a NAND gate with the potential for morphological computing, where the cell's physical body itself undertakes part of the information processing. Our findings indicate that growth control can be used as an engineering parameter, allowing us to search for optimal scenarios that enhance the potential of genetic tools.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Deep learning (DL)-based automated segmentation may facilitate rapid assessment; however, its performance on hyperacute DWI has not been sufficiently assessed. The aim was to evaluate the agreement between DL-based automated and manual infarct volume measurements and to compare their ability to predict clinical outcomes in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Method: Consecutive MT-treated patients (September 2014-December 2019) who underwent DWI at admission and at approximately 24 hours were retrospectively analyzed. Manual infarct volume was measured by stroke neurologists. Automated measurements were obtained using DL-based software. Agreement was assessed using Pearson?s correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 2,1). Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were evaluated in a randomly selected subgroup of 150 patients. Predictive ability for a good outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale score 0?2 or stable/improved from premorbid status) was compared using C-statistics and DeLong's test. Results: A total of 371 patients (677 DWI scans) were included. Manual and automated measurements showed very strong correlation (r = 0.96) with minimal bias (?1.77 mL). The ICC for manual-automated agreement was 0.959 (95% CI, 0.952-0.965), comparable to inter- and intra-rater ICCs. Agreement remained high across onset-to-imaging times and lesion sizes. Predictive abilities for a good outcome were similar for manual and automated admission DWI volume (C-statistics 0.867 vs. 0.861) and infarct growth (0.859 vs. 0.853). Manual follow-up DWI volume showed slightly better predictive ability than automated measurement (0.880 vs. 0.866).

For these patients, alternative therapies offer additional options but yield inconsistent outcomes. Progress has been limited by the absence of objective, brain-based biomarkers to guide target selection or track therapeutic response in real time. Instead, clinicians rely on behavioral assessments that evolve slowly over weeks to months, obscuring the underlying neural dynamics of symptom changes. Here, we test whether the aperiodic exponent of intracranial EEG (iEEG) local field potentials can serve as a neurophysiological marker of depression symptom severity. We leveraged a large iEEG cohort (N = 20) undergoing invasive monitoring for refractory epilepsy, yielding over 1,800 contacts spanning cortical and subcortical zones. For each contact, we estimated the aperiodic exponent (thought to reflect aspects of cortical excitability) of the power spectrum across 10-100 Hz within local brain regions and across distributed cortical association networks. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) immediately before intracranial resting state recordings. With respect to the BDI-II scale, participants were identified as experiencing minimal (BDI-II [&le;] 13) or elevated depression symptoms (BDI-II [&ge;] 14). Associations between symptom severity (BDI-II total score and Somatic-Affective, Cognitive, and Anhedonia subscales) and region- or network-level exponents were modeled with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The whole-brain, mean aperiodic exponent for each participant discriminated symptom status (AUC = 0.81). At the regional level, the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala showed higher exponents in the elevated depression symptom group (d = 1.18-1.71; p = 0.032-0.004). A post-hoc classification analysis across these four regions misclassified one participant per group (AUC = 0.86; 95% CI 0.64-1.00). In continuous analyses, BDI-II scores correlated positively with exponents in these same four regions (pFDR = 0.019-0.027; partial r=0.61-0.70) and at the network level in the Salience network (pFDR = 0.024; partial r = 0.63) and Default (pFDR = 0.046; partial r = 0.55) network. The Salience network significantly tracked Anhedonia symptoms (p = 0.004; partial r = 0.62).

Using in vivo RNA-tagging, we demonstrate that these sinRNAs are packaged into extracellular vesicles released by infiltrating CD4 T lymphocytes and subsequently delivered to beta-cells during the early stages of autoimmune attack. Functional analyses revealed that overexpression of sinR-T has little effect on beta-cell viability, whereas sinR-D markedly increases beta-cell apoptosis. This finding suggests that the transfer of sinR-D contributes to beta-cell destruction and the onset of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, pull-down experiments with biotinylated sinRNAs identified Ago2, a core component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), as a binding partner of sinR-D, indicating mechanistic parallels with microRNA-mediated regulation.

We developed RADADOR version 2 to overcome allele dropout (ADO) issues in RAD-seq data sets. This version of RADADOR enabled us to recover ADO loci using low-coverage whole genome sequencing (lc-WGS) data (~5 to 10X coverage). We integrated previously generated plastome and RAD-seq data with whole genome data to build robust, genome-wide phylogenies. Subsequently, we employed PhyloNet to detect hybridization events in Torreya and utilized a fossilized birth-death model to estimate the formation times of Japanese Torreya species. Our phylogenetic results indicated conflicting nuclear and plastome topologies and suggested two historical hybridization events in Japanese Torreya. One ancient hybridization between T. nucifera and a North American lineage likely contributed to the origin of T. fruticosa, while a more recent event may have generated a putative hybrid in regions where their distributions overlap.

We discovered complex and simple structural variants (SVs) which together effectively double the length of a single haploid genome (530Mb haploid vs. 1.1Gb pan-genome). SVs show significant enrichment near transposable elements, including a novel retrotransposon-derived polyprotein with active expression. Genome-environment association analyses of SVs in 49 E. viminalis identified CHILL1, a 400-kb cold-adaptation locus on chromosome 1. Validation of this major locus with short-reads of 434 wild accessions of three related species (E. viminalis, E. dalrympleana, E. rubida) confirmed that CHILL1 genotype predicts cold adaptation better than species classification, with effect sizes equivalent to 440km in latitudinal or 307m altitudinal translocation. These findings demonstrate that structural variants harbor critical adaptive variation in wild tree populations that can be harnessed to understand plant abiotic stress tolerance and to design climate-informed restoration and conservation programs for forests of the future.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

This nematode belongs to the basal Dorylaimida order for which no chromosome-level reference genome is available so far. We combined long-read sequencing and Hi-C data to produce a high-quality T2T genome for X. index. Using comprehensive comparative genomics study with other nematode species, we identified a set of X. index-specific genes, including some coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes. Furthermore, we identified horizontal gene transfers including one originating from plants, a first report in the nematode phylum. Most importantly, we identified three canonical DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and one complete gene encoding for the chromatin remodeler alpha-thalassemia mental retardation X-linked (ATRX). Both were supposedly absent in nematodes so far. Additionally, our phylo-stratigraphic research in other nematodes revealed that (i) canonical DNMT1 are restricted to Dorylaimida and (ii) ATRX to the most basal nematode clades. This suggests a major reshuffling of the epigenetic machinery occurred after the separation with the common ancestor of all the other nematode clades. Furthermore, we (i) showed the presence of these pivotal epigenetic actors is concomitant with a clear DNA methylation at CpGs in X. index and, (ii) observed a genomewide association between the level of GpC methylation and chromatin accessibility at TSS and gene expression. Here, we unveil and analyze the reference genome of X. index as a representative for Dorylaimida, mimicking the vertebrate epigenetic toolkit. These findings will not only provide a key resource for plant-nematode parasitic interactions and virus-vector research but also foster further evolutionary and epigenetic studies contributing to deepen our understanding of the gene regulation at the whole-genome scale.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Participants walked on a 0{degrees} degree slope, followed by a -5{degrees} degree and 5{degrees} degree slope in random order. Doppler ultrasound probe was fastened over the dominant-side common femoral artery using a custom 3D printed bracket. LBF was recorded immediately before and after each walking condition. Baseline LBF was not significantly different before each walking condition (p = .577), but there were significant differences in post-walking (p < .001), with uphill causing the greatest increase in LBF. These results suggest that our ultrasound technique is repeatable during quiet standing and can detect the differences in blood flow across different walking intensities.

We aim to gain new insights into the immune responses underlying LN and their relation to the histologic heterogeneity observed in this disease, focusing on myeloid cells. Methods Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to profile dissociated kidney samples from 156 LN patients and 30 healthy individuals. Spatial transcriptomics (ST), utilizing a gene panel designed to capture all myeloid subsets identified in the scRNA-seq data, was applied to kidney samples acquired from 6 LN patients and 2 healthy controls. Results We generated a full catalog of the myeloid subsets found in LN kidneys. Our analyses indicated that an increase in irreversible tissue damage, as measured by the NIH chronicity index (CI), is associated with a gradual switch of the local immune response from one dominated by monocytes and macrophages to one featuring expanded CD4+ T, GZMK+CD8+ T, B and dendritic cells, with a parallel decrease in the interferon response. In proliferative/mixed LN only, the degree of active inflammation correlates with expansion of disease-specific macrophage (DMac) subsets, which later contract as the CI increases. Trajectory analysis of the scRNA-seq data suggested that DMacs arise from both infiltrating monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages; this was supported by the ST data, as well as cell cultures. DMacs are indicated to interact with parietal epithelial cells, promoting the development of glomerulosclerosis.

Longitudinal and radial variations in cortical porosity and canal architecture influence load distribution, vascularization, and remodeling. Understanding these gradients is essential for designing scaffolds and implants that mimic native bone structure and function. This study quantified longitudinal and radial microgradients in cortical porosity and canal diameter along the rabbit femur and explored their implications for bone regeneration and repair implant design. Rabbit femora were divided into proximal, mid-shaft, and distal regions. High-resolution micro-computed tomography quantified cortical thickness, porosity, and canal diameter along radial and longitudinal axes in micron-scale resolutions. Compressive mechanical testing of cortical slices determined local moduli, which were correlated with microstructural parameters to establish structure-function relationships. Cortical thickness peaked at the mid-shaft and decreased toward both ends. Porosity and canal diameter increased radially toward the medullary cavity and longitudinally toward the bone ends. Upto 500 micron cortical thickness from the outer surface toward modullary cavity, porosity and canal diameter ranged, respectively, from ~5% and 40 micron at the mid-shaft to ~40% and 110 micron at the ends. At 750 micron cortical thickness, porosity and canal diameter ranged, respectively, from ~5% and 50 micron at the mid-shaft to ~80% and 200 micron at the ends. As expected, compressive moduli declined linearly with increasing porosity and canal size. The mid-shaft, with the lowest porosity and smallest canals, exhibited the highest modulus of around 15MPa, which decreased to 5MPa toward the ends. The rabbit femur displays distinct longitudinal and radial microgradients in porosity and canal architecture that govern local stiffness. These gradients define structural benchmarks for designing functionally graded tissue engineering scaffolds and bone implants that replicate native tissue structure and stiffness transitions to promote osteoconduction, osteoinduction, osteogenesis in bone regeneration and improve osseointegration of bone implants.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Because cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement contributes to solute transport and waste removal and is strongly influenced by respiratory pressure dynamics, the study evaluated whether yawning alters neurofluid flow relative to normal and deep breathing, and whether yawning kinematics are reproducible within individuals. In a single MRI session in healthy adults, real-time phase-contrast imaging at the upper cervical level (C3) was combined with mid-sagittal real-time cine imaging to quantify CSF and internal jugular venous flows during normal breathing, forceful oral inspirations (deep breaths), yawns, and stifled yawns, and to derive tongue-motion trajectories. Both deep breaths and yawns increased CSF and venous flow compared with normal breathing; despite similar flow magnitudes, yawns more frequently produced co-directional caudal CSF and jugular outflow during inspiration, whereas deep breaths typically showed counter-directional CSF-venous flow. Yawning kinematics were highly reproducible within individuals across repeated events, indicating a stable motor sequence consistent with brainstem pattern-generator control. These observations show that yawning is not simply an intensified breath but a distinct cardiorespiratory manoeuvre that reorganizes neurofluid flow. The inspiratory alignment of CSF with venous outflow during yawns suggests a transient caudal advection that could influence solute transport and heat exchange within the cranial-cervical system, motivating targeted mechanistic studies with simultaneous airway pressure, thoraco-abdominal motion, and cervical venous pressure measurements.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

Whether and how this hierarchical directionality adapts to cognitive context, such as perceptual certainty, remains a fundamental question. We investigated this question in monkeys performing a complex delayed match-to-category task using intracranial recording and a novel connectivity analysis: Model-Based Representational Connectivity Analysis (RCA). This approach allowed us to simultaneously track the content, timing, and directionality of information flow between IT and PFC, while controlling for common task-general representations. Our Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) revealed that while both areas rapidly encoded the task-relevant information, IT coding was earlier and transient, whereas PFC exhibited stronger, sustained coding and content-specific recurrence during the memory delay, reflecting active maintenance of the category rule. Crucially, the directionality of information flow was highly modulated by stimulus certainty. For high-certainty stimuli (Far from the category boundary), we observed the classical, predicted feed-forward flow (IT -> PFC). However, for low-certainty stimuli (Close to the category boundary), this hierarchy dynamically reversed, with a dominant, early feedback (FB) flow (PFC -> IT), preceding the feed-forward sweep. This FB signal carried information related to the ambiguous stimuli, suggesting a top-down mechanism to enhance sensory representations. These results challenge fixed-hierarchy models of categorization, providing mechanistic evidence that the brain dynamically reconfigures the direction of information flow between sensory and executive areas as a function of perceptual difficulty. We propose that the PFC initiates a top-down biasing signal to IT when sensory evidence is ambiguous, thus serving as an adaptive, context-driven control mechanism.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

We identify Cell Cycle Exit and Neuronal Differentiation protein 1 (CEND1), expressed in both cell types, as a critical regulator of this process. Loss of CEND1 impairs activity-dependent glucose utilization, ATP generation, and stimulation-evoked activity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CEND1 assembles a complex with HK1, voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), and adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (ANT1) at hemifusion-like membrane junction between the outer/inner mitochondrial membrane, channeling mitochondrially derived ATP directly to HK1.

As myelination is a life-long process, the myelin laid down in development or adulthood could also affect synapse number or plasticity across the lifespan. We report that conditionally deleting the transcription factor, myelin regulatory factor (Myrf), to disrupt the myelin maintenance program in oligodendrocytes (OLs) from P57 (Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice), led to significant myelin loss and impaired action potential conduction and gross motor performance. By sparsely labelling layer V pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex, we could visualise the apical and basal dendrites and their excitatory post-synaptic dendritic spines and determined that spine density was normal in P57+60 Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice. However, a higher proportion of the dendritic spines were large, stable mushroom spines and generated larger amplitude miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents. These data indicate that the myelin maintenance program is critical for preserving neuron adaptability, homeostasis and glutamate sensitivity. When we instead prevented the addition of new OLs and myelin from P57, action potential conduction velocity and gross motor performance appeared normal. Spine density was also normal in Pdgfr-CreERTM :: Myrf fl/fl mice, however, spine morphology was changed along the basal dendrites of layer V M1 pyramidal neurons. At P117, the basal dendrites were frozen in a state that resembled P57 dendrites, as they retained a higher proportion of thin, plastic spines.

E.; Borglum, A.; Denham, M.; Brennand, K.; Qvist, P.", "abstract": "BRD1 is an epigenetic regulator implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, yet its role in human neuronal differentiation, maturation, and function remains poorly understood. Here we show that BRD1 haploinsufficiency disrupts early neuronal programming, resulting in accelerated maturation and altered neurodevelopmental trajectories in human induced glutamatergic neurons. Transcriptomic profiling reveals an early shift toward neuronal identity, characterized by downregulation of pluripotency markers and persistent upregulation of genes involved in synapse assembly and organization, including GRIA3. Despite this, BRD1+/- neurons form significantly smaller synapses and display increased neuronal activity. Our findings highlight BRD1 as a key regulator of neurodevelopmental timing and synaptic maturation, and network activity reinforcing growing evidence that disruptions in chromatin-mediated control of differentiation and synaptic organization contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The social behavior neural network (SBNN) is a circuit composed of reciprocally connected limbic structures that regulate a range of social behaviors, including aggression. Although both males and females of many species display aggressive behavior, studies of the neural circuitry underlying aggression have focused almost exclusively on males. In the present study, we investigated sex differences in neuronal activation of the neural circuitry controlling aggression in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We employed c-Fos immunohistochemistry to quantify neuronal activation following aggressive encounters between same-sex male and female dyads. Animals were tested in their home cage either alone (n=7 per sex) or with a same-sex, non-aggressive intruder (n=7 per sex) for 10 minutes. Our data revealed substantial sex differences in the neuronal activation of the SBNN following aggression. In some regions, neuronal activity changed in opposite directions in males and females compared to controls (e.g., posterior lateral septum), while in others, there was a change in neuronal activation in only one sex (e.g., medial amygdala). These findings support the hypothesis that the neural circuitry regulating aggression exhibits marked sexual differentiation.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

X.; Lee, M.; Yang, J.; Flanigan, W. R.; Pico, A. R.; Jain, I. H.; Nakamura, K.", "abstract": "Cellular energy metabolism and oxygen availability shape neuronal function and vulnerability, yet the genetic regulators of these metabolic processes in human neurons remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons across four distinct metabolic conditions and at three physiologically relevant oxygen tensions. This combinatorial approach enabled systematic interrogation of gene-environment interactions that govern neuronal metabolic adaptation. We identified genes--including genes associated with Leigh syndrome and autism spectrum disorder--whose importance for cell survival is highly sensitive to environmental context, revealing potential mechanisms underlying metabolic specification and selective neuronal vulnerability in neurological disorders. Our screens also uncovered regulators of neuronal glycolysis, including KIAA1429 and MAPT among others, which are previously uncharacterized modulators of neuronal glucose utilization and metabolic flexibility. Our work nominates candidate metabolic interventions and gene targets for enhancing neuronal resilience under hypoxic or nutrient-limited conditions.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}

D.; Lendemeijer, B.; Chen, Y.; Gogos, J. A.; Kushner, S. A.; Leong, K. W.; Tomer, R.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional neuronal cultures, such as brain organoids, have proven effective for in vitro modeling of brain development and disease. However, it remains unclear whether these systems can intrinsically generate the spatiotemporal network motifs that support cognitive function, particularly given their lack of sensory input. To address this, we developed a 3D long-range modular neuronal network approach to test whether dissociated embryonic hippocampal cells can self-organize into neuronal manifolds capable of generating network dynamics analogous to the in vivo hippocampal cell assemblies implicated in cognitive function. Using all-optical interrogation, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of cell assemblies and their hallmark features, including recurring sequential activation, hierarchical chaining, multi-day stability, resilience to perturbation, and attractor-like pattern completion. We further investigated the effects of acute ketamine exposure on these assemblies, revealing network-wide reconfiguration reminiscent of in vivo responses. Finally, we show that human iPSC-derived neurons can similarly self-organize into modular network architectures. Together, these findings are consistent with an intrinsically inside-out view of the brain, rather than a tabula rasa model in which sensory input is required for the emergence of cognitive network motifs, and open new avenues for in vitro modeling of network-level mechanisms relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-12-19", "journal": ""}
