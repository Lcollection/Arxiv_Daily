B.; Finlay, C.; Peralta, A. L.", "abstract": "While wetlands represent a small fraction (~5-10%) of the world's land surface, it is estimated that one-third of wetlands have been lost due to human activities. Wetland habitat loss decreases ecosystem benefits, including improved water quality and climate change mitigation. These microbially mediated functions are dependent on redox conditions, which are altered by soil hydrology and the presence of plants. We tested the overarching hypothesis that while microbial community composition would be resistant to change due to long-term hydrologic history, key functions like greenhouse gas production would remain plastic and responsive to short-term environmental shifts. Using a mesocosm design, we manipulated the duration of hydrologic conditions (i.e., stable dry, stable flooding, and alternating wet/dry) and the presence of plants to induce soil redox changes in wetland soils. We measured soil redox status, used targeted amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize microbial communities, and measured greenhouse gas production to assess microbial function. The eight-week hydrologic treatment shifted community composition but did not override the stronger effects of long-term hydrologic history. Methane and carbon dioxide fluxes were altered by short-term hydrologic treatment, with methane production favored in the wet treatment and carbon dioxide production favored in the dry treatment. Plant presence versus absence manipulation had little impact on soil microbiome composition or soil greenhouse gas production. The results highlight the resistance of microbial community structure shaped by historical hydrologic regimes, and emphasize that hydrologic conditions exert a stronger influence than plant presence on microbial composition and function. Predicting the outcomes of wetland disturbance and restoration requires an enhanced understanding of community stability and functional plasticity. Our results suggest that wetland hydrologic restoration can establish a stable microbial community that is resistant to environmental shifts, but microbial functions such as greenhouse gas emissions remain responsive to hydrologic disturbances, including flooding and drought.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

In this study we identifified and characterized one AMPs in T. serrulatus venom. After milking, the venom was fractioned by high performance liquid chromatography and the fractions were tested by liquid growth inhibition assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. The fraction identified with antimicrobial activity was analyzed by electrophoresis and mass spectrometry and this AMP (with molecular mass 6.882 kDa) has a similar amino acid sequence to TsTX-{kappa} beta, a neurotoxin that acts on ion channels. The TsTX-{kappa} beta in this study was identified by de novo sequencing. This peptide showed activity against all microorganisms tested.

Here, we studied two spider mite species evolving separately on tomato plants that hyper-accumulated cadmium, a stressful environment for herbivores, or on plants without cadmium. Through experimental evolution and structural stability theory, we found that both species coexist in the cadmium environment, but evolution of a single species in cadmium leads to exclusion. However, when both species evolve in cadmium they can coexist. This shift occured due to a simultaneous increase in intra and a decrease in interspecific competition in that environment. These predictions were further confirmed with complementary experiments of population dynamics. Therefore, population shifts to novel environments, even in absence of interspecific competitors, may have unforeseen evolutionary consequences for community composition and the maintenance of species diversity.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

E.; Born, G.; Bieli, D.; Affolter, M.; Mu\u0308ller, M.", "abstract": "The establishment of tissue axes is fundamental during embryonic development. In the Drosophila wing, the anterior/posterior (AP) and the dorsal/ventral (DV) compartment boundaries provide the basic coordinates around which the tissue develops. These boundaries arise as a result of two lineage decisions, the acquisition of posterior fate by the selector gene engrailed (en) and of dorsal fate by the selector gene apterous (ap). While the en expression domain is set up during embryogenesis, ap expression only starts during early wing development. Thus, the correct establishment of ap expression pattern with respect to en must be tightly controlled. Here we have functionally investigated the transcriptional inputs integrated by the ''early'' ap enhancer (apE) and their requirement for correct boundary formation. Detailed mutational analyses using CRISPR/Cas revealed a role of apE in positioning the DV boundary with respect to the AP boundary, with apE mutants often displaying mirror-image anterior wing duplications. We then designed and applied methods to accomplished tissue-specific enhancer disruption via dCas9 expression. This approach allowed us to dissect the spatio-temporal requirement of apE function, challenging the mechanism by which apE miss-regulation leads to AP defects. Base-pair resolution analyses of apE uncovered a single HOX binding site essential for wing development, which, when mutated, led to wingless flies. In the course of our studies, we found that the HOX gene Antennapedia (Antp) is fundamental for ap expression. In addition, we demonstrated that the transcription factors Pointed (Pnt), Homothorax (Hth) and Grain (Grn) are necessary for apE function. Together, our results provide a comprehensive molecular basis of early ap activation and the developmental consequences of its miss-regulation, shedding light on how compartmental boundaries are set up during development.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

The KEAP1-NRF2-ARE signaling pathway serves as the primary antioxidant system. However, current small molecule inhibitors are all covalently bound to KEAP1, meaning that once bound, they are not easily dissociated, while continuous inhibition of KEAP1 exhibits severe side effects. In this study, BLI, CETSA, Pull-down, Co-IP and HDX-MS assay analysis were conducted to detect the KEAP1 binding behavior of natural product, capsaicin (CAP), both in vitro and in cells. The ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal damage rat model was also established to evaluate the therapeutic effect of CAP. Our findings demonstrated that CAP mitigated mitochondrial damage, facilitated the nuclear translocation of NRF2, leading to the up-regulation of downstream antioxidant response elements, HMOX1, TXN, GSS and NQO1 in GES-1 cells. Furthermore, CAP directly bind to KEAP1 and inhibit the interaction between KEAP1 and NRF2. In the KEAP1-knockout 293T cells, CAP failed to activate NRF2 expression. We identified that CAP non-covalently bound to Kelch domain and allosterically regulated three specific regions of KEAP1L342-L355, D394-G423 and N482-N495. To improve drug solubility and delivery efficiency, we developed IR-Dye800 modified albumin coated CAP nanoparticles. The nanoparticles significantly reduced the gastric mucosal inflammation and activated NRF2 downstream genes in vivo. Our hypothesis was further verified our hypothesis in Nfe2l2-knockout mice. This study provides new insights that CAP is a safe and novel NRF2 agonist by allosterically regulating KEAP1, which may contribute to the development of lead drugs for oxidative stress-related illness, e.g. aging, cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

The biological processes underlying learning and memory are mediated by a variety of genes in the nervous system, acting at specific times during memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Many studies have utilised candidate gene approaches or random mutagenesis screens in model animals to explore the key molecular drivers for learning and memory. We propose a complementary approach to identify this network of learning regulators: the proximity-labelling tool TurboID, which promiscuously biotinylates neighbouring proteins, to snapshot the proteomic profile of neurons during learning. To do this, we expressed the TurboID enzyme in the entire nervous system of C. elegans and exposed animals to biotin only during the training step of an appetitive gustatory learning paradigm. Our approach revealed hundreds of proteins specific to trained worms, including components of molecular pathways previously implicated in memory in multiple species such as insulin signalling, G protein-coupled receptor signalling, and MAP kinase signalling. Most (87-95%) of the proteins identified are neuronal, with relatively high representation for neuron classes involved in locomotion and learning. We validated several novel regulators of learning, including cholinergic receptors (ACC-1, ACC-3, LGC-46) and putative arginine kinase F46H5.3. These previously uncharacterised learning regulators all showed a clear impact on appetitive gustatory learning, with F46H5.3 showing an additional effect on aversive gustatory memory. Overall, we show that proximity labelling can be used in the brain of a small animal as a feasible and effective method to advance our knowledge on the biology of learning.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Despite the importance of the accessory factors, they are poorly conserved at the sequence level suggesting that these factors may adopt unique functions in different species. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the genetic and physical interactions between the DSB factors in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans providing new insights into conserved and novel functions of these proteins. This work shows that HIM-5 is the determinant of X-chromosome-specific crossovers and that its retention in the nucleus is dependent on DSB-1, the sole accessory factor that interacts with SPO-11.

We find that these proteins are strongly enriched at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) relative to conserved proteins, and that they integrate into cellular systems through conserved membrane targeting, trafficking, and degradation pathways. Despite having unrelated sequences, ER-localized de novo proteins share a common molecular signature: a C-terminal transmembrane domain that likely enables recognition by conserved post-translational ER insertion pathways. After insertion, ER-localized de novo proteins traffic from the ER and their homeostasis is regulated by conserved proteasomal and vacuolar degradation pathways.

Although Def1 is localized in the cytoplasm, its functions in this cellular compartment are not yet understood. Despite its well-established roles in transcription, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of its impact on gene expression has not been conducted. Here, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on cells lacking DEF1 and surprisingly found that only a few hundred genes exhibited altered expression, both upregulated and downregulated. To evaluate mRNA synthesis and decay rates in these DEF1-deficient cells, we used a nascent transcription metabolic labeling technique called RATE-SEQ. As expected, we observed reduced synthesis rates across the genome in these cells. Additionally, a global decrease in mRNA decay rates was observed, suggesting that Def1 plays a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. The changes in synthesis and decay rates showed a strong correlation, indicating that this compensation helps buffer steady-state mRNA levels. To gain further insight into Def1's functions, we conducted proximity labeling experiments to identify its protein binding partners within the cells. Our findings revealed that Def1 primarily interacts with cytoplasmic regulators involved in post-transcriptional processes, including proteins responsible for deadenylation, decapping, and translation regulation. Using an mRNA decay reporter assay, we demonstrated that recruiting Def1 to mRNA reduces its expression and accelerates its turnover. In summary, we have identified a novel cytoplasmic function for Def1, establishing it as a key regulator of gene expression in both transcription and mRNA decay.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

However, in real world scenarios, manipulation tasks are often performed while concurrent monitoring of the environment, resulting in competition for gaze. Here we examined gaze-hand coordination under such conditions. Participants performed a manipulation task, that involved grasping balls and placing them at target locations, while concurrently monitoring a display to detect probabilistically occurring visual events, which required central vision. Participants managed gaze competition in two main ways. First, fixations allocated to the action task were brief and prioritized directing the hand towards the goal (object or target location); participants then relied on tactile feedback to complete the action (grasping or placing the object). When tactile feedback was reduced--by using a tool instead of the fingertips to perform the task--gaze additionally served the guiding function. Second, participant reduced gaze competition by exploiting temporal regularities of events in the monitoring task. Specifically, they adjusted both gaze allocation and hand movement timing to reduce the likelihood that action task fixations would coincide with visual events.

We assess how much restoration is needed for a self-sustaining healthy coral reef using a mathematical model and real-world restoration case studies. We find that a reef with low macroalgal cover and high coral recruitment requires low levels of restoration to ensure self-sustaining high coral cover but as nutrient enrichment and fishing increase, more restoration is required.

The success of GS fundamentally depends on the accuracy of genomic prediction (GP) models. However, conventional GP models often struggle to capture inter-individual variability and are particularly challenged by the curse of dimensionality - where the number of features (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP) far exceeds the number of samples-ultimately limiting their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we proposed Contrastive Learning and Chromosome-aware Network (CLCNet), a novel deep learning framework that, for the first time, integrates multi-task learning with contrastive learning for GP. CLCNet consists of two key components: (i) a contrastive learning module, designed to enhance the model ability to capture fine-grained genotype-dependent phenotypic differences across individuals; and (ii) a chromosome-aware module, which performs feature selection at both the chromosome level and genome-wide level to retain the most informative SNPs. The performance of CLCNet was evaluated across four major crop species-maize (Zea mays), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), rapeseed (Brassica napus), and soybean (Glycine max)-across ten distinct traits. This evaluation involved a comprehensive comparison with three classical linear models (rrBLUP, Bayesian Ridge, Bayesian Lasso), two machine learning models (LightGBM, SVR), and two deep learning models (DNNGP, DeepGS). CLCNet consistently outperformed all comparator models, surpassing the average of classical linear models by ~3.84%, the best-performing machine learning model by 4.84%, and leading deep learning models by over 5%.

For well-practiced routines, agency is relinquished in favor of automatic habits. Here, we used cell-type specific, longitudinal, cellular-resolution, microendoscopic calcium imaging, chemogenetics, instrumental conditioning and a test of behavioral strategy to ask how dorsomedial striatum D1+ and D2/A2A+ neurons contribute to the formation of agency and habit. We found that DMS D1+ neurons stably encode actions and variables related to goal-directed v. habitual behavioral strategy, develop encoding of the action-outcome relationship, and are critical for both action-outcome learning and the application of this learned agency for flexible, goal-directed decision making. Conversely, one ensemble of A2A+ neurons transiently encodes actions and behavioral transition variables during early action-outcome learning and another slowly starts to encode actions as routine habits form. Correspondingly, A2A+ neurons are only transiently necessary for initial formation of the action-outcome model underlying agency. Thus, agency is learned through DMS D1+ and A2A+ neuronal activity and then maintained in DMS D1+ neurons to support adaptive, goal-directed decision making. Habit formation is associated with reorganization of A2A+ neuronal encoding. These data reveal important insights into the neuronal circuits of learning and decision making.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Using 16S, 18S rRNA gene, and ITS2 region metabarcoding on soils from natural stands and potting mix, rhizosphere, and root samples from a greenhouse common garden, we examined prokaryotic and fungal communities in two aspen genetic groups. The Eastern Canada group represents boreal and cold temperate ecoregions, and the one from Northwestern Mexico represents warm temperate ecoregion. Variation in microbial community structure correlated with soil properties but results from common gardens indicated that the host genetic makeup may also play a role. The three ecoregions showed functional divergence: warm temperate sites hosted a higher abundance and diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, while boreal stands exhibited stronger associations with ectomycorrhizal fungi.

S.; Baer, C. F.", "abstract": "The importance of genomic structural variants (SVs) is well-appreciated, but much less is known about their mutational properties than of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short indels. The reason is simple: the longer the variant, the less likely it will be covered by a single sequencing read, thus the harder it is to map unambiguously to a unique genomic location. Here we report SV mutation rate estimates from six mutation accumulation (MA) lines from two strains of C. elegans (N2 and PB306) using long-read (PacBio) sequencing. The inferred SV mutation rate is ~1/10 the SNV rate and ~1/4 the short indel rate. We identified 40 mutations and 52 false positive (FP) variants by manual inspection of each SV call. Excluding one atypical line (5 mutations, 35 FPs), the signal (mutant) to noise (FP) ratio is approximately 2:1. False negative rates were determined by simulating variants in the reference genome and observing 'recall'. Recall rate ranges from >90% for short indels and declines as SV length increases. Small deletions have nearly the same recall rate as small insertions (~100bp), but deletions have higher recall rates than insertions as size increases. The reported SV mutation rate is likely a lower bound. A quarter of identified SV mutations occur in SV hotspots that harbor pre-existing low complexity repeat variation. Comparison of the spectrum of spontaneous SVs to wild isolates implies that natural selection is not only efficient at removing SVs in exons but also removes roughly half of SVs in intergenic regions.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

From RNA-Seq data that have been generated with one of the specialized protocols, it is possible to identify transcription start sites (TSS) and/or endoribonucleolytic cleavage sites, and even, in some cases, co-translational 5' to 3' degradation dynamics. Furthermore, post-transcriptional addition of ribonucleotides at the 3' end of RNA can be studied at the nucleotide resolution. While different RNA-end sequencing library protocols exist that have been adapted to a specific organism (prokaryote or eukaryote) or specific biological question, the generated RNA-Seq data are very similar and share common processing steps. Most importantly, the major aspect of RNA-end sequencing is that only the 5' or 3' end mapped location is of interest, contrary to conventional RNA sequencing that considers genomic ranges for gene expression analysis. This translates to a simple representation of the quantitative data as a count matrix of RNA-end location on the reference sequences.

Here we report selective interactions between sensory integration, temporal prediction, and rule discovery in humans. Participants were exposed to rhythmic sequences of 10 stimuli governed or not by a latent rule - a predictable change in stimulus statistics after 5 stimuli - and then asked to predict the 10th stimulus from incomplete sequences. Individual differences in sensory integration timescale for rule-free sequences predicted efficient rule discovery. Conversely, discovering the latent rule shaped the timescale and format of sensory integration for rule-based sequences. Tampering with the rhythmicity of stimulus presentation impaired rule discovery without affecting sensory integration accuracy.

Using genomic and electronic health record data from 13,143 individuals in the Biorepository for Integrative Genomics, we applied a hierarchical community detection algorithm to classify individuals by the proportion of the genome shared identical by descent. This approach identified four major communities concordant with continental ancestry and seventeen subcommunities capturing fine scale demographic structure beyond conventional ancestry classifications. Integrating neighborhood level geographic data and census derived environmental metrics revealed unequal exposure to environmental stressors across IBD-defined subcommunities. IBD-based grouping improved statistical modeling of disease risk and identified subpopulations with elevated rates of respiratory and dermatological conditions. We implemented an open-source dashboard that enables realtime clinical decision support and public health surveillance by correlating IBD-defined subcommunities with disease prevalence and environmental exposures a unique capability that transforms biobank data into actionable insights for participants while maintaining privacy.

Evidence for actualized disassortative mating based on the human-specific MHC remains inconclusive. For instance, cosmopolitan populations have often exhibited the opposite trend whereby assortative mating at the MHC is observed, indicating that social stratification may overwhelm potential biological mate preferences. However, small-scale, endogamous populations--whose social structures more closely resemble those throughout most of human evolution--have been largely overlooked. Here, we assess HLA dissimilarity among Himba pastoralists from Namibia, where socially accepted concurrency allows individuals to maintain both arranged marital and self-selected (\"love match\") partnerships. This provides a rare opportunity to directly test HLA similarity across contrasting partnership types (arranged vs chosen) within the same social system (n = 249 observed partnerships). We find no difference in HLA dissimilarity (neither at the genotype nor protein divergence level) between partnership types, nor in their fitness benefits to potential offspring as assessed via computationally predicted pathogen binding affinities. The effects of the partnership types likewise do not differ from a random, background distribution of 18,487 possible unrelated pairings. Finally, we detect extensive haplotype sharing across the HLA region, suggesting that episodes of fluctuating positive selection may be a stronger force maintaining HLA polymorphism than disassortative mating, even in an evolutionarily relevant social context.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

While cortical connectomes are intrinsically high-dimensional, population activity typically resides in a much lower-dimensional subspace. Consequently, only a small fraction of the information encoded in the connectome appears relevant for shaping activity. Can we identify low-dimensional features of the connectome features be that reliably predict neural activity? Leveraging the MICrONS dataset, which combines millimeter-scale, nanometer-resolution connectivity with simultaneously recorded in-vivo activity, we demonstrate a statistically significant alignment between morphological and functional similarity, quantified by subspace angles and centered kernel alignment. Topological analyses further reveal that the representation spaces of both the connectome and neural activity share a low-dimensional hyperbolic geometry with exponential scaling. These parallels motivated the hypothesis that embedding anatomical affinities into an appropriate geometric space can isolate the functionally relevant features of the connectome. We therefore applied multidimensional scaling to generate such embeddings and trained a simple linear model to reconstruct neuronal activity. Remarkably, the embedded connectome explained 68% in activity similarity, surpassing models that had direct access to activity similarity itself and outperforming similarly simple models that used the full high-dimensional connectome (56%). Our findings uncover a robust structure-function coupling: geometry-aware dimensionality reduction discards much of the connectome's microscopic detail yet yields superior predictions of neural activity.

We show that male hybrids between D. simulans and D. mauritiana fail to properly express key Y-linked fertility genes.

In the hybrids, these gigantic introns are misprocessed, resulting in widespread splicing defects, including aberrant \"back-splicing\" events that join later exons to earlier ones.

In Mucor bainieri, most FK506-resistant isolates (90%) were found to be unstable and transient, readily reverting to drug sensitivity when passaged without drug, and with no associated DNA mutations. In half of the isolates (50%), FK506-resistance was conferred by RNAi-dependent epimutation in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silenced the fkbA encoding FKBP12 post-transcriptionally. In contrast, most of the remaining FK506-resistant isolates (40%) were found to have undergone heterochromatin-mediated silencing via H3K9 dimethylation, transcriptionally repressing fkbA and neighboring genes. In these heterochromatic epimutants, only minimal enrichment of siRNA to the fkbA locus was observed, but in three of the four examples, siRNA was significantly enriched at a locus distant from fkbA. A similar mechanism operates in Mucor atramentarius, where FK506 resistance was mediated by ectopic heterochromatin silencing fkbA and associated genes with siRNA spreading across the region.

We therefore hypothesized that overexpressing Parkin, a key mitophagy regulator, may improve mitochondrial and muscle health in a mouse model of DMD. To this end, Parkin was overexpressed using intramuscular injections of adeno-associated viruses performed in 5-week-old and 18-week-old D2.B10-Dmdmdx/J mice (D2.mdx), a widely used mouse model of DMD. Four and 16 weeks of Parkin overexpression initiated in 5-week-old and 18-week-old D2.mdx, respectively, resulted in muscle hypertrophy, as indicated by an increase in muscle mass and fiber cross-sectional area. While Parkin overexpression did not impact maximal mitochondrial respiration or mitochondrial content, it increased the Acceptor Control Ratio, an index of mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency. Parkin overexpression also decreased mitochondrial H2O2 emission, a surrogate for mitochondrial ROS production.

We describe a novel semi-field method to study the influence of nutrition on brood rearing using standardised small colonies formed de novo (ca. 1500 nurse-age bees and a queen) housed in adapted mating-nucs, placed inside an enclosure and limited to feeding on chemically defined diets. Complete assessments were conducted every fifteen days, assisted by a bespoke device to photograph every frame to measure cell contents. A novel metric describes the number of bees generated per gram of diet consumed, measuring the impact of nutrition on brood rearing and overall colony size.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

How- ever, their reconstruction often relies on limited-length sequences and may not account for complex evolutionary events, such as gene duplications, losses, or incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which are not modeled by standard phylogenetic methods. To address these challenges, it is common to first infer gene trees using conventional models, then refine them through species tree-aware correction methods. Recently, it has been argued that such corrections can lead to overfitting and force gene trees to resemble the species tree, thereby obscuring genuine gene-level variation caused by ILS. In this paper, we challenge and refute this hypothesis, and we demonstrate that, when applied carefully, correction methods can offer significant benefits, even in the presence of ILS", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium melibiose permease (MelBSt), which catalyzes the symport of galactosides with Na+, H+, or Li+, is a prototype of this important transporter superfamily. We have published the structures of the inward- and outward-facing conformations of MelBSt with galactoside or Na+ bound, determined the binding thermodynamic cycle, and proposed that positive cooperativity between the two co-transported solutes plays a key role in the symport mechanism of MelBSt. The molecular basis for this core mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we determined the molecular basis for this core symport mechanism through analyzing the structural dynamics of MelBSt and effects induced by melibiose, Na+, or both using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). We also refined the specific determinants for the sugar recognition in both protein and galactoside molecules by solving the crystal structures of a uniporter D59C MelBSt bound to melibiose and other sugars, and identified a critical water molecule as part of sugar recognition. Our integrated studies from structure, HDX-MS, and molecular dynamics simulations support the conclusion that sugar-binding affinity is directly correlated with protein dynamics. The binding of the coupling cation at a remote site functions as an allosteric activator to restrain the conformational flexibility of dynamic residues in the sugar-binding site and in the cytoplasmic gating salt-bridge network, thereby increasing sugar-binding affinity allosterically. This study provides a molecular-level schematic of the fundamental symport mechanism via positive cooperativity, which may serve as a general mechanism for cation-coupled symporters.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Background - The Jak2V617F (Jak2VF) mutation is an important cause of both clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Mouse models of Jak2VF CHIP and MPN show accelerated atherosclerosis progression, driven by macrophage inflammasome activation. We undertook the present study to assess the hypothesis that ongoing inflammation would impede atherosclerosis resolution in Jak2VF mice. Methods and Results - Chimeric Jak2VF/WT or control WT/WT bone marrow was transplanted into Ldlr-/- mice and, following 13-16 weeks of Western diet-induced atherosclerosis progression, cholesterol was lowered either moderately (to 200-300 mg/dl) or markedly (to 100 mg/dl). With moderate cholesterol lowering, there was impaired resolution of lesions in Jak2VF MPN mice compared to controls. However, with marked cholesterol lowering, progression of lesions was halted in both Jak2VF MPN and control mice while macrophage burden was decreased and lesional collagen was increased similarly in Jak2VF MPN and control mice. Two mechanisms of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering-induced suppression of inflammation in plaques were implicated: 1) reversal of increased proliferation, DNA damage and Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome activation specifically in Jak2VF macrophages and 2) markedly increased macrophage triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), c-myc expressing macrophages in both Jak2VF and control mice. Conclusions - Aggressive LDL lowering reverses inflammasome activation and induces pro-resolving changes in macrophages in Jak2VF MPN, halting atherosclerosis progression and promoting features of plaque stabilization. These findings suggest that aggressive LDL cholesterol lowering could reverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) risk in individuals with JAK2VF CHIP or MPN.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

In dioecious plant species, which display pronounced sexual dimorphism, these intricate interactions may vary in magnitude and direction between females and males, with significant implications for plant population dynamics and species co-evolution. In this study, we examined how infestation by the oligophagous aphid Brachycaudus lychnidis affects sex-specific interactions among the dioecious plant Silene latifolia and its specialist moth pollinator Hadena bicruris. We exposed male and female plants to aphid herbivory and evaluated its effects on floral traits (visual cues, floral scent, and nectar chemistry) and pollinator behaviour. While aphid infestation affected some floral traits equally in both sexes and others more strongly in males or in females, we observed stronger declines in female attractiveness to pollinators, which were mainly linked to nectar compounds potentially acting as feeding cues or behavioural modulators. We discuss our results in the light of sexual selection and plant defence theory while emphasizing the complementarity of female and male traits in stabilizing this specialized plant-pollinator-herbivore system.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Shared and unshared structure across such datasets can be identified in an unsupervised manner with Advanced Coupled Matrix and Tensor Factorization (ACMTF), but this cannot be related to an outcome. Conversely, N-way Partial Least Squares (NPLS) is supervised and captures outcome-associated variation but cannot identify shared and unshared structure. To bridge the gap between data exploration and prediction, we introduce ACMTF-Regression (ACMTF-R), an extension of ACMTF that incorporates a regression step, allowing for the simultaneous decomposition of multi-way data while explicitly capturing variation associated with a dependent variable. We present a detailed mathematical formulation of ACMTF-R, including its optimisation algorithm and implementation. Through extensive simulations, we systematically evaluate its ability to recover a small y-related component shared between multiple blocks, its robustness to noise, and the impact of the tuning parameter ({pi}) which controls the balance between data exploration and outcome prediction. Our results demonstrate that ACMTF-R can robustly identify the y-related component, correctly identifying outcome-associated shared and distinct variation, distinguishing it from existing approaches such as NPLS and ACMTF. The development of ACMTF-R was motivated by a real-world dataset investigating how maternal pre-pregnancy BMI affects the human milk microbiome, human milk metabolome, and infant faecal microbiome. Emerging evidence suggests that inter-generational transfer of maternal obesity may affect multiple omics layers, highlighting the need to identify outcome-associated variation. The applicability of ACMTF-R is therefore validated by applying it to this multi-omics dataset. ACMTF-R successfully identifies novel mother-infant relationships associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, underscoring its utility in multi-omics research.

Humeral shape varied significantly with body mass, centroid size, foraging strategy, geographic range size, and latitude, reflecting the joint influence of scaling, spatial ecology, and behavioral demands. Traplining, territorial, and opportunistic species occupied partially distinct regions of morphospace, and foraging strategy exerted a significant effect on evolutionary tempo, with trapliners evolving humeral morphology at consistently faster rates. Continuous ecological predictors, however, did not explain variation in evolutionary rates. Phylogenetic partial least squares revealed strong evolutionary integration between proximal and distal humeral regions, indicating that morphological changes are tightly coordinated across the bone. Together, these results show that humeral evolution in hummingbirds is shaped by the interaction of ecological differentiation, biomechanical constraints, and strong internal integration, illustrating how functionally complex structures diversify under multiple selective pressures.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Especially among wild animals, the neuromolecular mechanisms underlying individual variation in neophobia have not been well characterized. We examined three neophobic behaviors in captive female and male Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) from a wild population introduced to the USA in 1870: responses towards novel objects, novel foods, and repeated presentations of the same initially novel object. We compared transcriptomic patterns associated with neophobia in three brain regions, the striatum, dorsal hippocampus, and rostral hippocampus, using differential expression and co-expression network analyses. We found that the striatum and hippocampus had distinct transcriptomic profiles, as did the rostral and caudal subregions of the hippocampus, supporting recent hypotheses that these subregions are functionally specialized. Despite the absence of sex differences in neophobic behaviors, neophobia-associated gene modules revealed sex-specific patterns within brain regions. For females, neophobic behaviors more strongly correlated with gene modules in the caudal hippocampus, a region involved in stress and anxiety, whereas for males, neophobic behaviors correlated with gene modules in the rostral hippocampus, a region that may play a larger role in spatial cognition. These modules exhibited significant overlap, suggesting that neophobic behaviors in both females and males are driven by shared neurobiological mechanisms, though they exhibit sex-specific patterns of brain region localization.

Here, we identify a universal physical signature of cohesin loop density in Hi-C contact statistics at short genomic separations. In this regime, contact statistics simplify dramatically and loops can be treated as static, enabling an analytically solvable equilibrium polymer theory for a looped chain with finite contact detection. The theory predicts a characteristic dip in the slope of the contact probability curve that depends only on two parameters: cohesin loop density and the contact capture radius determined by the experimental protocol. Applying this framework to diverse mammalian Hi-C datasets, we infer a conserved loop density of approximately six loops per megabase. Independent cohesin copy-number measurements from quantitative imaging and mass spectrometry match this value, indicating that loop extrusion is predominantly monomeric in vivo, although rare or transient higher-order assemblies cannot be excluded. More broadly, this framework integrates Hi-C, imaging, and biochemical measurements within a single physical model, providing new mechanistic insight into how motor proteins organize chromatin in vivo.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Applied to modelling primary and lung metastatic breast cancer, SITE revealed tissue-specific TME interactions and ERK signalling patterns linked to distinct single-cell behaviours. We found that the earliest steps in tumour establishment and metastatic seeding involved active cell protrusion and the establishment of a multicellular niche interfacing tumour and host. Experimental and mathematical modelling showed that ERK signalling was co-influenced by these interactions, where cancer cluster formation increased signalling via the establishment of local signalling circuits. Disruption of these signalling circuits led to tissue-specific impacts on cancer intrinsic and TME interaction dynamics.

RNA-seq and clinical data from a multi-institutional cohort (n = 172) were analyzed; FA and GLN pathway activities were inferred by single-sample gene set variation analysis (ssGSEA), tumors were stratified by glycolysis state, and FA-GLN associations were evaluated at pathway, enzyme-class (medium, long, and very long-chain; VLCFA >= C20), and family levels using correlation, Fisher-z meta-analysis, and bootstrap resampling. FA-GLN coordination varied with glycolysis: membrane-focused families (glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids) coupled most strongly to GLN in low-glycolysis tumors; coupling shifted toward very-long-chain FA enzymes in medium-glycolysis tumors; and weakened in high-glycolysis tumors. Family-level contrasts confirmed weaker glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid coupling in high versus low glycolysis. A complementary metabolite-inference analysis identified three metabolic phenotypes that preserved these glycolysis-stratified FA-GLN relationships, supporting a broader coordinated metabolic structure.

V.", "abstract": "The cohesin complex is composed of core ring proteins (Smc1, Smc3 and Mcd1) and associated factors (Pds5, Scc3, and Rad61) that bind via Mcd1. Cohesin extrusion (looping from within a single DNA molecule) and cohesion (the tethering together of two different DNA molecules) underlie the many roles that cohesins play in chromosome segregation, gene transcription, DNA repair, chromosome condensation, replication fork progression, and genomic organization. While cohesin function flanks the activities of critical cell checkpoints (including spindle assembly and DNA damage checkpoints), the extent to which cells directly target cohesins in response to aberrant cohesin function remains unknown. Based on prior evidence that cells mutated for cohesin contain reduced Mcd1 protein, we tested whether loss of Mcd1 is based simply on cohesin instability. We find that Mcd1 loss persists even in rad61 cells, which contain elevated levels of stable chromosome-bound cohesins, contrary to a simple instability model. In fact, re-elevating Mcd1 levels suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth defects of all cohesin alleles tested, revealing that Mcd1 loss is a fundamental mechanism through which cohesins are inactivated to promote cell lethality. Our findings further reveal that cells that exhibit aberrant cohesin function employ E3 ligases to target Mcd1 for degradation. This mechanism of degradation appears unique in that Mcd1 is reduced during S phase, when Mcd1 levels typically peak and despite a dramatic upregulation in MCD1 transcription. We infer from these latter findings that cells contain a negative feedback mechanism used to maintain Mcd1 homeostasis.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Fifty-nine healthy adults completed resting-state and task-based fMRI on three separate days on which they received methylphenidate, haloperidol, or placebo in a double-blind placebo-controlled design.

Despite major advances in long-read sequencing technologies and graph-based assembly algorithms, current assemblies often remain incomplete and require refinement, including correction of haplotype switching and resolution of gaps, particularly within repetitive regions such as ribosomal DNA clusters and recent segmental duplications. These limitations largely stem from challenges in graph curation and are not adequately addressed by conventional polishing methods, which focus primarily on nucleotide-level corrections. To overcome these issues, we developed Verkko-Fillet, a Python-based interactive framework for genome graph inspection, editing, and curation that also provides step-by-step guidelines for downstream polishing. Verkko-Fillet takes as input Verkko output files, including the assembly graph, haplotype paths, Hi-C contacts, and additional ONT reads or alternative assemblies aligned to the graph, and offers tools for visualizing, modifying, and exporting curated assembly graphs. It enables users to track changes, resolve complex structural features, fill gaps, and enhance assembly quality beyond conventional polishing.

In contrast, poised enhancers (PEs) are scarce in naive hPSCs that model preimplantation epiblast. PEs form abundant chromosomal contacts with developmental genes, but when these contacts emerge, how their formation relates to enhancer poising and their functional significance remains incompletely understood. Here, we devise high-resolution, PE-targeted Capture Hi-C to generate a comprehensive atlas of PE chromosomal contacts in the time course of hPSC transition from the naive to primed state. We find that enhancer poising emerges early in the transition, while the contacts show diverse dynamics that is only partially coupled to poising. PROTAC-induced degradation of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) early in the transition weakens PE connectivity, while inhibition of its H3K27 methyltransferase activity does not, suggesting a non-catalytic role of Polycomb in supporting PE contacts. Notably, PE contacts persist after developmental activation or ectopic CRISPRa targeting and can mediate long-range gene induction. Together, these findings reveal the temporal and mechanistic principles of PE connectivity, highlighting a potential role of PE contacts in establishing gene expression patterns in human development.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

These functions are largely based on the metabolic activity of microbial communities, which arises from the individual members' contributions and their interactions. However, microbial functions and interactions are often inferred from simplified systems such as pure or pairwise cultures. Larger communities, in particular, are mainly analysed by metagenomics and the activity is deduced from the genetic potential of their community members. Although these approaches allow detailed insights into compositions, pairwise interactions and potential functions, they neglect the complexities of microbial communities, as evident in higher-order relationships, competition outcomes and the regulatory influence of environmental factors and other community members. Here, we study a mouse gut community along a gradient of complexity - from monocultures, to in vitro communities, to the mouse gut, to probe how bacteria adapt metabolically to their biotic and abiotic environments. Using metaproteomics to analyze realized bacterial niches and metabolic modeling to infer community interactions, we found that bacteria substantially modify their carbon source usage, biosynthetic activities, and protein allocation when grown in communities versus isolation. Furthermore, communities themselves adapted to their growth environment, changing in functionality as well as in the metabolic network between members. Host-associated communities isolated from the mouse gut invested in resource acquisition and utilized a broader spectrum of carbon sources, resulting in a large increase of predicted interactions between them. Our findings demonstrate the remarkable adaptability of microbes and microbial communities across environmental contexts.

We previously showed that UFMylation, the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-fold modifier UFM1 to proteins, enhances RIG-I signaling by promoting its interaction with its membrane-targeting adaptor 14-3-3{varepsilon}. Here, we map UFM1 conjugation to lysines K50 and K215 on 14-3-3{varepsilon} and demonstrate how these UFMylation events control RIG-I signaling. Using in vitro and cellular UFMylation assays, we reveal that K50R/K215R mutations abolish UFMylation and reduce type I and III interferon induction following RIG-I activation. Unexpectedly, these mutations do not disrupt 14-3-3{varepsilon}-RIG-I interaction. Instead, they paradoxically enhance RIG-I interaction with MAVS while simultaneously reducing 14-3-3{varepsilon}-MAVS interaction. These findings establish UFMylation of 14-3-3{varepsilon} as an important control that shapes MAVS complex architecture to ensure optimal RIG-I signaling and highlights the broader regulatory role of UFMylation in antiviral innate immunity.\n\nImportancePost-translational modifications provide regulatory control of antiviral innate immune responses. Our study reveals that UFMylation of 14-3-3{varepsilon} is required for RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling. We demonstrate that conjugation of UFM1 to specific lysine residues on 14-3-3{varepsilon} enhances downstream signaling events that facilitate interferon induction. It does this by stabilizing 14-3-3{varepsilon} association with the MAVS signaling complex and coordinating productive complex architecture. By identifying the precise sites of UFMylation on 14-3-3{varepsilon} and their functional consequences, we provide insights into the regulatory layers governing antiviral innate immunity.

Antibiotic tolerance, the ability of bacteria to survive exposure to bactericidal concentrations of antibiotics without genetic resistance mutations, contributes to the need for prolonged treatment. Adjunctive targeting of antibiotic tolerance mechanisms could promote accelerated clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), thereby improving medical adherence. Our previous forward genetic screen for rifampin tolerance genes identified pstA1, which is involved in phosphate-specific import. The ABC-type transporter permease PstA1 has previously been implicated in Mtb virulence, as mutants lacking this gene exhibit defective survival during phosphate limitation in vitro, in infected macrophages, and in immunocompetent mice. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of rifampin was not altered in a pstA1 deletion mutant ({Delta}pstA1), suggesting this difference in susceptibility is not due to antibiotic resistance. Consistent with a role in rifampin tolerance, time-kill assays revealed a shift in the mean duration of killing (2-log reduction) from 1.6 days in wild-type to 1.0 day in {triangleup}pstA1, and complementation partially restored this phenotype. We found that pstA1 is specifically required for Mtb survival in the absence of exogenous inorganic phosphate and is important for adaptation to growth in culture without detergent, and within macrophages in an interferon-{gamma}-dependent manner. Differential expression analysis revealed that {Delta}pstA1 exhibited substantial transcriptional reprogramming with 58 differentially expressed genes (49 upregulated and 9 downregulated, adj.

It excels not only in RNA-related perception tasks but also shows strong capability in cross-modal protein-related tasks. On the generation front, NUWA can produce natural-like mRNA sequences and, when provided with a protein sequence, optimize mRNA designs for enhanced codon adaptation index in host organisms. A key advantage of our approach is its adaptability: NUWA can be effectively fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets to generate functional mRNAs with desired properties, without relying on pre-defined biological constraints.

Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that conkazal-M1 adopts a fold characteristic of the Kazal-type protease inhibitor family, featuring a Glu residue at the inhibitory P1 position. Recombinantly expressed conkazal-M1 inhibits the proteolytic activity of Subtilisin A with an apparent Ki of 1.1 M. In addition, conkazal-M1 partially inhibits calcium transients in mouse sensory neurons, suggesting a potential role in modulating ion-channel activity, as seen for many other toxins. The dual function of conkazal-M1 in protease inhibition and neuroactivity is analogous to the dual function of several toxins harboring a Kunitz-type fold. The well-conserved sequence of the MKAVAs indicates an evolutionary trajectory in which these proteins face an adaptive conflict, where mutations that enhance one activity compromise the other.

One general strategy that enhances chemotactic accuracy is the use of self-generated gradients, where cells locally deplete attractants to create or sharpen guidance cues. Here we show that mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) migrate toward the complement component C5a using this strategy. Cells actively deplete C5a from their surroundings, establishing local gradients as fresh attractant diffuses inward. We visualized this process in real time with fluorescent C5a and reproduced its dynamics using computational models. C5a depletion is mediated primarily by C5aR1-dependent endocytosis. This mechanism produces complex responses, with different C5a concentrations inducing temporally distinct waves of migration, and maximal chemotaxis occurring below 10 nM C5a. As expected, increasing C5a concentrations recruit more cells. In contrast, human macrophages inactivate C5a mainly through carboxypeptidase-mediated enzymatic degradation, yielding a higher optimal concentration (~30 nM) and distinct migratory dynamics. Both species also deplete externally imposed C5a gradients, sharpening them and enhancing guidance. These findings identify C5a degradation as a critical mechanism by which macrophages extract directional information from their environment.

In our framework, ontogeny is a nonequilibrium thermodynamic process in which energy is continuously dissipated and redistributed among fluctuating cellular states.

This framework captures both cooperative gating within individual channels and coupling between neighboring channels. Our simulations reveal that the timing of spontaneous Ca sparks is exponentially dependent on the structural integrity of the RyR2 cluster.

Here, we examined responses during old-new recognition and non-mnemonic detection tasks in intensively scanned individuals to directly contrast component processes related to mnemonic familiarity with more general processes associated with target detection. In an oddball detection paradigm devoid of traditional memory demands, SAL/PMN was robustly activated. SAL/PMN was also activated by old words in a standard old-new recognition task, thus reproducing both previously reported effects. In a critical oppositional contrast, recognition was examined when the task was to detect uncommon old words versus when the task was to detect uncommon new words. SAL/PMN was activated during the detection of targets even when those targets were new items, consistent with a response to the task relevance of the targets not mnemonic familiarity.

It has been widely prescribed to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and other neuropsychiatric conditions for decades, but its molecular mode of action in the brain is not fully known. Moreover, prenatal exposure to this drug is linked to developmental anomalies, cognitive deficits, and an increased risk of autism. To determine VPA's effect on the nervous system without requiring systemic drug application and inducing toxic effects, we exploited the well-characterized chemotaxis behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that C. elegans are attracted to VPA, and this behavior is missing in animals lacking the tax-4 ion channel and the tax-4-expressing AWC chemosensory neurons. To test the idea that VPA directly activates the AWC neurons, we performed calcium imaging studies in a line expressing GCaMP6s in all amphid chemosensory neurons in the head. We found that VPA evoked calcium transients consistently in the AWC neurons and variably in AWB and ASH. As cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, the active state of tax-4 increases upon the binding of cGMP. Within the worm's chemosensory nervous system, receptor guanylate cyclases (rGCs) facilitate the synthesis of cGMP and serve as chemoreceptors for various chemical cues. By performing chemotaxis assays and calcium imaging experiments with rGC mutants against VPA, we found that odr-1 and gcy-28 are essential for mediating VPA attraction, as their absence disrupts both behavior and control AWC calcium transients. However, given their broad use in chemosensation, odr-1 and gcy-28 most likely act as downstream effectors rather than as direct targets. These findings compelled us to investigate whether chemoreceptors belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family contribute to VPA sensing. We approached this hypothesis by conducting chemotaxis assays with G mutants and identified several (odr-3, egl-30, gpa-2;gpa-3) whose absence leads to a loss of VPA attraction. Thus, future studies should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which GPCRs contribute to VPA sensing and cGMP signaling.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

SAMP1, also known as Transmembrane Protein 201 (TMEM201), is an inner nuclear membrane protein. Its potential role in metabolic regulation, especially in hepatic glucose production, is entirely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of SAMP1 in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis.\n\nMethodsThe expression of SAMP1 was examined in the livers of diabetic (db/db) mice.

Glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests were performed. Molecular mechanisms were probed using co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and pharmacological inhibition.\n\nResultsHepatic SAMP1 expression was significantly upregulated in db/db mice. Forced overexpression of SAMP1 in hepatocytes enhanced gluconeogenic gene expression (Pck1, G6pc) and glucose output upon glucagon stimulation, and exacerbated hyperglycemia in mice. Conversely, genetic knockdown of SAMP1 attenuated gluconeogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SAMP1 physically interacted with the catalytic subunit of PKA. This interaction facilitated the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB, leading to the transcriptional activation of gluconeogenic genes. The pro-gluconeogenic effect of SAMP1 was abolished by the CREB phosphorylation inhibitor KG-501.\n\nConclusionsOur findings identify the inner nuclear membrane protein SAMP1/TMEM201 as a novel critical enhancer of hepatic gluconeogenesis. It functions as a scaffold that interacts with PKA to potentiate the PKA/CREB signaling cascade. Targeting SAMP1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating excessive hepatic glucose output in T2DM.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

E.; Forster, A.; Caspary, T.", "abstract": "BackgroundPolycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the leading genetic cause of renal failure, resulting in the accumulation of fluid filled cysts and gross enlargement of the kidney. Mutations in PKD1 or PKD2, which encode ciliary polycystin proteins, are the most common cause of PKD. These proteins function in a cilia-dependent cyst activation (CDCA) pathway-one that requires cilia for its pro-cystic function-yet the molecular driver(s) of this pathway are unknown. ARL13B is a regulatory GTPase enriched in cilia with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity and links to renal cystogenesis.\n\nMethodsWe use two distinct Arl13b mouse alleles to investigate whether ARL13B is a component of the CDCA pathway: Arl13bV358A encodes for enzymatically normal ARL13B that is undetectable in cilia, and Arl13bR79Q encodes for cilia-localized ARL13B lacking a residue critical for its GEF activity. We used these alleles in a Pkd1-deficient adult mouse model, and investigated renal morphology (H&E and cystic index analysis), physiology (blood urea nitrogen measurements), renal fibrosis (picrosirius staining and -smooth muscle actin levels), renal injury (SOX9 immunofluorescent staining and quantification), and Wnt signaling ({beta}-catenin and cyclin D1 protein levels).\n\nResultsWe found that loss of ciliary ARL13B or mutating a single residue critical for its GEF activity suppressed Pkd1-dependent cysts. We observed a reduction in kidney size, cystic index, and blood urea nitrogen. We also observed suppression of renal fibrosis, renal injury, and {beta}-catenin and cyclin D1 protein levels.\n\nConclusionsOur results identify a subcellular location and mechanism driving Pkd1-dependent renal cystogenesis.

It has long been assumed that most SpNs undergo extensive postnatal cell death, leaving only a small remnant population that contributes to layer 6b (L6b) in adulthood. However, the extent to which SpNs actually persist as L6b neurons has remained unresolved, partly because previous studies lacked quantitative, whole-cortex analyses that account for postnatal cortical expansion. Here, we performed a comprehensive birthdating analysis using multiple EdU injections spanning the entire neurogenic window of SpNs in mice, combined with whole-neocortex 3D tissue clearing to measure subplate and L6b volumes. This approach allowed us to directly estimate the total number and distribution of SpN-derived neurons in adulthood. We found that most early-born SpNs persist as L6b neurons, and that the apparent postnatal reduction in SpN density reflects tangential cortical expansion rather than neuronal loss. Moreover, surviving SpNs comprise diverse neuronal subtypes reminiscent of those present at early postnatal stages. Together, these findings demonstrate that, in rodents, the majority of adult L6b neurons originate from SpNs, revising the long-held view that the subplate is a largely transient neuronal population.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

E.; Orr, R. J. S.; Gilfillan, G. D.; Dalland, M.; Okstad, O. A.; Voie, O. A.; Rounge, T. B.", "abstract": "Hand hygiene is essential for infection control, yet the impact of frequent antiseptic use on the skin microbiome, which is crucial for skin barrier function and pathogen exclusion, remains underexplored, especially in field conditions. In high-risk military settings, there is a need for safe, multipurpose antiseptics that avoid the drawbacks of alcohol-based options, including skin irritation, flammability, and unsuitability for wound application. We conducted a longitudinal study during the Norwegian-led military exercise Cold Response 2022 to assess the effects of repeated use of stabilized hypochlorous acid, a non-alcoholic antiseptic, on the hand microbiome of soldiers in a field environment. Participants used either the chlorine-based antiseptic (n = 20) or standard hygiene practices, mainly alcohol-based sanitizers (n = 19), for 10 days. Skin swabs from hands and untreated forearms were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and three weeks after discontinuation, and analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Overall, our data revealed that field exposure accounted for more variation in bacterial composition than antiseptic use. When comparing alpha and beta diversity trajectories between the two antiseptic groups, there was minimal divergence during active field use, but a significant post-treatment increase in alpha diversity associated with the use of chlorine-based antiseptic. In contrast, untreated forearms showed no such group-level differences. These findings suggest that antiseptic-driven microbiome shifts are most apparent during recovery, with non-alcoholic formulations supporting faster recolonization after treatment. Stabilized hypochlorous acid represents a promising alternative to standard alcohol-based antiseptics for military personnel.\n\nIMPORTANCEEffective hand hygiene reduces pathogen transmission, but its influence on the skin microbiome has rarely been studied. Our research emphasizes the importance of longitudinal assessments by identifying greater antiseptic-driven differences occurring after cessation of treatment than during repeated use. Service members frequently use antiseptics in challenging environments, highlighting the operational need for a non-alcoholic, multipurpose product that can be safely used on both intact skin and wounds. Our findings suggest that a chlorine-based non-alcoholic antiseptic permits faster recovery of bacterial diversity after perturbation, informing product selection and hygiene policies in defense and other high-risk settings.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

M.; Lappan, R.; Yoon, S.; Wong, W. W.; Cook, P.; Greening, C.", "abstract": "Nearly one-fifth of global emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) originate from the ocean, particularly from nutrient-polluted coastal regions. Permeable (sandy) sediments, which cover half of the continental shelf worldwide, are potential sources of N2O due to increasing nutrient inputs from urbanization and agriculture. Yet, the microbial processes determining N2O emissions in these dynamic and unique ecosystems remain understudied. Here, we combined environmental measurements, bacterial cultivation, and genomic analyses to understand the microbes and processes controlling N2O cycling in permeable sediments from Port Phillip Bay (Australia). We established a genomic resource comprising 249 metagenome-assembled genomes and 95 new isolate genomes. Genome-based metabolic reconstructions and culture-based gas measurements revealed diverse bacteria in these sediments produce N2O through incomplete denitrification pathways. However, these bacteria co-occurred with highly abundant clade II N2O-reducing bacteria from the Flavobacteriaceae family. Kinetic profiling revealed both clade II nosZ flavobacterial isolates and whole sand communities exhibit a low affinity for N2O, contrary to previous reports that clade II N2O reducers generally have a high substrate affinity. This indicates adaptation to the high residence times of N2O within production and consumption zones in the sands. Collectively, these N2O reducers remove most N2O produced in permeable sediments, supporting lower-than-expected coastal emissions predicted by biogeochemical models. We conclude that permeable sediments host specialised microbial communities that mitigate N2O emissions and buffer marine nitrogen cycling amid rising nutrient pollution.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

However, connecting those associations with functional impacts on gene regulatory element activity remains a major challenge. Here, we functionally measured allele-specific regulatory element activity across five human genomes using the genome-wide reporter assay STARR-seq. We identified tens of thousands of gene regulatory elements and estimated allele effects at [~]200,000 genetic variants therein, including [~]10,000 indels in our study population. Allelic effects on regulatory element activity correspond closely with predicted impacts on transcription factor binding motifs. The measured variant effects also allow us to fine map potential causal variants within eQTLs and chromatin QTLs from the same population.

They undergo activity-dependent synaptic plasticity during development and learning, and their transverse branches have an activity-dependent control of mobility. The maintenance of their structure was shown to rely on the growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), which is highly expressed in these fibers under basal conditions in adults and which is controlled by intracellular calcium levels and phosphorylation. Although activity-dependent structural plasticity occurs in several axonal fibers throughout the brain, it remains unclear whether this is also the case for the main branches of CFs. Here, we investigate this issue using in vivo knock-down of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) in the CF-generating neurons of the inferior olive, and analyzing CF three-dimensional morphology, density and function of synaptic contacts with PCs. We show that the decrease in intrinsic excitability causes a reduction in the number and length of CF branches and that similar effects are caused by the knockdown of GAP-43, suggesting that GAP-43 may mediate this response. We also show that the retraction of CF fibers is associated with a seemingly compensatory increase in the density of CF synaptic terminals and PC dendritic spines, specifically in the area where PCs receive CF inputs. These plastic modifications are associated with a decrease in paired-pulse ratio and an increase in the kinetics and transferred charge of synaptic currents. Our data show that CFs can undergo activity-dependent structural plasticity changes affecting synaptic transmission and suggest the possibility that they contribute to encoding memories in the cerebellum and, if disrupted, to the pathophysiology of cerebellar diseases.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Thalamoprefrontal circuitry is central to multiple domains of cognitive control and executive function, yet its evolution during learning is not characterized. In this study, we explored thalamoprefrontal circuit signaling in mice and connectivity dynamics in humans over the course of learning a homologous psychomotor task. In mice, we targeted a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator to the mediodorsal-prefrontal (MdT-dmPFC) projection and used fiber photometry to record synaptic dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) activity. As learning sessions progressed, all mice demonstrated a decrease in reaction time (RT) performance on successful trials (p<0.001). In concomitant synaptic MdT-dmPFC circuit activity across sessions, we observed a significant increase in activity during the anticipatory (p<0.01) and reward retrieval (p<0.01) periods, and a non-significant trend towards an increase in preparatory activity (p<0.15). However, following the learning period, during task re-exposure, we observed a significant shift in circuit activity, away from anticipatory (p<0.001) and towards the preparatory period (p<0.001) over the course of re-exposure sessions. Furthermore, we observed an emergence of a learner (decrease in RT) and a non-learner group (increase in RT) during the task re-exposure period. Over the course of a single analogous task session in humans, we also observed a learner and a non-learner group. When analyzing the thalamoprefrontal regional connectivity dynamics of early and late trials for learners, we observed a significant increase in low frequency and decrease in high frequency synchrony (connectivity tilt) in thalamoprefrontal pathways during preparatory and anticipatory periods. Interestingly, pairwise interactions specifically between the anterior corona radiata (ACR) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the human homolog to the genetically targeted MdT-dmPFC circuitry in mice, in fact demonstrated a robustly opposite connectivity tilt effect distinguishing learners from non-learners (Cohens d > 2).

F.; Curley, J. P.; Hofmann, H.

This study employs single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the amygdalas neuronal responses to olfactory cues associated with social dominance, uncovering distinct activation patterns within glutamatergic and GABAergic populations. We find that a glutamatergic cluster, characterized by expression patterns closely aligned with glutamatergic Slc17a7 (VGLUT1) medial amygdala (MeA) neurons, preferentially responds to dominant cues. In contrast, a larger glutamatergic Slc17a6 (VGLUT2) cluster associated with neurons of the MeA, as well as cortical and basomedial amygdala, exhibits a heightened response to subordinate cues, underscoring the MeA regions role in processing social olfactory information. Additionally, a glutamatergic cluster resembling dorsal endopririform (EPd) neurons responded more to dominant stimuli, supporting the EPds role in olfactory perception. We also identified a GABAergic cluster with elevated dopamine receptor 2 (Drd2) expression that predominantly responds to dominant cues, consistent with this receptors known role in mediating threat responses. Through gene co-expression network analysis, we linked gene expression within neuronal clusters to specific biological processes. These findings reveal distinct neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying social processing, particularly in response to dominant and subordinate olfactory signals, thus enhancing our understanding of the neural substrates of social behavior.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Bassoon is a major scaffolding protein involved in the organization of neurotransmitter release sites at excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory brain synapses. Global deficiency of functional Bassoon causes severe neurological conditions including disturbed patterns of brain activity and early-onset epilepsy. To distinguish the contribution of different types of synapses to this phenotype we generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking the Bsn gene in (i) GABAergic interneurons expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Dlx5/6 regulatory elements (BsnDlx5/6 cKO), (ii) glutamatergic forebrain neurons expressing Cre under the Emx1 promoter (BsnEmx1 cKO), and (iii) dopaminergic neurons expressing DAT-driven Cre (BsnDAT).\n\nMethodsSingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) was employed to assess in vivo brain-wide activation patterns in the cKO mice and corresponding control animals with wildtype Bsn genes. A cortex-dependent learning task to discriminate frequency-modulated tones was then used to evaluate the cognitive abilities of the different cKO lines.\n\nResultsMarked reduction of brain activity was found in various cortical areas and the basolateral amygdala of BsnDlx5/6 cKO mice, while patches of increased activity were detected in the dorsal striatum. BsnEmx1 cKO mice, in contrast, display increased brain activity in many cortical areas. Only minor changes in CBF were detected in BsnDAT cKO mice. Concerning auditory discrimination learning BsnDlx5/6 cKO mice were severely impaired, although they responded to stimuli normally. On the other hand, BsnEmx1 cKO mice acquired the task more efficiently reaching maximum performance levels faster than control animals. Surprisingly, BsnDAT cKO mice did not differ in their behavior from the control group.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest that absence of Bassoon from presynapses of GABAergic interneurons expressing Dlx5/6 gene during development results in severe neurological symptoms and associated dysfunctions.

Yet, how these processes interact with bottom-up frequency-specific stimulus drive, and how they are organised across cortical depth, remains unclear. Using ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (7T fMRI), participants listened to stochastic tone sequences whose repetition structure and predictability varied over time. For each voxel independently, we used computational modelling to estimate responses for stimulus drive, repetition suppression, and expectations. We then partitioned the unique and shared variance of these components to estimate their relative importance in modulating BOLD activity across cortical layers in auditory cortices. Expectation-related signals explained most unique variance in deep (infagranular) layers, in line with accounts that place internal model representations and belief updates in deeper cortical populations. Variance jointly explained by stimulus drive and expectation was instead strongest in superficial layers, consistent with these compartments expressing computations that combine bottom-up input with top-down predictions, such as prediction error signalling. Finally, repetition suppression accounted for variance uniformly across depth, suggesting an adaptation-like mechanism that modulates responsiveness without a clear laminar bias. Together, the data suggest that deep layers contain content-specific predictive models, superficial layers register prediction-input alignment, and repetition suppression provides a depth-invariant, local gain control that complements predictive processing.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

In vivo measurements demonstrate remarkable spine dynamics, with subsets of synapses persisting for months. This correlates with the extreme longevity of certain memories, which can persist for an organisms lifetime. The molecular basis supporting the long-term stability of specific synapses and the long-term durability of memories remains unknown. At the protein level, most proteins persist for a relatively short amount of time before they are degraded and replaced with new molecules. However, recent work has identified a population of proteins, including those present at the synapse, that are exceptionally long-lived. It has been speculated that long-lived proteins (LLPs) could contribute to long-term synapse stability, function, and memory. Here, we used stable isotope labeling in mammals (SILAM) to first identify LLPs in the post synaptic density (PSD) of the hippocampus and subsequently determine if protein turnover rates varied by sex or following learning. We identified novel synaptic LLPs and found that both sex and experience can regulate synaptic protein turnover rates. We identified sex-dependent changes in protein turnover rates in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes, including increased stability of Gabrg2, a GABA-A receptor subunit, in male mice. Furthermore, we observed stabilization of a subset of PSD proteins, such as Shank3, following contextual fear conditioning. We propose that sex and experience dependent changes in protein turnover rates could help explain sex-differences in psychiatric risk and aid our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that support learning and memory.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

We resolve previous controversies by showing that Wnt3a triggers rapid Clathrin-Mediated and Fast Endophilin-Mediated LRP6 endocytosis at low concentrations sufficient for Wnt activation. This efficient endocytosis requires Ena/VASP proteins and is specifically promoted by Mena. Our results suggest Mena as a crucial mediator of Wnt signalosome endocytosis thus promoting canonical Wnt signalling.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Traditional models suggest that AAV escapes from endosomes via membrane disruption, but direct evidence for this process are lacking. Here, we show that AAVR, the essential AAV cell entry receptor, functions as a bona fide retromer cargo. Using in vitro reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that AAVRs cytosolic tail is sufficient to engage the SNX3-retromer complex and drive membrane tubulation, a hallmark of retrograde trafficking. In AAVR-knockout HuH-7 cells, AAV2 particles are internalized but fail to reach the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and support transgene expression. Galectin-8 recruitment assays reveal no evidence of endosomal membrane rupture during productive transduction, distinguishing AAV2 from lytic vectors such as lipid nanoparticles. Moreover, VP1u-deficient and PLA2-mutant AAV2 capsids accumulate at the TGN, indicating that VP1u is dispensable for early trafficking but required for post-TGN progression toward productive transduction. These findings challenge the prevailing model of direct endosomal escape and position AAV transduction as a vesicle-guided, receptor-mediated process.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

CW integrity is monitored by transmembrane sensors that activate downstream effectors to promote CW synthesis in response to injuries. Sensors of the WSC family are found in most fungi, and share a conserved architecture, with a cytoplasmic tail, a single transmembrane domain and a long Serine Threonine Rich domain (STR) prolonged by a WSC domain, both embedded in the CW. In response to forces applied onto the CW, these extracellular domains promote force detection, sensor clustering and cell survival. Interestingly, Wsc sensors exhibit variations in domain sequence and size among different fungal species. To understand how these variations impact mechanosensing, we heterologously expressed Wsc sensors taken from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, in the fission yeast S. pombe. Remarkably, we found that a subset of these foreign sensors could cluster at sites of CW compression, but that others failed, suggesting divergences in mechanosensing abilities.

Signals from their environment can lead macrophages to adapt distinct functional phenotypes, a process called polarization. Because macrophages have been previously shown to degrade the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C upon pro-inflammatory polarization, and lamins are considered key determinants of nuclear deformability, which is important for cellular functions including migration through confined environments, we aimed to address the effect of pro-inflammatory stimulation on nuclear mechanics. We present the surprising finding that polarized bone marrow-derived macrophages have less deformable nuclei than unpolarized macrophages, despite their reduced lamin A/C levels. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory macrophages exhibited altered chromatin dynamics relative to unpolarized macrophages, including redistribution of trimethylated histone H3K9 (H3K9me3) from the nuclear periphery to the interior and increased chromatin compaction. Our findings suggest a model in which pro-inflammatory stimulation of macrophages induces chromatin changes that drive nuclear stiffening, and that in these cells, chromatin, rather than the nuclear lamina, is the major driver for resisting nuclear deformation. These findings may have functional relevance for the physiological function of polarized macrophages, as the mechanical properties of the nucleus can influence how these cells adapt and respond to their environments in the context of cell migration or inflammatory disease pathologies.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Yet, distinguishing adaptive gene expression shifts from neutral divergence remains challenging. Here, we integrate comparative transcriptomics and regulatory genomics to investigate how natural selection has shaped gene expression in African mole-rats, a group of subterranean rodents with phenotypic adaptations to underground environments. Using RNA-seq from liver and heart in two mole-rat species (naked mole-rat and Damaraland mole-rat) and two rodent outgroups (mouse and guinea pig), we leveraged phylogenetic models of expression evolution and identified hundreds of genes whose transcriptional levels have experienced accelerated evolution in each tissue and mole-rat species. These lineage-specific shifts account for only a small fraction of gene expression differences identified by classical differential expression analysis between species, underscoring the importance of phylogeny-aware inference to disentangle accelerated evolution from drift. To connect expression divergence with regulatory evolution, we integrated transcriptomic profiles with cis-regulatory landscapes. Genes with lineage-specific expression shifts displayed concordant changes in cis-regulatory activity, particularly at promoters, and the magnitude of expression divergence increased with the number of shifted cis-regulatory elements. Our results demonstrate that adaptive shifts in mole-rat gene expression are mirrored by regulatory evolution, providing genome-wide coordinated evidence of accelerated evolution on expression and regulation during mammalian evolution.

In the barrier axis, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells exhibited reduced junction-related gene expression and broad alterations in transport pathways. Epithelial cells also showed late-stage cilia loss and CSF-regulatory pathway impairment, indicating a breakdown in epithelial polarity and CSF sensing, consistent with abnormal CSF proteomic signatures.

Using transcriptomic data from the BioVacSafe consortium encompassing seven vaccines and immunostimulants in mice and five licensed vaccines in humans, we developed a cross-compartment and cross-species predictive model of vaccine reactogenicity. Reactogenicity classes were defined in mouse muscle based on the magnitude of transcriptomic responses and literature evidence. A penalized ordinal regression model was trained to predict both discrete classes and continuous scores of reactogenicity. Transcriptomic profiles from mouse muscle were highly predictive of reactogenicity, with key genes enriched in inflammatory and tissue repair pathways such as IL6/JAK/STAT3 signalling. The model retained strong performance when transferred to mouse blood and revealed shared transcriptional programs between compartments, suggesting coordinated innate responses. When applied to human blood, the classifier correctly ranked licensed vaccines by reactogenicity, identifying Fluad (MF59-adjuvanted) as the most reactogenic, in agreement with elevated C-reactive protein and ReactoScore values, while Engerix-B, Varilrix, and Stamaril were classified as low-reactogenicity formulations.

When the basal geometry is modulated, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells adjust their morphology to maintain an overall apical flatness of the confluent layer. Pharmacological and transgenic disruption of non-muscle myosin ATPase, and MLCK activity results in an uneven apical structure, and overall loss of the flat geometry typical of a confluent epithelium. Surprisingly, transgenic experimentation showed that forces maintaining individual MDCK cell flatness are cell-autonomous. Finally, Ca2+ imaging reveals an asynchronous calcium flux across a confluent epithelium, suggesting a myosin II-mediated mechanism for maintaining a flat apical architecture. Our results highlight that apical/basal cellular surfaces may not be tightly coordinated, but rather independently regulated.

We found that temperature stress impeded the evolution of traits important for antagonistic interactions in both species. Prey defense levels as well as predators' ability to eat prey were limited under temperature stress.

Micropillars (5 m diameter) were fabricated using focused ion beam milling on femur cross-sections in regions of matrix formed either before or after changes in the microbiome (16 weeks) (n = 4/group). Proteomics was used to identify differences in matrix protein composition. Micropillar fracture toughness differed by group (p < 0.001) and region (p < 0.001). Fracture toughness in the Unaltered group (1.34 {+/-} 0.32 MPa{surd}m, mean {+/-} SD) was substantially greater than the Continuous group (0.95 {+/-} 0.20) and the Delayed group (0.90 {+/-} 0.21) but not different from the Reconstituted group (1.22 {+/-}0.25). Bone matrix formed from 16-24 weeks of age had lower fracture toughness than matrix formed before 16 weeks of age in all groups.

Here, we introduce Cis-TERN (Cis-Temporally Encoded Regulation Network), a graph-based method that integrates single-cell measurements of gene expression (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) to infer a pseudotime ordering of cells. Exploiting the fact that distal cis chromatin accessibility often precedes gene activation, Cis-TERN builds a directed bipartite graph between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq cells with edge weights determined by either proximal or distal accessibility. Through network diffusion, Cis-TERN assigns continuous pseudotime scores to all cells. Cis-TERN infers cellular pseudotime without the need for prior biological knowledge, such as specifying a root cell type, thereby enabling unbiased reconstruction of differentiation from data alone.

MAIT cells are innate-like T cells enriched in mucosal tissues, possess potent antibacterial activity, and restoration of their function may offer a host-directed strategy against drug-resistant pathogens. We evaluated how stimulation with cognate antigen in combination with various cytokines, modulates MAIT cell cytotoxicity and enhances carbapenem activity. Under optimal conditions, MAIT cells exhibited increased expression of antimicrobial cytolytic proteins and efficiently killed cells pulsed with MAIT cell antigen. IL-15 or IL-2 plus IL-7 were particularly effective in promoting polyfunctional cytotoxic responses. Secretomes from cytokine-stimulated MAIT cells restored the activity of imipenem against engineered E. coli expressing the clinically relevant carbapenemases blaNDM-1, blaKPC-2, and blaOXA-48, strongly reducing bacterial growth, viability, and metabolic activity. Notably, IL-2 plus IL-7 stimulation enabled expansion and functional restoration of MAIT cells from HAI patients, whose baseline MAIT cell numbers and responses were diminished. These findings demonstrate that tailored stimulation can reinvigorate MAIT cell effector function and augment antibiotic efficacy, supporting a role for MAIT cells in adjunct immunotherapeutic strategy to combat AMR in vulnerable patient populations.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

However, designing an end-to-end framework capable of directly leveraging extremely high-dimensional genotypic data while simultaneously mitigating overfitting and ensuring robust prediction remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce PRSNet-2, an interpretable end-to-end deep learning framework designed to predict complex phenotypes directly from large-scale genotypic data. PRSNet-2 proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) architecture, which first employs a multi-kernel aggregator to map high-dimensional genotypic features to gene-level representations. Next, it models gene-gene interactions through message-passing operations and uses an attention-based readout module to generate interpretable phenotypic predictions. We further introduce significance-guided regularization strategies to boost model's generalizability based on prior genetic associations. Extensive empirical evaluations across multiple complex traits and diseases demonstrate that PRSNet-2 consistently outperforms a variety of baseline methods and exhibits superior capabilities in overcoming overfitting, even when modeling around half a million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Moreover, PRSNet-2 is shown to be easily extendable to integrate multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets into a single model, thereby enhancing predictive performance for both single-phenotype and multi-phenotype prediction tasks. The inherent interpretability of PRSNet-2 further facilitates the identification of disease-relevant genes, functional gene modules, and potential therapeutic targets.

Although recent protein language models and structure-aware methods can capture spatial information of tertiary structure when generating residue embeddings, most existing epitope predictors use these embeddings to perform classification for individual residues one by one, without enforcing spatial continuity for reported epitope residues. Such methods often result in biologically implausible predictions because B-cell epitope residues always cluster together on the antigen surface. Results: We present RoBep, a region-oriented B-cell epitope predictor that explicitly models the spatial clustering of epitope residues.

We introduce STELAR-X, a highly scalable triplet-based phylogenetic inference algorithm that achieves an asymptotically optimal memory complexity of O(nk) for n species and k gene trees--essentially matching the input size and allowing analyses to remain feasible as long as the input trees fit in memory--while also substantially reducing running time. STELAR-X achieves this by a comprehensive re-engineering of the underlying data structures and algorithms. We introduce a novel, compact integer tuple-based encoding of tree bipartitions and efficient procedures for rapid pre-computation of bipartition weights. We further leverage GPU parallelism for fast pre-computation of necessary weights. This improved and redesigned computational framework underpins a dynamic programming algorithm with substantially reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STELAR-X achieves unprecedented scalability. On simulated datasets with 10,000 taxa and 1,000 gene trees, STELAR-X runs 712x faster than ASTRAL-MP (the most scalable variant of ASTRAL) while using 7.5x less CPU memory.

To address these limitations, we develop STcompare, a statistical framework for comparative analysis of ST data by testing for differences in spatial correlation and spatial fold-change across structurally matched locations. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how STcompare provides distinct insights from bulk differential gene expression analysis and robustly controls for false positives even in the presence of spatial autocorrelation common in ST data.

This requires resolving spatial correspondences between slices while capturing shared transcriptomic features, two tasks that are typically addressed in isolation. Multi-slice analysis remains challenging due to physical distortions, technical variability, and batch effects. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Alignment and Deep Embedding for multi-slice SRT (JADE), a unified computational framework that simultaneously learns spatial location-wise alignments and shared low-dimensional embeddings across tissue slices. Unlike existing methods, JADE adopts a roundtrip framework in which each iteration alternates between alignment and embedding refinement. To infer alignment, we employ attention mechanisms that dynamically assess and weight the importance of different embedding dimensions, allowing the model to focus on the most alignment-relevant features while suppressing noise. To the best of our knowledge, JADE is the first method that jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning in a shared latent space, enabling robust multi-slice integration. We demonstrate that JADE outperforms existing alignment and embedding methods across multiple evaluation metrics in the 10x Visium human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and Stereo-seq axolotl brain datasets.

K.; Garai, K.", "abstract": "Aberrant liquid-to-solid transition (LST) of tau is a pathological hallmark of several tauopathies, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE4 is a major genetic risk factor for AD and has been shown to exacerbate tau pathology, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we investigate whether apoE isoforms can influence amyloid aggregation of tau occurring via the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) pathway by monitoring individual tau condensates in real time using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and confocal microscopy. We find that interaction of apoE with tau condensates is dependent on the lipidation status of apoE. Lipid-free apoE, even at 1:1000 substoichiometric concentrations, arrests growth but promotes ageing of the liquid condensates of tau. The strong effect of apoE is accompanied by its preferential accumulation inside the condensates, lowering of the surface tension and promoting amyloid nucleation. Lipidation of apoE2 and apoE3 diminished its amyloid promoting effects very strongly. However, apoE4 even in the lipidated forms accelerated the liquid to amyloid conversion of the tau condensates considerably. Furthermore, the amyloidogenic effect of apoE4 is correlated with its higher delipidation tendency compared to apoE2 and apoE3. Together, our study suggests that lipid free apoE promotes tau aggregation via dual mechanisms by increasing condensate surface to volume ratio and by facilitating amyloid nucleation possibly at the condensate interfaces. We hypothesize that enhancing apoE4 lipidation in vivo presents a potential strategy to counteract its pathogenic effects on tau aggregation.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

First, we observed that patients who experienced CAR-T cell-related CRS have elevated serum BAFF levels that coincide with elevated IL-6.

Neutralization of BAFF with belimumab significantly reduces production of various CRS and ICANS-related cytokines without impairing CAR-T cell activation or killing.

However, as seen with other first generation KRAS inhibitors, resistance may limit their long-term efficacy, necessitating combination strategies to enhance therapeutic outcomes. Exportin 1 (XPO1), a nuclear transport protein overexpressed in PDAC, represents a therapeutic vulnerability in KRAS-mutant cancers. Here, we demonstrate that the second-generation XPO1 inhibitor Eltanexor synergizes with MRTX1133 to enhance its efficacy in multiple PDAC models. Methods: We generated KRASG12Di-resistant PDAC cells and assessed their response to Eltanexor. The antiproliferative effects of MRTX1133 and Eltanexor combinations were evaluated in 2D and 3D in vitro PDAC models. The in vivo efficacy of the combination was tested in KRASG12D-mutant human and murine PDAC xenograft and allograft models. Results: Eltanexor sensitized MRTX1133-resistant PDAC cells to growth inhibition. In both 2D and 3D culture models, the combination of Eltanexor and MRTX1133 significantly reduced cell viability. Mechanistically, the combination treatment suppressed key KRAS downstream signaling molecules, including p-ERK, mTOR, p-4EBP1, DUSP6, and cyclin D1. Kinome analysis further revealed reduced MAPK-related kinase activity. Combining subtherapeutic doses of Eltanexor and MRTX1133 resulted in significant tumor regression and prolonged survival in PDAC xenograft and immunocompetent orthotopic allograft models.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently amplified or mutated in GBM, and we have previously shown that different EGFR statuses correlate with distinct tumor phenotypes and responses to temozolomide (TMZ). In this study, we investigated the differential response of two mouse GBM models, one overexpressing EGFRwt (EGFRwt/amp) and the other with overexpressing the EGFRvIII variant, to radiotherapy (RT) alone and in combination with TMZ. While both tumor models were sensitive to RT in vitro, in vivo experiments showed no significant survival benefit from RT for mice carrying EGFRwt/amp GBM, regardless of the RT schedule. Moreover, for these tumors, different combinations of RT with TMZ were not significantly better than spaced TMZ treatment alone. In contrast, EGFRvIII tumors responded well to RT alone, and spacing out the RT doses offered no additional benefit. Although a Stupp-like protocol provided a small benefit compared to RT alone in this model, the combinatorial treatment also induced the expression of several resistance markers, such as MGMT or NF-kb phosphorylation. Our retrospective analysis of patient data supports these findings, suggesting that RT alone may not improve survival for patients with EGFRwt/amp GBM, whereas for GBM with EGFRvIII mutations, adding RT or TMZ and RT, does provide a clear survival benefit to surgery or to surgery and RT, respectively. These results suggest that EGFR status could serve as a crucial biomarker to predict tumor response and guide personalized treatment decisions, particularly in cases where minimizing toxicity is a priority.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Beyond their classical activity-dependent release of their neuropeptide cargo into the systemic circulation, these neurons also release AVP somatodendritically, enabling local modulation of neuronal excitability and vascular tone. We previously showed that a systemic salt challenge triggers inverse neurovascular coupling (iNVC) in the SON, in which activity-dependent dendritic AVP release induces parenchymal arteriole vasoconstriction and local hypoxia. In rats with heart failure (HF), however, the polarity of this salt-evoked response is reversed: microglia-derived adenosine acting on A2A receptors overrides an enhanced AVP-mediated vasoconstriction, producing net vasodilation. Still, whether AVP activation by non-osmotic stimuli engages similar neurovascular mechanisms is unknown. Here, we examined whether hypovolemia induced by intraperitoneal polyethylene glycol (PEG) evokes comparable vascular responses in control and HF rats. PEG produced a sustained rise in plasma protein concentration and vasoconstriction of SON parenchymal arterioles in both control and sham rats. In HF rats, PEG still induced vasoconstriction at 60 min, but vascular diameters returned to baseline by 90 min despite persistent hypovolemia. These findings indicate that hypovolemia engages a conserved AVP-mediated iNVC program that remains largely intact in HF, and that the previously described polarity reversal during HF is stimulus-specific, emerging during osmotic but not hypovolemic activation of AVP neurons.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

When cultured in defined media previously shown to stabilize naive pluripotency in human ESCs, sESCs adopted dome-shaped colony morphology, maintained OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG expression, retained differentiation potential, and exhibited a transcriptomic profile consistent with resetting to an intermediate pluripotent state with naive-like morphological features.

To overcome these problems, we introduce eccDNAMamba, a bidirectional state space model (SSM) built upon the Mamba-2 framework, which scales linearly with input sequence length and enables scalable modeling of ultra-long eccDNA sequences. eccDNAMamba further incorporates a circular augmentation strategy to preserve the intrinsic circular topology of eccDNA.

However, measured signals are affected by tissue autofluorescence (AF), which can confound molecular quantifications at the single-cell level. Existing computational strategies to subtract AF are not sensitive nor specific enough and often leave residual background or over subtract weak markers. To address current limitations, we introduce CLEAR-AF (Coordinate-transformed Local Estimation and Adaptive Removal of AutoFluorescence), a subtraction framework where AF is calibrated for each acquired signal using a reference image. CLEAR-AF maps these intensities into polar coordinates to disentangle AF from true signal, and applies adaptive, distribution-aware thresholding to estimate and remove AF locally. Across multiple cMIF technologies, CLEAR-AF yields cleaner marker channels with improved specificity, greater sensitivity, and higher reproducibility relative to common AF removal approaches. By delivering more accurate per-cell measurements without workflow changes to acquisition, CLEAR-AF provides a practical, platform-agnostic step towards more reliable spatial proteomics at scale.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Tensor decompositions offer a powerful framework for the unsupervised analysis of such data, yielding interpretable low-dimensional temporal patterns. However, existing approaches based on the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model assume common temporal dynamics for all subjects and therefore cannot capture subject-specific trajectories. Results: To address this limitation, we propose to use the PARAFAC2 model, a more flexible tensor decomposition method to explicitly model subject-specific variations, such as shifts and delays in temporal patterns. Through systematic comparisons on simulated and real-world datasets--including studies of infant gut maturation and dietary interventions--we demonstrate that PARAFAC2 outperforms CP in capturing subject-specific temporal trajectories, and enables the discovery of biologically relevant patterns that are overlooked by CP. Furthermore, we introduce replicability as a robust criterion for selecting the number of components and demonstrate that the extracted patterns are replicable.

The Jumonji-C (JmjC)-only sub-family of 2OG-oxygenases catalyse the hydroxylation of protein and tRNA substrates involved in fundamental cellular processes. Jumonji-domain 5 (JMJD5) is a highly conserved and essential 2OG-oxygenase that, thus far, is the only arginyl hydroxylase assigned in eukaryotes. We recently reported that JMJD5 hydroxylase activity is required for DNA replication fidelity, and that pathogenic variants cause replication stress (RS) and genome instability (GIN) in a novel neurodevelopmental disorder. Because of the prevalence of RS and GIN in cancer, and reported roles of JMJD5 in tumorigenesis, we here investigate the impact of JMJD5 cancer mutations on its role in replication fidelity. We describe the structural impact of cancer missense mutations on the hydroxylase activity of JMJD5 and its interaction with RCCD1, an abundant binding partner encoded by a gene associated with susceptibility to a variety of tumour types. We show that the JMJD5:RCCD1 interaction is disrupted by cancer mutations and that the complex is essential for suppressing RS and GIN in tumour cells. Finally, we describe a novel interaction of the complex with RAD51 paralogues and demonstrate the importance of the JMJD5:RCCD1 interaction for normal replication fork restart. Our findings further highlight the importance of protein hydroxylases in fundamental cellular processes and the consequences of JMJD5 and RCCD1 deregulation in human disease.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Andrographis paniculata treatment provided partial neuroprotection. Metformin demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects by reducing hyperglycemia, preventing weight loss, and preserving neuronal structure. Combination therapy suggested potential synergistic effects, showing improvements in blood glucose, body weight, brain weight, cerebral morphology, and histochemistry. Increased synaptophysin expression and reduced astrocyte activation via GFAP expression were observed with combination therapy.

R.", "abstract": "Emotion regulation enables individuals to modulate emotional experiences and behaviors according to situational demands. Within attachment theory, individual differences in attachment anxiety and avoidance are conceived as interpersonal dispositions that influence the quality and efficiency of emotion regulation strategies, potentially shaping the underlying neural dynamics. This study examined cortical oscillatory activity during two regulation strategies-cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression-focusing on theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) bands at the source level. Forty adults (21 male, 18 female, 1 gender-unspecified; M = 27.58 years, SD = 8.71) performed an emotion regulation task involving emotionally evocative images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while EEG was recorded. Cortical sources were reconstructed using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) assessed the effects of condition, region of interest (ROI), and attachment orientations on oscillatory power. Results showed that higher attachment anxiety predicted reduced theta power in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during reappraisal, indicating attenuated recruitment of cognitive control mechanisms. In the beta band, suppression reduced activity in the right parietal lobe/precuneus - a region involved in self-referential and attentional processes - across participants, while during reappraisal, attachment anxiety was linked to lower beta power and attachment avoidance to higher beta power in the left dlPFC. Together, these findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression engage distinct cortical oscillatory systems, and that interpersonal dispositions modulate their neural implementation. Frontal theta appears to index top-down control during reappraisal, whereas beta activity shows a dual pattern: frontal beta variations reflect differences in control stability associated with attachment orientations, and parietal beta decreases during suppression suggest attentional disengagement from self-referential processing.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

While their neural interconnections are well characterized, the organization and functional significance of their shared vascular network remain poorly understood. Here, we used in vivo two-photon microscopy in rats, combined with fluorescent vascular labeling and retrograde neuronal tracing, to visualize and quantify blood flow within the AP-NTS microcirculation. We identified direct capillary connections between the two regions, confirming a continuous vascular network previously inferred from ex vivo studies. Analysis of red blood cell trajectories revealed that blood flow across these junctions is predominantly unidirectional, from the NTS toward the AP. Morphometric measurements showed that AP capillaries are nearly twice the diameter of those in the NTS, implying a lower local vascular resistance and providing a structural basis for this directionality. Despite these geometric differences, capillary flow velocities were similar between regions, consistent with active regulation that maintains stable perfusion dynamics. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized, functionally asymmetric vascular pathway within the dorsal medulla. By enabling the directed transfer of diffusible neurohumoral signals from the NTS to the AP, this specialized microvascular network adds a novel layer of communication between two key brainstem autonomic centers and may represent an additional mechanism for the integration of visceral and circulating information.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

The molecular programs underlying these age-specific immune differences remain poorly understood. Methods: We performed single-cell multi-omics profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 29 AD patients and 29 matched healthy controls (HC), spanning pediatric (0-17 years), adult (18-59 years), and geriatric (60 years and older) groups. Using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), we simultaneously quantified transcriptomic (RNA) and surface proteomic (ADT) profiles across approximately 280,000 immune cells. Integrated analyses identified 30 immune subsets for cell-type proportion and differential expression analyses. Machine-learning classifiers were trained on significant gene and protein features to distinguish AD subgroups by age. Results: Compared with HC, AD blood showed enrichment of CD14+ monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and CD4+ proliferating T cells. Within AD, pediatric patients had increased gamma-delta T cells, naive CD4+, and naive CD8+ T cells, while geriatric patients exhibited more CD4+ cytotoxic and CD8+ central memory T cells, indicating a shift from naive to effector predominance with aging. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed distinct programs: pediatric AD was enriched for IL-10 and cytokine-to-cytokine receptor signaling; adult AD showed activation of metabolic and NF-kappaB, Th1, and Th17 pathways; and geriatric AD exhibited reduced adaptive immune activity but increased innate signaling. Machine-learning models based on differentially expressed genes and proteins accurately classified AD age groups (transcript-based F1 = 0.70, AUC = 0.79), identifying stable markers such as IRF2, PDK4, ZFP90, CD21, CD94, and CD122. Conclusions: Single-cell multi-omics profiling revealed immune differences across the AD lifespan, transitioning from developmental tolerance in children to inflammatory and metabolic activation in adults to enhanced innate signaling in geriatric individuals.

However, effective implementation of such conservation strategies often relies on a comprehensive understanding of host health, which can be directly influenced by the gut microbiome, yet characterization of gut microbiota often remains overlooked in ex situ conservation facilities. Additionally, effects on the gut microbiome associated with releasing zoo-reared animals into the wild are poorly understood. Therefore, these circumstances make hellbenders an ideal species to examine the relationship between zoo management strategies and gut microbial dynamics. Methods: 16S rRNA sequencing was used to investigate dissimilarities between the gut microbiome of hellbenders in zoo and wild settings and to evaluate the impact of implementing a wild diet in zoo-reared hellbenders. Additionally, the bacterial composition of zoo-released individuals and wild resident hellbenders was compared to examine the response of the gut microbiome upon release into natural habitat. Selected samples were also chosen for ITS1 rDNA sequencing as a preliminary investigation of the hellbender gut mycobiome. Results: Human rearing strongly affected the gut microbiome, leading to reduced bacterial richness as well as differing community structure than wild hellbenders. However, implementation of a wild diet in a zoo setting modulated the microbiome and appeared to be mainly driven by bacterial turnover. Additionally, both bacterial and fungal gut assemblages demonstrated the capacity for restructuring upon release into native habitat to become more reflective of a wild-type microbiome. Conclusions: We completed the first study elucidating the gut microbial composition patterns of hellbenders, across both zoo and wild settings. These results provide an understanding of the potential impacts of conservation populations in zoos on gut microbial communities and also inform headstart programs of the transition of the gut microbiome post-reintroduction to the wild.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

However, significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes exists even among patients with MSI cancers of the same type, suggesting the presence of distinct molecular subtypes and the need for more personalized biomarkers. The systematic exploration of this heterogeneity is currently hindered by the lack of a specialized, multi-dimensional data resource. This raises a critical scientific question: building upon the established link between MSI status and therapeutic efficacy, how can we leverage a multi-dimensional, deeply curated data resource to precisely characterize the molecular heterogeneity of MSI cancers and discover personalized biomarkers for precision oncology? Methods To address this question, we developed the Microsatellite Instability Cancer Knowledgebase (MSICKB). We systematically curated MSI-related data from 492 publications spanning from 1997 to 2024, covering 31 cancer types. The curated data encompasses four key dimensions: Genetic & Molecular Features, Clinicopathological Features, Therapeutic Response, and Prognostic Factors. Furthermore, we constructed and analyzed a comprehensive gene-disease network to systematically characterize the molecular landscape of MSI cancers. Results MSICKB(http://www.sysbio.org.cn/MSICKB/) curates a total of 1,382 MSI-related features from 492 publications, covering 31 cancer types. The knowledgebase includes four major categories: Genetic & Molecular Features, Clinicopathological Features, Prognostic Factors, and Therapeutic Response. An application analysis of the curated data revealed that the constructed gene-disease network exhibits a scale-free-like topology, indicating a hierarchical organization governed by a few highly connected hub nodes. Further investigation of the 14 identified hub genes showed significant functional enrichment in core MSI-related pathways, including DNA mismatch repair, immune checkpoint regulation, and key oncogenic signaling pathways. Conclusion MSICKB provides an integrated, multi-dimensional data resource that facilitates the exploration of the molecular heterogeneity landscape and common regulatory principles within MSI cancers. It serves as a valuable platform for identifying novel molecular subtypes and biomarkers. In the future, the continuous evolution of MSICKB will support the development of clinical prediction models, assist in the advancement of intelligent medicine, and ultimately promote the progress of precision diagnostics and therapeutics for MSI cancers.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Through an integrated bioinformatics analysis of the GEO database, we identified Tropomyosin 4 (TPM4) as a differentially expressed gene in ATC. Bioinformatic correlation and pathway enrichment analyses suggested that TPM4 expression is potentially linked to tumor cell invasion and lymph node metastasis. We showed that TPM4 was highly expressed in both ATC tissues and cell lines, and its expression levels were positively correlated with enhanced cell migration and invasion.

Early chronotypes (ECs) exhibit superior motor and cognitive functions in the morning, whereas late chronotypes (LCs) tend to perform better in the evening. However, previous studies have examined these patterns under socially imposed nighttime sleep schedules, without considering individuals' preferred sleep timing. Thus, it remains unclear whether these chronotype-dependent performance peaks persist when individuals follow their preferred sleep schedules. To address this question, we measured subjective states, sleep pressure (using electroencephalography), and motor and cognitive functions at 1.5 and 12.5 hours after awakening under two conditions: the Clock-Time condition (10:30 PM - 6:30 AM sleep aligned with social rhythms) and the Self-Time condition (8 hours of sleep aligned with individual preferences). The results revealed distinct chronotype-specific patterns. ECs exhibited increases in fatigue and sleepiness dependent on awake duration, showing typical sleep pressure accumulation . LCs were more affected by sleep timing and showed atypical patterns of sleep pressure accumulation compared with ECs. Motor ability tended to improve in the afternoon in both chronotypes, irrespective of sleep-wake schedule, whereas cognitive performance peaked at different stages of wakefulness -earlier for ECs and later for LCs- independent of the time of day. These findings suggest that chronotype-aligned sleep-wake schedules could help optimize fatigue management, cognitive performance, and motor control. Diurnal variations in performance cannot be attributed to clock time alone but emerge from the combined effects of chronotype, awake duration, and sleep-wake regulation.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

A partial least squares regression model predicted 97% of variation in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic NIR reflectance was attributed primarily to the increase in spongy mesophyll thickness and overall leaf thickness in symptomatic tissue. Water infiltration of the intercellular airspaces in symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves removed differences in NIR reflectance, supporting a mechanistic link between increased NIR reflectance and the foliar symptoms of BLD. Our results highlight the interaction of leaf internal architecture with NIR wavelengths, and informs the development of targeted remote sensing tools, with implications for detecting even early-stage symptoms of BLD.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

The oxidation of lipids by ROS produces 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a highly reactive aldehyde that forms adducts with proteins and thereby impacts immune signaling. In this study, using blood samples from patients with sepsis at the emergency department, collected by the Acutelines data- and biobank, we show that 4-HNE selectively suppresses the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, while pro-inflammatory IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- are unaffected. Mechanistically, 4-HNE causes a pronounced transcriptional reorganization, leading to metabolic reprogramming and activation of HIF-1 signaling. In turn, this suppresses IL-10 production through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-{kappa}B) signaling, whereas IL-6 and TNF- are unaffected due to increased activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. This suppression likely occurs in sepsis, because, whereas overall 4-HNE protein adduct levels are increased in blood samples of sepsis patients, they are decreased in monocytes and T cells and negatively correlate with IL-10 levels. Thus, our data show that 4-HNE selectively suppresses IL-10 production in sepsis. This is likely relevant to the clinical outcome of sepsis patients because IL-10 levels correlate with mortality.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

In patients, the most common variant in the Npc1 gene is a missense mutation that leads to a misfolded and non-functional NPC1 protein. We used a mouse model carrying this mutation (I1061T, Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso) to investigate the olfactory system since olfaction is often negatively impacted in many neurodegenerative disorders, with olfactory decline frequently preceding other neurodegenerative symptoms. We characterized cell types in the olfactory epithelium (OE) in wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice to analyze neurodegeneration at two time points, namely 36 and 60 days after birth. In homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice the density of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) at 36 days after birth is decreased compared to wild type and heterozygous mice while the density of immature OSNs and the stem cell niche seems to not be affected. In the OE of the homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice we found an increased density of apoptotic cells and clear sign of neuroinflammation in macrophage/microglia infiltrating the OE. We analyzed the lipid profile of OE by positive MALDI-TOF and found increased markers of neuroinflammation homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice. These structural changes affected the functionality of the OE since we found reduced odorant responses in Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice compared to wild type. Additionally, our olfactory behavioral tests revealed deficits in odor-guided food-seeking tests in Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso but not in the wild type and heterozygous mice. We also analyzed the olfactory abilities of a family of three with the parents carrying two different mutations of the Npc1 gene, with the child carrying both mutations and being diagnosed with NPC1 disease. Using the Sniffin Sticks olfactory test, we found that all three were hyposmic with the child having severe hyposmia. Our work extensively characterized the OE structurally and functionally proposing it as a sentinel to monitor disease progression.

Rp was estimated by contrasting net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation under ambient and O2-free conditions at three leaf temperatures (25, 30, and 35{degrees}C), encompassing typical and heatwave scenarios. Results reveal pronounced interspecific variation in Rp and increasing photorespiration with temperature, consistent with the temperature sensitivity of Rubisco's oxygenase function.

However, the physiological role of this process remains unclear. Building on recent evidence that environmental stress determines bacterial Mn(II) oxidation activity, we used Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a known Mn(II)-oxidizing bacterium, to investigate the potential drivers and benefits of this reaction. Using RNA-seq, we observed up-regulation of starvation-related two-component system genes during Mn(II) oxidation, supporting the idea that nutrient limitation acts as a trigger. This led us to hypothesize that introducing an external antagonistic stressor could further accelerate the onset and rate of Mn(II) oxidation. To test this, we established a synthetic microbial community in which KT2440 was confronted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, which possesses both contact-dependent and diffusible antagonistic systems. Across multiple assays measuring oxidation initiation time, manganese oxide accumulation, and bacterial survival, the presence of PAO1 significantly accelerated Mn(II) oxidation by KT2440. More importantly, Mn(II) oxidation strongly enhanced KT2440 survival under antagonistic pressure. Correlation analysis indicated a positive relationship between survival rate and oxidation intensity. Fluorescence microscopy and agent-based modeling further confirmed that this protective effect is contact-dependent. By integrating these results with earlier findings, we propose that the physiological significance of bacterial Mn(II) oxidation lies in enhancing the survival fitness of the oxidizer under stressful conditions.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

However, whether DNA-damage can induce mechanical changes that regulate downstream events such as YAP localization and that in turn feeds back onto DDR activation, remains unknown. In this study, we report that YAP translocates in a nuclear mechanics-dependent manner upon induction of Double Strand Breaks (DSBs). This translocation is not a mere epiphenomenon, and we find that: first, global nuclear eviction of YAP enhances DDR signaling; second, local enrichment of YAP at DNA damage sites promotes recruitment of DNA repair proteins previously identified as potential interactors of YAP or its partner TEAD1.

We show that KLF-1 is required for the oxidative stress resistance and longevity of germline-deficient animals. Genetic interaction studies showed that KLF-1 acts in parallel to the lipogenic regulator Sterol regulatory element-Binding Protein 1 (SBP-1/SREBP1), whereas the related KLF-2 exerts opposing effects on lipid accumulation through SBP-1.

However, the structural basis for achieving diverse specificities remains largely elusive. Here, we present the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of Tas1r1/Tas1r3 heterodimer from pufferfish, an ortholog of the human umami taste receptor. The overall structure of Tas1r1/Tas1r3LBD resembles previously reported TAS1R structures, indicating a conserved core architecture within the family. Nevertheless, pufferfish Tas1r1/Tas1r3 was found to bind and respond to both L- and D-amino acids, even though TAS1Rs are considered to respond to either enantiomer. Structural and mutational analyses revealed that this non-rigorous stereochemical recognition is attributed to inter-subdomain interactions that latch the cleft containing the amino acid-binding site. These interactions prevent the cleft from fully opening, thereby stabilizing the active conformation, even if the ligand shares a different chirality. These results suggest that different substrate specificities in TAS1Rs can be acquired not only by the gain or loss of direct interactions with the substrate but also by the gain of intramolecular interactions, which alter the conformational equilibrium of the receptor.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

In this work, we introduce a structure-based workflow for identifying SPs and their regions, aiming to optimize SPs for protein secretion in human cells. Structural modeling of the SPs in complex with human signal recognition particle 54 kDa (SRP54), combined with hydrophobicity plots of the SPs and identification of the cleavage motif, can be used to detect SPs and SP regions. Afterwards, LigandMPNN is applied to redesign the SPs based on their structural complexes with SRP54.

By comparing the redesigned SPs with the original SPs, we propose that the binding affinity of SPs to SRP54 serve as the most important molecular determinant in the activity of the SPs. Notably, our experiments confirm that the structurally optimized SPs can express the Y. pestis F1 protein, Lassa GP, and VEEV GP in human cells.

Here, we introduce synthetic niches as an alternative framework, using genetic toggle switches that couple growth to defined phenotypic states. We engineered two auxotrophic strains, TOGGLE_green and TOGGLE_yellow, in which growth is linked to either GFP- or YFP-expressing states and assessed their behavior in continuous bioreactor cultures using automated flow cytometry. Unexpectedly, the introduction of auxotrophic pressure reshaped circuit function i.e., instead of maintaining bistability, toggle strains behaved as unidirectional inducible systems that reverted upon inducer withdrawal. This feature enabled simplified control with a single input but also revealed a vulnerability to mutational escape under intensified cultivation. A simple repression-based ODE model recapitulated the reversible dynamics, but deviations under prolonged operation highlighted the rapid evolutionary erosion of control.

Here we report on the discovery of a so far non-annotated gene in the model Synechocystis sp.

Presence of SbtC was confirmed by immunoblotting after fusing the sbtC-coding sequence to a Flag-tag. Similar to sbtAB, transcription of the sbtC locus is induced by low CO2 availability but controlled independently. Mutation of the sbtC locus in a wild-type background showed only a mild phenotype even under low CO2, but the diurnal growth was impaired as found before in the mutant {triangleup}sbtB. Biochemical analysis provided evidence for a trimeric SbtABC complex in the membrane. Recombinant Synechocystis strains harboring only SbtA as single Ci uptake system with either deleted sbtB or sbtC genes showed that bicarbonate leakage from the cell was strongly elevated in both mutants. Our results provide evidence that SbtC contributes to the formation of the SbtAB complex, thereby regulating bicarbonate exchange at the cytoplasmic membrane.

Most strains grow well at 25C, but the dependence of growth rate on temperature and the width of the temperature niche vary between strains in a systematic manner. We describe steps towards designing a universal, defined, minimal media for marine bacteria, revealing that growth inhibition on amino acids and peptides by carbohydrates is widespread. Cell counts obtained from flow cytometry and colony plating differ systematically, as do different methods to assess motility. Finally, we discuss traits potentially related to microbial interactions such as hemolysis, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance. Gammaproteobacteria such as Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, and Vibrio reveal consistently robust growth, and activity, perhaps explaining why these clades are well-explored. Conclusion: Explicitly discussing the insights and challenges of working with strain libraries will pave the way to robust, reproducible, and generalizable mapping of bacterial traits across diversity.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

In this study we explored the use of Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy as an alternative method for metabolomic quality assessment of stool samples. FT-IR identifies the chemical bonds present in SCFAs and allows clear discrimination between healthy and dysbiotic stool samples (caused by Clostridioides difficile infection) through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Overall, FT-IR provides a rapid, cost-effective and simple method for stool samples quality assessment.

These low-abundance microorganisms may employ specialized trophic strategies enabling their persistence in resource-limited environments. This study examined whether established oligotrophy markers could effectively characterize and differentiate the ecophysiology of rare and uncultured bacteria recovered from diverse Russian soil metagenomes. A total of 31 soil samples (chernozems, fluvisols, solonetz, solonchak, kastanozems, and leptosols) were collected from protected natural areas in the Rostov Region, Russia. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed, and 246 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered through assembly and binning. Genomic and functional traits associated with oligotrophy - including genome size, predicted generation time, ribosomal RNA operon copy number, two-component signaling systems, chemotaxis proteins, and carbohydrate-active enzymes - were analyzed. Metabolic capabilities for C1-compound oxidation, benzoyl-CoA pathway utilization, organosulfonate metabolism, and atmospheric trace gas scavenging were annotated. Principal component analysis was employed to cluster MAGs based on ecological strategy. MAGs spanned 18 bacterial phyla, with genome sizes ranging from 0.58-11.6 Mb and predicted doubling times from 0.6-15.6 hours. Six statistically significant clusters were identified, corresponding to distinct life-history strategies: fast-growing generalists, hydrogenotrophs, C1-compound specialists, polysaccharide degraders, aromatic compound degraders, and minimal-genome specialists. Oligotrophic lifestyles were confidently inferred for Methylomirabilota, Krumholzibacteriota, and Eisenbacteria MAGs, characterized by slow growth, reliance on low-molecular-weight carbon dissipation, and reduced regulatory complexity. Copiotrophic strategies were associated with Myxococcota, Bacteroidota, Gammaproteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiota, which exhibited large genomes, rapid doubling times, extensive two-component systems, and high carbohydrate-active enzyme abundances. Combined analysis of genome size, generation time, regulatory system complexity, chemotaxis capacity, and substrate utilization pathways provides a robust framework for inferring trophic strategies of uncultured soil bacteria. Oligotrophy among rare taxa is characterized by adaptation to low-molecular-weight carbon dissipation, atmospheric trace gas oxidation, representing ecological strategies that enable persistence in nutrient-limited soil microhabitats.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined the F. tularensis ribosome and determined its structure at 2.5A resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. Notably, we observed the stress-induced ribosome-associated inhibitor A (RaiA) protein bound to the ribosome. RaiA functions as a molecular hibernation factor, inhibiting bacterial translation in response to stress or nutrient deprivation. This mechanism parallels that described in the model organism Escherichia coli and in several pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, we solved structures of the antibiotics chloramphenicol and gentamicin bound to the F. tularensis ribosome.

In this study, we employed UAV-based multispectral imaging to monitor early-stage drought stress in wheat. A panel of 221 historical spring wheat cultivars from Pakistan, representing over a century of breeding history, were evaluated under irrigated and drought conditions. UAV flights were conducted twice at early growth stages to capture multispectral imagery, which was processed in Pix4D mapper for image alignment and orthomosaic generation. Plot segmentation and trait extraction were performed in QGIS. Eight drought-responsive vegetative indices (VIs) were analyzed to assess genotypic variation. Significant to highly significant differences were observed among genotypes, treatments, and their interactions across all VIs. Broad-sense heritability estimates were moderate to high for most traits, with predominantly additive gene action. Vegetative indices such as NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, and SAVI showed strong correlations with each other and effectively detected early canopy stress under drought. Principal component analysis based on 23.897K SNPs indicated a mixed genetic population. Genome-wide association studies identified 115 significant QTNs linked to VIs under both conditions, corresponding to 74 loci, including 26 pleiotropic loci. Of these, 10 pleiotropic loci detected under drought were annotated and six putative candidate genes were identified which showed expression in multiple tissues based on transcriptome data. Two genes i.e., TraesCS1D01G217600.1 (HSP70) and TraesCS6D01G254000.1 (ZmMDAR3), showed differential expression pattern among control and drought treatment. These findings highlight the potential of UAV-based phenotyping for early drought detection and provide candidate genes for improving drought tolerance in wheat.

Here, we demonstrate that the long leader region encodes a transcriptional attenuator that we named cATTpLS20. In vivo and in vitro analyses showed that the attenuator is composed of three segments: a stem-loop structure with a long imperfect stem that is preceded by a sequence that may form a weak stem-loop and followed by a sequence that may form an intrinsic terminator. Sequences of the upstream stem loop and downstream terminator are complementary, allowing further extension of the long stem, thereby generating an antiterminator conformation. Based on similarity with a zipper we coined this the zipper-type attenuator. Similar zipper-type attenuators are present upstream of the first genes of conjugation operons of all pLS20 family plasmids, as well as on many other conjugative plasmids in Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting that a common attenuation mechanism regulates expression of many conjugative operons.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

A common approach is to study the impact of m6A depending on its particular location in the transcripts, but the global impact of m6A along mRNAs remains unclear. Here, we combined ribosome profiling under conditions of mTOR inhibition and m6A mapping to identify distinct subsets of mRNAs that differ in their sensitivity to the suppression of cap-dependent initiation. The sensitivity was strongly correlated with the total m6A methylation of the transcripts. Further, we demonstrated that upon decreased mTOR activity, m6A methylation facilitated the enhanced association of mRNAs with components of the eIF4F complex. Thus, the efficiency of cap-independent translation initiation is primarily defined not by precise localization but by the total level of m6A methylation, and m6A has a compensatory role in maintaining translation when the canonical cap-dependent pathway is impaired. All in all, our findings underscore the significance of contemplating global m6A methylation status as a pivotal element in translational control, particularly under stress or signaling perturbations.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

The genome organizer SATB1 is essential for T cell development and its loss triggers a severe autoimmune phenotype. Here, we identify a pathogenic transcriptional axis, involving BACH1 and cMAF, that is unleashed upon SATB1 deletion. Using integrated multi-omics in T cell-specific Satb1-knockout mice, we demonstrate that SATB1 constrains BACH1 chromatin occupancy. In its absence, BACH1 redistributes to promoter-proximal regions and SATB1-bound immune loci, where it facilitates the recruitment of the transcription factor cMAF. This BACH1-cMAF complex drives a pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in thymocytes, which seeds the periphery and results in a systemic autoimmune disease. Strikingly, genetic ablation of Bach1 in Satb1-deficient mice rescues the pathology, normalizes immunity and prevents mortality. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of cMAF ameliorates the disease. The pro-inflammatory signature in mutant T cells overlaps with T cells from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients.

This study reports the isolation, identification, and virulence evaluation of six indigenous EPN isolates collected from different agroecological zones in Nigeria. Morphological and morphometric assessments, supported by molecular analyses of internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS), D2D3, and mitochondrial gene regions, identified the isolates as Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Steinernema carpocapsae, S. feltiae, S. nepalense, and Oscheius myriophilus. Virulence bioassays were conducted against four developmental stages of S. frugiperda (2nd, 4th, 6th instar larvae and pupae) using four dosages (25, 50, 100, and 200 infective juveniles [IJs]/insect). All isolates exhibited dose- and time-dependent pathogenicity, with FAW 2nd instar larvae showing the highest susceptibility. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Ib-CRIN68) caused the highest mortality (82.4 {+/-} 5.6%) and the lowest lethal concentration (LC50) and lethal time (LT50) values among the tested EPN isolates. Significant effects of isolate, dosage, and exposure time on larval mortality (p < 0.001) were found, particularly in early instars. The findings highlight the high biocontrol potential of these Nigerian EPN isolates and underscore the value of integrating molecular and morphological diagnostics for accurate species identification.

This often allows the acceptable species differentiation and phylogenetic positioning by just using the partial sequence of the cytochrome c oxidase (COI) gene. However, for biological, statistical, or technical reasons, several exceptions to that fact have been observed, which together with a lack of a solid criterion to differentiate species at the molecular level, make difficult the interpretation of some taxonomic and systematic outcomes. With the scope of providing a standardized system improving the molecular Scolopendra species delimitation and surpassing some issues related with the mtDNAs use, a total of 45 representative COI sequences belonging to 22 taxa are tested, but for the first time, performing distinct amino acids chains evolution analyses. To illustrate this, a general evaluation of the genus is firstly provided, while to exemplify some of the deeper analysis, the cases of S. paradoxa Domenech, 2018 and S. spinosissima Kraepelin, 1903 are then here re explored using some alternative tools. As a result, the partial COI protein sequences analysis identified, at least, ten amino acid residues positions as useful for Scolopendra species differentiation, being generally 38 five divergent residues enough to distinguish taxa [the five divergent amino acid rule]. When this premise wasnt fulfilled, the amino acid frequency, exclusivity, or electrochemical properties and especially the r substitution probability test, helped solve the cases. Among S. paradoxa and S. spinosissima five diverging residues were found, with one of them being exclusive to the entire genus for the former taxon. Also, the substitution probability (r) analysis showed strong positive selection for three of these five divergent amino acids.

We analysed four barley genotypes under simultaneous Fusarium culmorum infection and drought stress by phenotyping of Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) disease, hormone profiling, and transcriptome analysis. FHB severity was host genotype-dependent, with moderately resistant cultivars Avalon and Barke showing increased FHB under drought, while drought did not further increase FHB severity in highly susceptible Morex and Palmella Blue. Transcriptome analysis revealed largely additive effects of single stresses, with drought-dominated regulation with increasing drought severity at later stages. Co-expression analysis connected abscisic acid and auxin to gene expression modules functionally enriched with stress-specific physiological responses. Stress-response genes, uniformly expressed across genotypes, were linked to pathogen defence, detoxification, and drought adaptation, whereas a cluster of hundreds of moderately Fusarium-responsive genes was limited in up-regulation under combined stress, possibly explaining enhanced FHB severity under drought. A multiple linear regression model accurately predicted combined stress expression from single stress responses, demonstrating modularity of barley`s stress regulation under combined drought and Fusarium stress.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

We developed an incremental modeling framework that progressively incorporates factors contributing to aging into a model of population survival dynamics, which we used to estimate lifespan limits if all aging hallmarks were eliminated except somatic mutations. Our analysis reveals fundamental asymmetry across organs: post-mitotic cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes act as critical longevity bottlenecks, with somatic mutations reducing median lifespan from a theoretical non-aging baseline of 430 years to 169 years. In contrast, proliferating tissues like liver maintain functionality for thousands of years through cellular replacement, effectively neutralizing mutation-driven decline. Multi-organ integration predicts median lifespans of 134-170 years--approximately twice current human longevity.

The genomic basis underlying this transition, particularly among Indian clinical isolates, remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the genomic attributes of a prevalent P. mirabilis strain from India. Methods Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the clinical isolate was performed using next-generation sequencing. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and virulence factors were identified through ResFinder, CARD, and VFDB. Sequence typing was performed using MLST. Protein-protein interaction networks and noncoding RNA elements were analyzed using STRING, CytoHubba, and BAKTA. Results WGS confirmed the multidrug-resistant profile of the isolate and revealed a broad array of AMR genes, including blaTEM-1B, conferring resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Several resistance determinants were co-localized with insertion sequences on the same contig, indicating a high potential for horizontal gene transfer. The virulome contained multiple fimbrial genes, hemolysins, and toxin-encoding loci, supporting strong adhesion, biofilm formation, and host tissue damage. Comparative genomic analysis identified unique features not present in reference isolates, including additional virulence determinants and mobile genetic elements. MLST revealed that the isolate is closely related to ST-675 and ST-797, while virulence typing (vST 1157) indicated a novel profile distinct from ST-675 reference strains. In silico protein-protein interaction analysis showed a highly interconnected virulence network, with urease, fimbrial adhesins, and hemolysins forming central functional modules. A noncoding RNA was identified within the genomic region of the ure operon (Contig 10), suggesting a potential regulatory role in urease expression. Conclusions This study provides the first genomic characterization of a multidrug-resistant P. mirabilis clinical isolate from India, designated P. mirabilis strain Indica. The convergence of AMR genes, virulence factors, mobile genetic elements, and a novel noncoding RNA linked to urease expression underscores the emergence of a high-risk variant. These findings highlight the need for continued genomic surveillance to guide therapeutic strategies and strengthen infection control efforts.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

A major obstacle to curing HIV is the persistence of silent viral genomes in host cells that evade immune detection and resist therapy. Here, we present a fluorescence microscopy-based method for direct in vivo visualization of full-length double-stranded HIV-1 DNA, an achievement not previously realized. To achieve this, we developed an advanced imaging platform adapted for replication-competent HIV-1. This system leverages a bacterial-derived two-component tagging strategy, where a fluorescent protein (OR-GFP), efficiently expressed in xenografted human immune cells, specifically binds to an engineered ANCH3 tag sequence integrated into the viral genome. The tagged virus infects CD4+ T cells both in vitro and in vivo, producing bright nuclear puncta corresponding to individual viral genomes. Multiple nucleation sites within ANCH3 enable a stable, shortened tag form for persistent and long-term tracking. Transcriptional profiling during acute infection revealed both transcriptionally active and silent genomes in spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, with silent forms enriched in lymph nodes and marrow, supporting early reservoir establishment. This live-cell imaging strategy enables high-specificity detection of latent HIV, offering a transformative tool for studying reservoir dynamics and guiding future cure strategies.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Here we determine that accumulation of damaging reducing equivalents is an unanticipated toxicity associated with biguanides, the defense against which requires post-transcriptional protection of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. We demonstrate that biguanide treatment during impaired fatty acid biosynthesis drives NADPH toxicity, leading to catastrophic elevation of NADH/GSH reducing equivalents and accelerated death across metazoans. Multiple NADPH-generating interventions require fatty acid biosynthesis to prevent markedly shortened survival, indicating that this defense mechanism is broadly leveraged. We propose that fatty acid biosynthesis is a tunable rheostat which can minimize biguanide-induced reductive stress whilst maximizing its pro-longevity outcomes and serve as an exploitable vulnerability in reductive stress sensitive cancers.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Single-particle cryo-EM traditionally relies on purified macromolecules and lacks the complexity of cellular environments, whereas in situ cryo-EM or cryo-ET require extensive sample preparation and data acquisition, presenting challenges in achieving high resolution. We describe cryo-EM of cellular lysates, in extracto cryo-EM, allowing the flexibility and high-resolution of cryo-EM in the context of cellular components. High-resolution 2D template matching (2DTM) yields ~2.2 A maps of the mammalian translational apparatus.

Experimental results confirmed that elevating GC3 increases both protein output and mRNA abundance, in both GC- and AT-rich species. Comparative analyses across 80 plant species, spanning a wide range of GC3 levels, show that GC3 content is positively correlated with translation efficiency. Additionally, high GC3-codon usage is conserved among endogenous high-abundance proteins, such as Rubisco small subunits and ribosomal proteins.

LncRNA-ZMIZ1-AS1 has attracted considerable attention for its role in the tumor microenvironment, particularly in the regulation of HCC cell growth, invasion, and biological behavior. However, the specific mechanisms of LncRNA-ZMIZ1-AS1 in HCC remain unclear. Methods: We analyzed the relationship between LncRNA-ZMIZ1-AS1 and HCC clinical prognosis using bioinformatics with GEO and TCGA datasets. We also conducted molecular biology experiments, including cell culture, real-time PCR, and Western blotting, as well as cell viability and flow cytometry analyses, to investigate the effects of LncRNA-ZMIZ1-AS1 knockdown on HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Furthermore, we used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify potential signaling pathways involving LncRNA-ZMIZ1-AS1. Results: LncRNA-ZMIZ1-AS1 was highly expressed in HCC patients and significantly associated with clinical characteristics, such as gender and clinical stage. Knockdown of LncRNA-ZMIZ1-AS1 notably inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while increasing apoptosis rates. Additionally, GSEA suggested a potential association between high LncRNA-ZMIZ1-AS1 expression and the NOTCH signaling pathway.

In addition, adh-1 is transcriptionally activated in yeast, worms, mice, and humans in response to caloric restriction-an intervention that extends not only lifespan but also healthspan. Therefore, we investigated whether activating adh-1 could also extend healthspan. We demonstrate here that adh-1 activation has broad and robust effects on health, including resistance to age-related obesity, delayed sarcopenia, and attenuated neurodegeneration.

The deposit contained nine complete, articulated sheep skeletons, mostly older individuals of both sexes, which were unbutchered but displayed flaying marks. Aside from minor age-related lesions and one ectopic bone nodule, the animals exhibited good skeletal health, with no obvious cause of death. Ancient DNA analysis was therefore conducted and proved highly successful, conclusively identifying two ovine pathogens: sheeppox virus (SPPV) and the parasite Taenia hydatigena. When considered alongside archaeological, veterinary and historical evidence, these findings indicate that the animals died during a sheeppox outbreak. This study provides the first detection of SPPV in archaeological bone and the first paleogenome of this virus.

M.; Parker, J. B.; Kohli, R. M.", "abstract": "The epigenome provides a dynamic layer of gene regulatory control above the static genetic sequence. Epigenetic DNA base modifications are a key regulator of gene expression, which in mammalian genomes predominantly occur in CpG contexts and are disproportionately distributed in regulatory regions like promoters. Chromatin-associated proteins and transcription factors work in tandem with these modifications to further control gene regulation. Given the interplay of these factors, mapping DNA base modifications concurrently with protein-DNA occupancy is therefore critical to interpreting the epigenome. Current multi-modal mapping methods employ DNA methyltransferases that mark accessible protein-unbound DNA in non-CpG contexts. However, the overlap of this exogenous DNA methylation with naturally occurring modifications can confound readouts and significantly limit compatibility with methods to simultaneously read epigenetic states. To circumvent these limitations, we explored the possibility of introducing an unnatural DNA base modification as an alternative label for protein occupancy. Here, we report our efforts to rationally engineer non-CpG-specific DNA carboxymethyltransferases, characterize their neomorphic activity, and assess DNA carboxymethylation as a reporter of protein occupancy on DNA. We find that DNA carboxymethylation of cytosines in GpC contexts shows broad compatibility with the most widely used epigenetic detection methods and reliably reports on protein occupancy state.

Using chick in ovo electroporation, Notch reporter assays, and conditional mouse mutants, we find that canonical Notch signalling is active during neurogenesis but not within the Sox2-positive PSD. Jag1 loss leads to a gradual loss of Sox2, yet RBPJk; mutants retain Sox2, indicating a non-canonical Notch pathway. We further reveal that the non-sensory determinant Lmx1a is regulated by Wnt/beta-catenin signalling and that manipulating Wnt activity shifts the balance between Lmx1a and Sox2 expression. Finally, we show that NICD can directly interact with beta-catenin in the cytoplasm, suggesting that NICD sequesters beta-catenin to suppress Wnt activity and stabilise Sox2 in the PSD.

Here, using quantitative 3D live imaging, mechanical and biochemical manipulations, we dissect the mechanisms governing centrosomal complex (CC) migration and spindle orientation in ascidian 2-cell stage embryos to generate the characteristic planar, square 4-cell stage. We show that following the first mitotic division, CCs in the two blastomeres form at variable orientations relative to the mother spindle and progressively achieve parallel and coplanar alignment during interphase of the 2-cell stage. Final spindle orientation is established prior to nuclear envelope breakdown, contrasting with dynamic spindle reorientation reported in other systems. Our analyses reveal that CC rotation is driven by forces acting on long astral microtubules and guided by an anisotropic, ER-rich cytoplasmic domain that surrounds the CCs. This ER domain correlates with a dense astral microtubule network, enabling length-dependent microtubule pulling that orients the CCs independently of cell shape. In parallel, dynein-mediated cortical pulling refines spindle tilt and maintains coplanarity.

Here, we assessed the reported risk posed by collisions to 108 European birds, comparatively across species. We drew risk maps to assess current hotspots of risk. We employed a customised risk approach, considering that risk emerged from the interaction between (1) reported impacts (the total estimated number of fatalities at the species-level, accounting for current exposure to wind turbines) and (2) vulnerability to these impacts (the degree to which species may be affected by collision mortality). We used a quantitative synthesis of fatality numbers at wind-energy facilities to quantify collision-mortality rates at the species-level. We derived (1) by further combining these with information on species suitable areas and on current wind-turbine deployment. We estimated species' vulnerability from ecological characteristics (generation length, clutch size, and estimates of European suitable area) assumed to reflect species' ability to cope with disturbances. Overlapping vulnerability with estimated impacts, we classified species into different risk categories, considering species to be at higher relative risk when more vulnerable and more impacted. We assessed where species falling into the risk categories might occur, and where possible conflicts with wind-energy deployment might arise. We found several risk hotspots notably located in the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Europe.

Once considered a neutral marker, mitochondrial DNA variation is now recognized as critical to phenotypic evolution because of its epistatic interactions and history of coevolution with the nuclear genome. A central challenge in evolutionary genetics is to quantify the relative importance of stabilizing and directional selection shaping complex trait distributions within and among species. Both can act on interacting and/or co-evolving genes contributing to quantitative traits, but resolving their relative roles is complicated by the complex architecture of most traits. Here, we use a panel of 90 Drosophila mitonuclear genotypes to quantify the relative contributions of mitochondrial, nuclear, and environmental variation and their interactions to four metabolically demanding complex traits. We sample both within-species and between-species mitochondrial variation and observe stronger interaction effects attributable to within-species variation, consistent with stabilizing selection maintaining mitonuclear function. Additionally, culturing the flies on a mitochondrial Complex I inhibitor, rotenone, reveals significant genotype x environment (GxE and GxGxE) interaction effects, providing insight into how genetic variation can be maintained across changing environments.

The set of mitochondrially encoded tRNAs and ribosomal subunits is highly variable across angiosperms, with many examples of mitochondrial gene loss, replacement, and/or transfer to the nucleus. This dynamic history suggests large-scale remodeling of mitochondrial translation machinery in some lineages, but such conclusions are largely inferred from genomic sequence and protein targeting predictions. Here, we use proteomic (LC-MS/MS) analysis of purified mitochondria and chloroplasts from angiosperm species with major differences in mitochondrial gene content (Arabidopsis thaliana and Silene conica). Our analysis largely confirms the current understanding of subcellular localization for nuclear-encoded proteins involved in tRNA metabolism and ribosome function in A. thaliana, although some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) may have more specialized subcellular roles than previously thought. In contrast, S. conica has undergone extensive mitochondrial gene loss and numerous associated changes in the composition of its mitochondrial proteome, including retargeting of aaRSs, replacement of ribosomal subunits, and loss of the glutamine amidotransferase (GatCAB) complex. Overall, this analysis illustrates how the complex network of molecular interactions necessary for mitochondrial translation are perturbed by gene loss, transfer, and replacement.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Often, trees and shrubs promote herb growth in dry sites but suppress it in wetter ones, as predicted by the classical Stress Gradient Hypothesis. However, explanations for the facilitation-to-competition transition remain verbal and contested, lacking a clear link to resource competition theory. Here, we present a mechanistic framework consisting of two submodels: (i) canopy shading that reduces photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and (ii) root effects, including water uptake and increased moisture via hydraulic redistribution. We elucidate the conditions under which interactions shift from facilitation to competition. The models reproduce this reversal only when water is not the sole limiting factor at high rainfall or when woody density increases with precipitation. Moreover, the reversal can occur across any aridity gradient, including those driven by evaporative demand influenced by temperature and humidity. The two pathways leave distinct signatures: canopy shading produces a hump-shaped pattern with maximum facilitation at intermediate stress, while the root pathway predicts a shift from positive to negative interactions as water availability increases. By translating a classic idea into a quantitative framework, this model enhances ecosystem management in a changing world.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

We studied the relationship between >150 years of landscape change and brood XIII periodical cicada activity in Johnson County, IA. We found that the presence of Magicicada breeding populations was better predicted by tree cover in 1930 than by present-day tree cover, with cicadas primarily relegated to sites that did not fall below 17.4% tree cover. While total forest has increased since 1930, this is a net increase, inclusive of considerable turnover every 17 years, and cicada ranges have declined more than they have expanded. A model based on empirical measures of forest turnover and cicada dispersal distances suggests that cicada ranges will continue to decline under nearly all conditions. A managed relocation of 20,126 adult Magicicada to a restored forest failed, reinforcing that dispersal to new sites cannot be artificially accelerated to offset declines.

We analyzed 196 stick and leaf insect species (Phasmatodea), a clade with exceptional diversity in size, shape, flight capacity, and mating systems, using phylogenetic comparative methods to evaluate the roles of fecundity selection, sexual selection, and ecological factors. SSD was universally female-biased and varied over an order of magnitude. Allometric scaling supported the inverse of Rensch's rule, and clade-level patterns matched predictions from quantitative genetic models in which stronger directional selection on females than on males explains female-biased SSD. However, interspecific variation in SSD was not explained by female fecundity. Instead, mating system and flight dimorphism best predicted variation in SSD and SShD: males engaging in short-term mate guarding (less than a few days) were larger and stockier than searching males or those exhibiting prolonged mate guarding, reducing SSD, whereas species with flight-capable males and flightless females showed increased dimorphism, largely due to smaller males. Habitat and climate had limited effects. Sex differences in growth rate and development duration contributed equally to SSD, with females growing faster and for longer, consistent with widespread protandry. These results indicate that while fecundity selection historically drove female-biased SSD, contemporary variation is primarily shaped by male-specific selection through mating system and flight-related ecological pressures.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

By integrating all publicly available spider genomes, we examined the genomic evolutionary dynamics of 67 species including at least 5 independent origins of diurnality. Across diurnal spider lineages, hundreds of genes exhibited convergent shifts in selection, including intensified selection on neural, locomotion, and visual system genes, and relaxed selection on several core phototransduction components. Notably, diurnal spiders showed convergent deceleration in evolutionary rates in circadian regulators, such as CLOCK and CRTC1, and they harbored distinct repertoires of positively selected genes relative to non-diurnal species. In addition, convergent amino acid substitutions were enriched in diurnal hunting spiders. Comparative multi-tissue transcriptomics showed that genes under convergent selection, particularly those involved in vision, sensory processing, nervous system development, and locomotion, tended to exhibit stronger eye- and brain-biased tissue specificity in diurnal species. Altogether, our results reveal convergent genomic changes associated with repeated evolution of diurnality and illustrate how ecological light environments repeatedly shape the molecular evolution of complex animal behavior.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Yet the mechanism driving polyploid abundance is unclear. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed including polyploid abundance is proportional to the opportunity for whole genome duplication (WGD), and WGD alters phenotypes that may increase fitness. We tested these two hypotheses together in the mixed-ploidy species Andropogon gerardi, a dominant grass species in endangered North American tallgrass prairies. Leveraging a novel, phased allopolyploid reference genome, we found the A. gerardi hexaploid arose after the C4 grassland expansion in the early Pleistocene, when glacial cycles likely increased secondary contact between the diploid progenitors. We sequenced A. gerardi from 25 populations and examined cytotype performance and morphology in a controlled environment to investigate the consequences of the contemporary mixed-ploidy populations. We found the 9x A. gerardi cytotype is a neopolyploid and a result of recurrent WGD events. Further, we demonstrate the 9x neopolyploids have greater growth and a decreased stomatal pore index, which is adaptive in xeric climates where the 9x cytotype is most common. Together, our results support both hypotheses for polyploid abundance in North America: WGD is a product of opportunity and can have immediate fitness consequences. Although the changes to fitness may provide an advantage to 9x A. gerardi, the establishment of 9x may lower overall population fitness due to the lower reproductive viability of \\nine individuals.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

The pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), a major forest pest expanding northward and upward in Europe, provides an ideal model to explore genomic adaptation along altitudinal and/or latitudinal gradients. We combined pooled and individual whole-genome resequencing of four pairs of low- and high-elevation populations from Spain, Italy and France (mainland and Corsica) to detect signatures of local adaptation. Population structure analyses revealed strong differentiation among distant populations but limited divergence within altitude pairs. Genome scans identified a few candidate regions under selection, and we notably uncovered a large (ca. 1 Mbp) region showing reduced nucleotide diversity, negative Tajima's D, and fixed allele differences between high- and low-altitude populations, consistent with a recent selective sweep. This region includes a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes and the voltage-gated sodium channel gene para, both involved in detoxification and insecticide resistance. Although signatures of selection were observed at this locus in two distant population pairs, no definitive evidence of recent introgression was found between these distant populations, suggesting independent evolution.

However, the mechanisms by which these genetic risk factors perturb dopamine circuits and cause psychotic symptoms remain poorly understood. We asked how behavior, dorsomedial striatal dopamine (DA) dynamics and the activity of D1-/D2-spiny projection neurons (SPNs) were altered in Grin2a and Akap11 mutants. In the open field, Grin2a knockout mice display hyperlocomotion and an abnormal organization of naturalistic behaviors. They also displayed heightened behavioral responses to objects and auditory stimuli. Grin2a heterozygous animals mostly showed intermediate phenotypes, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of Grin2a loss. Further, Grin2a knockout mutants exhibited aberrant dopamine events, altered coupling of dopamine with locomotor features, and exaggerated stimuli-evoked dopamine responses. Notably, heterozygous animals also showed altered striatal SPN events in the open field reflecting dysregulated neural activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs. Compared to Grin2a mutants, Akap11 mutants displayed opposite phenotypes, showing reduced locomotion with a shift from high- to low-velocity movement and distinct alterations in striatal neural activity. Together, GRIN2A (SCZ risk) and AKAP11 (BD/SCZ risk) mutations induce different, often opposite, effects on striatal dopamine signaling and behavior, suggesting that these two risk genes act through distinct mechanisms.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

We found that prior training accelerated behavioral adaptation to a novel environment and that this was accompanied by highly stable hippocampal representations. We identified putative memory traces from prior experience that enabled this generalization at multiple levels. At the population level, novel-context network dynamics rapidly aligned with low-dimensional neural subspaces established during prior experience. At the cellular level, spatially-informative weak ''residual'' activity reflecting generalizable information about the task structure appeared to bias which neurons form place fields (PFs) and where via behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). Finally, this was an active process as many PFs changed their reference frame in the novel environment to reflect the consistent task structure.

D.", "abstract": "Computational models can be used to generate hypotheses about the brain. In the visual system, this approach has revealed similarities between how natural images are represented in convolutional neural networks and in cortical regions. However, natural images generate highly correlated representations across the hierarchy of model layers, meaning that each brain region will not correspond selectively to a single layer. Because each model layer performs additional image transformations, gaining a more selective mapping between individual layers and regions could reveal how specific algorithmic stages of processing are instantiated in the brain. To enable this mapping, we developed a generative framework for image synthesis that minimizes the similarity of image representational similarity matrices across model layers, aiming to orthogonalize the distances between the patterns of unit activations evoked by the same set of images. With the patterns orthogonalized, the resulting similarity matrix for each layer provides a fingerprint of the unique computational role of that layer. To test this approach, we synthesized 16 artificial images from the Inception-V1/GoogLeNet model and scanned participants with fMRI while they viewed these images repeatedly in random order. Image-specific patterns of voxel activity were used to compute image-by-image similarity matrices across the whole brain with searchlights. Most layers could be mapped to circumscribed cortical regions, and these mappings overlapped less than the mappings obtained with natural images. Given the prevalence of existing fMRI datasets with natural images, we used the synthesis method as a benchmark to develop an alternative residual method that can achieve comparable performance for natural image datasets. These approaches could be extended to other neural network architectures and stimulus modalities for targeted mappings of model computations to the brain and behavior.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Full disruption of lactate shuttling in peripheral nerves causes progressive axon degeneration, but we were interested to understand how partial disruption, a scenario more relevant to aging and disease, contributes to neurodegeneration risk. Pyruvate and lactate are interconverted by lactate dehydrogenases (LDHA and LDHB) in both lactate producing and consuming cells. We therefore began by investigating Ldhb knockout mice (loss of LDHA, the dominant LDH in liver and muscle, caused embryonic lethality), and discovered that they develop progressive neuromuscular junction atrophy and functional decline without axon degeneration. Because even Ldhb+/- heterozygosity significantly affects motor behavior, we also wondered about a potential link to congenital disease and pursued this by identifying rare loss-of-function LDHB variants among ALS patients. Next, to better understand how LDHB loss leads to motor decline, we selectively deleted it in defined cell types. SC-specific deletion caused robust motor defects, whereas motor neuron-specific deletion has little effect. Reasoning that neuronal LDHB deficiency could model age-associated decline in lactate metabolism, we asked whether it would interact with ALS genetic risk. Indeed, motor-neuron LDHB deficiency synergizes with relatively mild ALS risk variants, TDP43-Q331K and Sod1-D83G knock-in alleles, to produce early motor neuropathy, indicating that LDHB loss enhances disease risk.

ARGs can be inferred using multiple different methods, but these methods all rely on computational haplotype phasing. Previous studies have shown that the accuracy of haplotype phasing can be low when done in small or medium-sized samples, which are typical for most non-model organisms. Conventional wisdom would, therefore, suggest that ARG inferences are of limited utility in most non-model organisms. To test this assumption, we benchmark the robustness of four ARG inference methods, Relate, SINGER, Threads, and tsinfer+tsdate, to phasing errors. Their performance with imperfect phasing was tested under simple and realistic demographic models, and evaluated in terms of estimated pairwise coalescence times, counts of inferred recombination breakpoints, and estimated branch-length-based diversity. We observe only a slight degradation in performance when using computational phasing across all four methods and all tested demographic scenarios, demonstrating a surprising robustness of ARG inference methods to phasing inaccuracies.

To overcome this limitation, we develop CRISPore-seq, which couples massively-parallel CRISPR perturbations with joint short- and long-read transcriptomics. CRISPore-seq simultaneously captures genetic perturbations and expression of genes, full-length transcripts and surface proteins in single cells. CRISPore-seq long reads identify 80% more transcript isoforms than short reads. Nearly all long reads map to unique transcript isoforms, in contrast to existing single-cell perturbation methods, which rarely distinguish specific isoforms. Using CRISPore-seq, we knock-down 15 different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and identify thousands of perturbation-driven alternative splicing events (ASEs). We find that exon skipping is the most common ASE observed and that skipped exons are enriched for binding sites of perturbed RBPs. Loss of the Nager syndrome-associated spliceosomal factor SF3B4 triggers skipping of exon 2 in the cell-cycle regulator CCND1, preventing formation of a complex with CDK6 and blocking the G1-S transition.

Moreover, Melody demonstrates strong generalization in meQTLs variant effect prediction, and Melody reveals key sequence motifs associated with methylation variability. Finally, to extend prediction to unseen cell types, we develop a sequence based model augmented with scRNA seq derived embeddings, enabling accurate inference of cell type specific methylation states directly from transcriptomic data. Together, Melody provides a powerful framework for decoding the genomic and transcriptional logic that governs DNA methylation specificity in the human epigenome.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

However, the contribution of domain-general cognition (g) to the performance of virtually all complex behavioral tasks may encumber such efforts. This possibility has been largely unexplored. Here, we examined the influence of g in lesion-deficit mapping using a combination of structural equation modeling, lesion-behavior mapping (LBM), and structural (sLNM) and functional (fLNM) lesion network mapping. We modeled latent variables for visuospatial ability, processing speed, language, and anterograde memory among 473 patients with focal brain damage (age range 20-93, 257 men, 216 women), both with and without g-associated variance embedded within each factor. Lesion-deficit maps for domain-specific cognitive abilities were statistically significantly less spatially inter-correlated after partitioning out g (p = 0.010 for LBM; p = 0.003 for sLNM; p = 0.003 for fLNM). Lesion-deficit maps also implicated the existence of distinct neuroanatomy for specific cognitive domains that was, in many cases, only apparent and clearly distinct from lesion-deficit maps of g after partitioning out the influence of g. Overall, our findings suggest that, if left unaccounted for, domain-general cognitive variance could tangibly affect conclusions about the extent to which different cognitive functions rely on distinct neuroanatomy.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent reading difficulties despite adequate intelligence and educational opportunities. The cognitive underpinnings of dyslexia remain incompletely understood. Although multiple causal pathways have been proposed, there is a gap in studies that can reliably identify dyslexia subtypes based on comprehensive evaluations that go beyond measures of reading and phonology. We employed one of the largest detailed samples of children with developmental dyslexia resistant to intervention, consisting of 147 extensively phenotyped school-age children aged 7-14 years who were recruited from specialized schools for students with learning differences. We implemented data-driven analyses leveraging a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to delineate cognitive subdomains and characterize the heterogeneity in the sample. Hierarchical clustering of 24 cognitive measures aided in constructing a framework to subsequently interpret emerging clusters. Four clusters emerged, predominantly associated with: Processing Speed & Executive Function, Visuospatial & Mathematical Reasoning, Phonological Manipulation, and Verbal Short-term Memory & Word Retrieval. Subsequent latent profile analysis identified two distinct dyslexia profiles: one characterized by marked difficulties in executive functioning and processing speed, and another displaying impairments primarily in verbal short-term memory and word retrieval relative to the other profile. Importantly, both profiles exhibited comparable severity of persistent reading difficulties despite their divergent cognitive profiles. These findings show that phenotypically similar reading impairments can arise from distinct underlying cognitive factors, emphasizing the role of comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation in developing tailored interventions for affected children.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Neurexins severely modulate anxiety, social behaviours and aggression.", "doi": "10.1101/2025.11.24.690344", "authors": "Nguyen, Q.; Guo, F.; Mowry, B.; Das, J.; Giacomotto, J.", "abstract": "Can we reproduce mental disorders in zebrafish? To explore this question, we manipulated the neurexin gene family. Neurexin (nrxn) genes encode synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that have been repetitively associated with neurodevelopmental and mental disorders. While the zebrafish animal model offers tremendous advantages for dissecting neural development/function, no robust nrxn zebrafish models are currently available. In this study, we generated the first collection of zebrafish knockout lines for each nrxn gene, with mutations ranging from transmembrane domain- to full genomic locus-deletions. Surprisingly, all homozygous lines developed normally, presenting no gross neurodevelopmental or obvious early behavioural abnormalities. However, this absence of early phenotypes translated into profound, paralog-specific behavioural alterations emerging during juvenile-to-adult stages. All neurexin knockouts affected mating behaviour, complicating the generation and maintenance of homozygous lines. Except for this shared behavioural alteration, nrxn1, but not nrxn2 or nrxn3, led to marked changes in social behaviour and aggression. In contrast, nrxn2 mutants exhibited severe anxiety-like behaviours, including bottom-dwelling and repetitive freezing/seizure events. Strikingly, nrxn1 full-locus deletion mutants showed opposing behaviour, spending most of their time near the surface. The two also displayed opposite responses to open/closed field transitions; confinement alleviated nrxn2 anxiety but enhanced nrxn1 surface-dwelling. Meanwhile, nrxn3 mutants behaved normally in all our initial tests. In summary, our study introduces a complete set of zebrafish mutants covering the whole nrxn gene family, presenting striking juvenile/adult behavioural alterations despite the absence of noticeable early defects; echoing the delayed onset of human psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. This work demonstrates the value of zebrafish to study mental disorders and unlock a novel platform to unravel the pathogenic contribution of neurexin and associated subtle neurodevelopmental changes/timing that drive the emergence of mental illnesses.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

S.; Zenke, F.", "abstract": "Tracking prey or recognizing a lurking predator is as crucial for survival as anticipating their actions. To guide behavior, the brain must extract information about object identities and their dynamics from entangled sensory inputs. How it accomplishes this feat remains an open question. Predictive coding theories propose that this ability arises by comparing predicted sensory signals with actual inputs and reducing the associated prediction errors. However, existing models rely on generative architectures that compute prediction errors directly in the input space, which is hard to reconcile with neural anatomy. Here, we develop a theory that avoids this issue by operating solely on internal representations. Specifically, we introduce recurrent predictive learning (RPL), a recurrent joint-embedding predictive architecture inspired by self-supervised machine learning, that learns abstract representations of object identity and their dynamics and predicts future object motion. Crucially, the model learns sequence representations that resemble successor-like representations observed in the primary visual cortex of humans. The model also develops abstract sequence representations comparable to those reported in the macaque prefrontal cortex. Finally, we outline how RPL's modular feedforward-recurrent organization could map onto canonical cortical microcircuits as a plausible model of cortical representation learning. Our work establishes a circuit-centric theory framework that unifies predictive processing with self-supervised learning, providing a fresh perspective on how the brain acquires an internal model of the world.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

M.; Lobbia, S.; Aguirre, J. D.; Takei, Y.; Chen, C.-H.; Sternberg, P. W.; Lois, C.; Elowitz, M. B.; Cai, L.", "abstract": "Obtaining wiring diagrams of brains has been a major achievement for neuroscience. However, an underlying challenge in connectomics is the fundamental tradeoff between the imaging resolution needed to resolve synapses and the volume of the brain that can be imaged. For example, electron microscopy (EM) visualizes synaptic sites with ~5 nm resolution, but is difficult to scale beyond volumes of 1 mm3. Here, we present Synaptic MEMOIR (Memory with Engineered Mutagenesis with Optical in situ Readout) that enables imaging of neuronal projections in animal brains with single-synapse resolution. Synaptic MEMOIR is built around three key design features. First, protein barcodes are transported to synapses to allow matching of synaptic barcodes to cell body barcodes without high resolution imaging and the error-prone process of tracing neuronal processes across long distances. Second, Synaptic MEMOIR uses continuous mutagenesis to generate a large diversity of barcodes to uniquely label cell bodies and synapses. Last, the timing of recombination and transport can be tuned to record synaptic age or projection information. Combining these features, we demonstrated projection mapping of 113 neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster optic lobe in a volume of 9.5 million m3. Because synapses are identified by transported barcodes with optical microscopy at 300 nm resolution, this approach can potentially scale to much larger volumes, similar at least to those imaged in recent mouse brain transcriptomics atlases. In addition, synaptic MEMOIR can match barcodes across brain sections, and does not require tissue clearing to track long-range projections. Together, these results provide the foundation for a scalable optical image-based system for reconstructing the neural wiring diagrams of brains across different developmental stages, genetic backgrounds and perturbations.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

J.; Turnbull, A. G.; Smallwood, J.; Lin, F. V.", "abstract": "Understanding the neural activity underlying spontaneous thought - when attention shifts from external tasks to internally generated content - is a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. However, research on such internal states has lagged external task-related studies of brain activity, partly due to challenges surrounding controlling and recording self-generated thought. Recent advances suggest that a neural activation gradient underlies transitions between external and internally focused cognitive states, separating opposing activation/deactivation of frontoparietal control and default mode networks along a continuum. To characterize internal cognitive states associated with this neural gradient, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while participants imagined a variety of personal scenarios prompted by generic text cues (e.g., party, housework), mimicking self-generated thought. Prior to scanning, participants verbally described the scenarios and rated their experiential features. Gradient-space analysis identified a cognitive transition between imagining (not undertaking) solitary activities (e.g., housework), which activated the frontoparietal network relative to the default mode network, and social activities (e.g., party), which exhibited the reverse pattern. Because all states were internally focused (i.e. imagined) and were self-generated under the same (non-interactive) task, these findings refine the cognitive interpretation of the frontoparietal to default mode gradient, showing that it does not strictly differentiate between external (task-positive) and internal (task-negative) cognitive states.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

Methods: We employed an in vitro BBB model by co-culturing brain-specific microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMECs) differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and primary human brain vasculature pericytes (hBVPs). Protein expression under solo- versus co-culture conditions was assessed by western blot. MMP enzymatic activity in the culture media was measured by fluorometric assay. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media and brain derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) concentrations were determined using ELISA assays. Results: TIMP1 and collagen-IV expression was significantly increased in co-cultured BBB endothelial cells and pericytes compared to solo-cultures. However, a greater effect was observed in cells co-cultured for 2 days than 7 days. Elevated TIMP1 in co-culture media significantly inhibited MMP activity. The AKT and ERK pathways were activated in both cell types after 7 days of co-culture, and the ERK signaling mediated TIMP1 upregulation in endothelial cells. BDNF was significantly enriched in exosomes isolated from co-culture media on the abluminal side compared to the solo-cultures. Endothelial cells also protected pericytes from accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta 42 by downregulating low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) expression. Conclusions: These findings provide mechanistic insights into BBB disruption due to pericyte degeneration and highlight the important role of BBB insulin resistance in causing cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}

This coordination can align transcriptional shifts across metabolic pathways using cis-regulatory elements shared across the enzyme genes within these pathways. While the role of transcription factors (TFs) in controlling this process across pathways is well known, less is known regarding the role of shared cis-regulatory elements across the genes in a pathway. Sharing cis-regulatory elements across the genes in an enzyme complex or pathway, can create coordinated regulation of the pathway by a TF. However, it is unclear if all the genes in a pathway or enzyme complex need to be fully coordinated for maximal function. For example, if one gene in an enzyme complex loses a cis-regulatory element, it may not alter the function of the enzyme complexes function if post-transcriptional or compensatory transcriptional changes are sufficient to balance the complex. To test how cis-modular membership shapes the function of an enzyme complex, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to abolish a common cis-regulatory element across the promoters of nine genes required for the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC). This complex is composed of three apoenzymes and is a central hub coordinating carbon flow between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Different combinations of these cis-element mutations were tested across the genes in the complex in Arabidopsis thaliana and the created genotypes were phenotyped for altered enzyme function using digital growth analysis, disease assays, metabolomics, and transcriptomics. This analysis revealed that mutating cis-element motifs of genes in this enzyme complex produced distinct phenotypes, displaying promoter-specific buffering and modularity.", "date": "2025-11-25", "journal": ""}
