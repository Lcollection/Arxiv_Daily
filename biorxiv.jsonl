We used genetic ablation and antibody depletion to dissect key CD4+ T cell/B cell receptor-ligand pair interactions to define the critical signals that govern the development of specific MBC populations. While it has previously been suggested that germinal center (GC) experience is required for the development of CD73+CD80+ MBCs that rapidly form secondary plasmablasts, highly functional IgM+ MBCs differentiate in a BCL6 and CD4+ T cell-dependent, but GC-independent manner. BCL6 upregulation, in the presence or absence of a GC, can therefore serve as a predictor of long-lived, functional MBCs.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

However, it is not known which inputs are altered. Here we used a rabies virus (RABV)-based mapping strategy to quantify RABV-labeled inputs to VTA cells after a single exposure to one of a variety of misused drugs - cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, morphine, and nicotine - and compared the relative global input labeling across conditions. We observed that all tested addictive drugs elicited similar input changes onto VTADA cells, in particular onto DA cells projecting to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. In addition, repeated administration of ketamine/xylazine to induce anesthesia induces a change in inputs to VTADA cells that is similar to but different from those elicited by a single exposure to addictive drugs, suggesting that caution should be taken when using ketamine/xylazine-based anesthesia in rodents when assessing motivated behaviors. Furthermore, comparison of viral tracing data to an atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain showed that the basal expression patterns of several gene classes, especially calcium channels, were highly correlated with the extent of both addictive drug- or ketamine/xylazine-induced changes in RABV-labeled inputs to VTADA cells. Reducing expression levels of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cacna1e in cells in the nucleus accumbens lateral shell reduced RABV-mediated input labeling of these cells into VTADA cells. These results directly link genes controlling cellular excitability and the extent of input labeling by RABV.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that both synthetic and endogenous nuclear condensates exhibit critical-like interfacial behaviors near the phase boundary, including enhanced capillary fluctuations, critical slowing down, and reduced surface tension. By combining optogenetic control with sub-micron-resolution fluctuation spectroscopy, we quantitatively estimate surface tension, bending rigidity, and effective viscosity. Surface tension diminishes as the system approaches the critical composition, consistent with classical theories of phase separation. Notably, bending elasticity emerges as an unexpected feature of these nuclear liquid-like structures, suggesting the formation of structured interfacial layers that progressively weaken near criticality. Among these condensates, the nucleolus displayed exceptionally high viscosity, which may arise in part from viscoelastic coupling to the surrounding perinucleolar heterochromatin, effectively increasing the apparent viscosity in the long-time fluctuation regime. This non-invasive approach enables probing condensate mechanics in living cells and may provide a basis for diagnosing or modulating condensates in biomedical contexts.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

We focused on epigenomic regulation of this process by analyzing the changes of chromatin marks and gene expression in leukemic cell clones as they progressed towards increased proliferation in a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This progression was characterized by gradual modulation of chromatin states and gene expression across the genome, with a surprising preferential trend of reversing the prior changes associated with the origins of leukemia. Our analyses of this modulation in independently developing clones predicted a small set of potential growth regulators whose transcriptomic and epigenomic progression was consistent between clones and maintained both in vivo and ex vivo. We selected three of these genes as candidates (Irx5 and Plag1 as growth suppressors and Smad1 as a driver) and successfully validated their causal growth effects by overexpression in leukemic cells.

ATTRwt generally manifests as cardiomyopathy, whereas ATTRv may present as polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy, or mixed, in combination with many other symptoms deriving from multisystem organ involvement. Over 220 different mutational variants of transthyretin have been identified, many of them being linked to specific disease symptoms. Yet, the role of these mutations in explaining differential disease manifestations remains unclear. Using cryo-electron microscopy, here we structurally characterized fibrils from the heart and the liver of an ATTRv patient carrying the V122{Delta} mutation, which is predominantly associated with polyneuropathy.

Here we demonstrate that midbrain dopamine neurons form a circuit to the spleen via a multi-synaptic pathway from the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) through the celiac ganglion. Midbrain dopamine neurons modulate the activity of D1- and D2-like dopamine receptor-expressing DVC neurons. In vivo activation of midbrain dopamine neurons induced dopamine release in the DVC and increased immediate early gene expression in both the DVC and celiac ganglion. Activation of this midbrain-to-spleen circuit reduced spleen weight and decreased naive CD4+ T-cell populations without affecting total T-cell numbers. These findings unveil a functional midbrain-DVC-celiac ganglion-spleen pathway, through which midbrain dopamine neurons modulate splenic immunity.

However, these approaches are often purely descriptive, have limited generalizability, and do not elucidate the underlying generative mechanisms that shape the regional organization of the brain. Here, we develop a novel approach that leverages a simple, hierarchical principle for generating a multiscale parcellation of any brain structure in any mammalian species using only its geometry. We show that this approach yields regions at any resolution scale that are more homogeneous than those defined in nearly all existing benchmark brain parcellations in use today across hundreds of anatomical, functional, cellular, and molecular brain properties measured in humans, macaques, marmosets, and mice. We additionally show how our method can be generalized to previously unstudied mammalian species for which no parcellations exist. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach captures the essence of a simple, hierarchical reaction-diffusion mechanism, in which the geometry of a brain structure shapes the spatial expression of putative patterning molecules linked to the formation of distinct regions through development. Our findings point to a highly conserved and universal influence of geometry on the regional organization of the mammalian brain.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Tuft cells are known for their tall, blunt microvilli, thought to be analogous to mechanosensory hair cell stereocilia; however, a functional role for the microvillar apparatus has not been identified. POU2F3 is the master regulator transcription factor for tuft cells, yet how POU2F3 drives formation of this unique structure is unknown. Here, we aimed to identify POU2F3 target genes and commonalities between tuft and hair cells to better understand this unique structure. METHODS: POU2F3 ChIP-seq was performed on tuft cells and compared to the hair cell transcriptome. Tuft cell RNA-seq datasets were interrogated for hair cell structural and mechanosensory genes; expression was validated. Intestinal and gallbladder tuft cells were examined using multiple light and electron microscopy (EM) modalities. PCDH20 was knocked down in mouse models and ultrastructural analyses were performed. The tuft cell cytoskeleton was modeled using AlphaFold3 prediction. RESULTS: Genes encoding structural and mechanosensory proteins common to both tuft and hair cells, including Pcdh20, were identified. Imaging localized PCDH20 to tuft cell microvilli and hair cell stereocilia. Genetic ablation of Pcdh20 in mice resulted in structural defects in tuft cell microvilli, including loss of rigidity and organization. Molecular modeling suggests PCDH20 homodimers link adjacent microvilli. CONCLUSIONS: Pcdh20 is a POU2F3 target gene in tuft cells, critical to maintain the rigid microvillar apparatus.

We present OpenIrisDPI, an open-source plugin for the OpenIris framework that implements dual Purkinje image (DPI) tracking. OpenIrisDPI supports simultaneous pupillography, a technique widely used in perceptual psychology and neuroscience, and it enables direct comparison between P-CR and DPI signals. Data collected from macaque monkeys using OpenIrisDPI show that the P-CR method overestimates the amount of fixational drift between saccades compared to DPI. The accuracy of the DPI signal was further validated using high-density extracellular recording of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Compensating for the effects of fixational eye movements using DPI signals produced sharper estimates of neuronal receptive fields than using simultaneously collected P-CR signals. OpenIrisDPI is provided as open-source software and operates on consumer-grade hardware, making it more accessible than previously described DPI eye trackers and less costly than many P-CR systems.

Implicit learning of movement sequences (i.e., their specific ordinal and temporal structure) is vital for performing complex motor behavior and lays the foundation for performing daily activities and interacting socially.

We utilized the serial reaction time task to assess implicit motor sequence learning and the Corsi block-tapping test to assess visuospatial short-term and working memory. We also recorded resting state electroencephalography (EEG). While implicit motor learning was evident at the group level, longer cannabis use was associated with a smaller index of motor learning and increased activity in beta and gamma EEG frequencies during resting state. The cannabis group also had a significantly shorter Corsi span (in both forward and backward conditions). These findings indicate that longer chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired implicit motor learning that may be a function of increased resting state neural oscillatory activity, resulting in increased cortical noise, and reduced visuospatial short-term and working memory. These findings suggest that chronic cannabis use may disrupt corticostriatal pathways that underlie implicit motor sequence learning, indicating a more extensive effect of cannabis on the motor system.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Informed by our experience, we have developed a statistics-driven framework for stimulation testing to identify therapeutic targets. Materials and Methods: Fourteen participants (major depressive disorder = 6, chronic pain = 6, obsessive-compulsive disorder = 2) underwent inpatient testing using sEEG and symptom monitoring to identify personalized stimulation targets for subsequent DBS implantation. We present a structured approach to this sEEG testing, integrating a Stimulation Testing Decision Tree with power analysis and effect size considerations to inform adequately powered results to detect therapeutic stimulation sites with statistical rigor. Results: Effect sizes (Hedges' g) of stimulation-induced symptom score changes ranged from -1.5 to +2.39. The standard deviation of sham trial responses was a strong predictor of stimulation response variability, as confirmed by a leave-one-out cross-validated linear regression (R2 = 0.67, permutation p<0.001). Thus, early sham trial data could be used to estimate the variability of stimulation responses for power analysis calculations. We show that approximately 10 sham trials were needed to robustly estimate sham variability. Power analysis (using a paired-t test) showed that for effect sizes [&ge;] 1.1, roughly 10 trials should be used per stimulation site for sufficiently powered results.

Recently a family of structural stability approaches that determine the range of intrinsic growth rates compatible with system feasibility have been gaining popularity as a measure of how likely a community is able to persist in fluctuating conditions. This offers a theoretical basis for understanding and predicting the assembly and stability of complex multi-species communities from only interaction network structures. However, here I show that the high sensitivity of calculations of the feasibility domain, coupled with empirical uncertainties inherent in estimated interaction strength, are likely to preclude the approach's reliable application to empirical settings as a metric to compare the stability of different communities. Across four reanalyses of previous empirical demonstrations of the structural stability approach, more parsimonious measures based on species connectance provide better explanations for patterns of community assembly or differences in stability. Calculation of structural stability metrics therefore appears to lose, rather than synthesise, information embedded in empirical interaction matrices. This success of simpler measures is good news for the purposes of prediction and emphasises the value of multiple-competing hypotheses in validation tests to demonstrate value-added associated with new approaches.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Many autologous cell therapies are individually manufactured for each patient using traditional manual methods in high-cost environments. Therefore, robotics and automation offer a potential solution to meet the growing demand for such therapies. To ensure identical biological outcomes, automation must replicate validated manual workflows, a requirement that poses significant engineering challenges, especially for aseptic manipulation and compatibility with manual-centric instruments and consumables. Here we describe the design and performance of a modular robotic cluster consisting of specialized modules containing widely adopted equipment. The robotic arm uses custom end-effectors to handle standard consumables and instruments such as syringes, vials, bags, cell counters, bioreactors, incubators, and closed centrifuges. We compared the performance of skilled human operators against the robotic cluster across multiple tasks: transferring cells between sterile bags, cell counting, drawing volume from a vial to a syringe, and resuspension and sampling from both a bag and G-Rex 100M-CS bioreactor. The robotic system also executed high-complexity operations with industry-standard instruments: cell selection using a CytoSinct 1000 and wash/buffer exchange with a CTS Rotea Counterflow centrifugation system. Experimental results for each unit operation show that the robotic cluster's performance is equivalent to manual operations on the selected key metrics. These data demonstrate that the robotic system can efficiently and robustly perform specific unit operations, which can be combined in any order for end-to-end cell therapy manufacturing processes.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

These systems are categorized into types and are highly diverse. Genomes often harbor multiple CRISPR arrays varying in length and distance from Cas loci. However, the ecological roles of multiple CRISPR arrays and their interactions with multiple Cas loci remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive analysis of CRISPR systems that uncovers variation between diverse Cas types regarding the occurrence of multiple arrays, the distribution of their lengths and positions relative to Cas loci, and the diversity of their repeat sequences. Some types tend to occur as the sole Cas locus present in the genome, but typically have two or more associated arrays, especially for types I-E and I-F. Multiple Cas types are also common, with some systems showing a preference for specific co-occurrence. Distinct array distributions and orientations around Cas loci indicate substantial differences in functionality and transcriptional behavior among Cas types. Our analysis suggests that arrays with identical repeats in the same genome acquire new spacers at comparable rates, irrespective of their proximity to the Cas locus. Furthermore, repeat similarities indicate that arrays of systems that often co-occur with other systems tend to have more diverse repeats than those mostly appearing alongside solitary systems. Our results indicate that co-occurring Cas type pairs might not only collaborate in spacer acquisition but also maintain independent and complementary functions and that CRISPR systems distribute their defensive spacer repertoire equally across multiple CRISPR arrays.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

(marijuana, hemp, cannabis) is an angiosperm species currently evolving sex chromosomes. Genetic mechanisms, primarily an XY chromosome system, dictate cannabis sex expression in dioecious populations. However, sexual expression is also governed by the interplay of hormone regulatory gene networks, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Within the species, some populations exhibit dioecy, monoecy, or a gradient of both. Dioecious individuals produce exclusively male or female flowers, while monoecious plants bear both male and female flowers. Remarkably, through interruption of phytohormone signal transduction via abiotic stressors, genetically male or female cannabis are able to produce flowers of the opposite sex. Previous transcriptomic analysis have identified genes associated with masculinization through the application of phytohormone signal disruption using silver thiosulfate treatment. We analyzed transcriptomic data from cannabis treated with colloidal silver to similarly induce masculinization. Using Nota (Network Ontology Transcript Annotation), a multilayer network analysis (random walk with restart) tool, we identified candidate genes involved in sex-determination. Nota and a companion program Jack facilitate multi-layer network analyses, enabling discovery and annotation of gene-trait associations. Our findings highlight Nota's robust application to enrich the genetic architecture of complex traits, particularly in non-model systems like cannabis, and complex traits such as sex determination. Our analyses identified genes associated with cell wall morphogenesis and embryogenic tissue homeostasis, indicating that silver ion treatment perturbs phytohormone signal transduction through metal ion imbalance.

After widespread deployment of the Cf-9 resistance locus, breeders increasingly relied on Cf-6, yet Cf-6-mediated resistance has already been overcome in multiple regions. The molecular basis of this breakdown, and the identity of the matching avirulence (Avr) effector, have remained unresolved. Here, we use comparative genomics and functional genetics to identify the F. fulva effector Avr6 as the previously described apoplastic protein Ecp5. Sequencing of Cf-6-breaking strains revealed either deletion of the Ecp5 locus or non-synonymous mutations in its coding sequence. Using transient expression, targeted gene knockout, and complementation assays, we show that Ecp5 is both necessary and sufficient for Cf-6-mediated recognition and defence activation. We then use Avr6-triggered cell death as a phenotypic marker in a bulked segregant analysis combined with Comparative Subsequence Sets analysis (CoSSa) to map Cf-6 to a [~]2 Mb interval on the short arm of chromosome 12 that overlaps the previously described Cf-Ecp5.12 locus. Sequencing of Avr6 in a broad strain collection reveals a predominantly conserved allele under apparent purifying selection, with recent independent loss-of-function variants in Europe and South America that confer virulence on Cf-6 plants. Together, these findings establish the Avr6-Cf-6 gene-for-gene pair, explain the erosion of Cf-6-mediated resistance, and illustrate how effector loss or mutation provides a rapid route for F. fulva adaptation, with important implications for designing more durable resistance strategies against tomato leaf mold.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Host behaviors (e.g., diet) provide a regular source of environmental variation that induces fluctuations in the abundances of resident microbiota. Despite these displacements, microbial community members remain highly resilient. Population abundances tend to fluctuate around characteristic steady-state abundances over long timescales in healthy human hosts. These temporary excursions from steady-state abundances, known as sojourn trajectories, have the potential to inform our understanding of the fundamental dynamics of the microbiome. However, to our knowledge, the macroecology of sojourn trajectories has yet to be systematically characterized. In this study, we leverage theoretical tools from the study of random walks to characterize the duration of sojourn trajectories, their shape, and the degree that diverse community members exhibit similar qualitative and quantitative dynamics. We apply the Stochastic Logistic Model as a theoretical lens for interpreting our empirical observations. We find that the typical timescale of a sojourn trajectory does not depend on the mean abundance of a community member (i.e., carrying capacity), although it is strongly related to its coefficient of variation (i.e., environmental noise).

Prior work shows that the body and technology are represented simultaneously, but little is known about how these representations evolve dynamically across different sensorimotor interaction phases. To fill this gap, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built wearable finger-extension device that elongated users' fingers by 10 cm, spatially augmenting their reachable workspace. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after device wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task to measure representations of the biological and artificial fingers. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, wearing the finger-extension device led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, after active use, the represented lengths of the biological and artificial fingers stretched significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a post-removal aftereffect on the biological finger representation was observed. These results demonstrate that wearable finger extensions that provide spatial augmentation are rapidly integrated into body representations, with dynamic proprioceptive adjustments shaped by structural and functional properties of the device.

However, it remains unclear whether training-based learning (training effect) and transfer/generalization-based learning (transfer effect) rely on shared neural mechanisms or whether they represent distinct processes supported by different cortical architectures. Here, we employed between-subject multivariate decoding of hyperaligned functional magnetic resonance imaging data to characterize the universal neural codes underlying the training and transfer effects and their resultant motor engrams in the sensorimotor cortex. We found that both learning processes are encoded bilaterally but shifted to the right (ipsilateral) hemisphere, with the training effect showing higher decoding accuracy than the transfer effect. The bilateral central sulci showed a clear mechanism-specificity towards the training effect, in contrast to the rest of the sensorimotor cortex. Interestingly, these learning processes consolidate two distinct motor engrams. Remarkably, the information structure of these processes is shared among individual brains, and the between-subject classification provided limited results when performed with standard, anatomical alignment. Our findings support the notion that motor skill learning is hierarchically organized in the sensorimotor cortex, and extend current models by revealing that training and transfer encode distinct and mechanism-dependent high-dimensional representations embedded in a neural code that is shared across brains.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Most current classification models rely on a two-step pipeline: a detector first locates and crops animals, followed by a classifier that predicts species independently for each crop. While effective, these models still struggle under challenging conditions and ignore temporal context or information from nearby animals available in sequences of camera trap images, whereas human annotators often use it in difficult cases. We propose to leverage self-attention, a core mechanism of Large Language Models and Vision Transformers, to enable the model to learn relationships between crops occurring in similar contexts. Our self-attention module operates directly on the set of crop embeddings, producing new representations enriched with information from other crops, improving species classification. The module fits into the two-step pipeline without requiring structural change and adds only minimal computational overhead. To address the lack of annotated multi-species sequences, we develop a training strategy that synthetically generates multi-species sequences from mono-specific ones. Compared to an independent classifier baseline, our multi-crop model achieves higher accuracy on mono-specific sequences, both real and synthetic. In multi-species settings, evaluated using synthetic test sets, we also observe a substantial improvement in accuracy. Using real but weakly annotated multi-species sequences, we reformulate the task as multi-label set classification, and conduct a visual analysis, to highlight the benefits of our approach. By leveraging the information brought by all detections of animals in the image and others of the same sequence, our approach reduces species misclassifications and enables more accurate estimates for downstream ecological analyses focusing on, for instance, species richness, occupancy, and species interaction.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Instead of invaginating as a continuous sheet, the separated membranes extend independently to partition the cytoplasm. The membrane rupture and independent extension of sister membranes create membrane discontinuities--widely observed in electron microscopy (EM) sections.

Several methods for determining PQ-redox have been established. Although some of these methods may be quantitative, such as those based on liquid chromatography, they are typically sensitive to sample preparation. Here, we critically evaluate the use of fast chlorophyll a fluorescence induction kinetics (the so-called OJIP transient) for semi-quantitative PQ-redox estimation in green algae (Chlorella vulgaris) and cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803). The method, based on the evaluation of relative fluorescence yield at the J-step of the OJIP transient (VJ, VJ), has already been reported; however, thus far, it has been used mostly for studying dark-acclimated leaves, which limits its range of application. Here, we show that the OJIP transient can be used for semi-quantitative estimation of PQ-redox in algal and cyanobacterial cell cultures, in addition to plants. We further show that it can reflect PQ-redox in both dark-acclimated and light-acclimated samples. Our systematic comparison of Multi-Color PAM, AquaPen, and FL 6000 fluorometers demonstrates that accurate measurement of VJ and VJ parameters in suspension cultures requires low culture density and a high-intensity saturation pulse. We further show that with increasing light intensity to which the cells are exposed, the state of photosystem II (PSII) changes due to light-induced reduction of quinone A (QA-) and conformational changes, which in turn influence both the sensitivity and dynamic range of the VJ parameter towards PQ-redox estimation. A comparison of fluorescence transients in Chlorella and Synechocystis revealed high homeostatic control over PQ-redox in Synechocystis, maintained by terminal oxidases present at the thylakoid membrane. While we discuss certain limitations, our systematic assessment suggests that the OJIP method has great potential to become a routine tool for semi-quantitative PQ-redox estimation under a wide range of experimental conditions in green algae and cyanobacteria.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

The bleomycin induced fibrosis model is widely used as an experimental model of SSc. Here, we investigated whether bleomycin selectively disrupts centromeres and whether such damage contributes to chromosome instability and immunogenic chromatin mislocalization. Methods: We evaluated centromere integrity and downstream genome damage-response phenotypes across complementary systems: the bleomycin mouse model of skin fibrosis, hTERT-immortalized human fibroblasts, and primary dermal fibroblasts from SSc patients. Centromeric -satellite copy number, DNA damage and repair markers, micronuclei, nuclear envelope rupture, and colocalization of centromeric chromatin with antigen presentation machinery were assessed by qPCR, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Results: Bleomycin induced selective depletion of -satellite repeats at centromeres in mouse skin. In human fibroblasts, bleomycin generated double-strand breaks by {gamma}H2AX foci that preferentially colocalized with CENP-A-marked active centromeres and produced persistent centromere loss. Damage signaling required ATM and relied mainly on RAD51-mediated homologous-recombination repair, yet centromere restoration remained incomplete. Bleomycin also increased micronuclei, cytoplasmic centromeric foci, and BANF1-marked nuclear-envelope rupture, consistent with mis-segregation-driven chromatin leakage. CENP-B colocalized with HLA-DRB1 in bleomycin-treated fibroblasts and limited cutaneous SSc (lccSSc) fibroblasts, revealing centromere-derived antigen-presentation signatures. Conclusions: This study identifies active centromeres as selectively vulnerable and incompletely repaired targets of bleomycin-induced DNA damage and demonstrates that centromere instability produces mislocalized chromatin capable of engaging antigen-presentation pathways.

We discover that at a wide range of cellular concentrations, -synuclein is highly biased toward formation of a membrane-bound amphiphilic helix that imparts toxicity. Population of this toxic state can be disrupted by mutations that reduce membrane affinity, which shift the folding equilibrium away from the membrane-bound state. Reduced-affinity variants exhibit distinct sensitivity to concentration relative to variants with WT-like affinity, likely because these variants are expressed at concentrations closer to their dissociation constant for membrane binding.

The recent revolution in protein structure prediction now enables analagous large-scale analyses for proteins. Here, we use the structure prediction algorithm ESMFold to systematically investigate the mutational profiles of natural, random, and de novo proteins. Unlike RNA, where functional and random sequences share similar mutational profiles, natural proteins are substantially more robust than random amino acid sequences, suggesting an evolutionary drive toward robustness. They also exhibit limited structural variation among close sequence neighbours, potentially constraining access to new folds.

Both dendritic motility of late endosomes and somatic degradation require RAB7A. Similarly, interference with dynein function reduces motility of late endosomes and results in degradative failure. Blocking dynein function also impairs normal dendrite growth, suggesting that motility of late endosomes and/or lysosomes might be required for dendrite growth. RAB7A and dynein are mechanistically linked via RILP which is a dynein-interacting RAB7A effector. RILP also binds the late endosome-lysosome fusion tether HOPS. In non-neuronal cells, downregulation of RILP leads to impaired degradation due to deficiencies in late endosome transport and fusion defects with lysosomes. In this work, we express a separation-of-function mutant of RAB7A (RAB7A-L8A) incapable of RILP binding. Based on the results in non-neuronal cells, we hypothesized that both endosome motility and degradation in neurons depended on RILP. Our data in cultured rat and mouse hippocampal neurons of both sexes suggest that endogenous RILP is a functional RAB7A-dependent dynein adaptor for late endosome motility in dendrites. Interestingly, it also promotes endosome carrier formation. As a consequence of late endosome transport inhibition, degradative cargos are not cleared normally from dendrites in RAB7A-L8A. Surprisingly, lysosomal fusion and somatic degradation do not require RAB7A-RILP interactions.

However, they often overlook crucial aspects of adaptation, including the long-term temporal evolutionary dynamics, the predictability of evolutionary outcomes, the influence of past evolution on future evolutionary trajectories (contingency), and the diversity of molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation. Experimental evolution has been a useful tool for answering these questions, but extracting fundamental principles and predictive features of evolutionary outcomes from these datasets remains challenging due to the large number of covariates and confounding effects, such as differences in experimental setup, species lifestyle, gene content, and evolution rate. Here, we sought to circumvent these challenges by comparing distant yeast species that share several evolutionary features but differ mainly in evolutionary history and genome architecture, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Thus, we evolved 10 populations of the fission yeast for 10,000 generations in the same conditions as a pre-existing budding yeast dataset (i.e. high-sugar media and hypoxic conditions), allowing us to observe repeatable evolutionary outcomes within species but diverse molecular mechanisms and targets of adaptation across species. The most frequent adapting route in these conditions involved upregulating fermentation genes and downregulating the glycolysis gene pyk1, which has not previously been observed in S. cerevisiae evolved populations or in wild Kluyveromyces lactis, but similar evolutionary paths have been observed in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus and in clinically relevant populations, such as some cancer cells. This suggests that parallelism is pervasive in the tree of life and that mechanisms of adaptation can be shared among closely related or distant species. Despite similar gene content and identical environments, recurrent adaptation across S. pombe populations involved different genes than in S. cerevisiae and was mostly detectable at the transcriptomic level. This suggests that trans-regulatory effects may play an important role in adaptation on short evolutionary timescales and that differences in evolutionary outcomes between these species may be attributed to contingency.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Separated dyads emitted a distinct call repertoire consisting mainly of calls in or just above the human audible range (but not squeaks) as well as Noisy calls, and only to a lesser degree of USVs.

As a first step towards a mitogenome-based phylogeny of niphargids, we present here the first complete mitogenome sequence of Niphargus. To obtain high-accuracy mitogenome sequences and annotations, genome skimming of three individuals of Niphargus dolenianensis Lorenzi, 1898 was performed using both short, accurate reads (Illumina) and long, noisier reads (nanopore). Whereas the direct assembly of Illumina sequences yielded structurally incorrect mitogenome sequences, the assembly of nanopore reads produced highly accurate sequences that were corroborated by the mapping of Illumina reads. Polishing the nanopore consensus using Illumina reads corrected a handful of errors at the homopolymer level. The resulting mitogenome sequences ranged from 14,956 to 15,199 bp and shared the same arrangement of 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and a putative control region. Phylogenetic analyses based on protein-coding genes confirmed that the Niphargidae family is sister to Pseudoniphargidae, resolving their relationships with other amphipod families. This highlights the utility of mtDNA genome sequences for studying the evolution of this groundwater genus, and the refinement of new methodological approaches, such as nanopore sequencing, is promising for the study of its origin and diversification.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

However, noninvasive measurement of prefrontal activity remains challenging, limiting our understanding of how to optimize prefrontal treatments. Input-output relationships reveal how neural circuits respond to different inputs and are essential for determining optimal treatment parameters and understanding individual variability in treatment response, yet systematic investigation of prefrontal input-output relationships has been lacking. Objective: To characterize human prefrontal excitability with input-output (I/O) curves. Methods: We employed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography in a randomized mixed-block design with 28 healthy participants receiving single-pulse TMS to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) across 12 stimulation intensities (60-140% of resting motor threshold). We quantified prefrontal excitability using early local TMS-evoked potentials (EL-TEPs), cortical responses measured locally 20-60 ms post-stimulus. Results: We observed a strong effect of TMS intensity on prefrontal EL-TEP amplitudes. Sigmoidal EL-TEP I/O curves were observed in 57% of participants, with the sigmoidality partially explained by EL-TEP signal quality. Correlations were observed between EL-TEP and motor-evoked potential curve parameters, but intensity parameterization approaches did not significantly differ in explaining inter-individual EL-TEP response variability. Reliable EL-TEPs could be obtained using fewer TMS pulses at high intensities, and test-retest assessments revealed robust I/O curve profiles. Conclusions: These findings provide a systematic noninvasive characterization of prefrontal input-output physiology, establishing a framework for estimating prefrontal excitability. The comparison of various intensity parameterizations motivates the need for enhanced models and individualized measurement of stimulation responses.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Despite major advances in long-read sequencing technologies and graph-based assembly algorithms, current assemblies often remain incomplete and require refinement, including correction of haplotype switching and resolution of gaps, particularly within repetitive regions such as ribosomal DNA clusters and recent segmental duplications. These limitations largely stem from challenges in graph curation and are not adequately addressed by conventional polishing methods, which focus primarily on nucleotide-level corrections. To overcome these issues, we developed Verkko-Fillet, a Python-based interactive framework for genome graph inspection, editing, and curation that also provides step-by-step guidelines for downstream polishing. Verkko-Fillet takes as input Verkko output files, including the assembly graph, haplotype paths, Hi-C contacts, and additional ONT reads or alternative assemblies aligned to the graph, and offers tools for visualizing, modifying, and exporting curated assembly graphs. It enables users to track changes, resolve complex structural features, fill gaps, and enhance assembly quality beyond conventional polishing.

In this paper, we introduce GCP-VQVAE, a geometry-complete tokenizer built around a strictly SE(3)-equivariant GCPNet encoder that preserves orientation and chirality of protein backbones. We vector-quantize rotation/translation-invariant readouts that retain chirality into a 4,096-token vocabulary, and a transformer decoder maps tokens back to backbone coordinates via a 6D rotation head trained with SE(3)-invariant objectives. Building on these properties, we train GCP-VQVAE on a corpus of 24 million monomer protein backbone structures gathered from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. On the CAMEO2024, CASP15, and CASP16 evaluation datasets, the model achieves backbone RMSDs of 0.4377 AA, 0.5293 AA, and 0.7567 AA, respectively, and achieves 100% codebook utilization on a held-out validation set, substantially outperforming prior VQ-VAE-based tokenizers and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

K.; Zeng, L.", "abstract": "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second common neurodegenerative disorder, driven by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and pathological -synuclein protein accumulation. Currently, there is no disease-modifying therapy that can halt PD progression. Our previous study uncovered a critical pathogenic feed-forward loop between amyloid precursor protein (APP) and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), in which the two proteins mutually enhance each other's expression, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Targeting this vicious cycle represents a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. Methods: To discover novel inhibitors targeting this axis, we performed high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library using a fluorescence-based biosensor system. We identified Mitoxantrone hydrochloride (MH), an antineoplastic agent, as a lead compound that inhibits both APP and LRRK2 expression. Its efficacy was validated in cellular models, including patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Motor behavioural and safety assessments were subsequently conducted in PD mouse models. Results: We demonstrated that MH suppresses both APP and LRRK2 expression in various cell types in a dosage-dependent manner. In addition, MH also inhibits phosphorylation of LRRK2 and its downstream substrate Rab10. We further showed MH inhibits LRRK2 activity through direct binding to its kinase domain. Critically, MH treatment rescued dopaminergic neuron loss and reversed motor deficits in both 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced and LRRK2G2019S genetic PD mouse models. Moreover, we found that oral administration of MH is therapeutically effective, providing superior neuroprotection and behavioral recovery without detectable cardiotoxicity or gastrointestinal damage.

One might expect arteries and veins to arise simultaneously during development, as both are needed for a functional circulatory system. Nevertheless, arteries often precede veins in vivo, as exemplified by the first intraembryonic blood vessels. Here we present a model of vein differentiation that answers longstanding questions in the field. By reconstituting human vein endothelial cell (EC) differentiation from mesoderm in vitro, we discovered that vein development unfolds in two steps driven by opposing signals. First, VEGF is necessary to differentiate mesoderm into \"pre-vein\" ECs--a newly defined intermediate state--and to endow endothelial identity. Second, once cells have acquired pre-vein EC identity, VEGF/ERK inhibition is necessary to specify vein ECs. Pre-vein ECs co-expressed certain arterial (SOX17) and venous (APLNR) markers and harbored poised chromatin at future venous genes. However, VEGF/ERK inhibition was necessary to activate poised venous genes (e.g., NR2F2), and for pre-vein ECs to complete venous differentiation. Intersectional lineage tracing supported a pre-vein intermediate step in vivo: early Sox17+ Aplnr+ ECs also formed veins in mouse embryos. We leveraged this developmental knowledge for disease modeling by differentiating human pluripotent stem cells into artery and vein ECs, and comparing their responses to Ebola and Andes viruses under biosafety-level-4 containment. Artery and vein ECs responded divergently to the same virus, thus revealing that developmentally specified cell identity impacts viral infection. Taken together, we propose a two-step model for vein development wherein VEGF first differentiates mesoderm into pre-vein ECs, but subsequent VEGF/ERK inhibition generates vein ECs. VEGF activation is thought to be broadly essential for vascular development, and thus our discovery that VEGF/ERK inhibition specifies vein identity has potential implications for understanding current therapies that either activate or inhibit VEGF signaling.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

The reactivation of integrated PLVs mirrors the behavior of endogenous virophages in Cafeteria burkhardae, suggesting that specific Oceanusvirus-PLV compatibilities govern reactivation.

Aside from the VSDs, this membrane protein contains an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (CC) formed between the monomers. To address the need for direct measurements of conformational rearrangements in hHv1, we developed a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach to measuring the conformational rearrangements in full-length hHv1 purified from E. coli. We used genetic code expansion (GCE) to generate a library of 14 full-length hHv1 constructs, each incorporating the fluorescent noncanonical amino acid acridon-2-ylalanine (Acd) at a different site throughout the various structural domains. Following the expression and purification of these hHv1-Acd proteins, we found that 12 sites yielded stable and functional proton-permeable channels. The fluorescence properties of Acd at each site showed small site-specific differences. Furthermore, we measured site-specific FRET efficiencies from tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) to Acd in the hHv1-Acd proteins and found results consistent with correct folding in detergent micelles.

Encephalocele subsequently develops as a broad forebrain-midbrain swelling, visible from E11.5, that resolves by birth into a focal brain herniation resembling human parieto-occipital encephalocele. A structural analysis of the brain in mutant embryos reveals absence of the posterior commissure and sub-commissural organ, and at later stages the pineal gland. These structures normally develop just rostral to the forebrain-midbrain boundary, and Pax6 immuno-histochemistry demonstrates that this boundary remains intact in the mutant embryos. Histological analysis reveals a more general change in tissue composition of the neural tube roof in the forebrain-midbrain region, with diminished thickness of the neuroepithelium and increased thickness of the overlying layer, including the non-neural ectoderm (future epidermis). We conclude that the posterior commissure and sub-commissural organ, previously implicated in hydrocephalus, may also be fundamental for development of the earlier-arising brain malformation, encephalocele.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

There is, however, a discrepancy between our understanding of this code at the single-cell and population levels: direct measurements indicate the population code is high-dimensional, but established models of single-cell tuning give rise to low-dimensional codes. We reconciled this discrepancy by developing an AI science system to find a new parsimonious, interpretable equation for visual cortical orientation tuning. Candidate equations were expressed as short computer programs and evolved by Large Language Models (LLMs) using graphical diagnostics. The resulting equation not only improved single-cell fits, but also accurately modelled the population code's high-dimensional geometry. A novel parameter of the AI-discovered equation, which controls single-cell tuning smoothness, gives rise to high-dimensional population codes. The same parameter drives high-dimensional coding in head-direction cells, suggesting a common coding strategy across brain regions. We used this equation to hypothesize a circuit mechanism generating high-dimensional population codes, and to demonstrate the advantages of these codes in a simulated hyperacuity task. These results show that tuning smoothness has a key role in controlling population code geometry, and demonstrate how AI equation discovery can deliver interpretable models accelerating scientific understanding in neuroscience and beyond.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Gardnerella vaginalis, a common cervicovaginal anaerobe, alters cervicovaginal epithelial cell function, resulting in inflammatory immune responses and epithelial barrier breakdown.

Here we show microbe-specific alterations in cervicovaginal epithelial cell metabolite profiles where G. vaginalis, but not Lactobacillus crispatus, increases polyamine biosynthesis. Pretreatment with polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) globally shifts G. vaginalis-induced transcriptomic profiles. Alterations in transcripts encoding enzymes responsible for polyamine synthesis and catabolism provides further evidence that G. vaginalis modifies polyamine biosynthesis. Additionally, polyamine-mediated transcriptomic changes include genes related to bacterial defense, inflammation, and epigenetic processes. Polyamines mitigate G. vaginalis-induced inflammatory responses through reduction of cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases. The ability of cervicovaginal metabolites to alter microbe-mediated changes in epithelial cell function suggests that metabolite-microbe interactions are critical mediators of epithelial defense against a Lactobacillus-deplete microbiota.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a stress-responsive feedback loop between the E3 ligase TRIM28 and the demethylase ALKBH2. TRIM28 directly binds ALKBH2 and mediates its K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, whereas ALKBH2 enhances TRIM28 transcription, forming a reciprocal loop that regulates their steady-state levels. Alkylation stress triggers a biphasic response: acute MMS exposure increases TRIM28-ALKBH2 complex formation, further augmented by MAGEA6, and accelerates ALKBH2 degradation, whereas prolonged MMS treatment induces K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TRIM28, leading to ALKBH2 stabilization and increased ALKBH2 transcription. Clinically, ALKBH2 is elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and correlates with poorer survival, whereas TRIM28 shows prognostic association only in chemotherapy-treated patients. Functionally, combining MMS with cisplatin increases DNA damage, reduces clonogenic survival, and attenuates ALKBH2-dependent tolerance to alkylation damage, linking the TRIM28-ALKBH2 axis to chemotherapy response in NSCLC.

Furthermore, the rise of single-cell foundation models creates opportunities to harness external biological knowledge for guiding model embeddings. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding and interpretation for scRNA-seq analysis. Through embedding clustering regularization method, each topic is constrained to be the center of a separately aggregated gene cluster, enabling it to capture unique biological information. Across 20 scRNA-seq datasets, scE2TM achieves superior clustering performance compared with seven state-of-the-art methods. A comprehensive interpretability benchmark further shows that scE2TM-learned topics exhibit higher diversity and stronger consistency with underlying biological pathways. Modeling interferon-stimulated PBMCs, scE2TM simulates topic perturbations that drive control cells toward stimulated-like transcriptional states, faithfully mirroring experimental interferon responses.

Dynamic internal representations spanning from visual registration to state estimation were unveiled in both areas, with the goal for the interception being inferred as the visual consequence of the movement. The motion extrapolation was found to be an intrinsic part of movement planning, so that the continuous and stable spatial extrapolation from motion to action was prevalent in both areas. The goal estimation based on the sensory extrapolation rationalized the concurrency and correlation of saliency and intentional maps, which were found to switch their dominance by reorganizing the read-out dimensions of the spatial manifold.

We previously showed that anti-CD4 autoantibodies from people with HIV (PWH) on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) can mediate cytotoxicity against CD4+ T cells, implicating a role in impaired immune reconstitution. Despite viral suppression, many PWH with poor CD4 recovery exhibit chronic immune activation, microbial translocation, and dysregulated humoral immunity. Here, we identify a female-predominant elevation of plasma anti-CD4 IgG autoantibodies in aviremic PWH receiving ART. Across two independent cohorts, HIV-positive females, but not males, displayed significantly higher anti-CD4 IgG, predominantly IgG1, compared with HIV-negative controls, without parallel increases in anti-CD4 IgA or IgM. This sex-specific pattern was unique to anti-CD4 IgG and was not observed for anti-CD8 IgG, anti-double-stranded DNA IgG, or anti-nuclear antigen IgG; these control autoantibodies correlated with one another but not with anti-CD4 IgG. Elevated anti-CD4 IgG levels were associated with lower plasma progesterone levels and reduced absolute CD4+ T-cell counts. Markers of microbial translocation, soluble CD14 (sCD14), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were also selectively increased in HIV-positive females, with sCD14 and LBP showing significant or borderline associations with anti-CD4 IgG.

This phasic pupil dilation first appeared after movement onset but gradually shifted to precede it through environmental interaction, reflecting the emergence of action preparation and prediction of action outcomes. This shift also implies that infants are capable of anticipating the timing of their forthcoming movements.

Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I-Related molecule (MR1) is a conserved nonclassical antigen presenting molecule that presents ligands derived from microbial riboflavin synthesis to Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells. While endosomal trafficking facilitates MR1 antigen presentation during Mtb infection, the exact mechanisms by which MR1 loading of Mtb-derived ligands occurs are not known. We found that trafficking through sorting endosomes mediates MR1 antigen presentation during Mtb infection. Sorting endosomes utilize trafficking proteins such as Syntaxin 6, Syntaxin 12, Syntaxin 16 and VAMP4. Prior work demonstrates the importance of VAMP4 for MR1 presentation during Mtb infection; we have found that Stx12 and Stx16 are also important. Interference with Stx12 or Stx16 via siRNA-mediated knockdown reduces MR1 antigen presentation of Mtb. Using RFP-tagged constructs, we found Stx16 co-localized more with MR1 vesicles compared to Stx12 in MR1-GFP expressing airway epithelial cells. Stx12 and Stx16 blockade increase MR1 surface stabilization and total expression, indicating that impaired endosomal trafficking hinders MR1 internalization.

Quiescence requires the inhibition of mTORC1, a kinase complex that promotes growth and suppresses autophagy, and cell cycle re-entry requires the reactivation of mTORC1. The pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 in quiescent stem cells by rapamycin prevents cell cycle re-entry and subsequent tissue regeneration. It is well established that pharmacological responses can vary across genetic backgrounds, however, the extent to which genetic variation can impact the quiescence response to rapamycin is unclear. Here, we tested the sensitivity of stem cell quiescence to rapamycin in different genetic backgrounds within the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. These analyses revealed substantial variation across different genetic backgrounds, indicating that genetic variation can modulate drug-induced effects on stem cell dynamics.

In this study, we explore the evolutionary response of the social parasitic butterfly Phengaris teleius to its host ant, Myrmica scabrinodis, taking advantage of a unique opportunity: the reintroduction of the butterfly in the Netherlands thirty years ago. We compared the degree of host mimicry and behavioural performance of caterpillars between the reintroduced and the Polish source population. After about thirty generations, chemical and vibroacoustical signal profiles have diverged. Chemical mimicry remained limited during the pre-adoption phase for both groups; however, in the post-adoption phase, the source population showed significantly higher chemical similarity to their local hosts. In contrast, reintroduced pre-adoption caterpillars evolved vibroacoustic signals closely resembling local hosts, also resulting in a stronger response from their local host ants. This suggests that adoption is driven by acoustics and subsequently serves as a selective filter promoting post-entry chemical refinement. Behavioural data evince that despite the differences between the different communication channels, the combination of signals remains sufficient to ensure recognition and integration in both host-parasite systems.

Symbiodiniaceae diversity and community composition within two massive species (Porites lutea and P. lobata), whose identities were verified through morphometric examinations, were examined across 200 km of Ningaloo World Heritage Reef, Australia. Contrary to previous studies showing low diversity of high-fidelity symbionts, we found significant variability within Cladocopium, which differed significantly across host species, reef sites, and temperature metrics. Locations with broader temperature ranges and a greater number of extreme accumulated heat stress events (measured as [&ge;] 8 Degree Heating Weeks) exhibited significantly higher prevalence and abundance of thermotolerant Cladocopium C116. Community structure also varied significantly by the number of DHW events per location, where a low level of disturbance (1-3 events) resulted in a relatively lower community diversity compared to sites with 3-6 and 6-9 events. The southernmost and coolest site (in terms of Maximum Monthly Mean) harboured the greatest Symbiodiniaceae community diversity, whereas the northernmost and warmest site harboured the greatest Symbiodiniaceae sequence diversity.

Our findings demonstrate that seasonal characteristics mediate the effect of migration on coexistence and biomass production across meta-ecosystems.

Here, we investigate the evolutionary trajectory of A1 in birds, where both the presence of the gene and apoB RNA editing activity have been questioned. Through a comprehensive in silico analysis of 81 avian genomes, we identify recurrent disruptions and catalytic inactivation of A1 in multiple lineages. Comparative sequence and structural analyses reveal a lack of domains and key residues essential for RNA binding, dimerisation, and cofactor interaction, suggesting a role in DNA editing. Furthermore, genome-wide screening for A1-associated G-to-A mutations in long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons demonstrates that species with higher endogenous retrovirus (ERV) loads retain more DNA editing signatures, consistent with a defensive role of A1 against retroelements. In contrast, species with low ERV content exhibit relaxed selection and frequent A1 pseudogenisation.

In particular, the effect of resistance mutations was strongly dependent on genomic background, to the extent that mutations often reduced growth in one species but increased it in another (sign epistasis). Similarly, the effect of mutations on growth was strongly influenced by temperature, with some mutations increasing growth at one but decreasing growth at the other temperature. Most notably, three resistance mutations induced strong heat sensitivity in A. baylyi. Our results reinforce previous studies that report strong epistatic and GxE effects of resistance mutations, indicating that in the absence of additional data and more mechanistic models, predicting fitness effects of resistance mutations across species and environments can be very challenging.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Although hagfish are generally assumed to have experienced intense modifications, its brain development shows certain ancestral patterns that are secondarily lost in the lamprey. Therefore, hagfish provides key insights into the evolutionary origin and early diversification of the vertebrate brain. However, neuroanatomical information of the hagfish brain is substantially limited today due to its sources based on old-fashioned methodology alone. Here, we provide a detailed brain atlas of the adult hagfish, based on three-dimensional reconstruction and expression analysis of genetic markers for major neuronal transmitters. Through our analyses, we found the following key characteristics. First, the dopaminergic system appears to be distributed more broadly than previously thought in the hagfish brain, implying that dopamine is involved in various neural functions. Second, the previously suggested \"primordial cerebellum\" area in hagfish shows notable affinity to the cerebellum-like octavolateral structures of the jawed vertebrate hindbrain. Last, the gene expression profile suggests a hippocampus-equivalent brain region in hagfish, that is, the ventrolateral subnucleus of the central prosencephalic complex (NCvl). This study highlights conserved and diversified neuroarchitecture of the hagfish brain, providing a pivotal reference for further studies.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

We created a panel of 54 NILs and performed whole genome sequencing to precisely locate introgression segments(s) in each NIL. Deep sequencing largely confirmed prior knowledge of NIL genotypes but also identified multiple novel small introgressions and regions of residual heterozygosity. To illustrate the utility of this panel, we identified genomic regions underlying ecotypic differences in flowering time in a laboratory common garden experiment. We detected strong additive effects on flowering time in multiple NILs implicating the floral regulator FLC as expected based on previous quantitative trait locus studies. We also detected novel and complex contributions to ecotypic differences in flowering time, only visible in the NILs, hinting at contributions of epistatic effects. Our results highlight the utility of this panel for dissecting the genetic architecture of ecologically important traits, including the future potential for fine mapping of additive effects and testing for epistasis and linkage using NILs derived from the panel.

Building on the known scaling law that a single timescale, a cellular unit of time, governs stochastic growth and division of individual bacterial cells under constant growth conditions, here we show using experimental data that a dynamic rescaling of the cellular unit of time captures the predominant effect of temporal variations in environmental conditions. Furthermore, we identify the instantaneous exponential growth rate as the scaling factor that scales the internal clocks of the cells to the laboratory time. Our results reveal the natural representation for these time-dependent dynamics. When recast in its terms the cell age distribution for suitable initial conditions evolves under *time-invariant* rules even as growth conditions remain dynamic! Through the experimental realization at different temperatures of otherwise identical disruptive changes, we not only substantiate the general applicability of the cellular frame of reference but also uncover more emergent simplicities. Motivated by this representation, when time and instantaneous growth rate are expressed in terms of their naturally dimensionless counterparts, remarkably consistent patterns are revealed. These include a unimodal-bimodal-unimodal transition in the shape of the instantaneous growth rate distribution as cells initially in homeostasis experience a disruptive change in nutrient quality and subsequently recover and attain a new homeostasis. The remarkable scaling of the pattern of responses across temperatures suggests that the organizational rules and processes governing the response to disruptive change in nutrient quality remain the same at different temperatures. While the progression of the response appears to proceed at different tempos at different temperatures, upon shifting from the laboratory to the cellular frame of reference these changes progress at the same pace even at different temperatures.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

E.; Plastow, A. M.; Fink, M. R.; Dzuba, B.; Leblanc, M.-A.; Perkins, T. T.; Tajkhorshid, E.; Sousa, M. C.", "abstract": "Many gram-negative pathogens critically depend on the Type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into host cells for colonization. Because the channel of the T3SS is narrow ([~]2 nm), effectors must be unfolded for secretion. However, the T3SS is unable to unfold mechanically robust substrates (GFP, ubiquitin, and dihydrofolate reductase), severely impairing their secretion. Consistent with this, effectors are exceptionally mechanically labile, unfolding at very low forces. Thus, secretion competency is correlated with mechanical properties. Effector sequences have significantly diverged from non-effectors despite shared folds, suggesting that secretion exerts evolutionary pressure selecting mechanical lability. Here, using atomic-force-microscopy-based force spectroscopy, we show that effector NleC is mechanically labile (Funfold = 13.5 pN at 100 nm/s) and mechanically compliant, as characterized by a large distance to the transition state ({Delta}x{ddagger} = 2.7 nm). In contrast, the non-effector homolog protealysin is mechanically stable (Funfold = 50.7 pN at 100 nm/s) and more brittle ({Delta}x{ddagger} = 0.7 nm), comparable to proteins known to impair secretion (Funfold > 80 pN; {Delta}x{ddagger} < 0.4 nm). Denaturant-induced unfolding assays demonstrate that effectors exhibit rates typical of their fold, further reinforcing mechanical properties rather than intrinsically fast unfolding kinetics (k0) predicts secretion. Steered molecular dynamic simulations revealed NleC unfolding initiates at the N-terminus, consistent with current secretion models, whereas protealysin unfolding initiates at the C-terminus. Notably, the NleC N-terminus is primarily -helical while non-effector homologs contain {beta}-sheets, which may account for the distinct unfolding pathway. Together, these results are consistent with mechanical lability being an evolved, structurally encoded feature underlying effector secretion.\n\nSignificanceThe Type III secretion system delivers effector proteins directly into host cells to promote bacterial colonization. Effectors must be unfolded for secretion. This particular selective pressure is hypothesized to have driven significant sequence divergence from non-effector proteins despite maintaining the same fold. Here, we show that effectors are not characterized by unusually fast unfolding rates. Rather, effector NleC is more mechanically labile than its non-effector homolog, indicating mechanical lability underlies both effector sequence divergence and their unfolding. Simulations revealed that NleC unfolding initiates via the N-terminus consistent with the current secretion mechanism. Together, these results strongly suggest mechanical lability is an evolved property of effectors and provide structural insight into how it is encoded.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Candidate papers were then manually reviewed, and verified target genes were added to the updated database. This update also improved the predictive method by expanding the volume of high-throughput gene expression data and incorporating PPAR-related ChIP-seq datasets alongside in silico PPRE analysis.

In this work, we develop a mathematical and computational framework to analyze how shared translational resources (i.e., competition for ribosomes) affect protein neural networks implemented via molecular sequestration. Focusing on classification tasks, we show that ribosome competition primarily induces a rescaling of the neural network's effective weights, while preserving the shape of the decision boundary under identical mRNA-ribosome affinities. However, when these affinities are heterogeneous, limited resources lead to a bounded bending of the decision boundary, generating a well-defined uncertainty region. Importantly, classification remains reliable outside this region. Then, we extend our analysis from a perceptron to a multi-layer architectures (MLP), and illustrate that robustness to resource competition is maintained for an MLP with 2 nodes in the hidden layer.

Site-specific GlcNAc or high-mannose glycans at Asn359 or Asn410 remodel heparin and RNA binding kinetics in biolayer interferometry assays, revealing avidity-dominated, slow-off heparin interactions that are dampened by N-glycans and faster RNA interactions that can be potentiated by small GlcNAc modifications.

In the current study, we report that PARP1 levels are downregulated in aging mouse hearts, and PARP1 deficiency induces aging-related cardiac remodelling and contractile dysfunction in mice. PARP1 deficient mice hearts exhibit spontaneous activation of the Akt signalling pathway, leading to the development of aging-related cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Our findings reveal two distinct mechanisms by which PARP1 regulates Akt signalling, direct interaction of PARP1 with Akt and the transcriptional regulation of phosphatases like PTEN, a negative regulator of Akt signalling. PARP1 binds and inhibits Akt by poly-ADP-ribosylation at E40 and E49 residues, which impairs Akt membrane recruitment and subsequent activation.

Attenuation of neural responses to predictable sensory stimuli is thought to aid in this process of prediction error detection and model updating. The topic of whether predictive processes such as sensory attenuation can occur in minimally conscious states has been hotly debated. The current study provides a novel test for the role of awareness in prediction-based attenuation using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) prediction task, whereby predictable stimulation is known to lead to attenuated motor system excitability. The experiment tested whether motor attenuation can occur without awareness using a dual task paradigm to mask a predictive cueing relationship. Participants simultaneously completed an n-back task and a TMS-counting task; critically, a visual cue (in the n-back task) consistently predicted the occurrence of a TMS pulse (in the counting task). Instruction conditions manipulated how much participants were informed of this relationship, and awareness was assessed in a post-experimental questionnaire. The results reveal that motor attenuation was present only in participants instructed about the relationship, or in those who became aware of the cue-TMS association. Implicit, predictable cue-TMS exposure was not sufficient to elicit motor attenuation in unaware participants. These findings show that awareness of the relationship is necessary for predictive learning and prediction-based attenuation in the motor system, challenging the assumption that predictive coding operates automatically.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Constraints use integrated terms from an n-component generalization of the Lotka-Volterra (LV) predator-prey model, and from mass-based models for fisheries, non-living organics, nutrients and essential habitats.

The 16 microcosms were provided with high concentrations of the sulfur oxidation intermediate (SOI) compounds thiosulfate or tetrathionate under oxic and suboxic conditions to amplify the acid generating processes. The study identifies Halothiobacillus, Thiomonas, and Pandoraea, as the key SOB genera processing SOI. These microcosms demonstrate that protons yields resulting from thiosulfate oxidation by SOB are less than half of those predicted for thiosulfate oxidation, amongst the lowest reported for this genera. Despite adjustments for ion activity and PO42- buffering, this difference is indicative of mechanisms beyond cSOx. Further, when offered tetrathionate under oxic conditions, undescribed reactions unmatched to known sulfur enzymes were likely employed, since disproportionation is insufficient to explain observations. Meanwhile, suboxic depletion of thiosulfate, without changes in nitrate or nitrite concentrations sufficient to indicate their use as TEA requires further investigation.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Most conventional photo-curing hydrogel systems rely upon small-molecule photoinitiators which, upon activation by (ultra)violet irradiation, generate free radicals to initiate polymerization. Such an approach can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage, significantly limiting their use in sensitive biological applications. Here, we present a photoinitiator-free, gelatin-based hydrogel system functionalized with acrylamidylpyrene groups (Gel-Pyr), which undergoes photocrosslinking via a visible-light-induced [2+2] cycloaddition reaction. Gel-Pyr exhibits rapid gelation kinetics, tuneable mechanical properties, facile temporal control over photocrosslinking, and long-term structural stability (>30 days) in cell culture conditions. Rheological analyses reveal pronounced shear-thinning behaviour at room temperature, enabling extrusion-based 3D bioprinting of multilayered constructs with high structural fidelity. Fine strand resolution (<400 um) is achieved in bioprinted crosshatch structures, enabling sufficient nutrient diffusion for cell support. Furthermore, encapsulation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) within both bulk and printed constructs maintains >80% viability over 7 days, demonstrating robust cytocompatibility. By eliminating UV exposure and free radicals, this visible-light-responsive hydrogel platform offers a gentle, effective, and cytoprotective alternative to traditional systems. The combination of biocompatibility, mechanical tuneability, and printability positions Gel-Pyr as a versatile platform for tissue engineering, and advanced in vitro tissue models.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

While human and cadaver studies have characterized these deformations, preclinical device testing requires large-animal models that replicate human arterial anatomy and biomechanics. Swine are commonly used, yet their biomechanical comparability to humans remains poorly defined. Methods: We performed a detailed morphometric and biomechanical analysis of the external iliac (EIA), superficial femoral (SFA), and popliteal (PA) arteries in 20 Yucatan and 16 domestic swine using computed tomography angiography. Arteries were evaluated in straight and flexed limb postures to assess diameters, lengths, axial compression, tortuosity, bending angles, and inscribed sphere radii. Breed-specific effects of age and weight were also analyzed. Results: Porcine arterial dimensions closely matched human lower extremity vessels. EIA diameters (4.9-7.2 mm) corresponded to human SFA, porcine SFA (4.1-5.9 mm) approximated human PA, and porcine PA (3.0-4.7 mm) resembled human tibial arteries. Segment lengths supported use of multiple devices. Flexion induced 12-33% axial compression, mimicking worst-case human scenarios. Tortuosity increased distally, and bending characteristics in porcine PAs aligned with human data. In Yucatan swine, vessel diameters were stable with age and weight, while domestic swine exhibited greater variability. Flexion-induced compression and tortuosity were not influenced by age or weight. Conclusion: Swine are well-suited for modeling the geometry and biomechanics of human lower extremity arteries. Their anatomical compatibility and ability to replicate physiologic deformations make them valuable models for preclinical testing of PAD therapies and vascular devices.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Soil sulfur (S) has declined over the last decades and although it is crucial for coping with abiotic stresses, its role in grassland responses to heatwaves remains poorly documented. We aimed to determine how S nutrition modulates the responses of grasslands to heatwaves. Four monocultures and two mixtures were grown under two S levels and exposed to four thermoprotocols: i) control, ii) two successive mild heatwaves, iii) one severe heatwave, and iv) a recurrent sequence combining mild and severe heatwaves. We measured biomasses, leaf S compounds, {delta}13C as a proxy of water-use efficiency, leaf temperature, and photosystem II efficiency. S nutrition interacted with thermoprotocols. Under a severe heatwave, standard S promoted higher shoot production and better water-use efficiency. In contrast, under recurrent events, S limitation enhanced root:shoot ratio, water-use efficiency, shoot growth, and led to lower leaf temperature. S-containing metabolites did not vary with heatwaves, suggesting no direct metabolic.

Here, we show that spontaneous human brain activity during rest is structured by a deformable attractor manifold. Using large-scale fMRI datasets and a latent dynamical model, we find that cortical activity occupies two reproducible regimes: a low-coherence state with a unimodal latent distribution and a high-coherence state that exhibits bimodality, consistent with transient bistability across association networks. A compact two-parameter energy landscape explains these dynamics, revealing that transitions arise not from switching between discrete states, but from continuous deformation of the manifold that reshapes attractor geometry. Excursions into the bistable regime occur as rapid \"jumps\", whereas returns follow slow drifts along the manifold, reflecting network-specific timescales. Individuals with greater expression of the bistable regime show higher cognitive fluidity, and manifold parameters differentiate mild cognitive impairment from matched controls. These findings identify an organizing geometric and dynamical principle of resting activity, linking large-scale cortical coordination, cognitive variability, and vulnerability to pathology.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we performed comprehensive behavioral, electrophysiological, histological and molecular analyses to characterize the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse, which combines systemic heterozygosity for the common K562E mutation together with Schwann cell (SC)-specific deletion of wild-type Dnm2. This model faithfully reproduces key clinical and pathological features of DNM2-CMT, including motor deficits, reduced general force and coordination, and severe sensory and motor conduction deficits associated with axonal loss, demyelination, and inflammation. Mechanistically, we delineate a coherent pathological sequence that explains the profound functional deficits. In particular, a downregulation of the transcription factor EGR2, a master regulator of myelin gene expression, and of the myelin protein MPZ correlates with demyelination. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of DNM2 supplementation, post-symptomatic intrathecal delivery of AAV9-DNM2 driven by the Schwann cell-specific MPZ promoter was performed at 4 weeks. Although DNM2 expression increased in peripheral nerves (~1.9-fold), no significant improvements were observed across behavioural, electrophysiological, structural, or molecular parameters. Together, these findings establish the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse as a robust preclinical model, recapitulating key features of DNM2-CMT, and provides crucial insight into the biological and temporal constraints that must guide future therapeutic strategies for DNM2-CMT.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

The mammalian hippocampus, a key brain region for learning and memory, is highly vulnerable to damage in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, yet the role of cellular senescence in hippocampal aging remains underexplored. Here, we report an early onset of senescence signatures in hippocampal astrocytes of the accelerated aging and frailty mouse model SAMP8. We examine how astrocyte senescence affects excitatory synapse formation, focusing on soluble signals released by astrocytes. Astrocytes isolated from SAMP8 brain and those differentiated from SAMP8 neural stem cells show senescence hallmarks (SA-{beta}-gal, p16INK4a, Lamin B1 loss), alongside a significant reduction in synaptogenic function. While astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from control mice promotes excitatory synaptogenesis through thrombospondin-1 / 2{delta}-1 neuronal receptor signalling, ACM from senescent SAMP8 astrocytes lacks this capacity. Supplementing senescent ACM with thrombospondin-1 protein, or overexpressing thrombospondin-1 gene in senescent astrocytes, reinstates synaptogenesis. At the hippocampal level, thrombospondin-1 and synaptic puncta are reduced in SAMP8 mice. Our findings reveal that senescent astrocytes exhibit reduced synaptogenic capacity due to thrombospondin-1 loss, highlighting their contribution to synaptic dysfunction during aging. Preventing senescence in hippocampal astrocytes may thus restore astrocyte-mediated synaptogenesis in the aged brain.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Electrophysiological evidence implicates projections from the PFC to mediodorsal thalamus (PFC-MdT) as being uniquely impacted by adolescent intermittent alcohol consumption in mice. The present study aims to evaluate if voluntary consumption of alcohol during adolescence impacts anxiety or PFC-associated spatial and recognition memory and if they are associated with morphological changes to the PFC-MdT circuit. Our results indicate that compared to water-only controls, male and female mice that voluntarily consumed alcohol during adolescence demonstrate performance deficits in the object-in-place recognition task, without affecting the novel object recognition task, Y-maze alternation, anxiety or locomotion, an outcome consistent with PFC and MdT dysfunction. Morphological assessment of PFC neurons from male and female mice following behavioral tasks found a reduction in spine density in basal and apical, but not oblique dendrites of PFC-MdT neurons.

Salivary allergen-specific secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is a useful marker to objectively evaluate treatment effectiveness. However, saliva samples usually exhibit high background noise because of nonspecific binding in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Objective: We aimed to establish an amplified ELISA to measure allergen-specific salivary SIgA levels to assess the efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). Methods: Biotinyl tyramide (BT-Tyr) was used to amplify the signal in a colorimetric ELISA. The allergen sugi basic protein (SBP) was biotinylated and used as a reporter to obtain sensitive and specific results with low background. This ELISA was used to measure anti-SBP SIgA levels in saliva samples from SLIT-treated patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis. Results: The ELISA was highly sensitive and achieved more than 200-fold signal amplification compared to non-amplified conditions. It was also specific for antigens without background noise. The levels of SBP-specific SIgA in saliva increased in patients 3 months after SLIT initiation. Conclusion: We established a sensitive colorimetric ELISA to measure SBP-specific SIgA in saliva using BT-Tyr-based amplification and biotinylated antigen as a reporter.

Prior to birth, development of the hematopoietic system constitutes a period of broad differentiation potential, with certain immune cells arising exclusively during ontogeny. While age is known to affect lineage bias, the underlying molecular differences driving lineage preference in fetal and adult human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) remain unclear. Through single-cell cultures of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we observed that fetal cells frequently generate mixed-lineage colonies, whereas adult HSCs are largely restricted to myeloid output. To investigate how these lineage preferences were encoded at the chromatin level, we performed single-cell ATAC-sequencing on first-trimester HSPCs. While adult HSCs showed enrichment of lineage-specific transcription factor motifs, fetal cells lacked such enrichment, consistent with their broader differentiation potential. We additionally uncovered a developmental-specific plasticity in fetal lymphoid progenitors, manifested as a hybrid lympho-myeloid chromatin program not present in adult progenitors. Additionally, the motif for PAX5, master regulator of B cell development, showed markedly reduced accessibility in fetal cells, indicating a more plastic and less committed lymphoid state.

As coral biology is often studied in the context of global change and changing temperatures, knowledge gaps persist in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways involved in the responses to other factors than temperature, such as light intensity, which decreases exponentially in the water column and gradually changes the environment. To fill this gap, we tested the response of the Hawaiian rice coral Montipora capitata to decreased light intensity in a field experiment in Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i, using Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) proteomics. There was a significant effect of light intensity on both the coral and zooxanthellae proteomes. In the M. capitata host, 69 proteins differed significantly in abundance between light levels after two years. The 50 proteins identified as significantly more abundant in the control condition were mostly involved in mRNA and RNA processing, pointing toward a positive correlation between metabolic activity, growth rates and increased light levels. The 19 proteins identified as significantly more abundant in the shade treatment were associated with calcium transport and with the structure of key cellular components, such as cell membrane and cytoskeleton. By contrast, zooxanthellae showed only minor changes in protein abundances, with photosynthesis proteins more abundant in the shade treatment and enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism more abundant in the control treatment. Overall, these findings establish a baseline for our understanding of the cellular and metabolic processes driving Montipora capitata's acclimatization potential to different light intensities.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

These models use all available information on animals phenotypes, genotypes, and pedigrees, yet missing parental information in pedigrees remains a challenge that affects genomic breeding value (GEBV) predictions. Therefore, the choice of method for handling missing parents can affect the prediction of breeding values. Here, we compared three approaches to model missing parental information for three levels of missing pedigree data: P_Real - pedigree from routine evaluation, P_2010 - at least 20 percent of dams and 10 percent of sires born before 2019 were set to missing, and P_4020 - at least 40 percent of dams and 20 percent of sires born before 2019 were set to missing. Missing parents information was expressed through missing codes in the raw pedigree (RP) by defining genetic groups (GG) that represent missing parents grouped based on year of birth, sex, and country of origin, or by defining metafounders (MF), which represent missing parents grouped by average genetic relationships estimated from the genomic information of their descendants. The genomic breeding values for fat yield were estimated using the single-step test-day SNP-BLUP model implemented with MiXBLUP software. For the considered scenarios, the results were presented separately for sires and dams, as well as for genotyped and ungenotyped individuals. We observed differences in the prediction quality between genotyped and ungenotyped animals. While GEBV predictions for the former were generally stable across scenarios, the predictions for the ungenotyped individuals varied. In particular, the removal of parental information led to less stable results when missing parental information was expressed by MF, where insufficient pedigree completeness resulted in an overestimation of the genetic trend. In conclusion, for informative pedigrees with a small percentage of missing parents, the incorporation of GG and MF results in very similar GEBV predictions, however GG appear to be a more robust approach for ungenotyped individuals in highly incomplete pedigrees.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a technique that images individual biomolecules frozen in a thin layer of amorphous ice, has emerged as a leading method for determining the structure of biomolecules at atomic resolution. Recent advances in cryo-EM reconstruction have made significant progress in determining structure in heterogeneous conformational landscapes. In contrast to reconstruction, a different class of techniques has been used to infer population weights, referred to as ensemble reweighting. These methods have yet to be generalized to infer structural heterogeneity simultaneously. Here, we present a method for cryo-EM ensemble optimization that directly infers the optimal set of structures and their associated population weights from cryo-EM images using Bayesian optimization techniques. Our method iterates between optimizing the structures and weights using a likelihood defined in terms of cryo-EM particle images (not reconstructions) and projecting onto the domain of a physical prior through an approach inspired by projected gradient descent. We test the method on several systems, ranging from a four-atom toy model to a large protein system with real cryo-EM data.

In this study, we show that the miR-379/656 cluster (C14MC) acts as a tumor suppressor cluster and is epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. We demonstrated that C14MC is downregulated in HCC cell lines through nCounter assay and in clinical samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) liver hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. The C14MC promoter was identified and characterized through cloning and dual luciferase assay. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the loss of C14MC tumor suppressor function is directly regulated by the hypermethylation of promoter-bound CpGs, as shown in artificial methylation experiments. The reactivation of specific C14MC miRNAs, like miR-299-5p and miR-376c-3p via mimics, abrogated the expression of several target oncogenes, including PARP1, SPP1, RAD21, and CENPA that regulate critical molecular pathways such as the p53 signaling and NF-kappa B signaling pathways in HCC. Additionally, overexpression of miR-299-5p and miR-376c-3p inhibited HCC cell migration and invasion, suggesting that overexpression of candidate C14MC miRNAs can mitigate cancer hallmarks in HCC cells. Furthermore, we checked for the clinical correlation of C14MC targets and their target genes in terms of survival outcomes and identified the key genes associated with prognostic potential in HCC.

Resolving consistent, generalizable molecular patterns across diverse wheat genotypes within a large-scale, heterogeneous field study remains technically and methodologically challenging. Addressing this gap, we integrated quantitative mycotoxin profiling with untargeted metabolomics in a field experiment comprising 105 wheat genotypes deliberately inoculated with F. culmorum, with the goal of identifying molecular signatures of infection and containment under realistic agronomic conditions. Quantified deoxynivalenol (DON) concentrations provided a robust, continuous measure of infection intensity, enabling metabolite profiles to be related directly to pathogen activity beyond the limitations of symptom-based visual scoring. Consistent with established Fusarium trichothecene biosynthesis, sesquiterpene-derived metabolites closely tracked toxin accumulation, thereby recapitulating infection-associated metabolic patterns across the large-scale field study. Conversely, glycosylated diterpene conjugates were elevated under low toxin accumulation, linking their abundance to contained Fusarium pathogen activity and highlighting a largely underexplored aspect of wheat metabolism in host-pathogen interactions. Elucidating their biosynthetic origin, enzymatic interconversion, and regulatory context will be key to defining potential diterpene-associated defense processes across wheat genotypes.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Despite their potential importance, rBMAds have remained poorly characterized due to their scarcity in rodents. Here, we used a high-yield method to isolate human rBMAds, enabling structural, proteomic, lipidomic, and functional analyses.

Using substrate-induced EMT in ex vivo explants, we demonstrate that EMT initiation upregulates SMAD1 expression, priming cells for BMP signalling competence across germ layers. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals SNAI2 and SMAD1 co-expression in EMT initiation regions, and SNAI2 overexpression is sufficient to induce ectopic SMAD1 expression in vivo. While BMP signalling is dispensable for EMT initiation, it regulates cell fate proportions, dispersal dynamics, precursor region depletion rates, and migration directionality. This coupling provides a mechanism for synchronising cell fate specification with invasion progression during axis elongation, positioning EMT as a process that actively modulates morphogen competence to coordinate tissue-level cell behaviours during collective cell invasion.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Moreover, detecting structural variations (SVs [&ge;] 50 nucleotides long) remains challenging using only standard approaches of either short or long-read sequence approaches against a linear reference genome. Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies and graph-based assembly now enable the construction of breed-specific pangenomes, revealing previously uncharacterized genomic regions that may contribute to important agricultural traits. In this study we constructed a cattle pangenome graph using 16 high-quality haplotype-resolved genome assemblies originating from nine breeds representing the diversity of French cattle populations, and including Yak (Bos grunniens) as a close outgroup species. Using a trio-based strategy combined with complementary sequencing technologies and bioinformatics methods, we identified and characterized 101,219 structural variations. Of these, 33,634 were classified as non-reference unique insertions (NRUIs), adding several megabases of novel genomic sequences absent from the current Hereford reference genome. Analysis of the distribution of these NRUIs revealed significant genome-wide enrichment within QTL regions associated with milk production and morphological traits, suggesting their contribution to the genetic basis of economically relevant phenotypes. Furthermore, their functional annotation highlighted two NRUIs located within the intronic regions of ARMH3 and EPHA5, both specific to the Normande breed and significantly associated with milk production and morphological traits, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the value of pangenome approaches to uncover functionally relevant SVs, particularly NRUIs, that are systematically not in the current reference genome.

S. R.; Nischan, N.; Silva, A.; Kohler, J. J.", "abstract": "Pertussis toxin (whooping cough) is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Among the virulence factors produced by B. pertussis, pertussis toxin (PT) is responsible for key disease symptoms, including impacts on the immune system. PT is an AB5 toxin, consisting of a single catalytic A subunit and five B subunits. The B pentamer recognizes cell surface glycans and facilitates intracellular delivery of the catalytic A subunit. PT also impacts host cell signaling via mechanisms that do not depend on the catalytic activity of the A subunit. In particular, PT promotes signaling through the T-cell receptor (TCR), leading to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades. PT prefers to bind sialylated and N-linked glycans, but other aspects of PT's glycan binding specificity remain underexplored. Here we report that the absence of fucose on mammalian cell surfaces leads to increased binding by PT. Using pharmacological inhibitors in a human bronchial epithelial cell line, we observe that sialylation and N-linked glycosylation promote PT binding while fucosylation interferes with PT binding. Similarly, CHO and Colo205 cells deficient in fucosylation exhibited enhanced PT binding as compared to the corresponding wild-type cell lines. Genetic knockout of FUT3/FUT5/FUT6 or of FUT8 led to increased PT binding, suggesting that specific fucosylated epitopes mediate protection from PT. The functional impact of altered PT binding was examined in Jurkat T cells, where removal of cell surface non-core fucose led to increased PT-dependent ERK phosphorylation. In sum, our study indentifies a role for fucosylation in protecting mammalian cells from PT.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Ensuring their structural integrity under stress and maintaining batch consistency require robust quality control. Methyl 2D NMR has emerged as a powerful tool to probe mAb structure at natural isotopic abundance, enabling spectral fingerprint comparisons across production batches to detect subtle structural changes. However, extracting atomic-level structural information requires assignment of methyl resonances to their amino acids. While such assignments are available for several antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), no comprehensive assignment has been reported for the crystallisable fragment (Fc). In this study, we present the methyl group assignment of the 50-kDa Fc fragment of an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody. Using cell-free expression, strategic isotopic labelling, and high-quality 2D and 3D NMR experiments, we successfully assigned 94% of methyl resonances of a non-glycosylated Fc. Given that therapeutic mAbs are typically produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, we transferred this assignment to the methyl spectrum of a glycosylated Fc fragment obtained by the enzymatic cleavage of a CHO-produced mAb at natural abundance, achieving 83% assignment coverage. This assignment was then used to investigate the impact of methionine oxidation on Fc structure at atomic resolution using NMR. The methyl group assignment transforms 2D methyl NMR fingerprinting into a powerful tool for quality control. It enables the direct comparison of spectra acquired on mAbs produced at natural abundance, allowing the detection and localisation of chemical modifications and structural changes without the need for isotopic labelling.

Here, we employed an integrated strategy combining network pharmacology, protein-protein interaction analysis, Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment, molecular docking, and 100-ns molecular dynamics simulations to comprehensively elucidate the multi-target and multi pathway regulatory mechanisms of Aloe vera active constituents against NSCLC. We identified 369 aloe-derived targets and 5519 NSCLC-related genes, with 268 overlapping targets enriched in pathways involving EGFR signalling, PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, p53 regulation, inflammation, apoptosis, and drug-resistance networks.

Notably, the intermediate state, which is unstable in a fixed-chemical-potential system, can be stabilized in confinement below a critical width. Intriguingly, in wider systems, the intermediate solution becomes unstable due to a negative relationship between the chemical potential and the particle number, resulting in partial-wetting or prewetting droplets. Importantly, starting from a homogeneous surface, droplets can form only when the average volume fraction reaches the threshold of the intermediate state. Our theory elucidates the kinetic pathways of droplet formation in a confined system, providing crucial insights into how biomolecular condensates near surfaces respond to cellular events, such as the synthesis of biomolecules.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

More routine biophysical methods with broader applicability to varied samples is desirable to support the rapidly expanding targeted protein degradation field. The majority of PROTACs in development and in the clinic act through a Cullin RING E3 ligase (CRL) of which the pentameric von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Cullin 2 RING E3 complex CRL2VHL is the foundational example. Native mass spectrometry (nMS) can be used to characterise protein complexes but has not previously been used to characterise a full E3 or any E3-E2 interactions.

Here, we uncover and characterize a novel mechanism in Drosophila by which the midgut is able to generate strong muscular whip-like contractions. This pacemaker activity, here named superstalsis, is only active at certain physiological conditions and is selectively linked to longitudinal visceral muscle activation.

The improved map allowed us to extend the structure beyond the MX -helix and prior to the MA -helix of the intracellular domain. The new structure defines a sharp N-terminal boundary of each MA -helix to place agrin-dependent phosphorylated tyrosines unambiguously within the flexible regions of the MX-MA loops. Two distinct conformations of the {delta} M4 -helix were also resolved, indicating that M4 conformational heterogeneity reflects intrinsic flexibility rather than a change in gating state. The new structural constraints defined for the MX-MA loop were then used to evaluate AlphaFold3-predicted full-length models of the nAChR, rapsyn, and various rapsyn-nAChR complexes, identifying a consistent, asymmetric 3:1 binding architecture where each rapsyn is always sandwiched between the MX-MA loops from two subunits and where each phospho-tyrosine is lodged in a cationic pocket formed by conserved residues implicated in congenital myasthenic syndromes.

Acute ethanol consumption has a profound impact on animal physiology, but whether intoxication affects the role of sleep in memory consolidation remains unexplored. We demonstrate that acute ethanol exerts a paradoxical dual impact on sleep-memory coupling in Drosophila. Typically, satiated flies require sleep for memory consolidation, but starved flies that must forage for food switch to sleep-independent memory. Ethanol selectively impairs memory consolidation in satiated flies, whereas memories in starved flies remain intact despite intoxication. The observed impairment in satiated flies is due to a switch to sleep-independent memory, which then can't be supported because of ethanol-induced sedation. Mechanistically, the ethanol-induced switch to sleep-independent memory is driven by neuropeptide F-mediated modulation of dopamine signaling. These findings reveal that ethanol intoxication inverts the canonical function of sleep, wherein it becomes detrimental to memory consolidation.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined how post-developmental re-expression of the synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein SynGAP1 affects network structure and signaling dynamics in a conditional SynGAP1 haploinsufficient mouse. Quantitative multiplex co-immunoprecipitation (QMI) across development revealed that SynGAP haploinsufficiency selectively reduced SynGAP-containing complexes without broadly disrupting NMDA-dependent network responses. Tamoxifen-inducible re-expression of SynGAP at postnatal day 21 fully restored both steady-state and activity-dependent interactions within the SynGAP module in hippocampus, and additionally normalized secondary alterations in Shank-Homer scaffolding complexes in somatosensory cortex. These data demonstrate that biochemical restoration of a disrupted synaptic network is achievable, even after early developmental windows have closed.

Studies in zebrafish have identified a remarkable morphological left-right asymmetry in the dorsal habenula (zebrafish equivalent of mammalian MHb) to interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) pathway and its left-sided-specific role in modulating fear responses. However, there is little evidence for structural or functional lateralization in the mammalian MHb-IPN pathway. Here, we investigated the synaptic properties of left- and right-MHb afferents to the IPN and their roles in the expression of conditioned fear in mice. We found that each IPN neuron receives inputs from both left and right MHb, but the left MHb-originating synapses exhibit lower release probability and higher {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR)-mediated potentiation compared to the right MHb-originating synapses. Interestingly, these asymmetrical properties persist in the inversus visceral mutant mice with normal laterality of the internal organs (situs solitus), but nearly disappear in those with reversed internal organ laterality (situs inversus). Behaviorally, chemogenetic inhibition of cholinergic neurons and conditional deletion of GABABR in the left, but not the right, MHb significantly attenuated cue-dependent fear recall. Our results demonstrate functional asymmetry of the MHb under partial influence of the nodal flow in mice, revealing a predominant role of GABABR-mediated signaling in the left MHb-IPN pathway in modulating fear memories. These findings suggest that lateralized MHb pathways could represent a fundamental principle in the neural regulation of emotion across species, but that they develop differently in zebrafish and mice.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

The fungal root endophyte Serendipita indica (Si) is known to promote plant growth and confer broad stress tolerance. To assess how natural host genetic variation influences Si-mediated protection, we screened 47 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions for susceptibility to the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana (Bs) with and without Si colonization. All accessions benefited from Si, indicating that endophyte-mediated disease mitigation occurs broadly across diverse host genotypes. A focused comparison of two genetically and geographically proximate Swedish accessions, T510 and T530, which displayed the most divergent protection scores, revealed substantial differences in Bs susceptibility. Transcriptome profiling under bi- and tripartite colonization showed conserved defense responses in both accessions. Bs infection downregulated growth- and development-related genes, consistent with a growth-immunity trade-off, with T530 exhibiting higher Bs colonization and a stronger transcriptional response than T510. Co-colonization with Si effectively suppressed pathogen growth and disease symptoms in both accessions. Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses identified four immune receptor genes, including the TIR-NLR ISI, present in T510 but absent in T530. An isi T-DNA insertion mutant phenocopied the heightened Bs susceptibility of T530, confirming that ISI contributes to root immunity, while Si-mediated protection remained intact despite increased pathogen susceptibility. Together, these findings demonstrate that fungal endophytes can mitigate the functional consequences of natural immune variation and enhance the resilience of genetically diverse plant populations.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

A.; Hernaez, M.; Kandimalla, K. K.; Kalari, K. R.", "abstract": "Background: Neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction is being recognized as one of the earliest contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, systematic investigation of NVU dysfunction is currently limited by lack of access to molecular level information due to underrepresentation of vascular and mural cells in standard single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets. Consequently, existing transcriptomic atlases lack the resolution necessary to capture the coordinated intercellular signaling and dysfunction across vascular components of NVU, including endothelial cells and pericytes. Methods: We constructed the Human NVU Atlas by integrating 11 publicly available snRNA-seq datasets, including vascular-enriched samples, from the human prefrontal cortex. This comprehensive dataset aggregates over 4.2 million nuclei from 748 donors, including AD patients and age-matched controls. We utilized a unified probabilistic pipeline based on deep generative models (SCVI) to perform batch-aware integration and employed an ensemble of supervised and deep-learning classifiers to rigorously re-annotate cell types. Differential expression and ligand-receptor interaction analyses were subsequently performed to identify cell-type-specific disruptions in males versus females. Results: The atlas successfully curated vascular populations from 11 studies to assemble the largest publicly available NVU cohort of endothelial cells (2.8%) and pericytes (1.9%) alongside astrocytes and neurons. Differential expression analysis revealed that while neurons predominantly exhibited gene downregulation in AD, vascular cells displayed a pattern of transcriptional hyperactivity with significant gene upregulation. We also identified pronounced sex-specific vulnerabilities; females exhibited distinct inflammatory signatures and downregulation of basement membrane collagen genes (e.g., COL4A1, COL4A2) in pericytes, whereas these changes were not observed in males. Moreover, cell-cell interaction analysis revealed a widespread loss of collagen-integrin signaling between pericytes and neurons, suggesting the involvement of extracellular matrix disruptions in NVU dysfunction observed in AD. Conclusion: The Human NVU Atlas provides a high-resolution, integrated transcriptomic framework for dissecting the cellular heterogeneity of the neurovascular unit. By uncovering sex-specific vascular mechanisms and disrupted intercellular communication, this resource highlights the critical role of vascular cells in AD progression and serves as a foundational reference for investigating cerebrovascular contribution to AD.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Characterization of in vivo transcriptional landscapes and in vitro RNA polymerase-promoter interactions showed the -10 element as essential for promoter evolution from random sequences. In contrast, the -35 element, though broadly conserved, is dispensable for promoter birth. Instead, it exerts greater impact on gene regulation via coordinated interactions with transcription activators and RNA polymerase. We further showed that evolution fine-tunes the -35 and -10 sequences of transcription factor-regulated promoters to achieve near-maximal fold changes by lowering basal while elevating induced expression. A notable exception is PluxI, whose leaky expression provides a crucial baseline for initiating quorum sensing.

Environmental genotoxins such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a widespread polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and its reactive metabolite benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) form bulky DNA adducts that interfere with replication and transcription, thereby posing significant risks to embryonic genome stability. To examine how genetic defects in DNA repair influence these effects, we assessed human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying pathogenic mutations in ERCC6 (encoding the Cockayne syndrome B, CSB, protein), a key component of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Pathogenic ERCC6 mutations result in Cockayne syndrome- a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by growth failure, premature aging, and multisystemic degeneration, thus underscoring the essential developmental functions of CSB. Exposure of healthy and CSB-deficient patient derived iPSCs to BPDE revealed impaired proliferation, persistent accumulation of DNA damage and defective checkpoint activation in CSB-deficient lines. Although the levels of key pluripotency-regulating proteins such as OCT4 and NANOG remained unaltered, we observed altered levels of SOX2 and p-SMAD1/5 signaling thus implying that unrepaired DNA damage can perturb developmental-associated signaling pathways and biological processes. Transcriptomic profiling revealed broad suppression of DNA repair and cell-cycle pathways together with activation of p53-, TNF-, and MAPK/JNK-mediated stress responses in CSB-deficient lines. Failure to induce anti-oxidant defenses, including SOD2 and IDO, further contributed to oxidative imbalance and incomplete apoptotic clearance. These findings demonstrate that CSB function is essential for coupling DNA repair with transcriptional recovery and redox homeostasis in pluripotent cells. Loss of CSB destabilizes the genome stability under genotoxic stress, providing a mechanistic basis for developmental toxicity of environmental polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and underscoring the importance of considering genetic susceptibility in developmental toxicology risk assessment.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Genomic studies on Borrelia are hindered by the difficulty of culturing procedures: standard protocols require extended incubation, substantial technical expertise, and are prone to failure, limiting timely recovery of isolates. This contributes to a low number of complete Borrelia genomes available in public repositories, particularly for species other than B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Here we introduce a novel approach that overcomes the necessity for extended culture by utilizing Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) directly on freshly collected ticks, and that can be performed in parallel to classical culturing. The protocol is paired with a tailored bioinformatic pipeline designed to ensure accurate assembly and reliable downstream analyses. Benchmarking on multiple control isolates demonstrated that the method yields high-quality chromosomal assemblies. To demonstrate practical applicability, we applied the protocol to freshly collected ticks, successfully generating five high-quality Borrelia chromosomes (two B. lusitaniae, two B. afzelii and one B. garinii). By generating sequencing-ready DNA in five days rather than months, our protocol greatly streamlines the process and minimizes the effort associated with traditional culture-based methods. This workflow will facilitate broader representation of understudied Borrelia species and support future epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary investigations on this pathogen.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "TIF1{gamma} is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and key mediator of the noncanonical TGF-{beta} signaling pathway. Initially characterized for its developmental functions, TIF1{gamma} is essential for maintaining the pluripotency of adult stem cells, including long-term hematopoietic stem cells. Although TGF-{beta} signaling contributes to cancer progression and recurrence, TIF1{gamma} has traditionally been regarded as a tumor suppressor due to its inhibition of oncogenes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, clinical reports have associated high TIF1{gamma} expression at advanced cancer stages with poor prognosis. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this paradox, we identify a previously unrecognized role of TIF1{gamma} in promoting the self-renewal capacity of oral cancer cells, thereby contributing to disease recurrence. Phosphoproteomic profiling of self-renewal-enriched cells revealed activation of a noncanonical TGF-{beta} pathway. Using extreme limiting dilution assays, an ALDH1A1-DsRed2 cancer stem cell reporter, multiple oral cancer cell lines, primary 3D cultures on alginate matrix, and orthotopic mouse models, we demonstrate that TIF1{gamma} depletion significantly reduces self-renewal and prolongs disease-free survival. Immunoprecipitation (IP)-LC/MS/MS analysis identified transcriptional regulators within the TIF1{gamma} interactome, including TRRAP and H2A.Z, which were validated by IP and FRET assays. ChIP and IP studies further revealed that during self-renewal enrichment, TRRAP acetylates H2A.Z, decreasing the chromatin occupancy of its unacetylated form. Acetylated H2A.Z is subsequently recognized by TIF1{gamma}, which monoubiquitinates H2B at promoters of self-renewal genes such as HES1, initiating transcription. In alignment with findings from mouse neocortical development, where a Notch-independent Hes1-expressing (NIHes1) population defines primitive quiescent stem cells, we show that TIF1{gamma} acts as an acetylation reader specifically at the NIHES1 promoter region of HES1. TIF1{gamma} depletion drives NIHES1 cells toward a Notch-dependent HES1 (NDHES1) identity. RNA-seq confirmed reversal of 100 NIHES1-specific genes following TIF1{gamma} loss, along with downregulation of pluripotency-associated genes found in embryonic stem cells, supporting a critical role for TIF1{gamma} in maintaining primitive cancer stem cell states. Consistent with our in vivo findings, primary oral cancer samples showed that increased frequencies of TIF1{gamma}+/TRRAP+/H2A.Z- cells strongly predict recurrence. Given that the histone acetylation-reader function of TIF1{gamma} drives poor prognosis, our findings suggest the TIF1{gamma} bromodomain as a potential therapeutic target requiring further investigation.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

While chronic energy surplus is a well-established driver of weight gain and obesity, the mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) expansion to cardiometabolic complications remain incompletely understood. In obese individuals, dysfunctional AT loses its capacity to store excess lipids, leading to ectopic fat accumulation and contributing to cardiometabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular events that drive the transition from healthy to dysfunctional adipocytes are poorly defined. At the opposite end of the adiposity spectrum, lipodystrophies represent a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by selective loss of AT, often accompanied by severe metabolic disturbances. Despite these contrasting adipose phenotypes, both obesity and lipodystrophy result in similar metabolic complications. In this study, we investigated whether AT in these two contrasting conditions shares a common molecular signature. We performed an unbiased comparative transcriptomic analysis of AT from lipodystrophic BSCL2-deficient and obese mice, identifying a shared signature of 129 genes. Using publicly available datasets, we replicated this signature and refined it to 102 genes whose expression is consistently altered in both obese and lipodystrophic adipose tissue. Correlation network analysis, gene ontology, and literature-based refinement revealed that these genes fall into nine functional categories: lipogenesis, adipocyte differentiation, carbohydrate metabolism, mitochondrial function, amino acid metabolism, reactive oxygen species, metabolic processes, immune response, and a group with no clear functional association. Most of these genes expression levels correlated strongly with insulin sensitivity across lipodystrophic and obese mice, as well as human samples. Finally, 52 genetic loci containing these genes harbor variants associated with type 2 diabetes, including 11 loci where genetic associations directly influence candidate gene expression levels.In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that a shared energetic collapse of adipocytes, characterized by profound metabolic inflexibility in pathways spanning glucose utilization, lipogenesis, and amino acid catabolism, represents a common pathogenic mechanism underlying adipose tissue dysfunction in both obesity and lipodystrophy. This convergent molecular signature underscores the critical role of intrinsic adipocyte metabolic health in systemic energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

To investigate this further, we designed four different versions of a rat Go/No-go task, where we systematically manipulated response requirements, temporal task demands, and controllability of reward pursuit. Dopamine release increased reliably during action initiation (Go) but was delayed during action suppression (No-go), and was insensitive to augmented response demands or controllability. Following response completion, dopamine rose gradually until animals arrived at the reward location, irrespective of reward-delivery timing, prior action demands, or controllability. This proximity dopamine-signal was exaggerated after animals exhibited Pavlovian consummatory behavior during No-go trials, revealing a motivational signal component. Together, these findings indicate that in reward contexts, VMS-dopamine signals successively integrate the invigoration of action initiation with the continuous estimation of spatial - but not temporal - proximity to rewards.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Sir2, Sir3 and Sir4 are indispensable for silencing, whereas Sir1 has a more limited role. The Sir proteins are also involved in repression at telomeres and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats. Proposed mechanisms for Sir-mediated silencing include limiting access to silenced DNA and inhibition of transcript initiation and/or elongation. Using an inducible M.SssI DNA methyltransferase expression system, we showed previously that the silenced mating type loci are methylated at a much slower rate than the rest of the genome in vivo. Here, we show that, in the absence of Sir2, Sir3 or Sir4, the silenced loci and the telomeric X elements are methylated at a similar rate to the rest of the genome, indicating that these Sir proteins impede access, but do not prevent it. The rDNA repeats are methylated faster in the absence of Sir2 and, to a lesser extent, of Sir3, but not of Sir4. The methylation rates of adjacent rDNA repeats are not strongly correlated in wild-type cells, suggesting that Sir proteins silence rDNA repeats randomly. Loss of Sir1 increases the methylation rate at HMRa but not at HML, telomeres or rDNA. Our data indicate that steric occlusion is unlikely to be the primary mechanism of silencing, since silenced DNA is accessible in vivo, albeit at a slower rate than elsewhere in the genome.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Imprinted gene expression plays crucial roles in embryonic growth and brain development. Higher-order chromatin structure has long been associated with gene regulation, particularly in the context of spatial enhancer-promoter interactions. Because imprinted genes exhibit allele-biased expression, it is compelling to ask whether differences in the three-dimensional organization of maternal and paternal genomes underlie this regulation. Using a capture Hi-C approach, we identified parental allele-specific higher-order chromatin structures across multiple imprinted domains in the mouse brain. These allele-specific structural features largely stem from annotated imprinting control regions (ICRs), concomitant with allele-specific binding of CTCF. The transcription start sites of active and inactive alleles of imprinted genes engage in distinct distal chromatin interactions that differ in number and in the epigenetic states of their contact regions. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening identified a distal cis-regulatory element that modulates imprinted expression at the Mest-Copg2 locus in neurons, with its regulatory activity closely linked to allele-specific chromatin interactions. Further investigation revealed that both a cis-acting long non-coding RNA and allele-specific enhancer-promoter architecture modulates Mest-Copg2 imprinted expression in neurons.

We investigated CD4+ T cell phenotype and function in a small cohort of individuals who recovered from mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection without hospitalization and were divided into short or prolonged symptom duration groups. Five individuals with prolonged symptom duration showed marked downregulation of CD4 on CD3+CD8- T cells (CD4low group) and a poor response to TCR stimulation with the superantigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), as shown by weak upregulation of the activation markers CD134 and CD69.

In the central nervous system, KARs predominantly exist as heterotetramers comprising low-affinity (GluK1-3) and high-affinity (GluK4-5) subunits, with GluK2/GluK5 being the most abundant. To elucidate their conformational transitions, we determined electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) structures of GluK2/GluK5 KARs in multiple functional states. The apo structure reveals compact packing with extensive intersubunit interactions between the ligand-binding domains (LBDs), beyond conserved D1-D1 contacts. Similarly, the glutamate-bound structure exhibits enhanced packing that stabilizes the desensitized conformation through increased intersubunit contacts relative to homomeric KARs, indicating that heterotetramers are conformationally less dynamic. To investigate subtype-specific inhibition, we engineered GluK2 and GluK5 mutants with altered affinities for the antagonist UBP310. Structural analysis of these mutants reveals distinct UBP310 binding modes on GluK2 versus GluK5 subunits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that targeting GluK5 is more effective than targeting GluK2; stabilizing GluK5 locks the receptor in a pore-occluded conformation, whereas 25 antagonizing GluK2 leaves considerable physical space above the pore. These findings provide a structural framework for understanding the distinct contributions of GluK2 and GluK5 subunits to KAR function and highlight new strategies for developing subunit-specific therapeutics.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

This study constructs a novel magnetically modulated photonic quantum biosensing system based on the CadC-T7 gene circuit, replacing the traditional fluorescent reporter gene EGFP with the magnetically modulated fluorescent protein MagLOV - a quantum biomaterial. To enhance its magnetic modulation performance, the mutant with the highest lock-in amplitude during the directed evolution (R10, MagLOV 2) was selected; Simultaneously, systematic parameter optimization was conducted to determine the optimal magnetic modulation frequency (0.05 Hz), the heavy metal stimulation duration (the 2-hour group exhibited the most significant intra-group variation), and the bacterial concentration at the onset of the heavy metal stimulation (controlled at OD600 = 1 to prevent fluorescence quenching due to culture turbidity). The system demonstrates excellent multi-analyte detection capabilities for lead chloride, lead nitrate, and cadmium chloride across a concentration range of 10-8 to 10-4 M. Compared to conventional steady-state photometric methods based on EGFP and MagLOV 2, the lock-in analysis of MagLOV 2 achieves detection sensitivities enhanced by 1~2 orders of magnitude, with detection limits as low as 2.4 nM for cadmium chloride, 4.8 nM for lead nitrate, and 9.9 nM for lead chloride. Langmuir isotherm fitting results demonstrate high quantitative accuracy (R2 > 0.950), with particularly outstanding fitting performance for cadmium chloride (R2 = 0.999) and lead nitrate (R2 = 0.995).", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we present an integrated biochemical approach that couples glycolysis with a synthetic microbial consortium to upcycle post-consumer PET (pcPET) into polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). Glycolysis efficiently depolymerized pcPET into bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) in 2 h, circumventing the limitations of in vivo PET degradation. We engineered a two-species microbial consortium composed of Comamonas testosteroni RW31, able to metabolise terephthalic acid, and Pseudomonas putida JM37, able to consume ethylene glycol, each modified for the extracellular secretion of PET- and MHET-hydrolases, employing different plasmid architectures. This division of labour enabled rapid BHET hydrolysis and the subsequent upcycling of the released monomers into PHAs. The combination of the different strains allowed to select C. testosteroni pSEVA354-MHETase and P. putida pSEVA234-PETase as the best consortium, based on growth and PHAs content. Overall, this work proposes a strategy for PET waste depolymerisation and valorisation, highlighting the potential of mixed chemical and biological approaches and the use of non-conventional microbial chassis within engineered consortia.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we use gnotobiotic honey bees (Apis mellifera) as a model system to systematically assess the colonization potential of a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse panel of 56 bacterial strains. This panel included native symbionts, opportunistic bee-associated taxa, gut microbes from other bee species, and non-bee environmental isolates. Bacterial load was highest for native strains and declined with increasing phylogenetic distance from native core symbionts. Competition with other bacteria reduced load across all groups, but native strains were least affected. Completeness of shared KEGG metabolic pathways correlated with load in some taxa, but metabolic capacity alone did not fully explain patterns of host filtering. A key finding was that AMP sensitivity varied widely among strains and was highest in closely related bee-associated bacteria. Notably, even highly successful colonizers such as Gilliamella and Snodgrassella were AMP-sensitive. AMP sensitivity showed a negative correlation with bacterial load, but not with the frequency of host colonization. These findings suggest that AMPs modulate symbiont abundance rather than acting as strict barriers to colonization. Overall, our results reveal that host filtering in the bee gut is multifaceted, integrating immune-mediated barriers, microbial traits, and competitive interactions.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

To successfully establish an infection, intracytosolic Gram-negative pathogens must block this host response. Indeed, Shigella OspC3 suppresses epithelial pyroptosis by targeting and inactivating Caspase-4 (CASP4). Here, we demonstrate that OspC2, which shares 96% identity with OspC3, targets Caspase-5 (CASP5), a close paralog of CASP4. Through a combination of yeast two-hybrid, transfection, and bacterial infection assays, we show that the distinct pyroptotic caspase specificities of OspC2 and OspC3 are determined by a short -helical region, designated the Pyroptotic Caspase Specificity (PCS) domain. This domain is located upstream from the Ankyrin Rich Repeat (ARR) region previously established to promote OspC3 binding to CASP4. Swapping PCS domains between OspC2 and OspC3 is sufficient to redirect their caspase targeting. Evidence for CASP5-driven pyroptosis in response to infection has not yet been established. However, CASP5 displays signatures of positive selection at residues predicted to interact with the PCS domain of OspC2. Notably, the introduction of orangutan-specific residues into human CASP5 disrupt its interaction with and modification by OspC2, demonstrating that CASP5 natural variation can cause key functional differences in this host-microbe molecular interaction. These findings highlight the evolutionary interplay between bacterial effectors and host proteins, support a likely role for CASP5 in responding to Gram-negative bacteria, and identify promising therapeutic targets for enhancing epithelial defense against bacterial pathogens.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Unlike most of the fungal kingdom, this species exhibits a growth optimum at 45{degrees}C and is intolerant of temperatures below 30{degrees}C. To dissect the mechanisms of thermophilicity in this system, we implemented a large-scale insertional mutagenesis approach. We first made thousands of T. thermophilus mutants and cultured them at different temperature extremes in standard medium. Phenotyping-by-sequencing identified dozens of disrupted loci that represented candidate determinants of thermophilicity, including several annotated in metal transport. We then validated a subset of screen hits with a directed, single-gene knockout paradigm. The results revealed a temperature-dependent regulatory logic for germination, the decision point by which a fungal spore initiates growth in replete conditions. Surprisingly, most of our T. thermophilus mutants germinated far better at 50{degrees}C than the wild-type in standard medium and showed markedly slower germination at lower temperatures. We hypothesized that T. thermophilus has evolved sophisticated regulatory machinery to block germination at high temperature unless conditions are suitable. As a proof of concept, we surveyed media conditions and established that elevated zinc dampened germination of wild-type T. thermophilus at 50{degrees}C but promoted it at lower temperature.

These viruses alternate between vertebrates and arthropods, facing distinct selection pressures in each host type. Surprisingly, whether specific mechanisms facilitate host alternation remains unclear. Here, we use bluetongue virus (BTV) as a model to investigate two phenomena potentially facilitating host alternation: adaptive mutations and genome formula variation (GFV). First, we searched for mutations indicative of host adaptation in cattle, sheep, and midges infected during an epizooty. We found a limited number of parallel mutations. This result suggests that adaptive mutations are not a main mechanism facilitating host alternation in BTV. Second, we investigated a link of GFV with a proxy of viral fitness, the speed of virus dissemination in midges. We analyzed the genome formula (GF) in experimentally-infected Culicoides imicola midges, either with an infection disseminated into the head or not. GFs differed between dissemination levels, suggesting a link between GF and the speed of virus dissemination.  Finally, we investigated the mechanisms underlying GF generation. Currently, two scenarios have been proposed: random generation followed by selection, or directed generation through molecular mechanisms. To limit the influence of selection, we analyzed the GF after a single replication cycle in cell culture. GF values converged towards specific values among replicates. Moreover, GFs differed between arthropod and vertebrate cells. Thus, GF generation is not purely stochastic and is probably influenced by host-specific mechanisms. Overall, our findings highlight GFV as a potential mechanism facilitating BTV alternation across hosts, but not classical mutation-driven evolution.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

We find that clinical genomes are smaller (6.5{+/-}0.29 Mbp) than environmental genomes (6.7{+/-}0.29 Mbp, p = 0.002), and exhibit higher GC content (66.25{+/-}0.2% vs. 65.32{+/-}0.3%). Genome size is inversely correlated with GC content, with clinical isolates having both smaller genome size and increased GC content.

Here, we describe that past interaction of enterococci with Pseudomonas aeruginosa creates legacy effects that substantially alter their antibiotic tolerance and resistance evolution. Specifically, we find that the temporary exposure to pyocyanin, a secondary metabolite produced by P. aeruginosa, increases the efflux in enterococci.

These mutations lead to elevated extracellular pyruvate which helps the establishment a more tolerogenic infection microenvironment and favor bacterial persistence. Pyruvate exerts multiple roles: scavenges reactive oxygen species such as H2O2, suppresses host immune activation both in airway epithelial cells and macrophages, and increases bacterial survival during phagocytosis. This metabolic crosstalk promotes bacterial persistence while limiting host tissue damage, aligning with the concept of disease tolerance.

Through genomics analysis, we show that MIB-MIP systematically co-occurs with a cluster of 7 coding sequences corresponding to an atypical Type 3 F-ATPase termed \"F1-like X0\". Working in the model organism Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, we first performed a proteomics analysis to confirm that this ATPase is indeed expressed. We then generated two mutant strains in which the putative ATPase was either fully deleted, or rendered catalytically inactive through replacement of a conserved lysine residue in the Walker A motif of the ATPase {beta}-like subunit. Functional assays in presence of immune serum showed that both mutants are unable to protect themselves from agglutination by immunoglobulins despite the MIB-MIP system still being present.

The model incorporates plasmid exchange, antibiotic effects, and host heterogeneity. It integrates diverse data sources, including microbiota dynamics, community antibiotic consumption, and detailed surveillance data from a large university hospital, complemented by literature estimates. This model identifies mechanisms that enable coexistence of resistant and sensitive strains at both individual and population levels, revealing host heterogeneity as a critical driver of resistance persistence. Unlike classic epidemiological models, our analysis finds a continuum of colonization states within individuals rather than discrete resistant or sensitive categories, and highlights that realistic detection thresholds may substantially underestimate resistance prevalence. Finally, we use this framework to evaluate interventions such as hospital screening and isolation, showing that their impact strongly depends on local transmission dynamics and resistance prevalence.

J.", "abstract": "Polygenic scores aim to predict phenotypes from genetic data, yet they remain vulnerable to spurious correlations arising from environmental variation that covaries with population structure. While standard methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) mitigate this, quantifying the residual risk for specific applications remains challenging. Here, we develop a theoretical framework that quantifies the proportion of genetic variance in a GWAS panel explained by an external ancestry gradient (H), providing a direct measure of stratification susceptibility. We show that this baseline risk is amplified by the ascertainment process itself, which creates a directional bias ({Phi}) that is particularly strong for variants with intermediate probabilities of ascertainment. Applying this framework to the UK Biobank, we find that while uncorrected susceptibility is drastically higher in diverse cohorts, PCA correction effectively flattens this disparity. We observe that the residual susceptibility (H') in corrected diverse panels is often comparable to, or marginally lower than, that found in restricted homogeneous subsets, suggesting that sample diversity need not compromise stratification control. However, for both study designs, residual structure often remains just above or indistinguishable from the theoretical limit of detection. Because even undetectable levels of structure can accumulate to produce significant bias in highly polygenic scores, we introduce a diagnostic to calculate the critical magnitude of environmental confounding required to explain an observed signal. Using this diagnostic, we find that both the well-known divergence in height scores between Sardinia and mainland Europe and novel signals of divergence in systolic blood pressure scores within the British Isles appear relatively robust to residual stratification, albeit for different reasons. While the Sardinia signal would require moderate-to-strong environmental confounding to align with a vanishingly small residual ancestry axis, the systolic blood pressure signals would require implausibly large environmental effects to be explained as artifacts.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

However, they are dominated by nuclear pre-mRNA edits with limited immune relevance. Here we present the Cytoplasmic Editing Index (CEI) that quantifies editing specifically within dsRNA structures in mature cytoplasmic transcripts, which carry higher immunological risk. Analyzing over 25,000 RNA-seq samples, we demonstrate CEI captures ADARp150 activity and outperforms the global editing index in terms of sensitivity and signal-to-noise, enabling sharper tissue-specific profiling, enhanced detection power of infection-induced editing changes, and stronger association with cancer prognoses. An open-source, cloud-native pipeline delivers end-to-end, reproducible analysis at very low cost, supporting immediate, scalable adoption.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

M.; Johnson, P. Z.; Simon, A. E.", "abstract": "Direct RNA nanopore sequencing allows for the identification of full-length RNAs with a ~10% error rate consisting of mismatches and small deletions. These errors are thought to be randomly distributed and structure-independent since RNA/cDNA duplexes are generated to prevent RNA structure formation prior to sequencing. When analyzing citrus yellow vein associated virus (CY1) reads during infection of Nicotiana benthamiana, viral (+/-)foldback RNAs (i.e., viral plus [+]-strands joined to [-]-strands) showed significantly higher error rates (mismatches and deletions) in the 5' (+)RNA portion with errors that were relatively evenly distributed, while errors in the attached (-)RNA portion were less frequent and unevenly distributed. Non-foldback CY1 (+)RNAs from infected plants also showed an uneven distribution of errors, which correlated with errors in in vitro transcribed CY1 (+)RNA reads in both position and frequency. Hotspot errors in non-foldback CY1 (+)RNA and (-)RNA reads only weakly correlated, and hotspots were frequently located 5' of known structural elements. Since nanopore sequencing is also used to identify RNA modifications, which depend on base-specific sequencing errors, algorithms for RNA modification detection were also examined for bias. We found that multiple programs predicted RNA modifications in in vitro transcribed CY1 RNA at the same positions and with similar confidence levels as with in planta CY1 RNA. These data suggest that direct RNA sequencing contains inherent error biases that may be associated with post-translocation RNA folding and low sequence complexity, and therefore extrapolations based on sequencing error require special consideration.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

C.; Myerscough, D.; Wu, Y.; DeGrado, W.", "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that while random sequences are unlikely to fold into proteins of the length of globular proteins, repeated random sequences are more likely to adopt stably folded structures, with implications for molecular evolution. We used structure prediction methods to determine the foldability of approximately 120-residue sequences composed of 5- to 60-residue random repeats. With repeats of less than 30-residues, sequences were frequently discovered (1-12%) that fold with high confidence. For less than 60-residue repeats, we frequently observe {beta}-solenoids, similar to those seen in natural proteins. We observe solenoids stabilized by apolar packing as well as ones stabilized by polar interactions with Ca2+ in the core of the structure as in natural RTX domains. Helical bundles were observed with high frequency when insertions or deletions (INDELs) were included between blocks of repeating sequences. We also observed a new super-secondary structure consisting of a tightly wound -helical screw, and experimentally confirmed its stability and structure by CD spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Thus, structure predictors can discover structures that are well out of the distribution of the data upon which they were trained. Beyond 40-residue repeat lengths very few sequences were predicted to fold. The small number of structures we observed were representative of well-established major classes of tertiary structures; greater sampling would be needed to discover novel structures from a random distribution. These studies illuminate dark matter regions of protein structure space and support previous predictions that proteins evolved through the assortment of shorter peptide sequences.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

In this study, we observe that the gene, arvA, is required for A. fumigatus morphogenesis, antifungal drug susceptibility, and cell wall homeostasis. Intriguingly, our study reveals novel morphological and growth aberrations in the absence of arvA. Loss of arvA results in hyper-swollen conidia that give rise to stunted, polarity-deficient hyphae in numerous environmental conditions, indicating a pivotal role for arvA in A. fumigatus morphogenesis. Surprisingly, despite these severe in vitro morphological and cell wall defects, arvA was not required for morbidity and mortality in immunologically distinct murine models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). However, growth in natural calf lung surfactant was able to normalize{Delta} arvA growth with the wild-type strain suggesting lung surfactant may partially complement the severe in vitro morphological defects of arvA loss in vivo. Taken together our observations reveal arvA as a mediator of A. fumigatus antifungal drug susceptibility and highlight the complex and ill-defined pulmonary nutrient environments role in mediating A. fumigatus pathogenesis and disease progression.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

L.; Birket, S. E.; Kiedrowski, M. R.", "abstract": "Muco-obstructive airway diseases result in an increase in mucus accumulation and a decrease in mucus clearance. MUC5B is the most abundant secreted mucin in the human airways, and MUC5B mucin strands dimerize to create the mucus mesh network in the healthy respiratory tract. In muco-obstructive airway diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), immune cells and bacteria release enzymes that degrade MUC5B into smaller fragments that become entangled and compacted, contributing to pathogenesis. We utilized synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum media (SCFM) to examine how mucin polymers can impact Staphylococcus aureus, a common CF pathogen that persists despite highly effective modulator therapies to correct CF disease. We found low molecular weight (LMW) mucin negatively impacts S. aureus survival and biofilm biomass compared to high molecular weight (HMW) mucin. Adding extracellular DNA to SCFM with LMW mucin was not sufficient to restore growth. LMW mucin had a broad negative impact on S. aureus laboratory strains and CF clinical isolates. We next tested other CF pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and saw no significant differences in growth in HMW or LMW mucin. LMW mucin did not significantly impact Staphylococcus epidermidis growth, indicating there may be specific interactions with S. aureus. Overall, this work highlights how interactions with pathogenic mucins may limit S. aureus growth in the diseased airways while supporting low-level persistence, and its ability to thrive in the presence of longer mucin strands may help to explain why S. aureus is well adapted to survive in the healthy respiratory tract.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

However, the behavior of flavin diffusion within biofilms remains poorly understood. In this study, we developed a colony-based electrochemical platform using interdigitated electrode arrays to quantify the diffusion coefficients of flavins within bacterial biofilms. We found that flavin diffusivity was about 11-fold enhanced in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilms than in the bulk solution. However, this enhancement was abolished in the gene deletion mutant that lacked the membrane-associated flavin-binding c-type cytochrome OmcA, which suggests that the flavin-OmcA interaction on cell surfaces facilitates flavin diffusion within the biofilm. Notably, the diffusion coefficients of other redox molecules, such as methylene blue and safranin, scarcely improved in biofilms, which validates the inference that flavin-specific interaction-accelerated diffusion occurs in biofilm environments. These findings uncover a phenomenon promoting long-range electron transfer, overturning the prevailing assumption that shuttling-based EET is hindered by slow molecular diffusion in biofilms. Our study highlights the functional importance of cell-surface cytochromes in overcoming the kinetic limitation of diffusion-based electron transfer, thereby shaping the bioenergetics in biofilms.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Botrytis pseudocinerea is a cryptic fungal species, morphologically indistinguishable from the notorious plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea, yet their distinct ecological behaviours suggest fundamental biological differences. This study resolves the paradox of why B. pseudocinerea, despite intrinsic resistance to the fungicide fenhexamid, often fails to dominate agricultural ecosystems. Remarkably, we demonstrate that B. pseudocinerea VD165 exhibits superior vegetative growth and stress tolerance compared to B. cinerea B05.10, coupled with heightened virulence on solanaceous hosts like tomato and tobacco. A comprehensive bio-guided chemical investigation combined with targeted gene expression analysis reveals a fundamental schism in its secondary metabolism. The VD165 isolate of B. pseudocinerea produces a potent phytotoxic cocktail of botcinin polyketides, a strategy supported by the constitutive and infection-induced strong upregulation of the Bcboa6 and Bcboa9 biosynthetic genes. Critically, we establish that it has completely lost the botrydial sesquiterpene pathway, a primary virulence factor in B. cinerea. The significant accumulation of the upstream terpene precursor mevalonolactone provides definitive biochemical evidence for this truncated pathway. This metabolic switch--the evolutionary loss of one major toxin gene cluster and the compensatory upregulation of another-- mirrors the co-regulatory mechanism previously demonstrated through genetic knockout of the botrydial pathway in B. cinerea and is a pivotal event that has shaped the unique pathogenic identity of B. pseudocinerea. This finding provides a model for how loss-of-function events in secondary metabolism can redefine host specificity and virulence in fungal pathogens--an evolutionary principle applicable across microbial taxa.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Q.; Huo, J.; Gao, X. N.; Lin, X.; Molkentin, J. D.; Meng, Q.", "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of global mortality, with myocardial fibrosis characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition representing a common endpoint associated with progressive cardiac dysfunction. While studies in animal models of heart disease suggest that preventing or reducing fibrosis can antagonize negative ventricular remodeling, current therapeutic strategies remain clinically limited and ineffective, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the multifactorial nature of the fibrotic process. Methods and Results: We employed artificial intelligence (AI) trained from 6528 cardiac fibrosis publications over the past decade, which suggested 10 nodal signaling pathways underlying the fibrotic process. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to quantify pathway activities across mouse models and clinical samples encompassing acute and chronic cardiac injury. Dynamic enrichment analysis revealed 2 critical pathways involved in acute myocardial infarction (MI) injury driven temporally-regulated fibrosis whereby Janus kinase - Signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling peaked early (day 7) while transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) pathway activity peaked mid-phase (day 14). With more chronically-driven fibrosis, JAK-STAT signaling again emerged, which this time was persistently active during chronic transverse aortic constriction (TAC) injury. Experimentally, single-cell analysis identified a pathogenic myofibroblast subpopulation characterized by high JAK-STAT signaling and ECM secretion capacity. Fibroblast-specific Jak1/2 gene-deleted mice significantly reduced TAC-induced fibrosis by blocking myofibroblast formation from this subpopulation, although these same mice failed to show attenuated fibrosis following MI injury, suggesting a pathway that would be ideal to therapeutically target for chronic fibrosis without affecting necessary acute scar formation. Indeed, based on the predictive AI driven algorithm, a temporal inhibitory strategy was generated for JAK-STAT and TGF-? that permitted compensatory scar formation while more effectively preventing progressive fibrosis and worsened cardiac function versus either singular pathway or chronic antagonism. Conclusion: Here we employed the wealth of past signaling pathway data underlying cardiac fibrosis to train an AI model, which suggested an optimized approach of inhibiting 2 nodal signaling pathways but with differential timing as a more effective therapeutic strategy that reduces pathologic cardiac fibrosis without negatively impacting compensatory fibrotic activity with acute MI injury. The therapeutic approach involves altering the timing of JAK-STAT signaling blockade with ruxolitinib (RUX) in combination with delayed and temporary TGF-? signaling inhibition post MI injury with pirfenidone (PFD).", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}

Currently, most clustering algorithms measure cell-to-cell similarities using distance metrics based on the assumption that each cluster is comprised of \"nearby\" neighbors. In effect, clusters are a collection of similar cells in the embedded metric. Here, we propose that biological clusters should be comprised of sets of cells that satisfy a set of stochiometric constraints, whose intersections define a cell type. We propose to model each cell population with a single affine subspace, where all cells of the same type share a common set of linear constraints. We present an algorithm that leverages this subspace structure and learns a cell-to-cell affinity matrix based on notions of subspace similarity. We simulate scRNA-seq data according to the subspace model and benchmark our algorithm against pre-existing methods. We further benchmark our algorithm on a C. elegans dataset and show recovery of information on both cell type and developmental time. Lastly, we find the subspaces that our algorithm recovers allow us to find biologically significant genes involved in an organism's development.", "date": "2025-12-04", "journal": ""}
