As with PRG-1/piRNAs, mutations in the nuclear RNA interference gene nrde-1 compromised germ cell immortality, but deficiency for daf-2 did not suppress the transgenerational sterility of nrde-1 or nrde-4 single mutants or of prg-1; nrde-4 or prg-1; hrde-1 double mutants. NRDE-1 and NRDE-4 promote transcriptional silencing in somatic cells via the nuclear Argonaute protein NRDE-3, which was dispensable for germ cell immortality. However, daf-2 deficiency failed to promote germ cell immortality in prg-1; nrde-3 mutants. Consistently, we found that DAF-16 activity in somatic cells suppressed the transgenerational sterility of prg-1 mutants via the SID-1 dsRNA transmembrane channel that promotes systemic RNAi as well as Dicer, the dsRNA binding protein RDE-4 and the RDRP RRF-3. We conclude that DAF-16 activates a cell-non-autonomous systemic RNAi pathway that promotes small RNA-mediated genome silencing in germ cells to suppress loss of the genomic immune surveillance factor Piwi/PRG-1.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

While coherent brain-wide patterns of neural activity have been observed in neuronal populations, very little is known about their dimensionality, geometry, and how they are correlated with sensory inputs. Here, we recorded the activity of most head neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans experiencing changes in bacterial or control buffer stimuli around their nose. We first classified active neurons into six functional clusters: two sensory neuron clusters (ON and OFF responding to addition and removal of stimuli, respectively) and four motor/command neuron clusters (AVA, RME, SMDD and SMDV). Next, we estimated stimulus selectivity for each cluster and found that while sensory neurons exhibit their maximal responses within 15 seconds, changes in bacterial stimuli drive maximal responses in command and motor neuron clusters after tens of seconds. Furthermore, we show that bacterial stimuli induce neural dynamics that are best described by a hyperbolic, not Euclidean, space, of dimensionality eight. The hyperbolic space provided a better description of neural activity than the standard Euclidean space. This space can be separated into three components - one sensory, and two motor directions (forward-backward and dorsal-ventral). Collectively, we show that C. elegans neural activity can be effectively represented in low-dimensional hyperbolic space to describe a sensorimotor transformation.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

How novel left-right asymmetries arise remains unknown. Here, we examined Drosophila pachea, where males have evolved unique asymmetric genitalia lobes and a right-sided copulation posture in the past 3-6 million years. We found that male asymmetric lobes grow in pupae during a 360{degrees} clockwise genitalia rotation, a conserved and widespread developmental process in flies. Using two complementary approaches, drug application and a CRISPR-induced MyoID mutant, we altered genitalia rotation and found that asymmetric lobe sizes depend on genitalia rotation completion, while the sidedness of lobe asymmetry is determined by the rotation direction. We then investigated the impact of genital asymmetry on copulation posture. Males with reversed genital asymmetry still mate in the typical right-sided posture, indicating that right-sided behavior is not determined by asymmetric male genitalia. Our study reveals that a novel genitalia asymmetry has evolved through the co-option of a pre-existing tissue remodeling process. Tissue rotation represents a new mechanism, through which a bilateral organ can acquire a left-right size asymmetry.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Despite its importance, the mechanisms of DPCR at the organismal level are largely unknown. Proteases play a central role in DPCR, as they remove proteinaceous part of the DPCs, while the peptide remnant crosslinked to DNA is subsequently removed by other repair factors. We characterized the role of putative protease ACRC/GCNA (ACidic Repeat Containing/Germ Cell Nuclear Antigen) in DPCR at the organismal level. For this purpose, we have created new animal models with CRISPR/Cas system: two zebrafish lines with inactive Acrc. We were able to overcome the early embryonic lethality caused by Acrc inactivation by injecting Acrc-WT mRNA and have created a viable animal model to study the role of Acrc in adult tissues. We identified histone H3, topoisomerases 1 and 2, Dnmt1, Parp1, Polr3a and Mcm2 as DPC substrates of Acrc.

To test this, we examined the effects of HFD and sex on SSCT thickening and markers of fibrosis using our established CTS rabbit model of SSCT thickening. Forty-eight (24 male, 24 female) adult rabbits were split into four groups including HFD or standard diet with and without CTS induction. SSCT was collected for histological and gene expression analysis. HFD promoted SSCT thickening and upregulated profibrotic genes, including TGF-{beta}. Fibrotic genes were differentially expressed in males and females. Interestingly while the overall prevalence of CTS is greater in women than in men, under conditions of metabolic dysfunction men have a higher incidence. This suggests a focus on metabolic and sex specific therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with CTS.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

In E. coli, cell wall growth was thought to proceed independently from turgor pressure, the osmotic pressure that the cytoplasm exerts on the cell wall. Here, we uncover a striking increase of turgor pressure with growth rate. Modulating turgor pressure and measuring cell wall biosynthesis, we find that turgor pressure is directly controls the rate of cell wall biosynthesis. The picture that emerges is that turgor pressure is largely generated by counterions of negatively charged cellular biomass. The increase in turgor pressure with growth rates results from more ribosomes and therefore higher concentrations of negatively charged ribosomal RNA. Elegantly, the coupling between biomass composition, turgor pressure and cell wall biosynthesis simultaneously explains how bacteria achieve homeostasis of cytoplasmic crowding and how they regulate the rate of cell wall biosynthesis across growth rates.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Using TCR reporter mouse models and phosphoproteomics, we demonstrate that TCR signaling is intrinsically suppressed in natural T-IELs. We discover that this suppression occurs post-selection in the thymus through altered expression of TCR signalosome components, a mechanism we term RePrESS (Rewiring of Proximal Elements of TCR Signalosome for Suppression). RePrESS is evolutionarily conserved and also found in autoreactive innate-like T cells from skin, breast and prostate. In coeliac disease, tolerance breakdown is associated with loss of RePrESS in natural T-IELs.

Whether and how telomeres, on the other hand, influence hTERT regulation is relatively less studied. We found hTERT was transcriptionally altered depending on telomere length (TL). This resulted from TL-dependent binding of TRF2 between telomeres and the hTERT promoter. hTERT promoter-bound TRF2 was non-telomeric and did not involve the looping of telomeres to the hTERT promoter. Cell lines from different tissue types (fibrosarcoma (HT1080), colon cancer (HCT116), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), engineered for either telomere elongation/shortening gave increase/decrease in hTERT, respectively. Mechanistically, we show hTERT promoter-bound non-telomeric TRF2 recruits the canonical PRC2-complex inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation in a TL-dependent fashion. This was further supported by TL-dependent promoter activity from an exogenously inserted hTERT reporter. Increase in TL over days followed by gradual decline, resulted in activation followed by repression of hTERT in a concerted manner, further implicating TL as a key factor for hTERT regulation. Notably on reprogramming primary fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), TRF2 loss from the hTERT promoter was evident along with telomere elongation and hTERT upregulation. Conversely, on telomere shortening in iPSCs, hTERT promoter-bound TRF2 was restored with marked reduction in hTERT further supporting the causal role of TL in hTERT transcription. Mechanisms of tight control of hTERT by TL shown here are likely to have major implications in telomere-related physiologies, particularly, cancer, ageing and pluripotency.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we engineer a murine delayed-healing model using tunable intramedullary nails to impose controlled interfragmentary strains, mimicking human hypertrophic nonunion. High-strain fractures (15-30%) generated larger calluses with delayed ossification, 2.9-fold increase in fibrotic tissue (p = 0.0099), and inferior biomechanical strength (stiffness: 1.6-fold lower, p = 0.024) compared to low-strain controls (<5%). Spatial transcriptomics revealed persistent fibrotic niches in high-strain calluses enriched with fibroblast-associated genes (Pdgfrb, Lgals3) alongside dysregulated macrophage-osteoclast signaling (Spp1, Mmp9). Systemic immune profiling revealed CD206+ macrophages and CD25+ T-regulatory cells as predictive biomarkers, with early polarization determining long-term outcomes (R = 0.72, p = 0.004). Multivariate modeling linked delayed healing to persistent CD8+ T cells and deficient Treg recruitment, perpetuating inflammation.

The pre-replication complex (comprising Orc1-6, Cdc6, Cdt1, and MCM) is essential for the initiation of DNA replication, but the dynamics and function of Orc6 during the cell cycle remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Orc6 associates with chromatin during G1-phase and dissociates upon S-phase entry. The dissociation of Orc6 from chromatin is dependent on proteasome activity, and inhibition of the proteasome leads to the accumulation of chromatin-bound Orc6, which promotes abnormal MCM loading after S-phase entry without undergoing mitosis in human immortalized hTERT-RPE1 cells. Following release from proteasome inhibition, cells with elevated levels of chromatin-bound Orc6 and MCM proceed to the next replication phase as tetraploid cells.

Comprehending how cardiac cells perceive and respond to biomechanical forces is a biological process with significant medical implications that remains poorly understood. Here we show that biomechanical forces activate endocardial id2b (inhibitor of DNA binding 2b) expression, thereby promoting cardiac contractility and valve formation. Taking advantage of the unique strengths of zebrafish, particularly the viability of embryos lacking heartbeats, we systematically compared the transcriptomes of hearts with impaired contractility to those of control hearts. This comparison identified id2b as a gene sensitive to blood flow. By generating a knockin reporter line, our results unveiled the presence of id2b in the endocardium, and its expression is sensitive to both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. Furthermore, id2b loss-of-function resulted in progressive heart malformation and early lethality. Combining RNA-seq analysis, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography, we discovered profound impairment in atrioventricular (AV) valve formation and defective excitation-contraction coupling in id2b mutants. Mechanistically, deletion of id2b reduced AV endocardial cell proliferation and led to a progressive increase in retrograde blood flow. In the myocardium, id2b directly interacted with the bHLH component tcf3b (transcription factor 3b) to restrict its activity. Inactivating id2b unleashed its inhibition on tcf3b, resulted in enhanced repressor activity of tcf3b, which subsequently suppressed the expression of nrg1 (neuregulin 1), an essential mitogen for heart development.

Due to genetic bottlenecks invasive species often have reduced genetic diversity. However, they must quickly adapt to changes in new environments, potentially including anthropogenic countermeasures. This paradox raises a fundamental question: how do species adapt to changes while having low genetic diversity? This tension is more pronounced for some species, for example parasites go through additional bottlenecks between hosts and haplodiploid species have a lower effective population size, as males can inherit and transmit only half of their mother's genome. To investigate how species with such traits reconcile diversity and adaptability, we examined inheritance in the Varroa mite (Varroa destructor), a well-studied invasive parasite of honey bees fitting all of the above criteria. By following the flow of alleles across three-generation pedigrees we found that Varroa, so far believed to be haplodiploid, is actually not. Rather, it has a unique reproductive system in which females clonally produce functionally diploid sons. While males lose somatic DNA during development, they can transmit either maternal allele to their daughters with equal probability. Modeling shows Varroa loses heterozygosity slower under typical sib-mating conditions, relative to haplodiploidy. This permits a greater effective population size relative to a purely haplodiploid system and increased evolutionary potential. This reversion to diploidy is a singular example of escaping the \"evolutionary trap\" of haplodiploidy, which is believed to be an evolutionary stable end state. Plasticity in reproductive systems could be more common than assumed, and may potentially explain the remarkable resilience and high adaptivity of Varroa and other invasive parasites.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

The RIP assay, mRNA stability assay and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. We demonstrated that phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) promoted metastasis and EMT progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpresssed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting-RNAs, and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET.

We conducted a leaf disc bioassay to assess soil infectious potential on a subset of samples collected in the field and evaluated whether the ddPCR-based assessment of inoculum concentration had an epidemiological significance. Soil infectious potential estimated through infected leaf-disc area was positively correlated with our DNA-based quantification of oospores. This approach could be used to quantify soil oospores in vineyards, which would be useful to improve models for epidemic risk prediction and decision-making tools.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

However, training an HMM on cortical data requires a careful handling of model selection, since models with more numerous hidden states generally have a higher likelihood on new (unseen) data. A potentially related problem is the occurrence of very rapid state switching after decoding the data with an HMM. The first problem can lead to overfitting and over-segmentation of the data. The second problem is due to intermediate- to-low self-transition probabilities and is at odds with many reports that hidden states in cortex tend to last from hundred of milliseconds to seconds. Here, we show that we can alleviate both problems by regularizing a Poisson-HMM during training so as to enforce large self-transition probabilities. We call this algorithm the 'sticky Poisson-HMM' (sPHMM). When used together with the Bayesian Information Criterion for model selection, the sPHMM successfully eliminates rapid state switching, outperforming an alternative strategy based on an HMM with a large prior on the self-transition probabilities. The sPHMM also captures the ground truth in surrogate datasets built to resemble the statistical properties of the experimental data.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

It was trained and validated using 854 manually labeled scans from pediatric datasets, with independent samples used to ensure performance generalizability. The model integrates multiscale image features, spatial priors, and self-attention mechanisms within a compact encoder-decoder architecture to enhance boundary detection. Validation across multiple imaging centers and age groups shows that AmygdalaGo-BOLT closely matches expert manual labels, improves processing efficiency, and outperforms existing tools in accuracy.

In this study, we show that the nematode C. elegans makes sensory-guided turns while foraging and can maintain a working memory of sensory activation prior to the execution of a turn. This information is integrated with body posture to localize appetitive stimuli. Using a virtual-reality whole-brain imaging and neural perturbation system, we find that this working memory is implemented by the coupled oscillations of two distributed neural motor command complexes. One complex decouples from motor output after sensory evidence accumulation, exhibits persistent oscillatory dynamics, and initiates turn execution. The second complex serves as a reference timer. We propose that the implementation of working memory via internalization of motor oscillations could represent the evolutionary origin of internal neural processing, i.e. thought, and a foundation of higher cognition.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

To better characterize the role of each of the actors involved in sour rot expression, we conducted experiments involving the isolation of 1593 fungi and bacteria to understand the composition and dynamics of the microbiomes associated with healthy berries, diseased berries and insect vectors. As some grape clusters became symptomatic for sour rot in the absence of acetic acid bacteria, the latter might not necessarily be needed for disease expression. Similar to other yeast genera, the yeast genus Geotrichum is here also reported for the first time to be able to initiate sour rot in grapes, however, this finding has to be confirmed by further studies. By allowing or denying the access of insect vectors to intact or artificially wounded grapes we could emphasize that they accelerate the expression of the disease when berries are injured. Moreover, the microbial communities identified on native vinegar flies (Drosophila spp.) and the introduced Drosophila suzukii were similar and yeast dominated. This highlights the key role of these insect vectors in the transmission of microorganisms inflicting sour rot to wounded berries. Finally, our data also suggest that sour rot and grey mould can coexist in a vineyard at an advanced stage of grape decomposition, which runs counter to recent studies that emphasize the supremacy of sour rot over grey mould.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Why telomere length varies so widely remains unknown, though popular hypotheses suggest that body size, lifespan, and endothermy are key variables that have coevolved with telomere length. To test the relationship among telomere length, telomerase activity (which extends telomeres), and these variables, we modeled the evolution of telomere length across 122 vertebrate species. We failed to find an influence of body mass, lifespan, or baseline metabolism on telomere length. However, we found a significant interactive effect between baseline metabolism and body mass. The presence of telomerase activity was positively correlated with telomere length across the 58 species where data for both existed. Taken together, our findings suggest that body mass may have differentially influenced the evolution of telomere length in endotherms and ectotherms and indicate that telomerase activity and telomere length may have coevolved.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

How these GTPases are appropriately positioned at the opposite poles of migrating cells is unknown.

Rac-based protrusion stimulates Rho activation at the opposite side of the cell via membrane tension-based activation of mTORC2. Conversely, Rho-based contraction induces cortical-flow-based regulation of phosphoinositide signaling to trigger Rac activation at the opposite side of the cell. We develop a minimal unifying mechanochemical model of the cell to explain how this long-range facilitation complements local inhibition to enable robust Rho and Rac partitioning. We show that this long-range mutual activation of Rac and Rho is conserved in epithelial cells and is also essential for efficient polarity and migration of primary human T cells, indicating the generality of this circuit.

While changed gene expression is a primary driver of these adaptations, the underlying role of 3D genome organization - a key regulator of gene expression - remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the 3D genome architecture of the livers of surface fish and two cavefish morphs (Pachon and Tinaja) using Hi-C, performing the first comparative 3D genomic analysis in this species. We analyzed and identified cave-specific 3D genomic features, such as genomic compartments and loops, which were conserved in both the cave populations but absent in surface fish. Integrating the 3D genome data with transcriptomic and epigenetic datasets, linked these changes to differential expression of metabolically relevant genes, such as Arhgef19 and Endog. Additionally, our study also uncovered genomic inversions unique to cavefish, potentially tied to cave adaptation. Our findings suggest that 3D genome organization contributes to transcriptomic shifts underlying cavefish phenotypes, providing a novel intra-species and morph specific perspective on 3D chromatin evolution.

P.", "abstract": "The bactericidal nature of obligately lytic bacterial viruses (phages) is of increasing interest for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections, either administered alone or in combination with antibiotics. In contrast, temperate phages are largely ignored in a therapeutic context due to their ability to lie dormant within the bacterial host. However, these phages often undergo a lytic cycle. Furthermore, even in their dormant state they can be a considerable burden to the bacterium - most famously by their ability to switch to lytic replication in response to environmental triggers, such as antibiotics, that stress the bacterial host. Recent reports of antibiotics synergizing with temperate phages in vitro, termed 'temperate phage antibiotic synergy' (tPAS), present a potentially scalable opportunity to make use of these abundant entities for the treatment of bacterial infections. Here we employ Caenorhabditis elegans as a robust in vivo animal model for testing the efficacy of temperate phages as adjuvants to antibiotics. In vivo, temperate phage Hali alone results in 60% dormancy in the bacterial survivors. However, the antibiotic ciprofloxacin can abolish dormancy of temperate phage Hali - infecting a ciprofloxacin resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strain. The phage Hali-ciprofloxacin pairing increased the lifespan of P. aeruginosa infected worms to that of the uninfected control, at doses where neither the phage nor the antibiotic had any effect alone. Complete rescue was also observed in worms infected with a phage-carrying strain treated with the otherwise ineffective antibiotic, supporting that the phage - even in its dormant form - can greatly enhance antibiotic effectiveness. This illustrates potential 'accidental' phage therapy when antibiotics are prescribed. Our work establishes C. elegans as a suitable model for studying the in vivo efficacy of tPAS and is the first in vivo demonstration of this synergy, greatly expanding the therapeutic potential of temperate phages.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

However, there is a paucity of sex disaggregated studies measuring the relationship between cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism, despite metabolic and vascular factors being considered primary drivers of age-related cognitive decline and dementias like Alzheimers, which disproportionally affect women. Here we address this gap by assessing the association of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in the functional networks of 79 younger and older females and males, who completed a simultaneous MR/PET scan and cognitive battery. Our results extend previously reported age-related declines in CBF and CMRglc by demonstrating that their interrelationship changes with age and sex. Older age was associated with a reduction in the correlation strength between network CBF and CMRglc. CBF-CMRglc associations across people were moderated by sex, with significant negative associations in older females, a pattern not seen in older males nor younger adults. People with higher CBF-CMRglc correlations had better cognitive performance. We conclude that older adults lose synchronised vascular and metabolic dynamics in large-scale functional network, which are necessary for cognitive processes. Older females show strong, negative network CBF-CMRglc correlations, possibly reflecting a compensatory response in the face or attenuated rates of blood flow and glucose metabolism.

J.; Le Goff, K.; Dehais, F.", "abstract": "Objective: Sustaining vigilance over extended periods is crucial for many critical operations but remains challenging due to the cognitive resources required. Fatigue and other factors contribute to fluctuations in vigilance, causing attentional focus to drift from task-relevant information. Such lapses of attention, common in prolonged tasks, lead to decreased performance and missed critical information, with potentially serious consequences. Identifying physiological markers that predict inattention is key to developing preventive strategies. Approach: Previous research has established electroencephalography (EEG) responses to periodic visual stimuli, known as steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), as sensitive markers of attention. In this study, we evaluated a minimally intrusive SSVEP-based approach for tracking vigilance in healthy participants (N = 16) during two sessions of a 45-minute sustained visual attention task (Mackworth's clock task). A 14 Hz frequency-tagging flicker was either superimposed on the task or absent. Main results: Results revealed that SSVEP responses were lower prior to lapses of attention, while other spectral EEG markers, such as frontal theta and parietal alpha activity, did not reliably distinguish between detected and missed attention probes. Importantly, the flicker did not affect task performance or participant experience. Significance: This non-intrusive frequency-tagging method provides a continuous measure of vigilance, effectively detecting attention lapses in prolonged tasks.

T6SSs are gut colonization factors that influence gut biodiversity. Hemolysin-coregulated proteins (Hcp) are major structural proteins in these systems. Hcp forms hexameric rings that stack to create an inner tube structure essential for translocating effector proteins into target cells. In Bacteroidales, T6SS loci encode multiple Hcp proteins with unknown function. The gut commensal Bacteroides fragilis encodes five Hcp subunits (sHcp and Hcp1-4) that have low sequence similarity. In this study, we investigated the roles of these proteins. Interaction studies showed that sHcp forms homohexamers, which is consistent with a major role of forming the bulk of the inner tube. In contrast, the less abundant minor Hcp1-4 were shown to form an interaction network involving heteromeric complexes. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that Hcp1 and Hcp2 assemble into heterohexamers and that this complex recognizes the secreted effector Bte1. Finally, we showed that Hcp modules, which are encoded in highly syntenic regions in T6SS loci of Bacteroidales, cluster with effectors. These results imply that the minor Hcps genetically cosegregate with cognate effectors, contributing to effector cassette variability. Thus, minor Hcp subunits function as recognition particles for effectors to mediate secretion, which appears to be a conserved trait in Bacteroidales T6SSs. Exploiting these features could facilitate the characterization of unknown effectors by copurifying them with their cognate Hcps. This approach may reveal new insights into bacterial interactions and the mechanisms that establish gut biodiversity.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

RBPs often act as RNA chaperones, facilitating the sRNA-mRNA duplex formation. One of the most studied sRNA chaperones is Hfq, the post-transcriptional gene regulator in bacteria. Recently, a new RNA-chaperone protein, ProQ, has been discovered, which binds to a novel sRNA RaiZ, derived from the 3'-end of mRNA encoding ribosome-inactivating protein, and promotes its base pairing with the ribosome binding site of hupA mRNA, leading to the repression of HU-alpha protein synthesis. Despite these studies, the RNA-binding mechanism in ProQ has not been well explored in detail to date. In this work, we studied the binding of raiZ RNA to ProQ using atomistic long-timescale molecular dynamics and on-the-fly probability-based enhanced sampling (OPES) simulations. The raiZ RNA binds to ProQ's concave surface, mostly decorated with polar and positively charged residues like Arginine and Lysine, exerting electrostatic stabilization to the RNA. In-silico mutations of these crucial residues lead to a significant loss of the intermolecular interactions, resulting in the detachment of the RNA from the protein. The free energy surface obtained from the OPES simulation helps identify stable raiZ-bound ProQ structures as well as intermediate states.

These sketches are typically much smaller than the input sequences, but preserve sufficient information for downstream analysis. Minimizers are an especially popular sketching technique and used in a wide variety of applications. They sample at least one out of every w consecutive k-mers. As DNA sequencers are getting more accurate, some applications can afford to use a larger w and hence sparser and smaller sketches. And as sketches get smaller, their analysis becomes faster, so the time spent sketching the full-sized input becomes more of a bottleneck. Our library simd-minimizers implements a random minimizer algorithm using SIMD instructions. It supports both AVX2 and NEON architectures. Its main novelty is two-fold. First, it splits the input into 8 chunks that are streamed over in parallel through all steps of the algorithm. This is enabled by using the completely deterministic two-stacks sliding window minimum algorithm, which seems not to have been used before for finding minimizers. Our library is up to 6.8x faster than a scalar implementation of the rescan method when w=5 is small, and 3.4x faster for larger w=19. Computing canonical minimizers is less than 50% slower than computing forward minimizers, and around 15x faster than the existing implementation in the minimizer-iter crate. Our library finds all (canonical) minimizers of a 3.2 Gbp human genome in 5.2 (resp. 6.7) seconds.

Fundamental to the assessment of particle performance are in vitro particle-cell interaction experiments. These experiments can be summarised with key parameters that facilitate objective comparisons across various cell and particle pairs, such as the particle-cell association rate. Previous studies often focus on point estimates of such parameters and neglect heterogeneity in routine measurements. In this study, we develop an ordinary differential equation-based mechanistic mathematical model that incorporates and exploits the heterogeneity in routine measurements. Connecting this model to data using approximate Bayesian computation parameter inference and prediction tools, we reveal the significant role of heterogeneity in parameters that characterise particle-cell interactions. We then generate predictions for key quantities, such as the time evolution of the number of particles per cell. Finally, by systematically exploring how the choice of experimental time points influences estimates of key quantities, we identify optimal experimental time points that maximise the information that is gained from particle-cell interaction experiments.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

For mutagenesis methods, an ideal goal is to reach the efficiency of 100%. Towards this goal, we have recently taken the first step by adopting an innovative strategy using primer pairs with 3-prime overhangs and developing P3 site-directed mutagenesis, with an average efficiency of ~50%. As the second step towards the ideal goal, we report here P3a site-directed mutagenesis with an efficiency reaching ~100%. We systematically evaluated this new method by engineering >100 point mutations and small deletions (or insertions) on >20 mammalian expression vectors encoding various epigenetic regulators and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. As all known mutagenesis methods are limited to point mutations and small deletions/insertions (up to a dozen nucleotides), the technical problem is how to carry out cassette mutagenesis for replacement, deletion or insertion of large DNA fragments. The high efficiency of P3a mutagenesis and the handshaking feature of primer pairs with 3-prime overhangs inspired us to adapt this new method for seamless cassette mutagenesis, including highly efficient epitope tagging and untagging, deletion of small and large DNA fragments (up to 5 kb) and insertion of primer pairs possessing gene fragments (up to ~0.4 kb), LoxP sites and sequences encoding degrons, sgRNA and tigRNA. Thus, this new site-specific and cassette mutagenesis method is highly efficient, fast and versatile, likely resulting in its wide use for typical biomedical research, as well as for engineering and refining synthetic or mutant proteins from AI-assisted design.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

C.-Y.", "abstract": "Background: Latest placental epigenetic clocks (PlECs) were claimed to be robust when applied to cases with either maternal or fetal adverse conditions. However, the accuracies in estimating gestational age (GA) were lower in earlier trimesters. We have developed a multistage predictive model to improve the accuracies, but it resulted in a large and complex PlEC, which may be less usable for non-computational scientists. To improve the usability of our PlEC, we aimed to develop an R package of PlEC to estimate aging by DNA-methylation-based GA (DNAm-GA). Methods: An R package was developed to simplify our scikit-learn models into a single function and to utilize DNAm-GA for placental aging study. We provided two functions to normalize DNA methylation values and estimate DNAm-GA. Both were designed to run such that a user can adjust the number of samples per batch to fit their computational resources. Our model was simplified into a simple additive operation to reduce the need for expensive computation. Furthermore, two functions to perform quality control and identify placental aging. Quality control is performed by root mean squared-error (RMSE), mean absolute difference, and correlation coefficient. We defined placental aging as the deviation of placental DNAm-GA from the true GA beyond that from the measurement error. Results: The simplified version of PlEC achieved similar performance with the original scikit-learn model with RMSE 0.102 (95% CI 0.101, 0.104), which was reasonably imperfect since Python and R handle floating/decimal numbers, differently. In our use case example, we could observe significant difference of placental aging in a specific period between case and control. Conclusions: Our R package could reduce the computational requirement to use our models and maintained the precision in estimating DNAm-GA and our analytical framework could utilize DNAm-GA for placental aging study. Our PlEC also allows individual assessment of placental aging in clinical settings via the residual DNAm-GA.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

DNA methylation profiling allows detailed tumor characterization. This study applies methylation-based deconvolution to define GBMs cellular composition and its association with patient outcomes. Methods: We generated oligodendroglial precursor cells at various developmental stages from enriched human neural progenitor cultures and used their DNA methylation signatures, along with published signatures of brain tumor and tumor microenvironment-relevant cell types, to deconvolve 263 adult GBMs (Heidelberg-cohort). Tumor purity was estimated using RF Purify. An independent cohort of 199 GBMs from TCGA and GEO, all treated with standard-of-care therapy, was similarly deconvolved, followed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to assess the prognostic value of neoplastic component proportions. Results: Deconvolution uncovered distinct cellular compositions, consistent with single-cell RNA sequencing findings. Tumor purity analysis showed neoplastic fractions averaged 70% of tumor bulk, predominantly oligodendrocyte-like (43%), oligodendrocyte precursor-like (27%), astrocyte-like (19%), and mesenchymal stem cell-like (11%) populations. Non-neoplastic fractions were enriched for macrophages, vascular cells, and immune populations. A higher oligodendrocyte-like signature was linked to poorer survival (median survival 14.3 vs. 15.3 months; p = 0.017), while a higher astrocyte-like signature correlated with improved outcomes (15.3 vs. 13.4 months; p = 0.044). The astrocyte-to-oligodendrocyte ratio emerged as a strong prognostic marker, with a higher ratio predicting significantly longer survival (15.8 vs. 11.9 months; p < 0.00011).

A.; van Dijk, B.", "abstract": "Genes encoding for virulence factors are frequently found on prophages, yet the evolutionary forces driving this association remain unclear. The evolutionary association of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) with host-beneficial genes is known to be hindered by the stability of chromosomal loci and competition with MGEs lacking accessory genes. Using a mathematical model that incorporates these constraints, we identify two key mechanisms that help overcome these barriers, resulting in the evolutionary linkage of accessory genes, like virulence genes, to prophages. First, we show that migration across bacterial populations favours the association of genes with prophages when the gene is beneficial in certain environments (e.g. virulence genes in the gut) that also trigger higher rates of prophage induction. Second, we show that within-population spatial dynamics also promotes the association of weakly selected genes and phages. Here, virion dispersal allows phage-encoded genes to spread into patches of bacteria lacking the gene, giving them a selective advantage over immobile chromosomal genes. We argue that these mechanisms are less applicable for plasmids and other MGEs, highlighting a potentially unique role for phages in shaping bacterial adaptation. By demonstrating how phage lifecycle dynamics and spatial heterogeneity drive MGE-gene associations, our work provides new insights into the evolution of phage-encoded virulence.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Yeast Dsk2 scaffolds proteasome-containing condensates via multivalent interactions with proteasomes and ubiquitinated substrates under azide-induced mitochondrial stress or extended growth conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying how these shuttle proteins work are unknown. Here, we identify that the middle chaperone-binding STI1 domain is the main driver of Dsk2 self-association and phase separation in vitro. Using NMR spectroscopy and computational simulations, we find that the STI1 domain interacts with three transient amphipathic helices within the intrinsically-disordered regions of Dsk2. Removal of either the STI1 domain or these helices significantly reduces the propensity for Dsk2 to phase separate. In vivo, removal of the STI1 domain in Dsk2 has the opposite effect, resulting in an increase of proteasome-containing condensates due to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated substrates. Modeling of STI1-helix interactions reveals a binding mode that is reminiscent of interactions between chaperone STI1/DP2 domains and client proteins containing amphipathic or transmembrane helices. Our findings support a model whereby STI1-helix interactions important for Dsk2 condensate formation can be replaced by STI1-client interactions for downstream chaperone or other protein quality control outcomes.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

While cancer driver mutations are well documented, their tissue specific effects remain largely attributed to genetic factors, leaving the biophysical aspects underexplored. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical interactions, specifically interfacial tension between newly transformed and wildtype epithelial cells are critical in determining survival and growth of HRasV12 oncogenic mutants in human mammary and bronchial epithelia, leading to contrasting outcomes in the two tissues. In mammary epithelium, isolated oncogenic cells are extruded, a typical mechanism of defense against cancer in epithelia, while oncogenic groups become spatially confined in a kinetically arrested, jammed state, marked by an actomyosin belt at the interface. In contrast, bronchial epithelium permits persistent spreading of the same oncogenic cells, which form long protrusions regardless of colony size. Furthermore, oncogenic clusters in these two tissues exhibit distinct biophysical properties, including variations in cell shapes, intracellular pressure, cell to cell line tension, and cellular motility. Using a cell shape tension coupled bidisperse vertex model, we reveal that differences in interfacial tension at mutant cell and wild-type cell boundaries dictate whether oncogenic cells are eliminated, restrained, or expanded and that modulating interfacial tension alters mutant cell fate within the epithelium.

We profiled DNAm using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), including technical and biological replicates from lab-reared and wild-caught threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We then compared how the most commonly used read mapper and methylation caller (Bismark) performed relative to two alternative pipelines (BWA mem or BWA meth read mappers analyzed with MethyDackel). BWA meth provided 50% higher mapping efficiency than BWA mem and 45% higher efficiency than Bismark. Despite differences in mapping efficiency, BWA meth and Bismark produced highly similar methylation profiles, while BWA mem systematically discarded unmethylated cytosines. Sequencing depth filters had large impacts on CpG sites recovered across multiple individuals, with the largest impact on WGBS data. Notably, the prevalence of CpG sites with intermediate methylation levels is greatly reduced in RRBS data compared to WGBS, which may have important consequences for functional interpretations. We conclude by discussing how library construction and bisulfite alignment wrappers can influence SNP filtering, genomic coverage, and the abundance and reliability of data available for downstream analysis.

Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is one form of transcranial electric stimulation (tES) in which an alternating current is passed between electrodes at random frequencies. High-frequency tRNS (hf-tRNS) is thought to enhance excitability and has been reported to have facilitatory effects on behavior in healthy and clinical populations. Due to the potential application of tRNS, clear demonstrations of the efficacy and replicability of stimulation are critical. Here, we focused on replicating the facilitatory effect of hf-tRNS over the human middle temporal complex (hMT+) on contralateral motion processing, initially demonstrated by Ghin et al. (2018). In this prior study, the improvement in performance was specific to global motion processing in the visual field contralateral to stimulation. The motivation to replicate this effect was reinforced by the well-supported hypothesis that hMT+ is critical for contralateral global motion processing. However, our results indicated that hf-tRNS does not improve motion discrimination. Specifically, we were unable to replicate a contralateral global motion processing facilitation following hf-tRNS to hMT+. In our within-subject controls, we also found no difference between hf-tRNS to hMT+ on contralateral global motion processing in comparison to sham stimulation, or in comparison to hf-tRNS to the forehead. While it remains possible that our lack of replication could be due to minor changes in the protocol from the original Ghin et al., study, for hf-tRNS to become a widely applied method, the modulatory effect of hf-tRNS should be robust to slight adjustments to the procedure.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

This phenomenon gives rise to many questions about the maintenance of sexual reproduction and the evolution of asexuality in these organisms. The poplar rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina has a complex life cycle, which is typical of rust fungi (Pucciniales). It alternates between a sexual reproduction phase on larch trees (Larix spp.) and rounds of asexual multiplication on poplar trees (Populus spp.). This study challenges the classic understanding of the M. larici-populina life cycle. We conducted a comprehensive population genetic analysis, utilizing 21 microsatellite markers and data from 2,122 individuals gathered over an extended time from various locations in France. Our results demonstrate the existence of many distinct lineages that reproduce asexually through the years, skipping the sexual phase. A clustering analysis identified a group of multilocus lineages that displayed all hallmarks of the genetic consequences of asexual reproduction, including highly negative and large variance among loci of the inbreeding coefficient (FIS). This indirect evidence for asexual reproduction was confirmed by the direct observation of these asexual lineages being repeatedly sampled over the years. While sexual lineages are predominant throughout France, asexual lineages are more prevalent in the south of the country, due to possible environmental or ecological factors that allow the overwintering of asexual forms. The discovery of variations in the life cycle in this species offers insights into the evolution from sexual to asexual reproduction encountered in many pathogen species.

The decline in effective population size (Ne) observed post-COVID-19 suggests recent bottlenecks, which may have further contributed to genetic drift and differentiation. While domesticated populations exhibited reduced genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding, wild-type population under short captivity retained higher heterozygosity. Genome-wide analyses further identified adaptive divergence among populations, with balancing selection and selective sweeps shaping genetic variation. Notably, despite shared ancestry, genetic differentiation persisted in selectively bred populations, reinforcing that selection and environmental pressures continue to influence their genomic landscape even after targeted selection was relaxed. These findings underscore the need to monitor genetic diversity in BSF breeding programs to maintain adaptability, enhance resilience, and mitigate risks from artificial selection and population collapse.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Among the Escherichia coli isolates, phylogroup B2 was most represented (53.7 %), followed by B1 (19.4 %), A (11.9 %), D (7.4 %), F (5.9 %) and C (1.4 %). Several (22/132, 16.6 %) isolates were multidrug-resistant, while almost half (62/132, 46.9 %) were extensively drug-resistant. Comparison of phenotypic data with genotypic data from three different AMR-profiling tools (ResFinder, CARD, AMRFinder) highlighted phenotype--genotype discordance as an important consideration in resistome studies in Egypt, with a total concordance of 91.1 %, 85.7 %, and 80.3 % for ResFinder, CARD and AMRFinder, respectively. Pseudomonas, at the species level, exhibited the greatest discordance. At the antimicrobial level, meropenem was subject to greatest discordance. In addition to the findings from our comparative analyses, new AMR variants are reported for Egypt for Pseudomonas (OXA-486, OXA-488, OXA-905, IMP-43, PDC-35, PDC-45, PDC-201) and Escherichia coli (TEM-176, TEM-190). In summary, we show that there is phenotype--genotype discordance in AMR profiling among CAUTI isolates, highlighting the need for comprehensive approaches in resistome studies.

For example, while watching a movie we use sensory information from every video frame to construct the current movie scene, which itself is continuously integrated into the narrative arc of the film. This critical function is supported by sensory inputs propagating from dynamic sensory cortices to association cortices, where neural activity remains more stable over time. The hierarchical organization of cortex is therefore reflected in a gradient of neural timescales. While this propagation of inputs up the cortical hierarchy is facilitated by both rhythmic (oscillatory) and non-rhythmic (aperiodic) neural activity, traditional measures of oscillations are often confounded by the influence of aperiodic signals. The reverse is also true: traditional measures of aperiodic neural timescales are influenced by oscillations. This makes it difficult to distinguish between oscillatory and timescale effects in cognition. Here, we analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data from participants performing a cognitive control task that manipulated the amount of task-relevant contextual information, called task abstraction. Critically, we separated aperiodic neural timescales from the confounding influence of oscillatory power. We hypothesized that neural timescales would increase during the task, and more so in high-abstraction conditions. We found that task abstraction dilated the aperiodic neural timescale, as estimated from the autocorrelation function, over prefrontal cortical regions. Our findings suggests that neural timescales are a dynamic feature of the cerebral cortex that change to meet task demands.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

M.; Keil, A.", "abstract": "The present study examined the contribution of the koniocellular retino-geniculate visual pathway to the electrocortical amplification of threat cues in human visual cortex using an aversive conditioning task. The task involved tritan stimuli, which are thought to convey visual information through S-cone signals that project to regions along the koniocellular pathway (tritan condition) and achromatic stimuli that preferentially activate luminance channels (luminance condition). Steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEPs) responses to the conditioned threat (CS+) and safety cues (CS-) in each condition were analyzed using a non-parametric Bayesian bootstrapped approach. Results showed that the tritan and luminance conditions exhibited greater ssVEP responses to the CS+ compared to the CS- stimuli in occipital sensors early into the trial (0 ms - 1000 ms; logBF10 > 2, decisive support). In addition to these early conditioning effects, a late conditioning effect was observed (1500 ms - 2500 ms) in the tritan condition that emerged in bilateral anterior sensors (logBF10 > 2). To further examine the tritan contribution to aversive learning, transitive Bayes factors were computed to compare the magnitude of the conditioning effects across conditions. Transitive Bayes factors showed that the early conditioning effect was larger in the luminance condition compared to the tritan condition (logBF10 > 2). Furthermore, the late conditioning effect remained larger in the tritan condition compared to the luminance condition (logBF10 > 2).

When applied to vertebrates, our ML model has identified specific conserved features with important evolutionary implications for miRNA biogenesis. Our findings indicate that miRNA strand preference is widespread but varies dynamically, with a subset of miRNAs switching strand usage depending on developmental stage or tissue types.

To overcome this, we introduce the Expression Graph Network Framework (EGNF), a cutting-edge graph-based approach that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with network-based feature engineering to enhance predictive biomarker identification. EGNF constructs biologically informed networks by combining gene expression data and clinical attributes within a graph database, utilizing hierarchical clustering to generate dynamic, patient-specific representations of molecular interactions. Leveraging graph learning techniques, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), our framework identifies statistically significant and biologically relevant gene modules for classification. Validated across three independent datasets consisting of contrasting tumor types and clinical scenarios, EGNF consistently outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving superior classification accuracy and interpretability. Notably, it delivers perfect separation between normal and tumor samples while excelling in nuanced tasks such as classifying disease progression and treatment outcome.

Proteins are treated as smooth Riemannian manifolds; each residue is equipped with a localized fiber whose environment vector encodes geometric and physico-chemical features. Motivated by Density Functional Theory, which links global electron density to reactivity, we hypothesize that a sufficiently rich local-density stencil captures the same information at the residue scale. On this foundation we build a single-file Python toolkit, reactive_site_predictor.py, which ranks candidate reactive residues in both metallo- and apo-proteins. The score combines (i) a geometry-based environment term, (ii) relativistic ZORA distance factors for metal centers, (iii) coordination-number and angle-deviation corrections, and (iv) an optional pocket-proximity flag. A fixed global random seed removes all stochastic elements, guaranteeing reproducibility. Benchmarks on three representative assemblies (Rubisco, GroEL, and SecA) achieve top-10 recall between 90% and 50% for documented functional residues. While promising, the current validation is limited to three static PDB structures; extension to dynamic ensembles and explicit quantum layers is left to future work. The framework thus offers an interpretable, physics-grounded, and deterministic paradigm for protein-function prediction. Beyond residue-level reactivity, the same manifold-fiber formalism is ultimately intended for purely geometric analysis of protein-protein interfaces: instead of assigning scalar scores, we construct an explicit contact sub-manifold and study its curvature, topology, and fiber-overlap signatures to deduce interaction logic without additional learning. Benchmarks on sixteen diverse protein assemblies (three originals plus thirteen new targets) show top-10 recall between 50% and 100%, underscoring the framework's generality. Across the full benchmark of sixteen proteins, the method recovers 134 literature-supported residues among 160 top-rank predictions, corresponding to a global top-10 precision of 0.84.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

However, available PSC models of mouse TRM development exhibit low overall efficiencies of TRM generation, produce heterogeneous off-target populations, and rely upon undefined media components, thus limiting their reproducibility, scalability, and widespread application as an experimental platform for TRM biology. To address these important limitations, we developed an efficient and reproducible protocol to faithfully recapitulate the stepwise differentiation of mouse PSCs (epiblast stem cells) into unspecialized, proliferative TRMs through the pro-definitive hematopoietic program under defined conditions. These immature TRMs can stably integrate into developing mouse neural organoids in vitro and acquire features of microglia.

Phage invasion activates retrons, triggering effector activity and inducing abortive infection and cell growth arrest. Ec78 distinguishes itself from other retrons by leveraging the Septu defense system, a stand-alone ATPase-nuclease pair (PtuAB), by reshaping its phage sensing and molecular assembly processes. To elucidate the evolutionary adaptation of PtuAB by Ec78, we determined electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) structures of Ec78 as well as the retron-displaced PtuAB at near atomic resolutions. We show that the Ec78-associated ATPase, PtuA, acquired unique elements that enable its interactions with the reverse transcriptase and the msDNA, as well as self-assembly when displaced by the retron. Supported by biochemical and mutational analysis, we also show that the retron-displaced PtuAB forms a tetramer, unlike its stand-alone counterpart, that indiscriminately restricts the host but, in the presence of the retron, confers a well-controlled immune response, eliciting ATP hydrolysis- and msDNA-regulated targeting to host tRNATyr.

Previously, we generated a model of AD using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which the AD risk variant of apolipoprotein E, APOE4, is pan-neuronally expressed. We showed that HSN class motor neurons degenerate in early adult stage animals. Here, we expand on our past work by performing behavioral analyses to deduce the effect of APOE4 on the function of distinct neuronal circuits. We found evidence that APOE4 induces dysfunction of other neurons; this spatiotemporal pattern of degeneration roughly correlates with endogenous levels of PTL-1, the C. elegans homolog of human MAPT also known as tau. Moreover, deletion of ptl-1 suppressed defects in multiple behaviors, suggesting broad protective effects across the nervous system including the HSN neurons. Lastly, we show that PTL-1 in the touch receptor neurons, where PTL-1 is most abundant, is required non-cell autonomously for degeneration of the HSN neurons. Our results suggest that C. elegans may provide a useful in vivo system to study how endogenous Tau acts downstream of APOE4 to cause progressive, patterned neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

This study investigates whether PBM can modulate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in 45 healthy young adults. We conducted forehead transcranial PBM (tPBM) and intranasal PBM (iPBM) at the nostril level, and measured CSF dynamics using blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI). Our data demonstrates 4 min of PBM-induced increases in CSF flow. Our data shows that (1) even a short PBM of 4 min can induce a change in CSF dynamics, in the form of an immediate increase in intracranial CSF volume and a reduction in CSF inflow; (2) skin melanin had a significant effect on the CSF response in tPBM, with lighter skin associated with higher responses; (3) both iPBM and tPBM displayed a dose-dependent effect on CSF dynamics in terms of a fluence-wavelength interaction; (4) intranasal PBM (iPBM) can be used to produce a significant change in CSF dynamics that is equivalent to forehead transcranial PBM (tPBM) with a small fraction of the fluence. The most likely explanation for the observed fMRI signal changes in CSF regions of interest for both tPBM and iPBM is an increased CSF outflow pressure due to PBM-induced vasodilation that transiently increases intracranial CSF volume and reduces net CSF inflow. This study establishes that PBM can modulate CSF flow in the healthy human brain in real time. This study also suggests that iPBM may be more efficient in CSF modulation due to the proximity to the olfactory system and the lack of melanin dependence. The influence of melanin on tPBM, the feasibility of iPBM and the dose dependence of both will require further investigation in healthy and patient populations.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is unique among its relatives for its ability to thrive at high temperature. The genetic determinants of the trait remain incompletely understood. We sought to understand the contribution of species variation in mitochondrial DNA to yeast thermotolerance. We used mitochondrial transgenesis to show that S. cerevisiae mitotypes were sufficient for a partial boost to thermotolerance and respiration in the S. paradoxus background. These mitochondrial alleles worked best when the background also harbored a pro-thermotolerance nuclear genotype, attesting to positive epistasis between the two genomes. The benefits of S. cerevisiae alleles in terms of respiration and growth at high temperature came at the cost of worse performance in cooler conditions. Together, our results establish this system as a case in which mitoalleles have fitness benefits and work well in multiple backgrounds; given the high mutation rate of the mitochondrial compartment, they were also likely extra easy for the ancestral population to acquire. We thus propose a broader model in which mitochondrial variants may prove to be especially good candidates in the search for genetic mechanisms of the adaptive process.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The fitness of a pathogen can be characterised at multiple levels corresponding to different stages of its life cycle, including replication within target cells (replicative capacity), immune evasion, and the capacity to infect new hosts (transmissibility). Pathogens evolve towards greater fitness within hosts, which can potentially compromise transmissibility. Typically, epidemiological studies for measuring pathogen fitness compute a single selection coefficient for pathogen variants that encompasses all stages of the pathogen life cycle. To address this problem, we develop a population-genetic model and software for the inference of multi-level selection coefficients which represent relative within-host fitness and transmissibility. Our approach builds on population genetic models previously applied to macro-evolution, whereby speciation and extinction rates are state-dependent. We relate the state-dependence in speciation and extinction rates to competing within- and between-host selection. Evolution of beneficial phenotypes within hosts may occur rapidly (higher 'speciation'), but reduce rates of dispersal between hosts (higher 'extinction'). This new coalescent-based method also accounts for highly nonlinear-population dynamics and variable sampling through time making it suitable for epidemiological studies. We derive the equilibrium proportion of a variant with multi-level selection under mutation-selection balance and show how this can be used in combination with the coalescent to greatly increase accuracy and precision of estimated selection coefficients. We characterise the accuracy of this method using a variety of birth-death and coalescent simulations before analysing a real dataset of HIV-1 genetic sequences from a large population-based sample of 4056 people living with HIV in Zambia. We quantified the multi-level relative fitness underlying HIV-1 'co-receptor switching'. In accordance with previous observations, we estimate that the relative transmissibility of X4-tropic virus is 9%, while within-host switching to X4-tropism is approximately seven-fold higher than switching to R5-tropism, indicating a strong within-host and between-host tradeoff of co-receptor usage.

Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these tod genes, unusual among Acinetobacter species, were likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that todF and todC1 are co-transcribed, while the adjacent fadL2 gene, encoding a putative outer membrane transporter corresponding to P. putida todX, is independently transcribed. Functional characterization using gene-knockout mutants revealed that TodC1, the large subunit of dioxygenase, is essential for growth on toluene, whereas FadL2 is not essential. Growth experiments further showed that the todC1 knockout mutant could metabolize benzoate, but not toluene or benzene, confirming that the TOD pathway is the primary route for toluene and benzene degradation in Tol 5.

Following a similar timeline, the inhibitory effect of PV+ interneurons emerges which start to functionally operate within the classical gamma frequency range from adolescence onwards.

To address this, we generated a chromosome-level assembly of the North American deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, meticulously annotating the complex olfactory subgenome. Comparative analysis revealed high evolutionary plasticity within chemosensory gene families. Rodent olfactory and vomeronasal sensory pathways, predominantly associated with odor learning and innate responses, respectively, show divergent evolutionary trajectories--one conserved, the other rapidly evolving. Despite overall vomeronasal gene dynamism, we identified receptors conserved across evolutionary timescales. Using the activation of these receptors as readouts, we demonstrate the conservation of receptor-ligand pairings for subsets of vomeronasal sensory neurons. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the evolution of the mammalian olfactory systems, highlighting key differences in receptor repertoires and establishing deer mice as a model clade to investigate neural mechanisms underlying the evolution of olfactory pathways and their impact on behavioral evolution.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

We analyzed transcriptomic data from mouse and human models of FOXP1 loss-of-function across prenatal and postnatal developmental stages, including neural stem cells from embryonic mice (E14.5) and human brain organoids (equivalent to second trimester), and cortical tissues from different mouse postnatal stages P0, P7, and P47. P0 in mice corresponds to the third trimester in humans, while P7 and P47 represent early childhood and adolescence, respectively. The effect of FOXP1 disruption on gene expression in cortical tissues/cells was assayed using RNA-seq, including time-course and pairwise gene expression analysis. Linkage disequilibrium score regression assessed if FOXP1-regulated genes were enriched for SCZ heritability. Gene-set enrichment analysis investigated if FOXP1-regulated genes were enriched for SCZ-associated genes reported as differentially expressed in single cortical cell studies. SynGO analysis mapped FOXP1-regulated genes to synaptic locations and functions. FOXP1-regulated genes are enriched for SCZ heritability, with significant results for E14.5, P7 and P47 but not P0. The P7 gene-set showed the strongest enrichment for SCZ-associated genes from single cortical cell studies. FOXP1-regulated genes at both P7 and P47 were involved in multiple synaptic functions and were mainly enriched within glutamatergic excitatory neurons, with P47 also showing enrichment within GABAergic inhibitory neurons across regions of the postnatal cortex. Prenatal FOXP1-regulated genes were enriched in progenitor cells and also mapped to the synapse. Genetic risk for SCZ within FOXP1-regulated genes follows a dynamic trajectory across developmental stages, showing stronger effects at timepoints that map to early childhood, followed by adolescence and second trimester.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

We previously identified a genetically linked and co-regulated gene pair in the aphid Myzus persicae encoding effectors Mp1 and Mp58. Here, we explored the functional link between these effectors. We used ectopic expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana followed by co-immunoprecipitation assays and confocal microscopy to explore effector-effector and effector-target interactions and their subcellular localisation. We produced recombinant proteins to validate effector interactions and used computational modelling to predict effector complex 3D structures. We revealed that effectors Mp1 and Mp58 interact in planta and in vitro and likely form an oligomeric complex. Both effectors associate with the host target Vacuolar Protein Sorting associated Protein 52 (VPS52) to form an Mp1-Mp58-VPS52 complex which localises at vesicle-like structures. Our findings point to effector complex formation in plant-insect interactions and highlight a further layer of complexity in the molecular dialogue between plants and insects.

However, the mechanisms suppressing chilling-induced PSI photoinhibition remain unclear. This study aimed to identify factors preventing PSI photoinhibition by comparing two cucumber cultivars with different susceptibilities to PSI photoinhibition and chilling stress tolerance. In the chilling-sensitive cultivar, partial degradation of the CF1-{gamma} subunit of chloroplast ATPase led to uncoupling of the thylakoid membrane. In addition, electron efflux from Fe-S clusters downstream of PSI was restricted under chilling stress, resulting in highly reduced Fe-S clusters. Notably, this PSI over-reduction in the chilling-sensitive cultivar was observed not only under chilling stress but also under fluctuating light conditions, limited CO2 conditions, and during the transition from darkness to light, suggesting that cyclic electron flow contributes to cultivar differences in PSI photoinhibition. Indeed, the chilling-tolerant cultivar exhibited higher activity of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) and suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during the early stages of chilling stress. In contrast, in the chilling-sensitive cultivar, destabilization of PSI-NDH supercomplex under chilling stress led to the loss of NDH activity, resulting in severe PSI over-reduction. This study provides evidence that NDH acts as a crucial electron sink to prevent PSI photoinhibition and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying low-temperature stress tolerance.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

MSI can identify secretion and retention patterns for microbial metabolites, allowing for the assessment of chemical communication within complex microbial communities. Microbial imaging via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI remains challenging due to high sample complexity and heterogeneity associated with the required sample preparation, making annotation of molecules by MS1 alone challenging. The implementation of trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) has increased the dimensionality of MALDI-MSI experiments, allowing for the resolution of isomers and isobars, and can increase sensitivity of metabolite detection within complex samples.

Dysregulation can lead to accelerated development of the diseases of aging and the aging process itself. Here, we identify a novel enzymatic activity of the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT4 as a lysine deitaconylase that regulates macrophage inflammatory responses. Itaconate is a metabolite abundantly produced in activated macrophages. We find it forms a protein modification called lysine itaconylation. Using biochemical and proteomics approaches, we demonstrate that SIRT4 efficiently removes this modification from target proteins both in vitro and in vivo. In macrophages, elevated protein itaconylation increases upon LPS stimulation, coinciding with elevated SIRT4 expression. SIRT4-deficient macrophages exhibit significantly increased IL-1{beta} production in response to LPS stimulation. This phenotype is intrinsic to macrophages, as demonstrated by both lentiviral over-expression and acute SIRT4 knockdown models. Mechanistically, we identify key enzymes in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism as targets of hyperitaconylation in SIRT4-deficient macrophages. The BCKDH complex component dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2 (DBT) is hyperitaconylated and has reduced BCKDH activity in SIRT4KO macrophages. Physiologically, SIRT4-deficient mice exhibit significantly delayed wound healing, demonstrating a consequence of dysregulated macrophage function.

We evaluated the role of LOXL2 in TMJ cartilage, its molecular mechanism and gene networks using in vivo Loxl2 knockout mice (Acan-Cre; Loxl2flox/flox) and ex vivo goat TMJ cartilage. Our results show that Loxl2 knockout in mice cartilage upregulates Il1b, Mmp9, Mmp13, Adamts4, and Adamts5, whereas it reduces the levels of aggrecan and proteoglycan. Loxl2 deleted TMJ cartilage show a higher enrichment of inflammatory response, TNFA signaling via NF-kB, extracellular matrix (ECM), and collagen degradation pathway network. Conversely, LOXL2 treatment reduces interleukin-1 beta (IL-1{beta})-induced expression of Mmp13, protects mitochondrial function and ECM from degeneration. Importantly, LOXL2 attenuates IL-1{beta}-induced chondrocyte apoptosis via phosphorylation of NF-{kappa}B and expression of pain-related gene PTGS2 (encodes COX2).

Here, we introduce a modular recombinant protein platform for rapidly measuring the binding affinity of inducible amphipathic helices towards a variety of membrane compositions and curvatures using high-throughput fluorescence anisotropy measurements. Inducible amphipathic helices are solubilized with a fluorescently tagged small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein and binding to membranes quantified by leveraging the unexpected decrease in fluorescence anisotropy upon binding, a phenomenon previously observed but not well understood. By using fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements and solution NMR experiments, we deduce that this phenomenon likely occurs due to the local increase in fluorophore motion upon binding to the membrane.

Studying novel missense mutations in this channel has the potential to uncover unrealised functions of critical residues that could enable new strategies for analgesia. Here we describe detailed functional studies of six SCN9A missense variants found in individuals with typical SCN9A-CIP: c.224T>C/p.Leu75Pro, c.1025C>T/p.Thr342Met, c.2686C>T/p.Arg896Trp, c.2732G>A/p.Arg911His, c.5059G>C/p.Ala1687Pro, and c.5173G>C/p.Gly1725Arg. While all variants were extremely rare and predicted to alter function, current tools cannot specify the extent or direction of change in function, nor provide information about the mechanism(s) of pathogenicity. Stable cell lines were generated for each variant, using the isogenic Jump-In T-REx HEK293 system.

Our studies revealed that all mutations reached the cell membrane but caused a complete LOF through small localised structural changes in the extracellular vestibule, ion selectivity filter and N-terminus that abolished sodium conductance.

Valproic acid (VPA), a classic histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, has shown promise both on its own and in combination with other drugs as a therapeutic agent against various solid tumors, including gliomas. Given reported effects of VPA on chromatin supraorganization and expression activity in several cell types, we studied textural features that may indicate changes in chromatin structure in U-251MG glioblastoma cells cultured in the presence of VPA, utilizing image cytometry. For comparison, cells treated with 5-aza-CdR served as a positive control for DNA demethylation. Chromatin remodeling was observed in VPA-treated cells, which displayed decreased HDAC activity and increased histone H3 acetylation, whereas no such changes were detected in 5-aza-CdR-treated cells.

Through cell-free reconstitutions, we have found that the apposition of donor and acceptor membranes is important for the assembly of the outer layer of the COPII coat (Sec13/31) but had minimal impact on Sar1-induced COPII inner layer (Sec23/24) recruitment. The expression of the adaptor protein p125A, which binds to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), Sec31 and Sec23, stabilized the contact between the donor and acceptor membranes and promoted COPII outer layer assembly. A p125A-chimera expressing a Golgi-targeted PI4P-binding domain could also support outer layer assembly. Notably, the C-terminal helical domain of Sec31A, which interacts with p125A, was essential for its assembly at ERES. In cells lacking p125A, the assembly of the COPII outer layer was selectively destabilized. Transcriptome and secretome analyses reveal selective adjustments to extracellular matrix remodeling and collagen secretion, which corresponded with selective inhibition of fibrillar collagen traffic from the ER.

Using Drosophila oogenesis as a model, we previously discovered the LD-associated Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL) promotes actin remodeling necessary for oocyte development by providing the substrate for producing lipid signals termed prostaglandins (PGs). Here we find that Jabba, a LD-associated protein best known for its role in anchoring other proteins to LDs, also promotes PG-dependent actin remodeling. Overexpression of Jabba results in thickened cortical actin and excessive actin bundles, whereas loss of Jabba results in cortical actin breakdown and severely defective actin bundle formation. We find that Jabba regulates actin remodeling independently of ATGL but in conjunction with PG signaling. These data support that there are two PG signaling pathways that promote actin remodeling: one PG pathway that is dependent on ATGL and the other requires Jabba. Overexpression of Jabba rescues the actin defects when PG signaling is lost. Together these data lead to the model that PGs produced independently of ATGL positively regulate Jabba to promote actin remodeling necessary for follicle morphogenesis and the production of a fertilization competent oocyte.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Standard proteomics techniques require cell lysis and so are unable to characterize changes specific to the critical sub-cellular domain bounded by the T-tubule and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, known as the cardiac dyad. Traditional approaches are also less likely to capture low-affinity protein-protein interactions on lipid membranes. To improve our understanding of heart failure pathophysiology, we applied proximity proteomics to the cardiac dyad of mice with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Methods: Using two lines of transgenic mice expressing fusion proteins of the engineered ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 with subunits of the cardiac voltage gated calcium channel, CaV1.2, we labeled the dyad proteome of live, intact myocytes from healthy mice (N=6) and mice with coronary artery ligation HF (N=5) by peroxidase-catalyzed biotinylation. Quantitative mass spectrometry with isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT) was used to assess alterations in the local dyad proteome in myocytes from mice with chronic, remodeled HF. We subsequently generated a mouse with inducible cardiac overexpression of Galectin-1 to examine the effects of this protein on cardiac function and more specifically on the calcium-handling properties of mature myocytes, using cellular electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography. Results: From mice with HF, we found significant enrichment of 43 proteins defined by their abundance and proximity to transgenic CaV1.2 Alpha-1C channels, and a significant reduction in 22 proteins, out a of a total of 2326 proteins quantified. We also significantly enriched 286 proteins, and saw a reduction in 13 proteins, defined by proximity and abundance to CaV1.2 Beta-2B-subunits, out of a total 2236 proteins identified. Pathway analysis revealed HF is associated with increased abundance of components of the 26s proteasome and microtubules in the dyad, as well as the dimerizing, carbohydrate binding protein Galectin-1. Cardiac specific overexpression of Galectin-1 in healthy mice increases activation of CaV1.2 and the Ryanodine receptor and accelerates myocyte relaxation through phosphorylation of Phospholamban. Conclusions: Using proximity proteomics to examine the effects of HF in vivo, we find increased localization of Galectin-1 to the cardiac dyad, and that overexpression of Galectin-1 accelerates calcium kinetics in the heart.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

In contrast to mice, where degradative activity increases during oocyte maturation, human oocytes exhibit nearly 2-fold lower degradative activity than surrounding somatic cells, which decreases further as oocytes mature.

Endothelial cells (ECs) downstream of atherosclerotic plaques for instance are exposed to turbulent flow, activating inflammatory pathways that promote immune cell infiltration. In conditions like stroke and myocardial infarction, the abrupt loss of blood flow prompts responses in vascular cells such as ECs and pericytes (PCs) to adapt to ischemic or no-flow conditions. To better understand how cerebral capillary ECs and PCs react to the sudden loss of blood flow, we used a murine brain slice model cultured for 12- and 24-hours in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) with 95% oxygen supplementation. As expected, inflammation mediators were upregulated in cultured slices compared to non-cultured samples, particularly those associated with leukocyte recruitment. Additionally, transcriptional markers of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and cell-ECM interactions were elevated, consistent with reduced PC coverage along capillaries. We initially presumed these changes reflected blood-brain barrier (BBB) degradation, but instead we found an increase in mRNA transcripts for EC junctions and stable protein levels for junction molecules, with an apparent rearrangement of Claudin5-based tight junctions. Some capillaries also exhibited reduced diameters, suggesting constriction by PCs or a subset thereof. Consistent with these observations, we found an upregulation of the vasoconstrictor Endothelin-1 (ET-1) with its receptors and contractile proteins found in a subpopulation of PCs. Suppressing ET-1 activity prevented Claudin5 upregulation, indicating that ET-1 might regulate microvascular constriction and associated changes in endothelial tight junctions. Overall, these results suggest that in the absence of blood flow, PCs contribute to capillary wall remodeling by (i) potentially mediating a mechanism driven by ET-1 that affects EC Claudin5 dynamics, and (ii) reducing capillary ECM and detaching from microvessel walls.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that Tet1 safeguards ISC fate decisions by reducing sensitivity to extrinsic signaling. Inducible, intestine-specific Tet1 knockout mice (Tet1iKO) exhibit environmentally sensitive phenotypes, including absorptive differentiation bias and premature expression of mature absorptive transcripts in ISCs. These phenotypes are largely silenced in animals housed in a high-level barrier facility, where Tet1iKO epithelium closely resembles controls. Despite the lack of baseline phenotype in these conditions, Tet1iKO mice retain increased sensitivity to pro-differentiation signaling. In vivo, succinate administration induces increased tuft and goblet cell hyperplasia in the absence of Tet1, while Tet1iKO organoids cultured with IL-4 or DAPT exhibit increased tuft and enteroendocrine cell specification, respectively. While ATAC-seq of Tet1iKO ISCs reveals minimal changes in chromatin accessibility, footprinting analysis suggests increased binding of lineage-specific TFs and CTCF even in the absence of cellular phenotypes. Together, our data demonstrate that Tet1 serves as a buffer against ISC differentiation and suggest that it does so in a lineage agnostic manner that is not dependent on changes in chromatin accessibility.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

These metabolites have varied mechanisms in interacting with the host, of which one such mode is decorating the chromatin landscape. We previously detected specific histone modifications in the mouse gut that can be derived from SCFAs and are regulated by the microbiota. However, the roles of these SCFAs on chromatin and how they impact gene regulation in human cells is largely unknown. Now, our studies demonstrate these microbiota-dependent histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are associated with alterations in gene regulation in human cells. We show that histone butyrylation on H3K27 is detected in human colon samples. Furthermore, histone acetylation, butyrylation, and propionylation on H3K9 and H3K27 are responsive to levels of SCFAs in human colon cancer cell lines and are associated with active gene regulatory elements. In addition, treatment of human cancer cell lines with individual metabolites or combinations of SCFAs replicating the intestinal lumen environment result in distinct and overlapping gene program changes, with butyrate largely driving gene regulatory effects of SCFA combinations. Lastly, we define butyrate effects on gene expression that are independent of HDAC inhibition and are dependent on p300/CBP, suggesting potential gene programs regulated by histone butyrylation. Together, these results demonstrate that SCFAs are key regulators of the chromatin landscape and gene programs in human colorectal cancer cells.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

While DNA replication in MKs (endomitosis) is well studied, limited investigations have examined the impact of DNA damage and repair inhibition on megakaryopoiesis. To explore PARP inhibitor-induced thrombocytopenia, we treated mice with PARP inhibitors (niraparib and olaparib), which are approved for the treatment of solid tumors. While high-dose niraparib treatment led to thrombocytopenia, consistent with clinical observations, treatment at a lower dosage led to a significant, >1.5-fold increase in both the number of bone marrow MKs and circulating platelets. This increase was accompanied by elevated DNA damage in both MKs and MK progenitors, as measured by both yH2AX accumulation and comet assays of MKs. Notably, platelets from niraparib-treated mice were functionally normal in their response to ADP, TRAP, and collagen. Gamma-irradiation treatment similarly increased MK and platelet counts in mice, suggesting that moderate DNA damage enhances megakaryopoiesis and increases platelet counts.

Standardized conditions are required to ensure a high degree of inter- and intra-laboratory reproducibility when performing these assays. A significant issue that hinders the utility of seed amplification assays is the de novo aggregation propensity of the -synuclein substrate as well as inter-batch heterogeneity. While much work has focused on determining appropriate seed amplification assay buffer compositions as well as the type and amount of seed used, a robust comparison of -synuclein substrate purification methods has not been reported. We therefore compared the utility of recombinant -synuclein purified using four different methods as seed amplification assay substrates across two laboratories. Osmotic shock-purified -synuclein monomer substrate showed the lowest propensity for de novo aggregation, which translated into being the best substrate for seed amplification assay reactions seeded with -synuclein preformed fibrils or patient brain homogenates. Furthermore, osmotic shock -synuclein monomer showed the best inter-batch reproducibility compared to all other substrates tested. As -synuclein seed amplification assays continue to evolve and move towards adoption in the clinical realm, this work showcases the vital importance of standardizing the production and characterization of recombinant -synuclein substrate.

They play important roles in intercellular communication and contribute to several physiological and pathological processes. Cells release subpopulations of EVs with distinct biogenesis and functions, however, we currently have few markers to differentiate them. This study, therefore, aimed to determine proteomic and lipidomic differences among four EV subpopulations of varying sizes and densities. Methods: Large and small EVs (L-EVs and S-EVs) were isolated from two immune cell lines by differential ultracentrifugation at 16,500 x g and 118,000 x g, respectively. The crude EVs were then further separated by density cushion centrifugation. EVs were isolated from the interphase between 1.079-1.146 and 1.146-1.185 g/ml, hereafter referred to as low density (LD) and high density (HD), respectively. This resulted in four subpopulations of EVs: L-EVs LD, L-EVs HD, S-EVs LD, and S-EVs HD. The morphology, size, and yield of EVs were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, and western blot. The proteome and lipidome of the four subpopulations of EVs were determined with mass spectrometry. Results: A total of 5364 proteins were quantified in the dataset. L-EV and S-EVs as well as LD and HD were well separated. Briefly, L-EVs LD were enriched in mitochondrial proteins such as the TIMM/TOMM complex, MICOS, and ATP5 proteins. In contrast, L-EVs HD were enriched in proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, such as KIF proteins. Furthermore, S-EVs LD were enriched in tetraspanins and ESCRT machinery proteins, while S-EVs HD were enriched in histones, CCT proteins, and proteins from the complement pathway. Proteins such as flotillins, RABs, annexins, and integrins were enriched in two or several subpopulations. Furthermore, 107 lipids were quantified, and the most abundant lipids in EVs were phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The most profound difference was that PE was less abundant in L-EVs LD as compared to the other EV subtypes, and ceramides were enriched in L-EVs as compared to S-EVs. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the proteome and lipidome differ in EV subpopulations separated based on size and density. Furthermore, it validates several protein groups that have previously been suggested to be enriched in either S-EVs or L-EVs.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a clinical case of Nakaseomyces glabratus (Candida glabrata) in which combined mutations in ERG3 and FKS2, but not FKS2 alone, appear to confer echinocandin resistance. Integrated analyses reveal a recurrent association between Erg3 loss-of-function and echinocandin resistance mediated by Fks variation across Candida species, but exclude ERG3 loss-of-function as an independent resistance mechanism. Advances in Fks structural biology and insights into echinocandin-Fks interactions support a model of epistatic crosstalk between membrane sterols and Fks function.

N-Myc downstream-regulated genes (NDRGs) have recently emerged as stress-responsive proteins with roles in protein trafficking, but their functions during normal embryogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we identify N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1b (Ndrg1b) as a novel regulator of N-cadherin (N-cad, cdh2) trafficking during zebrafish muscle development. We show that ndrg1b is broadly expressed during embryonic and larval stages and is required for proper skeletal muscle morphogenesis. Loss of Ndrg1b disrupts N-cad localization and impairs cell adhesion in vitro, highlighting a key role in maintaining tissue integrity. Mechanistically, Ndrg1b promotes the recycling of N-cad to the plasma membrane, identifying it as a novel component of the endocytic trafficking machinery in vivo. Given the central role of N-cad in development and disease, these findings provide new insight into how its localization is fine-tuned during morphogenesis. This work also expands the functional repertoire of NDRGs beyond stress response, suggesting that Ndrg1b - and potentially other NDRG family members - may broadly regulate transmembrane protein trafficking in a context-dependent manner.

In this study, we investigated the impact of SF3B1 phosphorylation on cell cycle-dependent splicing, with a particular focus on the checkpoint regulators ARPP19 and ENSA, two functionally related proteins that modulate PP2A-B55 activity during mitotic progression. Using RNA-seq analysis, we identified a subset of SF3B1-regulated splicing events that are enriched in cell cycle genes. We demonstrated that SF3B1 phosphorylation during G2/M promotes the ARPP19-long isoform, a variant associated with poor survival in AML patients and accelerated mitotic exit.

We hypothesized that caloric restriction would worsen bone quality in obese mice by shifting the cortical bone metabolome. To induce obesity, 8-week-old male and female C57BL6/J mice received 60% high-fat diet for 12 weeks. From 20 to 30 weeks of age, mice either remained obese or lost weight through 30% caloric restriction. Control animals received a 10% low-fat diet. Bodyweight and fat mass were increased by obesity and decreased with calorie restriction. Similarly, glucose and insulin tolerance were worsened with obesity but improved by weight loss. Compared to obesity, calorie restriction elicited more bone loss in both cortical and trabecular compartments. Weight loss also reduced bone formation. Both obesity and subsequent calorie restriction altered the cortical bone metabolome in a sex-dependent manner. Metabolic pathways altered with diet generally mapped to amino acid or fatty acid metabolism. In males, weight loss was associated with a downregulation of pathways related to tryptophan, tyrosine, ubiquinone, and fatty acids. In females, calorie restriction downregulated taurine and hypotaurine metabolism but upregulated pyrimidine metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis.

Yet, little is known of whether cells weaponize mitochondrial metabolism during infection. We found that the transcription factor ATF4 activated a mitochondrial metabolic defense based on the essential B vitamin folate. During infection with the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii, ATF4 increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels by driving the one-carbon (1C) metabolism processes that occur in mitochondria and use folate. The activation of ATF4 depended on host detection of parasite effector proteins, and restricted parasite growth by limiting its access to folate(s) required for dTMP synthesis. Impairing host mitochondrial 1C metabolism downstream of ATF4 promoted parasite growth, while forcing host dependence on mitochondrial 1C metabolism had the opposite effect. ATF4 activation also promoted a host-protective response in a mouse model of Toxoplasma infection. Thus, ATF4 rewires mitochondrial metabolism to activate a folate-based metabolic immunity against Toxoplasma.

However, it is unclear which Ca2+ dependent repair mechanism(s) resists candidalysin. Here, we determined the involvement of different Ca2+ dependent repair mechanisms to candidalysin and compared responses to CDCs and aerolysin using flow cytometry and high-resolution microscopy. We report that candidalysin triggered Ca2+-dependent repair, but patch repair and ceramide failed to provide significant protection. MEK-dependent repair and annexins A1, A2 and A6 contributed partially to repairing damage caused by candidalysin. However, annexin translocation after candidalysin challenge was delayed compared to CDCs or aerolysin challenge. Surprisingly, extracellular Cl- improved cell survival after candidalysin challenge, but not after challenge with a CDC or aerolysin.

Mammalian genomes comprise 4 VPS13 genes encoding proteins with distinct localizations and function. The gene duplication resulting in VPS13A and VPS13C is the most recent in evolution and, accordingly, these two proteins are the most similar to each other. However, they have distinct subcellular localizations and their loss of function mutations in humans are compatible with life but result in two different age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, chorea-acanthocytosis and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Thus, it remains unclear whether these two proteins have overlapping functions. Here, we show that while Vps13a KO and Vps13c KO mice are viable, embryonic development of Vps13a/Vps13c double knockout (DKO) mice is arrested at midgestation. Prior to death, DKO embryos were smaller than controls, were anemic and had a smaller liver, the key erythropoietic site at this developmental stage. Further analyses of erythroid precursor cells showed that their differentiation was impaired and that this defect was accompanied by activation of innate immunity as revealed by upregulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally, the RIG-I and MDA5 components of dsRNA triggered innate immunity were found upregulated in the DKO fetal liver. Activation of innate immunity may result from loss of integrity of the membranes of intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria and autophagic lysosomes, due to the absence of these lipid transport proteins. The surprising and striking synthetic effect resulting for the combined loss of VPS13A and VPS13C suggests that despite of the different localization of these two proteins, the lipid fluxes that they mediate are partially redundant.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Domoic acid (DA), the neurotoxin causing Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP), is particularly persistent in king scallops (Pecten maximus), a commercially valuable species in France. This species is known for its slow depuration rate compared to other species. As a result, anticipating DA dynamics is therefore a key to managing fishery openings in autumn, especially following spring contamination events. This study used 20 years of data from the French phycotoxin in-situ monitoring programme (REPHYTOX) to identify contamination events along the French Atlantic and English Channel coastlines. Depuration rates were estimated for 104 events; however, no correlation was found between depuration rate and province, time period, initial DA concentration or environmental conditions. Consequently, a median depuration rate was defined and applied in a widely used exponential decay model. In response to professionals' needs, we developed a user-friendly predictive tool that estimates DA concentrations in king scallops based on sampling in spring or summer. We recommend performing DA quantification in scallops whenever DA is detected in other shellfish at the same location, and running the predictive model to anticipate DA content at the opening of the fishery season in autumn. This tool will help fishery managers to anticipate bans, to avoid unnecessary licence purchases, or to shift to alternative species.

For ALB and TBRFV, DTDS surveys reduced sample sizes and durations by 77 percent or more. For P. citricarpa, the DTDS design greatly increased the sample area, but eliminated 6% (scenario 1) and 68% (scenario 2) failure rates in the original plan.

Using generalized models, we derive conditions for the onset of different dynamical behaviors in communities of bacterial cooperators across these scenarios. These include exchanges of low-cost metabolites, costly cross-feeding, and cases where bacteria produce either most or only a small fraction of available metabolites. Stability depends strongly on metabolic production costs and the balance between metabolite uptake and production.

However, the intricate interactions of these organisms and environmental variability require the use of complex models such as machine learning methods. In this study, we compared three methods for producing habitat maps of anchovies: the traditional Generalised Additive Models, the XGBoost which is a form of supervised machine learning and a new method based on clustering water types as a form of unsupervised machine learning. We optimised the three methods with a parameter grid search algorithm and compared their capability to replicate the mean state of anchovies by comparing them with presence-absence observations along the Peruvian coastline between 1990 and 2010. We used the output of a physical-biogeochemical model as input for the habitat models to produce distribution maps of anchovy. All models successfully simulated the distribution of anchovies along the Peruvian coastline in normal years and a reduced area of distribution with most of the anchovies in the southern part of the domain during the canonical El Nino 97/98. We then applied the models to predict potential changes in the distribution of anchovies under projected temperature and wind conditions by the end of the century. We observed a reduction in the probability of anchovy occurrence under conditions of higher temperature and weaker winds. Two of the three habitat models predicted a severe maximum decline by 90% (GAM) and 75% (XGBoost) whereby the clustering model predicted a moderate maximum decline in anchovy occurrence by 20%.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Each toxin has two parts: a conserved N-terminal region used for protein translocation and delivery; and a hypervariable C-terminal tip that carries the toxic domain. Directly downstream of the Rhs toxin is a cognate immunity protein that protects the producing cell from autoinhibition. Rhs toxin ubiquity and diversity across bacterial genera suggest they play an essential role in bacterial fitness and niche exclusion. However, little is known about Rhs toxin abundance, diversity, and function within and among bacterial plant pathogens with different life histories. Here, we used a profile Hidden Markov Model to systematically mine publicly available genomes from four agriculturally significant plant-pathogenic bacterial genera: Xanthomonas, Ralstonia, Pectobacterium, and Dickeya. This approach identified 604, 294, 255, and 113 Rhs toxin homologs, respectively, from 165, 87, 60, and 31 genomes. N-terminal sequence analysis classified these homologs into distinct families, including two lineage-specific groups--one exclusive to Xanthomonas and another to Ralstonia--both unexpectedly linked to the type II secretion system instead of the canonical type VI secretion system. Sequence similarity network analysis of the C-terminal tip domains revealed conserved and lineage-specific toxin variants highlighting substantial diversification of Rhs C-terminal tips across taxonomic levels. Xanthomonads harbored the most extensive and diverse repertoire of predicted toxic domains, including DNases, RNases, proteases, and deaminases. Notably, the expected function of 69.64% of the C-terminal tip sequences across all genera remains unknown. Contrary to our hypothesis, our findings suggest that foliar pathogens encode more diverse Rhs toxin repertoires than their soilborne counterparts. However, only comprehensive functional analyses can provide a framework for understanding how these pathogens use Rhs toxins to establish themselves within agricultural ecosystems.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify and validate a single amino acid substitution (P55Q) in the ribosomal protein RPL-36A of Caenorhabditis elegans that confers complete resistance to high concentrations of the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). Heterozygous animals carrying both wild-type RPL-36A and RPL-36A(P55Q) exhibit normal development but intermediate CHX resistance, indicating a partial dominant effect. Leveraging RPL-36A(P55Q) as a single-copy positive selection marker for CRISPR-based genome editing, we introduced targeted modifications into multiple ribosomal protein genes, confirming its broad utility for altering essential loci. In L4-stage heterozygotes, where CHX-sensitive and CHX-resistant ribosomes coexist, ribosome profiling revealed increased start-codon occupancy, suggesting early stalling of CHX sensitive ribosomes. Chronic CHX reduced ribosome collisions, evidenced by fewer disomes and unchanged codon distributions in monosomes. Surprisingly, prolonged elongation inhibition did not activate well characterized stress pathways--including ribosome quality control (RQC), the ribotoxic stress response (RSR), or the integrated stress response (ISR)--as indicated by absence of changes in RPS-10 ubiquitination, eIF2 phosphorylation, PMK-1 phosphorylation, or the transcriptional upregulation of ATF-4 target genes. Instead, RNA-normalized ribosome footprints revealed gene-specific changes in translation efficiency, with nucleolar and P granule components significantly decreased while oocyte development genes were increased. Consistent with these observations, we detected premature oogenesis in L4 animals, suggesting that partial translation elongation inhibition reshapes translation efficiency, to fine-tune developmental timing.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "During origin licensing, the origin recognition complex (ORC) loads two Mcm2-7 helicases onto DNA in a head-to-head conformation, establishing the foundation for subsequent bidirectional replication. Single-molecule experiments support a helicase-loading model in which one ORC loads both Mcm2-7 helicases at origins. For this to occur, ORC must release from its initial Mcm2-7 and DNA binding sites, flip over the helicase, and bind the opposite end of the Mcm2-7 complex and adjacent DNA to form the MO complex. Importantly, this binding-site transition occurs without ORC releasing into solution. Using a single-molecule FRET assay, we show that the N-terminal half of Orc6 tethers ORC to the N-terminal tier of Mcm2-7 (Mcm2-7N) during ORC's binding-site transition. This interaction involves both the folded Orc6 N-terminal domain (Orc6N) and the adjacent unstructured linker and forms before ORC releases from its initial Mcm2-7 interaction. The absence of this interaction increases the rate of ORC release into solution, consistent with a tethering function. CDK phosphorylation of ORC inhibits the tethering interaction, providing a mechanism for the known CDK inhibition of MO complex formation. Interestingly, we identify mutations in the Orc6 linker region that support MO complex formation but prevent double-hexamer formation by inhibiting stable second Mcm2-7 recruitment.

Auditory cortical neurons started responding to tonal stimuli by P13-14 with an initial tonotopic organization that expanded over the next few days. We documented the daily variation in tuning curves and best frequency, and while some neurons gradually changed their frequency representation across days, altogether our findings support the functional maturation of a largely stable auditory map at the population level. We then compared the representation of mouse pup ultrasonic vocalizations to pure tone responses. Ultrasonic pure tone tuning developed with a delay, coinciding with emerging responses to ultrasonic vocalizations.

However, it is not clear if individual differences in fear responses exist and, if so, what parts of the brain may underlie such differences. To probe these questions, we developed a contextual fear conditioning paradigm for zebrafish that uses conspecific alarm substance (CAS) as an unconditioned stimulus where fish associate CAS administration with a specific tank. To identify individual differences, we collected behavioral responses from over 300 fish from four different strains (AB, TU, TL, and WIK) and both sexes. We found that fear memory behavior fell into four distinct groups: non-reactive, evaders, evading freezers, and freezers. We also found that background strain and sex influenced how fish respond to CAS, with males more likely to increase evasive behaviors than females and the TU strain more likely to be non-reactive. Finally, we performed whole-brain activity mapping to identify the brain regions that are associated with different behavioral responses. All groups exposed to the tank had strong engagement of the telencephalon, whereas regions beyond the telencephalon distinguished behavioral groups: animals that have high levels of freezing, but low levels of evasion, uniquely engage the cerebellum, preglomerular nuclei, and pretectal areas, whereas those fish that mix evasion with freezing engage the preoptic and hypothalamic areas.

Methods: A prospective cross-over study was conducted in children with RE and control. Children completed two nap visits with auditory or sham stimulation. SOs and SO-spindle complexes rates were measured offline using validated detectors. Sleep-dependent memory consolidation was assessed using the motor sequence typing task. Results: Auditory stimulation evoked SOs and SO-spindle complexes broadly with maximal effect over frontal electrodes. Compared to sham, stimulation delivered during background activity evoked SOs (29.8% increase, p<0.001) and SO-spindle complexes (16.8% increase, p<0.001) and stimulations delivered near the peak of an ongoing SO upstate maximally evoked SOs (51.3% increase, p<0.001) and SO-spindle complexes (32.3% increase, p<0.001). Changes in frontal SO (1.9% improvement per increase in SO/min; p<0.001) and SO-spindle complexes (9.5% improvement per increase in SO-spindle/min) event rates due to auditory stimulation positively predicted changes in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Conclusion: Auditory stimulation reliably modulates sleep oscillations when delivered on background activity and during the upstate of SOs. As increased event rates improve memory consolidation, stimulation paradigms to increase SO and SO-spindle complex rates are required to enhance memory.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

To date, however, no studies have provided evidence that eDNA methods can achieve detection densities on par with traditional pollinator surveys. Using a large-scale dataset of eDNA and corresponding net surveys, we show that eDNA methods enable sensitive, species-level characterization of whole bumble bee communities, including rare and critically endangered species such as the rusty pathed bumble bee (RPBB; Bombus affinis). All species present in netting surveys were detected within eDNA surveys, apart from two rare species in the socially parasitic subgenus Psithyrus (cuckoo bumble bees). Further, for rare non-parasitic species, eDNA methods exhibited similar sensitivity relative to traditional netting. Relative to flower eDNA samples, sequenced field negative controls resulted in significantly lower rates of Bombus detection, and these detections were likely attributable to high rates of background eDNA on environmental surfaces. Lastly, we found that eDNA-based frequency of detection across replicate surveys was strongly associated with net-based measures of abundance across site visits. We conclude that the method is cost-effective and highly scalable for semi-quantitative characterization of at-risk bumble bee communities, providing a new approach for improving our understanding of species habitat associations.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

We resolve this paradox by demonstrating that cercariae utilize a physics-based strategy: they actively accumulate at the air-water interface, transforming inefficient three-dimensional search into effective two-dimensional exploration, increasing host-encounter efficiency by a thousand fold. Our biophysical models demonstrate that this behavior emerges from weight-asymmetric morphology, enabling an embodied algorithm for surface-seeking swimming modes without complex neural control. Surface-swimming cercariae benefit from near-zero vertical flows near the surface, allowing them to remain there while exploiting wind-driven currents for long-distance dispersal.

Unlike aversive memory formation, the development of claustrophobia-like behavior does not require dopamine receptors. Our neuronal screening determined that neuropeptide signalling via Allatostatin-A inactivates the downstream neurons via its receptor AstA-R1, causally inducing claustrophobia-like behavior. Moreover, gene expression profiling of individual fly heads revealed that immune response activation in perineurial barrier is involved in claustrophobia-like behavior.

We recorded sleep at home using portable polysomnography for multiple nights in patients with Parkinson's disease implanted with sensing DBS, capturing intracranial neural signals from both the basal ganglia and motor cortex. We found that longer duration and shorter latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep predicted reduced next-morning neural signatures known to be pathological, including resting beta oscillations and hyper-neural connectivity between basal ganglia and motor cortex. Moreover, within REM sleep, stronger cortical delta activity particularly predicted reduced pathological neural signatures. Computational modeling of the evoked potential response in the basal-cortical circuit revealed that REM delta activity was associated with not only the amplitude of the evoked response, but also its natural oscillatory and decaying properties, suggesting REM sleep-mediated neural plasticity. The anti-relationship between delta activity and morning pathological neural signals was found to be primarily driven by the amplitude of delta waves, and less by their occurrence rate. In addition, as the REM sleep percentage and REM delta power increased in later hours during sleep, their protective effects also increased. Overall, our findings highlight the potential protective roles of REM sleep and its associated slow-wave activity in the neurophysiological health of Parkinson's disease.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

The nose-to-brain (N-2-B) pathway offers a promising alternative, enabling pharmacological agents to circumvent the BBB. However, to date, no drugs have been successfully implemented in clinical settings for the treatment of AD via this route, underscoring the necessity for additional research in this area. Mild stress is thought to activate intrinsic protective mechanisms against neurodegeneration, but traditional methods of inducing stress often lack both specificity and practicality. To address this, we propose inhaling mildly heated air as thermal stimulation, leveraging the N-2-B pathway to elicit mild stress and stimulate the brain. Furthermore, this study employs our thermal cycling hyperthermia (TC-HT) concept, adapted as thermal cycling stimulation via nasal inhalation (TCSNI), which delivers cyclic stimulation to sustain pathway activity while minimizing thermal damage. In this study, we evaluated the health and olfactory effects of TCSNI in C57BL/6 mice, observing no adverse impact. In experimental groups administered with {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}), TCSNI treatment resulted in significant enhancements in cognitive performance as evidenced by Y-Maze and novel object recognition (NOR) assessments, suggesting an improvement in cognitive function. Protein analyses conducted on the hippocampus of the mice indicated a reduction in A{beta} accumulation, alongside increased expression of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression, as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt). These results suggest that N-2-B-delivered TCSNI effectively modulates protein expression and enhances cognitive function, highlighting its potential for further exploration in AD treatment.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Pupil size fluctuations reflect rapid changes of the pupil-linked arousal system, indexing brain states as well as the activity of neuromodulatory systems, including the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. We investigated the relationship among phasic pupil dilation, cortical state, and neuromodulation by combining optogenetic LC stimulation with EEG recordings and pupillometry in awake mice. A comparison between EEG signals during spontaneous phasic pupil dilation and those during phasic pupil dilation evoked by LC stimulation revealed distinct EEG power spectrums, with LC activation driving strong modulation in the alpha and beta bands. Using machine learning techniques, we trained a convolutional neural network classifier to distinguish between types of pupil dilation based on the power dynamics of individual EEG frequency bands. The results confirmed that EEG features in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands differ markedly between spontaneous phasic arousal and LC stimulation-evoked arousal. Moreover, pharmacological manipulations to either block  or {beta} adrenergic receptors or agonize -2 adrenergic receptors were employed to explore how adrenergic receptors could influence the coupling between phasic pupil dilation and cortical state. With each manipulation uniquely modulating EEG power and pupil size, our results highlight the differentiated role of adrenergic receptors in the maintenance of coupling between pupil-linked arousal and cortical state.

In this study, we focused on the effort requirements of the task, asking whether task (background) effort cost affects learning, aftereffects, or relearning in a split-belt walking task. We hypothesized that greater effort costs would amplify the need to reduce effort and accelerate learning. Alternatively, we hypothesized that greater effort requirement could compromise and slow the learning process. Participants in high, low, and control effort groups completed a split-belt walking task while wearing a weighted vest with 15% body mass, 5% body mass, or the vest only, and we assessed step length asymmetry throughout the protocol. Step length asymmetry changed similarly between groups, with similar rates and extent of learning and relearning and similar patterns of aftereffects when the split-belt perturbation was removed.

One key challenge is defining mechanisms conferring robust linkage and mechanosensing. Drosophila Canoe and mammalian Afadin provide superb entrypoints to explore how their complex protein structures and shared IDRs enable function. We combined genetic, cell biological and biochemical tools to define how Canoes IDR functions during morphogenesis. Unlike many of Canoes folded domains, the IDR is critical for junctional localization, mechanosensing and function. We took the IDR apart, identifying two conserved stickers in the IDR that directly bind F-actin, separated by less-conserved spacers. Surprisingly, while mutants lacking the IDR die as embryos with morphogenesis defects, no sub-region of the IDR is essential for viability. Instead, IDR stickers and spacers act combinatorially to ensure localization, mechanosensing and function.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Here we use a range of lipid chemical biology approaches to investigate the effect of 1-deoxySLs on the properties and functions of secretory membranes. We first applied organelle-specific bioorthogonal labeling to visualize the subcellular distribution of metabolically-tagged 1-deoxySLs, observing that they become enriched in the ER of RPE-1 cells. While 1-deoxydihydroceramide is rapidly transported by the non-vesicular ceramide transporter CERT in vitro, they are retained in ER exit sites (ERES), suggesting that they do not efficiently sort into vesicular carriers leaving the ER. RPE-1 cells engineered to express disease-associated variants of serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT) were then used to test the consequences of this ER retention. Overproduction of 1-deoxySLs decreased ER membrane fluidity, as measured by the solvatochromic dye Laurdan, and enlarged ERES themselves. These effects could be partially phenocopied through inhibition of canonical sphingolipid metabolism and ceramide trafficking. Rates of synchronized protein cargo release from the ER were altered in response to 1-deoxySL accumulation in a manner that was dependent on cargo affinity for ordered or disordered membranes. We propose that altered lipid metabolism and trafficking can modulate the properties of secretory membranes, which could be relevant for protein trafficking in diseases with altered sphingolipid metabolism.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

However, apart from ATP production, mitochondria have many other functions the aberration of which may impact neurons in very different ways. Oxidative stress can cause the deterioration of axonal microtubule bundles, thus critically affecting the highways for life-sustaining transport and providing a potential path to neurodegeneration. We recently found that aberrant transport of mitochondria can have this effect by causing oxidative stress. We therefore asked which aberrations of mitochondrial physiology might impact microtubules, which of these might explain the observed consequences of aberrant mitochondrial transport, and whether mitochondria-induced microtubule phenotypes are always mediated by oxidative stress. Using one consistent Drosophila primary neuron system, we deleted 13 different mitochondrial factors known to be detrimental for neurons in vivo. Losses of five factors caused MT damage, all involving oxidative stress, hence supporting the path from mitochondria via oxidative stress to microtubule deterioration; we discuss Sod2 as potential candidate explaining effects of mitochondrial transport aberration. However, the loss of eight factors - seven of them important mitochondrial morphogenesis regulators - caused no microtubule damage, suggesting potential oxidative stress-independent pathways.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Localised photoinactivation of EB1 reveals that microtubule ends reaching distinct cortical regions differently influence spindle movements. Using a dynein inhibitor gradient, we separate dynein's role in spindle positioning (maintaining pole-to-cortex distance) from its role in directing spindle movements. EB1 photoinactivation of whole spindles uncovers a previously unrecognised synergistic role for dynein and EB1 in maintaining astral microtubules reaching the cortex. We demonstrate the EB1-dependent role for dynein in maintaining astral microtubule growth is independent of its classical cortical roles by analysing dynamic changes in spindle position, displacement rates and cortical dynein localisation and by depleting dynein's cortical platform, LGN.

The dynamics of the mitochondrial network, including fusion and fission, play a crucial role in mitochondrial inheritance by facilitating the distribution and quality control of mitochondria. In budding yeast, simultaneous inhibition of both fusion and fission leads to loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity, resulting in an increased frequency of petite cells. Loss of mitochondrial fusion alone results in the complete loss of mtDNA. While the loss of mtDNA in the absence of mitochondrial fusion has been known for almost 30 years, the reason remained unclear. Here, we investigate the consequences of impaired mitochondrial fusion through depletion of the mitofusin Fzo1. We follow the emerging phenotype by live-cell imaging and the analysis of more than thirty thousand single cells across their cell cycle. Fzo1 depletion causes rapid mitochondrial fragmentation and a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by a progressive decline of mtDNA content and cellular growth rate over several cell divisions. During division, Fzo1-depleted daughters obtain an unusually large amount of mitochondria, leaving the mother with too little. This results in a strong disbalance of mitochondrial mass in the population. Additionally, Fzo1-depleted cells lose the ability to adjust mtDNA synthesis to compensate for a low mitochondrial content. The combined effects of unequal distribution and reduced synthesis drive rapid mtDNA loss. These results show how fusion defects lead to mtDNA loss and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to understanding diseases linked to fusion defects.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

This inherently requires receptors to increase the concentration of active-state G proteins on the endosome membrane, but how this is achieved remains incompletely understood. We addressed this question by dissecting the regulation of G protein abundance and activity on endosomes following activation of several Gs-coupled GPCRs-the {beta}2-adrenergic receptor, the VIP-1 receptor, and the adenosine 2b receptor-that are natively co-expressed and differ in their ability to internalize after activation. We first verify GPCR-triggered redistribution of Gs from the plasma membrane to a mixed population of intracellular membranes, including endosomes, that is both reversible after receptor inactivation and triggered irrespective of the ability of the GPCR to internalize. We next show that GPCRs trigger this redistribution process at native expression levels and describe a method, using conformational biosensors, to detect endosomal activation of endogenous Gs. Applying this method, we show that GPCR-mediated production of active-state Gs on endosomes depends on receptor endocytosis, whereas increasing the net amount of Gs on endosomes does not. Our results support a model for Gs regulation on endosomes mediated by two spatially separated receptor coupling events-one at the plasma membrane controlling endosomal Gs abundance and another at endosomes controlling Gs activity.

The problem can be framed as a ranking problem where genes are ranked based on a set of phenotypes using a measure of phenotype similarity. When phenotypes are described using phenotype ontologies, ontology-based semantic similarity measures are used. Traditional semantic similarity measures use only the ontology taxonomy. Recent methods based on ontology embeddings compare phenotypes in latent space; these methods can use all ontology axioms as well as a supervised signal, but are inherently transductive, i.e., queries must already be known at the time of learning embeddings, and therefore these methods do not generalize to novel diseases (sets of phenotypes) at inference time. Results: We developed an inductive method for ranking genes based on a set of phenotypes. Our method first uses a graph projection to map axioms from phenotype ontologies to a graph structure, and then uses ontology embeddings to create latent representations of phenotypes. We use an explicit aggregation strategy to combine phenotype embeddings into representations of genes or diseases, allowing us to generalize to novel sets of phenotypes. We also develop a method to make the phenotype embeddings and the similarity measure task-specific by including a supervised signal from known gene--disease associations. We apply our method to mouse models of human disease and demonstrate that we can significantly improve over inductive baseline measures, and reach a performance similar to transductive methods for predicting gene--disease associations while being more general.

Recently, inhibitors of the most common KRAS mutation, KRASG12D, have entered the clinical arena. However, early evidence suggests that as monotherapy, KRASG12D inhibitors such as MRTX1133 at best provide brief periods of disease stabilization. Hence, there is a growing interest in understanding the mechanisms through which tumors acquire resistance to KRAS inhibition. In the present study, we generated in vitro models of MRTX1133 resistance and subjected parental and drug-resistant cell lines to RNA sequencing. This suggested that MRTX1133-resistant tumor cells undergo a global shift toward histone acetylation. Inhibition of the histone acetyltransferase EP300 reversed the drug-resistant phenotype in vitro, which subsequent RNA sequencing experiments determined was associated with the suppression of pro-survival FOSL1 signaling. Accordingly, siFOSL1 reversed the MRTX1133-resistant phenotype with similar effects on pro-survival signaling. Given the lack of clinically useful EP300 or FOSL1 inhibitors, we next explored whether inhibitors of the acetylation scanning BET proteins would be similarly effective. The addition of BET inhibitors re-sensitized several resistant cell lines to MRTX1133 and impaired FOSL1-mediated survival signaling in vitro. In murine models of MRTX1133-resistant PDAC, BET inhibition cooperated with MRTX1133 to markedly extend overall survival. As BET inhibitors are currently under clinical testing, the combination of MRTX1133 and BET inhibitors warrants further investigation, particularly in tumors that have developed resistance to KRAS inhibition.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

In immunodeficient mice, this behavior manifested in the outgrowth of stiffer metastatic cells in the rigid bone than in the soft lung, while in immunocompetent hosts, it led to preferential elimination of stiffer cancer cells and suppression of bone metastasis. Environmentally-induced cell stiffening and immune sensitization both required Osteopontin, a secreted glycoprotein that is upregulated during bone colonization. Analysis of patient metastases spanning mechanically distinct tissues revealed associations between environmental rigidity, immune infiltration, and cancer cell stiffness consistent with mechanically driven immunosurveillance. These results demonstrate how environmental mechanosensing modulates anti-tumor immunity and suggest a mechanoimmunological basis for metastatic site selection.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Targeted inhibition of DNA damage response proteins has received significant clinical attention owing to the success of PARP inhibitors. Due to the loss of the G1/S checkpoint, cancer cells are reliant on the G2/M checkpoint to cope with elevated DNA replication stress. We previously demonstrated a single induction of 8-oxo-guanine at telomeres in cancer cells was sufficient to induce replication stress, but was well tolerated at the cellular level. Here, we found inhibition of ATR, Chk1, or Wee1 after induction of telomere oxidative stress significantly induced genome instability and reduced cell viability. This occurred at doses markedly less than those required to increase instability in non-cancer cells. We determined the mechanism of this instability is due to cells progressing through S-phase with telomere damage and exiting G2-phase prematurely, prolonging their mitosis. This study demonstrates targeted oxidative base damage at telomeres can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ATR inhibition in cancer.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrated single-nucleus RNA and chromatin accessibility multi-ome profiles from over one million cells across primary IDH-wildtype GBs and developed scDORI, a scalable deep-learning framework to infer enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) at single-cell resolution. Our analysis revealed a structured hierarchy of GB cell states governed by distinct regulatory programs, with marked variability in epigenetic plasticity that enables or constrains transitions. Neuronal-like tumor cells emerge as a low plasticity state that deploys active repression, in contrast to more permissive progenitor-like and astrocytic states. We identified the neuronal-like state-specific repressor MYT1L as a key regulator that silences master transcription factors of alternative states. MYT1L gain-of-function in patient-derived GB cells reduced chromatin accessibility, induced neuronal-like identity, and restricted proliferation and invasion in vivo, whereas loss-of-function reactivated plasticity and accelerated malignant features. Our findings delineate the epigenetic architecture and associated transcriptional master regulators that shape GB state trajectories, and establish safeguard repressors such as MYT1L as potential therapeutic targets to constrain malignant plasticity.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

It is unclear whether all proteins are buffered similarly, what factors determine buffering, and whether dosage compensation varies across different cell lines or tumor types. Moreover, its potential adaptive advantage and therapeutic relevance remain unexplored. We established a novel approach to quantify protein dosage buffering in a gene copy number-dependent manner, showing that dosage compensation is widespread but variable in cancer samples. By developing multifactorial machine learning models, we identify gene dependency, protein complex participation, haploinsufficiency, and mRNA decay as key predictors of buffering. We show that dosage compensation affects oncogenic potential, and that higher buffering correlates with reduced proteotoxic stress and increased drug resistance.

However, challenges have prevented the broad exploration of tandem SH2 domain avidity and here we utilize advances in both computational modeling and experimental approaches to predict and test tandem SH2 domain recruitment. Theoretical model behavior suggests that maximum avidity occurs with closely spaced or flexibly linked phosphotyrosine sites, combined with moderate monovalent affinities - exactly around the affinities of SH2 domains with individual phosphotyrosine sites. Surprisingly, despite sequence diversity, structure-based analysis showed remarkably conserved three-dimensional spacing between SH2 domains across all tandem SH2 families, which we interrogate experimentally, suggesting evolutionary optimization for avidity interactions. The combination of structure-based analysis of domain spacing with available monovalent experimental data appears to be sufficiently accurate to rank order predict high affinity interactions of tandem SH2 domain recruitment to the EGFR C-terminal tail.

While metabolic control of T cell phenotypic fates has been demonstrated in some contexts, gaps still exist in our knowledge of how T cell metabolic dynamics early during CAR T manufacturing might affect critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the final product (e.g., differentiation/exhaustion/potency).

We validate our estimated rates using metabolic assays, show how average rates can be deconvoluted to rates of individual T cell phenotypes, and demonstrate applicability to different reactor types. Applying our tool to the expansion of both healthy and patient-derived cells in a perfusion-based microbioreactor, we offer proof-of-principle to show that correlations exist between early metabolic rates of T cells in culture and cellular attributes related to growth, differentiation and exhaustion of the final product.

Tumors developed in CAF-specific C3 knockout mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, with increased immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage infiltration.

Emerging evidence suggests that the p53-induced RNA-binding protein ZMAT3 is a key splicing regulator that functions in p53-dependent tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism by which ZMAT3 functions in the p53 pathway is largely unclear. Here, we discovered a function of ZMAT3 in inhibiting transcription of HKDC1, a hexokinase that regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified HKDC1 as the most significantly upregulated protein in ZMAT3-depleted colorectal cancer cells. ZMAT3 depletion results in increased mitochondrial respiration that was rescued upon depletion of HKDC1, suggesting that HKDC1 is a critical downstream effector of ZMAT3. Unexpectedly, ZMAT3 did not bind to the HKDC1 RNA or DNA but the identification of the ZMAT3-interactome uncovered its interaction with the oncogenic transcription factor JUN. ZMAT3 depletion resulted in increased JUN binding at the HKDC1 promoter and increased HKDC1 transcription that was rescued upon JUN depletion, suggesting that JUN activates HKDC1 transcription in ZMAT3-depleted cells. Collectively, these data reveal a mechanism by which ZMAT3 regulates transcription and demonstrates that HKDC1 is a key component of the ZMAT3-regulated transcriptome in the context of mitochondrial respiration regulation.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

To investigate this, we recreated two BRCA2 pathogenic truncating variants in heterozygosis in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells. Cells carrying a truncating mutation that was not produced prompted sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) and reduced the HR capacity indicating haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, the other variant was expressed as a truncated product and prompted a transcriptional rewiring. Mechanistically, the truncated BRCA2 product formed abnormal oligomers with full-length BRCA2 and bound to the PCAF acetyltransferase, sequestering it. This led to reduced global histone H4 acetylation and decreased NF-{kappa}B transcriptional activity, ultimately impairing epithelial cell migration--a process also altered in tumors.

As such, differences between morphant and mutant zebrafish models of human diseases have led to significant difficulties in phenotypic interpretation and translatability. One form of compensation is the maternal deposit of mRNAs and proteins into the oocyte that supports developmental processes before zygotic genome activation. In this study, we generated a zebrafish model of severe congenital muscular dystrophy by targeting protein O-mannose N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (pomgnt2), a maternally provided gene that maintains cell-extracellular matrix interactions through glycosylation. Zygotic knockouts (ZKOs) retain protein function in the first week post-fertilization and survive to adulthood, though they develop muscle disease later in life. In contrast, maternal-zygotic KOs (MZKOs) generated from ZKO females develop early-onset muscle disease, reduced motor function, neuronal axon guidance deficits, and retinal synapse disruptions, recapitulating features of the human presentation. While assessing transcriptional changes linked to disease progression, the availability of embryos obtained from different breeding strategies also allowed for direct comparison of ZKOs and MZKOs to define the impact of having a KO mother. We found that offspring from a ZKO mother, independently of genotype, show distinct expression patterns from animals obtained from heterozygous breeding. Some of these changes reflect an increased metabolic requirement, possibly stemming from maternal metabolic disruption. These findings will not only be applicable to other CMD models targeting maternally provided genes but also provide new insight into modeling disease using maternal-zygotic mutants.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

But existing image segmentation methods struggle with staining variability and background noise. To address this, we developed a more robust segmentation and statistical analysis pipeline using an animal model small sample size and with known neuronal microstructure alterations. Methods: Maternal obesity was induced in mice via a high-fat/high-sucrose diet. Hippocampal tissue from 6-month-old offspring of obese and control dams was analyzed. We developed a MATLAB-based pipeline to segment neuronal cilia from z-stack images, applying mathematical transformations and using the Weibull distribution and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess group differences Results: The technique segmented cilia despite artifacts, revealing group-specific patterns. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences, highlighting the method's robustness over traditional tests, especially with small samples.

Dysregulation of the underlying mechanisms can result in organ malformation and tumorigenesis. Although the Hippo signaling pathway plays a key role in regulating organ growth, the precise regulation of its effectors, YAP1 and WWTR1, remains unclear. To gain insights into tissue growth control during organ formation, we used the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium (pLLP), a migratory group of epithelial cells that forms sensory organs, as a model. We demonstrate that Yap1 growth-promoting activity in the pLL system is modulated not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus by Vgll4 proteins. We propose a model in which Yap1, together with Tead proteins, ensures that the pLLP contains a sufficient number of cells before migration begins. Vgll4b and Vgll4l, in contrast, function partially redundantly, to limit pLLP cell number, with Vgll4b showing a stronger tumor-suppressor activity. Our data indicate that Vgll4b/4l counteract Yap1 activity by competing with Yap1 for binding to Tead proteins, but also via a Yap1-independent mechanism. Altogether, this study reveals that a precise balance between Yap1 and Vgll4 proteins ensures proper regulation of cell number in the pLLP.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

One of the leading mechanisms by which these variants are thought to affect disease susceptibility is by altering transcription factor (TF) binding. Even though inbred mouse strains have been commonly used to investigate polygenic diseases, less is known on how their genetic differences translate to the level of gene regulation and chromatin landscape. Here, we investigated how genetic variation affects chromatin accessibility, a commonly used proxy for TF binding, and how this relates to gene regulation in the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ mice fed either chow or high-fat diet. We show that differences in chromatin accessibility are almost exclusively strain-specific and driven by genetic variation. In addition, we integrate ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility) and H3K27ac ChIP-seq (active regulatory regions) data to show that tissue-specific TFs are commonly found in the active regulatory regions hosting TF binding motif altering variants in eWAT. By incorporating footprint analysis, we also show that TF occupancy is consistent with TF binding motif scores at the genetically altered loci. In addition, we validate these findings by extending the footprint analysis to ATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data obtained from the liver. Also, we employ RNA-seq to show that differentially expressed genes are collocated with differentially accessible regions hosting genetic variants. Overall, our findings highlight the connection between differential chromatin accessibility, TF binding and genetic variation and their role in the gene regulation across metabolically central tissues of a mouse model for polygenic obesity.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

We find that there is not an absolute hierarchy: while flies typically perform grooming first, they can choose to feed if sufficiently starved, or court if an appropriate female is available. Flies alternate between competing behaviors, performing short bouts of each action rather than completely satisfying one drive before transitioning to another. And we do not find evidence for a common genetic or neuronal locus that affects all decisions, suggesting that the fly may select the best course of action by discrete circuits regulating each pairwise comparison.

The extensive diversification of IFN-Is into multiple subtypes and redundant gene copies has posed significant challenges for evolutionary reconstruction. To address this, we developed an integrated analytical pipeline combining the IFN-SCOPE classification model and GENE-GRADE algorithm. Through comprehensive synteny-guided phylogenetic analysis, we identified three evolutionarily conserved IFN-I loci (HACD4, MOB3B, and UBAP2) that maintain chromosomal colocalization across all major amniote lineages - mammals, squamates, and Archelosauria (turtles, crocodilians, and birds). While MOB3B-locus maintains a single IFN-{kappa} ortholog, the HACD4 (IFN-H) and UBAP2 (IFN-U) loci show lineage-specific expansion patterns: IFN-H proliferated in mammals/reptiles but remained single-copy in birds, whereas IFN-U expanded in birds but not in other lineages. Phylogenetic analysis reveals these independently evolved multicopy genes nevertheless cluster into two conserved subgroups (IFN-H2/H1 and IFN-U2/U1), suggesting convergent functional specialization. Within IFN-H and IFN-U clusters, the single-copy IFN-H2 and IFN-U2 genes - positioned at the ancestral ends of their respective genomic arrays - likely represent the progenitor sequences of each locus. Notably, among mammalian IFN-H2 genes, we identified the poorly characterized IFN-{upsilon} (rather than IFN-{beta}) as the ancestral form of mammalian IFN-H subtypes. Furthermore, we identified IFN-I genes at non-canonical loci resulting from interchromosomal duplication events in tortoises and diving ducks and provide clear evidence that interchromosomal duplications contributed to IFN-I gene diversity. These discoveries advance our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms shaping intronless IFN-I genes in amniotes, and potentially beneficial for developing novel IFN-I based antiviral treatments through comparative immunological approaches.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

However, the extent of inter-individual variability in response to HReT, and the possible existence of non-responders, remains unclear. The primary aim was to determine the presence of inter-individual variability in the response to prolonged HReT in healthy older individuals. Secondary aims were to classify individual responsiveness using a combination of gold-standard assessment methods, and to explore training progression and baseline levels as possible response moderators. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of an 8- and 16-week intervention of thrice weekly HReT (EX) or continuation of a sedentary lifestyle (SED). 58 healthy men (age 72+/-5) were randomized into EX (n=38) or SED (n=20). Assessments were conducted at baseline, mid-intervention (8wk), and post-intervention (16wk) for five outcomes: Maximal voluntary contraction strength (MVC), rate of force development (RFD), quadriceps cross-sectional area (qCSA), and type I and II myofibre cross-sectional area (fCSA). Training compliance and progression (as measured by 1-repetition maximum (1RM)) were monitored. Inter-individual variability was assessed using the standard deviation of individual responses (SDIR). Individual change scores relative to a Typical Error (TE) were used to classify individuals as Poor, Trivial, Robust or Excellent responders. Results: At the group level, EX increased MVC, RFD, qCSA and type II fCSA by 19+/-14 %, 58+/-80 %, 3+/-4 % and 14+/-25 %, respectively, with no changes in SED. Inter-individual variability was observed for all outcomes. Individual responses to HReT were outcome- and time-dependent, with 31 participants (82%) being classified as Robust or Excellent responders, and two participants (5%) being Poor responders, following 16wk of HReT. Training compliance and 1RM progression did not account for the observed response variability following HReT. Lower baseline levels were associated with greater improvements; however, this did not account for the observed inter-individual variability. Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence of inter-individual variability in response to HReT among healthy older men. Given the rarity of true non-responders, HReT should remain the universally recommended first-line strategy for enhancing muscle mass and strength in this population.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

However, moderate to high surface winds are often present on spawning nights in specific regions, with many unknown impacts to the early life-history stages of corals. Here, we mechanistically examine the sensitivity of fertilisation and larval development to increasing wind speeds for four common species of hermaphroditic corals on the Great Barrier Reef: Acropora kenti, A. millepora, A. spathulata, and Platygyra daedalea. Wind intensities relevant to coral spawning seasons were simulated by downscaling location-specific, historical wind speeds to laboratory flumes. Generally, fertilisation success declined as duration of exposure increased and was often lowest at the highest wind intensity equating to 15 knots in situ. Embryo damage, deformity, and fragmentation increased with exposure time, but varied across species. Four days following spawning, damaged and fragmented embryos had the highest mortality rates (76-82% and 70-73%) compared to intact embryos (26% and 52%) for A. kenti and A. spathulata, respectively. Experimental parameters were used to fit a 3D Fluid Dynamics model with outputs confirming that water surface elevations, velocity, and turbulence energy increased by up to 10%, 40%, and 50% respectively as winds intensified, likely explaining the physical drivers of the deleterious effects observed. Overall, results from this study indicate that suboptimal spawning conditions reduce propagule production, which may diminish recovery potential, thus require consideration when planning management strategies to safeguard coral reproduction.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we reveal a novel functional synergism between H3K79me and H3K36 tri-methylation (H3K36me3), another histone modification enriched at active genes, in regulating gene expression and neural cell fate transition. Simultaneous catalytic inactivation of DOT1L and the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2 via gene editing leads to the global loss of H3K79me and H3K36me3, hyperactive transcription, and failures in neural differentiation. Interestingly, the loss of H3K79me and H3K36me3 causes increased transcription elongation, gained chromatin accessibility at a group of enhancers, and increased binding of TEAD4 transcription factor and its co-activator YAP1 at these enhancers. Furthermore, YAP-TEAD inhibition partially restores the expression levels of hyperactivated genes upon H3K79me/H3K36me3 loss. Taken together, our study demonstrates a synergistic role of H3K79me and H3K36me3 in regulating transcription and cell fate transition, unveils novel mechanisms underlying such synergism, and provides insight into designing therapies that target diseases driven by misregulation or mutations of DOT1L and/or SETD2.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

To determine whether social pain can subsequently impact responses to nociceptive stimuli via convergent electrical signals (spikes) or convergent chemical signals (neuromodulators), we designed a novel Social Exclusion paradigm termed the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) Task which facilitates a mechanistic investigation in mice. We found that socially-excluded mice display more severe responses to physical pain, disrupted valence encoding, and impaired neural representations of nociceptive stimuli.

Some Prochlorococcus reduce and divert up to 20-30% of the nitrate that they take up to external pools of nitrite. Given that nitrite is a central intermediate of the nitrogen cycle and Prochlorococcus is highly abundant in nitrogen-limited waters, our goal was to advance our understanding of nitrite cycling in the context of nitrogen limitation. Here we observe that nitrate-limited Prochlorococcus have cell-specific nitrite production rates that are approximately a magnitude higher than nitrogen-replete Prochlorococcus when challenged with a pulse of nitrate. Nitrite production rates are unchanged or depressed during light and cold shocks, suggesting that nitrate is not used as an alternative electron acceptor to mitigate the impacts of excess photochemically generated electrons. These results suggest that in regions where phytoplankton growth is limited by nitrogen, Prochlorococcus cells could be primed to transform substantial quantities of nitrate into extracellular pools of nitrite during episodic upwellings of nitrate-rich water. Given that nitrite is an important intermediate in the nitrogen cycle, these results have ramifications for our understanding of nitrogen cycling in nitrogen-limited open ocean ecosystems.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Green streamers of Cladophora proliferate in early summer, then change from green to yellow and then red-brown as epiphyte loads increase and their taxonomic composition shifts. We characterized successional changes in epiphytic bacteria and archaea on Cladophora, examining both abundance and growth rates, using quantitative Stable Isotope Probing (qSIP) and16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess taxonomy and potential function. The number of bacterial taxa increased with succession while growth rates peaked in the middle successional stage. NanoSIMS imaging confirmed high sulfur (S) concentrations in Cladophora cell walls relative to surrounding biomass, which may have contributed to the bloom of sulfur bacteria (bacteria that reduce or oxidize sulfur/sulfates) as cell walls decompose. In general, relative abundances and growth rates of epiphytic cells were independent, indicating that either metric alone is insufficient for understanding how species and functional groups affect ecosystem processes. For instance, the relative abundance of N-fixers was highest on red Cladophora when their relative growth rates were lowest. Similarly, denitrifying bacteria were most abundant on green Cladophora when their growth rates were lowest. Such patterns may be driven by growth limitation due to space competition. Together, changes in abundance and relative growth rates suggest different limiting factors for different functional groups in the Cladophora microbiome at multiple successional stages.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Consistent with thermodynamic and stoichiometric predictions, negative NOSC compounds are catabolized more slowly but produce more methane per mole of carbon. Negative NOSC microbiomes have higher alpha diversity, more syntrophs and methanogens, and fewer fermentative bacteria. Strikingly, fermentative bacterial taxa display genomically encoded NOSC catabolic preferences both in the lab and field. Negative NOSC-preferring fermenters have longer predicted doubling times, consistent with the thermodynamic recalcitrance of their preferred substrates.

In susceptible patients, its hyphal filamentous form can invade and damage host epithelium leading to local or systemic infection. The secreted fungal toxin candidalysin is required for epithelial damage, although both hyphal extension and candidalysin are required for inducing maximal infection damage, for reasons that are not well understood. Here we study the interplay between hyphal extension and host damage in vitro using live cell imaging combined with damage-sensitive reporters followed by single-cell level quantitative analysis. We show that fungal load is inversely proportional to single-cell damage potential, and we quantify candidalysin-induced damage. We then determine the three-dimensional architecture of invasion and show that the spatial organization of host membrane rupture is regulated by candidalysin and is predictive of host cell death. Finally, we demonstrate that membrane rupture occurs at two distinct host subcellular niches: the juxtanuclear region and the cell-cell boundary, with the latter the main driver of subsequent host cell death. Based on these results, we propose that C. albicans invasion damages epithelia in a sequential process in which candidalysin secretion acts to prime host membranes enveloping invading hyphae for subsequent rupture. Hyphal traversal of two distinct host subcellular niches then triggers membrane rupture, resulting in a niche-specific host response that is predictive of host cell survival or death.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we conducted a comprehensive exploration of eCIS tail fiber genes, providing insights into their remarkable diversity, target cells, functional adaptations, and intriguing evolutionary dynamics. We identified 3,445 eCIS tail fiber proteins found in 2,585 eCIS loci from 1,069 microbes.

Importantly, we leveraged structure prediction to divide the fibers into 276 structural clusters and dissected 1,177 domain fold families which likely mediate glycan and protein binding on the cell surface of eukaryotes or bacterial targets. These rapidly evolving domains are likely acquired from diverse genomes of eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses.

Two putative cardiolipin synthases, ClsA and ClsB, have been linked to bile acid tolerance in B. fragilis, yet their specific physiological roles remain undefined. Although ClsA and ClsB are conserved across Bacteroides species, they are phylogenetically distinct from the well-characterized cardiolipin synthases of Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Here, we show that these enzymes have distinct cardiolipin synthase activities and make non-redundant contributions to B. fragilis fitness under gut-relevant stress conditions, including osmotic stress, disruption of membrane potential, and exposure to the bile acid deoxycholate. While deoxycholate disrupted K/Na homeostasis in B. fragilis, deletion of clsA or clsB did not significantly alter intracellular ion levels, suggesting that loss of cardiolipin synthase function does not directly impact ion balance under standard cultivation conditions. High resolution mass spectrometry-based lipidomic analyses showed that cardiolipin comprises less than 1% of B. fragilis membranes and that ClsA and ClsB produce distinct cardiolipin products with unique acyl chain lengths and levels of unsaturation. Deletion of either cls gene led to Cls-specific remodeling of B. fragilis envelope lipid content, which was also associated with shifts in non-lipid metabolites indicative of stress-induced metabolic changes. These results demonstrate distinct roles for ClsA and ClsB in shaping B. fragilis membrane composition, metabolism, and stress responses and offer new insight into how bile acids impact the physiology of a common member of the gut microbiota.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

By integrating mathematical modeling, single-cell microfluidics, and time-resolved flow cytometry, we evaluate bacterial survival under heavy metal and {beta}-lactam antibiotic stress. Our results show that filamentation can improve survival by decreasing the surface area-to-volume ratio, which slows intracellular toxin accumulation and extends the time available for stress response activation or for external toxin levels to dissipate.

In Escherichia coli, the Nudix hydrolase RppH initiates mRNA degradation by removing pyrophosphate from mRNA 5' ends, converting 5'-triphosphates to 5'-monophosphates. We aimed to identify the RppH homolog in the globally important pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We deleted each non-essential Nudix gene from Mtb to determine their impacts on mRNA phosphorylation states. Deletion of mutT4 (Rv3908) increased the relative abundance of 5'-triphosphates on myriad mRNAs across the transcriptome. Purified MutT4 converted mRNA 5'-triphosphates into monophosphates, and stimulated degradation by RNase E and RNase J. MutT4 has intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), a common domain for biomolecular condensate formation. Microscopy showed that MutT4 forms condensates that dissociate upon addition of rifampicin, and that the N-terminal IDR is sufficient for condensate formation. These MutT4 condensates localize with RNase E and RNase J. Deletion of mutT4 in Mtb leads to a higher outer membrane permeability and resistance to oxidative stress. We conclude that MutT4 is the RppH homolog of Mtb, assembling in condensates that may act as degradation hubs.

A.; Jerome, K. R.; Schiffer, J. T.; Walter, M.", "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection of epithelial cells is lytic, while infection of neurons typically results in long-term latency. However, the rates at which HSV-1 replicates and spreads in epithelial cells versus neurons under low and high multiplicity of infection (MOI) conditions remain undefined. Identifying these rates requires the application of mathematical models to carefully designed viral kinetic experiments. It is also critical to differentiate the dynamics of infectious viral particles versus viral DNA, as both quantities are routinely measured in in vitro experiments and human studies using plaque assays and polymerase chain reactions, respectively. Here, we developed mechanistic mathematical models to describe HSV-1 dynamics after infection of epithelial Vero cells and neuronal N2A cells, at high (3) and low (0.01) MOI. Our model recapitulates the dynamics of cell-free and cell-associated viral DNA and plaque-forming units (PFU). In epithelial cells, the model describes a pre-productive eclipse phase with a mean duration of 10.9 and 12.8 hours prior to HSV DNA replication and PFU production, respectively. Cells exited the eclipse phase as early and late as 2.5 and 32 hours, respectively. Infected cells produced a single PFU for every 224 HSV DNA genomes. PFU egressed at a constant rate, whereas the HSV DNA egress rate increased over time, before saturating at a 15 times higher rate. Under low relative to high MOI conditions, Vero cells spent 7 hours longer in the eclipse phase, had a 12-hour delay prior to egress, and had a longer mean duration of productive infection (14 versus 3.5-hour half-life). Secondary epithelial cell infection in low MOI experiments was overwhelmingly due to cell-to-cell viral spread and originated from a small number of early-producer cells. Neuronal cells produced viruses at a 5-fold lower rate and had a longer (mean: 42 hours) and more variable eclipse phase, with some neurons remaining in eclipse for more than a week. Our results highlighted large differences in HSV egress rates, as well as infected cell eclipse phase duration and death rates, in epithelial cells versus neurons during low and high MOI infection.

Circular dichroism spectroscopy and secondary structure predictions confirmed that the identified aptamers adopt stable folded conformations.

As a counter defense, plant viruses evolved suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) to inhibit plant RNAi machinery, aiding viral replication and transmission. P0, a VSR encoded by the potato leafroll virus (PLRV), family Polerovirus, suppresses RNAi by targeting the plant protein ARGONATE 1 for degradation through its F-box motif interaction with a Skp1 subunit of the family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Our previous work shows PLRV P0 suppresses antiviral immunity in its aphid vector Myzus persicae, leading to an increase in aphid infection by the insect virus Myzus persicae densovirus (MpDNV). Here, we expand on these findings and show that the P0 protein also regulates aphid fecundity. Using a series of F-box mutants, we demonstrate that a functional P0 F-box motif is required for inhibition of MpDNV antiviral immunity but not modulation of aphid fecundity. We further show that silencing suppressors from non-aphid-borne plant viruses that target other components of the plants RNAi machinery also modulate aphid fecundity but MpDNV titer. Collectively, the results show that aphids have been favored by selection to modulate their anti-viral immunity and fecundity in response to changes in the plant RNAi pathways induced by plant viral infection.

Using bioinformatic methods to search viral genomes for more Type IV IRES RNAs, we discovered that megrivirus E (MeV-E) contains a putative Type IV IRES within its annotated 3' UTR. In addition to its unusual location downstream of the main coding region, the size of the MeV-E 3' IRES is substantially reduced compared to known Type IV IRESs. We confirmed the secondary structure of the MeV-E 3' IRES, determined its 3D structure in complex with the ribosome using cryoEM, and showed that the MeV-E 3' IRES initiates translation but at lower levels compared to the larger Type IV IRES in the MeV-E 5' UTR. We hypothesize that the absence of several domains in the MeV-E 3' IRES compared to other Type IV IRESs results in a loss of ribosomal protein interactions and a relative decrease in translation activity. This small Type IV IRES enables translation of a second open reading frame in the MeV-E genome, which likely encodes a transmembrane protein that is conserved in other megriviruses.

Here, we establish a direct link between DnaA activity and replication initiation by demonstrating robust oscillations in DnaA activity, which peak precisely at replication initiation across diverse growth conditions and genetic perturbations. Notably, these oscillations persist even when dnaA transcription remains constant, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that modulates DnaA activity independently of its expression. Additionally, we propose an extrusion model in which DNA-binding proteins sense biomass-DNA imbalance and extrude DnaA from the chromosome to trigger replication, overcoming limitations of existing models.

Gene expression was assessed using RNAseq at 72 and 96 h timepoints. Free phage numbers were assessed by plaque assay and qPCR. Results: Differential expression of P. aeruginosa genes, including those related to virulence factors such as prophage, type III secretion, exopolysaccharides and pyochelin production, was seen in co-culture conditions compared with single-species culture. In particular, at 72 h, there was lower expression of most LES prophage genes under co-culture conditions, and this corresponded with lower overall free phage at the same timepoint. Specifically, during co culture, there was a reduction in the levels of a D3112-like transposable phage, previously shown to have the ability to drive CF-like adaptations in an experimental evolution model, and an increase in levels of Pf1-like filamentous phage, associated with altered biofilm formation and immune responses. Conclusion: Gene expression changes during co-culture with Streptococcus and Rothia spp. were identified affecting key P. aeruginosa virulence factors including phage. Further work indicated changes to free phage levels of two important P. aeruginosa LESB58 prophage with the potential to affect P. aeruginosa adaptation, antibiotic resistance and host immune response in the CF lung. This study emphasises the importance of understanding the influence of lung commensals on focal pathogens in a complex microbiome.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

To overcome this Bacillus dominance, we developed a novel agar medium containing leaf mold extract (LME) and assessed its utility for isolating microorganisms from soil samples. For comparison, conventional yeast malt extract agar (YME agar) was used as a control. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that colonies cultured on YME agar predominantly consisted of Bacillus-related bacteria, whereas LME agar enabled the growth of a wider variety of taxa, particularly actinomycetes such as Streptomyces. Notably, LME agar supported a higher diversity of soil bacterial isolates even from samples with a low abundance of Bacillus-related species. Among the 138 isolates recovered from LME agar, some either exhibited very low 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to known species in public databases, or failed to yield 16S rRNA amplicons with conventional universal primers, suggesting the presence of previously uncharacterized or novel taxa. Furthermore, one unidentified isolate failed to grow on standard nutrient media (YME, BHI, LB10, or TSB), but proliferated in liquid leaf mold extract, indicating a specific nutrient dependency. These findings demonstrate that LME agar can facilitate the isolation of a broader spectrum of soil microorganisms (including rare and previously uncultured species) not readily recoverable on common basal media. Incorporation of ecosystem-derived substrates into culture media may greatly enhance the discovery and study of novel microbial diversity from environmental samples.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Herein, we report the identification of three novel lytic phages targeting vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis. While the isolated phages all belonged to the Kochikohdavirus genus, there were distinctive differences in their tail fibre proteins, affecting their adsorption. The phages showed strong antibacterial activity with wide host range, infecting >90% of the tested E. faecalis clinical and hospital wastewater isolates (n=13) with variable efficiency. The variation in host range was genomically correlated to the presence of the LicD gene in phage sensitive bacteria, which is responsible for phosphorylcholine decoration of the bacterial cell wall. Furthermore, the isolated phages were predicted to harbour genes encoding for depolymerase enzymes, which was confirmed by in vitro testing showing a >80% reduction in biofilm biomass. Phages inhibited bacterial growth for [&ge;]12 hours, followed by the emergence of bacteriophage insensitive mutants (BIMs) that were 4-fold more sensitive to vancomycin compared to parent strains. In addition, the isolated BIMs showed less capability of evading THP-1 macrophage and produced weaker biofilms.

Metabolome and transcriptome analyses indicate that iron deficiency caused by bacillibactin plays a critical role in downregulating the specialized metabolism of competing Penicillium species. Since many specialized metabolites of Penicillium spp. have antibacterial properties, we hypothesize that bacillibactin cross-protects other bacteria during fungal-bacterial community interactions.

In particular, there is growing evidence that the ''holobiont'' (host animal + microbiome community of bacteria, fungi, and archaea that live in an organism) affects how organisms respond to environmental stressors such as temperature and thus should be studied further. Rocky intertidal species such as Tegula snails are ideal organisms for these types of studies because closely related species exhibit variability in heat tolerance. Here, we assess potential microbiome bacterial contributions to thermal tolerance in Tegula eiseni, Tegula funebralis, and Tegula gallina that co-occur in southern California but occupy different intertidal heights that vary in thermal stress exposure. 16S sequencing of the V4 region of individuals of each species exposed to control or 5.5-hour heat stress conditions (maximum temperature = 34 {degrees}C) revealed distinct bacterial communities across species and temperature treatments. Moreover, unique bacteria of the microbiome were significantly enriched in each Tegula species. For example, Lutimonas, Polaribacter, and the exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacteria Pelagicoccus was most abundant in T. gallina, the species that occupies the highest intertidal heights and thus experiences heat stress most frequently. These results suggest that microbiome-derived metabolites such as EPS could be contributing to the higher thermal tolerance of T. gallina. Overall, this study demonstrates that the bacterial microbiome should be considered when examining mechanisms of thermal tolerance in marine invertebrates.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

The intracytoplasmic movement of nucleocapsids is crucial during the lifecycle of enveloped viruses, but the molecular mechanisms governing their assembly and transport are not fully understood. Using a MARV live-cell imaging system, we identified three nucleocapsid proteins-NP, VP35, and VP24-that are necessary and sufficient to form transport-competent nucleocapsid-like structures (NCLSs). These findings are consistent with observations in Ebola virus (EBOV). Interestingly, despite incompatibility among these proteins, VP30 interacts with nucleocapsid proteins from both MARV and EBOV, supporting viral transcription and replication in heterologous systems. Furthermore, we show that the conserved PPxPxY motif at the C-terminus of NP regulates NP?VP30 interactions in both homologous and heterologous contexts, and is crucial for VP30 association with NCLSs. Because this motif is conserved across filoviruses, it represents a promising target for antiviral development. Our findings advance the understanding of nucleocapsid formation and offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention against MARV and EBOV.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Each color bloom was dominated by a different algae, each exhibiting a unique pigment signature but with astaxanthin as the predominant pigment across all three blooms. The spectral reflectance of red snow algae was consistently lower than that of green algae, while orange algae had intermediate reflectance values. Specifically, red algae reduced reflectance by approximately 55% across the PAR range, while green algae reduced reflectance by 25%. Red algae also demonstrated the highest radiative forcing, double that of green algae, leading to increased energy re-emission into the surrounding environment, which likely contributes to the localized melting of adjacent ice crystals. The high absorbance around 680 nm in cells with high astaxanthin content, such as the orange algae, suggests that semi-automatic detection methods could effectively identify these algae, as their spectral features remain distinct despite the presence of secondary carotenoids.

The findings suggest that both anionic and cationic water pools fold the telomere sequences into G4 of the same topology. However, the thermal stability of the folded G4 in the cationic water pool is significantly lower than that of the anionic case. The overall data indicate that the topology of the folded G4 is insensitive to the nature of the confinement, however, the thermal stability of the folded telomeric G4 depends significantly on the chemical nature of the confinement. It is plausible that the interfacial water inside the cationic water pools has a different orientation and hydrogen bonding than the case of anionic water pools, which may cause the different thermal stability of the G4 on these two water pools. These findings may be important in understanding the folding and stability of telomere G4 inside the confined cellular system.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Comparisons with X-ray diffraction measurements further validate our findings. Applying this approach to a sarcomeric mutation associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we show that R403Q/MYH7-mutated minipigs exhibit a higher ON fraction compared to controls. This difference is abolished under high concentrations of myosin modulators, indicating saturation toward either state. ATPase assays reveal increased resting ATPase activity in R403Q samples, persisting even when the ON state is saturated, suggesting that elevated energy consumption in the R403Q mutation is driven by both an ON shift and enhanced myosin ATPase activity.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Conflicting evidence implicates the endocannabinoid system in the effects of APAP. We tested the hypothesis that the analgesic effects of APAP were dependent upon both CB1 cannabinoid receptors and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL), an enzyme which catalyzes formation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. We examined the impact of APAP, administered in the presence and absence of DAGL inhibitors, on mechanical hypersensitivity in mice using models of inflammatory (induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA)) and post-surgical (induced by incisional injury) pain. Pharmacological specificity was assessed using global (Rimonabant, AM251) and peripherally restricted (AM6545) CB1 antagonists. APAP produced a dose-dependent attenuation of inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, but did not alter peripheral edema in the CFA-injected paw. APAP also attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity in mice with incisional injury. The DAGL inhibitors, RHC-80267 or DO34, attenuated the anti-allodynic effects of APAP in both models of pain. CB1 receptor antagonists (Rimonabant and/or AM251) suppressed the antinociceptive effect of APAP in both pain models. The peripherally-restricted CB1 antagonist AM6545 did not alter the anti-allodynic effects of APAP. We also assessed the impact of APAP on tail-flick antinociception, locomotor behavior, and body temperature. APAP produced hypothermia and hypolocomotion at the highest dose, but these effects were not blocked by RHC-80267 or AM251. APAP did not produce tail flick antinociception. Our studies demonstrate that the analgesic effects of APAP observed in mouse models of pathological pain require both DAGL and CB1 activation.

Defining the biology of protective versus pathogenic T cell responses in the lungs of humans will be critical to nominate novel approaches to improve respiratory health. Previous studies have examined T cells from the lungs captured via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endobronchial brushings, or biopsies. However, whether these different approaches are capturing distinct T cell phenotypes and/or clonotypes remains unclear. Objective: To evaluate and compare the transcriptional signatures of T cells isolated via BAL versus endobronchial brushings in healthy controls (HCs) and allergic asthmatics (AAs). Methods: Flexible bronchoscopy was performed to obtain BAL and endobronchial brushings from 3 HC and 3 AA subjects. CD3+ T cells were sorted and single cell RNA- and T cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing was performed using the 10X Chromium platform. Unbiased clustering, differential gene expression analysis and TCR repertoire analysis was performed. Results: Unbiased clustering analysis allowed us to define 7 CD8 and 6 CD4 T cell subsets. The most significant difference in T cell subsets abundance between AAs and HCs was the enrichment of CD4 T helper type 2 (Th2) cells when comparing endobronchial brush samples (OR=26.2, P=0.002), but not when examining BAL (OR=1.7, P=0.46), indicating differences in the T cell subsets captured from the BAL versus airway mucosa specimen processing. In further support of this observation, comparing the BAL and brush T cells across all subjects revealed an up-regulation of resident-memory T cell markers (i.e. ITGAE, CD69) in brush T cells versus BAL T cells in both CD4 and CD8 lineages. In contrast, BAL CD8 and CD4 T cells exhibited an enriched type I and II interferon signatures compared to brush T cells. Lastly, TCR repertoire analysis revealed that brush T cells contained dramatically expanded TCR clones. Expanded T cell clones from the brush expressed high levels of resident-memory markers, suggesting the airway mucosa is enriched for TRM cells with unique TCR specificity. Conclusions: Sampling T cells via BAL versus airway brushings yielded distinct T cell phenotypes and clonotypes with important implications for future research in lung immunology.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing, we removed PfMSP2 from two different P. falciparum lines with no impact on parasite replication or phenotype in vitro, demonstrating that it is not essential for RBC invasion. However, loss of PfMSP2 led to increased inhibitory potency of antibodies targeting other merozoite proteins involved in invasion, particularly PfAMA1.

The results show that the sensitivity of laboratory assays for PS was relatively consistent but manifested significant variation with strain. Phenol-sulfuric acid determination was highly variable unless the PS was pre-digested with HCl, suggesting that differences in the structural complexity of the polysaccharide could affect timing and intensity of the colorimetric reaction. Serological assays were the most sensitive, but these showed the most strain-to-strain variation on the threshold of PS detection consistent with antigenic differences. Differences in the reactivity of LFA and CLAA for cryptococcal PS from different strains imply that comparable cryptococcal antigen titers could reflect different concentrations of PS in bodily fluids.

When faced with selection pressure like antifungal exposure, this hidden genetic diversity can provide a reservoir of adaptive mutations through loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events. Validating the potential phenotypic impact of LOH events observed in clinical or experimentally evolved strains can be difficult due to the challenge of precisely targeting one allele over the other. Here, we show that a CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to overcome this challenge. By designing allele-specific guide RNA sequences, we can induce targeted, directed LOH events, which we validate by whole-genome long-read sequencing. Using this approach, we efficiently recapitulate a recently described LOH event that increases resistance to the antifungal fluconazole. Additionally, we find that the recombination tracts of these induced LOH events have similar lengths to those observed naturally.

We explored the use of open-pollinated (OP) genetic mapping as an alternative to conventional bi-parental QTL mapping and genome wide association studies (GWAS). A QTL was simulated and the performance of a mixed linear model (MLM) and a multi-locus mixed model (MLMM) in QTL mapping accuracy was compared using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) dataset of seven interspecific Royal Gala x M. sieversii bi-parental F1 populations.

Analysis of power indicated that a population size of 137 individuals is required to reach an  = 0.8 for a simulated major effect QTL. Mapping resolution analysis showed that a population size of 470-600 individuals, depending on local recombination rates, is necessary to achieve high resolution within the OP population.

Omics datasets, with their high dimensionality and relatively small sample sizes, often lead to overfitting, especially in deep learning models. Generative models offer a promising way to generate realistic synthetic data preserving the original data distribution. However, there is still no objective consensus on how to evaluate their performance. In this study, we set out to validate generative networks for transcriptomics data generation by using statistical distances as robust evaluation metrics. Results. We observe that statistical distances enable simultaneous evaluation of global and local data fidelity of generated synthetic data. Because these distances satisfy the properties of true metrics, they also enable formal hypothesis testing to assess whether generative models have in fact converged or are merely approaching the reference distribution. Crucially, optimizing for these distances was found to implicitly select models maximizing other widely used metrics of generative performance, providing evidence of their broad applicability. Overall, our findings indicate that the adoption of these metrics can play a key role in guiding the development of generative models across a wide range of domains.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

POPARI jointly learns spatial metagenes - linear gene expression programs - and their spatial affinities across samples. Its key innovations include a differential prior to regularize spatial accordance and spatial downsampling to enable multi-resolution, hierarchical analysis. Simulations show POPARI outperforms existing methods on multisample and multiresolution spatial metrics. Applications to real datasets uncover spatial metagene dynamics, spatial accordance, and cell identities. In mouse brain (STARmap PLUS), POPARI identifies spatial metagenes linked to AD; in thymus (Slide-TCR-seq), it captures increasing colocalization of V(D)J recombination and T cell proliferation; and in ovarian cancer (CosMx), it reveals sample-specific malignant-immune interactions.

However, a systematic quantitative link between anatomical markers of the cortical hierarchy and single-neuron dynamics has not yet been established. Here, we hypothesise that the single-neuron spontaneous spiking statistics uniquely characterise each cortical area, and that they quantitatively correlate with the cortical hierarchy. We consider the spontaneous activity of neurons in seven cortical areas (V1, V4, DP, 7A, M1, PMd, PFC) in macaques in the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. First, we show that the firing rate, inter-spike interval variation, and cross-correlation form a unique fingerprint of the cortical areas, but only when considering them in combination. Second, we find that the differences between the spiking statistics strongly correlate with multiple anatomical markers of the cortical hierarchy, especially in the eyes-closed condition. We also observe a correlation between autocorrelation timescales and the anatomical hierarchy, consistent with previous findings. In conclusion, we demonstrate that spontaneous single-neuron spiking activity reflects the hierarchical organisation of the cerebral cortex: distinct spiking statistics for hierarchically distant areas; similar statistics for nearby areas. Our results thus add a new dynamical dimension to the concept of the cortical hierarchy.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the contribution of somatostatin neurotransmission in differentiating between salient (rewarding or aversive) and neutral outcomes. Monitoring somatostatin release and somatostatin receptor antagonism revealed time-dependent regulation of outcome-specific associative learning during acquisition. We found that somatostatin transmission enables configural representations incorporating a salient, aversive outcome in prefrontal cortical neurons, and a threat-driven shift in population-level network activity in-vivo. These findings show a novel role for somatostatin, an interneuron 'cellular marker', signaling in shaping learning and emergent network dynamics.

The signalling molecules that mediate inhibitory TIGIT signalling in T cells remain poorly defined, and it is not clear how TIGIT activation is regulated. Here, proximity proteomics was employed in Jurkat T cells to identify TIGIT-associating proteins upon engagement with its ligand CD155. This identified several ligation-specific TIGIT interactors, including proteins involved in signalling (Grb2 and SOS1), cytoskeletal regulation (CD2AP and SdcBP), and endocytosis (IST1 and SNX3). A TIGIT mutant (Y225A/Y231A) incapable of signalling via its inhibitory motifs prevented the recruitment of these proteins, indicating inhibitory signalling-specific engagement of these pathways. Strikingly, T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation was also needed for TIGIT to engage with these pathways. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of TIGIT required both CD155 ligation and TCR activation, which resulted in signalling and internalisation. These findings demonstrate that TIGIT signalling is context-dependent and restricted to T cells receiving simultaneous TCR activation. This establishes a regulatory mechanism that limits checkpoint control to when functionally required.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

The treatment of T5 significantly enhanced plant growth parameters, including plant height, number of leaves, and number of branches, alongside a substantial increase in yield (12.71 tons/ha), which was statistically similar to T6. These bio-organic amendments not only suppressed disease incidence effectively but also improved soil health, enhanced microbial diversity, and promoted vegetative growth and yield.

N.; Catta-Preta, R.; Cepko, C. L.", "abstract": "Precise gene regulation is essential for the development and function of complex tissues, yet comprehensive mapping of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) remains challenging due to limitations in throughput, resolution, and the ability to assay within specific cell types. Here, we introduce two complementary approaches--a locus-specific massively parallel reporter assay (LS-MPRA) and a degenerate MPRA (d-MPRA)--specifically designed to address some of these shortcomings. LS-MPRA leverages bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to generate high-complexity libraries spanning large genomic regions, enabling unbiased interrogation of millions of DNA fragments potentially relevant for the regulation of a specific gene or set of genes. The d-MPRA employs systematic mutagenesis to resolve the functional architecture of CRMs at nucleotide resolution, thereby nominating critical nucleotides as potential TF binding sites, or for other regulatory roles. We applied these methods to retinal genes that are stably expressed in differentiated cells of the retina, in rod photoreceptors and in subsets of bipolar interneurons, using both in vivo and ex vivo preparations of mouse tissue. LS-MPRA recapitulated some of the known CRMs for these genes?such as the proximal promoter region of Rho--and identified potentially novel CRMs, including those located within neighboring genes. The method was then applied to a gene that is dynamically expressed in subsets of retinal progenitor cells, Olig2, where it identified three distinct CRM regions (Olig2-NR1, NR2, and NR3). D-MPRA and subsequent motif analyses nominated critical TF binding sites within these regions. CUT&RUN experiments confirmed direct binding of these candidates. Moreover, extending LS-MPRA to chick retina and spinal cord demonstrated the applicability of these methods across species and tissues. Together, the integrated LS-MPRA and d-MPRA strategies provide a robust, high-resolution platform for discovery of the cis-regulatory code underlying tissue-specific gene expression. It does not require prior knowledge of potential CRMs, and is quite rapid and straightforward to deploy, using typical molecular biology methods. The fragment size can be scaled to create short CRMs, e.g. for cell type-specific expression within viral vectors. It should enable CRM discovery at a scale and affordability for laboratories wishing to focus on a particular locus or set of loci.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

Adult FSCs can become proliferative Follicle Cells (FCs) to the posterior, or quiescent Escort Cells (ECs) to the anterior. Graded extracellular Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signals emanate from cells anterior to FSCs (Cap Cells and ECs) to guide these behaviors together with an inverse JAK-STAT pathway stimulated by ligand from a more posterior source (polar FCs). Here we used lineage analyses to investigate the role of those signals in the development of ECs, FSCs and FCs from a common set of precursors during pupation. Previous studies found that the most anterior precursors divide slowest, with quiescence spreading to all future ECs from the anterior, FSCs are specified simply by their location at eclosion, and the first FCs derive from a group of cells that accumulates posterior to the developing germline over the first 48h of pupation. We now show that the latter cells derive from migration of precursors out of the developing germarium. We also found that Wnt pathway activity favored conversion of precursors to more anterior adult derivatives, while JAK-STAT pathway activity favored posterior outcomes. Wnt pathway activity increased over the first 48h and maintained a graded pattern throughout pupation, terminating at the anterior extent of FC specification, commensurate with Wnt pathway activity continuously opposing FC formation. JAK-STAT pathway activity was consistently lowest in anterior cells, indicating a posterior source early in pupation prior to formation of the first polar FCs. Precursor division was promoted by JAK-STAT signaling and also by Hh signaling, acting through transcriptional induction of yorkie. Faster division favored a precursor becoming an FSC, as seen for FSC lineage maintenance in adults.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

In yeast and vertebrates PDS5 can lead to cohesin establishment or disassembly, depending on its interaction with other proteins. In this study, we explored the diversity of PDS5 proteins across eukaryotes; HEAT-repeats forming a hook-like structure (PDS5 domain), followed by a predicted disordered region of variable lengths, are observed across the Tree of Life. Interestingly, two homolog types (A and B) with signs of varying chromatin localization emerged independently in later branches of animal and plant kingdoms, in vertebrates and vascular plants, respectively (~400-500 MYA). We also investigated the emergence of two plant-specific features in the PDS5 proteins: 1.) An ancestral acquisition of a Tudor domain with conserved H3K4me1-binding amino acids in land plants 2.) A truncated version of PDS5 proteins that lacks essential features of PDS5 domain and is involved in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) plant-specific pathway which emerged in seed plants.

We find that the DFE co-varies with phylogeny, where the expected mutation effects are more similar in closely related species (Pagel's {lambda} = 0.84, P = 0.01). Additionally, mammals have a higher proportion of strongly deleterious mutations (22% to 47% in mammals; 0.0% to 5.4% in insects and birds) and a lower proportion of weakly deleterious mutations than insects and birds. Population size is significantly negatively correlated with the expected impact of new deleterious mutations (PGLS{lambda}, P = 0.03), and the proportion of new beneficial mutations (r2 = 0.73, P < 0.001). These findings align with Fisher's Geometric Model (FGM), which defines organismal complexity as the number of phenotypes under selection. Consistent with the FGM's predictions, we observe that mutations are more deleterious in complex organisms, while beneficial mutations occur more frequently in smaller populations to compensate for the drift load.

Read mapping, the process of aligning reads to a reference genome, is central to many applications, including variant detection and comparative genomics. While several tools have been developed for this task, genomic reproducibility1, defined as the consistency of results across replicates, remains underexplored. Here, we address this question by introducing a methodology based on synthetic replicates of sequencing data, generated by perturbing the original reads through shuffling, reverse complementing, or combined shuffling and reverse complementing. Our approach is able to simulate variability observed across sequencing runs due to differences in library preparation techniques. We evaluated the reproducibility of eight alignment tools (BWA-MEM22, Bowtie23, HISAT24, minimap25, NextGenMap6, SNAP7, SMALT7,8 and Subread9) under these perturbations using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Synthetic replicates were aligned and compared to the original sample to quantify discrepancies. Mapping accuracy changes ranged from 0.0001% to 4.4% for primary reads, which are alignments not marked as secondary, supplementary, or duplicates, and up to 12.2% for high-quality primary reads. For primary reads, the percentage of reads commonly mapped in both the original and synthetic replicate ranged from 91.66% to 100% relative to the total number of mapped reads in the original dataset. High-quality filtering improved consistency, though some tools still failed to recover more than 70% of the original alignments. Within the set of common reads, the incidence of inconsistent mappings was as high as 13.53% for primary reads and 6.73% for high-quality primary reads. Bowtie 2 was fully reproducible under the shuffling replicate, Subread was fully reproducible under the reverse-complement replicate, whereas NextGenMap exhibited only minor inconsistencies. By contrast, SNAP and minimap2 displayed the most significant variability under reverse complementing. We further demonstrate that alignment inconsistencies propagate to the downstream task of calling structural genomic variants. Using Manta for structural-variant (SV) calling, we observed that Bowtie2, HISAT2, and minimap2 maintained perfect SV concordance between original and replicate alignments, whereas other tools exhibited lower concordance, with Subread scoring only 87% concordance. In conclusion, our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that synthetic perturbations reveal critical differences in how alignment tools handle technical variability and how these differences propagate to downstream variant analyses, underscoring the necessity of incorporating reproducibility benchmarks into the selection and validation of read mappers to ensure robust and reliable genomic interpretations.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

This kind of flexibility depends not just on having prior experience, but on how that experience was structured in the first place. The design of early training curriculum is especially important: poorly structured experiences can hinder abstraction and limit generalization, while carefully structured training promotes more flexible and adaptive behavior. Yet, the neural mechanisms supporting this process remain unclear. To investigate how early training shapes learning we first trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on variants of an odor-timing task previously used to study complex timing behavior in mice. We then tested the RNN predictions on how previous experience affects generalization using behavioral and electrophysiological recordings in mice trained on the same task using staged training sequences. RNNs and mice trained without well-structured early experience developed rigid strategies and made repeated errors. In contrast, those given more balanced early training were better able to generalize and showed similar neural activity patterns that reflected the task's underlying temporal structure. Using dynamical systems approaches, we reveal a mechanism for this effect: networks trained with appropriately structured curricula developed distinct dynamical motifs that support the correct abstractions when complexity was increased. Networks that lacked early training or received remedial curricula developed single fixed-point solutions that failed to generalize beyond the training stimuli. Together, these findings demonstrate that it is not just the presence of prior experience, but its structure, that governs how flexible and generalizable knowledge emerges in both biological systems and computational models.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

W.; Gramfort, A.; van Wassenhove, V.", "abstract": "Timing, that is estimating, comparing, or remembering how long events last, requires the temporary storage of durations. How durations are stored in working memory is unknown, despite the widely held view of memory systems' central role in timing. Here, we investigated the neural signatures of a sequence of durations (n-item sequence) held in working memory. We recorded human participants using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they performed an n-item delayed reproduction task, which required to encode a sequence of durations, maintain it, and then reproduce it. The number of items in a sequence (one or three) and the duration of the sequence were orthogonalized. Our results show that during working memory maintenance, the number of durations, not the duration of the sequence, affected recall precision and could be decoded from alpha and beta oscillatory activity. Parieto-occipital alpha power showed a direct link with the precision of temporal reproduction. Our results extend earlier behavioral findings suggesting that durations are itemized in working memory and that their number, not their duration, modulates recall precision (Herbst et al., 2025). Crucially, we establish that alpha power reflects a universal signature of working memory load and mediates recall precision, even for abstract information such as duration.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Prefrontal neurons can have diverse activity during cognitive functions like working memory, attention, and timing; however, the importance of this heterogeneity is unclear. Our goal was to better understand the diversity of prefrontal activity through connectivity. We harnessed circuit-specific tools to capture activity within prefrontal projections during interval timing, an elementary cognitive process that requires working memory for temporal rules and attention to the passage of time to estimate a temporal interval of several seconds. We used human electroencephalography and single neuronal recordings in mice to capture prefrontal activity during interval timing, with major patterns characterized by time-dependent ramping (monotonic changes) over a temporal interval. We then leveraged retrograde viruses to interrogate prefrontal cortex (PFC) projections to the mediodorsal thalamus (PFC-MD) and to the dorsomedial striatum (PFC-DMS). We report three novel results. First, circuit-specific calcium fiber photometry revealed that PFC-MD and PFC-DMS activity encoded distinct temporal signals, with PFC-MD projections ramping down and PFC-DMS ramping up to interval timing response times. Second, circuit-specific inactivation revealed that PFC-DMS inactivation disrupted animals internal estimates of time. Third, circuit-specific single-nucleus RNA sequencing of prefrontal projections revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles between PFC-MD and PFC-DMS projections, with enriched genes for cortical layers and neuromodulators, and specific genes such as Cux2, Camk2n1, Htr4, and Foxp2. These data suggest differences in gene expression and connectivity give rise to the diversity of prefrontal activity during interval timing. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of prefrontal function and dysfunction in human disease.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), a leading cause of severe infections, becomes increasingly resistant to antibiotics, including the last resort antibiotic, polymyxin-B (PMB). Previous studies have shown that calcium (Ca2+) at the levels encountered during infections increases Pa resistance to PMB. However, the mechanisms of this Ca2+ regulation are not known. Here, we identified three novel genes (PA2803, PA3237 and PA5317) that contribute to the Ca2+-dependent PMB resistance in Pa. PA2803, the focus of this work, encodes a putative phosphonatase and is a founding member of the PA2803 subfamily from the Haloacid Dehalogenase Superfamily. Since the transcription of this gene is regulated by both Ca2+ and inorganic phosphate (Pi), we named it \"Pi and Ca2+ regulated protein, PcrP\". Congruent with sequence-based predictions, we showed that PcrP lacks catalytic activity and instead binds protein partners, revealing a novel non-catalytic function for PA2803 subfamily proteins. By using pull-down assays and bacterial two-hybrid system, we identified and validated two protein partners of PcrP: Acp3 and PA3518. We show that PcrP is involved in oxidative stress responses in Pa, which are likely mediated by its interactions with Acp3, and may support its role in PMB resistance. In addition, PcrP imparts a Ca2+-dependent growth advantage to Pa during Pi starvation and plays a role in polyphosphate accumulation in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Overall, this study identified a novel protein-binding function for the PA2803 subfamily representative that mediates Pa responses to elevated Ca2+ and Pi starvation and enhances PMB resistance.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Hadfield, J. D.", "abstract": "The rate of adaptation is equal to the additive genetic variance for relative fitness VA in the population. Estimating VA typically involves measuring fitness proxies on a large number of individuals from a known pedigree. Such data are hard to collect and the results are often sensitive to the definition of fitness used. Here, we present a new method for estimating VA that does not involve making measurements of fitness proxies on individuals, but instead tracks changes in the genetic composition of the population. First, we show that VA can readily be expressed as a function of the genome-wide diversity/linkage disequilibrium matrix and genome-wide expected change in allele frequency due to selection. We then show how independent experimental replicates can be used to infer the expected change in allele frequency due to selection and then estimate VA via a linear mixed model. Finally, using individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that our approach yields precise and unbiased estimates over a range of biologically plausible levels of VA.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": ""}
