However, it is unclear how post-HI hypothermia helps to restore the balance, as cooling reduces CMRO2. Also, how transient HI leads to secondary energy failure (SEF) in neonatal brains remains elusive. Using photoacoustic microscopy, we examined the effects of HI on CMRO2 in awake 10-day-old mice, supplemented by bioenergetic analysis of purified cortical mitochondria. Our results show that while HI suppresses ipsilateral CMRO2, it sparks a prolonged CMRO2-surge post-HI, associated with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, superoxide emission, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential necessary for ATP synthesis, indicating oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) uncoupling. Post-HI hypothermia prevents the CMRO2-surge by constraining oxygen extraction fraction, reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress, and maintains ATP and N-acetylaspartate levels, resulting in attenuated infarction at 24 hours post-HI. Our findings suggest that OXPHOS-uncoupling induced by the post-HI CMRO2-surge underlies SEF and blocking the surge is a key mechanism of hypothermia protection. Also, our study highlights the potential of optical CMRO2-measurements for detecting neonatal HI brain injury and guiding the titration of therapeutic hypothermia at the bedside.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

However, their practical adoption for forecasting purposes remains limited due to difficulties in calibrating them against data and structural inaccuracies in their mathematical formulations. While ecological time series could, in principle, be used to directly estimate model parameters and refine model structures, the large noise levels in ecological datasets and the strong nonlinearity of ecological dynamics challenge conventional calibration methods. Here, we present a robust and scalable calibration framework that addresses these challenges by integrating techniques from scientific computing and deep learning. Our approach combines a segmentation strategy where state variables are estimated independently, differentiable programming for efficient gradient computation, parameter transformations to ensure the feasibility and stability of the model simulations, and mini-batching to accomodate large datasets. Through comprehensive benchmarks using simulated food web dynamics of increasing complexity, we demonstrate that the framework substantially improves the convergence of gradient descent algorithms and Monte Carlo sampling methods, accommodating for realistic scenarios with noisy and partial observations. This yields improved parameter estimation and forecasts within both mode estimation and full posterior distribution contexts. Crucially, we show that the calibration framework scales effectively with both the number of parameters and state variables. The improved convergence and scalability of the calibration framework enables hybrid modeling approaches, where neural networks parameterize complex processes within the dynamic model. In particular, we demonstrate that neural networks can effectively capture environmental dependencies in demographic rates and recover functional responses governing trophic interactions. Neural network-based parameterizations have the capability to improve the structural inaccuracies of models while maintaining ecological interpretability through post-hoc analysis of learned representations. We provide an implementation of the calibration framework and other key utilities as the open-source Julia package HybridDynamicModels.jl, with the hope that the package will facilitate the development of hybrid modeling approaches in quantitative ecology and related fields.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

We have previously shown that NR4A3 deficiency induces an early molecular program that promotes memory generation and enhances effector functions, which are two essential attributes for the success of adoptive cell therapy (ACT). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that Nr4a3-/- CD8+ T cells would have outstanding efficacy in ACT of cancer. Our results show that ACT of melanoma-bearing mice with Nr4a3-/- effector CD8+ T cells provides a better tumor control than their wild-type counterpart. The therapeutic effect observed with Nr4a3-/- effector CD8+ T cells is even better than the one observed with ACT of Nr4a3+/+ effector CD8+ T cells in combination with anti-PD-L1 treatment. scRNA-seq analysis reveals a huge heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) states following ACT. The better tumor control observed with ACT of Nr4a3-/- CD8+ effectors without anti-PD-L1 treatment correlates with an enrichment of TILs within the clusters that are associated with the anti-PD-L1 response of wild-type TILs. Moreover, the clusters that are enriched in Nr4a3-/- TILs are the ones that are enriched for effector functions. Furthermore, Nr4a3-/- and Nr4a3+/+ effectors generate distinct progenitor populations. Pseudotime analysis suggests that these progenitors have different differentiation trajectories, which may explain why ACT with Nr4a3-/- effectors is more efficient. Therefore, modulation of NR4A3 activity may represent a new strategy to generate long-lived and highly functional T cells for ACT.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

AHR is implicated in numerous physiological processes, including liver and immune function, cell cycle control, oncogenesis, and metabolism. Traditionally, AHR binds a consensus DNA sequence (GCGTG), the xenobiotic response element (XRE), recruits coregulators, and modulates gene expression. Yet, recent evidence suggests AHR can also regulate gene expression via a non-consensus sequence (GGGA), termed the non-consensus XRE (NC-XRE). The prevalence and functional significance of NC-XRE motifs in the genome have remained unclear. While ChIP and reporter studies hinted at AHR-NC-XRE interactions, direct evidence for transcriptional regulation in a native context was lacking. In this study, we analyzed AHR binding to NC-XRE sequences genome-wide in mouse liver, integrating ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to identify candidate AHR target genes containing NC-XRE motifs in their regulatory regions. We found NC-XRE motifs in 82% of AHR-bound DNA, significantly enriched compared to random regions, and present in promoters and enhancers of AHR targets. Functional genomics on the Serpine1 gene revealed that deleting NC-XRE motifs reduced TCDD-induced Serpine1 upregulation, demonstrating direct regulation. These findings provide the first direct evidence for AHR-mediated regulation via NC-XRE in a natural genomic context, advancing our understanding of AHR-bound DNA and its impact on gene expression and physiological relevance.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we discover and characterize a novel series of compounds that potently and selectively inhibit SMARCA4/SMARCA2. Mutational and biochemical studies demonstrate that these inhibitors act through a unique mode of inhibition, distinct from reported SMARCA4/SMARCA2 inhibitors. Across a range of cancer cell lines, SMARCA4/SMARCA2 inhibition resulted in lineage-specific changes in chromatin accessibility at binding sites for key transcription factors (TFs). In uveal melanoma (UM), BAF inhibition resulted in loss of enhancer occupancy of SOX10 and MITF, two essential TFs, leading to down-regulation of the melanocytic gene expression program.

Two subcomplexes of core proteins segregate to opposite sides of the cell, defining a polarity axis. Homodimers of the atypical cadherin Flamingo are thought to be the scaffold upon which these subcomplexes assemble and are required for intercellular polarity signaling. The central role for Flamingo homodimers in scaffolding and intercellular communication suggests that cells in which intercellular signaling via Flamingo is disabled should fail to polarize. We show that cells lacking Flamingo, or bearing a truncated Flamingo that cannot homodimerize do in fact polarize.

Open-source mixed model routines are available but do not account for complex covariance structures or are extremely slow to fit big/dense genomic models. The lme4breeding R package was developed as an extension of the lme4 package and allows correlated random effects and complex covariance structures to be fitted for responses with different distributions. The correlation between levels of the random effect (e.g., individuals) is accounted for by eigen-decomposing the relationship matrix and post-multiplying the incidence matrix of the levels of this random factor by the Cholesky decomposition of the corresponding (co)variance matrix (eigen values) and the response by the eigen vectors. For big genomic models the eigen decomposition of relationship matrices coupled with sparse matrix solvers presents a massive increase in speed compared to dense formulations used in other popular software and the same level of accuracy is achieved.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

While mRNA methylation such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) that has been widely studied in memory, the role of mRNA acetylation remains largely unknown. N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), the only known form of RNA acetylation in eukaryotes, promotes mRNA stability and translation. In this study, we identified the ac4C epitranscriptome in mouse hippocampal homogenates and synaptosomes through ac4C-RNA immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (acRIP-seq). The Morris water maze (MWM) was employed to induce and evaluate memory acquisition and forgetting processes. We show that synaptic ac4C levels are dynamically regulated, increasing after memory formation and returning to baseline after natural forgetting. The dynamic changes of ac4C-mRNAs regulated by memory were validated by ac4C dot-blot, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and acRIP-qPCR analysis. We further demonstrate that NAT10, the ac4C writer, in mouse hippocampus is important for spatial memory via regulating memory-related mRNAs, proteins, and ultimately synaptic plasticity. Lastly, we generated a freely-accessible website (http://ac4catlas.com) that included the dataset of ac4C epitranscriptome in mouse hippocampus.

We experimentally compared nest excavation in colonies seeded from a single mated queen and allowed to grow for six months to excavation triggered by a catastrophic event in colonies with fixed demographics, where the age of each worker, including the queen, is known. The areas excavated by equal group sizes differed significantly between these conditions: heterogeneous populations in naturally growing colonies as well as cohorts of young ants dig larger areas than old ant cohorts. Moreover, we find that younger ants tend to dig slanted tunnels while older ants dig straight down. This is a novel form of age polyethism, where an ant's age dictates not only her likelihood to engage in a task but also the way she performs the task. We further present a quantitative model that predicts that under normal growth, digging is predominantly performed by the younger ants while after a catastrophe all ants dig to restore lost nest volume. The fact that the nests of naturally growing colonies exhibit slanted tunnels strengthens this prediction.

Using RNA interference, nlg3 knockdown in the OL increased fly social space, especially in the males, while knocking down nlg3 independently in the MB or the PB did not change social spacing. However, hyperactivation and silencing of these neurons in the MB, but not the PB, controls social space in males and females, while hyperactivating and silencing of all nlg3-expressing neurons, including within the MB, PB, and OL, regulates male and female social space.

We address this question by mapping the fitness effects of over 9,000 natural variants in the Ras/PKA and TOR/Sch9 pathways--key regulators of cell proliferation in eukaryotes--across four conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While most variants are neutral in our assay, ~3,500 exhibited significant fitness effects. These non-neutral variants tend to be missense and to affect conserved, more densely packed, and less solvent-exposed protein regions. While some of these non-neutral variants are younger and rarer, and more often found in heterozygous states--consistent with purifying selection--a substantial fraction is present at high frequencies in the population, which is expected under balancing selection. Indeed, we find that variants with a positive fitness effect in our laboratory measurement show strong signs of local adaptation as they tend to be found specifically in domesticated strains isolated from human-made environments. Our findings support the view that while many common variants might be effectively neutral, a significant proportion have locally adaptive functional consequences and are driven into a subset of the population by local positive selection.

Here, we use the SunTag reporter system to quantitatively examine the spatiotemporal profile of bcd mRNA translation in vivo. We show that association with Processing bodies (P bodies) in mature oocytes prevent premature bcd mRNA translation. Following egg activation, bcd mRNA dissociates from P bodies and translation is observed at the anterior pole. Translation remains restricted to the anterior domain throughout early development, even after nuclear migration in the syncytial blastoderm. At cellularisation, translation ceases and the remaining bcd mRNA associates with reformed P bodies, which appear to block any further translation. We use these observations to create a new modified source-diffusion-degradation model of Bcd gradient formation that has spatiotemporally varying production. Overall, our study reveals that bcd mRNA translation is tightly controlled in space and time during oogenesis and early embryogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Using cytology and CUT&Tag chromatin profiling, we find that histone H4 uniquely occupies histone gene promoters in both Drosophila and human cells. Our results suggest that repression of histone genes by soluble histone H4 is a conserved mechanism that coordinates DNA replication with histone synthesis in proliferating cells.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

The system is built around the Opentrons OT-2 liquid handling robot and incorporates a novel on-deck imaging-based cell counting instrument which allows it to compensate for density disparities across a source plate and control the number of cells seeded on a per-well basis. We find this solution compares favorably to our existing manual cell culture processes in terms of both accuracy and biological outcomes while cutting the hands-on time required per plate by more than half.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most serious types of DNA damage, as they lead to loss of genetic information and death when not repaired. In E. coli, they are recognised and processed by the RecBCD complex, which initiates repair by homologous recombination. Although the repair dynamics downstream of RecBCD has been well characterised, it is still unclear how long this complex stays attached to DNA and what triggers its dissociation in vivo. To answer these questions, we imaged RecB at the single-molecule level, and quantified its dynamic behaviour in bacterial cells exposed to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that induces DSBs. Our results show that RecB forms long-lived complexes with DSBs (10 seconds), and that its dissociation from DNA is an intrinsic property of the complex, that does not depend on the amount of DNA damage, nor the following steps in the repair pathway. Moreover, we show that we can use RecB binding to DSBs as a marker to estimate the rate of damage formation. This study provides a detailed quantitative insight into the interaction of RecBCD with DNA double-strand ends in E. coli in vivo, and into the bacterial response to DSBs induced by ciprofloxacin.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

A.; Boulesteix, M.; Fablet, M.; Vieira, C.", "abstract": "In Drosophila, like in many other animal species, females tend to live longer than males, a phenomenon known as sex gap in longevity (SGL). One possible explanation for this phenomenon could be related to the activity of transposable elements (TE), which may be present at higher levels in the heterogametic sex. TE activity is normally repressed by epigenetic mechanisms, but this regulation weakens with age. Sex chromosomes, such as the Y chromosome, are enriched in TEs, and age-related TE activity may therefore be more pronounced in older males than in older females, likely affecting longevity patterns. Using three Drosophila species, we show that SGL varies naturally among wild-type populations, reflecting both intra- and inter-species differences. Transcriptomic data revealed increased age-related TE expression in D. melanogaster and D. suzukii flies, but not in D. simulans. Moreover, we observed a higher number of upregulated TE copies in older males compared to older females across all the three species tested. Additionally, we detected an increase in TE-chimeric transcript generation in some aged samples, particularly in D. suzukii males. Finally, the replacement of the Y chromosome between strains with different SGL led to a progressive reduction in male lifespan and increased TE transcriptional release over generations, suggesting a Y chromosome important role in male longevity. Our work highlights the importance of investigating the role of TEs to better understand differences in longevity between sexes and across different species.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

The Sc chromosome of interest was circularized, genetically modified to carry Km centromeres and replication origins, and transformed into Km via protoplast transformation. Using this method, we generated two synthetic strains, each containing a full set of Km chromosomes and either Sc chromosome I or III. The Sc chromosomes exhibited normal replication, segregation, and active transcription after the transfer. The synthetic strains displayed enhanced phenotypes in flocculation and salt tolerance, which were found to be caused by transgressive expression of FLO9 and SPS22 on the transferred Sc chromosomes, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that transgressive expression was prevalent among the transferred Sc genes, suggesting evolution of lineage-specific cis- and trans-regulatory interactions across a long evolutionary timescale.

It is unclear, however, how these distinct attentional signals interact and contribute in visual environments that are more akin to natural scanning, when stimuli may change rapidly and no fixation requirements are imposed. Here, we investigate this via a gamified task in which participants (male and female) make continuous saccadic choices at a rapid pace --- and yet, perceptual performance can be accurately tracked over time as the choice process unfolds. The results reveal unequivocal markers of exogenous capture toward salient stimuli; endogenous guidance toward valuable targets and relevant locations; and history-driven effects, which produce large, involuntary modulations in processing capacity. Under dynamic conditions, success probability is dictated by temporally precise interplay between different forms of spatial attention, with recent history making a particularly prominent contribution.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

SpARC-map uses only routine microbiology techniques, with no reliance on specialized instrumentation, dedicated reagents, or reconstituting protein complexes in vitro. SpARC-map can be tuned to detect PPIs over a broad range of affinities, multiplexed to probe multiple PPIs in parallel, and its nonspecific background can be precisely measured, enabling the sensitive detection of weak PPIs.

Mitochondrial structure is of growing interest in cancer biology due to its crucial role in regulating the multi-faceted functions of mitochondria. We and others have established the crucial role of mitochondria in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited therapeutic options. Building upon our previous work demonstrating the regulatory role of mitochondrial structure dynamics in metabolic adaptation and survival of chemotherapy-refractory TNBC cells, we sought to extend those findings to a large-scale analysis of transmission electron micrographs. Here we present a UNet artificial intelligence (AI) model for automatic annotation and assessment of mitochondrial morphology and feature quantification. Our model is trained on 11,039 manually annotated mitochondria across 125 micrographs derived from a variety of orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model tumors and adherent cell cultures. The model achieves an F1 score of 0.85 on test micrographs at the pixel level. To validate the ability of our model to detect expected mitochondrial structural features, we utilized micrographs from mouse primary skeletal muscle cells genetically modified to lack Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). The algorithm successfully detected a significant increase in mitochondrial elongation, in alignment with the well-established role of Drp1 as a driver of mitochondrial fission. Further, we subjected in vitro and in vivo TNBC models to conventional chemotherapy treatments commonly used for clinical management of TNBC, including doxorubicin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and docetaxel (DTX). We found substantial within-sample heterogeneity of mitochondrial structure in both in vitro and in vivo TNBC models and observed a consistent reduction in mitochondrial elongation in DTX-treated specimens. We went on to compare mammary tumors and matched lung metastases in a highly metastatic PDX model of TNBC, uncovering significant reduction in mitochondrial length in metastatic lesions. Our large, curated dataset provides high statistical power to detect frequent chemotherapy-induced shifts in mitochondrial shapes and sizes in residual cells left behind after treatment. The successful application of our AI model to capture mitochondrial structure marks a step forward in high-throughput analysis of mitochondrial structures, enhancing our understanding of how morphological changes may relate to chemotherapy efficacy and mechanism of action. Finally, our large, manually curated electron micrograph dataset - now publicly available - serves as a unique gold-standard resource for developing, benchmarking, and applying computational models, while further advancing investigations into mitochondrial morphology and its impact on cancer biology.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Hh signaling simultaneously promotes an undifferentiated state and induces differentiation via activation of EMT-associated transcription factors zfh1 and Mef2. As a result, overactivation of Hh signaling generates a transcriptional hybrid state comparable to epithelial-mesenchymal-transition. Co-overactivation of Hh signaling with EGFR-Ras signaling blocks differentiation and induces key characteristics of tumor cells including a loss of tissue architecture caused by reduced expression of cell adhesion molecules, sustained proliferation and an evasion of cell cycle checkpoints. These findings provide new insight into how non-interacting signaling pathways converge at the transcriptional level to prevent malignant cell behavior.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Alterations in vesicular pH, as observed in ageing and Alzheimer's disease, may influence synaptogyrin function, yet the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We compared synaptogyrin-1 (SYNGR1, pI 4.5) and synaptogyrin-3 (SYNGR3, pI 8.4), two structurally similar isoforms with distinct electrostatic properties. Using 50ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in realistic lipid bilayers at resting (pH 5.5) and active (pH 7.25) conditions, we examined how vesicular pH modulates protein conformation, membrane binding, and stability. Despite near-identical backbones (RMSD 1.27 [A]), SYNGR1 and SYNGR3 displayed divergent pH-dependent dynamics. Comparative analysis revealed that SYNGR1's resting state closely resembled the active state of SYNGR3, suggesting functional convergence during vesicle recycling. Multivariate amino acid profilling was conducted using homologous residue profiles. Consistent with epistatic potential, ClinVar-reported damaging variants in SYNGR1 clustered within regions of low structural mimicry, whereas SYNGR3 variants localized to conserved regions. These findings identify pH-dependent electrostatic modulation as a determinant of synaptogyrin behaviour and provide a framework for understanding their roles in synaptic vesicle cycling.

We found that second-order configuration stimuli elicited robust holistic effects, while featural stimuli do not, showing that such effects emerge specifically when recognition depends on configural information, but not when it relies on featural cues. We further observed that first-order configuration stimuli were also sufficient to induce holistic effects, indicating that holistic processing can emerge from multiple levels of configural information. We also found a significant correlation between individual differences in face recognition ability and holistic processing effects with the second-order configuration stimuli, but not with the first order configuration stimuli, nor the featural stimuli. Lastly, convolutional neural networks trained on the same stimuli reproduced these patterns, strengthening the interpretation that holistic processing arises when configural information must be used to recognize a stimulus.

Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs), which are produced by presenting flickering or counterphasing visual stimuli, serve as a robust tool to probe these underlying mechanisms by leveraging frequency-specific tagging of concurrently presented stimuli. We presented two overlapping counterphasing grating stimuli (plaids), either parallelly or orthogonally, at multiple contrasts and temporal frequencies and recorded spikes, local field potential, and electrocorticogram from V1 of bonnet macaques while they passively fixated.

Here, we identify melanocyte dedifferentiation as a central and reversible pathogenic mechanism in vitiligo. In healthy human skin, melanocytes reside within a basement membrane niche defined by dystroglycan-laminin-211 adhesion. In contrast, vitiligo lesions exhibit aberrant extracellular matrix remodeling, leading to an adhesion switch to integrin 3{beta}1-laminin-332 interactions. This shift promotes melanocyte dedifferentiation via Rho-F-actin-dependent activation of Hippo and MAPK pathways, resulting in c-Jun-mediated transcriptional changes. Dedifferentiated melanocytes lose their pigment-producing identity and acquire neural crest-like features with multilineage potential. Importantly, this process is reversible. Pharmacological inhibition of involved pathways restores melanocyte differentiation and induces repigmentation in both vitiligo mouse models and ex vivo patient skin.

The virions must reach their target cells through a break in the epithelial barrier. After binding to heparan sulfate (HS) of the extracellular matrix (ECM), they translocate to the cell surface and co-internalize with the entry factor CD151. The in vivo occurring translocation from the ECM to entry factors at the cell membrane may be bypassed in nonpolarized cells with low ECM secretion. To specifically investigate these early events of the infection cascade, we use polarized keratinocytes. They produce a robust ECM and have a restricted expression of entry receptors primarily to the substrate-adhered basal membrane. Virion access to the basal membrane by diffusion is strongly limited, such that translocation from the ECM is the main pathway used for infection. We block the translocation from ECM attachment sites to the cell body, release the blocking, and monitor the association of virions with CD151 or HS. We observe quick virion translocation from the ECM to the cell body within 15 min. During translocation, virions associate with the tetraspanin CD151 present at the cell border or at filopodia. Translocating virions are decorated with HS, which they lose in the next few hours, presumably prior to endocytosis. Our observations reveal a rapid step in the HPV infection cascade: the transfer of HS-coated virions from the ECM to CD151. This step is too fast to account for the asynchronous uptake of HPVs which is likely driven by glycan- and capsid processing.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Importantly, these cellular and molecular profiles not only co-localize with ICNs and FNC but also appear to support their role as intermediaries linking microscale biological substrates to cognitive function. Mediation analyses reveal that specific ICNs statistically mediate the relationship between microscale cell-type architecture and domain-specific cognitive and behavioral processes. Moreover, dynamic FNC, particularly in specific transient states, captures the mediating pathways linking cell-type and neurotransmitter similarity networks to cognitive network organization. Taken together, our findings suggest that the brain's functional architecture is systematically aligned with cellular and molecular organization, which may act as a biological constraint guiding functional network formation and shaping the neural basis of cognition.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we define three distinct transcriptional subtypes (C1, C2, C3) through integrative transcriptomic and immunogenomic profiling. C1 is characterized by hypoxia-driven pathways and an immunosuppressive microenvironment, correlating with poor prognosis. C2 exhibits a highly inflamed immune landscape with robust CD8+ T cell infiltration, suggesting potential sensitivity to immunotherapy. C3 is enriched in metabolic reprogramming pathways and displays intermediate clinical outcomes. Genetic analysis reveals subtype-specific mutational patterns, with pseudohypoxic driver mutations (SDHB, VHL, SDHA, SDHD) predominant in C1 and C3, while kinase pathway alterations (NF1, RET) define C2. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing further delineates immune ecosystem diversity. Notably, we identify ANGPT2, PCSK1N, and GPX3 as key subtype-specific biomarkers, with ANGPT2 driving tumor progression in C1 and emerging as a potential therapeutic target. Our findings provide a refined molecular classification integrating immune and genomic features, offering a framework for improved prognostication and precision therapies in PPGLs.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

W.; Renner, S. S.; Wu, Z.; Zou, Y.; Mo, L.; Ma, H.; Bucher, R.; Zohner, C.

Recent work has identified the summer solstice (21 June) as a phenological switch point, with pre-solstice warming advancing autumn phenology and post-solstice warming delaying it. However, the flexibility of this switch point remains poorly understood. We performed trans-solstice climate manipulation experiments on potted European beech (Fagus sylvatica) saplings to test (i) how spring leaf-out timing and June-August temperatures influence end-of-season timing (bud set and leaf senescence [50% loss of leaf chlorophyll content]), and (ii) whether daytime and nighttime temperatures before and after the solstice have different effects, given that trees primarily grow at night. Bud set and leaf senescence responses were tightly coupled (R2 = 0.49), with bud responses being generally stronger. Each day delay in spring leaf-out delayed bud set by 0.24 +/- 0.06 days and senescence by 0.22 +/- 0.08 days. Post-solstice full-day cooling in July delayed autumn phenology in late-leafing individuals (bud set +4.9 +/- 2.6 days; senescence +3.1 +/- 2.8 days) but had negligible impact on early-leafing trees (bud set +1.4 +/- 2.6 days; leaf senescence +2.2 +/- 2.8 days). Conversely, August full-day cooling advanced both stages. Daytime cooling before the solstice had no effect, while after the solstice it advanced autumn phenology. Nighttime cooling always delayed bud set. These findings support the Solstice-as-Phenology-Switch model and highlight the central role of developmental progression in constraining growing seasons. Faster early-season development (especially under nighttime warming) moves trees past the switch earlier, increasing sensitivity to late-season cooling and thereby triggering earlier autumn phenology. To improve growing season length projections, phenology models should account for these developmentally-mediated and diel-specific temperature responses.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

While it is evident that motor abilities deteriorate with age, it is incorrect to assume that all aspects of movement execution are equally affected. The cerebellum, a brain region that is closely involved in motor control among other functions, undergoes clear structural changes with aging. While several studies suggest that cerebellar degeneration causes age related motor control deficits, other studies suggest that the cerebellum might act as a motor reserve and compensate for its structural degeneration, leaving cerebellar motor function intact despite cerebellar degeneration. The present study aims at thoroughly investigating the impact of age on cerebellar function across an array of tasks and domains. We investigated cerebellar motor and cognitive functions across the lifespan by examining 50 young adults (20 to 35 years), 80 older adults (55 to 70 years), and 30 older old adults (over 80 years). Participants completed a test battery comprising seven motor control tasks and one cognitive task, each designed to probe cerebellar function through different paradigms. This multi task approach allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of performance patterns, providing a balanced perspective on cerebellar function across the different age groups. In addition, we analyzed outcomes from the same tasks that, while related to movement, were not specifically linked to cerebellar function. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was also conducted to assess whether cerebellar atrophy was present in the older and older old groups compared to the young. Our results revealed that, despite age-related cerebellar degeneration, cerebellar functions in older adults remained intact compared to young adults, even in adults above 80 years old. In contrast, the sensorimotor measures that were not directly linked to cerebellar function exhibited a clear pattern of decline in older adults, and were further deteriorated in the older-old adults compared to the older adults. These findings indicate that cerebellar motor control functions remain largely preserved with age, providing compelling evidence that the cerebellum possesses a remarkable degree of functional resilience and redundancy. This suggests that cerebellar circuits may be uniquely equipped to preserve function despite structural degeneration.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

While prior studies using RNA interference suggested that Ptbp1 loss promotes neurogenesis, recent genetic studies have failed to replicate glia-to-neuron conversion following Ptbp1 loss of function. To evaluate the role of Ptbp1 in developmental neurogenesis in vivo, we conditionally disrupted Ptbp1 in retinal progenitors. Ptbp1 was robustly expressed in both retinal progenitors and Muller glia but absent from postmitotic neurons, and efficient loss of function in mutant animals was confirmed using immunostaining for Ptbp1. Furthermore, bulk RNA-Seq at E16 revealed accelerated expression of late-stage progenitor and photoreceptor-specific genes and altered splicing patterns in Ptbp1 mutants, including increased inclusion of rod photoreceptor-specific exons. However, we observed no defects in retinal lamination, progenitor proliferation, or cell fate specification in mature retina. ScRNA-Seq of mature mutant retinas revealed only modest transcriptional changes which partially recapitulate alterations seen following selective deletion of Ptbp1 in mature glia. Our findings demonstrate that Ptbp1 is dispensable for retinal development and suggest that its proposed role as a central repressor of neurogenesis should be reevaluated.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

In these cases, reaction-diffusion equations provide a valuable tool to learn how new dynamics could emerge from quantitative tuning of parameters. Bringing these models into quantitative correspondence with biological data remains an outstanding challenge, especially when the data manifest heterogeneities that are difficult to account for mathematically. One particular example occurs in cell biology, where the membrane-bound regulatory protein RhoA interacts with the filamentous actin cortex in an activator-inhibitor loop. Though this core biochemical circuit is conserved across multiple cell types in different organisms, it produces different patterns of RhoA activity in different contexts, from traveling waves in starfish to transient pulses in C. elegans. To understand how this variation emerges, we develop an activator-inhibitor model that accounts explicitly for actin assembly and heterogeneity. By fitting the model to summary statistics of experimental data, subject to known parameter constraints, we show that F-actin assembly dynamics tune the spatiotemporal patterns of RhoA activity. A minimal representation of these dynamics reveals how directional transport (via polymerization) combines with stochasticity in F-actin number and orientation to produce the observed patterns. This work sheds light on how phenotypic diversity arises from heterogeneity and anisotropy, with important implications for the next generation of activator-inhibitor models.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Within this landscape, silent speech recognition (SSR) offers a powerful new interaction paradigm, enabling hands-free, private interaction while supporting individuals with speech impairments and enabling communication in noisy or sensitive environments. Recent advances in miniaturized sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated the development of more sophisticated wearable SSR systems, driven by growing demand for effortless and accessible communication. Although electrophysiological (ExG) modalities, particularly electromyography (EMG), have dominated early efforts in developing wearable SSR, critical challenges remain. Limited generalizability across users, sensor-skin interface issues, and difficulties with the comfort of use are all current roadblocks to reliable, high-fidelity signals in a wearable form factor. We propose that magnetometers offer a promising alternative to ExG and have the potential to unlock more robust, generalizable, and user-friendly SSR systems. We demonstrate that magnetometers embedded in a headphone form factor achieve a per-user SSR accuracy of 86%, significantly outperforming previously reported state-of-the-art wearable headphones combining ExG and inertial measurement units (IMUs). In addition, we show that wearable magnetometry enables generalization across individuals for SSR.

The unexpected violation of this reward expectancy can induce a negative emotion usually referred to as frustration. Frustration responses have been characterized in rodents using a reward downshift paradigm. Although an anxiogenic effect of this reward downshift has been described, the associated long term locomotor and behavioral patterns remain understudied. Furthermore, changes in the sleep preparatory behavior or in sleep per se associated with sudden reward downshift currently remain underexplored. In this study, we combined wireless electrocorticographic/electromyographic (ECoG/EMG) recordings, accelerometer and video recordings in freely behaving mice to determine sleep-wake, locomotor and behavioral patterns associated with a reward downshift paradigm. Our results show an initial increase in locomotor activity and increased latency to rest following reward devaluation. Furthermore, we found that downshifted mice displayed a reduced number of episodes of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMs) during the light phase, and increased latency to non-REMs and REMs on the first two days post-shift. Additionally, we found decreased locomotor activity and reduced nest quality over the first two days post-shift compared to unshifted animals. Our results suggest that frustration induces a transient anxiogenic effect followed by a depressive-like state. Of note, our study has the strength of using a novel approach for home-cage behavior analysis that combines machine-learning-based tracking, long-term average body acceleration, ECoG/EMG recordings, and home-cage nest quality assessment.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

In natural scenes, it is common to encounter spatially separated stimuli, such as distinct figure-ground regions, adjacent objects, and partial occlusions. Neurons in mid- and high-level visual cortex have large receptive fields (RFs) that often encompass multiple, spatially separated stimuli. It is unclear how neurons represent and segregate multiple stimuli within their RFs, and the role of spatial cues for such representation. To investigate these questions, we recorded neuronal responses in the middle temporal (MT) cortex of monkeys to spatially separated stimuli that moved simultaneously in two directions. We found that, across motion directions, response tuning to multiple stimuli was systematically biased toward the stimulus located at the more-preferred RF subregion of the neuron. The sign and magnitude of this spatial-location bias were correlated with the spatial preference of the neuron for single stimuli presented in isolation. We demonstrated that neuronal responses to multiple stimuli can be captured by an extended normalization model, which is a sum of the responses elicited by individual stimuli weighted by the spatial preference of the neuron. We also proposed a circuit implementation for the model. Our results indicate that visual neurons leverage spatial selectivity within their RFs to represent multiple spatially separated stimuli. The spatial-location bias in neuronal responses enables individual components of multiple stimuli to be represented by a population of neurons with different spatial preferences, providing a neural substrate for segregating multiple stimuli.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Here, by reanalyzing single-cell RNA-seq datasets from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we identify a shared neutrophil activation program enriched for type I interferon (IFN) signaling, nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) and AP-1 transcriptional regulators, and effector pathways including NETosis, degranulation, and leukocyte trafficking. To interrogate these signatures, we established a CRISPR-compatible neutrophil differentiation platform from adult CD34 progenitors, which yielded cells closely resembling primary neutrophils at transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional levels. A targeted CRISPR-Cas9 screen revealed a central role for the mitochondrial iron transporter mitoferrin-1 (SLC25A37) in coordinating neutrophil oxidative phosphorylation, NET formation, and type I IFN production downstream of TLR9. Mechanistically, we show that NET-derived citrullinated histones activate an autocrine IFN-IFNAR1 loop, amplifying neutrophil inflammatory functions without impairing phagocytosis. Disruption of this loop, through IFNAR1 depletion or blockade, dampened neutrophil-driven tissue damage in human intestinal and alveolar organoid co-cultures as well as in murine models of colitis and cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation. These findings uncover a conserved IFN-driven metabolic circuit in neutrophils that underpins pathology across chronic mucosal diseases and identify IFNAR1 as a therapeutic node to selectively disarm neutrophil-mediated tissue injury.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Ribosome profiling captures translatomic landscapes across conditions, but existing computational tools for differential translation analysis operate at the gene level, overlooking translational control at the level of multiple open reading frames (ORFs). Here, we present DOTSeq, a Differential ORF Translation statistical framework that enables systematic discovery of translational control events within genes. DOTSeq offers differential analyses of ORF usage and translation efficiency across biological conditions. These modules allow global detection of cis-regulatory events, such as upstream ORF (uORF)-mediated translational control. Benchmarking on simulated datasets demonstrates DOTSeq's sensitivity to subtle regulatory signals, particularly in modest effect sizes where most biological signals occur and where existing tools often show limited sensitivity.

However, certain aspects of their divisional dynamics, namely the role of quiescence and the intrinsic heterogeneity of the HSC pool, are not completely understood. High-resolution clonal tracking provides a powerful resource to investigate such dynamics as the data captures patterns of clonal persistence, dilution and late clonal emergence. Here, we apply mechanistic mathematical modeling to longitudinal clonal data from non-human primates to explore structural requirements that underlie the observed dynamical patterns. We show that models treating HSCs as a single, homogeneous population can explain the gradual loss of clonal diversity, but fail to reproduce clone size distributions and the long-term persistence of small and late-appearing clones. To address this, we propose a stochastic, two-compartment model in which HSCs transition reversibly between an actively cycling state and a quiescent, potentially niche-bound state. Compared to the simpler one-compartment model, this advanced framework provides a substantially improved fit for different metrics, consistently captures clone size distributions and explains the delayed activation and sustained coexistence of small and large clones. These results provide quantitative evidence that heterogeneity within the HSC pool, particularly the existence of a reversible quiescent state, is critical to account for clonal aspects of long-term hematopoiesis. Our findings highlight how clonal data can uncover underlying regulatory mechanisms and supports a central role for niche-mediated HSC quiescence in maintaining stable and diverse blood production over time.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Drosophila fruit flies and associated ectoparasitic mites interact across a range of microhabitats, typically in decaying organic matter, such as fallen fruit and cactus tissue, that dries out and deteriorates over periods ranging from days to months. Here, we report that mite parasitism of Drosophila increases with exposure to increasingly dry conditions for two fly-mite systems (D. nigrospiracula-Macrocheles and D. melanogaster-Gamasodes). In D. melanogaster, artificial selection for behavioral resistance did not eliminate this effect, as previously selected lines remained relatively more resistant than non-selected controls even under dry conditions. Water balance assays confirmed that mites became dehydrated when held under dry conditions, which was also associated with increased mite activity. Exposure of D. melanogaster to mites dehydrated by exposure to low relative humidity increased parasitism, further supporting that mite infestation intensifies under dry conditions. The results indicate that ectoparasitism in this system is affected by the water content of the mites. The increased motivation of mites to parasitise flies under dry conditions may serve to replenish mite water stores and facilitate dispersal to more favorable microhabitats.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

In particular, the study of non-coding genomic variation remains a major challenge due to the lack of accurate functional annotation for activity in a given context and across alleles. Experimental evidence is critical for prioritizing and interpreting functional effects of genetic alterations. Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) have emerged as a powerful high-throughput approach, enabling quantification of regulatory element activity and allelic effects, and systematic dissection of gene regulatory logic and variant effects across different contexts. However, the diversity of MPRA designs, lack of standardized formats, and many potential processing parameters hamper data integration, reproducibility, and meta-analyses across studies. To address these challenges, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium established an MPRA focus group to develop community standards, including harmonized file formats, and robust analysis pipelines for a wide range of library types and experimental designs. Here, we present these formats and comprehensive computational tools, MPRAlib and MPRAsnakeflow, for uniform processing from raw sequencing reads to counts, processing and visualization. Using diverse MPRA datasets, we characterize technical variability sources including barcode sequence bias, outlier barcodes, and delivery method (episomal vs. lentiviral).

A.; Nozari, E.", "abstract": "Extensive research over the past two decades has focused on identifying a preictal period in scalp as well as intracranial EEG (iEEG). This has led to a plethora of seizure prediction and forecasting algorithms which have reached only moderate success on curated and pre-segmented EEG datasets (accuracy/AUC [&ge;] 0.8). Furthermore, when tested on their ability to pseudo-prospectively predict seizures from continuous EEG recordings, all existing algorithms suffer from low sensitivity (large false negatives), high time in warning (large false positives), or both. In this study, we provide pilot evidence that predictive modeling of the dynamics of iEEG features (biomarkers), seizure risk, or both at the scale of tens of minutes can significantly improve the pseudo-prospective accuracy of almost any state-of-the-art seizure forecasting model. In contrast to the bulk of prior research that has focused on designing better features and classifiers, we start from off-the-shelf features and classifiers and shift the focus to learning how iEEG features (classifier input) and seizure risk (classifier output) evolve over time. Using iEEG from n = 5 patients undergoing presurgical evaluation at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and six state-of-the-art baseline models, we first demonstrate that a wide array of iEEG features are highly predictable over time, with over 99% and 35% of studied features, respectively, having R2 > 0 for 10-second- and 10-minute-ahead prediction (mean R2 of 0.85 and 0.2). Furthermore, in almost all patients and baseline models, we observe a strong correlation between feature predictability (with some features remaining predictable up to 30 minutes) and classification-based feature importance. As a result, we subsequently demonstrate that adding an autoregressive model that predicts iEEG features on 12{+/-}4 minutes into the future is almost universally beneficial, with a mean improvement of 28% in terms of area under pseudo-prospective sensitivity-time in warning curve (PP-AUC). The addition of the second autoregressive predictive model at the level of seizure risk further improved accuracy, with a total mean improvement of 51% in PP-AUC.

These variations are likely driven by changes in photoperiod length. Anecdotally, a relevant number of people report experiencing fatigue and low energy levels particularly during spring. However, scientific evidence for seasonal variations in fatigue and daytime sleepiness is largely missing. We thus investigated temporal variations in fatigue, daytime sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, and sleep quality through an online survey including repeated (i.e., every six weeks) assessments of the same individuals over the course of one year. We hypothesised that fatigue and daytime sleepiness would be higher during shorter photoperiods. We further expected lower sleep quality and more severe insomnia symptoms under shorter photoperiods. Additionally, we explored variations with photoperiod change, across months, and seasons. Hypotheses were tested using Bayesian linear mixed-effects models. The study and analyses were pre-registered. Between April 2024 and September 2025, 418 adults (80% women) completed at least two assessments. Nearly half of participants (47%) reported experiencing spring fatigue. However, repeated assessments across one year showed no evidence for seasonal or monthly variations in fatigue, sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, or sleep quality. Fatigue during day-to-day activities decreased with longer photoperiods but was independent of photoperiod change. Overall, the results provide evidence against spring fatigue as a genuine seasonal phenomenon. The discrepancy between high self-reports of the phenomenon and stable longitudinal patterns suggests that spring fatigue may reflect cultural labelling and result from cognitive-perceptual biases rather than reflecting a genuine seasonal syndrome.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a vertically integrated platform for simultaneously tracking single-cell migration and assessing CC under confinement. Our system integrates cell engineering via multiplexed sensors for cell-cycle, actin, and tubulin, as well as photopatterned engineered extracellular matrix (ECM) islands of defined sizes. It also features an automated, high-throughput pattern-aware imaging pipeline (Fab2Mic) that enables on-pattern, joint migration-CC assessment in the same live cells. Since the local microenvironment plays a critical role in metastasis by constraining cell behaviors within spatial boundaries, we used an HT1080 fibrosarcoma model as an illustrative case. Where static phenotyping yielded 40% G1 and 60% S/G2/M, with larger cell areas and tubulin spread in the S/G2/M phase, dynamic phenotyping via live-cell imaging confirmed CC-linked motility, with faster instantaneous velocities in G1, exemplifying the CC-migration correlations. These phenotypes were modulated by the spatial confinement imposed by the engineered ECM islands. Stronger confinement reduced cell area and tubulin spread and increased the frequency of abnormal CC events, particularly Long G1 states on smaller engineered ECM islands. It also induced a confinement-specific S/G2/M-G1 mitotic slippage, observed only under our confined conditions. Together, this vertically integrated system suggests that confinement may continuously tune migration-CC coupling and provides a deployable pipeline for CC-aware mechanobiology and screening. Moreover, we stress how dynamic imaging provides access to variables that are difficult or impossible to infer from static snapshots, including velocity and CC timing.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

However, the accuracy of these methods remains unsatisfactory, leaving much room for improvement. Recent advancements in genomic language models have shown remarkable performance in various sequence analysis applications. We investigate if improved embeddings can be achieved using DNA language models. We introduce LLMED, a model designed to produce sequence embeddings approximating the edit distance.

Transcriptome profiling of CD47 wildtype and knockout NSCLC models implicated its regulation of genes enriched for signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and MAPK signaling. Functional studies indicated that CD47 does not regulate cell proliferation in NSCLC cells as it does in other cancer types. Instead, we found that CD47 regulates cell adhesion and migration through an ERK-dependent mechanism, validating our transcriptomic findings. Our discoveries reveal a novel role for CD47 in relaying signals through ERK to promote EMT expression programs and pro-metastatic phenotypes in NSCLC.

B.; Lester, M.; Gissendanner, D.; Vasiliou, V.; Yang, X.", "abstract": "Alcohol consumption has been linked to breast cancer, partly due to the accumulation of toxic aldehydes like acetaldehyde, a carcinogenic byproduct of ethanol metabolism. ALDH2, a key mitochondrial enzyme, detoxifies acetaldehyde and other harmful aldehydes that drive oxidative stress, DNA damage, and hormonal dysregulation, key factors in carcinogenesis. Despite the possible link between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk, little is known about how ALDH2 deficiency itself, independent of alcohol exposure, affects mammary gland biology and cancer susceptibility. Genetic variants leading to ALDH2 deficiency are highly prevalent in East Asian populations, where individuals carrying inactive ALDH2 alleles experience impaired aldehyde detoxification. While these individuals are at increased risk for alcohol-related cancers, the impact of ALDH2 deficiency on mammary gland development and homeostasis in the absence of alcohol exposure remains unexplored. To address this, we utilized a C57BL/6-based ALDH2 knockout (Aldh2-/-) mouse model to investigate its effects on mammary proliferation and development. Our findings revealed that Aldh2-/- mice exhibited hyperproliferative mammary glands, characterized by increased epithelial cell density, ductal expansion, and elevated Ki67+ cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a rise in luminal and basal epithelial subpopulations, alongside enhanced mammary epithelial stemness, as evidenced by increased mammosphere formation and colony-forming efficiency. At the molecular level, ALDH2 deficiency activated oxidative stress pathways, marked by elevated 8-OHdG, p38 MAPK, NF-{kappa}B, and Nrf2 signaling, alongside DNA damage responses involving p53 and H2A.X. Importantly, we also identified a previously unrecognized upregulation of RANKL in Aldh2-/- mammary glands, implicating the RANK/RANKL axis as a critical mediator linking aldehyde stress to NF-{kappa}B/p38 MAPK activation and enhanced mammary stemness. Furthermore, hormonal dysregulation was observed, with a significant increase in ER and PR expression and phosphorylation. Dysregulated ER signaling was further linked to enhanced erbB3 activation and downstream signaling, including the cyclin D1-pRb-E2F1 axis. Our results suggest that the accumulation of endogenous aldehydes, independent of alcohol exposure, profoundly alters mammary morphogenesis, epithelial repopulation, and stemness. Mechanistically, this occurs through oxidative stress activation and DNA damage pathways, leading to metabolic changes and upregulation of estrogen receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.

While the effects of cycle frequency and muscle length excursion on AMPO are well-known, several questions remain about the effects of muscle length and stimulation over time on the maximal attainable AMPO. For example, which precise muscle length and stimulation over time yield maximal AMPO? In situ experiments are inherently limited to a finite set of muscle length and stimulation over time. To overcome this limitation, we combined in situ experiments on rat m. gastrocnemius medialis with Hill-type muscle modelling. We first performed dedicated trials to estimate the muscle-tendon-complex (MTC) properties of each rat. Subsequently, we performed various stretch-shortening cycles with substantial differences in cycle frequency, shortening-to-lengthening time ratio and MTC length excursion. Model-predicted AMPO correlated nearly perfect with experimentally measured AMPO (r2 > 0.98). This justified further exploration using the Hill-type MTC model. Using the Hill-type MTC model, we predicted that AMPO peaks at a cycle frequency of 3.5 Hz, with a shortening-to-lengthening time ratio of 6:1 and an MTC length excursion of 8 mm. Notably, cycle frequency and MTC length excursion showed a strong interaction: increasing one necessitated a decrease in the other to maximise AMPO. By contrast, the optimal shortening-to-lengthening time ratio remained remarkably constant across all tested combinations of cycle frequency and MTC length excursion. This shows that muscles should spend substantially more time shortening than lengthening to maximise AMPO.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Pyramiding resistance loci in the same variety enhances plant resistance, but interactions involving stacked and defeated Rpv and different P. viticola strains are poorly documented. Investigation of these interactions may uncover new information for the development of efficient breeding strategies, the optimal exploitation of Rpv, and the building of durable resistance. In the present study, a grapevine offspring carrying single and pyramided Rpv1, Rpv3.1 and Rpv10 was phenotyped in laboratory conditions for the resistance to P. viticola using a naive strain and a strain virulent towards Rpv10. By using a high-resolution phenotyping strategy based on P. viticola metabolic biomarkers, we demonstrated that the efficacy of Rpv combinations and aggressiveness of P. viticola strains can be quantified in the early phase of infection and were often related to sporulation outcome. Furthermore, we described how a limited residual effect of a defeated Rpv may become significant in pyramiding.

Here, we investigated the transcriptome of rice roots upon exposure to the complete cocktail of fungal exudates from either beneficial Rhizophagus irregularis or pathogenic Magnaporthe oryzae. We report that regardless of the exudate donor species, the transcriptional response lacked diagnostic differences. Instead, the profiles were marked by the common suppression of symbiosis signalling components, accompanied by the induction of a generic stress response (GSR) and defense-related signature, which was retained in a suite of symbiosis signalling mutants impaired at different stages of symbiosis development. However, upon permitting physical engagement with AM fungi, a striking reversion in the transcriptional responses occurred marked by the simultaneous relaxation of symbiosis signalling suppression and down-regulation of defense-related and GSR markers, overall comparable between wild-type and mutants.

Objectives: To examine temporal shifts in the maternal gut metabolome and associations between pregnancy-specific shifts and postpartum depression (PPD). Methods: We applied untargeted metabolomics (UPLC-MS/MS) to fecal samples collected from participants (N= 25) enrolled in the Maternal and Infant NutriTion (MINT) study. Random forest analysis was used to identify key pathways and metabolites contributing to temporal shifts. Fold change analysis and paired t-tests were used to quantify the magnitude and significance of metabolite changes. Associations between pregnancy-specific changes and PPD (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at 6 weeks) were identified using Pearsons correlation. Results: Lipid, amino acid, and xenobiotic metabolism emerged as core pathways driving temporal changes in the maternal gut metabolome. The most pronounced shifts occurred from 35 weeks gestation to postpartum, with 55 metabolites significantly altered compared to 24 from 24- to 35 weeks gestation and 26 from 24 weeks gestation to postpartum.

A.", "abstract": "Many N-terminally endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored cytochrome P450 proteins (P450s) turn over proteolytically via ER-associated degradation (ERAD), others via ER-to-lysosomal-associated degradation (ERLAD), and yet others via both pathways. What precisely dictates their differential proteolytic turnover is unknown. Herein, we employed rabbit liver CYPs 1A1 and 1A2, which reportedly reside in liquid-disorded (ld)- and detergent-resistant, liquid-ordered (lo)-ER-microdomains, respectively, governed by their specific N-terminal (NT) signal-anchor (SA) subdomains. We now report that this precise SA-dependent ER-topology not only determines the proclivity of CYP1A1 towards ERAD and CYP1A2 towards ERLAD, but also their differential lifespans. We further document that the detergent-resistant lo-ER-membranes (DRMs) are morphologically quite similar to mitochondria-associated ER-membranes (MAMs), documented cellular platforms for autophagic-initiation complexes. DRMs and MAMs, composed of saturated fatty-acids, glycosphingolipids and cholesterol, harbor many common morphological markers including the ER-specific prohibitin, erlin-1. Herein employing SURF, a split fluorogenic bifunctional complementation assay, we show that intracellularly, erlin-1 and CYP1A2 interact closely via their ER NT-SAs. siRNA-knockdown (KD) of erlin-1 in HepG2-cells, not only relocated CYP1A2 from DRMs to non-DRMs, but also impaired its ERLAD, resulting in insoluble cellular CYP1A2 aggregates. Upon erlin-1 KD, CYP1A2 ERLAD could be rescued by co-expression of a siRNA-resistant intact erlin-1 or just its NT-1-30 residue SA-domain. Our findings are the first to reveal that the CYP1A2 lifespan and preferential proclivity towards ERLAD is determined by its close association with erlin-1 within DRMs/MAMs. As proof of concept, we document that the ERLAD-proclivity of CYP2B1 is also similarly dependent upon erlin-1-DRM-association.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

We quantified nutrient inventories, primary productivity and N2 fixation during the BLOOFINZ-IO expedition (February 2022) in the Argo Basin located in the eastern Indian Ocean, the sole known spawning ground for Southern Bluefin Tuna. Surface nitrate concentrations were near depletion (<0.02 umol L-1), with low but persistent residual phosphate (P) concentrations suggesting nitrogen as the major limiting nutrient. Depth-integrated net primary production (NPP), from 14C-based in-situ incubations during 4 Lagrangian cycles, averaged ~460 mg C m-2d-1, in good agreement with satellite-based NPP estimates. Nitrogen fixation provided a consistent new nitrogen source, contributing ~16% to local NPP in the upper euphotic zone. Gross primary production (GPP), derived from fast-repetition-rate-fluorometry-based electron transport estimates, revealed significant autotrophic respiration losses, with GPP:NPP ratios averaging ~1.8, consistent with metabolic costs under nutrient limitation. Net community production (NCP), estimated from O2/Ar ratios, remained positive across all cycles, averaging ~20% of NPP in the upper 30 m. This result, in combination with N2 fixation measurement indicates that N2 fixation supports most of the export production in this region. Together, the multi-method approach revealed a recycling-dominated ecosystem affected by episodic mixing events, where primary productivity is maintained primarily through efficient nitrogen recycling and physiological photoacclimation. These results provide a comprehensive baseline of bottom-up support on ecosystem productivity for the Argo Basin for assessing future climate-driven changes in stratification, nutrient cycling, and food-web dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Under the conditions of metabolic steady (or metabolic conservation), resource diffusion dimension (D) and metabolic network dimension (D+1), which together define the biological space by at most three space parameters (x, y, z) and one direct parameter (d), unified the topological geometry principle and metabolic scaling function of the four rules, B{propto}MD/D+1. The results indicated that EMS follows a Fibonacci sequence (f(n), n) evolution law at kingdom level, from neutral system (prokaryote 1, 1), niche system (unicellular eukaryote 1, 2), modular similarity system (plant 2, 3), to internal metabolic system (animal 3, 4), as indicated by (D, D+1). Further derivation revealed the positions of superbody system (fungi 5, 5) and primitive soup system (0, 0) in this evolutionary sequence. Thus, a conceptual model of macroevolution with the connotation of metabolism co-evolution between life and ecosystem was proposed. This article took the four principles of ecosystem organization as theory prototypes and the analysis paradigm of biological space developed by metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) as referential methodology. It preliminarily constructed the logical, conceptual, and methodological system of EMS hypothesis, and provided a deducible Fibonacci roadmap for macroevolution.

Epigenetic clocks are associated with early-life famine exposure. We investigated the impact of a cluster-randomized early-life nutrition intervention on epigenetic age. Methods: We analyzed follow-up data from participants in the INCAP Nutrition Supplementation Trial, conducted in 4 villages in eastern Guatemala. DNA methylation was measured in buffy coat samples using the Illumina InfiniumTM MethylationEPICv2.0 array and standard quality control procedures. Epigenetic age was quantified using DunedinPACE, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. PhenoAge and GrimAge acceleration were calculated as residuals by regressing epigenetic age on chronological age. We used intent-to-treat difference-in-difference modeling to assess the impact of a protein-energy supplement provided during the first 1,000 days of life (conception to age 2y) on epigenetic age in middle adulthood. Covariates included sex, birth year, the trial supplement type (atole [intervention] vs. fresco [control]), exposure period of supplement (any of the first 1,000 days, other), and a random effect to account for sibships. The primary coefficient of interest was represented by the interaction between supplement type and exposure period. Results: The analysis included 1095 participants (mean age 45.0 y (SD 4.3); 60.3 % female, 40.3 % exposed to any atole during the first 1,000 days, mean DunedinPACE 1.2 (SD 0.1), Phenoage 46.7 y (SD 6.7), and GrimAge 56.3 y (SD 4.1). In difference-in-difference analyses, exposure to atole during any of the first 1,000-day period was associated with lower DunedinPACE (- 0.03, 95% CI -0.06, -0.004), PhenoAge acceleration (-1.91 y, 95% CI -3.43, -0.39), and GrimAge acceleration (-0.85 y, 95% CI -1.53, -0.11) compared to other exposures. Following additional adjustment for cell type proportions, the direction of the coefficients remained the same but were no longer statistically significant. Conclusions: Exposure to atole during the first 1,000 days was associated with modest reductions in epigenetic age as measured by DunedinPACE, PhenoAge, and GrimAge.

A total of 348 cattle from eight indigenous breeds of Benin, including taurine (Lagune, Borgou, Pabli, and Somba), zebu (Gudali, Zebu Peuhl, and Yakana) and one crossbred (Bourgou X Zebu) cattle were genotyped along with a reference dataset of cattle from Europe, Asia, and West Africa. After quality control, 28.591 SNPs from 838 cattle were analyzed for genetic diversity, differentiation, and admixture. Pairwise FST values revealed significant genetic differentiation between local taurine and zebu breeds (FST = 0.05 - 0.15), with some populations showing close genetic relationships, while others, such as the Borgou and N'Dama breeds, exhibiting relatively more divergence. The admixture analysis indicated significant gene flow from zebu cattle into local taurine breeds, suggesting adaptive introgression driven by factors such as heat tolerance and disease resistance. Additionally, the effective population size (Ne) was relatively higher in Benins taurine breeds as compared to zebu, likely attributable to traditional open communal mating practices. The genetic structure also reflected the influence of both historical and ongoing introgression from Asian zebu cattle. The results highlight the importance of maintaining genetic diversity through regional breeding strategies that consider environmental and adaptive pressures. The results of the present study will serve as a basis for the development of Community Based Breeding Programs (CBBPs) for Beninese cattle adapted to local contexts, integrating information on admixture levels, breeders' preferences, production performance, and the conservation of local genetic diversity.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying synovial tissue impairment in OA is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic interventions. Huoxuezhitongsan (HXZTS), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has shown promising therapeutic effects in treating OA, but its mechanisms of action on synovial tissue remain unclear. Method This study integrated network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis, molecular docking, and experimental validation to elucidate the potential targets, pathways, and mechanisms by which HXZTS exert therapeutic effects on osteoarthritic synovial tissue. Results Network analysis identified 21 active ingredients and 111 common targets of HXZTS for OA, with key compounds like quercetin, {beta}-sitosterol, and stigmasterol. Enrichment analysis revealed HXZTS modulates inflammation through TNF, IL-17, and MAPK signaling pathways, oxidative stress, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metabolic regulation. Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinities of HXZTS compounds with targets like AKT1, TNF, TP53, IL6, and VEGFA. RT-qPCR validation confirmed the downregulation of inflammatory mediators like IL6 and PTGS2, alongside the upregulation of genes associated with potential cartilage repair effects, such as MMP1 and MMP3, upon HXZTS treatment. Conclusions HXZTS exerts therapeutic effects on osteoarthritic synovial tissue through a multifaceted mechanism involving modulation of inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metabolic regulation.

We show that cytoskeletal elements such as actin localized along lateral cell edges undergo tilt and bend instabilities that buffer mechanical load by decoupling apicobasal stretching from lateral extension. These reversible instabilities act as elastic safety valves, permitting large shape changes without loss of epithelial hydraulic and topological integrity. A minimal theoretical and computational model demonstrates how tilt and bend reduce effective resistance to radial thinning and explains the observed strain softening. Thus, iPSC shells exploit reversible cytoskeletal instabilities as mechanical buffers, enabling robust tolerance of large deformations in developing epithelia.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Dordaviprone (ONC201) and its chemical derivative with nanomolar potency, ONC206, induce apoptosis of cancer cells by activation of the mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P (ClpP). ONC206 is currently in Phase I clinical trials for pediatric patients with primary brain tumors. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the preclinical therapeutic effects of ONC206 in medulloblastoma and investigated its mechanism of action. Results: We found evidence for high expression of ClpP at both the RNA and protein level in medulloblastoma tumors, compared to very low expression in normal brain tissue. In addition, we saw a pronounced reduction in cell viability of human Group 3 and Group 4 and murine SHH-driven and Group 3 medulloblastoma cells treated with ONC206 with low IC-50s. After treatment with ONC206, we observed an induction of integrated stress response and mitochondrial damage. To test the efficacy of ONC206 in vivo, we used murine models of SHH-driven and Group 3 medulloblastoma as well as Group 3 and Group 4 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). ONC206 led to a significant prolongation of survival in both murine models, with the SHH mice demonstrating survival extension from 70 to 140 days. PDX-bearing mice also responded to ONC206, which led to a significant survival benefit.

However, the regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. We identify the antioxidant enzyme NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) as a novel SG regulator that enhances SG assembly in pancreatic cancer cells independently of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistic studies reveal that NQO1 does not regulate the expression of G3BP1 or other SG associated genes. Instead, NQO1 undergoes LLPS dependent on its RNA-binding K homology (KH) like domain. Further analysis demonstrates that residues 121~131 of NQO1 directly interact with G3BP1's RNA binding domain (RBD), enhancing the multivalency of G3BP1 complexes to potentiate LLPS-driven SG assembly. This interaction accelerates cell proliferation, KRAS mutation-induced acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM), and pancreatic carcinogenesis.

Here, we report that 5xFAD transgenic mice exhibit hyperarousal and reduced brain-state transitions, particularly during the dark phase, as early as two months of age. The Locus Coeruleus (LC), a key regulator of arousal and brain-state transitions and a region highly vulnerable in AD, shows time-specific hyperactivity during this phase. This increased tonic LC activity is mediated by heightened neuronal excitability due to impaired Kv4 and Kv7 potassium channel conductance. Pharmacological activation of 2A adrenergic receptors restored Kv4 and Kv7 function and normalized LC activity. Furthermore, local administration of the 2A agonist guanfacine or the Kv7 positive allosteric modulator retigabine substantially rescued the sleep-wake disturbances in young 5xFAD mice.

Acute A{beta} application caused marked neuronal hyperexcitability, with increased spike frequencies and calcium influx, and led to enhanced intestinal contractility without altering frequency or timing. Prolonged 72-hour exposure did not induce cell death or apoptosis but significantly reduced neurite outgrowth and decreased synaptic markers and beta II tubulin. These findings suggest that acute A{beta} primarily drives the excitability of enteric neurons and intestinal motility, while prolonged exposure subsequently leads to structural and synaptic changes.

We investigate the regulation of ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 expression using in vitro differentiated OT1 TCR transgenic memory-like T cells. We characterise the differential kinetics and sensitivity of ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 to antigen affinity and PMA versus ionomycin stimulation. By selectively inhibiting TCR-induced signalling pathways, we find that p38 MAPK, MEK1/2 and PKC contribute to inducing both ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 expression. By contrast, inhibition of calcineurin using cyclosporin A potently inhibits ZFP36L1 expression while increasing and prolonging ZFP36 expression. The Zfp36 promoter contains many binding sites for the transcription factors ELK-1/4 and few binding sites for NFAT, while the Zfp36l1 promoter contains many NFAT binding sites and few ELK1/4 binding sites.

Bacteriocins are key mediators of intra-species competition, yet many of their functions and regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify and characterize streptolancidin D, a previously uncharacterized bacteriocin encoded by the sldA-T locus and demonstrate its contribution to pneumococcal competition. Using a naturally colonizing strain, we show that deletion of sldA-T impairs inhibition of competitor strains in in vitro biofilms and during murine co-colonization. We further show that sldA-T is regulated by the Rgg144/SHP144 quorum sensing system, with promoter activity abolished in a SHP-deficient background and partially restored by exogenous peptide stimulation. Genomic analyses revealed that sldA-T is consistently encoded downstream of the Rgg144/SHP144 system and is present in ~12% of over 7,500 pneumococcal genomes, with lineage-specific patterns of distribution. This observation suggests a regulated mechanism that provides competitive advantages in strain-strain interactions, which might help explaining the long-term persistence of certain clones even under PCV13 pressure.

This dependency renders them key sensors of the cell's metabolic state, driving crucial functions when oxygen or metabolic homeostasis is perturbed, including adaptation to low oxygen, epigenetic control of gene transcription, and the reshaping of metabolic pathways. Jumonji-C (JmjC) domain-containing protein 5 (JMJD5), a 2OGDD that alters epigenetic marks, is essential for DNA damage repair and is a key regulator of cell metabolism. Notably, JMJD5 is often lost in hepatocellular carcinoma, which correlates with poor overall survival. Despite its biological significance, the molecular functions of JMJD5 remain unresolved, and its physiological targets are elusive. Here, we identify and characterise a novel signalling pathway where JMJD5 hydroxylates an arginine residue on the protein ISY1. This modification enables ISY1 to bind to and reduce the activity of Protein Arginine N-methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6). Significantly, the inactivation of PRMT6 rescues the majority of the molecular phenotype driven by JMJD5 loss, establishing the JMJD5-ISY1-PRMT6 pathway as the principal executor of JMJD5's enzymatic function. This signalling pathway clarifies existing controversies regarding JMJD5's function and identifies PRMT6 as a potential therapeutic target for treating cancers that lack JMJD5.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

K.; Srivastava, R. K.", "abstract": "Osteoporosis and other forms of inflammatory bone loss are marked by disrupted bone remodelling resulting from an imbalance between osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-driven bone formation. This imbalance is often exacerbated by chronic inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Recently, attention has turned to gut-associated metabolites (GAMs) such as secondary bile acids, particularly deoxycholic acid (DCA), which act as immunomodulators influencing both systemic inflammation and bone metabolism. In this study, we investigated the role of DCA in inflammatory bone loss using an in vivo model, with a focus on osteoblast and osteoclast function, gut barrier integrity, and gut-microbiota diversity. DCA administration significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis along with enhancing osteoblastogenesis, indicating its dual regulatory role in bone remodelling. Furthermore, DCA treatment enhanced gut integrity, reversed dysbiosis and reduced systemic inflammation by downregulating osteoclastogenic cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-17, RANKL, etc.). These findings suggest that DCA mitigates LPS-induced inflammatory bone loss through a multifaceted mechanism involving direct effects on bone cells and restoration of gut integrity and homeostasis. Our results highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the gut microbiota-derived bile acid pathway, particularly DCA, as a novel strategy for managing osteoporosis and other inflammatory bone disorders.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

We quantified species richness, functional redundancy, phylogenetic diversity, and genetic sequence diversity, and related them to drainage characteristics. Our results showed that eDNA effectively captured global patterns of multi-faceted riverine fish biodiversity and disentangled the roles of climate and human activities in shaping biodiversity-area relationships. Catchments in warmer climates consistently enhanced biodiversity accumulation with area, while higher human activity intensity weakened this scaling. Species richness, functional, and genetic sequence diversity exhibited stronger negative responses to human activities in larger catchments. In contrast, phylogenetic diversity showed the strongest negative effects in smaller catchments with these impacts diminishing as catchment area increased, highlighting the facet-dependent nature of biodiversity responses to environmental gradients.

During budding, their nucleocapsid core forms in the cytoplasm and adopts a T=4 icosahedral symmetry, a hallmark of Alphaviruses. Here, we combine structural and phylogenetic analyses to identify the amino acids most likely to govern capsomer formation (pentamers and hexamers) and core organization. We find that these residues are highly conserved in present-day Old-World alphaviruses but are divergent in New-World lineages. This suggests that the common ancestor of both groups likely assembled cores using the same molecular interactions seen in present-day Old-World viruses. We propose that early divergence in these interactions weakened core assembly efficiency, potentially contributing to the attenuation observed in encephalitic New-World alphaviruses. This attenuation may reflect an adaptive trade-off, in which reduced assembly efficiency lowers viral replication and virulence, supporting long-term persistence in enzootic cycles. By revealing how specific residues control capsid symmetry and tracing their evolutionary history, this study provides key insights into alphavirus assembly mechanisms, opening new avenues for antiviral strategies and rational vaccine design.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Accurate species and strain-level identification is essential for understanding its epidemiology, pathogenic potential, and response to treatment. In this study, we established Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as a rapid, cost-effective method for distinguishing M. pachydermatis from other Malassezia species, including M. globosa, M. furfur, M. restricta, and M. sympodialis. Within M. pachydermatis, FTIR spectroscopy resolved even closely related strains with high accuracy producing clusters congruent with WGS-based phylogeny.

M.; Courtalon, J.; Asselin, K.; Thomas, F.", "abstract": "Comparative oncology is a rapidly expanding field that seeks to explain variation in cancer risk across species by examining trends between tumour prevalence and key risk factors such as body mass, longevity, life history traits, and mutation rates. These trends are then used to address fundamental questions in the field, including the discovery of potential novel anti-cancer therapies, improvements to species conservation efforts, and understanding how cancer has influenced the evolution of multicellularity. They thus must be robust. This study demonstrates that when estimated on captive species those trends are heavily influenced by their scientific and public popularity, and that accounting for this bias can substantially alter their direction and magnitude. Hence, we reanalysed published captive vertebrate datasets examining the associations between neoplasia, malignancy, and lethal tumour prevalences with body mass, longevity, life history traits, and germinal cells mutation rates. When we included proxies of species popularity in our analyses, the previously reported weak effect of body mass on tumour and malignancy prevalences disappeared entirely. Similarly, the previously reported positive relationship between germline mutation rate and cancer mortality was eliminated after controlling for popularity bias. For life history traits, the effect of clutch size on cancer neoplasia and malignancy prevalences in birds doubled in magnitude, and while the negative trend between gestation length and tumour prevalence in mammals was not greatly affected, our analyses revealed that baseline tumour prevalences were underestimated for popular animals. Finally, the previously observed association between hemochorial placentation and cancer mortality in mammals was eliminated when confounding variables were included. Collectively, these results demonstrate that current comparative analyses based on tumour prevalence in captive animals are heavily influenced by species' scientific and public popularities. Future studies utilising such datasets should incorporate measures of species popularity as confounding variables to ensure more robust conclusions and misleading research directions.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

D.; Estarellas, M.; Dauphin, M.; Pascovich, C.; Canales-Johnson, A.", "abstract": "Pure awareness (PA) is described in contemplative traditions as a wakeful state largely devoid of cognitive content, often considered a case of minimal phenomenal experience (MPE). Transcendental Meditation (TM) provides an excellent empirical model for PA because it is standardized, effortless, and reliably induces reports of awareness with minimal content. We combined phenomenological and electrophysiological approaches to study PA in 33 experienced TM practitioners and matched controls (performing mental counting). Using Temporal Experience Tracing, TM practitioners reported greater intensity and variability of PA than controls, regardless of years of meditation practice, consistent with the notion of 'automatic self-transcendence'. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and multivariate classification analyses, our large-scale screening of theoretically motivated EEG markers revealed a double dissociation in neural signatures. When contrasting TM with controls, temporal entropy and aperiodic dynamics were the strongest discriminators, while functional connectivity based on phase coherence contributed the least. In contrast, when TM was compared with its own baseline, low-frequency functional connectivity dominated, while temporal entropy contributed minimally to classification. This dissociation suggests that PA is characterized by enhanced EEG signals' diversity and aperiodic neural dynamics compared to ordinary cognition but stabilized by slow-frequency oscillatory synchronization relative to rest. Finally, TM showed little evidence of carry-over effects from meditation into subsequent rest, in contrast to controls, where counting induced residual changes. Together, these results provide the most systematic electrophysiological characterization of PA to date and establish neurophenomenology as a robust framework for advancing the neuroscience of minimal phenomenal experience.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Camera trapping has become an indispensable tool in wildlife ecology, generating vast datasets that require efficient and robust analytical workflows. The R package camtrapR was originally developed for preparing and managing camera trap data for subsequent analysis in external modeling packages like unmarked. It has since become a standard tool in the field for this purpose. 2. Here, we introduce a major update that transforms camtrapR from a data preparation tool into a comprehensive, end-to-end analytical platform. The centerpiece of this evolution is the surveyDashboard(), a novel code-free graphical user interface that guides users through the entire analysis pipeline, from data import to final predictions. This update also incorporates enhanced data import functionalities for major standards like Wildlife Insights and Camtrap DP, a complete workflow for fitting community occupancy models, and streamlined tools for environmental covariate extraction. 3. The interactive dashboard provides an integrated environment for the entire analytical process. Users can perform essential exploratory analyses, such as generating species accumulation curves and mapping species detections, before proceeding to model fitting. The interface supports the interactive construction of both single-species and multi-species (community) occupancy models. The dashboard's covariate preparation tools generate inputs for both model fitting and for creating spatial predictions of species occupancy. 4. Furthermore, the update introduces a comprehensive workflow for fitting Bayesian community occupancy models using JAGS or NIMBLE. This allows for hierarchical modeling of species- and community-level responses to environmental drivers, providing deeper insights into wildlife communities. The workflow includes tools for model assessment, such as convergence diagnostics and posterior predictive checks for goodness-of-fit. 5. By integrating a powerful, code-free interface with advanced backend modeling functions, this major update to camtrapR aims to make robust and reproducible camera trap data analysis accessible to a wider audience, including ecologists, wildlife managers, and students.

Objective: To deeply characterize FF-fibroblasts and identify programs governing their differentiation and activation. Methods: GeoMx spatial transcriptomics was applied to IPF lung regions, comparing carefully delineated FF (excluding overlying epithelium) with areas of established fibrosis, to derive an FF-specific signature. This signature was projected onto a large single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset to identify an FF-specific fibroblast cluster, facilitating its deep characterization. Measurements and Main Results: GeoMx revealed 272 increased genes in FF; this FF-signature was validated against several independent spatial transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. FF-signature genes were highly enriched in a specific cluster of fibroblasts in the IPF scRNA-seq dataset. MMP11 was the most specific gene of the FF-fibroblast cluster, and was validated using in situ RNA hybridization. Furthermore, higher MMP11 bronchoalveolar lavage protein levels were found in progressive pulmonary fibrosis and were associated with worse outcome in Cox regression (HR 4.54, 95% CI 1.24-15.8). Cell-cell interaction analysis with fibroblasts and adjacent aberrant basaloid cells, detected signals that may induce the FF-fibroblast signature, including from TGF-{beta} superfamily ligands. Using trajectory and transcription factor (TF) analysis we show that the trajectory from non-FF to FF-specific fibroblasts is correlated with activation of EMT-associated TFs and deactivation of AP-1 family TFs. Conclusions: We identified transcriptional programs governing FF-fibroblasts, for which MMP11 serves as a novel highly-specific biomarker with prognostic significance.

The rapid growth and treatment-resistant nature of these tumors are primarily influenced by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which is led by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). However, factors influencing or regulating the immunosuppressive nature of TAMs have not been sufficiently studied. In this manuscript, we use a mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) to demonstrate that WNT expression in TAMs regulates their immunosuppressive function by inhibiting Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3{beta}) within the macrophages, possibly through an autofeedback loop. GSK3{beta} is a positive regulator of PD-1 and PDL1 expression in macrophages and promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, GSK-3{beta} inhibition alters the immunosuppressive nature of the immune microenvironment and effectively controls tumor growth. In Csf1r-iCre; Porcnfl/fl mice, the absence of macrophage-derived WNT promotes tumor growth in the model of colitis-associated colon cancer. Absence of macrophage-derived WNT stabilizes GSK-3{beta} in macrophages and promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We also show that pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3{beta} in a macrophage-specific manner, achieved by systemic delivery of a lipo-GSK3{beta} inhibitor, effectively inhibits tumor growth. Therefore, this manuscript demonstrates for the first time that the macrophage-specific modulation of GSK3{beta} can be a potential target to treat colitis-associated colon cancer.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

To elucidate these early regulators of inflammation, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in macrophages to identify genes that influence the induction of TNF and iNOS upon infection with Mtb. The resulting dataset is a valuable resource that includes genes representing a wide range of unexpected regulatory mechanisms that control cytokine responses to Mtb and also cell-intrinsic resistance to infection by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.

Prey species use proactive responses, such as site selection and the adjustment of daily activity patterns to anticipate and avoid predation exposure. In contrast, reactive responses, including fleeing, referential signaling and retaliation, occur after encountering a predator to mitigate the immediate predation risk. The presence of a predator in an area can also generate longer-term responses, such as reactive avoidance defined here as the temporary avoidance of the area following the passage of a predator. Such a long-term reactive response remains understudied in primates. To investigate reactive avoidance, we analyzed an extensive camera trap dataset of 3,042 detections (defined here as a motion-triggered event of three pictures per trigger during the day and one picture at night) of both chacma (Papio ursinus) and olive (Papio anubis) baboons, including 6,958 detections of their main predators, lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), in four savanna sites (Madikwe Game Reserve, Tswalu Kalahari Private Wildlife Reserve and the Associated Private Nature Reserves, South Africa; Serengeti National Park, Tanzania). We examined whether baboons display species-specific reactive avoidance towards predators up to 72 hours after the detection of a predator using randomization tests. We found no significant decrease in baboon presence (defined as the number of baboon detections) 0 to 24 hours, 24 to 48 hours and 48 to 72 hours after the detection of any predator species. These results suggest that baboons may not display reactive avoidance and rely on alternative predator-avoidance strategies, such as proactive avoidance or aggressive retaliation, to mitigate predation risk.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

These systems are known to be maintained by cyclic process of grazing and nutrient deposition in the soil by foraging animals. The basic ecological characteristics of these short-grass systems have extensively been studied in the African context with little understanding particularly from the Himalayan foothills in Terai. In this study, we focused on understanding the ecological baselines such as grass species associations and associated nutrient content in these grazing lawns and tall grass formations across two protected areas of the Uttar Pradesh Terai in India. Our results show that, the protected areas had relatively similar grass species composition and associated nutrient content in the short-grass formations. However, when compared with tall grass formations, the grazing lawns differed markedly in both their grass associations and thus forage quality. Therefore, the results from this study indicate the need to maintain such grazing lawn habitats within the characteristic tall-wet grasslands of the Terai. This also indicates the importance of short-grass formations in providing palatable forage to the mammalian herbivores particularly in peak dry seasons of autumn and winters.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

We have established urine-derived stem cells (USCs) as a non-invasive stem cell source capable of osteogenic and robust chondrogenic differentiation in 3D. Single-cell RNA sequencing of USCs revealed a hierarchy originating from parietal epithelial cells of the kidney, with a proliferative TOP2A subpopulation governed by MYC and E2F4 regulatory networks. Integration of chondrogenic USCs with a human cartilage single-cell reference has led to the identification of a TIMP3-expressing chondrocyte-like subpopulation that exhibits cartilage-specific gene ontologies. Pseudotime analysis uncovers an ALDH1A2 intermediate state and alternative chondrogenic differentiation trajectories. In conclusion, a streamlined, xeno-free culture and differentiation protocol has been developed, thereby establishing a foundational framework for clinical-grade expansion and cartilage matrix formation.

There is an urgent need for improved in vitro models, to advance understanding, and to test new therapeutic approaches. This study describes the development and characterization of a human coronary artery organ-chip model of vascular inflammation, with physiological biomechanical stimulation. Human coronary artery endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were cultured on appropriate extracellular matrices in the two adjoining channels of the Chip-S1 from Emulate Inc. Both endothelial and smooth muscle cells demonstrated characteristic phenotypic identity, shown by expression of CD31 and -SMA respectively. Application of physiological pulsatile tensile strain induced alignment of both cell types, perpendicular to strain direction, as seen in vivo. Addition of TNF- to the vascular channel drove an inflammatory response in both cell types, shown by upregulation of ICAM-1 and P65, and attachment and invasion of circulating THP-1 monocytes. Strain field analysis revealed pressure-dependent spatial variation with 12% strain in the center of the chip, and 5% towards the ends. Pulsatile tensile strain reduced the inflammatory response to TNF- with a greater localized inflammatory response in areas of lower strain, further replicating in vivo behavior. In conclusion, we present a fully characterized, tri-culture model of the human coronary artery which recapitulates the physiological effects of pulsatile vessel dilation on morphology and localized inflammatory susceptibility.

Optogenetics offers a low-energy alternative for rhythm control, but its efficacy in human atrial tissue remains under investigation. Here, we developed a two-dimensional computational model of human atrial tissue expressing the light-sensitive protein GtACR1, coupled with fibroblasts, to simulate spiral wave dynamics under varying degrees (0%-100%) and types (focal vs. diffuse) of fibrosis. We examined the effects of subthreshold illumination area (0%-100%) and spatial intensity profiles (uniform, parabolic, linear, exponential) on termination efficiency, and tested low-intensity periodic stimulation for wave drift induction. Results show that the minimum light area required for termination increases with fibrosis degree. At 25%-50% fibrosis, focal substrates require larger illumination areas than diffuse ones, confirming stronger anchoring. Crucially, the relationship between illumination area and termination time is non-monotonic. An \"optimal light range\" exists: smaller areas fail to eliminate the wave, while excessively large areas suppress wavefront collisions, prolonging termination. In diffuse fibrosis, low-intensity periodic illumination successfully induces drift and boundary collision, enabling self-termination. In contrast, in focal fibrosis, the spiral wave core remains anchored, and drift cannot be initiated by modulating stimulation frequency or intensity alone. Our findings demonstrate that fibrosis type and extent critically influence optogenetic control efficacy. The existence of an optimal illumination strategy highlights the need for spatially tailored interventions. These results provide a mechanistic basis for developing individualized, low-energy optogenetic defibrillation protocols.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

D.; Goodfellow, M.", "abstract": "Neural Mass Models (NMMs) are important mathematical tools for inferring hidden neural mechanisms that generate healthy and pathological brain activities. A critical step in the inference process is parameter estimation, which calibrates NMMs based on measured neuroimaging data. While parameter estimation can be conducted via various approaches, one of the most influential methods is Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). DCM adopts a Bayesian inference approach that relies on, and is sensitive to, the specification of prior parameter distributions reflecting a priori hypotheses about the causes of data. However, most parameters of NMMs encode neuronal properties that are not directly measurable. For this reason, in the absence of sufficient empirical data and well-founded prior beliefs, inference becomes increasingly susceptible to bias. Therefore, it was imperative to establish a comprehensive strategy for mapping model parameters to data. This study proposes a computational extension of DCM, named DCM with dynamics-informed priors (DIP-DCM), which adopts a genetic algorithm (GA) to map parameter values to model dynamics. Optimal sub-regions of the parameter space were subsequently selected and translated into groups of parameter priors for DCM. DIP-DCM was compared to the `standard' DCM inference and to the standalone GA, using two independent neuroimaging datasets. Results indicated that DIP-DCM models were the best predictors of data and captured key mechanistic signatures of psychiatric disease and pharmacological interventions. Overall, DIP-DCM addressed degeneracy, handled local minima, and explored diverse parameter regimes following trajectories informed directly by model dynamics and data. This study suggests that DIP-DCM is an advantageous route to parameter estimation when information is limited, enabling a data-driven derivation of parameter priors - or hypotheses - in exploratory studies, across different biological contexts and datasets.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Recent experiments also implicate the mechanotransducers YAP/TAZ in HHT pathology. However, how YAP/TAZ stiffness sensitivity and signaling activity contribute to aberrant HHT angiogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we extended our previous computational framework of stiffness-mediated YAP/TAZ-VEGF-NOTCH crosstalk to account for ALK1 signalling and predict the resulting angiogenic temporal dynamics. Our simulations predicted that ALK1 knockout impairs NOTCH activation, slowing endothelial phenotypic selection and shuffling while enhancing filopodia activity, features corresponding with hypersprouting. These effects were most pronounced in low stiffness environments, consistent with the previously observed prevalence of HHT vascular malformations in low stiffness organs. Importantly, the temporal dynamics of endothelial phenotypic selection and shuffling, as well as key protein activity levels, were partially restored by direct or cytoskeleton-mediated inhibition of YAP/TAZ resulting from increased NOTCH activation. These computational findings offer more mechanistic insight into the signalling pathways and temporal dynamics of endothelial phenotypic selection underlying HHT vascular anomalies, and suggest that targeting YAP/TAZ and endothelial stiffness sensitivity may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to restore physiological angiogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

This balance is especially critical in the epididymis, where sperm mature and ascending infections frequently disrupt homeostasis, resulting in regionally different immune responses and potential long-term fertility impairments. We previously demonstrated that the epididymis harbors a region-specific immunological scaffold, with CX3CR1+ macrophages as the most prominent epithelium-associated immune cell population. Here, we established a transgenic mouse model to selectively deplete these intraepithelial CX3CR1+ macrophages within the epididymis, resulting in focal epithelial damage and impaired sperm maturation processes essential for proper sperm functionality. Additionally, a mild reduction of the testicular macrophage pool resulted in transient disruptions in spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis. Although the macrophage niche was repopulated after depletion, the newly recruited cells displayed altered phenotypes consistent with persistent sperm alterations. Following infection with uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), macrophage-depleted mice exhibited exacerbated immune responses - particularly in normally protected proximal epididymal regions - with earlier onset and more severe tissue damage. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a failure to restrain inflammatory responses, especially in genes involved in immune regulation and antibacterial defense, accompanied by elevated immune cell infiltration in infected macrophage-depleted mice.

We simulated eight port-to-port voyages for two vessel classes - a crude oil tanker and a container ship - under three routing scenarios: baseline optimisation, speed reduction to 10 kts within core habitats, and complete avoidance of these areas. Across routes, fuel-use changes ranged from -0.13% to 9.65%, with minimal impacts (<1%) for most long-distance voyages. Results indicate that speed reduction is the more efficient mitigation for short voyages, while area avoidance is preferable for longer voyages, with impacts varying by vessel type and operational constraints. Incorporating dynamic, species-specific habitat layers into voyage planning could enable targeted ship-strike mitigation with negligible disruption to global trade.

Our study investigates how selective logging influences genetic diversity, gene dispersal, and seedling establishment in Dicorynia guianensis by comparing a logged and an unlogged forest plot in French Guiana. We genotyped 703 individuals using 66 nuclear SSR markers and applied parentage analyses to infer dispersal patterns and reproductive success. We analyzed genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure across life stages, and tested whether seedling recruitment was associated with logging-related canopy openings. Genetic diversity indices were broadly similar between logged and unlogged plots, with no evidence of genetic erosion in adults or seedlings. Seedling establishment was associated with logging-induced canopy openings. Parentage analyses revealed shorter mean dispersal distances in the logged plot but substantial long-distance pollen flow, ensuring admixture and inter-plot connectivity. Reproductive success was more evenly distributed among mothers, whereas male contributions were skewed in the logged plot. Selective logging did not cause immediate genetic erosion but altered dispersal dynamics and reproductive patterns. These findings underline the resilience of D. guianensis under current management practices, while emphasizing the need for long-term monitoring of regeneration to ensure sustainable recruitment and evolutionary resilience across logging cycles.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed a targeted gene deletion approach to investigate the role of sppA in F. columnare. The {Delta}sppA mutant exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes including increased outer membrane vesicle (OMV) production (3.8-fold higher compared to the wild type), reduced biofilm formation, and loss of gliding motility.

Importantly, the artificial infection experiment demonstrated the mutants significantly attenuated virulence in freshwater Medaka (Oryzias latipes), with a 20% higher survival rate of fish compared to the wild type. Our findings reveal that SppA is essential for maintaining membrane homeostasis in F. columnare and serves as one of the virulence factors during columnaris infection.

Despite its potential clinical relevance, the mechanisms governing dormancy initiation, maintenance and escape, as well as the molecular mediators involved, remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the interferon-inducible chemokine CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 as key regulators of immunological dormancy in breast cancer. By transcriptomic profiling we observed high expression of Cxcl10 in dormant cells in two different orthotopic, syngeneic models of breast cancer dormancy (D2.0R and 4T1-MR20). Genetic silencing of Cxcl10 in dormant cells or pharmacological blockade of CXCR3 in vivo, led to early tumor onset and rapid growth in immunocompetent mice. In contrast dormant cells effectively formed tumors in immune-deficient mice independently of Cxcl10 status, demonstrating that the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis-mediated dormancy requires a functional immune system. Further analysis confirmed that Cxcl10 silencing altered the local immune microenvironment, reducing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration while increasing the presence of granulocytic Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells and Natural Killer cells. Moreover, Cxcl10 silencing significantly increased the burden of tumor cells disseminated to the lung. Leveraging on these findings, we identified a CXCL10-mediated dormancy signature that predicts improved overall survival in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients.

While decades of research have mapped cortical circuits of attention, the causal roles of deep hubs such as the basal ganglia and thalamus remain poorly understood in the healthy human brain. Objectives/Hypothesis: To test whether low intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) of two nodes in the basal ganglia-thalamic network, the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and the pulvinar, causally alters visual attention. We hypothesized that TUS-induced modulations in attentional performance would be site specific, reflecting distinct circuit functions. Results: Across sessions, focal TUS accelerated reaction time in a visual search task, indicating augmented attention. Reaction time improvements were observed after stimulation relative to baseline. A dissociation emerged across sites: both GPi and pulvinar enhanced reaction times, but pulvinar yielded more robust benefits for target present trials at peripheral eccentricities, and improved search efficiency in the same trials.

Purpose This study investigated the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 in mediating the anticancer effects of Lantana camara extract. Study Design An in vitro experimental study was performed using MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells. Methods Cells were treated with the extract, and the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 was analyzed at mRNA and protein levels. Tumor suppressor gene expression was assessed at the mRNA level, and functional assays were conducted following DNMT1 overexpression to examine its impact on extract-induced effects. Expression of methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2, histone deacetylase 1, and histone deacetylase 2 was also evaluated at the mRNA level. Results The extract significantly downregulated DNA methyltransferase 1, resulting in the reactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes. Overexpression of DNA methyltransferase 1 reduced extract-induced G0/G1 arrest, attenuated apoptosis, and restored migration, while suppressing tumor suppressor gene expression. Additionally, the extract downregulated methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2, histone deacetylase 1, and histone deacetylase 2, suggesting broader modulation of epigenetic regulators. Conclusion Suppression of DNMT1 is a central mechanism underlying the anticancer activity of Lantana camara extract. These findings highlight its potential as a natural epigenetic modulator and a promising therapeutic candidate for TNBC.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

T.; Field, D. J.", "abstract": "Background: The phylogenetic relationships of fossil birds near the origin of the avian crown group remain debated, in part due to a limited amount of character evidence from incomplete fossils. The avian lower jaw provides a potentially rich source of additional character data, yet fusion of the individual bony elements composing the avian post-dentary complex has impeded efforts to explore its phylogenetic signal. Here, we use high-resolution CT-scanning to separate the individual bony elements of the mandibles of several immature crown birds and key fossil taxa, and use those data to assess support for alternative phylogenetic hypotheses for fossils near the origin of crown birds. Results: We find that evidence from Asteriornis fails to support interpretations of derived mandibular similarities with palaeognaths, and instead strongly favours galloanseran, and specifically galliform, affinities. Our results also illustrate striking similarities in the architecture of the lower jaws between the toothed ornithurine Ichthyornis, Pelagornithidae and Vegavis, which, in addition to the absence of derived features linking them to Galloanserae, highlights questions regarding the phylogenetic position of these perennially controversial taxa. Conclusions: Our data reveal new insight into patterns of morphological evolution near the origin of the avian crown group while raising new phylogenetic questions, emphasising the potential untapped value of detailed comparative investigations of morphological complexes such as the post-dentary complex of the mandible for informing the early evolutionary history of crown birds.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Using metabolomics, immunostaining, and flow cytometry, we evaluated glucose metabolic alterations and KCs death in a MASLD mouse model. Further investigation via immunostaining, Seahorse analysis, and {superscript 1}3C-glucose isotopic tracing elucidated the glucose metabolic mechanisms underlying KCs death. Here, we demonstrate that KCs death is a hallmark feature of MASLD progression across multiple dietary models, showing significantly higher susceptibility compared to other hepatic cell types. Through comprehensive metabolic profiling, we reveal that KCs undergo progressive glucose metabolic reprogramming during MASLD development, which is correlated with KCs death. In combination of biochemical agonist, isotope tracing and KCs culture, we further demonstrated that glycolysis metabolism activation directly contributes to KCs death in vitro. Additionally, using genetic ablation of Chi3l1 mouse, we further demonstrated that increased glucose utilization accelerate KCs death in vivo. Our findings establish a correlation between glucose metabolic dynamic changes and KCs death during MASLD progression, suggesting that modulation of glucose metabolic pathways may represent a strategy to prevent KCs death and thereby alleviate MASLD.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) show clinical promise, and the prevailing hypothesis is that their benefits are primarily driven by weight loss and the downstream benefits of improved functional status. We investigated the weight loss-independent effects of low-dose GLP-1RA therapy in a clinically relevant rodent model of severe cardiometabolic HFpEF. METHODS: Ten-week-old male ZSF1 obese rats with spontaneous HFpEF were treated with low-dose semaglutide (30 nmol/kg twice weekly, n=6) or vehicle for 16 weeks. Comprehensive assessments included body weight, 2-D echocardiography, invasive hemodynamics, exercise capacity as well as cardiac and hepatic fibrosis and lipid deposition. The study utilized advanced multi-omics approaches, including single-cell RNA sequencing of the heart and liver, as well as cardiac, hepatic and plasma proteomics, to explore underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: In ZSF1 obese rats, low-dose semaglutide in the absence of weight loss, significantly improved cardiac function, exercise tolerance, and attenuated fibrosis in the heart and liver. Interestingly, semaglutide therapy reduced cardiac and hepatic lipid content as well as lipid droplets in cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes. Mechanistically, multi-omics analyses of cardiac and hepatic tissues revealed that semaglutide exerted these benefits by improving cardiac metabolism, interfering with pro-fibrotic and pro-hypertrophic signals, and by reducing systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose semaglutide provides significant cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, and metabolic benefits in HFpEF independent of weight loss. Our findings support the investigation of lower GLP-1RA dosing in HFpEF and other cardiovascular conditions, including in non-obese patients, to expand the clinical utility of these potent drugs.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

This study reveals a reciprocal regulatory relationship between TOPPs and EIN2 (Ethylene insensitive 2)-mediated ethylene signaling. We identified that ethylene can induce TOPPs expression, and topp1/4/5 triple mutants exhibited partial ethylene insensitivity with reduced EIN3 protein levels and ERF1 (Ethylene response factor 1) expression. Mechanistically, TOPPs genetically act upstream of EIN2, physically interacting with its carboxyl-terminal domain (EIN2-C) to dephosphorylate the critical S655 residue. This site-specific dephosphorylation promotes EIN2 stability and EIN2-C nuclear accumulation, thereby activating ethylene responses. Notably, transgenic plants expressing phosphorylation-deficient EIN2S655A displayed constitutive ethylene responses and improved salt tolerance. Further investigation showed that EIN3/EIL1 (EIN3 like 1) transcriptionally activates TOPPs expression by binding to their promoter, amplifying ethylene signaling accordingly. Together, our finding establishes TOPPs play an important regulatory role in ethylene signal transduction and elucidate a dephosphorylation-switch mechanism in controlling EIN2 function, providing critical insight into the role of EIN2 post-translational modifications in plant stress adaptation.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

This species is also the single most damaging of a group of agriculturally important plant-parasites, which together are estimated to contribute to losses in excess of $170 billion/year to world agriculture. Understanding how M. incognita is able to infect representatives from most orders of flowering plants, covering more than 3000 species, addresses a fundamentally important question of how pathogens adapt to their host-environment, and may inform control of a pathogen which threatens global food security. Here, we analyse the plant-nematode infection phenotype, and cross-kingdom transcriptome, of nine interactions across six orders of flowering plants at 25 days post infection. At this stage, majority of nematodes found within roots were immature and mature females (49.2% - 91.8%). Our data show that the phylogenetic distribution of hosts does not explain the phenotypic distribution of parasitism. Interestingly, though, M. incognita do have distinct transcriptional responses to different groups of hosts, but in a pattern which is independent of host phylogenetic. Three distinct nematode transcriptional programmes - Group 1, 2, and 3 - are evident, and we find that effectors are neither uniformly deployed across hosts, nor across groups of hosts. Importantly, we show that this differential deployment of effectors can have profound consequences for host specificity. Finally, we show that there is essentially no widespread core gall transcriptome at 25 days post infection, prompting the proposal of a model best described as all roads lead to Rome.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

K.; Livingstone, M. S.; Weiner, K. S.; Arcaro, M. J.", "abstract": "Neural activity requires energy metabolism, and the brain's metabolic architecture varies across regions. Yet, it remains unclear whether these variations are meaningfully related to the functional and perceptual demands of cortical processing. In high-level visual cortex, category-selective regions, such as those preferentially responding to faces and scenes, are consistently distributed along a topographic axis that varies in sensitivity to spatial scale, a feature dimension that imposes differing metabolic demands at the level of the retina. This axis reflects a broader organizing principle of the visual system: retinotopic eccentricity, the topographic mapping of visual space relative to gaze. Here, we tested whether cortical metabolic architecture reflects this principle by aligning in vivo fMRI maps of eccentricity and visual category selectivity with ex vivo cytochrome oxidase (CO) histology, a marker of oxidative metabolism, in macaque visual cortex. We found that face-selective region ML, which is biased toward central vision, exhibits higher CO intensity than the peripherally-biased scene-selective region LPP. More broadly, CO intensity covaries with eccentricity across the entire occipitotemporal cortex, though this gradient only partially accounts for the elevated CO in ML. These findings reveal a close correspondence between cortical energy consumption and retinotopic representation, suggesting that metabolic resources are shaped by the processing demands of visual perception.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Locomotor perturbations elicit cortical and muscular responses that help minimize motor errors through neural processes involving multiple brain regions. The anterior cingulate cortex monitors motor errors, the supplementary motor areas integrate sensory and executive control, and the posterior parietal cortices process sensorimotor predictions, while muscles show increased activation and co-contraction patterns. With aging, these neural control strategies shift; older adults demonstrate less flexible cortical and muscular responses, using compensatory overactivation and simpler muscle synergies to maintain performance comparable to young adults. We investigated corticomuscular connectivity patterns during perturbed recumbent stepping in seventeen young adults (age 25{+/-}4.9 years) and eleven older adults (age 68{+/-}3.6 years) using high-density EEG (128 electrodes) and EMG from six bilateral muscles. Brief mechanical perturbations (200ms of increased resistance) were applied at left or right leg extension-onset or mid-extension during continuous stepping at 60 steps per minute. We applied independent component analysis, source localization, and direct directed transfer function to quantify bidirectional information flow between cortical clusters and muscles in theta (3-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) bands. Young adults demonstrated concentrated electrocortical sources in anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral supplementary motor areas, and bilateral posterior parietal cortices, with strong theta-band synchronization following perturbations. In contrast, older adults showed fewer differentiated cortical sources, particularly lacking distinct anterior cingulate activity, and exhibited only minimal synchronization changes. Baseline corticomuscular connectivity was significantly stronger in older adults compared to young adults (p=0.012), suggesting fundamental differences in resting motor control states. During perturbations, young adults employed flexible, task-specific connectivity modulation involving error-processing networks, with the anterior cingulate showing selective bidirectional connectivity changes with specific muscles. Older adults relied on more diffuse (i.e., not focused to specific brain area) connectivity patterns dominated by motor and posterior parietal cortices, with strong connections to multiple upper and lower limb muscles simultaneously. These findings reveal an age-related strategic reorganization from dynamic, error-driven neural control to a more constrained, stability-focused approach that may reflect compensation for sensorimotor changes. The distinct connectivity signatures establish perturbed recumbent stepping as a valuable tool for assessing corticomuscular communication and provide normative benchmarks for developing targeted rehabilitation interventions to restore efficient motor control in aging and neurological populations.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD. There are currently 238 known genetic susceptibility loci for the development of IBD. The physiological impact of the majority of these loci remain a gap in our knowledge. One such locus is the single nucleotide polymorphism rs1077773, located ~56kbp downstream from the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene. AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is crucial to maintaining intestinal homeostasis. We hypothesized that rs1077773 enhances AHR activity to regulate mucosal immune response and maintain intestinal homeostasis. Methods: All study procedures and reagents were approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board (#202011003). Patient biopsies were collected at Barnes Jewish Hospital and genotyped using the IBD Genetics Consortium custom GSA SNP chip (Broad Institute) followed by imputation using TopMed Imputation Server at University of Michigan. Patient derived organoids (PDOs; N=3 G/G, N=4 G/A, N=5 A/A) were derived and maintained in 3D culture and supplemented with 50% L-WRN conditioned medium with passage every 3-4 days as previously described. PDOs were treated with AHR agonist 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) or vehicle for 48h. Expression of AHR and its transcriptional targets Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and CYP1B1 was assessed by RT-qPCR. Blood was collected from pediatric patients undergoing intestinal resection and was genotyped with custom TaqMan SNP assay (N=3 G/G, N=5 G/A). Peripheral blood monocytes differentiated into macrophages (PBM{Phi}s) were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of AHR ligands FICZ or indole-3-carboxaldehyde for 24h. Cytokine levels in culture supernatant were measured via using the ProcartaPlex human cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor 45-plex (ThermoFisher) on a Luminex FLEXMAP3D instrument. Results: AHR expression was consistent across genotypes. PDOs homozygous for rs1077773 alternate allele (A/A) demonstrate enhanced CYP1A1 expression in response to AHR activation. In PBM{Phi}s, cytokine secretion was stimulated by LPS treatment and was abrogated by FICZ treatment. PBM{Phi}s with rs1077773 alternate allele demonstrated significant reduction in secretion of 17 cytokines and chemokines. Conclusions: This work demonstrates that rs1077773 is an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for AHR activity and modulates epithelial and immune cell function in vitro. Further mechanistic understanding of this locus and its correlates could improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IBD susceptibility and may lead to novel personalized therapeutic approaches in IBD.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Diversity loss has been interpreted through the niche dimension hypothesis, yet the mechanistic link via competitive effects remains unresolved. Establishing this link demands a global synthesis of how nutrients alter competitive effects, defined as a species ability to perform better or worse with heterospecific competitors than with conspecifics. Strong competitive effects from heterospecifics relative to conspecifics can lead to decline or exclusion of the focal species, whereas weaker competitive effects indicate niche differentiation that promotes coexistence. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 71 plant competition experiments to quantify how nutrient addition alters competitive effects, using biomass as the performance metric. Nutrient addition intensified competitive effects with heterospecifics by 1.5 fold, as focal species biomass was higher with conspecifics. Responses depended on the initial competitive effect under low nutrients, when effects were weak, nutrient addition increased biomass with conspecifics, and when effects were strong, nutrient addition increased biomass with heterospecifics, alleviating competition and potentially countering species loss. Competitive effects were amplified most when higher temperatures occurred in dry quarters, suggesting nutrient additions may exacerbate competition under extreme climate conditions. Understanding these interactive effects of nutrient addition, changing climate, and competition is critical for predicting plant responses to global change in both managed and natural ecosystems.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "High elevation populations are expected to receive reduced snowpack, warmer temperatures, and more variable precipitation patterns, potentially putting them at risk if rates of adaptation do not keep pace with climate change. Populations from climates more closely aligned with the changing high elevation conditions may prove better suited to current climate than the current local populations. Thus, it is essential to assess 1) whether high elevation populations are locally adapted to current climate, and 2) whether fitness of lower elevation populations from warmer climates is higher than for local populations in high elevation conditions. We conducted a common garden study with Streptanthus tortuosus at a high elevation site. Twenty-three populations from across the species range were measured weekly for mortality, and reproductive output was measured at the end of the growing season. We examined the effects of climatic distance from the site of origin on plant performance. The effects of weekly weather on mortality were also assessed. We observed adaptational lag for high elevation populations, including the native population, but only for some life stages. Low elevation populations had higher survival through the first year and over winter. Additionally, the probability of reproducing was highest for populations from the warmest climates. Warmer ambient temperatures at the high elevation garden were also associated with higher weekly mortality across populations. However, survival to reproduction in the second year was higher in populations from climates closer to the garden, i.e. high elevation populations. Thus, adaptational lag differed among life stages. Synthesis: This study highlights the importance of considering variation in life history and seasonal conditions when evaluating how species that occur across an elevational gradient may respond to climate change. This adds to a growing body of evidence that reveals warming temperatures as a threat to high elevation populations. However, unlike previous studies, this threat was not consistent across life stages. These results suggest that strategic assisted gene flow that combines the benefits of warm-adapted low elevation populations with the benefits of snow-adapted life history from high elevation populations may be beneficial in this species, and similar systems.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

However, existing approaches do not permit precise control over the lateral focusing position of cells. By leveraging engineered microvortices generated by channel ridges and fluidic lift forces, we present a microfluidic method for deterministically positioning focused cell streams to desired lateral streamlines. Unlike inertial focusing, the ridge-assisted micro positioning (RAMP) is independent of particle size and flow rate, enabling polydisperse particles (10 to 30 m) to be focused to the same streamline across a broad range of flow rates (250 to 1000 L/min). The focusing position can be precisely adjusted by altering ridge placement and geometry, achieving both small (5 m) and large ([&ge;]15 m) lateral shifts in a controlled manner. Applying the RAMP concept, we developed clog-free microfluidic cell concentrators that can enrich single cells and clusters of cells to desired concentration factors and demonstrate the ability to focus particles in undiluted whole blood.

Despite decades of research, the 5-year survival rate is 50%, and strikingly, the overall incidence rate is projected to increase by 30% in the next ten years, which will result in a sharp increase in mortality. Two fundamental aspects of OSCC are that it progresses via the inactivation and mutation of tumor suppressor (TS) genes and has a cold tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). A major barrier in the treatment of OSCC is the lack of novel therapies clinicians have at their disposal that are designed to disrupt tumor progression by reshaping the cold tumors into inflammatory or hot tumors. To overcome these obstacles, we employed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that co-encapsulates p53 mRNA and the small molecule ciclopirox (CPX). We demonstrate that both drugs have innate chemotherapeutic properties by facilitating caspase activation. Moreover, these therapies can create a less immunosuppressive TIME in part by repolarizing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to M1-like phenotypes. When formulated together, our platform provides an all-in-one approach for OSCC, effective in both p53-therapy-susceptible and p53-therapy-resistant models. Additionally, this work provides a template for a delivery platform capable of tackling multiple mechanisms of OSCC progression and survival.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Today, images of biological structures can be acquired using different imaging technologies and at increasing resolutions. However, identifying relevant structural features in three-dimensional (3D) images remains a significant challenge. 3D image segmentation is usually performed using deep-learning segmentation models. Such models are trained on manually annotated and segmented, dataset-specific images. Consequently, they rarely generalize across datasets. Here, we overcome these limitations with TopoTome, an unsupervised 3D image segmentation and analysis algorithm. TopoTome is based on topological data analysis, and conceptually distinct from standard clustering and deep learning image analysis models. It encodes the 3D image directly in topological space. Then, it performs unsupervised clustering to detect and segment features represented by salient and spatially coherent voxel intensity gradients. We demonstrate on simple, complex, synthetic and real-world 3D image data that it outperforms all 3D clustering algorithms. Its segmentation ranks with or outperforms best-in-class deep learning 3D image segmentation software. Beyond image segmentation, it provides streamlined topological data analysis of 3D images, advancing 3D image analysis from conventional mesh volumetry to structural topology. Owing to its conceptually different topological data analysis core, TopoTome does not need prior information and tuning to generalize across different imaging modalities, including fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. We show it also readily generalizes across biological subjects, such as different species, organs and cells. TopoTome is thus one of the most versatile and accurate unsupervised 3D image segmentation algorithms.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, we evaluated top-down and middle-down MS approaches for enhancing proteoform sequence coverage using three proteins: ubiquitin, myoglobin, and carbonic anhydrase II. In the top-down MS approach, we applied in-source fragmentation (ISF) to generate pseudo-MS3 spectra, thereby improving sequence coverage. For the middle-down MS strategy, we performed short-duration enzymatic digestions to produce longer peptides that preserve more proteoform sequence information.

J.; Lertpoompunya, A.; Eddins, D. A.; Higgins, N. C.", "abstract": "Head movements play a pivotal role while engaged in multi-talker conversation by providing non-verbal feedback to partners and enhancing a listeners ability to separate sound sources. Commercial hearing-aids with an on-board IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit, i.e., accelerometers) typically use that information for step-counting and activity levels. At least one device uses it as an input to their environment classifier and integrated directional microphone. None, however, use the IMU to detect specific patterns of head movements to predict behaviors such as nodding, head shaking, listening to a person versus a video, or talking. Training an automatic classifier to accurately detect these behaviors first requires collecting head movement data during multi-person conversation and laboriously annotating each behavior-type for each participant with high temporal precision. From that point, with the goal of training the most accurate model and integrating with the hardware in the hearing aid to improve device performance, the question is how best to model the data. To address this gap, we collected accelerometer data during natural multi-person conversations and paired it with detailed human annotations of communication and head-movement behaviors. Head-movement data was collected from three cohorts of young, normal-hearing individuals (three per cohort) in a controlled, conference-room setting during 50-minute multi-talker conversations. Participants wore hearing aids with on-board accelerometers, and audio-video was recorded for each talker. Videos were manually annotated for communication and head-movement behaviors, including conversational turns and nonverbal cues such as tilts and nods. Temporal and spectral features were extracted from the accelerometer data (windowed into 1-second segments) corresponding to roll and pitch movements. These features, combined with the annotated behaviors, were used to train and test machine learning models. Models were trained on data from all but one participant and then tested on the held-out participant, repeating this procedure across all individuals. Several deep learning and classical machine learning models were compared for classifying communication behaviors (e.g., talking, listening, watching video) and head orientations (e.g., turning left or right, facing down, facing forward). More specifically, various sequence-to-sequence models, a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, were utilized. These models incorporated modern architectural components such as transformer networks. Multiple performance metrics were used to evaluate models, and results suggest that modern deep learning models outperform classical machine learning methods by significant margins. Classification performance improved further when temporal sequence information was incorporated. These results indicate that during multi-talker conversation, hearing-aid accelerometers can automatically classify stereotypical behaviors with high temporal resolution (1-second). Even when tested on unseen subjects, the models remained reliable. This establishes a foundation for more advanced approaches that combine behavioral and movement patterns, further integrate temporal dynamics, and incorporate additional inputs to improve accuracy and ecological validity.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Aboveground and belowground trait covariation can be affected by environmental conditions such as the location of available water. Here, we investigated the effects of watering regime on trait covariation in Silphium (Asteraceae), an emerging perennial oilseed crop. Methods: Silphium integrifolium Michx. and S. perfoliatum L. are native North American species adapted to well-drained and moist soils, respectively. Using a backcrossed F1 hybrid S. integrifolium x S. perfoliatum population, we conducted a greenhouse experiment where plants were either watered at the soil line (top-watered) or from below using watering trays (bottom-watered). Aboveground biomass, root distribution, and root morphology (e.g., specific root length) were measured destructively. Key results: Compared to top-watered plants, bottom-watered plants were smaller aboveground and belowground, with a higher proportion of roots in the upper portions of the pots and higher specific root length. Negative relationships between aboveground biomass and specific root length were steeper for bottom-watered than top-watered plants. Conclusions: The location of available water impacts aboveground biomass, the distribution and morphology of the root system, and relationships between aboveground and belowground plant structures. This work suggests that resource allocation depends in part on the location of available water, and has relevance for ongoing efforts aimed at developing perennial, herbaceous species that offer both economically viable products as well as ecosystem services.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response, the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast a T-cell response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation, proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. We demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different immune signals. This model explains experimentally observed patterns of T-cell effector expansion regulation in mice. Extending our model to immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the affinity for tumor antigens (\"quality\") and the abundance (\"quantity\") of infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment.

By analyzing the dynamic changes of MuSCs at the molecular (scRNA-Seq and Cell Painting) and phenotypic (heteromotility) level at single cell resolution we found that the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) Pathway is a critical regulator of MuSC transition states. Aged MuSCs have increased baseline ISR activity in quiescence that does not increase during activation to levels observed in adult MuSCs. Rapid and transient pharmacological ISR activation in vitro was sufficient to increase aged MuSC activation rate and migratory behavior as well as alter the transcriptional states toward a younger phenotype. ISR activation also improved aged MuSC potency and aged mouse muscle regeneration in vivo. Therefore, pharmacological activation of the ISR has therapeutic potential to improve MuSC function and skeletal muscle repair during aging.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Despite significant advances in assembling T. cruzi genomes, major gaps remain. Among these, the complete repertoire of centromeric sequences has remained elusive, representing a critical missing piece in our understanding of chromosome structure and inheritance. Results: Here, we generated high-coverage Hi-C (genome-wide chromosome conformation capture) data for the widely used T. cruzi Dm28c strain improving its genome assembly, reducing the number of scaffolds and producing a more contiguous and accurate genome. To investigate centromere organization, we performed ChIP-seq using the mNeonGreen-myc-tagged kinetochore proteins KKT2 and KKT3, resulting in the identification of 40 KKT-enriched peaks across 29 scaffolds. These peaks were located in regions enriched in retrotransposable elements, particularly L1Tc and VIPER, near strand switch regions, areas of high GC content, and at the boundaries between conserved genes and virulence-factor multigene families. Conclusion: Notably, Hi-C analysis revealed that centromeres may act as structural boundaries contributing to genome compartmentalization and frequently engage in 3D spatial clustering, suggesting a role in higher-order nuclear architecture. Overall, our study provides a high-quality reference genome for the Dm28c strain, presents the first genome-wide centromere map in T. cruzi, and offers novel insights into centromere-mediated 3D genome organization", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Our group has previously demonstrated that amyloid fibrils (AFs), regardless of their protein composition, induce NET release in vitro in human neutrophils through a process dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX-2). Moreover, the proteases embedded in NETs were shown to degrade AFs into smaller, potentially toxic species. The present study aimed to determine whether amyloid fibrils composed of -synuclein (SF) can induce NET formation in vivo and to investigate the role of NETs in modulating amyloid-associated pathology. To this end, we employed gp91phox knockout (KO) mice, which lack NOX-2 activity and are therefore unable to release NETs. SF was instilled into the lungs of both WT and KO mice (males and females), leveraging the lung robust immune cell recruitment, particularly of neutrophils, as a model system. Eight hours after SF instillation, both WT and KO animals exhibited marked neutrophil infiltration in the lungs causing inflammation. However, NET formation, evidenced by the presence of citrullinated histones and myeloperoxidase, was detected only in WT mice. Interestingly, while Congo red-positive amyloid-like structures persisted in the lungs of KO mice, they were absent in the lungs of WT animals, suggesting that NET-associated proteases facilitate the clearance of AFs from lung tissue. Lung function was assessed by measuring elastance and resistance. Our data showed that, while AFs were still present in the lungs of both WT and KO mice, elastance was impaired. As AFs were cleared from the lungs of WT mice, lung function recovered. In contrast, KO animals, in which AFs persisted, continued to exhibit compromised elastance. Together, our findings demonstrate that AFs impair lung function, and that NETs, induced in response to these fibrils, promote their degradation and thereby protect lung tissue from further damage.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

To enhance sequencing speed and efficiency, Illumina has shifted from the four-color base calling chemistry of the HiSeq series to a two-color fluorescent dye chemistry in the NovaSeq series. Benchmarking sequencing artifacts due to biases in the newer chemistry is important to evaluate the quality of identified mutations. We re-analyzed a series of whole-genome sequencing experiments in which the same samples were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 (two-color) and HiSeq X10 (four-color) platforms by independent groups. In several samples, we observed a higher frequency of T-to-G and A-to-C substitutions (\"T>G\") at the read level for NovaSeq 6000 versus HiSeq X10. As the per-base error rate is still low, the artifactual substitutions have a negligible effect in identifying germline or high variant allele frequency (VAF) somatic mutations. However, such errors can confound the detection of low-VAF somatic variants in high-depth sequencing samples, particularly in studies of mosaic mutations in normal tissues, where variants have low read support and are called without a matched normal. The artifactual T>G variant calls disproportionately occur at NT[TG] trinucleotides, and we leveraged this observation to bioinformatically reduce the T>G excess in somatic mutation callsets. We identified a recurrent artifact specific to the Illumina two-color chemistry platform on the NovaSeq 6000 with the potential to contaminate low-VAF somatic mutation calls. Thus, an unexpected enrichment of T>G mutations in mosaicism studies warrants caution.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

The regulatory AMPK{gamma} subunit plays a central role in energy sensing. While the skeletal muscle-selective {gamma}3 isoform is essential for AMP/ZMP-induced glucose uptake, it is dispensable for ADaM site-binding activators. We hypothesized that the predominant {gamma}1 isoform is required for ADaM site activator-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Methods: Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on mouse and human skeletal muscle mapping AMPK subunit isoform distribution across resident cell types. To determine {gamma} isoform-specific requirements for activator-stimulated glucose uptake, skeletal muscle-specific inducible AMPK{gamma}1/{gamma}3 double knockout (im{gamma}1-/-/{gamma}3-/-) and single knockout (im{gamma}1-/- and im{gamma}3-/-) mice were generated. Ex vivo glucose uptake was measured following treatment with AICAR (AMP-mimetic) or MK-8722 (ADaM site activator), and in vivo MK-8722-induced blood glucose lowering was assessed. Results: snRNA-seq revealed distinct AMPK isoform distribution: {gamma}1 was ubiquitously expressed, whereas {gamma}3 was enriched in glycolytic myofibers in both mouse and human skeletal muscle. Ex vivo, glucose uptake stimulated by either AICAR or MK-8722 was abolished in im{gamma}1-/-/{gamma}3-/- muscle, and MK-8722-induced blood glucose lowering was significantly blunted in vivo.

Although prior work suggests that action potential recordings can be re-quantized to approximately the signal-to-noise (SNR) number of bits without significantly degrading decoding performance, our results show that the required resolution can often be reduced even further. By matching the number of quantization levels to the electrode's maximum SNR (the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of the signal-to-noise ratio number of bits), we retain waveform fidelity while eliminating unnecessary precision that primarily captures noise. Recorded spike samples are selected using a mutual information-based criterion to preserve both spatial and temporal discriminative waveform features.

SLiMs play central roles in signaling, trafficking, and post-translational regulation, but their short length and low complexity make them difficult to identify both experimentally and computationally. Since the latest release of motif discovery tools like MEME Suite, the availability of protein-protein interaction data (e.g., BioGRID) has increased by more than fivefold, providing richer network contexts where SLiMs can be inferred from recurring patterns of interaction. Combined with recent advances in machine learning, this creates new opportunities for large-scale, high-resolution motif discovery. Results: We present FiGS-MoD, a Feature-informed Gibbs Sampling Motif Discovery algorithm with two key innovations: (i) incorporating biased sampling informed by residue-level features, including Protein Language Model (PLM) embeddings, AlphaFold2-derived disorder and solvent accessibility, and evolutionary conservation, and (ii) replacing the traditional position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) with a Hidden Markov model (HMM) to accommodate insertions and deletions.

However, resistance to checkpoint inhibitors creates an opportunity for patients to benefit from novel immunotherapies. The type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13 and TSLP have been implicated in suppressing anti-tumor immune responses through T and myeloid cells. Our current study tested whether combined therapeutic blockade of IL-4, IL-13 and TSLP improved anti-tumor immunity alone and in combination with PD1 antagonism. Methods: We used in vitro experiments with primary cells to identify cell types likely to participate in controlling tumors upon IL-4, IL-13, TSLP and PD1 blockade. Therapeutic blockade in the subcutaneous CT26 model tested in vivo tumor growth inhibition and associated immunological changes. Bioinformatic analysis of human tumor bulk RNA sequencing data probed for survival associations with IL-4/IL-13 and TSLP transcriptional responses. Results: In vitro, IL-4 suppressed T cell-mediated tumor growth inhibition and reduced monocyte-derived dendritic cell expression of proteins associated with anti-tumor immunity. In vivo, blocking IL-4, IL-13, TSLP and PD1 improved tumor growth inhibition by creating hotter tumors. This was associated with repolarization of CD4 and CD8 T cells and shifts in monocyte, conventional type 1 and type 2 (or monocyte-derived) dendritic cell programs. Transcriptional responses to IL-4/IL-13 and TSLP were associated with poor survival outcomes across patients with several types of cancers. Conclusion: Therapeutic blockade of IL-4, IL-13 and TSLP may drive immunological tumor growth inhibition in subsets of cancer patients alone and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Improved tumor growth inhibition was likely driven through augmented cytotoxic T cell priming in secondary lymphoid organs and improved reactivation by repolarized monocytes and dendritic cells in tumors.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Notably, distinct microbial signatures have been identified across cancer types. Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancer, yet its microbiome remains unclear. Analyzing the bacteriome composition in tissue from ten SCLC cases and in 10 cases of a heterogenous lung pathology group, we found a distinct microbial signature associated with SCLC with significantly lower diversity and higher dissimilarity, characterized by a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, and a markedly different set of dominant genera (Pseudomonas, Streptococcus and Haemophilus) resulting in an increased Proteobacteria-to-Actinobacteria ratio. Unexpectedly, mycobiome analysis comparing pooled samples of these SCLC cases with ten pooled lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cases revealed that the fungal genus Taphrina was uniquely represented in SCLC. Strikingly, mycobiome individual analysis of twenty-one additional SCLC cases compared with 10 LUAD cases showed an increased prevalence of Taphrina sp. in SLCL tissue. Overall, the results suggest that SCLC microbiome is distinct from other lung pathologies and uncovers a novel link between the biotrophic plant pathogenic Taphrina and human cancer.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

The clinic trial tested tumor vascular regulator CD248 has been validated as a potential anti-fibrotic target in ischemic heart injury. We therefore tested the hypothesis that targeting Cd248 specifically in Postn+ myofibroblasts ameliorates pressure-overload cardiomyopathy. Methods: Single-cell RNA-sequencing data from murine hearts subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) were analyzed to quantify the Cd248+/Postn+ fibroblast population. Subsequently, Postn+ myofibroblast-specific inducible Cd248 knockout mice were subjected to TAC. Gene deletion was induced with tamoxifen from the day of surgery. Cardiac remodeling and function were analyzed 8 weeks after TAC. Results: Analysis of scRNAseq data confirmed that about 1/3 of the fibroblasts in the 14-day TAC heart are Cd248+Postn+ fibroblasts. However, comprehensive echocardiographic analysis revealed no significant differences in key parameters of cardiac function or dimensions, including left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular volumes, wall thickness and global muscle strain between PostnMCM+/-;Cd248fl/fl and PostnMCM+/- controls. Histological analysis at 8 weeks also showed no significant alteration in the extent of interstitial or perivascular fibrosis, myocardial vessel density, or cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Conclusion: The specific deletion of Cd248 in Postn-expressing myofibroblasts does not mitigate pathological remodeling or fibrosis in response to chronic pressure overload. These findings suggest the role of Cd248 in this cell lineage is not a primary driver of pressure-overload pathology. Therefore, a better understanding of the context-dependent functions of CD248 is critical to successfully guide the clinical translation of CD248-based anti-fibrotic therapies.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

A field trial with randomized complete block design was conducted on Adkins fine sandy loam soil to evaluate the impact of application of manure and synthetic fertilizer on nutrient concentrations (N, P, K and S) in plant and soil and field corn yield. Experimental treatments included an application of synthetic fertilizer (NPK) and dairy manure application at 5-, 10- and 15- tons acre-1 in addition to a non-fertilized control. All the manure was applied before planting. Corn was manually harvested, and plants were separated into leaves, stems and cobs to determine dry weights. Post harvest soil sampling was performed at 0-30, 30-60 and 60-90 cm soil depths. Results indicated that in-season leaf nutrient concentration was significantly different among applied treatments. Application of synthetic fertilizer resulted in the highest plant height (116 in) and produced higher corn yield (45.5 tons acre-1) compared to control and application of dairy manure. Application of manure at 5 tons acre-1 produced higher corn yield (35.5 tons acre-1) compared to manure application at 10 (25.9 tons acre-1) and 15 tons acre-1 (26.1 tons acre-1). A similar trend was observed for leaf, stem and cobs fresh and dry weights. Nutrient recovery was higher under application of synthetic fertilizer followed by application of manure at 5 tons acre-1. Soil nutrient analysis indicated no significant impact on N, P, K and S concentration among treatments except for ammonium-N. However, nutrient concentration significantly varied under different soil depths. Results suggest that a combination of synthetic fertilizer application and manure might be a practical approach for balanced nutrient supply for field corn. Further investigations are necessary to explore the potential of manure application to ensure balanced nutrient supply, improved yields and reduced nutrient losses in field corn.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

G.; Pahng, S. H.; Shao, C. X.; Ye, J.; Budjan, C.; Hormoz, S.", "abstract": "The establishment of the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis is the first symmetry-breaking event in mammalian development, transforming initially uniform cell populations into a polarized body plan. Gastruloids, aggregates of embryonic stem cells, recapitulate this transition by reproducibly forming a posterior primitive-streak-like pole. To investigate the underlying physical principles, we constructed a coarse-grained agent-based model representing two radially differentiated cell populations - outer/peripheral and inner/core - interacting via short-range adhesion/surface tension and optional long-range, chemotaxis-like forces. Systematic exploration of this morphogenetic landscape revealed that adhesion alone cannot robustly generate a single axis, often leading to weak or unstable asymmetries. By contrast, introducing long-range attraction among peripheral cells markedly broadened the parameter space for robust symmetry breaking, yielding high morphological asymmetry with minimal cell loss. We further implement a minimal, modular gene regulatory network that partitions cells into outer vs. inner states and gates adhesion and peripheral long-range attraction, converting an inside-outside bias into a stable axis. To facilitate further exploration, we developed DevSim, a user-friendly platform for simulating coupled genetic-mechanical rules in multicellular systems. Our results suggest that cooperative short- and long-range interactions are necessary design principles for reliable A-P axis formation in gastruloids and provide a framework for dissecting and engineering self-organizing developmental systems.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

How do memories that are seemingly inaccessible persistently influence cognitive processes and behaviors throughout life? Rodent studies have demonstrated that forgotten infantile memories remain encoded as latent \"infantile memory engrams\" (iEngrams) within neuronal circuits, capable of memory reinstatement under artificial experimental conditions. Still, the network mechanisms underpinning the natural reinstatement of a forgotten infantile memory are unknown. Here, we show that infantile memories, though physiologically irretrievable in adults, remain stored within hippocampal circuits and their engrams contribute to hippocampal network dynamics. Crucially, reinstating these memories requires a carefully orchestrated network process. An initial contextual reminder primes the hippocampal network to increase activity of the iEngram during a subsequent aversive reminder, which tags iEngram neurons for offline reactivation. This reactivation facilitates the integration of previously latent infantile memories with novel neuronal ensembles, reinstating behavior consistent with the original memory. These findings critically advance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying physiological memory encoding, retrieval, and reinstatement across development. Furthermore, they delineate the temporal boundaries and underlying physiological substrate of the process by which a latent representation becomes associated with a novel neuronal substrate, suggesting potential interventions to prevent the maladaptive reinstatement of traumatic infantile memories.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Prior studies report mixed associations between attention and language, raising the possibility that these links are explained by aphasia severity. We examined whether alerting, orienting, and executive control attention differ by aphasia severity and whether severity mediates their relationship with sentence comprehension. Methods: Fifty-eight PWA (latent, mild, moderate, severe) and 21 neurotypical controls completed the Attention Network Test, Western Aphasia Battery-Revised, and a sentence-picture matching task. Group differences were tested with ANOVA and linear mixed-effects models. Correlations and structural equation modeling evaluated associations among attention, aphasia severity, and sentence comprehension efficiency. Results: Orienting and executive control differed by aphasia severity, with the severe group performing worse than all others; alerting did not differ across groups. Within group analyses showed that controls and mild aphasia participants demonstrated all three effects, latent aphasia participants showed orienting and executive control effects, while the moderate and severe groups only showed the executive control effect. Stronger orienting and executive control correlated with milder aphasia and more efficient canonical comprehension. Mediation confirmed that orienting influenced canonical and non-canonical comprehension indirectly through aphasia severity; executive control showed trend-level mediation. Alerting attention was unrelated to aphasia severity or comprehension. Conclusions: Orienting and executive control, but not alerting, are closely tied to aphasia severity and indirectly support sentence comprehension.

I.", "abstract": "Background: Diarrhoeal diseases remain the second leading cause of preventable death globally, particularly among children under the age of five in developing countries, accounting for an estimated 2-3 million deaths annually. Among the bacterial pathogens causing diarrheal illness, Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) remains one of the major contributors, particularly in LMICs. As a common gut pathogen, C. jejuni expresses several secretory or surface-expressed colonisation proteins, namely Hcp, VgrG, CadF, FlpA, and JlpA. Most of these proteins play pivotal roles in bacterial self-survival, host-cell adhesion, and invasion in avian and non-avian hosts. Methods: To minimise the C. jejuni adhesion and subsequent colonisation in the avian gut, we explored the potential of a multivalent mucosal vaccine composition using these putative subunits of C. jejuni. For this purpose, we bioengineered a food-grade Lactic Acid-producing Bacterium, Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), to express three key immunogenic subunits, Hcp, CadF and JlpA. Utilising this live vector-based multi-component mucosal vaccine platform, we investigated the immunoprotective potential of these antigens in chickens. Since the particular strain of L. lactis is non-colonising, we used chitosan as a natural mucoadhesive, biodegradable polymer to microencapsulate the engineered bacteria to increase their gut retention time for optimal interaction with local immune cells. Results: Our in vivo immunisation study demonstrated that oral administration of this multivalent vaccine formulation elicited a strong local antibody response (sIgA) and upregulated key pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to robust mucosal immune protection against the cecal colonisation of C. jejuni. Moreover, gut metagenomic analysis of vaccinated birds revealed a marked reduction in the phylum Campylobacterota, accompanied by an increased abundance of the phyla Bacillota and Bacteroidota, as part of a beneficial microbial community. Conclusions: Together, this study underscores the potential of a live vector-based, multivalent mucosal vaccine as a promising, cost-effective strategy to reduce the risk of foodborne transmission of C. jejuni, particularly in poultry production systems.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, we integrated whole-organ tissue-clearing imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and proteomics to construct a multimodal atlas of the mandibular microenvironment in both mouse and human BRONJ. Our findings revealed gross vascular and lymphatic rarefaction in BRONJ, along with 4 endothelial subtypes uniformly exhibiting aberrant upregulation of Col2a1. Moreover, fibroblasts and macrophages emerged as key endothelial interactors, collectively underscoring dysregulation of the endothelium-matrix-immune axis. Unlike homeostatic Dmp1/Tfap2a fibroblasts and Stab1 macrophages, BRONJ lesions featured pathological Lrrc15/Chad fibroblasts and Il6 macrophages, which promote ectopic chondrogenesis and inflammation. Mechanistically, BRONJ activated the COL2A1-CD44 axis (EC-to-fibroblast/macrophage signaling) and COL2A1-SDC4 axis (EC-to-fibroblast signaling), whereas lineage tracing excluded endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), implicating extracellular matrix remodeling as the driver of dysfunction. Cross-species validation in human mandibles further confirmed vascular-lymphatic dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and aberrant chondrogenesis. Overall, this study establishes vascular and lymphatic dysfunction as a central pathological hallmark of BRONJ, driving matrix remodeling dysregulation and immune-inflammatory imbalance, and identifies the COL2A1-CD44/SDC4 axis as a potential therapeutic target for BRONJ.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

We and others have reported a failure of AT2 regeneration and a loss of AT2 cells in IPF. We recently further reported that there is a defect in lipid metabolism in IPF AT2 cells and we discovered a selective loss of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) in AT2 cells from IPF, as well as in AT2 cells from bleomycin-injured mice. Pharmacological and genetic experiments confirm that LPCAT1 is required for AT2 cell renewal in 3D organoid assays. AT2 cell-specific Lpcat1 deletion resulted in reduced AT2 renewal, spontaneous lung fibrosis, and heightened susceptibility to bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice in vivo. Expression-based high-content drug screening with an LPCAT1 knock-in cell line identified several drug families that upregulated LPCAT1 expression. We further confirmed that anti-malarial artesunate and PLA2 inhibitor ONO-RS-082 increased LPCAT1 mRNA expression, promoted AT2 renewal, and attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice in vivo.

Transmission kernels based on inter-farm Euclidean distances are developed to estimate the probability of between-farm transmission and to reconstruct the likely transmission network. Several kernel formulations are evaluated, and parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation techniques. We further assess the influence of isolation interventions by incorporating time-dependent kernel modifications that reflect reduced transmission risk following farm visits. Local transmission potential is quantified through farm-specific reproduction numbers, and transmission pathways are inferred using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.

A common yet misled assumption is that the closest sites to a significant marker are the prime candidates as the causative mutation. However, LD blocks are typically fragmented and intermingled. We studied chicken LD of mapped QTLRs for Marek's Disease in numerous chicken populations. We estimated background LD by random sampling of non-syntenic or syntenic marker pairs from different or same chromosomes. We defined LD blocks as a group of markers located on the same chromosome having significant moderate (0.15[&ge;] r2 < 0.7) or high (r2 [&ge;] 0.7) LD, regardless of distance and the number of mixed markers with no LD. Next, we studied QTLR LD by all SNP markers within the QTLRs. We found very complex, nearly chaotic, LD patterns, with fragmented and interdigitated LD blocks. Exceptional LD was found between QTLRs 4-5. LD blocks and protein networks shared by the two QTLRs suggest possible functional relationships. Thus, potential causative candidates could be found beyond non-LD sites, occasionally at a very large distance from a significant marker, and even in another QTLR. Multiple effects might make LD intrinsically chaotic, thus limiting GWAS informativity and repeatability. Chaotic complexity challenges the practical use of LD across populations, and must be accounted for while interpreting genetic mapping studies.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

There is currently no treatment that effectively slows the disease progression, and the synthetic drugs proposed to alleviate the symptoms, often cause side effects. Many studies are now focused on neuroprotective properties exhibited by natural agents, such as polyphenols, whose action on different cell signaling pathways is well known. In this article, we analyzed the composition and the properties of polyphenolic extracts from forage plants, such as Lotus ornitopoidioides, Hedysarum coronarium L., Medicago sativa and Cichorium intybus. The LC-MS/MS analysis on the extracts allowed the identification of total 24 phenolic acids and 25 flavonoids. The effects of the extracts on key enzymes of cholinergic neurotransmission, such as acetyl cholinesterase and butyryl cholinesterase, was examined, together with an investigation on the aggregation and disaggregation of amyloid fibrils. The polyphenols acted as inhibitors of the considered enzymes, and interfered with the amyloidogenesis process, with differences depending on the specific extracts. The inhibition constants towards cholinesterases ranged in the 60 - 240 M interval; the extracts showed different inhibition mechanisms, from competitive to non-competitive. Differences also emerged in the amyloidogenesis process, with IC50 values comprised in a large interval. Finally, the extract from M. sativa significantly reduced the cell viability of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. These results suggest that polyphenols extracted from these plants may behave as multitargeting agents against key factors of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, they can be considered as promising candidates for the prevention and management of symptoms of these neurodegenerative disorders in combination with pharmacological therapies.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

In this work, we develop predictors for cleavage, elution, and binding affinity in the MHC Class I pathway, incorporating evidential deep learning to provide unified uncertainty estimates. We first perform supervised fine-tuning of a protein language model on human proteins, and then align the model through group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to reduce MHC Class I epitopes under a curriculum learning framework, in which the curriculum progressively increases the number of masked predicted epitopes and the number of alleles considered during training.

OpenSim currently lacks a tool to predict GRF&Ms directly from kinematics. This study presents OpenGRF, an OpenSim-based tool designed to estimate GRF&Ms and the centre of pressure (CoP) from joint kinematic data and validates its performance against force plate recordings. Methods The proposed methodology integrates calibrated foot-ground contact probes with an optimization framework based on computed muscle control, while CoP is computed accounting for both kinematic and dynamic contributions. For validation, a scaled FullBodyModel (37-DoF without muscles) was created for seven healthy adults performing six trials each of level walking, stair ascent, and stair descent, for a total of 126 marker-based trials. GRF&Ms predictions were compared to reference force plate data using normalized RMSE (nRMSE), Pearson correlation coefficients (p), CoP error, and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Results Results showed high accuracy for vertical GRF (nRMSE up to 1.5%, p higher than 0.94), particularly during level walking, and good accuracy for anterior-posterior GRF (nRMSE 4.4-6.1%, p = 0.81-0.91). Medio-lateral GRF was less reliable, especially in stair tasks (nRMSE up to 11.2%, p down to 0.48). Free moments were the most challenging quantity to predict across all tasks (nRMSE up to 28%). In contrast, ankle moments were predicted with high fidelity (nRMSE almost 1.7%, p almost 0.98). Median CoP errors were 21-23 mm, with largest discrepancies during double support. Conclusions OpenGRF enables physics-consistent estimation of GRF&Ms and CoP directly from kinematics, achieving the highest accuracy for vertical GRFs and predicting ankle moments that closely match those obtained from force plate measurements.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

The device, fabricated from flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) on a transparent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) substrate, enables direct organoid-endothelial interaction within a fibrin-Matrigel matrix without physical barriers. In this system, endothelial cells formed choroid-like networks that integrated with retinal organoids. Vascular network density and invasion into RPE regions were enhanced by VEGF stimulation, recapitulating features of wet AMD. Furthermore, fluorescent liposomes distributed along endothelial structures and accumulated at the organoid interface, supporting the application of this model for nanoparticle delivery studies.

However, most computational methods rely on three-dimensional structural models, which are often unavailable for many complexes. We introduce BindPred, a structure-agnostic input framework that predicts affinities directly from amino acid sequences by combining embeddings from large protein language models with gradient boosting trees. On the PPB-Affinity benchmark, which comprises 11,919 diverse complexes, BindPred achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 in random split five-fold cross-validation, where the training and test sets share <30% global sequence identity. Ablation analysis indicates that evolutionary embeddings alone capture most of the predictive signals, while augmenting with physics-based energy terms from PyRosetta and BindCraft increases the correlation by only 0.01. A more stringent protein-level split that places entire protein families (wild-type and all mutants) exclusively in either training or testing sets, results in only a modest decline in performance, demonstrating robust generalization to novel interaction pairs. Because BindPred operates exclusively on sequence input, it enables rapid inference (approximately 3 million complexes per GPU (T4) hour), making proteome-scale screening computationally feasible.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

To address this translational gap, we describe the largest known canine urothelial carcinoma organoid bioarchive, with in-depth phenotypical and molecular characterization. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of key biomarkers including UPKIII, E-cadherin, Vimentin, and Ki-67 in organoids. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed cellular heterogeneity, while bulk RNA sequencing showed canine patient-to-patient variability in transcriptomic profiling. Bulk RNA sequencing also displayed highly similar expression profiles between tissue- and urine-derived organoids, as well as similarity to previously published human MIBC transcriptome data. Whole genome sequencing in a subset of patients further supported the overall genomic fidelity of the organoids with their tissue of origin. Finally, for proof-of-concept of usefulness for drug testing studies, organoid cytotoxicity to vinblastine was investigated in several organoid lines. These canine bladder cancer organoid lines can be thawed, expanded, and screened for response to potential novel therapeutics to expand personalized medicine approaches.

Using a 54-marker CODEX panel, we profiled 2,033,725 cells in 55 tissue regions of interest and identified 41 cell types through unsupervised clustering and supervised annotation. During leukemic progression, we observed an expansion of myeloid and progenitor cell populations, increased PD-L1+ leukemic cells, the upregulation of PD-1 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and a profound loss of B cells, plasma cells and bone cells. Advanced CML exhibited a striking expansion of immature, pericyte-deficient vasculature that disrupted vascular niches and impaired hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell positioning. Spatial mapping revealed leukemia-specific cellular neighborhoods enriched in PD-1+CD8+ T cells, suggesting localized immune cell exhaustion. Early-stage CML showed increaseds between plasmacytoid dendritic cells and megakaryocytes, whereas advanced CML featured heightened megakaryocyte emperipolesis of non-leukemic granulocytes. Megakaryocytes were morphologically irregular in CML mice and BM trephine biopsies from CML patients. Laser-capture microdissected megakaryocytes from newly diagnosed CML patients had reduced expression of cytoskeleton genes, which was reversed in advanced cases treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 3D imaging revealed vascular disorganization and depleted megakaryocytes in the diaphysis, underscoring region-specific pathology.

These molecules likely contribute to the health benefits associated with spinach consumption. However, little is known about the genetic diversity of these molecules, their bioaccessibility, and the heritability of these traits. We assembled a diversity panel of 30 F1 and open pollinated spinach accessions and cultivated them under controlled conditions over two periods. Quantification of 39 flavonoids revealed that their concentration is largely influenced by environmental factors and at least two divergent branches in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway may exist. Despite generally similar trends in the amounts of major flavonoids, open pollinated and F1 varieties of spinach could be distinguished based on the concentrations of minor flavonoid species. Broad sense heritability estimates for absolute bioaccessibility accounted for more genetic variation than raw material content, suggesting that this trait is preferable for breeders seeking to alter the phytochemical profile of spinach. Lastly, we found that several spinach flavonoids are unstable under digestive conditions, made evident by the proportion of aglycones rising from 0.1% to approximately 15% of total flavonoids after digestion.

B.; Roy, S.", "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have emerged as key regulators of diverse physiological and metabolic processes in cells. Notably, many metabolic enzymes exhibit moonlighting RNA-binding functions, and a substantial fraction localize to chloroplasts, the primary hub of photosynthesis and cellular metabolic homeostasis. Since chloroplasts originated from free-living cyanobacteria, understanding the RBP repertoire in these ancient phototrophs holds particular evolutionary and functional significance. A comprehensive characterization of the cyanobacterial RBPome is still lacking. Here, we employed Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, a model cyanobacterium, to define its RBPome using an RNA-interactome capture approach. We identified 136 RBPs, of which nearly 30% are associated with metabolic pathways, a proportion notably higher than that observed in bacteria, algae, plants, flies, worms, or animals. Strikingly, several enzymes from core metabolic pathways, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the TCA cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway, that are known RNA binders in humans are also conserved as RBPs in cyanobacteria. We identified a wide array of proteins from the photosynthetic apparatus exhibiting RNA-binding activity, many of which are conserved across the green lineage. In silico structural alignments of RNA-binding metabolic enzymes with their NAD(P)-binding pockets, a potential site for RNA-binding, suggests a broad conservation of RNA-binding capacity of core metabolic enzymes across species. Recent discoveries have revealed that RNA-binding can modulate enzymatic activity. In this context, our findings suggest that RNA-mediated control of core cellular metabolic processes may be widespread in cyanobacteria and riboregulation might be an evolutionarily ancient mechanism, potentially tracing its origins back to cyanobacteria.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

In Arabidopsis thaliana, PLANT PEPTIDE CONTAINING SULFATED TYROSINE (PSY) peptides and their receptors (PSYRs) mediate growth-stress trade-offs, yet the transcriptional regulation of these genes remains poorly understood. Here, we mapped transcription factor (TF)-promoter interactions for nine PSY and three PSYR genes by combining high-throughput yeast one-hybrid screening with DAP-seq data, uncovering 1,207 interactions that reveal both shared and gene-specific regulatory relationships. Functional analysis of 25 TF mutants identified 12 regulators that significantly influence shoot and root growth, most acting as repressors. Of these, CYTOKININ RESPONSE FACTOR 10 (CRF10) emerged as a strong growth inhibitor. We found a CRF10 binding motif in the PSYR3 promoter using DAP-seq data and validated by eY1H. Guided by these insights, we applied CRISPR/Cas9-mediated promoter editing to precisely delete functional TF-binding sites. Removal of this motif, or its surrounding region, reduced PSYR3 expression and enhanced root growth, yielding variants that retained root length comparable to the crf10 mutant but displayed reduced susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. Together, our results define the global TF-promoter interaction network of the PSYR/PSY pathway and identify CRF10 as a key transcriptional regulator of PSYR3-mediated signaling.

It is characterized by progressive miniaturization of hair follicles and shortening of the anagen phase. The condition is widely attributed to genetic predisposition and androgen-mediated activation of androgen receptors. Other factors, such as the immune microenvironment, could also contribute to the pathogenesis; however, the specific mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the potential role of skin-resident myeloid cells in interacting with hair follicle cells under androgen stimulation, and to elucidate the sex-specific differences in dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced hair loss. Both female and male mice received DHT treatment, and histological examination was performed to assess DHT-induced alterations in skin morphology. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was utilized to profile skin cell populations and explore underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that DHT inhibited hair regrowth in both sexes, altered skin thickness, and induced hair follicle miniaturization. scRNA-seq analysis revealed enhanced interactions between myeloid and fibroblast subpopulations, with more robust crosstalk observed in female mice. In vitro experiment demonstrated that DHT promoted apoptosis of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in the presence of macrophages. Treatment with polypeptides Y001 and Y002 effectively promoted hair regrowth by suppressing apoptosis signaling pathways.

We introduce a dimensionless parameter, the effective selection strength, to characterize quantitative traits in both models. We show that adapting populations attain a stationary state below a critical speed of environmental change. Properties of the stationary state are compared between the two approaches, and it is shown that the adaptive walk model provides a good approximation for long-term polygenic adaptation. Additionally, in the adaptive walk model, we derive an explicit formula for the logarithmic divergence of the stationary phenotypic gap upon approaching the critical speed. To elucidate population extinction in biologically realistic terms, we define a fitness-threshold-based critical speed and reveal its power-law dependence on the effective selection strength in both models. Finally, results of our polygenic simulations show how the genetic architecture in the stationary regime is shaped by a dynamic equilibrium between the influx of de novo mutations and their loss through fixation and extinction constrained by the rate of phenotypic change enforced by the optimum speed.

However, existing OGM implementations neglect the recycling stage, where naive truncation selection dissipates the diversity initially safeguarded. Here, we propose an integrated strategy that couples optimal recycling with genomic mating to better control genetic diversity while delivering competitive genetic gains. Using stochastic simulations of line and hybrid breeding schemes, we show that the integrated strategy retained 1.6-2.0 times more diversity than OGM alone and 3.5-5.0 times more than truncation mating based on family means and the usefulness criterion (UC). These were equivalent to maintaining around 1.7 and 2.4 times less realized inbreeding rates. Additionally, it improved the efficiency of translating variance into gain by 21.6-49.8% and 67.4-108.2% compared to the sole implementation of OGM and truncation mating strategies. We also demonstrate the utility of our newly developed intuitive and standardized metric, proportion of additive standard deviation lost (PropSD), for managing diversity in the crossing and recycling stages. Pareto optimal solutions were achieved at around 2-3% and 4-5% PropSD without and with optimal recycling. Finally, we derive a closed-form expression quantifying the expected advantage of UC over mean-based mating. Modeling within-family variance offered limited additional benefit, mainly due to high family mean-to-standard-deviation variance ratios.

We introduce GARAGE, a Graph-Attentive RAre-cell aware single-cell data GEneration that augments the generator's input with a small, attention-weighted 'leakage' of real cells in addition to prior noise. Specifically, we build a k-nearest-neighbour cell graph and use a graph attention network (GAT) to prioritize nodes that likely represent under-sampled (rare) subpopulations; these high-attention cell embeddings are injected into the generator input to steer synthesis toward biologically plausible regions of the data manifold while respecting cell-type proportions. This attention-guided leakage accelerates training, reduces mode dropping, and yields realistic synthetic cells that preserve rare-cell structure. Across real scRNA-seq benchmarks, GARAGE improves downstream feature selection and clustering compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Activating mutations resulting in degradation-resistant forms of {beta}-catenin (CTNNB1) have been shown to be the main driver for many of these neoplasms. However, the underlying genetic driver for a proportion of these tumours is still unknown. Using murine transgenic models, we show that genetic disruption of the Wnt-antagonist and tumour suppressor, adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), within the pituitary progenitors/stem cells, leads to pituitary tumours that closely resemble human aCPs. These tumours present classic histopathological hallmarks of aCPs, such as large deposits of wet keratin, stellar-reticular-like cells, large cystic components and clusters of accumulating nucleo-cytoplasmic {beta}-catenin that are slow-dividing and exhibit a secretory phenotype. We show that a hypomorphic allele of Apc is sufficient for tumour development, indicating that disruption of Apc function can lead to aCP formation. Moreover, we identify that bi-allelic loss of Apc in the Sox2+ve pituitary stem cells is sufficient to initiate tumour formation, indicating that Sox2+ve stem cells are the cell origin of these Apc-driven aCPs. Transcriptomic analyses of early tumour-initiating cells revealed that Apc-driven clusters of accumulating {beta}-catenin undergo senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is p21-mediated and results in secretion of inflammasome, angiosome and developmental growth factors. Our data unequivocally show a causal role for the disruption of the tumour suppressor Apc as a primary driver of aCPs independent of mutations in {beta}-catenin. We provide murine models representing a novel genetic subtype of human aCPs, offering insights into aCP pathogenesis.

We focus on USP16, a nucleosome DUB with activity for Ub and Ub-like modifiers, and show that whilte its ZnF-UBP domain can bind substrates, it is also a crucial contributor to enzyme kinetics. Slow Ub release from the catalytic domain after cleavage causes product inhibition, which is overcome in cis by ZnF-UBP-mediated product release. Interestingly, supplying a high affinity product-capturing ZnF-UBP domain in trans, activates USP16 and other USP enzymes. Our data shows the importance of product inhibition as a regulatory mechanism in DUBs, and exemplifies the unappreciated role of exo-domains in regulating DUB function beyond substrate binding.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Although these processes occur at the individual-cell level, most chromatin structure data are derived from population-averaged assays, such as Hi-C, obscuring the heterogeneity of single-cell conformations. To address this limitation, we developed a polymer physics-based modelling framework, the Sequential Bayesian Inference Framework (sBIF), that deconvolutes bulk Hi-C data to reconstruct single-cell 3D chromatin conformations. To support a broader use of sBIF, we created ChromPolymerDB, a publicly accessible, high-resolution database of single-cell chromatin structures inferred by sBIF. The database contains ~10^8 reconstructed 5 kb-resolution single cell structures, spanning over 60,000 genomic loci across 50 human cell types and experimental conditions. ChromPolymerDB features an interactive web interface with tools for 3D structural analysis and multi-omics integration. Users can explore associations between chromatin conformation and gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and regulatory elements. The platform also supports comparative analyses to identify structural changes across cell types, developmental stages, or disease contexts.

The distribution of TEs within a population of genomes is studied over the long term to understand the mechanisms allowing TEs to persist despite their deleterious effects on genomes. Under this single restrictive assumption, the results show that the population of TEs can persist for a very long time within the genome population, when the genome population is highly diverse in terms of the distribution of TEs quantities. When there is no mechanism for silencing TEs, the proposed model of asexual reproduction either purges TEs or leads to co-extinction of genomes and TEs.

While therapeutics have been developed to exploit these pH changes to modulate activity across different physiological environments, current approaches for generating pH-dependent binders, such as combinatorial histidine scanning and display-based selections, are largely empirical and often labor-intensive. Here we describe two complementary principles and associated computational methods for designing pH-dependent binders: (i) introducing histidine residues adjacent to positively charged residues at binder-target interfaces to induce electrostatic repulsion and weaken binding at low pH, and (ii) introducing buried histidine-containing charged hydrogen-bonding networks in the binder core such that the protein is destabilized under acidic conditions. Using these methods, we designed binders that dissociate at acidic pH against ephrin type-A receptor 2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, interleukin-6, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and the interleukin-2 mimic Neo2. Fusions of the designs to pH-independent binders of lysosomal trafficking receptors function as catalytic degraders, inducing target degradation at substoichiometric levels. Our methods should be broadly useful for designing pH-sensitive protein therapeutics.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Experimental results show that antigen-loaded Apt-circRNAs enable targeted delivery to antigen-presenting cells (APCs), drive endogenous antigen expression, activate antigen-specific T cells, and elicit potent immune responses that mediate clearance of both early- and late-stage tumors in mouse models. In humanized models of colorectal cancer, the combination of Apt-circRNA and PD-1 blockade produced synergistic antitumor effects and significantly reshaped the tumor microenvironment. In a first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial, Apt-circRNA vaccine encoding KRAS G12D/G12V neoantigens exhibited a favorable safety profile and induced robust immune activation, T cell mobilization, and neoantigen-specific immune responses.

W.", "abstract": "Escherichia coli is a commonly used host for recombinant protein production. It is advantageous to direct many recombinant proteins, especially those that require disulphide bonding for function, such as antibody fragments, to the periplasm of E. coli. This requires N-terminal fusion of a signal peptide that directs the polypeptide chain through the relevant translocation apparatus. Signal peptides cannot be selected on the basis of recombinant gene sequence, so screening is required to select the optimal signal peptide for each product, typically using subcellular fractionation, a time-intensive process. Fusion of a fluorescent protein such as GFP to the C-terminal of recombinant proteins has previously been used to accelerate cytoplasmic protein production process development, but most GFP proteins are not active in the periplasm. Previous studies have developed GFP derivatives that fold rapidly (such as superfolder GFP, sfGFP) and have been reported to be periplasmically active. Here, we tested the applicability of sfGFP as a periplasmic screening tool using single-cell analysis and structured illumination microscopy. We discovered that sfGFP is very poorly tolerated in the periplasm, causing deleterious effects on E. coli physiology, manifesting as poor growth, cell death, and loss of recombinant protein productivity. A further reason for poor GFP functionality in the periplasm is errant disulphide bonding, so we tested a cysteine-free GFP, which cannot form disulphide bonds; results were similar to sfGFP. In conclusion, currently-available GFP variants are poor fusion partners for screening production and translocation of recombinant proteins to the E. coli periplasm due to their negative impact on physiology.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Despite the well-documented antimicrobial capabilities of graphene oxide, its application at lower concentrations to preserve the structural and biological compatibility of metal alloys remains inadequately explored. This research addresses this gap by optimizing GO coatings at lower concentrations to achieve a delicate balance between antimicrobial efficacy and material biocompatibility. We explore the synergistic combination of electrochemically deposited GO at various concentrations (50, 100, 250, and 500 ug/mL) with PEDOT:PSS on AA1050 aluminum alloy (Al_GO/P). This approach aims to create a robust coating that enhances corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and the antifouling properties of AA1050 Al, towards biofilm-forming organisms such as Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Current study identifies that concentrations, particularly 100 and 250 ug/mL of GO on AA1050 aluminum alloy exhibit potent biocidal activity, while preserving aforementioned material properties. Since Al is an infinitely recyclable, green material, this work offers a sustainable alternative to traditional antimicrobial surfaces.

P.; Heitman, J.", "abstract": "Aneuploidy causes genome plasticity and enables adaptive responses that confer drug resistance in eukaryotes ranging from fungal pathogens to human cancer cells. Aspergillus fumigatus is a soil-resident fungus and the most common cause of invasive fungal infections globally. Aspergillosis has an alarmingly high mortality rate due in part to treatment failure resulting from widespread antimicrobial resistance and an ability of the fungus to dynamically adapt to changing environmental and host conditions. Our understanding of these treatment failures is hindered by gaps in knowledge about how this organism adapts to resist antimicrobial stress. We find that exposure to FK506, an antifungal and immunosuppressive compound produced by Streptomyces, selects for whole-chromosome aneuploidy in this fungus. Growth without FK506 results in rapid aneuploid chromosome loss and reversion to the euploid, drug-susceptible state. These chromosome duplications also reduce susceptibility to clinically-used azole antifungals, underscoring the utility of aneuploidy as a dynamic stress adaptation strategy. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Chr7 disomy leads to induction of the normally-silent neosartoricin biosynthetic gene cluster in response to FK506 exposure, and we demonstrate that constitutive genetic induction of this cluster recapitulates in the euploid background the response to FK506 in the aneuploid state. We further show that this response is independent from the production of neosartoricin, suggesting a role for cross-pathway metabolic changes resulting from activation of this gene cluster or from the aneuploid state. This study represents a major advance in understanding how aneuploidy leads to transient adaptation and antimicrobial drug resistance in a global human fungal pathogen.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Retinoids have been reported to exhibit antiviral potentials against multiple viral infections. In the present study, Tretinoin (TR) or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was evaluated for its anti-CHIKV activity using in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models. TR was able to impede CHIKV infection efficiently in Vero and physiologically relevant muscle cells, C2C12, with drastic reduction in the viral RNA, proteins and progeny formation. The IC50 of TR against CHIKV was estimated to be 20.05 {micro}M and 19.71 {micro}M in Vero and C2C12 cells, respectively. In addition, the inhibition was effective during entry as well as in the early stages of post CHIKV-infection. Notably, TR showed remarkable virucidal activity. Next, global transcriptome profile demonstrated that the signaling by Retinoic acid pathway was highly upregulated after CHIKV infection and Retinoic acid receptors (RAR), specifically RAR-{beta} are the key mediators for the anti-CHIKV effect of TR. Further, the drug was also capable to modulate CHIKV-induced inflammatory responses by reducing the phosphorylated MAPKs, NF-{kappa}B and proinflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, TR protected C57BL/6 mice from CHIKV challenge by diminishing viral burden leading to reduced clinical scores and better survival. Similar observation was also noticed in the ex vivo model of CHIKV-infected hPBMC-derived monocyte-macrophage populations. In conclusion, this work demonstrated the repurposing potential of TR against CHIKV infection for the first time, encouraging its clinical validation towards future therapeutics.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Yet, how these phage-host interactions impact biofilm architecture and ecological dynamics remains poorly understood, particularly in situations where antagonistic strains coexist in structured communities. In the marine Roseobacteraceae Sulfitobacter pontiacus, two genetically similar heteroimmune prophages, (termed A and D) establish lysogeny in their host. Depending on the host plasmid genotype, prophages are fixed in either high or low induction states, which consequently shape both biofilm structure and competitive outcomes. Using confocal scanning laser microscopy of fluorescently labeled lysogens, we investigated how prophage induction and phage genotype of phage-host coalitions influence monoculture and co-culture (competitive) S. pontiacus biofilms grown at a fluid-solid interface. Compared to their low induction counterparts, high-induction strains formed thicker and more voluminous monoculture biofilms, which primarily result from vertical protrusions arising from a basal monolayer. In co-culture experiments, mixing strains with reciprocal prophage genotypes that can mutually kill each other through phage-mediated allelopathy, we observed unexpected coexistence and synergistic biofilm enhancement rather than competitive exclusion. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were significantly higher in co-cultures than monocultures and correlated with local cell density, suggesting that phage-mediated interactions generate hotspots of oxidative stress, which is expected to further promote prophage induction, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies cell lysis and release of matrix components. These results suggest temperate phages can paradoxically stabilize and promote biofilm growth via mechanisms that combine antagonistic killing with cooperative matrix production, revealing how phage-mediated interactions can shape microbial community architecture in spatially structured environments.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

Despite a decade of studies comparing ST313 to the classical diarrheal S. Typhimurium ST19 pathovariant, the molecular basis of the differences of pathogenesis between these bacteria remains unclear. Here we used primary human macrophages infected with the invasive S. Typhimurium ST313 D23580 isolate and the reference ST19 4/74 isolate as an in vitro model of infection. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that primary human macrophages infected with ST313 bacteria had distinct patterns of host cell death and inflammation responses compared to ST19-infected cells. Specifically, infection with ST313 isolate induced significantly less pyroptotic cell death which was associated with minimal processing of Gasdermin-D. We discovered that S. Typhimurium ST313 stimulated reduced IL-1{beta} release and a low-level activation of the upstream inflammasome signaling cascade with reduced Caspase-4 and Caspase-1 cleavage. To investigate the molecular basis of this phenotype we purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) species from ST313 to identify physical properties and structures that were distinct from ST19 LPS. The ST313-derived LPS was less pro-inflammatory than LPS from ST19, mirroring the low inflammatory phenotype of the live bacteria.

We identified FtsZ GTPase protein sequences across alphaproteobacterial genomes, from representative genera for each family, and observed numerous ftsZ duplications in the order Hyphomicrobiales. Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) supported the maintenance of two distinct lineages of FtsZ GTPase duplications among three families. The Nitrobacteraceae duplication, occurring in only the genus Bradyrhizobium, exhibits a different substitution pattern from that shared by the Phyllobacteraceae and Rhizobiaceae families. Within the Rhizobiaceae lineage, Agrobacterium tumefaciens contains three paralogs of FtsZ including the essential FtsZAT, and paralogs FtsZ1, and FtsZ3. In A. tumefaciens, we show that FtsZ1, but not FtsZ3, inhibits cell division when overexpressed. A hyperactive allele of ftsW partially protected against overexpression of ftsZ1 suggesting that FtsZ1 may inhibit proper regulation of septal peptidoglycan biosynthesis during cell division.

Findings remain inconsistent-some report shifts in specific taxa, whereas others observe little change in diversity. To date, no large-scale longitudinal study has examined oral microbiome development across all three trimesters, leaving the early gestational dynamics largely unexplored. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of the oral microbiome in 346 pregnant women from Israel and validated key findings in an independent cohort of 154 pregnant women from Russia. In Israel, Saliva samples were collected during the first (T1, 11-14 weeks), second (T2, 24-28 weeks), and third (T3, 32-38 weeks) trimesters; in Russia, samples were collected during the second and third trimesters at the same time points. Alongside sample collection, participants completed comprehensive dietary and health questionnaires to assess maternal factors that could influence microbial composition. Microbial profiles were analyzed to test for (i) differential abundance across trimesters, (ii) the influence of maternal nutrition and lifestyle factors. Results: Significant shifts in oral microbial composition were observed as early as the transition from T1 to T2. Alpha diversity decreased progressively from T1 (Shannon's diversity index: 3.261) to T2 (3.173) and T3 (3.109; Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.0023) in the Israeli cohort. Notable taxonomic changes included significant decreases in Verrucomicrobiota and Euryarchaeota from T1 to T2, with Akkermansia muciniphila showing a particular reduction. Conversely, Synergistota increased significantly during this transition. Gammaproteobacteria increased while Erysipelotrichia decreased between T1 and T2, suggesting an ecological shift from commensal, barrier-supporting taxa toward communities associated with dysbiosis and inflammation. Despite these systematic changes, individual microbial signatures- measured as pairwise distances between trimesters-remained relatively conserved across trimesters. Maternal factors that significantly modulated oral microbiome composition included adherence to gluten-free diets (the most robust association across all trimesters in Israeli women), smoking history, and conception method, with gluten-free diet showing consistent associations with taxa in the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families. Conclusions: This study provides the first large-scale evidence of significant oral microbiome changes beginning in early pregnancy, characterized by reduced diversity and a directional shift toward potentially pro-inflammatory communities. The strong associations with gluten consumption and smoking suggest that early pregnancy represents a critical window for microbiome modulation through dietary interventions. The alteration in the microbial composition highlights the oral microbiome as a sensitive marker of gestational physiology.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

The wing patterns of skippers often consist of median stripes, and classic comparative morphology studies suggest these elements are homologous to the Central Symmetry System (CSS) found in nymphalid butterflies. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show here that expression of the signaling ligand gene WntA, a marker of the CSS in nymphalids, prefigures the position of the main wing patterns of the silver-spotted skipper Epargyreus clarus. Notably, WntA expression is associated with different color outputs in the forewing vs. hindwing, validating a theory of pattern homology from the mid-twentieth century. To further gain insights into the genes associated with this patterning process, we generated an annotated genome for E. clarus and performed an RNAseq study profiling gene expression along the proximo-distal (P-D) axis of early pupal wings. These data suggest that the transcription factor genes lobe, u-shaped, and odd-paired are expressed in restricted P-D sections of the wing similarly to WntA, indicating they may participate in the patterning of the CSS.

Yet, thermal variation typically occurs in the presence of additional selection pressures which may interact to constrain adaptation to temperature. We propagated competing lytic viral parasites (bacteriophages {varphi}14-1 and {varphi}LUZ19) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under fluctuating temperatures (37-42{degrees}C) in monoculture and in co-culture. Without competition, fluctuating temperatures favoured intermediate thermal phenotypes in the phage {varphi}14-1 and resulted in more variable evolutionary outcomes compared to static conditions. However, co-selection from fluctuating temperatures and competition led to restricted thermal adaptation, slower evolutionary rates, and fewer putative adaptive mutations in the {varphi}LUZ19 competitor.

In binary complexes, the NediV IRES primarily occupies the ribosomal P site, exhibiting conformational flexibility and engaging the ribosome at multiple interaction sites. Upon translocation, the IRES undergoes structural rearrangements, including destabilization of its PKI domain, facilitating the transition to canonical elongation. Crucially, we captured an eEF2-bound complex, along with an eEF1A-bound post-proofreading complex featuring a mismatched tRNA, the latter representing the first instance of a canonical elongation complex visualized in the presence of a natural, hydrolysable nucleotide and without the addition of any trapping agents.

We used a crystallographic and computational approach to identify 31 fragments that bind heparanase; five of these inhibited heparanase in the micromolar range. One of these fragments underwent two cycles of fragment growing, which resulted in a compound with a seven-fold increased potency compared to the initial hit.

While the emergence of new variants of concern was associated with loss of protection from infection, protection from serious disease was maintained. What was less clear was whether this protection was associated with expansion, affinity maturation of pre-existing cross-reactive B cells, or de novo generation of variant-specific B cells. To define the cross-reactivity of memory B cell populations generated through infection and/or vaccination with pre-Omicron variant spike, we utilised archived samples from healthcare workers enrolled in the extensively monitored Panther study cohort. Using samples collected from Omicron-naive individuals approximately three months (106 days) after a third BNT162b2 vaccine dose, we analyzed the spike-specific B cell repertoire via multiparameter flow cytometry and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing. Reactivity to both Lineage A and Omicron spike proteins was higher for serum IgG than IgA, and serum neutralisation potency was significantly reduced against pseudoviruses bearing the Omicron spike compared to those with Lineage A spike. The frequency of Omicron-reactive IgA+ B cells was markedly lower than that of Lineage A-reactive cells, whereas Omicron-reactive IgG+ memory B cells were more frequent. These responses were predominantly localized to classical memory and double-negative (DN) B cell subsets. BCR sequencing of donors unexposed to Omicron confirmed that Omicron-binding clones were class-switched and somatically mutated, indicating they originated from pre-existing memory B cells primed by vaccination or infection. Our findings demonstrate that memory B cells generated through infection and/or immunisation with pre-Omicron variants were primed for broad antigenic recognition despite Omicron's extensive genetic divergence. However, the diminished IgA+ B cell frequency suggests a weakened mucosal antibody defence, potentially explaining the continued susceptibility to infection despite preserved protection from severe disease.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

K.; Arkin, A. P.", "abstract": "Bacteriophages (phages), the most abundant self-replicating entities on Earth, are central to microbial ecology and hold promise as therapies against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. However, the molecular determinants of phage adaptation to hosts remain poorly defined. While bulk genetic screens such as transposon sequencing are high throughput, running all mutants in mixed populations biases outcomes toward phage receptor discovery. Competition among resistant mutants and the escalating multiplicity of infection (MOI) from additional phages released from lysed cells often mask moderately acting host factors-such as inner-membrane and energy-transduction systems supporting DNA entry, surface modifiers, and regulators of host defense. To overcome these limitations, we developed droplet-based random barcode transposon-site sequencing (Droplet RB-TnSeq), which encapsulates single barcoded mutant cells with defined phage titers. Applying this method to Escherichia coli infected with phages T4 and N4, we reproducibly recovered known determinants (ompC for T4 and nfrA/B for N4) and identified additional contributors, including membrane proteins, polysaccharide modifiers, signaling modules, and several uncharacterized genes. Notably, mutations in chbR/C/F, ygaZ/H, and yfbO/L were found to confer resistance to N4, validated by plaque assays and complementation. Droplet RB-TnSeq thus enables genome-wide dissection of host factors beyond receptor-level interactions under well-controlled infection conditions.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

What has not been assessed to date however are possible adverse effects of the API-ILs considering the potentially wide-scale application and the inevitable release to the environment, as is the case with antibiotics and other popular medications. In this study, API-ILs based on the antibiotic ciprofloxacin were synthesized and investigated in terms of their antimicrobial activity and influence on mutation frequency of Escherichia coli MG1655. This is the first report that by formulating of antibiotics as API-ILs, bacterial mutation frequencies can be significantly increased, while structurally similar chloride ILs alone do not have such an effect. The observed changes in mutation frequencies seem to be dependent on the structure of the respective counterion. As increased mutation frequencies can fuel adaptation and ultimately resistance development of bacteria, it is crucial to improve our understanding of how API-ILs can designed in a safer way.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

We conducted viability assays on C. elegans to evaluate how these isolates affect nematode survival. The selected bacterial strains, rooted in historical foodborne outbreak significance but environmentally isolated, were previously sequenced to provide a comprehensive genomic framework. A notable focus of our research was on the nearly genetically identical PFGE types Newport-61 and the Newport-1015 isolates, which differ by a ~1.7 Mb genomic inversion. C. elegans survival assays in response to pathogenic-strain infections revealed that one Newport-1015 and the Newport-61 were particularly more virulent compared to other strains tested.

PspA-deficient strains of two different genetic backgrounds displayed increased sensitivity, while recombinant PspA neutralized peptide activity and anti-PspA antibodies enhanced bacterial killing. The capsule conferred serotype-dependent protection, with type 2 being more effective than type 4, and free polysaccharides acted as decoys by sequestering HNP-1. Removal of surface PspA from capsule-deficient mutants revealed additive contributions of both factors to survival.

Here, we report the de novo design and directed evolution of helical bundle protein catalysts for enantioselective germylation through Ge-H insertion, a transformation not previously achieved by enzymatic catalysis. Comparative computational analysis revealed that, rela-tive to Si-H insertion, the Ge-H insertion reaction proceeds through an earlier and more flexible transition state, introducing distinct challenges for stereocontrol. Using a fully de novo designed truncated four-helix bundle scaffold as the starting point, directed evolution afforded a quadruple mutant that catalyzes Ge-H insertion with high efficiency, enantioselectivity, and broad substrate scope. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that beneficial mutations introduced from directed evolution enhanced active-site preorganization and modulated local backbone flexibility, contributing to improved transition-state complementarity with fine-tuned binding pocket size and more stable cofactor positioning regulated by hydrogen bonding interactions.

Our data show how irreversible pre-ribosomal RNA degradation by the redundantly tethered RNA exosome couples the transformation of the SSU processome into a pre-40S particle during which Utp14 can probe evolving surfaces, ultimately positioning and activating Dhr1 to unwind the U3 snoRNA and initiate nucleolar pre-40S release.

U.", "abstract": "Due to complexity of microbial communities and coarseness of currently available manipulation techniques (e.g. transplantation, antibiotic-treatment), it is often difficult to fully elucidate the interactions between members that define community structure and function from the top-down. Thus, it is imperative to be able to observe and manipulate subpopulations within microbial communities to enable a fine-detail understanding of the full-spectrum and mechanism of community functions. However, there is a technological gap that prevents targeted manipulation of subpopulations within intact microbial mixtures and communities. In this work, we develop molecular probes to manipulate specific subpopulations within multispecies microbial populations and validate these methods using model synthetic populations in vitro. We leverage the narrow-spectrum of class II peptide bacteriocin (a bacterially-synthesized antimicrobial peptide), pediocin PA-1, as a model to develop molecular probes. We first demonstrate the narrow-spectrum activity of pediocin and quantify its potency against a panel of bacteria. Next, we conjugate chemical handles on the bacteriocin and show that the binding spectrum is largely unchanged. Finally, using truncated variants, also conjugated to chemical handles, we show functional non-bactericidal binders that largely maintain their specificity. Finally, with the unmodified and modified bacteriocins, we show that specific bacteria can be depleted through killing or cell sorting within a mixture of highly similar bacteria. While we developed the system with a single bacteriocin, we expect that the elucidated design rules may be applicable to a variety of natural bacteriocins to develop a generalized approach for manipulating specific bacterial members within a community. Development of such molecular probes would be transformative to advancing mechanistic underpinnings of microbial community and microbiota structure-function relationships.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

The T3SS is an important virulence factor linked to increased morbidity and mortality in infections, yet its expression slows bacterial growth and activates innate immune receptors. T3SS genes are expressed heterogeneously, with T3SS-ON cells arising from  primed bacteria that express the T3SS transcriptional activator ExsA and respond immediately to T3SS activating signals. However, the mechanistic basis for priming is not known. ExsA is part of a complex protein-sequestration network, positively regulating its own expression as well as that of its anti-activator (ExsD), its anti-anti-activator (ExsC) and ExsCs binding partner (ExsE). These four proteins create a bistable regulatory network. We hypothesized that transcription from a cAMP-dependent promoter upstream of ExsA could drive cells into the primed state and tested this at the single cell level. Exogenous cAMP increased the proportion of primed, ExsA-expressing cells, with whole cell cryo-electron tomography demonstrating assembly of T3SS injectisomes under these conditions. Intrastrain variation in endogenous cAMP levels correlated with strain-specific proportions of primed bacteria, while genetic manipulation of adenylate cyclases and cAMP phosphodiesterase altered primed population size. Priming occurred in planktonically cultured populations and was independent of type IV pilus assembly or retraction; however, mutation of genes in the Pil-Chp system, which regulates cAMP production, changed proportions of primed cells. This work demonstrates how endogenous and exogenous cAMP inputs into a bistable regulatory switch generate subpopulations of T3SS-primed cells poised to respond to activating signals.", "date": "2025-09-29", "journal": ""}

We sampled 16 sinks from two buildings (four floors each, with sinks closest and furthest to the bathroom entrance), which are cleaned daily with quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) disinfectants, during periods of low and high student traffic (during and after academic breaks, respectively) across winter, spring, and summer. We observed significant spatial and temporal variations in microbial assemblages. Individual sinks accounted for 43% (PERMANOVA, p < 0.0001) of the variation in microbial communities. Microbiomes in each building were dominated by two genera, which together accounted for 30% of the community composition: Acinetobacter and Enhydrobacter (also classified as Moraxella) in the newer building, and Sphingomonas and Mycobacterium in the older building. Acinetobacter abundance varied seasonally and showed higher relative abundance during periods of high traffic. Metagenomic analysis of selected sinks revealed a high prevalence of qac genes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) harboring antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) including A. parvus.

Entry assays using pseudoviruses expressing the spike proteins (S) of SARS-CoV-2, BANAL-236, and BANAL-52 revealed that efficient S-mediated entry depends on the expression of human ACE2 (hACE2) and human TMPRSS2 (hTMPRSS2) in human and Rhinolophus cells. Expression of Rhinolophus entry factors, either alone or in combination, did not facilitate SARS-CoV-2 or BANAL-236 entry in human cells, suggesting that the S protein of BANAL-236 interacts more efficiently with hACE2 than with its Rhinolophus counterpart (rACE2). Through biochemical, virological, and electron microscopy analyses, we showed that BANAL-236 and SARS-CoV-2 completed their replication cycles in a Rhinolophus cell line engineered to express high levels of hACE2 and hTMPRSS2. Despite efficient viral replication in modified Rhinolophus and human cells, no induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes was detected. Using a screening approach, we identified several BANAL-236 proteins that antagonize IFN production and signaling in human cells. Our findings thus show that BANAL-236 possesses critical features that enabled zoonotic spillover: hACE2 usage and potent evasion of human IFN responses.
