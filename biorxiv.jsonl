However, the associated changes in the geometry of the object manifolds along the cortex remain unknown. Using home cage training, we showed that mice are capable of invariant object recognition. We recorded the responses of thousands of neurons to measure the information about object identity across the visual cortex and found that the lateral areas LM, LI, and AL carry more linearly decodable object information compared to other visual areas. We applied the theory of linear separability of manifolds and found that the increase in classification capacity is associated with a decrease in the dimension and radius of the object manifold, identifying the key features in the geometry of the population neural code that are associated with invariant object coding.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

A separate cohort underwent acute toxicology (650-5000 mg/kg) with behavioural-observation and rotarod. Alkaloids were quantified by LC-MS/MS. {Delta}FosB-immunoreactive nuclei were counted in NAc 24h after the CPP post-test.Results: Alkaloids levels were within traditional ranges. High-dose ayahuasca(5000 mg/kg) produced transient-serotonergic-syndrome-like signs and rotarod locomotor-deficit; lower doses did not express toxicity. Ethanol produced a moderate-CPP in controls({Delta}Time{approx}+60s), whereas ayahuasca-pretreatment abolished preference at all doses({Delta}Time within{+/-}7s). One-way ANOVA on {Delta}Time showed a robust-Treatment effect(F(3,36)=8.83, p=0.00016); Tukey tests: control differed from each ayahuasca group (all p<0.05), with no differences among ayahuasca doses. {Delta}FosB density did not differ among groups(p>0.05).Conclusions: Ayahuasca was well tolerated at ceremonies-equivalent doses and blocked ethanol-induced-CPP across all doses, while {Delta}FosB levels in NAc were unchanged at 24h. Limitations on the CPP baseline and {Delta}FosB results may limit sensitivity, generalizability and interpretation.Findings provide preliminary evidence that ayahuasca-pretreatment may blunt ethanol-context preference, reinforcing the need of replication with stronger reward baselines, naive controls and complementary molecular markers.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Understanding the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) profile offers important insight into how humans regulate mechanical work during walking. Although the characteristic double-hump vGRF pattern is well documented, the mechanical factors underlying asymmetry in peak amplitudes and midstance trough timing remain unclear. Using a simple powered walking model and an inverted pendulum simulation with constant hip torque, we examined how step-transition work, collision and push-off, shapes the vGRF trajectory. We further compared these predictions to empirical data spanning walking speeds from 0.8 to1.4 m.s^(-1). The simple walking model predicted symmetric vGRF profiles across speeds because collision and push-off impulses were equal, resulting in passive single-support motion. In contrast, adding hip torque within the pendular model produced stance-phase asymmetries, shifting the vGRF trough earlier when torque added energy and later when torque dissipated energy. Empirical analysis revealed that collision and push-off impulses were generally unequal except at one speed, producing asymmetric vGRF peaks. At low speeds, push-off exceeded collision; at high speeds, the reverse occurred, consistent with a need for compensatory single-support positive work. These mechanical imbalances predicted systematic shifts in trough timing toward the dominant impulse. Therefore, we propose the Vertical GRF Trough Timing Index (vGRF-TTI), combined with collision and push-off peak amplitudes, as a clinically meaningful outcome capturing the balance of step-transition work. Earlier troughs with elevated collision peaks indicate impaired push-off or constrained gait conditions, whereas later troughs with larger push-off peaks reflect compensatory or enhanced propulsion. These metrics provide sensitive, mechanism-based indicators of gait efficiency and neuromotor control.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Recently, we developed a technique for tracking rapid (framewise) fluctuations in network connectivity over time. Here, we show that these \"edge time series\" are mathematically equivalent to interaction terms in a specific family of general linear models.

Interaction of S. aureus with versatile host cell receptors was described previously, suggesting that internalization of the pathogen can occur via several pathways. It remains elusive whether the pathway of internalization can affect the intracellular fate of the bacteria. Here, we identified a mechanism governing cellular uptake of S. aureus which relies on lysosomal Ca2+, lysosomal exocytosis and occurs concurrently to other well-known entry pathways within the same host cell population. This internalization pathway is rapid and active within only few minutes after bacterial contact with host cells. Compared to slow bacterial internalization, the rapid pathway demonstrates altered phagosomal maturation as well as translocation of the pathogen to the host cytosol and ultimately results in different rates of intracellular bacterial replication and host cell death.

Here, we report generation and liver characterization of a new humanized transgenic mouse model for AATD with a background of a CRISPR-Cas9 generated SERPINA1-null mouse.

While the first role can be achieved through unstructured connections tuned for homeostatic rate stabilization, computational tasks often require structured excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) connectivity. Here, we consider a broad class of pairwise inhibitory spike-timing dependent plasticity (iSTDP) rules, demonstrating how inhibitory synapses can self-organize to both stabilize excitation and generate functionally relevant connectivity structures---a process we call \"structured stabilization\". We show that in both E/I circuit motifs and large spiking recurrent neural networks the choice of iSTDP rule can lead to either mutually connected E/I pairs, or to lateral inhibition, where an inhibitory neuron connects to an excitatory neuron that does not directly connect back to it. In a one-dimensional ring network with two inhibitory subpopulations following these distinct iSTDP rules, the effective connectivity among the excitatory units self-organizes into a Mexican-hat-like profile, with excitatory influence in the center and inhibitory influence away from the center. This leads to emergent dynamical properties such as contextual modulation effects and modular spontaneous activity. Our theoretical work introduces a family of rules that retains the broad applicability and simplicity of spike-timing-based plasticity, while promoting structured, self-organized stabilization. These findings highlight the rich interplay between iSTDP rules, circuit structure, and neuronal dynamics, offering a framework for understanding how inhibitory plasticity shapes network function.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the function of E2F5 during mammary gland development using a mammary epithelial-specific conditional knockout model. We found that E2F5 expression and chromatin binding increase during early pregnancy, coinciding with the critical window of alveolar development. Loss of E2F5 resulted in delayed alveolar expansion during early pregnancy, characterized by reduced side branching and smaller alveolar structures during early pregnancy. Mechanistically, E2F5 deletion led to reduced expression of canonical E2F target genes involved in cell cycle progression. Surprisingly, E2F5 loss also caused enrichment of luminal progenitor populations at the expense of differentiated alveolar cells, with chromatin profiling revealing substantial depletion of the repressive H3K27me3 mark at luminal progenitor-associated genes. These findings suggest that E2F5 promotes differentiation of luminal progenitors into proliferative alveolar precursors during early pregnancy. We propose that E2F5 coordinates both proliferation and differentiation by driving progenitor cells to differentiate into mature luminal cells. The dual function of E2F5 in mammary development distinguishes it from classical cell cycle regulators and positions it as a critical coordinator of the developmental transitions required for lactation.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

However, tobacco smoke also likely alters the somatic selective pressures that drive lung cancer evolution, and these altered pressures have never been quantified nor compared to the oncogenic effects of tobacco-induced mutagenesis. This comparison is necessary for prediction of targeted therapy efficacy given exposure history. Here, we estimated background mutation rates, somatic selection, and selective epistasis for 21 driver genes in ever- and never-smoker lung adenocarcinoma (ES- and NS-LUAD). As expected, mutation rates were gene-specifically elevated in ES-LUAD. However, variant prevalence differences between ES- and NS- LUAD could not be explained by differential mutagenesis. KRAS, KEAP1, and STK11 mutations were more strongly selected in ES-LUAD. EGFR, PIK3CA, and SMAD4 mutations were more strongly selected in NS-LUAD, wherein EGFR mutations were associated with upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition--a functional consequence specific to exposure history. Epistasis was pervasive and context-dependent: ES-LUAD exhibited more synergy and less antagonism, implying a broader, more navigable adaptive landscape than NS-LUAD. We also performed the first systematic quantification of higher-order-than-pairwise epistasis, revealing sub-additive and emergent synergies that shape cancer evolution.

In the cortex, while peaking in the ACC, activity associated with time on task was extensive, also including activity decrements outside the default mode network, primarily involving motor and somatosensory regions. Information about reward levels was carried in the ventral striatum, consistent with its motivational role, but did not reflect trade-offs with increasing efforts during time on task. Instead, the ventral tegmental area and parts of the basal forebrain (BF) corresponding to the cholinergic Ch4 nuclei increased in activity with time on task and were sensitive to reward levels.

Each bat must avoid collisions with walls and conspecifics while locating the exit, all amidst overlapping acoustic signals. This crowded environment creates the risk of acoustic jamming, in which the calls of neighboring bats interfere with echo detection, potentially obscuring vital information. Despite these challenges, bats navigate these conditions with remarkable success. Although bats have access to multiple sensory cues, here we focused on whether echolocation alone could provide sufficient information for orientation under such high-interference conditions. To explore whether and how they manage this challenge, we developed a sensorimotor model that mimics the bats echolocation behavior under high-density conditions. Our model suggests that the problem of acoustic jamming may be less severe than previously assumed. Frequent calls with short inter-pulse intervals (IPI) increase the sensory input flow, allowing integration of echoic information across multiple calls. When combined with simple movement-guidance strategies, such as following walls and avoiding nearby obstacles, this accumulated information enables effective navigation in dense acoustic environments. Together, these findings demonstrate a plausible mechanism by which bats may overcome acoustic interference and underscore the role of signal redundancy in supporting robust echolocation-based navigation. Beyond advancing our understanding of bat behavior, they also offer valuable insights for swarm robotics and collective movement in complex environments.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

We calibrated single- and multi-host mechanistic transmission models to five types of wildlife surveillance and research data, describing molecular and serological evidence of USUV in birds. Although Eurasian blackbirds, the primary target species for surveillance, were most severely affected, our models indicated that USUV could not persist in blackbirds alone. Our framework provided statistical support for additional, unobserved bird species to have contributed to transmission. This population of bird species is characterised by limited infection mortality, a longer lifespan, and likely further dispersal than blackbirds.

To isolate the role of temperature, lab-based studies are increasingly used to assess and forecast disease risk under current and future climate conditions. However, in the field, the effects of temperature on parasitism may be mediated by other sources of variation, including local adaptation of hosts and parasites to one another and to the environment. To address the key knowledge gaps of how temperature influences host - parasite interactions and whether thermal responses measured in controlled experiments capture infection across temperature gradients in nature, we paired an extensive field survey of parasitism--by the ciliate Lambornella clarki on its tree hole mosquito host, Aedes sierrensis--with laboratory experiments describing parasitism thermal performance curves (TPCs) for six host populations from varying climates. We also investigated the mechanisms underlying the thermal biology of the host - parasite interaction by separately measuring TPCs for infection, host immunity, and parasite growth rates. Along the west coast of North America, across an 1100 km climate gradient spanning 12C mean rainy season temperature variation, we found that parasitism peaked at intermediately cold temperatures of 9.2 - 10C, and was consistent both between field seasons and with the lab experiment results. In the laboratory experiments, infection thermal responses were consistently nonlinear and peaked at 8.4 - 10C, showing no evidence of host intraspecific variation in temperature sensitivity to parasitism. Importantly, parasitism peaked at temperatures below the thermal optimum for free-living L. clarki due to the balance of temperature effects on parasite growth and reproduction against the strength of the host melanization immune response. The results suggest that nonlinear responses to temperature drive parasitism in nature, and that simple lab and field studies can accurately capture the thermal biology of multilayered host - parasite interactions.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

The magnitude of this tagging-related theta response predicted the coupling of slow oscillations to sleep spindles during post-learning sleep (an established neural correlate of sleep-dependent memory processing).

Specifically, a Cholesteric Liquid Crystal (CLC) model was proposed in which DNA is organized into parallel fibers within stacked discs, such that the fiber orientation rotates by a constant angle between adjacent discs. Extrachromosomal loops extending from the discs were hypothesized to be more accessible and thus to contain transcriptionally active genes. Although the CLC model captures some features of dinoflagellate chromosome structure, its validity has not been rigorously tested against modern genomic data. Here, we use chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data to simulate 3D conformations of chromosome scaffolds for three dinoflagellate species: Fugacium kawagutii, Symbiodinium microadriaticum, and Breviolum minutum. Consensus and population-based modeling generate diverse polymer conformations with moderate orientational and nematic order. However, we find no evidence of cholesteric discs. Moreover, contact probability curves from empirical Hi-C data are inconsistent with the CLC model. Nevertheless, we show that introducing locus-specific boundaries into the CLC model can produce simulated Hi-C contact maps with topologically associating domains (TADs), which are observed in experimental Hi-C contact maps for these species. Finally, by mapping RNA-seq data onto our simulated conformations, we show that actively transcribed genes are present throughout entire chromosomes, and not exclusively on extrachromosomal loops or at the surface. Our results challenge the long-standing CLC model and suggest that dinoflagellate chromosomes are organized into condensed but non-crystalline structures that do not impede transcription.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

While oligogalacturonides from homogalacturonan are well-studied DAMPs, the immune-signaling potential of other cell wall components remains largely unexplored. Conventional genetic and biochemical approaches aimed at identifying ligand-receptor pairs in plant immunity have been limited by the vast diversity of potential ligand molecules and functional redundancy of putative receptors. Here, we developed a high-throughput screening pipeline that simultaneously examines multiple interactions between plant cell wall-derived glycans and >350 extracellular domains (ECDs) of receptor kinases and receptor like proteins in Arabidopsis, resulting in the screening of >40,000 interactions. We discovered a group of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases named ARMs (AWARENESS of RG-I MAINTENANCES) that interact with rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I), a major component of pectin. RG-I treatment induced pattern-triggered immunity responses, with distinct kinetics compared to oligogalacturonide responses. We identified RG-I oligosaccharide structures required for interaction with ARM receptors and immune activation, and found that ARM receptors are redundantly involved in plant immunity. Collectively, our approach provides a powerful platform for discovering glycan-receptor pairs in plants, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of cell wall surveillance mechanisms in plant immunity.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Prior studies also suggest that biochar may have specific developmental effects on legumes, including increased root nodulation and altered morphology. We examined the growth and morphometric responses of legume and non-legume tropical trees to biochar additions in a common garden pot trial experiment. Four legume species (Acacia auriculiformis, A. mangium, Delonix regia, and Pterocarpus santalinus) and four non-legumes (Eucalyptus alba, Melia azedarach, Swietenia macrophylla, and Syzygium cumini) were compared in terms of sapling responses to additions of a wood-feedstock biochar applied at 10 and 20 t/ha. Overall, strong positive effects of biochar additions on sapling performance were observed, with an average increase of 30% in total biomass and a notable increase in height relative to diameter growth. Species showed pronounced differences in responses, with strong interactive effects of species and biochar treatments on growth metrics. Legume species showed an average increase somewhat greater than non-legumes; however, responses were variable among species, with the two Acacia species showing the largest responses, resulting in a non-significant pattern. A literature-based meta-analysis of tropical and subtropical trees likewise suggests greater biochar responses in legumes, but the analysis also falls short of statistical significance. In addition, experimental results indicate large interactive effects of species and biochar on soil pH and other soil properties. Large growth responses of certain taxa of legumes (and other taxa) to biochar, and pronounced species-specific effects on soil properties, may reflect evolved responses to fire disturbance that can be leveraged in the context of forest restoration and enhanced carbon sequestration in degraded tropical landscapes.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

As chromatin architecture is organized at the level of the nucleosome and regulated by histone post-translational modifications, we investigated how these known regulatory mechanisms influence nucleosome phase behavior. By systematically altering charge distribution within the H3 tail, we found that the terminal and central regions modulate the phase boundary and tune nucleosome condensate viscosity differentially, as revealed by microscopy-based assays, microrheology, and simulations. Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments revealed that H3 tails remain dynamically mobile within condensates, and their mobility correlates with condensate viscosity. These results demonstrate that the number, identity, and spatial arrangement of basic residues in the H3 tail critically regulate nucleosome phase separation. Our findings support a model in which nucleosomes, through their intrinsic properties and modifications, actively shape the local chromatin microenvironment--providing new insight into the histone language in chromatin condensates.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

In the present study, to investigate the roles of low- and high-level statistical image features in natural scene and object recognition, we conducted categorization tasks using a wide variety of natural scene (250) and object (200) images, along with two types of synthesized images: Portilla-Simoncelli (PS) synthesized images, which preserve low-level statistical features, and style-synthesized (SS) images, which retain higher-level statistical features. Behavioral experiments revealed that observers could categorize style-synthesized versions of natural scene and object images with high accuracy. Furthermore, we recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for the original, SS, and PS images and decoded natural scene and object categories using a support vector machine (SVM). Consistent with the behavioral results, natural scene categories were decoded with high accuracy within 200 ms after the stimulus onset. In contrast, object categories were successfully decoded only from VEPs for original images at later latencies. Finally, we examined whether style features could classify natural scene and object categories. The classification accuracy for natural scene categories showed a similar trend to the behavioral data, whereas that for object categories did not align with the behavioral results. Taken together, these findings suggest that although natural scene and object categories can be recognized relatively easily even when layout information is disrupted, the extent to which statistical features contribute to categorization differs between natural scenes and objects.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Background: Geomorphologically complex landscapes constrain animal movement and, therefore, the spatial spread of host-associated pathogens. Monitoring animal movement in such landscapes is required to understand these processes but remains challenging because structural barriers to animal movement (forests, mountains) also disrupt the visibility and signal quality of satellites used by animal-borne Global Positioning System (GPS) tags. In Latin America, rabies transmitted by vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) epitomises this challenge: viral spread is strongly constrained by mountains and may be exacerbated by bat dispersal responses to human disturbance. Methods: We used GPS tags to track the post-disturbance (i.e., capture, handling and tagging) movement of 93 vampire bats from five roosts in the highly complex landscape of inter-Andean valleys in Peru, where signal degradation reduced usable data by 89%. To overcome this data sparsity, the information gap needed to be filled by modelling and data imputation. Therefore, we developed a probabilistic Bayesian state-space model to infer the movement dynamics of vampire bats and to identify correlates of departure time and distance from the roost, with a focus on disturbance effects. Results: Immediately following the disturbance of capture, 43% of bats, particularly males and stronger flyers, disappeared from their roosts for the remainder of the study period, suggesting an acute disturbance response. For the 55 remaining GPS-tagged vampire bats, we observed longer flight distances and high individual heterogeneity on the night of disturbance, with bats gradually remaining closer to the roost over the 9-day study period. Conclusions: Roost abandonment and expanded foraging areas are expected to exacerbate rabies spread, demonstrating how human disturbances that alter animal movement may have unintended consequences for disease transmission. More generally, our Bayesian model accounting for GPS uncertainty and missing data extends the utility of animal-borne tracking to species living in complex landscapes with poor satellite visibility.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

This increase was observed consistently in experiment targeting the same TF in different cell lines. The surrounding of binding sites of certain TFs like MYC display a directional alteration of dinucleotide frequencies.

However, little is known about differences in sleep architecture by APOE genotype. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined the association between APOE genotype and sleep architecture among middle-aged and older adults, using polysomnography (Sleep Heart Health Study, N=3,132). APOE genotype included: APOE4 heterozygotes, APOE4 homozygotes, APOE2 carriers, and APOE3 homozygotes. Macro sleep architecture was quantified using the percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep (%REM), N1 (N1%), N2 (%N2), N3 (%N3), and arousal index. Micro sleep architecture was quantified as odds ratio product (ORP; a continuous measure of sleep depth) for overall sleep and each sleep stage, and spindle characteristics (power, density, and frequency). Linear regression was used, adjusting for covariates. Results: The mean age was 67, 53 percent were female, 24% were APOE4 heterozygotes, 2% were APOE4 homozygotes, 14% were APOE2 carriers, and 60% were APOE3 homozygotes. Macro sleep architecture did not vary across genotypes. Compared with APOE3 homozygotes, APOE4 homozygotes exhibited fewer arousals with age ({beta}=-0.33 per hour/year, p=0.04), resulting in significantly fewer arousals at age 70+. ORP decreased in a dose-response pattern with the number of APOE4 alleles during overall sleep and across all sleep stages (ORPAPOE3/3=0.94, ORPAPOE3/4=0.91, ORPAPOE4/4=0.87), and these group difference widened with each year of age. Finally, there was a trend for lower spindle density and power in APOE4 homozygotes relative to APOE3 homozygotes (ps=0.06). Conclusions: Arousal threshold increased in a dose-response manner with each APOE4 allele, as evidenced by the findings on ORP. The differences in ORP between APOE3 homozygotes and APOE4 carriers widened further with age, paralleling age-related declines in arousal index among APOE4 homozygotes. Despite these indications of elevated arousal thresholds that might suggest less sleep fragmentation in APOE4 carriers, APOE4 homozygotes exhibited poorer sleep micro architecture, including trends toward reduced sleep spindle activity. Taken together, reduced arousability in APOE4 carriers may reflect abnormalities in cortical activation that blunt arousal rather than an indicator of healthier sleep.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Many bacteria scavenge trace metals with metallophores, small molecules that chelate environmental metal ions. Metallophore production may be predicted by genome mining, where genomes are scanned for homologs of known biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, accurately detecting non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) metallophore biosynthesis requires expert manual inspection, stymieing large-scale investigations. Here, we introduce automated identification of NRP metallophore BGCs through a comprehensive algorithm, implemented in antiSMASH, that detects chelator biosynthesis genes with 97% precision and 78% recall against manual curation. We showcase the utility of the detection algorithm by experimentally characterizing metallophores from several taxa. High-throughput NRP metallophore BGC detection enabled metallophore detection across 69,929 genomes spanning the bacterial kingdom. We predict that 25% of all bacterial non-ribosomal peptide synthetases encode metallophore production and that significant chemical diversity remains undiscovered. A reconstructed evolutionary history of NRP metallophores supports that some chelating groups may predate the Great Oxygenation Event.

ACTs consist of an artemisinin and a longer-lived partner drug, which is often a quinoline. Given that heme is central to the mechanism of action of artemisinins and some quinolines, we hypothesized that these antimalarials would exhibit strong drug-drug interactions. Previous studies using standard 48 h or 72 h assays identified additive to mildly antagonistic interactions between artemisinins and quinolines. Here, we sought to re-evaluate these interactions using a pulsing assay that better mimics the short in vivo half-life of artemisinins. We found that chloroquine (CQ), piperaquine (PPQ), and amodiaquine substantially antagonize dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the active metabolite of artemisinins. CQ-DHA antagonism was notably exacerbated in CQ-resistant parasites, resulting in a superantagonistic phenotype in isobolograms. Further, we found that CQ co-treatment conferred artemisinin resistance to Kelch 13 wild type parasites in the ring stage survival assay. Using a small molecule probe to measure chemically reactive heme in live parasites, we determined that quinolines block artemisinin activation by rendering cytosolic heme inert. Finally, we probed beyond traditional ACTs, evaluating interactions of the proposed triple ACT, DHA-PPQ-Mefloquine, as well as OZ439-quinoline combinations, which were all found to be antagonistic.

Human participants performed an RL task without low-level sensorimotor contingencies. We observed robust RL signals related to reward processing and reward prediction errors in cognitive regions of the cerebellum (Crus I and II). These signals were not explained by oculomotor or physiological confounds. By manipulating the delay between choices and reward outcomes, we discovered that cerebellar RL signals are temporally sensitive: robust when feedback was delivered shortly following choices, but undetectable at supra-second feedback delays. Similar delay effects were not found in other areas implicated in reward processing, including the ventral striatum and hippocampus. Further, reward prediction error activity in the cerebellum was related to behavioral performance when feedback was delivered promptly, but not when it was delayed. Connectivity analyses revealed that during RL feedback, cognitive areas of the cerebellum coactivate with a network that includes the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus. Together, these results highlight a temporally constrained contribution of the human cerebellum to a cognitive learning task.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

I analysed the role of Laminin5 (basal lamina component) in the establishment and maintenance of apicobasal polarity, in developing bi-layered zebrafish epidermis. I found that the loss of laminin 5 function results in reduced E-cadherin localization and increased cell spreading along with dynamic cell boundaries and increased cell proliferation indicating acquisition of mesenchymal traits. A similar phenotype was observed in integrin 6b mutant, which did not exacerbate in the double mutant embryos indicating that laminin 5 and integrin 6b function in the same pathway. Interestingly, periderm, the cell layer above basal epidermis, maintains its apicobasal polarity and epithelial integrity presumably via reinforcing the localization of aPKC and Lgl.

A cryo-EM structure of SCFFBH1 bound to DNA representing a stalled fork reveals an intimate interaction between FBH1 and the fork junction. Disruption of this interface severely curtails fork reversal in vitro and replication progression in cells, providing a model for how ssDNA translocation by FBH1 facilitates annealing of parental DNA by a fundamentally different mechanism than the fork remodelers SMARCAL, HLTF, and ZRANB3. The structure also provides a model for SCFFBH1 disassembly of RAD51 filaments through translocation and ubiquitination, and implies that RAD51 is associated with the lagging strand at stalled forks.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Diatoms are a major phytoplankton group for which many parasites have been describe including chytrids and oomycetes, yet host defense mechanisms remain poorly studied, limiting our understanding of the factors that constrain or promote infection events in natural environments. Major challenges in investigating diatom-parasite interactions include obtaining cultivable host-parasite pairs, maintain stable co-cultures with synchronized infection stages, and harvesting sufficient biomass for molecular analyses such as transcriptomics and metabolomics. To address these challenges, we focused on the bloom-forming diatom Coscinodiscus granii, a large species (200 um) to allow manual isolation of single cells. This diatom is naturally infected by Lagenisma coscinodisci, an abundant oomycete occasionally observed in temperate coastal environments. We assembled high-quality transcriptomes for both C. granii and L. coscinodisci, providing an important resource for future molecular studies. Transcriptome analyses revealed a sophisticated effector repertoire in L. coscinodisci, including canonical oomycete virulence factors such as Crinklers, RxLR effectors, cystatins, transposon-associated proteins, and components of the RNA interference machinery (Argonaute, Dicer, RdRP), as well as cyclophilins. In the differential gene expression analyses, C. granii exhibited a transcriptional response involving proteases and exosome-related pathways, suggesting a deeply conserved, defense mechanism. In parallel, we analysed the differential expression of the heterotrophic flagellate Pteridomonas sp., which consistently co-occurred in culture, and identified a distinct transcriptional profile characterized by the upregulation of motility-related genes, highlighting a striking mobility strategy. Owing to the exceptionally large host size and the availability of both transcriptomic and metabolomic data, this tripartite system provides a unique marine model for exploring oomycete-diatom interactions.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Using a murine model, we explore the role of rodA, which encodes a peptidoglycan polymerase RodA, belonging to the Shape, Elongation, Division, and Sporulation (SEDS) family that participates in peptidoglycan synthesis and maintenance of cell wall integrity. We investigated the contribution of rodA to GBS gastrointestinal (GI) colonization using a wild-type strain (A909 WT) and an isogenic in-frame deletion mutant of rodA (A909{Delta}rodA). Morphological differences between the two strains were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the contribution of rodA to GI colonization was assessed in a murine model through monocolonization and cocolonization experiments. We evaluated the growth of the mutant strain under intestinal physiological stress conditions and characterized its interactions with host epithelial cells in vitro. A909{Delta}rodA showed a unique chaining/aggregation phenotype compared to the A909 WT strain, with the presence of capsule confirmed via TEM and immunoblotting. In murine cocolonization experiments, A909 WT outcompeted A909{Delta}rodA; however, monocolonization experiments exhibited comparable colonization and bacterial burden across the GI tract. In vitro experiments revealed impaired growth in bile and an increase in adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells by the {Delta}rodA mutant. rodA plays a role in GBS intestinal colonization. Deletion of rodA increases sensitivity to gastrointestinal stressors in vitro and causes a pronounced defect in competition in vivo, suggesting that the presence of rodA increases the fitness of GBS in the gut.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Mediated by its low-complexity C-terminal domain (CTD), TDP-43 can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form aggregates and fibrils. These phase transitions are associated with pathological TDP-43 mislocalization and cytoplasmic aggregation. What determines whether and when TDP-43 adopts a liquid droplet state or forms solid aggregates, transiently or irreversibly? A full understanding of the underlying biophysical mechanisms will help explain the cellular toxicity of aberrant forms of TDP-43 and similar proteins, such as some of the large family of RNA-binding proteins. In this study, we generated recombinant full-length TDP-43 and maintained soluble-protein working solutions without the need of a solubility tag. By focusing on conditions that tune the electrostatic characteristics, we induced phase transitions among states of soluble TDP-43, solid aggregates, and liquid droplet phases in an expedient and controlled manner. We also obtained soluble working solutions of TDP-CTD and another crucial splicing factor, hnRNPH1, and investigated their phase behaviors as individual proteins and their interactions between each other during phase transitions.

P.", "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that the visual system anticipates upcoming visual input contingent on the execution of saccadic eye movements. In line with this idea, it has been shown that changes in visual input across saccades elicit stronger post-saccadic fixation-locked neural responses compared to no-change conditions; an effect known as the preview effect. In the present study, we demonstrate that this preview effect depends on active vision and cannot be explained by either classical or spatiotopic adaptation. In a gaze-contingent experiment, in which participants were cued to make saccades to object stimuli, we concurrently recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking data. The source-localized MEG signal was deconvolved with stimulus onset and eye movement events in order to account for systematic variation in gaze behavior related to the no-change (valid preview) and change (invalid preview) conditions. Crucially, preview effects in the primary visual and in ventral-occipital cortices were markedly larger when participants made saccades compared to replay blocks in which we simulated the visual consequences of saccades absent saccade execution, demonstrating that the preview effect cannot be simply explained by classic adaptation. A further control condition ruled out spatiotopic adaptation. Our results show that early visual cortical areas which are not known to exhibit saccadic remapping neurons still show signs of sequential neural history effects across saccades. Previous research might have overlooked this influence of active vision because of the lack of an invalid preview condition which breaks the correspondence between pre-saccadic extrafoveal and post-saccadic foveal stimulation.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

S. H.; Xing, G.; Ling, H.", "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is critical to error-free lesion bypass in the DNA damage response. This error-free lesion tolerance pathway is initiated by the RAD51 recombinase, which forms nucleoprotein filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to facilitate template-directed repair using homologous sister chromatids. RAD51 filaments are tightly regulated by RAD51 mediator proteins. Among these, the Shu complexes facilitate HR-directed DNA damage tolerance and are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. The Caenorhabditis elegans Shu complex is a heterotrimer consisting of three protein subunits: RFS1, RIP1, and SWS1. However, the biochemical properties of this trimeric complex remain unclear. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the C. elegans Shu complex and interactions with DNA, ATP, and Rad51 filaments. We first revealed that the Shu trimer preferentially binds DNA with an exposed 5' end, particularly favoring a fork-shaped double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Then, we found that the trimer binds to ATP and exhibits DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Through site-specific mutagenesis, we identified the catalytic residues in the RFS1 domain and validated the ATPase activity. Using fluorescence-based assays, we further demonstrated that the Shu trimer remodels RAD51 filaments in an ATP-hydrolysis-dependent manner and stabilizes the filaments in an ATP-binding-dependent manner. These findings provide key mechanistic insights into how the C. elegans Shu complex regulates RAD51 filaments, priming them for downstream HR-mediated DNA repair processes.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

However, current experimental models of GBC face critical limitations, particularly their dependence on immunodeficient hosts, which precludes the investigation of the tumor microenvironment. We aimed to establish a novel syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model that recapitulates human GBC and enables the investigation of tumor-immune interactions. Experimental Design: We engineered a murine cell line (mGBC1-ZH) from normal mouse gallbladder organoids expressing Kras and Trp53 (encoding mouse p53) mutations. Tumorigenic potential of mGBC1-ZH was evaluated by subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation. RNA-Seq and WES was used to demonstrate its characterization and similarity with human GBC. Immunohistochemistry, CCK8, and transwell assays wereused to investigate the role of CXCL5 in GBC. Therapeutic responses to standard first-line chemotherapeutic agents was evaluated in the syngeneic GBC model. Results: This model supports both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor growth in immunocompetent C57BL/6J hosts while preserving hallmark features of human GBC, including biliary epithelial differentiation (CK7+/CK19+), aggressive histopathology, and an immunosuppressive \"cold\" tumor microenvironment. Genomic characterization revealed recurrent chromosomal instability and copy number alterations mirroring human GBC. Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling revealed profound gene expression changes during the model development, and resembled transcriptional features between mGBC1-ZH and human GBC cell lines and samples. CXCL5 was found to be upregulated in human GBC, and promote proliferation, metastasis, and neutrophils infiltration of GBC in the syngeneic mouse model. Functional validation of the syngeneic GBC model demonstrated therapeutic responsiveness to frontline chemotherapeutics gemcitabine and cisplatin with significant in vivo tumor regression. Conclusions: In summary, we establised a novel syngeneic GBC mouse model, overcoming the limitations of traditional models by enabling studies in immunocompetent hosts. This model provides valuable insights into the molecular evolution from normal gallbladder cells to transformed cancer cells and establishes a robust platform for both mechanistic studies and therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

This interaction simultaneously drives peripheral pain, making this pathway an attractive but complicated therapeutic target for chronic pain. By integrating single-molecule microscopy, structural and electrophysiology analyses, with a human NGF variant, NGFpainless, which retains neurotrophic effects but abolishes pain, we delineate the molecular mechanisms that bias TrkA signaling towards neurotrophic functions without triggering nociception. We show that, unlike wild-type NGF, NGFpainless fails to sensitize TRPV1 channels to capsaicin, thus disengaging TrkA from the nociceptive pathway. We further show that this selective loss of nociceptive TrkA signaling by NGFpainless results from its reduced ability to activate PLC{gamma}1 and trigger calcium release compared to NGF, while still preserving the ERK and AKT signaling essential for neurotrophic functions. This biased signaling arises from reduced electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless complex interface, which shortens the lifetime of this functional complex on native membranes. Mutations in TrkA that restore the electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless interface eliminate biased signaling. This mechanistic understanding of TrkA binding by NGFpainless, and how it differs from NGF, will spur the development of two therapeutic classes of molecules - one that selectively suppresses nociceptive signaling while preserving neurotrophic functions in chronic pain, and another that enhances neurotrophic activity without evoking peripheral pain in neurodegenerative conditions.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

In a second experiment, we asked a new sample of 50 Japanese adults to predict two model-derived sequences that were empirically calibrated to the group-level statistics from the first Experiment (Competitive-like vs Random-like). We found a paradox: the repetitive sequences intended to be unpredictable were in fact more predictable than the alternating sequences intended to be random. This paradox appears to stem from an asymmetric reinforcement learning mechanism, whereby success selectively strengthens beliefs in repetition but not alternation.

In addition, adh-1 is transcriptionally activated in yeast, worms, mice, and humans in response to caloric restriction-an intervention that extends not only lifespan but also healthspan. Therefore, we investigated whether activating adh-1 could also extend healthspan. We demonstrate here that adh-1 activation has broad and robust effects on health, including resistance to age-related obesity, delayed sarcopenia, and attenuated neurodegeneration.

Integration of DEGs with single-cell RNA-sequencing data from rodents and humans revealed that fentanyl DEGs were enriched in specific habenula and amygdala cell type markers. Furthermore, fentanyl downregulated DEGs in amygdala were enriched in genes associated with risk for substance use disorders.

C.", "abstract": "Across psychology, economics, machine learning, and neuroscience, it is well established that choosing a good internal representation can make complex problems easier to solve. Thus, intelligent behavior depends not only on what is stored in working memory, but on the format in which it is stored. Selecting a lower-load format can substantially reduce the mental effort required for a task, since working-memory load is a major contributor to cognitive cost. Whether non-human animals make such representational choices, and how these choices are implemented in neural circuits, has remained unclear. Here we show that rats flexibly adjust the format of working memory to reduce cognitive cost. In an egocentric task that encourages an action-based code, rats maintained the relevant information as a stable motor plan supported by frontal cortex. When the same behavioral problem was reformulated in allocentric coordinates, the action-based code became costly, and rats instead stored a sensory trace in auditory cortex. A cost-sensitive model explains which internal format should be used under each task variant and predicted that simplifying the allocentric task would reduce the advantage of a sensory code and drive reinstatement of frontal motor planning; this prediction was confirmed, as rats rapidly returned to a motor-plan representation and the frontal cortex again became necessary for performance. These results demonstrate that flexible representational selection is not unique to humans but is present in rodents and reflected in circuit-level reallocation of working memory. This establishes a neural basis for classic theories linking problem representation to computational efficiency and provides a path toward a circuit-level understanding of how the brain selects internal formats to reduce cognitive cost.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Extracellular protease activity was also screened to understand how N. limnetica digests and utilises proteins in the medium. A signal-peptide based approach predicted seven proteases expected to be secreted.N. limnetica rapidly depleted nutrients (ksugar = 0.20 {+/-} 0.06 day-1 and kproteins = 0.17 {+/-} 0.04 day-1) from the wastewater, which could then be reused for subsequent LPC extraction processes without any impact on recovery or purity.

To advance OUD treatment, it is necessary to improve understanding of how synthetic opioids impact the brain and promote persistent use. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) sends diverse projections to several regions including nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), and is critical for opioid reward. Previous work shows downstream projection target influences baseline properties and opioid-induced neuroadaptations in VTA, but most work has focused on natural opioids and single neurotransmitter-defined cell-types. As such, there is limited understanding of how diverse VTA cell-types function together to mediate drug-directed behaviors through their shared circuit outputs. Here, we investigate how projection-defined VTA neurons exhibit differential responses to the synthetic opioid fentanyl in male and female mice. We used RNA sequencing and weighted gene co-expression network analysis to show that fentanyl induces discordant transcriptional adaptations in VTA neurons that project to NAc vs PFC. We then used in vivo calcium imaging and chemogenetics to determine functional differences in how these projections encode fentanyl-related behavior. We found different timescales of activation between VTA-NAc and VTA-PFC during conditioned place preference that support distinct aspects of fentanyl-context association.

To address this limitation, we propose InvGraphCox (Invariant Graph Cox), a novel framework that integrates graph-structured representation learning with robust survival modeling. InvGraphCox constructs a k-nearest-neighbor patient graph to capture local manifold structures and employs a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) combined with a cohort-wise alignment mechanism to learn low-dimensional patient embeddings that are invariant to site-specific biases.

Genetic analysis of VH3-53/3-66-encoded bnAbs reveals a convergent somatic hypermutation pattern at seven positions in and around the CDR loops that emerges with repeated viral exposures and distinguishes them from non-bnAbs. Grafting these combined mutations onto clinically escaped antibodies broadens their breadth and restores neutralization activity. Structural analysis shows that these convergent mutations cooperatively remodel CDRs to bind and tolerate virus receptor-binding domain mutations. Using an AI-based antibody language model trained on data linking somatic hypermutations to binding affinity and neutralization, the model is able to identify mutational patterns predictive of breadth, enabling the discovery of a rare bnAb with protective activity against the latest variants from early-pandemic antibody repertoires. This demonstrates the feasibility of establishing an AI-empowered pipeline to identify mutation-tolerant bnAbs from early-pandemic antibody repertoires to fight fast-evolving newly introduced viruses.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

We evaluated mortality-based management of intermediate copepod hosts to control Guinea worm (GW) transmission, combining mathematical models with a population dynamics experiment designed to mimic current pesticide control methods across a range of intensities. Despite initial reductions in density, copepods recovered so rapidly that control appeared to fail, enabled by extremely fast maturation rates in low-density populations. However, model simulations of GW transmission showed that although total and stage-specific densities rebounded, infectious adult copepods, the proximate cause of infections, were strongly suppressed, indicating cryptic success.

Using these models, we identified violations of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) in humans and rodents across wakefulness, anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness. Mirroring the patterns observed with PCI, we found decreased FDT violations in unresponsive disorders of consciousness and anesthesia compared to conscious conditions. This reveals a close link between PCI and non-equilibrium dynamics in spontaneous brain signals, grounding PCI in fundamental principles of physics. Overall, this framework offers new complementary, non-invasive, model-based avenues for understanding the nature of consciousness and for developing objective tools to assess its loss and recovery in health and disease.

High light (HL) and heat stress (HS) are two major abiotic factors that commonly co-occur in nature and severely impair photosynthetic performance when combined. The bZIP transcription factor HY5 is a well-known integrator of light and temperature cues, but its role under combined HLHS stress remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the role of HY5 in Arabidopsis tolerance to HLHS using wild-type (Col-0), HY5-deficient (hy5-215), and HY5-overexpressing (HY5OX) lines. Physiological and biochemical analyses revealed that HY5OX plants maintained higher photosynthetic efficiency, lower membrane damage, and improved leaf health under HLHS, while hy5-215 mutants were hypersensitive. Proteomic profiling showed that HLHS induced distinct HY5-dependent changes in the accumulation of photosynthesis-related proteins, particularly Photosystem II core subunits D1 and D2. NPQ4/PsbS, a key component of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), was identified as a direct downstream target of HY5, with impaired NPQ activation in hy5-215 and npq4-1 mutants correlating with higher Y(NO), lower Fv/Fm, and increased oxidative damage. Hormonal profiling further revealed that HY5 is required for proper ABA and JA signaling under HLHS: hy5-215 mutants failed to induce ABA accumulation and showed disrupted JA signaling despite strong hormone accumulation. Our findings highlight HY5 as a central regulator of tolerance to combined HLHS stress, acting through the transcriptional coordination of photoprotective proteins and hormonal signaling networks. This work provides new insights into how plants integrate environmental and hormonal cues to protect the photosynthetic machinery under multifactorial stress.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

To address this, we presented natural stimuli from different categories as well as several degraded versions, in which specific visual features were selectively manipulated, to human participants while recording magnetoencephalography (MEG). We applied multivariate pattern analysis and decomposed the resulting high-dimensional neural representational geometry into its distinct contributions from retinotopy, total spatial frequency and orientation energy, global shape, local shape, and textural correlation structure. These features contributed differentially to the neural information, with retinotopy and global shape being the strongest features underlying image and category information, respectively.

Using PERCEPT, we tested cytokines and innate immune agonists in melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and identified the dsRNA mimetic, RIG-I agonist, Stem Loop RNA (SLR) 14 as a powerful inducer of anti-viral states and enhancer of T cell activation. We compared transcriptional responder and non-responder patient samples and identified midkine (MDK), a multifunctional cytokine, as a potent repressor of IFN signaling in both tumor and immune cells.

Our approach compares the rank of per-gene deviance under a binomial model (i) with and (ii) without including a covariate in the model that is associated with the known bias or technical artifact.

H.; Hefendehl, J.", "abstract": "Fibrotic scar formation after stroke serves a dual role: while essential for providing structural support during post-ischemic recovery, excessive fibrosis in the chronic phase of stroke impairs regenerative processes including axonal regrowth and neovascularization. The temporal dynamics of fibrosis are critical determinants of functional outcomes, as the balance between protective scarring and regenerative capacity differs across distinct stroke phases. Consequently, strategic modulation of fibrotic processes to preserve regenerative potential represents a promising therapeutic approach in stroke recovery. To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this fibrotic response, we investigated stromal progenitor cell composition in the post-stroke brain. The vast majority of stromal progenitor cells (SPCs) are pericytes, with minorities comprising perivascular fibroblasts (PVFs) and vascular smooth muscle cells. We demonstrate that ischemic stroke drives a long-term shift in this composition, characterized by sustained expansion of the PVF population and excessive laminin deposition in the peri-infarct region-effects that persist for at least six months post-stroke. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed sustained transcriptional and compositional alterations in the SPC population throughout chronic post-stroke phase, driven by AP-1-mediated signaling via TNF in both PVFs and pericytes. These changes correlate with long-term vasomotor dysfunction and capillary constriction in the peri-infarct region at six weeks post-stroke. Ischemic stroke drives aberrant, persistent PVF accumulation at the capillary bed with implications for post-stroke cerebrovascular dysfunction and recurrent stroke. Taken together, these findings reveal that ischemic stroke drives an aberrant long-term mis-localization of PVFs to the capillary bed that may have clinically-relevant implications for post-stroke cerebrovascular function as well as potential ramifications for recurrent stroke.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

To address this, we developed TNSEEK, a fully automated bioinformatics pipeline for the systematic and comparative analysis of transposon sequencing experiments. We applied TNSEEK to analyze six Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae (SRP) strains, encompassing species from the Dickeya and Pectobacterium genera, grown in a rich medium. This approach identified a core essentialome of 225 genes, primarily involved in fundamental cellular maintenance, conserved across all six strains, a set comparable in size to that of the broader Enterobacteriaceae family. Only a few genus-specific essential genes were found highlighting interesting distinct metabolic capabilities between Dickeya and Pectobacterium genera. In striking contrast, we discovered a large variable essentialome comprising 181 strain-specific genes, many of which of unknown function. A portion of these strain-specific essential genes are components of defense systems and prophage genomic regions. The unexpected essentiality of these modules suggests they form a constitutively active frontline defense. Furthermore, a comparison with the E. coli essentialome demonstrates that discrepancies in gene essentiality can often be attributed to differences in growth conditions, particularly temperature, as well as variations in genetic redundancy.

This study addresses that gap by evaluating a range of MHC representations within the BigMHC EL framework. We compared pseudosequence definitions based on protein structure and evolutionary diversity, a randomly sampled pseudosequence baseline, pseudosequences of varying lengths, embeddings generated using the ESM-2 protein language model, and a graph-based annotation embedding derived from allele groupings. Models using biologically informed pseudosequences consistently outperformed the random baseline, underscoring the importance of residue selection. Protein structure and evolutionary diversity pseudosequences showed similar performance, likely reflecting overlap in residues near the peptide-binding groove. We also found that pseudosequences of approximately 30 to 35 residues produced the strongest performance. Lastly, ESM-2 and annotation-based embeddings outperformed the random baseline but did not surpass curated pseudosequences under the current setup.

Our analysis revealed several oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRNAs that closely correlated with patient outcomes. Importantly, we were able to identify DDR genes that were highly targeted by multiple miRNAs and strongly correlated with patient overall survival.

However, the impact of gut microbes on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and response to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains unclear due to the lack of combined preclinical and clinical studies. Approach & Results: We performed 16S rRNA of cross-cohort stool samples from 10 HCC responders (R) and 40 non-responders (NR) to ICB at baseline and on-treatment time-points. We identified an enrichment of Bacteroidetes in NR. To study the role of the microbiome in the cancer immune response, we generated an immunogenic mouse model of HCC via hydrodynamic tail-vein injection (HDTVI) of DNA plasmids mimicking common HCC alterations and immunogenicity by expressing model antigens (MYC-lucOS;CTNNB1 tumors). We found that antibiotic (ABX)-induced dysbiosis promoted a pro-tumorigenic effect in the MYC-lucOS;CTNNB1 HCC model by the expansion of a specific Bacteroidetes, Parabacteroides distasonis. Colonization of mice carrying MYC-lucOS;CTNNB1 HCCs with Parabacteroides distasonis confirmed its pro-tumorigenic effect in vivo. Furthermore, we explored the effects of colonizing with microbiotas from patients and showed that microbiota from a NR donor enriched in Bacteroidetes promoted faster tumorigenesis than microbiota from a R donor with reduced Bacteroidetes. We isolated 6 Bacteroidetes species from the NR donor, cultured them, and used them as a cocktail to colonize mice; similarly, mice transplanted with this cocktail showed increased tumorigenesis and reduced survival.

It remains unclear how congenital handlessness and lifelong compensatory foot use shape the sensorimotor system beyond SI, and whether compensatory abilities can drive broader functional reorganization. Here, we used task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how compensatory foot use changes body representations in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) in people born without hands (individuals with upper-limb dysplasia, IDs). We found that IDs showed foot selectivity in the left hand-selective SII, with stronger foot activity than typically-developed (TD) control participants during action execution. Notably, this reorganization in the left SII hand area cannot simply be explained by this area's intrinsic organization - the typical secondary preference of this area in the TDs when hand responses are excluded, as this area in TDs shows shoulder - but not foot - selectivity when the hand activity is excluded. This indicates a functional reorganization dependent on the IDs' sensorimotor experience. Resting-state results further revealed altered functional connectivity between SII and primary sensorimotor regions in IDs.

Higher entropy in many of these regions was associated with worse physical function and higher body mass index in older adults. Findings suggest that spatial entropy in brain network landscapes may be a marker of declining physical function. Modifiable factors, such as losing excess weight, may help to ameliorate aging-related brain entropy increases in regions such as the sensorimotor cortex, which may in turn help to preserve physical function in older adults.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Yet their diversity and disease relevance in the central nervous system remain incompletely defined. Here, we generate a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of 176 samples, integrating 2 in-house and 16 publicly available datasets. It encompasses more than 1,000,000 cells (350,000 oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursors) from the human motor cortex and spinal cord in non-neurological controls and ALS patients. We identify a previously unrecognized oligodendrocyte subpopulation, marked by PPEF1, and uncover regional differences, with distinct OPALIN+ and RBFOX1+ oligodendrocyte proportions between cortex and spinal cord. Importantly, we demonstrate that 'disease-associated oligodendrocytes' (DAOs) represent a distinct activation state, rather than a distinct subpopulation. In ALS, spinal cord oligodendrocytes selectively shift toward reactive states, characterized by JUND-enriched regulon activity, heightened metabolic demand, increased intercellular signaling, and activation of cell-death pathways. Finally, we identify LRP2 as a novel transcriptional oligodendrocyte marker and find LRP2 and MBP proteins to be elevated in ALS cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), offering a potential biomarker of oligodendrocyte dysfunction. Our study provides a systems-level framework to interpret oligodendrocyte and OPC changes in ALS, linking cell state shifts to molecular alterations that can guide biomarker and therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Rescue of swelling through pharmacological restoration of lysosomal ionic imbalances from PIKfyve inhibition suppresses LRRK2 activation without restoring lysosomal function. Mechanical lysosomal swelling from indigestible osmolyte uptake causes a dose-dependent increase in LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation on both swollen and non-swollen lysosomes. Together, these findings identify LRRK2 as a sensor of lysosomal volume and mechanical stress, not specifically membrane damage or PIKfyve inhibition.

Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency is considered a major risk factor for MS. While VitD is associated with immunomodulatory roles, the exact mechanisms by which VitD protects from disease are still largely unknown. CD4 T cells play a key role in MS pathogenesis with autoimmune effector T cells (Teff) infiltrating the CNS across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and regulatory T cells (Treg) displaying impaired functions. Here we show that treatment of human CD4 T cells with the active form of VitD (1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3; 1,25(OH)2D3) decreased cell-surface expression of 4{beta}1- and L{beta}2-integrins on Teff but not Treg and reduced Teff adhesion to their endothelial ligands VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. By employing live cell imaging, we observed that VitD treatment reduced arrest of Teff but not Treg to the BBB as well as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 under physiological flow in vitro and differentially affected post-arrest behaviour of Teff versus Treg on the BBB under physiological flow. Furthermore, VitD treatment favoured the migration of Treg over Teff across the BBB under static and flow conditions in vitro. In vivo live cell imaging showed that VitD reduced T cell arrest on the inflamed BBB during autoimmune neuroinflammation. Finally, VitD also reduced expression of integrins mediating CNS homing on pathogenic CD4 T cells isolated from the CSF of persons with MS (PwMS). As VitD treatment did not alter barrier properties or adhesion molecule profile of our BBB model we propose a beneficial effect of VitD supplementation in PwMS by reducing CNS trafficking of pro-inflammatory T cells while leaving CNS entry of Treg unaffected.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Individual T cells, however, are only exposed to a small fraction of all self peptides during their ``training'' in the thymus, and it is puzzling how tolerance can be generalized to the remaining \"test\" self peptides across peripheral tissues in the body. Using a machine learning perspective, we show that such generalization is possible because the immune system satisfies two conditions: first that peptide abundance levels in the human thymus and periphery are highly correlated (i.e., training distribution {approx} test distribution), and second that cross-reactivity allows T cells to effectively learn binding information of similar peptides without explicitly interacting with all of them. Together, we show that sparse, random sampling of only 10% of self peptides in the thymus is sufficient to avoid reactivity to 90% of peripheral self, and we support this result with diverse experimental data. We then validate two predictions by our model; the first is that only 200--250 antigen presenting cells need to be seen by a T cell to ensure its robust selection, and the second relates how peptides missing from the thymus can drive auto-immunity of peripheral tissues. Overall, we provide a plausible answer to a long-standing question underlying adaptive immunity, and we highlight how generalization, a fundamental challenge faced by nearly every learning algorithm, is uniquely tackled by the immune system.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase integrates nutrient signaling with chromatin regulation, yet whether chromatin stability feeds back to mTORC1 activation and stress adaption remains unknown. We previously identified histone H3 at lysine 37 (H3K37) as essential for the response to mTORC1 stress such that mutation of H3K37 to alanine (H3K37A) causes cell death upon mTORC1 inhibition. Herein, we show that H3K37-dependent chromatin stability prevents proteasome-mediated histone degradation, restricts mTORC1 signaling, and safeguards mitochondrial homeostasis during mTORC1 stress. Genetic interaction analyses reveal that H3K37A combined with mutants that destabilize chromatin, including loss of the Set2 H3K36 methyltransferase, Rpd3S histone deacetylase, or multiple histone deposition pathways, causes synthetic lethality when mTORC1 is inhibited. Transcriptome analysis indicates that H3K37A misregulates the mitochondrial transcriptome during mTORC1 stress, which increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggers lethal mitochondrial retrograde signaling. Inactivation of retrograde signaling, or ROS neutralization, rescues viability of H3K37A and chromatin stability mutants during mTORC1 stress. These findings establish chromatin stability as a key safeguard that restrains mTORC1 activity and prevents toxic mitochondrial stress during metabolic adaptation.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Current approaches to infer cell differentiation maps from cell lineage trees make unrealistic assumptions about the developmental process, do not allow for unobserved progenitor cell types, or do not infer cell-type specific rates of growth and transitions. To address these issues, we introduce TROUPE, a likelihood-based framework that infers differentiation and growth dynamics directly from leaf-labeled cell lineage trees while allowing for unobserved progenitor types via biologically motivated potency constraints. We provide an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood transition and growth rates, as well as a simple model-selection scheme to choose the number of unobserved types. On simulations, TROUPE recovers transition and growth rates better than previous approaches even when there are unobserved types.

Camera traps are widely used for non-intrusive, continuous surveys of large animals but have not yet been extensively adopted for monitoring insects. An automated camera trap system could improve current insect survey methods, which often rely on lethal traps or in-person observation. We developed an open-source, low-cost camera trap for monitoring wild insects and evaluated its performance relative to established sampling approaches. The system used a low-power microcomputer to collect time-lapse images on colored platforms. We trained whole-image and tiled deep-learning object detection models to detect insects in images captured by the traps. We found that tiled inference models significantly improved detection accuracy and outperformed human review. Bumble bee visitation was highest on platforms featuring a fluorescent bullseye pattern; adding a fluorescent coat to blue platforms increased visitation modestly. With continuous monitoring, the cameras recorded bumble bee visits during all daylight hours. Over 18 days, camera traps recorded six Bombus species, yielding community composition and diversity estimates comparable to those obtained by hand netting and blue vane traps. Using our observed data, we simulated the effect of deploying variable numbers of cameras at sites with distinct levels of diversity. Adding cameras substantially increased sampling completeness, particularly in species-rich communities. Our findings demonstrate that low-cost, automated camera traps paired with deep-learning image analysis can enable scalable, nonlethal studies of bumble bee diversity and behavior.

Vibrational imaging provides high-content, biochemically informative, label-free molecular fingerprints of single cells but it remains at its infancy for dynamic or predictive analysis of cell state transition. Here, we introduce Vibrational Painting-Optimal Transport (VIP-OT), an integrated experimental-computational framework that overcomes this fundamental limitation. VIP-OT couples multiplexed infrared (IR) and Raman imaging with optimal transport to computationally reconstruct single-cell perturbation trajectories from unpaired population snapshots. When applying to over 22,000 single-cell spectra profiles from human breast adenocarcinoma cells under 16 drug treatments, this framework can retrospectively trace drug response heterogeneity back to baseline metabolic states. We leverage the inferred cell pairings to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the full post-treatment metabolic state of individual cells from their pre-treatment spectra. Furthermore, by modeling transitions across dose gradients, we introduce the concept of Spectral Velocity to map dynamic response trajectories and resolve drug combination effects into distinct, path-dependent molecular routes. Together, VIP-OT opens a new direction for dissecting heterogeneous perturbation responses at single cell resolution and serves as a foundation for building virtual simulators of cells under perturbations through high-throughput, high-content, and low-cost vibrational imaging, as well as interpretable in silico modeling.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

However, its applicability to large landscapes, especially those generated by (quasi-)random mutagenesis, remains unclear. Here, we apply both Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson Power Transforms to the extensively characterized green fluorescent protein (GFP) fitness landscape, which contains hundreds of thousands of two- and three-dimensional combinatorially complete datasets. Surprisingly, when applied to individual hypercubes, Box-Cox reduces pairwise epistasis by 19.4% on average, whereas Yeo-Johnson - despite accommodating negative values - slightly increases epistasis (by 4.45%). Moreover, in a notable fraction of hypercubes, both methods increase the magnitude of epistatic coefficients, indicating that Power Transform does not universally reduce nonlinearity at the local scale.

Existing methods including SpaGCN, BayesSpace, STAGATE, and DeepST rely heavily on supervised labels, dataset-specific fine-tuning, or deep representation learning, which often over-smooth boundaries, fail to generalize across technologies, and provide limited interpretability. We introduce NicheAgent, a zero-shot, training-free framework for spatial niche identification guided by lightweight large language models (LLMs). NicheAgent constructs interpretable nichecards for each region, encoding canonical marker genes and prototype expression centroids. Each cell is first assigned using a deterministic nearest-prototype rule based solely on gene expression and 2-hop spatial neighborhoods. Low-confidence assignments are then selectively reviewed and corrected by an LLM using only interpretable signals: marker-gene coherence, neighborhood label consistency, and an allowed label set. A final spatial smoothing step enforces local structural coherence. Applied across Visium, MERFISH, and STARmap tissues without any retraining or domain-specific supervision, NicheAgent achieves robust and biologically meaningful niche delineation, outperforming many supervised and graph-based baselines on homogeneity, completeness, and mutual information, while offering transparent reasoning traces for each corrected decision.

E.; Nuyujukian, P.; Brain Interfacing Laboratory,  ", "abstract": "Background: Covert stroke is understudied despite occurring ten times for every symptomatic stroke and contributing to stroke's enormous global disease burden. For instance, it is unknown whether covert stroke replicates the peri-infarct neuroelectrophysiological frequency spectrum impact of symptomatic stroke. This motivated the use of our novel electrolytic lesioning platform to explore the spectral consequences of covert neuron loss. Methods: During a multi-month period of participation in an arm reaching task, neuron loss was induced via electrolytic lesions to the motor cortex of two large animals (U: n = 4; H: n = 7). Behavioral metrics were paired with spectrum estimates from local field potential recordings. These spectra were represented as bandpowers, aperiodic/periodic parameters, and decomposed time-frequency tensors. Lesion impact was assessed using nonparametric permutation tests of next-day effects and state space model parameters. Results: Task success rate was unaffected by lesions, but shifts in aperiodic structure reduced next-day {gamma} bandpower (30 - 100 Hz; U: -1.38V2, p < 1 x 10-3; H: -1.66V2, p = 0.001) while sensorimotor rhythms spanning 8 - 45 Hz ({Sigma}SMR) were amplified (Monkey U: 8.68V2, p < 1 x 10-3; Monkey H: 2.40V2, p = 0.004). Additionally, state space modeling showed that spectral perturbations to {gamma} and {Sigma}SMR outlasted any behavioral impact of the lesions (Monkey U: Behavior=1 d, {gamma} =2 d, {Sigma}SMR =2 d; Monkey H: Behavior=0 d, {gamma} =3 d, {Sigma}SMR =1 d). Finally, tensor decomposition revealed interpretable, animal-specific perturbations to time-frequency dynamics. Conclusion: Covert neuron loss induced multi-day spectral perturbations similar to those observed after symptomatic stroke. The neural spectrum is thus more sensitive to neuron loss than previously understood and could be responsive to neuron loss caused by covert stroke. This work also motivates the use of electrolytic lesions to bridge covert and symptomatic regimes of neuron loss, advancing our causal understanding of post-stroke interactions between spectrum and behavior.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Challenging this model, we investigated its role in value-based decision-making by recording single-neuron activity from the primate STN during a choice task. Our findings reveal that the STN contains functionally distinct clusters of neurons and, contrary to its classical role, the vast majority of task-related neurons (approximately 89%) exhibited activity consistent with action facilitation. Two of the clusters contained facilitative neurons that increased their firing for rewarded choices, and critically, their response latency predicted saccadic reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis. Population-level analyses further demonstrated that these facilitative neurons robustly encode the upcoming choice. A smaller third cluster of neurons showed activity consistent with action suppression. These results indicate a dual function of the STN, suggesting it plays a predominant role in actively facilitating desired actions, rather than simply suppressing unwanted ones.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

The main goal was to improve our multimodal neural connectivity pipeline through the improved SNR, CNR, and spatial resolution that result from utilizing high-density RF coil arrays in combination with ultra-high field MRI. Methods: Two RF coil arrays, both comprising 8 transmit and 40 receive channels, were designed and built for in vivo and ex vivo NHP imaging at 10.5 T. Experimental data was collected on multiple in vivo and ex vivo specimens, showing the utility UHF MRI for NHP neuroscience. Results: Experimental results demonstrate uniform whole-brain coverage within both in vivo--which included the cerebellar, and spinal cord regions--and ex vivo specimens. High spatial resolutions (in vivo: 0.1x0.1x0.5 mm, ex vivo: 120 micron isotropic) were achieved, revealing detailed anatomical structures throughout. High temporal stability allowed for EPI and dMRI applications. Conclusion: An RF coil toolset comprising two 8ch transmit/40ch receive arrays was successfully designed for both in vivo and ex vivo NHP brain applications at 10.5 T. Both high-density RF coil arrays coupled with the SNR and CNR benefits available at UHF supported unmatched anatomical, functional, and diffusion applications at some of the highest spatial resolutions to date. Additionally, the combined capability of both in vivo and ex vivo MRI with the same brain specimen allows for tighter control for experimental-paradigm multistage studies examining translation between in vivo and ex vivo methodologies.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we apply a single-cell framework to resolve therapeutic heterogeneity at a resolution previously unattained in drug development efforts. Using scRNA-seq profiles from eutopic and ectopic tissues, combined with a machine learning-based drug response model, we identified compounds predicted to revert disease-associated transcriptional states and map cell-type-specific vulnerabilities across patients and tissues. Our analysis revealed pronounced tissue-specific and inter-patient heterogeneity in predicted responses. Stromal, endothelial, and stem cell populations emerged as the dominant therapeutic targets, collectively revealing selective sensitivity to two recurrent drug classes, histone deacetylase and tubulin polymerisation inhibitors. Transcriptomic comparison of predicted responders and non-responders to these drugs pointed to conserved molecular programmes involving extracellular matrix remodelling, angiogenesis, and proliferative activation. These signatures were shared between eutopic and ectopic stromal compartments, supporting the feasibility of assessing therapeutic response using readily accessible eutopic tissue. Our findings show that this single-cell framework can dissect therapeutic heterogeneity in endometriosis, support the development of precision non-hormonal therapies and identify responder subgroups relevant for patient stratification. Together, these results highlight that underlying molecular diversity in endometriosis necessitates therapeutic approaches beyond a one-size-fits-all model.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

C.; Espana-Bonilla, P.; Usieto, S.; Saade, M.", "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) architecture is established early by the organization and proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial (NE) cells, which form a pseudostratified epithelium during neural tube (NT) formation. In neurogenesis, newborn neurons have to detach and exit the neuroepithelium, in a process that requires the coordinated disassembly of apical junctions and the centrosome-cilia module. Although Rootletin, the structural component of the ciliary rootlet and centriolar linker, is classically viewed as a static mechanical element, its behavior in NE cells has not been described in detail. Here, we uncover a conserved, dynamic form of Rootletin fiber organization that remodels in synchrony with NE cell morphogenesis. We show that, in NE cells in interphase, Rootletin fibers extend from the basal body through the apical process toward the nucleus, and that Rootletin maintains its fibrous conformation throughout mitosis. As NE cells initiate apical constriction, Rootletin fibers retract from the apical process and assemble into an anisotropic rim-like structure that aligns with the apical junctional complex. This remodeling is coordinated with microtubule stabilization in low-tension apical endfeet and occurs prior to Lzts1 expression and increased actomyosin contractility. Forced neuronal delamination via Neurogenin-2 or Lzts1 promotes Rootletin rim formation and Rootletin alignment with the apical endfoot cortex. Finally, we show that Zika virus NS5 protein can aberrantly associate with all conformational states of Rootletin fibers, providing a potential mechanical link between ZikaV infection and premature delamination. Together, our findings identify Rootletin as a dynamically regulated cytoskeletal scaffold that orchestrates apical surface remodeling in NE cells and identify a potential mechanism by which ZikaV disrupts neurodevelopment.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

V.; Yeo, A.; Meleshkevich, V.; Lorenzi, H.; Rose, M. D.; Cohen-Fix, O.", "abstract": "Kar4 is a putative transcription factor required for efficient mating in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Kar4 functions with Ste12, the master transcriptional regulator of the yeast mating pheromone response, to promote the transcription of a subset of Ste12 targets required for mating. However, the mechanism by which Kar4 modulates Ste12 activity has remained uncertain. Here, we examined Kar4s function at the levels of transcription (RNA-seq) and Ste12 DNA binding (ChIP-exo). We show that Kar4 promotes Ste12 binding to nearly all Ste12 DNA-binding sites associated with transcriptionally-upregulated genes, even if their upregulation is not dependent on Kar4. We further found that the majority of Ste12-binding sites have two pheromone response elements (PREs) separated by four nucleotides in a head-to-tail orientation (H-T 4 motif). Sites associated with Kar4-dependent transcription have PREs with more mismatches and substantially lower Ste12 occupancy in kar4{Delta} cells than sites linked to Kar4-independent transcription. During the pheromone response in kar4{Delta} cells, Ste12 exhibits increased binding to non-H-T 4 motifs, particularly T-T 3 motifs, resulting in the abnormal upregulation of many genes not transcribed during the wild-type pheromone response. Therefore, we propose that Kar4 functions by increasing the DNA-binding specificity of Ste12 globally, promoting its binding primarily to H-T 4 motifs. Our model is consistent with previously-observed slower induction kinetics of Kar4-dependent genes via a feed-forward mechanism. Lastly, we uncovered several novel aspects of the pheromone response, including a broad role for the Crz1 transcription factor, induction of stress responses, and the identification of pheromone-responsive intergenic transcripts.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Emerging research findings have underscored the pivotal contribution of cellular senescence to the pathophysiological development of wounds exhibiting delayed healing; nevertheless, the molecular regulatory networks governing this process in DFU pathogenesis remain incompletely elucidated. Methods: DFU-related transcriptomic datasets were acquired from public databases. Biomarkers were identified through machine learning algorithms combined with expression validation. To evaluate the diagnostic predictive capacity of identified biomarkers for DFU, a nomogram prediction model was developed and validated. Further analyses included Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), molecular network regulation, immune infiltration profiling, and drug prediction. Subsequently, the expression profiles of these biomarkers were quantitatively assessed through reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) methodology. Results: Four feature genes were identified using machine learning. Among them, CXCR2 and SIGLEC7 passed expression validation and were significantly up-regulated in DFU groups across two datasets (p < 0.05), confirming their potential as biomarkers. A nomogram constructed based on these two biomarkers demonstrated high discriminative accuracy and good calibration (decision curve net benefit > 0, AUC = 0.99). GSEA indicated that CXCR2 and SIGLEC7 were both enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway as well as other functionally associated pathways. Molecular regulatory network analysis indicated that both CXCR2 and SIGLEC7 were predicted to be regulated by transcription factors (TFs) such as SOX2. Immune infiltration analysis showed a significant strong positive correlation between CXCR2 and activated mast cells (correlation coefficient (cor) = 0.72, p < 0.001), and between SIGLEC7 and macrophages M0 (cor = 0.71, p < 0.001). Drug prediction identified 12 drugs targeting CXCR2 (e.g., Indoprofen) and one drug targeting SIGLEC7 (N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine).

N.", "abstract": "Hypoxia is a fundamental pathophysiological stimulus that plays important roles in multiple cardiopulmonary diseases. During hypoxic stress, cells adapt by undergoing widespread transcriptional reprogramming. The conventional approach to investigating this response has largely involved RNA-seq analysis which typically quantifies transcriptional output at the level of individual genes. However, as most mammalian genes encode multiple transcripts that are divergently regulated by alternative splicing, consolidating these discrete features to the gene level can obscure critical changes within the transcriptome that are largely unappreciated. To more accurately define the role of individual transcript usage during hypoxia, herein we employed three different analytical strategies that collectively identified thousands of instances of alternative splicing in human endothelial cells undergoing hypoxic stress. Notably, the set of differentially utilized transcripts displayed minimal overlap with the genes identified to be differentially expressed by conventional RNA-seq analysis, indicating divergent usage of individual transcripts does not reliably culminate in a detectable change in overall expression. This outcome is particularly clear at the earliest time-point of hypoxia where we found the transcriptional response was mediated almost exclusively by alternative splicing. A subset of these acutely responsive genes was variably detected as differentially expressed or alternatively spliced at later time points, demonstrating hypoxic transcription is highly dynamic and temporally complex. Further, the number of genes in pathways incriminated in the hypoxic response was also expanded considerably when alternatively spliced transcripts were included in the analysis, suggesting distinct attributes of the hypoxic transcriptome are unveiled by transcript level assays that would otherwise be obfuscated by standard RNA-seq analyses that summarize expression to the gene level. Collectively, these results strongly point to alternative splicing being a significant, albeit understudied, component of the transcriptional response to hypoxic stress which is vastly more complicated than previously thought.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we discover that within seconds of sensing vitronectin, V-class integrins initiate and strengthen adhesion biphasically through complementary mechanotransduction pathways, which rely on the catch bond behavior of single V{beta}3 integrins. The first adhesion phase requires V{beta}3 and V{beta}5 integrin-associated actomyosin and FAK activity, while V{beta}5 integrin additionally requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

It comprises a catalytic subunit, POLE and three accessory subunits, including POLE2. In contrast to POLE, the biological functions and clinical significance of POLE2 remain unexplored. POLE2 is vital for the assembly of Pol{varepsilon} and for interactions with the CMG helicase. Yeast studies show that dysfunction of its ortholog, Dpb2, cause genomic instability and impaired cell cycle progression. To investigate the significance of POLE2, this study provides a comprehensive multi-omics analysis across tumor types. We show that POLE2 upregulation is associated with decreased overall survival in a cancer-type-specific manner. Its expression levels, rather than copy number variation, emerge as a more reliable prognostic marker. POLE2 expression regulatory mechanisms include promoter methylation, isoform usage, and epigenetic regulators. Elevated POLE2 mRNA levels are rarely followed by increased protein levels, possibly due to abundant non-coding isoforms. The localization of mutations in POLE2 in cancer samples suggests an effect on its interaction with the catalytic subunit of Pol{varepsilon}.

Although iron deficiency exacerbates cardiovascular disease, the direct impact of iron deficiency on the vasculature remains unstudied. We assessed iron levels across the vascular endothelium and found resistance artery endothelial cells to have the lowest iron stores suggesting they may be especially impacted by iron deficiency. Anemia has previously been shown to increase arterial NO signaling in patients, and we have previously shown endothelial -globin (Hb) scavenges nitric oxide (NO) in the resistance artery endothelium. We hypothesize iron regulates vascular function through downregulation of endothelial Hb. To test this, we used a novel model of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). In female mice, IDA increased NO signaling which was rescued to control levels by repletion of vascular iron with ferric dextran. Despite being similarly anemic and having a similar reduction in Hb protein, there were no changes in NO signaling across groups in male mice. We further measured whether Hb was in its heme-bound (holo-Hb) or heme-free (apo-Hb) state and found males did not fully lose holo-Hb. Using endothelial specific Hb knockout mice, we show loss of endothelial Hb is necessary for increased NO signaling in IDA and for the rescue of NO signaling by ferric dextran in female mice.

However, for short-term forecasting these approaches implicitly require unrealistically detailed real-time data on many covariates and an almost complete understanding of the underlying causal pathways. As a result, they offer little practical support for short-term, operational decision-making. We developed a short-term forecasting system that predicts end-of-month cumulative bear sightings from the beginning of each month by exploiting temporal autocorrelation without mechanistic assumptions, using an ensemble of multiple components: (i) sequential estimation of daily sighting rates via a non-stationary Poisson process, (ii) seasonal baselines with ratio-based corrections from previous months, and (iii) rule-based transitions among components as daily sightings accumulate. Applied to Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) sighting records from two Japanese regions differing 18-fold in encounter frequency (maximum monthly counts: 83 vs. 1490) and with contrasting seasonal peaks, the ensemble achieved correlations of > 0.8 between predicted and observed month-end totals from day 1, increasing to > 0.98 by day 20 and substantially outperforming a null model that assumed no seasonal or interannual variation (delta AIC: 477-652). After controlling for baseline spatial risk and for the region-wide daily bear-forecast level (temporal risk) provided by our ensemble, we detected strongly localized short-term recurrence in bear encounters: prior sightings increased encounter probability within 500 m for up to 3 days, with rapid decay in space and time. Synthesis and applications. This observation-based ensemble demonstrates that temporal dynamics alone can approach the practical limits of short-term predictability of wildlife encounter rates, without relying on detailed environmental covariates or extensive new data collection.

Methods: We conducted a longitudinal EWAS of 1,945 blood samples from 976 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis using a spline-based varying-coefficient model to detect age-dependent associations between DNA methylation in blood and blood pressure traits. Findings were evaluated for replication in 1,187 samples from the Framingham Heart Study. Models were adjusted for sex, ancestry, and leukocyte composition to account for cellular heterogeneity. Results: Six CpG sites showed significant age-dependent associations with systolic or pulse pressure after correction for multiple testing. These included loci within STIP1, CSRP1, and KDM6A that replicated in the Framingham cohort. Several CpG sites demonstrated a reversal of effect direction with advancing age, where higher methylation was associated with higher systolic pressure in younger adults but lower pressure later in life. Pathway enrichment analyses identified focal adhesion, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, which are processes relevant to vascular aging. Drug target mapping identified 23 FDA-approved agents interacting with genes at these loci.

Experimental analysis indicated that patients with higher HINS were more likely to undergo survival benefits following ICB therapy. Our results highlighted the transcriptional and genomic correlations between HINS-identified molecule features and ICB response, such as immunoresponsive gene enrich pathways, favorable and unfavorable genomic subgroups, and hotspot somatic events in driver genes. This study presented an interpretable, accurate deep-learning method using meaningful predictive features to predict the response to ICB, providing biological insights into the complexity of the determinants underlying immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we analyzed over 8,900 whole exomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and over 1,800 whole genomes from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium to assess how mutation callers shape de novo single-base substitution (SBS) signatures. We found that consensus calling yielded stable de novo signatures across reference genomes and pipeline versions, whereas individual callers introduced false-positive SBSs that manifested as artifactual signatures that were reproducibly detected by three independent signatures extraction tools. A minimal consensus approach requiring agreement between only two variant calling algorithms effectively removed these artifacts while preserving true biological signal. Together, these results establish consensus variant calling as essential for robust inference of de novo SBS mutational signatures and provide practical guidelines for distinguishing genuine mutational processes from technical artifacts.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Identifying such channels and their residues directly contacting the permeation pathway (i.e., ion permeation residues) is key to elucidating transport mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Leveraging the protein language model ESM-2 and curated datasets, we developed BLAPE and CLAPE frameworks for high-throughput ion channel identification and permeation residue prediction. Our models outperformed existing methods, with 33%-171% improvements in Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC) across different datasets. Analysis of amino acid composition revealed enrichment for weakly polar residues among ion permeation sites. Case studies on four diverse ion channels highlighted that CLAPE consistently outperforms existing predictors and remains applicable to proteins lacking experimental structures, while also complementing structure-based pipelines such as AlphaFold3.

By systematic interrogating a group of genes associated with transfer RNA (tRNA) biology (termed as tRNA biogenesis), here we establish tRNA biogenesis as an overall oncogenic pathway in, and identify valyl-tRNA synthetase (VARS1) as the key underlying driver of, PCa progression. Targeting VARS1 reduces the charged levels of valine tRNAs, inhibits global translation and suppresses aggressive PCa both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, knocking down VARS1 does not preferentially impact on translation of valine-rich transcripts, but instead switches the usage of PCa-preferred GTA and GTT codons to GTC and GTC codons, which are optimal in normal prostates. Mechanistically, overexpressed VARS1 in PCa selectively accelerates the translation of genes with high GTA and GTT codon content that are functionally tied to cell mitosis and cancer-promoting pathways. Dietary valine restriction (VR) reduces global translation and slows the growth of both AR+ and AR- xenograft models. We have also developed a VARS1 inhibitor that suppresses autochthonous prostate tumours by targeting its aminoacylation activity. Altogether, our studies indicate that VARS1 acts as an oncogene promoting PCa progression through codon-selective translational rewiring, and therefore represents a therapeutic target susceptible to dietary VR and small molecule therapy.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Transmembrane protein 2 (TMEM2), a cell-surface hyaluronidase that degrades hyaluronan (HA), has been implicated in extracellular matrix homeostasis. Here, we delineate the spatiotemporal expression pattern of TMEM2 in mouse knee joints and assess its functional role during OA development. Single-cell RNA sequencing and histological analyses of normal joints revealed predominant Tmem2 expression in non-calcified articular chondrocytes and synovial cells. Following destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM), Tmem2 was transiently upregulated during early OA, particularly within the non-calcified cartilage zone, coinciding with a pronounced reduction in HA content indicative of accelerated HA turnover. In contrast, Tmem2 expression declined at later stages, suggesting a temporally restricted activation phase. Functionally, Tmem2 deficiency exacerbated DMM-induced OA, leading to more severe structural deterioration, increased chondrocyte apoptosis, reduced proliferation, and elevated type X collagen, consistent with impaired cartilage homeostasis. Collectively, these findings identify TMEM2 as a key regulator of HA metabolism and a context-dependent modulator of OA progression. We propose that early, transient TMEM2 upregulation represents an adaptive remodeling response, whereas dysregulated or prolonged activity may contribute to HA depletion and cartilage breakdown.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Many critical tumor properties, such as invasiveness and growth, depend on both specific transcriptomic changes in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, computational methods to study clinical phenotypes of spatial regions, such as hazard and drug response, have not yet been developed. Since clinical phenotypes are measured at the patient level and not at the level of spatial regions, such a method would require transferring knowledge from the patient level domain to the spot level domain. To overcome this challenge, we developed SpacePhenotyper. Our approach uses algebraic spectral techniques to transfer the predictive relationship between gene expression and clinical phenotypes from bulk gene expression data to SRT data. Our approach captures a gene expression pattern that is predictive of the phenotype of interest in the form of a vector, the Eigen-Patient, which is then used to quantify the phenotype in spatial spots. After extensively validating SpacePhenotyper on simulated and real data, we utilize it to study how the spatial heterogeneity of breast cancer tumors influences residual cancer burden after treatment. By assigning relative quantities of clinical phenotypes to spatial locations, SpacePhenotyper has proven a powerful tool for the identification and interpretation of transcriptional changes over spatial regions and of spatially-regulated patterns of cellular states.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we developed React-to-Me (https://reactome.org/chat), a domain-specific conversational assistant that enables users to query Reactome using natural language while maintaining scientific rigor and source traceability.

Computational benchmarking confirmed that combining semantic vector search with keyword-based matching substantially improved contextual grounding and factual precision relative to dense-only retrieval baselines. In blinded expert evaluations, grounded responses were more likely to receive higher quality ratings than ungrounded counterparts, with significant gains in factual accuracy, biological specificity, and mechanistic depth.

While species-level effects of climate risk are widely investigated, habitat-level exposure to climate change has rarely been assessed. This reduces the comprehensiveness of habitat state assessment under the Habitats Directive, and risks creating a blind spot on Protected Area effectiveness. Here we quantified the future (year 2050) climatic exposure of 139 EUNIS level-3 habitats across Italy, using two complementary metrics: analog velocity and multivariate magnitude. We found that median analog velocity was generally modest (median = 0.15; Std = 0.41 km/y), and only a few habitats exceeded the critical velocity threshold of 0.5 km/yr. Instead, magnitude was typically high (median = 6.54; Std = 0.80) and 77% of habitat exceeded the critical threshold of 6.18. We also found a few habitats (2.15%) concurrently facing high velocity and high magnitude of climate change, mainly located in Apulia and Veneto. Mediterranean annual-rich dry grasslands and montane unvegetated inland shores were among the most exposed habitats (magnitudes {approx} 7.1 - 7.3; velocities {approx} 0.42 - 0.66 km/y), while cliff and mountain forest habitats in Sardinia and Sicily showed the lowest exposure.

Common variants in CACNA1C are associated with psychiatric disorders, while rare single-nucleotide variants cause CACNA1C-related disorder (CRD), a multi-system disorder with symptoms that include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and seizures. However, the cellular mechanisms linking CACNA1C dysfunction to neurodevelopmental phenotypes remain poorly understood. Methods: We generated isogenic CACNA1C loss-of-function (LoF) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and reprogrammed a line from an individual carrying a novel gain-of-function (GoF) variant in CACNA1C. Neuronal activity was assessed using multi-electrode arrays (MEA), pharmacological manipulation, and gene expression analysis. Early developmental phenotypes were examined using qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing. Results: LoF and GoF patient-derived neurons displayed opposing alterations in network dynamics. Pharmacological and molecular assays indicated that these network differences were associated with dysregulated GABAergic signalling. Early developmental analysis revealed that loss of CACNA1C altered rosette morphology, CREB phosphorylation, and transcriptional programs related to axonogenesis and synaptic signalling, indicating effects on neuronal differentiation. The patient line exhibited opposing phenotypes, reflecting variant-specific effects. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that Cav1.2 regulates excitatory-inhibitory balance, network organization, and aspects of neurodevelopment. Divergent effects of LoF and GoF variants highlight how altered Cav1.2 signalling contributes to variable neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including ASD and epilepsy, and establish a framework for defining CACNA1C variant effects in human neurons.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

This region has been referred to as the \"neural manifold\" associated with a task. More recently, recordings of neural activity in animals challenged to perform multiple tasks have suggested that each task is associated with a different low-dimensional manifold. What connectivity structures underlie this flexibility in neural dynamics, and how is interference between the dynamics associated with different tasks avoided? We develop a theoretical model for multi-task computation in nonlinear recurrent neural networks whose connectivity is constructed as a weighted sum of many low-rank components, each encoding the dynamics associated with a different task. The model demonstrates that interference between different tasks' dynamics limits flexible multi-tasking and can lead to chaotic fluctuations. However, small modulations of a network's effective connectivity overcome this interference. We derive the conditions that enable such task selection and characterize both single-neuron and population statistics in task-selected and unselected states. The model reveals the requirements for a single network to produce distinct dynamics confined to distinct neural manifolds and suggests circuit mechanisms that support this capability. Using the model, we propose different hypotheses for explaining the origin of high-dimensional neural activity in large-scale recordings.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

We compared synchronization patterns in two distinct social groups: Religious (N = 21) and Secular (N = 21). Participants were scanned while watching short video clips with religious or neutral content and then answered questions about their reactions and interpretations. Behavioral results did not reveal group differences in the homogeneity of responses: neither in engagement and agreement while watching the videos, nor in the emotions and verbal reactions elicited by them. However, neuroimaging revealed strikingly higher in-group synchronization among Religious participants than among Secular participants, across both religious and neutral narratives. Remarkably, it was possible to predict the religious affiliation of each participant solely from in-group neural synchrony, with accuracy up to 92%. This pattern was consistent across all neural networks, most prominently in the Default Mode Network (DMN), Control, and Attention networks. It also emerged in the Salience network and Somatomotor regions, hinting at neural processes that may foster group cohesion and identification. We propose that increased neural synchrony in the Religious group is driven mainly by a more homogeneous social structure, suggesting a novel perspective on the role of neural synchrony in group dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Leveraging these \"neural fingerprints\", we developed a novel framework for Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD) that shifts from traditional temporal envelope tracking to spatial speaker identification. By decoupling the decoding of \"who\" is speaking from \"when\" they are speaking, our modular system achieves state-of-the-art speech extraction, particularly in short time windows (<2 seconds) where temporal models typically fail. Furthermore, we observed a reciprocal shift in neural activity during attentional switches, confirming that these spatial codes dynamically track listener intent.

We made constructs producing VLPs of the prototype EVD68 strain Fermon and the USA/2018-23088 (Ohio-2018) strain from a recent outbreak in the USA. Our results demonstrate robust production and proper processing of EVD68 capsid proteins upon co-expression with the viral protease 3CD. Intranasally-immunized animals effectively seroconverted to NDV antigens, indicating successful replication of the vectors. Antibodies that could bind both the Fermon and Ohio-2018 virions were observed in the sera of mice immunized with either viral vector. At least some animals also demonstrated a strong respiratory mucosal IgA response against EVD68 capsid proteins. These data confirm the immunogenicity of EVD68 proteins expressed from a viral vector in the respiratory tract. Yet neither humoral nor mucosal antibodies were protective against EVD68 infection in cell culture. Analysis of cells infected with recombinant NDVs by electron microscopy indicated structural differences between bona fide EVD68 virions and VLPs, suggesting that the lack of neutralizing antibody response is likely due to antigenic disparity between the EVD68 virions and empty VLPs and/or limited stability of VLPs within the murine respiratory tract.

We used DNA methylation from ONT WGS to detect changes in the tumour epigenomes compared to adjacent normal tissue. We employed established pipelines for the identification of somatic alterations to assess the concordance of SNV, short indel, copy number and structural variation from the short-read and long-read tumour genome data. Overall, 69.4% and 30.1% SNVs were concordant between technologies in the pre- and post-treatment tumours, respectively.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) circulate systemically and may carry molecular signals from injured organs, but the correspondence between EV cargo and lung tissue alterations remains unclear. Methods: We established aspiration-, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, and COVID-19-induced murine ARDS models and applied a tissue-guided multiomics framework integrating proteomic and metabolomic analyses of lung tissue and plasma-derived EVs to identify lung-originating circulating biomarkers. Results: Four proteins-haptoglobin (HP), inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chains 3 and 4 (ITIH3, ITIH4), and clusterin (CLU)-were consistently upregulated in both lung tissue and plasma EVs across all ARDS etiologies. Metabolomic integration revealed dysregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism as a unifying inflammatory axis. Multiomics network analysis further distinguished etiology-specific molecular programs, including glycolytic activation in aspiration-induced, platelet aggregation in LPS-induced, and vascular smooth muscle dysregulation in COVID-19-induced ARDS.

We introduce screening strategies such as Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) and Fluorescence Polarization (FP), alongside both solution-based and immobilization-based biophysical techniques, including Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) for reliable affinity determination. To assess intracellular interactions with full-length target proteins, we also employ Nano Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (NanoBRET). Together, these methods establish a robust framework for the discovery and characterization of degron-based peptidomimetic compounds.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Genotypic DRT is challenging to interpret because of the growing list of mutations responsible for HIV drug resistance. Although phenotypic DRT is simpler to interpret, it requires slow and labor-intensive viral culture. Phenotypic tests that measure the activity of isolated HIV enzymes are faster and less labor-intensive, but none have yet met the 2023 WHO Target Product Profile (TPP) for HIV DRT. Here we present an optimized Product-Enhanced Reverse Transcriptase (PERT) assay for sensitive and quantitative detection of HIV viral load and drug resistance. PERT combines complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis by HIV-Reverse Transcriptase (HIV-RT) with cDNA amplification and detection by quantitative PCR (qPCR). We established sensitive detection down to 10 copies of wildtype or M184V HIV-RT, corresponding to a viral load of ~250 copies HIV RNA/mL. We demonstrated the assay's feasibility for phenotypic DRT using the HIV drug lamivudine-5'-triphosphate (3TC-TP) -- to which the M184V mutation confers high-level resistance -- and quantified inhibition by 3TC-TP using the difference in cDNA produced between drug and no-drug conditions. We met the WHO minimal analytical sensitivity requirements (same as Sanger sequencing) for detection of low-abundance drug resistant variants by differentiating 20% M184V HIV-RT fractions in heterogenous mixtures based on a 42.6% decrease in inhibition compared to wildtype samples (1000 total copies, incubated with 500 M 3TC-TP).", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Although substrate stiffness is known to influence MSC fate through mechanotransduction, the epigenetic mechanisms linking mechanical stress to progressive phenotypic drift remain poorly defined. A mechano-epigenetic pathway is identified in this work, centered on the histone methyltransferase EZH2 - that governs chromatin remodeling and loss of stemness during serial passaging. Multi-omics, high-resolution imaging, and functional assays show that MSCs expanded on mechanically stiff TCP accumulate H3K27me3 repressive chromatin mark, lose SWI/SNF -ARID1A chromatin-remodeling foci, and exhibit an altered chromatin accessibility profile. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 with GSK343 selectively reduced H3K27me3, restored ARID1A-containing SWI/SNF organization, and preserved MSC morphology and expression of canonical stemness markers (CD73, CD90, CD105) even at later passage. ATAC-seq analysis revealed that GSK343 rebalanced chromatin accessibility, reopening TEAD/YAP-responsive regulatory regions while repressing accessibility at lineage-priming and senescence-associated sites. RNA-seq demonstrated that GSK343 maintained transcriptional programs associated with immunomodulation, migration, and trophic signaling, while suppressing hyperproliferative and senescence-associated genes that are characteristic of late-passage MSCs. Proteomic profiling of MSC secretomes further showed that GSK343 attenuated pro-fibrotic ECM factors and senescence-linked proteins while enhancing angiogenic and reparative mediators. Functionally, conditioned media from GSK343-treated MSCs significantly increased primary chondrocyte proliferation, demonstrating preserved therapeutic potency. Together, these findings establish EZH2 as a central mediator of stiffness-induced epigenetic drift in human MSCs and demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition can maintain the stemness without compromising their expansion ability. This work provides a foundational strategy for mechano-epigenetic engineering of MSCs and highlights EZH2 inhibition as a scalable, manufacturing-compatible approach to preserve potency for regenerative medicine applications.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

While isoform identification has received significant attention, the handling of biologically replicated lrRNA-seq datasets remains less explored. However, how multiple samples are combined in a lrRNA-seq study may strongly impact transcript identification. This study defines and evaluates two strategies for obtaining consensus transcriptomes from multi-sample lrRNA-seq data: \"Join & Call\", where reads from all samples are combined before transcript identification, and \"Call & Join\", where transcript identification is performed on individual samples before combining the resulting annotations. We applied these strategies to a highly replicated dataset of mouse brain and kidney tissues, using both PacBio and ONT technologies, across six widely used transcript reconstruction tools. Our results indicate that the optimal strategy depends on the chosen computational tool and research objective. We found that Join & Call is generally more suitable for discovering rarely occurring, novel isoforms, as pooling evidence increases confidence in calling lowly-expressed transcripts. Conversely, Call & Join is computationally more efficient and often preferable for highly replicated datasets when the investigation of rare novel transcripts is not the primary objective. Our findings provide a conceptual and practical framework for multi-sample transcriptome reconstruction, guiding best practices in the context of increasingly large-scale lrRNA-seq studies.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

While covalent inhibitors have shown preclinical promise, non-covalent inhibitors offer potential advantages in terms of selectivity and reduced off-target effects. However, structural and mechanistic data for non-covalent UBE2N inhibitors remain scarce. To address this gap, we implemented a dual in silico strategy combining structure-based molecular docking and ligand-based 3D pharmacophore modelling. Screening a home library of ~19,000 compounds targeting both the ubiquitin-binding and cofactor interfaces of UBE2N, we identified 22 candidates suitable for biological evaluation. Among these, two compounds, CERMN-2 and CERMN-16, emerged as promising non-covalent inhibitors. CERMN-16, structurally related to the natural compound Variabine B (identified through 3D pharmacophore screening), significantly reduced SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell viability and enhanced their sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. CERMN-2, identified through docking, also demonstrated a synergistic effect with Olaparib and showed low toxicity in normal ovarian epithelial cells. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated distinct binding modes for each compound, consistent with their targeted binding sites. Biophysical experiments revealed weak binding of CERMN-16 to UBE2N, whereas CERMN-2 bound UBE2N in two orthogonal assays (Microscale thermophoresis and Nano differential scanning fluorimetry). CERMN-16, and more importantly CERMN-2, therefore represent promising leads for the development of selective, non-natural, non-covalent UBE2N inhibitors.

Individuals interested in research studies may want to contribute through patient partner engagement or sample donation but find the relevant literature overwhelming. Through the generation of lay summaries, previously inaccessible research papers become easier to comprehend, especially for patient partners or data donors. With large language models (LLMs) continuing to advance, so does their capability to summarize large texts. Objectives: In this study, we examined whether LLMs can produce lay summaries of scientific literature at-scale, while maintaining readability and accuracy to their source texts. Methods: We developed a tool to generate lay summaries of open-access article abstracts and their full texts with GPT-4-Turbo. Prompt development aimed for a target 8th grade reading level assessed with Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. Human-review metrics were used to evaluate readability and accuracy when generated using abstracts versus full text articles. Results: The average Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Score was 7.13 for abstract-based summaries and 7.39 for full text-based summaries, indicating summaries at around 7th grade reading level. Human-review metrics showed these summaries were of similar readability and accuracy when generated using abstracts versus full text articles, with mean accuracy scores from human review of 7.09 vs 7.42 out of 10 respectively. Additionally, qualitative patient-based assessment indicated these summaries would encourage participation in research studies. Conclusion: By generating lay summaries for complex and lengthy research papers, their scientific information becomes accessible to a larger audience, including patient partners interested in contributing to cancer research. Summaries that are easy to understand will allow participants to make informed decisions about their involvement and appreciate the impact of their contributions if and when their results are published.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Controlling these dynamics typically involves circuits consisting of multiple genes and transcription factors (TFs). Here, we discover a new class of bifunctional transcriptional effector domains that can first activate and subsequently repress the same gene, producing dynamic gene expression pulses from a single input. These pulse dynamics arise from distinct, temporally separated chromatin states defined by active and repressive chromatin modifications. The balance between active and repressed states is determined by the DNA occupancy of the bifunctional TF. Bifunctional domains activate at low occupancy but switch to repression at high occupancy, resulting in a non-monotonic TF input-gene expression output relationship tunable by TF concentration and number of DNA binding sites. We develop a kinetic model that links TF occupancy to gene expression transitions, allowing for the programming of eight distinct cell \"states\" - combinations of On/Off states of 3 reporter genes - using a single bifunctional effector. This work establishes the theoretical framework and molecular mechanisms of pulse-generating gene regulation by bifunctional domains and creates a foundation for engineering complex multi-gene circuits.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we report that serotonergic neurons promote the proliferation of high-grade gliomas throughout the brain. Serotonergic neuronal activity drives circuit-specific increases in high-grade glioma proliferation, calcium transients, and reduced survival. This growth-promoting effect is chiefly mediated by activation of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) receptor 5HT2A on glioma cells. Knock out or pharmacological blockade of 5HT2A receptors in glioma abrogated the glioma growth-promoting effects of serotonergic neuronal activity, while serotonergic psychedelic drugs robustly promote malignant cell proliferation.

Trans-acting genetic variation coordinates genome-wide chromatin changes, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain unclear. Here, we use the power of mouse genetics to investigate how genetic variation at trans-acting loci regulates 3D chromatin interactions. Results Using HiChIP to map H3K27ac-associated regulatory elements in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we identified 4,962 strain-differential interactions, 71% of which overlapped chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (QTL), establishing chromatin interaction variation is predominantly heritable. These differential interactions showed coordinated changes in chromatin state and gene expression, with stronger interactions associated with increased accessibility and transcription. Notably, loci regulated in trans exhibited a unique chromatin signature where weaker interactions were enriched for H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. Analysis of F1 hybrids revealed dominant repressive effects, consistent with heterochromatin-mediated trans-regulation. To causally test this mechanism, we generated reciprocal congenic mouse strains carrying a Chr13 trans-QTL region. Integrated multiomic profiling of congenic ESC lines demonstrated that this single locus coordinates changes in H3K9me3, H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and 3D contact frequency at hundreds of distal targets. Consistent with our expectations, 73-83% of differential interactions at Chr13 trans-QTL targets changed in the predicted direction, demonstrating that heterochromatin-mediated trans-regulation coordinately regulates hundreds of regulatory loci. Conclusions This work establishes heterochromatin formation as a mechanism by which genetic variation at trans-acting loci coordinates changes across chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and 3D genome organization, providing a framework for understanding how early developmental chromatin states could generate phenotypic variation while preserving essential developmental programs.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

The mouse neonatal anemia (Nan) mutation is driven by a semi-dominant mutation in one allele of the EKLF second Zn-finger at position E339D. RNA-seq analysis of Nan/+ erythroid cells showed that expression of numerous enzymes associated with metabolic pathways are changed as a result. We assessed and analyzed the effects of this dysregulation by mass spectrometry of embryonic and adult material. Our results show that mono-allelic expression of Nan-EKLF has profound impacts on erythroid cell metabolism: levels of amino acids, nucleotides, and metabolites are altered, more energy is needed for survival and proliferation, and glucose is taken up more rapidly. As a result, mitochondrial morphology is distorted, leading to VDAC1 oligomerization and mtDNA release to the cytosol. This activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and induces a type-I IFN response that drives inflammation. Use of STING or VDAC inhibitors alleviates these conditions both ex vivo and in vivo. Mechanistically, treatment restores normal erythroid cell divisions and differentiation, and decreases inflammatory pathways in the bone marrow.

The histone variant macroH2A has classically viewed as an epigenetic barrier stabilizing somatic identity and restricting pluripotency gene activation. Here, we show that during reprogramming, macroH2A1 nucleosomes undergo functional repurposing. Early in the process, mH2A1 nucleosomes act as a barrier to cellular plasticity, but later facilitate the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency by reshaping the epigenetic landscape. High-resolution chromatin profiling reveals that mH2A1.2 nucleosomes undergo rapid, large-scale repositioning, dissociating from promoters and reassembling ~30 bp away, frequently near NRF-1 binding sites. This repositioning occludes E2F4 binding, relieving cell-cycle arrest thereby enabling reprogramming. Likewise, mH2A1.1 nucleosomes display extensive mobility that culminates in deposition at pluripotency genes in ESCs, where they sustain their expression by assembling promoter transcriptional hubs. In this later role, mH2A1.1 functions as a chromatin bookmark stabilizing the Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4 network.

We show that our method finds optimal medium formulations along a Pareto front balancing growth, production and cost of medium components. We illustrate the approach in models of Escherichia coli engineered to produce antibody fragments, as well as Bacillus subtilis strains that synthesize cyclic lipopeptides. Our results show that gsMOBO identifies media compositions and Pareto-optimal trade-offs consistent with prior experimental work. Our method provides a broadly applicable tool for the design of cost-effective and productive culture media, and offers a route to accelerate medium development in biomanufacturing.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Although two-photon microscopy is widely used in brain research, its imaging speed is insufficient for high-throughput voltage recordings. To overcome this limitation, we developed an all-optical beam multiplexing engine via retroreflection from two near-parallel mirrors. This approach integrates seamlessly with standard two-photon microscopes, enabling kilohertz-frame-rate imaging across a 16-fold expanded field of view while maintaining synaptic resolution. Operating at over 220 megapixels per second, it enables submillisecond imaging of dendritic propagation of action potentials and simultaneous voltage recording from more than 200 hippocampal neurons in head-fixed, behaving mice.

R.", "abstract": "Infants are significantly more susceptible to respiratory infection, often resulting in increased morbidity and hospitalization, and occasionally death. This susceptibility is partially explained by the developing nature of the thymus in human infants at, and for several months after, birth. However, the contribution of T cells produced in this thymic microenvironment to infant immune responses has received minimal investigation. Here, we utilized a previously described mouse model (Foxn1{triangleup}/{triangleup}) which exhibits a persistently immature thymus. Through further characterization, we have determined that adult Foxn1{triangleup}/{triangleup} mice retain some unique T cells observed in neonatal mice including CD8{beta}+ {gamma}{delta} T cells and CD8 T cells displaying a memory-like phenotype. For this reason, we assessed the potential of these neonatal-like T responses to two pathogens which disproportionately affect neonates, Bordetella pertussis (Bp) and influenza. Utilizing these infections, we demonstrate that T cells generated in an incompletely developed thymus fail to control or mount an effective response against Bp. We also observe that Foxn1{triangleup}/{triangleup} mice control acute influenza infection, a response which does not require IL-17. However, the Foxn1{triangleup}/{triangleup} mice fail to generate an influenza nucleoprotein (NP) specific CD8+ T cell response which is likely associated with their inability to fully clear the infection. Together, these data suggest that Foxn1{triangleup}/{triangleup} mice can be utilized to study the generation, function, and persistence of some unique T cells made in a neonatal-like thymus.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "T-cell activation is driven by the recruitment of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) to the T-cell receptor (TCR), a critical step in initiating immune responses. Existing LCK inhibitors lack specificity because they target the conserved kinase domain shared by Src family kinases, resulting in off-target effects. Here, we introduce a novel strategy to selectively modulate T-cell activation by disrupting the interaction between the SH3 domain of LCK and the receptor kinase (RK) motif of CD3{varepsilon}. Using computational modeling and high-throughput virtual screening, we identified candidate compounds targeting the SH3(LCK) domain. Functional validation revealed that one compound, C10, selectively disrupted the SH3-RK interaction, leading to reduced TCR-driven activation and proliferation, while sparing activation via alternative receptors and B-cell responses. Moreover, C10 modulated the activity of CD3{varepsilon}-containing CAR and TRuC T cells, attenuating cytokine production and promoting a central-memory-like phenotype associated with enhanced persistence. These findings establish targeted disruption of LCK recruitment as a viable strategy for fine-tuning T-cell responses and propose SH3(LCK) as a druggable domain with therapeutic potential for autoimmune diseases, graft-versus-host disease, and optimizing CAR T-cell therapies.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Conventional culture-based diagnostics remain too time-consuming to guide early therapeutic interventions. Here, we present a graphene field-effect transistor (gFET) aptasensor platform enabling rapid, label-free and highly sensitive quantification of all six ESKAPE pathogens. Each gFET device was functionalized with a specific DNA aptamer selected from literature sources and immobilized via a mixed pyrene-based linker strategy on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Exposure of the functionalized sensors to logarithmically diluted bacterial suspensions (10-105 CFU mL-1) produced characteristic and concentration-dependent shifts in source-drain current ({Delta}IDS). For all pathogen-specific aptamers, {Delta}IDS correlated linearly with bacterial load (R2 = 0.90-1.00), while non-target bacteria generated only low-level, unspecific fluctuations. Limits of detection ranged from 10 to 1000 bacterial cells depending on the aptamer.

However, the factors maintaining antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in wildlife microbiomes remain unclear particularly in species inhabiting human-dominated landscapes. We analysed 875 gut metagenomes from wild house mice (Mus musculus) on German farms between 2016 and 2022 to identify environmental and host determinants of ARG occurrence. Using joint species distribution models, we quantified the influence of landscape, climate and mouse associated characteristics on the occurrence of individual ARGs and on trait dependence among genes. Environmental variables and livestock farming intensity explained more than 21% of ARG variation, whereas host characteristics accounted for less than 10%. Analysis of ARG traits revealed that agricultural land use and exposure to livestock increased the occurrence of mobile ARGs. Pig density was strongly associated with integron-encoded sulfonamide resistance genes and genes conferring tetracycline and beta-lactam resistance. Consistent with these findings, mouse resistomes closely resembled those of livestock manure. Taken together, our results show that landscape conditions, particularly farming intensity, shape the distribution of specific ARGs and mobile ARGs in house mice microbiomes. Understanding the factors impacting ARGs prevalence in wildlife is crucial for determining transmission of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms from animal and environmental reservoirs.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

The association between subclinical placental viral infections and spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) is poorly understood. Hence, we examined fresh placenta samples from women in the UK, Bangladesh, and South Africa to elucidate the virome profiles and association with spontaneous PTB. We employed shotgun metagenomics, real-time PCR, and Gram staining, complemented by bioinformatics, to detect both viruses and bacteria in the decidua and chorionic villous tissues. We did not identify any known pathogenic viruses in 236 placental samples, except for one preterm placenta from the Bangladeshi cohort, where human herpesvirus 6 was detected. The majority of the viruses were bacteriophages present at very low abundance and low frequencies across the three cohorts. Lambdavirus lambda was detected in 14% of UK and 11% of Bangladeshi samples but was absent in South African samples. Papiine betaherpesvirus 3 was identified in 62.5% of South African placentas. Punavirus (29.1%) and Streptococcus phages (16.67%) were also prevalent in South African samples. A variety of bacterial species including Moraxella osloensis, Delftia lacustris, Cutibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were detected in samples across the three cohorts in variable frequencies but without any notable tissue immune responses. None of the viruses or bacteria exhibited associations with PTB, except D. lacustris, which was significantly more abundant in preterm compared to term placentas in the Bangladeshi cohort.

Currently, several JN.1 subvariants including XEC, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1 and XFG are circulating worldwide. Additionally, recent studies show that BA.3.2, a descendant of Omicron BA.3, exhibits profound immune evasion potential. On December 5, 2025, BA.3.2, was designated a variant under monitoring by the WHO. To prevent COVID-19, several countries including Japan have continuously developed and approved variant-adapted vaccines: e.g., ancestral/BA.5 bivalent vaccine in 20223, XBB.1.5-based monovalent vaccine in 20234, JN.1-based monovalent vaccine in 2024, and LP.8.1-based monovalent vaccine in 2025. Since XEC was more prevalent than LP.8.1 at the beginning of 2025 in Japan, two Japanese pharmaceutical companies, Daiichi Sankyo and Meiji Seika Pharma, have produced XEC-based vaccines. Here, we investigated the antiviral immunity induced by XEC-based monovalent vaccines against recently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as BA.3.2, in the Japanese population. To assess the neutralizing antibody response induced by XEC-based vaccines, we obtained sera from individuals who had been vaccinated with the XEC-based mRNA monovalent vaccine produced by Daiichi Sankyo (N=22) or the XEC-based self-amplifying replicon vaccine produced by Meiji Seika Pharma (N=20). We collected sera before and 3-4 weeks after vaccination and then performed a neutralization assay using these sera with lentivirus-based pseudoviruses harboring spike proteins of B.1.1, BA.5, XBB.1.5, JN.1, XEC, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1, XFG and BA.3.2. The 50% neutralization titers of the sera against all variants tested were significantly increased in after vaccination in both Daiichi Sankyo cohort (2.1-fold to 11.9-fold, P<0.0001) and Meiji Seika Pharma cohort (1.4-fold to 3.9-fold, P<0.0005). Consistent with our recent study using the sera from LP.8.1-based vaccinees, the humoral immunity induced by XEC-based vaccines against JN.1 and its subvariants (XEC, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1 and XFG) was greater than that against other variants (B.1.1, BA.5, XBB.1.5 and BA.3.2). Notably, our result showed that the XEC-based mRNA vaccine induces a stronger humoral immunity compared to the XEC-based replicon vaccine, and even the LP.8.1-adapted vaccines. However, it should be noted that our cohorts are relatively small and may include confounding factors that affect the results, such as age, sex, history of natural infection and vaccination status. Future investigations with larger cohorts are required to better understand this possibility. To compare the immune status induced by XEC- and LP.8.1-based vaccines, we analyzed the cross-neutralization induced by these vaccines using antigenic cartography. The antigenic map was depicted based on the 50% neutralization titers values obtained from this study and our recent study using LP.8.1-based vaccine sera. The cartography showed that the immune status induced by XEC-based vaccines was similar to that induced by LP.8.1-based vaccines against the nine SARS-CoV-2 variant antigens tested. In sum, our investigations, including the recent one8, suggest that all 4 of the JN.1 subvariants-based vaccines that we tested induce profound humoral immunity against a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 variants.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Our study seeks to identify novel protein-protein interactions to further elucidate their unknown regulatory mechanisms and cellular roles. Using Streptococcus mutans as a model, we engineered a Flag-tagged strain (DacA-FLAG) and then performed co-immunoprecipitation under non-crosslinked and crosslinked conditions followed by mass spectrometry. We identified 22 candidates interacting proteins in non-crosslinked samples, 18 in crosslinked samples, and 6 shared between conditions. Selected partners were validated in vivo using split luciferase complementation. Notably, SMU_723 emerged as a key binding partner. AlphaFold-guided modeling predicated a direct DacA and SMU_723 interaction interface involving threonine 147, glutamine 148, and threonine 149 in DacA . Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues impaired binding, confirming their critical role. An SMU_723 deletion phenocopied a dacA deletion strain, sharing prolonged lag phase, aberrant cell morphology, reduced acid production and acid tolerance, impaired sorbitol metabolism, decreased colonization in a Drosophila model, and delayed growth upon calcium stimulation. These shared phenotypes suggest a functional and possibly regulatory link between DacA and SMU_723.

Native nucleosomes resolved at 5.6 Angstrom reveal four structural classes, from compact conformations at the nuclear periphery to open, flexible forms in the interior, defining a spatially heterogeneous and dynamic chromatin landscape. Within this environment, HIV-1 cores decorated with nuclear factors exclude nearby nucleosomes and preferentially associate with open chromatin.

Understanding critical components of habitat use, such as dietary preferences, is crucial for creating and implementing effective conservation plans. This becomes challenging when species exhibit cryptic behaviours, such as arboreality and nocturnality, as seen in the endangered greater glider (Petauroides spp). Existing methods for determining greater glider diet are inadequate, time consuming and prone to human error. Furthermore, current literature lacks specificity, with most research stating simply that greater gliders are dietary eucalypt specialists, without providing additional insight into which species are eaten. 2. Here, we tested a non-invasive technique using targeted sequencing of species-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms from greater glider faecal samples to identify dietary components across multiple locations in Southeast Queensland. 3. Sequencing identified 17 plant species present in the faecal samples, including Angophora, Acacia and Casuarina spp. that were previously unknown to be feed tree taxa, profoundly increasing our understanding of the habitat requirements of this endangered marsupial. Four of these identified species were out of range of their natural occurrence, suggesting limitations to the accuracy of this technique. 4. This study demonstrates the value of using genomic sequencing for analysing diets of arboreal mammals and makes recommendations for improving the accuracy of this methodology for future studies.

It is an abundant cytoplasmic protein that undergoes stress-induced processing and is then transported to the nucleus. Previous research from our lab has shown that Def1 interacts with various proteins involved in mRNA decay and translation control, and that it regulates mRNA half-lives, suggesting an important role in the cytoplasm. In this study, we report that Def1 binds polyribosomes and that its null mutant strain exhibits phenotypes indicating a role in translation. Ribo-seq analysis revealed that deleting DEF1 altered ribosome footprints on mRNAs and increased the dwell time of ribosomes at non-optimal codons in the A-site. Additionally, results from a codon-optimality reporter assay suggest that Def1 facilitates the degradation of mRNAs containing non-optimal codons. The Ccr4-Not complex links codon optimality to mRNA decay, and Def1's binding to ribosomes depends on its ubiquitin-binding domain, as well as the ubiquitylation of eS7a in the small ribosomal subunit by the Ccr4-Not complex. Moreover, the polyglutamine-rich, unstructured C-terminus of Def1 is crucial for its interaction with RNA decay and translation factors. This indicates that Def1 functions as a ubiquitin-dependent scaffold, connecting translation status to mRNA decay. In summary, we have identified a cytoplasmic function for Def1 in translation and established it as a regulator of gene expression, spanning both transcription and translation processes.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

However, the complex structural features of EF are difficult to capture using conventional histology. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms governing EF homeostasis during fibrosis remain poorly understood. METHODS: A high-dimensional Elastic Fiber Algorithm (EFA) was developed to digitally quantify EF structural features in PF. Gene variation-rate analysis was performed to identify candidate regulators of EF homeostasis. Fibroblast-specific and pathological fibroblast-specific MFAP5 knockout mice were generated to assess the role of MFAP5 in PF rodent models. Bulk RNA sequencing was employed to investigate MFAP5-mediated fibroblast activation and signaling pathways. RESULTS: EFA revealed profound EF disorganization in fibrotic lungs, capturing various architectural alterations. Gene variation-rate analysis identified MFAP5 as a candidate regulator of EF homeostasis, with upregulated expression in PF patients and mouse models. Fibroblast-specific deletion of MFAP5 significantly attenuated fibrosis, restored EF architecture, reduced collagen deposition, and improved pulmonary function in PF mouse models. MFAP5-positive fibroblasts displayed a dynamic shift toward pathological states during PF progression. Mechanistically, MFAP5 promoted fibroblast activation and ECM production via v{beta}3 integrin-mediated TGF{beta} signaling.

Crystal structures of the Fab fragment in complex with PGE2, PGE1, and ONO5 were determined at 1.9 [A], 1.7 [A], and 1.7 [A] resolution, respectively, and the antigen-free Fab structure was solved at 2.0 [A]. The Fab accommodates the L-shaped PG scaffold within a deep antigen-binding crevasse formed between the {beta}-sheet frameworks of the VH and VL domains, where ligand recognition is mediated by multiple water-bridged hydrogen bonds and extensive hydrophobic contacts, including putative CH-O and CH-{pi} interactions. Comparison of antigen-free and ligand-bound structures revealed compensatory conformational rearrangements accompanied by reorganization of bound water networks. Upon PG binding, a short 310 helix forms at the tip of CDR-H1, stabilized by a cluster of hydrogen bonds and capping water molecules. This helix formation is associated with rotation of the VL domain and an increased Fab elbow angle. The CDR-H1 loop undergoes a flip-in transition in which Phe29H inserts into a hydrophobic cavity while Glu31H is extruded toward solvent, accompanied by {pi}-{pi} stacking between Tyr27H and Tyr32H. These changes collectively reduce hydrophobic surface area and promote enthalpy-driven ligand binding. The flexible -chain of PGE1, lacking the C5-C6 double bond, adopts altered conformations that disrupt C1-carboxyl interactions with three aromatic residues and lead to closure of a secondary water channel, consistent with subtle but meaningful differences in binding thermodynamics and crystallographic temperature factors relative to PGE2 and ONO5. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed high-affinity, enthalpy-driven PG binding to the Fab, in agreement with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which showed increased thermal stability upon complex formation. Under macromolecular crowding conditions induced by high bovine serum albumin (BSA) concentrations, PG binding to the intact mAb--but not to the Fab--exhibited improved discrimination between PGE2 and PGE1, suggesting that reduced entropy-enthalpy compensation under crowding amplifies subtle structural mismatches in ligand binding.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

AB8939 disrupts the microtubule network, leading to mitotic arrest in G2/M phase and subsequent apoptosis. Importantly, AB8939 overcomes drug resistance mechanisms, including overexpression of efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and aberrant expression of {beta}3-tubulin. AB8939 displays high cytotoxicity against blasts from AML patients, including blasts resistant to cytarabine (Ara-C). In vivo, AB8939 shows strong antitumor activity in MOLM-14, an Ara-C-resistant AML model, as evidenced by tumor growth inhibition and substantial increase in mouse survival. Further experiments performed on an AML PDX TG-AML-36 model demonstrated that AB8939 efficiently kills leukemic stem cells (CD34+/CD38-). Reverse proteomic experiments revealed that AB8939 inhibits ALDH1 and ALDH2, enzymes often overexpressed in tumors and tumor stem cells, thereby favoring tumor progression and relapse. AB8939 is a novel dual-targeting drug that acts on both tubulin and ALDH enzymes, with potential activity against various cancer types, especially refractory AML with complex karyotypes such as those displaying MECOM rearrangement and AML with mutations associated with poor prognosis, such as ASXL1 and TP53.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

While the role of these genes in the early specification of organ identity is well established, their late function throughout floral organ development and in specific cell types is much less characterized. In particular, since plant organs are structured in clonally-independent cell layers, whether and how homeotic identity interacts with cell layer identity is unknown. We have previously identified cell layer-specific mutants for the petal identity gene PhDEF, resulting in drastically different petal phenotypes whether PhDEF is expressed in the petal epidermis or in the mesophyll. In this study, using a combination of single-cell RNA-Seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation on phdef cell layer-specific mutants, we find that PhDEF regulates a different set of target genes in the petal epidermis and mesophyll, and that most of its regulatory action takes place in the epidermis, although PhDEF is expressed evenly in the two petal cell layers. We uncover a high diversity of binding profiles in PhDEF target genes, with a complex combination of layer-specific or -aspecific binding sites driving their expression. Strikingly, binding profiles are not correlated with expression profiles in either cell layer. Our study highlights that floral homeotic genes like PhDEF can have different regulatory actions in different cell contexts, here different cell layers, and that cell layer identity indeed influences the regulatory processes underlying homeotic identity.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

This variability is dependent on a number of factors, including the location of the site under study, the indicators and taxa utilised in the analysis. In this study, a multi-metric and multi-contextual approach was applied to analyse 62 river restoration projects located in France, Germany and the Netherlands. This methodological approach facilitated the characterisation of the responses exhibited by macroinvertebrate communities in response to restoration initiatives, and the subsequent identification of the environmental contexts and the categories of restoration measures that exerted influence on these responses. Utilising log-response ratios based on both taxonomic and functional ecological metrics, a k-means clustering analysis was performed. This analysis yielded two distinct groups of sites: the first exhibiting predominantly positive responses to restoration, and the second demonstrating neutral or marginally negative responses. Positive responses have been shown to be associated with ambitious restoration projects, which are characterised by measures targeting regional-scale processes. These measures include the implementation of projects designed to improve river longitudinal continuity in degraded catchment areas, where the density of obstacles and the intensity of agricultural use are particularly high. Conversely, restoration initiatives targeting local-scale issues within more natural contexts or at high altitude exhibited minimal to no ecological response. This study emphasises the significance of an integrated approach that incorporates various facets (taxonomic and functional) of biodiversity, along with a meticulous examination of the environmental context and project construction, to enhance the evaluation of the ecological benefits of river restoration. The findings of this study may also be applicable in the context of fieldwork, providing practitioners with a framework to inform the design of restoration projects.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

In healthy joints, the synovial lining is essential for joint homeostasis, forming a selective barrier and secreting lubricating molecules, yet the mechanisms that restores homeostatic synovial lining during RA remission remains poorly understood. Here, we applied spatial transcriptomics to examine biopsies of RA patients in remission to identify a mechanism that orchestrates a phenotypic switch specifying synovial quiescent lining fibroblast differentiation. Spatial transcriptomics revealed a proximity-sensing program where at low cell density, fibroblasts adopt proliferative and fibrotic transcriptional state characterized by expression of MKI67, COL1A2 and COL6A2, whereas at high cell-density, fibroblasts induce a quiescent lining fibroblast transcriptional program characterized by PRG4, CLU and PDPN. Mechanistically, fibroblasts sense spatial proximity through HBEGF EGFR signaling, which leads to phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB5. Perturbation of the EGFR CREB5 axis abolishes fibroblast proximity-sensing and blocks synovial lining fibroblast differentiation. Conversely, EGFR activation by the ligand HBEGF or pharmacologic activation of CREB5 is sufficient to induce synovial lining fibroblast differentiation. Together, our findings define a novel spatial proximity-sensing pathway underlying a return to homoeostatic fibroblast function during RA remission. By sensing their spatial proximity to neighboring fibroblasts, synovial fibroblasts translate these positional cues into signals that lead to restoration of a normal, steady-state synovial lining membrane.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Recognizing the significant economic losses in corn yields due to frost damage, we hypothesized that northern populations of T. dactyloides are enriched for freezing tolerance alleles. 40 diverse Tripsacum accessions were collected from natural populations and long-established field collections and used to generate F1 hybrids and open-pollinated F2 families. F2 seedlings were germinated then screened within a growth chamber for freezing tolerance by exposure to freezing temperatures. Seedlings were then phenotyped by tissue survival, and extremes were pooled to create tolerant and susceptible bulks. DNA sequencing was performed on founders, F1s, and tolerant/susceptible F2 bulks. To overcome challenges in traditional SNP calling in bulked samples, we developed a regression-based approach to estimate gamete frequencies and impute allele frequencies in pooled populations. The results showed genetic diversity among Tripsacum accessions, with divergence between northern and southern populations. We tracked segregation of alleles across genomic loci, and performed a joint bulk segregant analysis, identifying 25 QTLs significantly associated with freezing tolerance.

While the process for depolymerization of acetylated {beta}-mannans has been described in depth for members of the phylum Bacillota, there is limited mechanistic knowledge on how Bacteroidota utilize these glycans. Here, we combined proteomics and biochemical analyses to functionally characterize a pair of carbohydrate esterases (CEs) from Bacteroides cellulosilyticus that, together, deacetylate complex {beta}-mannans. We demonstrate that the newly identified BcCExxx enzyme, representing a novel carbohydrate esterase (CE) family, exhibits high specificity by selectively removing axially oriented 2-O-acetyl groups from mannose residues. In contrast, BcCE7 functions as a broad-spectrum esterase, capable of deacetylating oligosaccharides derived from structurally diverse substrates, including {beta}-mannans, xylans, and acetylated cellulose. In transesterification reactions, BcCExxx showed activity on both mannooligosaccharides and polymeric glucomannan.

Z-NAs are implicated in processes such as neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease, Lupus Erythematosus, microbial biofilms, and type I interferon-mediated human pathologies. Since endogenous Z-NA sensors like the Z domain can induce B-to-Z transitions, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) Z-D11 and Z22 have been regarded as conformation-specific tools to confirm Z-NA in situ, although high-resolution structural information is missing. Here, we employed single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to solve structures of Z-D11 and Z22 bound to synthetic d(CG)6 12mer Z-DNA duplex. Both mAbs form filamentous trimers around the Z-DNA axis, further stabilized by Fab-Fab interactions. The mAbs achieve specificity through extensive contacts to both Z-form backbone strands and the exposed guanine/cytosine bases in the major groove. This mode of recognition is dictated by shape complementarity rather than sequence specificity, sensing the alternating syn/anti backbone torsions and the phosphate zig-zag geometry unique to Z-DNA. Our data also suggest that these mAbs are not inducing B-to-Z transitions under normal physiological conditions. Finally, comparison to other double-stranded NA-binding mAbs defines a similar structural logic adapted to different helical geometry recognition patterns, thus providing a framework for engineering highly specific nucleic acid probes.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

JNJ-55511118 (JNJ-118) is a selective inhibitor of gamma 8-containing AMPARs. The resting-state structure shows JNJ-118 binding near the transmembrane entrance at the AMPAR-gamma 8 interface, producing only localized structural effects. However, the mechanism by which JNJ-118 inhibits agonist-bound receptors remains unclear, as no activated-state structures are available. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescence lifetime imaging, and electrophysiology, we examined how JNJ-118 reshapes AMPAR conformations in the presence and absence of glutamate. JNJ-118 shifts the glutamate-bound gamma 8-containing receptor toward a desensitized-like conformation by destabilizing the ligand-binding domain dimer interface, and this effect is supported by functional evidence showing allosteric competition between cyclothiazide and JNJ-118. Although the dimer interface adopts a configuration similar to that of AMPARs lacking TARPs, fluorescence lifetime measurements confirm that gamma 8 remains associated with the receptor.

This trade-off dictates bacterial resilience and often complicates metabolic engineering efforts. Addressing it requires identifying specific pathways responsible for diverting metabolic resources away from desired production goals. For this purpose, we introduce EMBER (Exploration of Metabolic trade-offs Based on the mapping of Expression patterns to Reactions), a novel Genome-scale Metabolic Model (GEM) contextualization approach. EMBER integrates transcriptomic data and flux analysis to computationally distinguish between growth-associated reactions (BARs) and adaptive, non-biomass reactions (NBRs). We applied this framework to analyze the metabolic architectures of three diverse and biotechnologically relevant organisms--P. putida, E. coli, and Synechocystis--across various environmental conditions. We revealed marked variability in adaptive resource allocation, with the heterotrophs dedicating substantially more active genes to NBRs (up to 31%) than the photoautotroph Synechocystis (17.5%). Functional analysis showed that BARs consistently supported core metabolism, while NBRs encoded context-specific adaptive functions aligned with the native environment of each organism. Analysis of NBR gene expression variability further suggested that P. putida relies predominantly on Bet-Hedging strategies, whereas E. coli employs more regulated Responsive Switching mechanisms. Overall, EMBER offers a powerful systems biology tool to quantify and functionally interpret metabolic heterogeneity.

The causing agent of the deadliest form of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, has abundant prion-like proteins whose aggregation is presumed to have a functional role. Multiple members of the largest family of transcription factors in P. falciparum, AP2 (PfAP2), responsible for adapting the parasite gene response in different scenarios, were found in aggregation-prone protein screenings. Results: We show that the PfAP2s members carry the physicochemical determinants to perform LLPS forming biomolecular condensates in vivo. The long IDRs of PfAP2s could sense changes in the cellular microenvironment, and their PrLDs could drive conformational rearrangements. PfAP2s do not function as centralizing hubs for protein-protein interaction networks, but display significant preferred interactions among themselves, establishing a large, connected subnetwork. Predictions suggest that all PfAP2s have regions to localize into LLPS-condensates, while larger PfAP2s could initiate condensation. We show that four PfAP2 members co-localize in live P. falciparum, bearing the potential to be engaged in LLPS-condensates. Conclusion: We present bioinformatics analyses and experimental data obtained in live parasites suggesting that PfAP2s are able to direct LLPS in P. falciparum. We propose a model in which sensing by the parasite of cellular stresses like host transfer, temperature changes and energy depletion, and the corresponding gene responses are driven by LLPS where the PfAP2 family plays a fundamental role.

Using a filter-based co-culture system that mimics the shared basement membrane of the microcirculation, we performed an integrated multi-omics analysis to investigate how direct contact reprograms both cell types. We found that initial contact does not induce immediate quiescence but rather triggers a transient, low-level activation of an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT)-like state in endothelial cells, characterized by specific upregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix production (e.g., collagen isoforms) and PDGFR signaling, without a full loss of endothelial identity. Concomitantly, pericytes shifted endothelial cell metabolism, increasing glycolysis and elevating intracellular pyruvate and lactate. Proteomic analysis of the contact interface revealed enrichment of solute carriers, most notably the lactate transporter SLC16A3. Functional studies demonstrated that pericytes act as a glycolytic partner, actively shuttling lactate to endothelial cells via SLC16A3. This lactate did not fuel the TCA cycle but instead served as a signaling metabolite, driving widespread alterations in the endothelial acetylome and lactylome, particularly affecting proteins involved in glycolytic metabolism. In vitro, exogenous lactate potentiated cytokine-induced EndMT and upregulated lactylation-associated genes. The physiological relevance of this lactate shuttle was confirmed in vivo, where endothelial-specific deletion of Slc16a3 in mice impaired postnatal retinal angiogenesis, leading to reduced vessel density and diminished endothelial-pericyte overlap without affecting endothelial cell proliferation. Our findings establish that vessel maturation is orchestrated by a metabolically gated phase of plasticity initiated upon first contact, wherein a targeted EndMT-like program and a pericyte-driven lactate signaling axis are integrated to coordinate vascular network assembly.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Our results reveal that Pleistocene so called protodogs show no brain size reduction compared to coeval Pleistocene wolves. Instead, we observed a slightly larger relative endocranial volume in the 35,000-year-old specimen from Goyet, which could suggest increased behavioural flexibility in the presence of humans. This hypothesis needs to be tested further. In contrast, Late Neolithic dogs show a drastic 46% brain size reduction with an endocranial volumes comparable to modern small terrier and toy breeds. The anxious and wary temperaments of these Late Neolithic dogs, induced by the brain tissue reorganization associated with such a size reduction, could have served an alerting purpose, among the many other potential roles dogs could have played within this Late Neolithic socio-ecosystems.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Nonetheless, the precise delivery of mild hyperthermia to the brain remains a significant challenge. To apply mild hyperthermia targeted to the brain and evaluate its impact on cognitive improvement, this study used focused ultrasound (FUS) to administer localized mild hyperthermia to the brains of AD mouse induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of A{beta}25-35. For considerations of safety and therapeutic efficacy, a thermal-cycling hyperthermia (TC-HT) protocol was adapted into a focused ultrasound thermal-cycling stimulation (FUS-TCS), which was compared with the continuous focused ultrasound hyperthermia stimulation (FUS-HTS). The findings revealed that the FUS-TCS treatment group exhibited a significant improvement in cognitive performance, as evidenced by enhanced outcomes in the Y-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Furthermore, this group demonstrated increased expression of A{beta}-degrading enzymes and antioxidant proteins, including heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), neprilysin (NEP), insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2).

These oscillations could arise from circadian clock control of metabolic pathways in peripheral tissues, or secondary to rhythmic food intake, which is primarily controlled by central circadian clocks in the brain. To determine the relative contribution of central and peripheral clocks and behavioral cycles to metabolic rhythms in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we conducted large-scale metabolite profiling with fine temporal resolution across multiple days in control flies with intact molecular clocks and in flies in which we used the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to specifically eliminate molecular circadian clock function in the fat body, a peripheral metabolic tissue, or the brain. As these latter flies lack feeding rhythms due to central circadian clock dysfunction, we also included an experimental cohort of flies lacking central brain clocks but subjected to time-restricted feeding (TRF) protocols to impose feeding rhythms. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing confirmed selective molecular clock elimination following fat body manipulations, which was associated with predicted alterations in clock gene expression and an attenuation of time-of-day differences in the abundance of fat body transcripts involved in key metabolic pathways. Interestingly, we identified few rhythmically expressed metabolites in flies that were allowed ad libitum food access, and rhythms of metabolite abundance were not drastically altered by tissue-specific molecular clock disruption. In contrast, we found that flies lacking brain clocks but raised on TRF exhibited a profound increase in cyclic metabolites. These findings suggest that whole-body metabolic rhythms in Drosophila are more strongly regulated by feeding cycles than by direct circadian clock control of metabolic pathways despite the presence of metabolic genes that exhibit local-clock dependent modulation of expression across the day.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

While AMPK is known to inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), its role in regulating mTORC2 remains enigmatic, with recent evidence suggesting context-dependent activation. Here, we investigated the specific roles of AMPK catalytic isoforms in coordinating mTOR signaling and functional metabolic adaptations in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) during glucose starvation. We found that loss of the major AMPK1 isoform triggers an increase in otherwise minor AMPK2 expression. While both isoforms are activated by glucose starvation and phosphorylate the canonical substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), only AMPK2 is necessary and sufficient for transient activation of the mTORC2 signaling, as monitored by phosphorylation of downstream reporters, Akt and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1). This AMPK2-dependent mTORC2 activation peaked at 30 minutes of starvation and then declined under prolonged starvation stress. Surprisingly, genetic ablation of the AMPK2-mTORC2 axis through knockdown of AMPK2, both AMPK isoforms, or the essential mTORC2 component Rictor failed to attenuate the starvation-induced compensatory increase in glucose uptake. This adaptive response occurred robustly and identically across all genetic backgrounds. Collectively, our findings reveal an isoform-specific signaling module wherein AMPK2 transiently activates mTORC2, but this pathway is functionally uncoupled from the critical adaptive response of glucose uptake, thus uncovering a remarkable resilience in the endothelial metabolic network and indicating that other, parallel pathways are the primary drivers of this essential survival mechanism.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

N.; Pimiento, C.; Pearse, W. D.", "abstract": "Finite resources dictate that conservation biologists must prioritise some species over others. Conservation metrics, such as EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered; EDGE1) and FUSE (Functionally Unique, Specialised and Endangered), make prioritisation based on species' evolutionary or functional distinctiveness, respectively, and degree of threat. EDGE is in part based on the rationale that the evolutionary distinctiveness it captures serves to maximise biodiversity in form and function. However, doubts exist as to whether or not evolutionary distinctiveness truly serves as a proxy for functional distinctiveness, and, therefore, if the prominent use of EDGE lists by conservation practitioners adequately protects functional distinctiveness. To address this, we conducted a direct global comparison of EDGE against FUSE. Unlike EDGE, FUSE directly measures and prioritises functional distinctiveness. Here, we compare EDGE and FUSE scores for two well-studied groups: mammals (n = 5319 species) and birds (n = 7932 species). These groups are central to global conservation and, until now, have not been assessed under FUSE. We find that species rankings under EDGE and FUSE differ significantly, highlighting that these two metrics capture distinct, complementary aspects of biodiversity. This suggests that conservation strategies based solely on EDGE may overlook species with critical functional roles. Rather than assuming alignment between evolutionary and functional distinctiveness, we propose integrating both within a single measure, leveraging the strengths and benefits of each. To this end, we present a new conservation metric - EFUSE (Evolutionarily and Functionally Unique, Specialised, and Endangered) - which incorporates both evolutionary and functional distinctiveness into a single measure. EFUSE ensures that important components of biodiversity, which relate to ecosystem functioning, nature's future contributions to people, and the intrinsic value of species, are adequately maximised in conservation decision-making.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Genomic nanopore sequencing identified a single 23S rRNA mutation (T1732C) confined to one of the six rRNA operons (operon 2), which uniquely contains nine tRNA genes. RNA direct nanopore sequencing generated a comprehensive and updated rRNA modification map for S. aureus and revealed extensive remodeling of rRNA modifications in the resistant strain. Differentially incorporated modifications included pseudouridine, dihydrouridine, and 5-hydroxycytidine at functionally relevant positions within the ribosome.

Therapeutic targeting requires precise temporal control rather than complete inhibition. This study identifies the matricellular protein SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1) as a novel regulator of EndMT. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from post-MI mouse hearts revealed that SMOC1 is highly enriched in a subpopulation of endothelial cells undergoing late EndMT. In vitro, SMOC1 expression was upregulated during cytokine-induced EndMT in human endothelial cells. Its siRNA-mediated knockdown exacerbated the EndMT phenotype, increasing mesenchymal marker expression and cell morphology changes, effects rescued by recombinant SMOC1 (rSMOC1). Mechanistically, SMOC1 deficiency enhanced TGF-{beta}2-induced SMAD2 phosphorylation, while rSMOC1 attenuated this pathway and promoted a shift from the short to the long, signaling-competent isoform of endoglin. In vivo, endothelial-specific SMOC1 deficiency (SMOC1{Delta}EC) in mice promoted age-associated EndMT and profoundly worsened post-MI outcomes. After MI, SMOC1{Delta}EC mice exhibited exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, ventricular dilation, pathological fibrosis, increased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced survival, and a higher incidence of cardiac rupture compared to controls. Collectively, these findings establish SMOC1 as a critical endogenous modulator of EndMT that restrains its pathological progression. SMOC1 coordinates endothelial cell phenotype, in part by fine-tuning TGF-{beta}/endoglin signaling, and its loss accelerates maladaptive remodeling post-MI. Thus, SMOC1 represents a potential therapeutic target for spatially and temporally controlling EndMT to improve cardiac repair.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Although change detection is a fundamental aspect of situational awareness, little is known about how hearing impairment affects this ability. This study examined how sensorineural hearing loss influences spatial auditory change detection. Older hearing-impaired listeners (N = 30) completed a spatial change detection task requiring them to identify the appearance of a new sound source within a complex spatialised acoustic scene. Hearing loss was characterised by three factors that were measured with standard clinical tests: audiometric hearing thresholds, sensitivity to small level changes, and sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation. Simple and mixed-effects linear models were used to test how these factors predicted reaction time, hit rate, and false alarm rate. Listeners with poorer spectrotemporal sensitivity, higher audiometric hearing thresholds, and older age showed slower and less accurate detection, whereas sensitivity to small changes in level did not predict outcomes. Detection also varied with spatial location, where appearing sources from behind were detected more slowly and less accurately than those from the front or sides. Numerical analysis using head-related transfer functions confirmed that these rear-field effects were unlikely to be explained by overall or frequency-specific acoustic level differences. These findings reveal that hearing loss, age, and spatial factors jointly shape listeners' ability to monitor dynamic auditory scenes. Additionally, testing spectrotemporal sensitivity offers a promising clinical measure of non-speech auditory processing with relevance for hearing-aid fitting and situational awareness.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluated HD10.6 cells, a simplified and easily expandable human sensory neuron line to model VZV latency and reactivation. Mature HD10.6 (mHD10.6) differentiated neurons supported productive VZV infection, viral DNA replication, production of infectious progeny, and viral spread in cultures. VZV infection was associated with limited cytopathic effects and ultrastructural changes. Infecting mHD10.6 neurons with cell-free VZV in the presence of antivirals resulted in a quiescent-persistent state, characterized by persistent VZV genomes with restricted VZV gene expression and absence of infectious virus. Importantly, VZV could be reactivated by treatment with capsaicin, as evidenced by increased lytic viral transcription and virus spread. In conclusion, this study establishes human HD10.6 neurons as a novel and scalable in vitro model for studying VZV latency and reactivation to identify virus and host factors governing latency that may serve as therapeutic targets to restrict VZV reactivation.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Diets containing 0-100% fishmeal replacement, corresponding to up to 220 g SCP per kg feed, were tested. Survival remained consistently high at all inclusion levels, and growth performance was maintained up to 90% replacement. Tissue proximate and amino acid profiles were unaffected by SCP inclusion. Beyond nutritional adequacy, survival consistently improved with higher SCP inclusion, suggesting functional benefits linked to microbial communities and their postbiotic metabolites that may enhance shrimp resilience. These findings demonstrate that microbial community-based SCP can replace up to 90% of fishmeal in shrimp diets without adverse effects, offering a robust and scalable strategy for valorising food-processing wastewater into sustainable and functional aquafeed ingredients.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

This technology unlocked characterization of natural RNA modifications and long RNA isoforms without the inherent biases of PCR amplification. In the library preparation prior to Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing, polyadenylated RNAs are copied by a reverse transcriptase (RT) to generate an RNA-cDNA hybrid. The step aims to eliminate the secondary and tertiary structure inherent to most RNA sequences prior to presentation of the RNA strand to the pore for sequencing. The current recommended protocol for DRS utilizes Induro (R) RT and requires reverse transcription at 60 {degrees} C. We demonstrate that these RT conditions promote hydrolysis of the RNA strand. We further show that UltraMarathonRT (R) (uMRT), an ultraprocessive reverse transcriptase with intrinsic helicase activity that works optimally at 30 {degrees} C, can be incorporated into a new uMRT-based DRS method that results in longer RNA reads in ONT DRS and longer final isoform predictions. We optimize this reaction along with other molecular biology steps and demonstrate the performance improvements of this new workflow on the benchmark sample, Universal Human Reference RNA, along with human brain RNA.

While individual chromosome ends maintain distinct telomere lengths, the extent of this conservation across tissues and populations remains unclear due to the difficulty of analyzing repetitive telomeric sequences. Here, we show that high-coverage whole-genome Nanopore sequencing enables robust measurement of telomere length at the level of individual chromosomes. Nanopore reads yield reproducible telomere length estimates across replicates, in contrast to PacBio HiFi reads. Across > 250 individuals from 1000 Genomes and the SMaHT projects, chromosome- specific telomere length patterns are conserved across individuals and tissues, with tissues from the same individual showing highly similar patterns. This conserved landscape suggests coordinated regulation, whose disruption may contribute to genomic instability. Nanopore sequencing also allows simultaneous detection of structural variants, including disruption of TERT and NHP2 that drive global telomere shortening. Furthermore, our quantification of telomere variant repeats in positional context indicates active telomerase-mediated elongation. Our integrated profiling of telomere length and structural variation enables inference of variant effects on chromosome-specific telomere dynamics and may uncover risk factors for short telomere syndromes and cancer. Importantly, positionally fully resolved telomeric variant repeat patterns may predict activated telomere maintenance mechanisms with high accuracy.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

The endocannabinoid system (ECS), through cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs), is a key modulator of feeding, metabolism, and gut-brain signaling. While global CB1R blockade improves metabolic control, its clinical translation has been limited by adverse neuropsychiatric effects, underscoring the therapeutic potential of peripherally restricted CB1R inhibition whose neural mechanisms remain insufficiently defined. Here, we show that two peripheral CB1R antagonists, the inverse agonist JD-5037 and the neutral antagonist AM6545, selectively suppress food intake and shift nutrient partitioning toward fat oxidation in obese, but not lean, mice, without altering total energy expenditure. We further demonstrate that high-fat exposure markedly upregulates CB1R expression in the nodose ganglia, suggesting an enhanced reliance on periphery-to-brain ECS signaling in obesity. Using cFos mapping, we reveal that inhibition of peripheral CB1Rs robustly recruits satiety-related brainstem and hypothalamic structures. Interestingly, disruption of the gut-brain vagal axis abolishes JD-5037-induced activation of brainstem nuclei but leaves hypothalamic activation, and the anorexigenic response, fully intact. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of key vagal endocrine mediators, cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), fails to blunt the feeding-suppressive effects of peripheral CB1R blockade. These findings uncover an unprecedent dual mechanism whereby vagal pathways mediate brainstem engagement, whereas hypothalamic recruitment and metabolic benefits arise through vagal-independent signaling. Our results position peripheral CB1R inhibition as a mechanistically distinct approach capable of engaging central homeostatic circuits without direct brain penetration, supporting peripherally acting CB1R antagonists as promising therapeutics for obesity and metabolic disorders.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

According to the zoom lens model, attention can narrow or broaden its spatial extent, with narrower focus enhancing processing efficiency, a mechanism that would benefit target discrimination in crowded displays. We tested whether observers adjust attentional scope when expecting sparse versus dense search arrays by combining spatial cueing with block-wise manipulations of display density expectations. Participants performed a visual search task in which endogenous cues predicted target location, while blocks predominantly contained either sparse (1 target, 3 distractors) or dense (1 target, 7 distractors) displays. We applied inverted encoding models to EEG data to reconstruct spatial channel tuning functions, enabling precise characterization of both the locus and breadth of attentional deployment. Behaviorally, expecting difficult searches selectively improved accuracy at cued locations without costs elsewhere. Consistent with this selective benefit, neural measurements revealed that expectancy enhanced the amplitude of spatially selective responses at the attended location but did not alter tuning width. These findings demonstrate that expectations about search difficulty modulate attention through gain-based signal enhancement rather than adjustments to spatial scope, revealing that preparatory attentional control operates via amplitude modulation within a stable spatial focus. This mechanism complements reactive attentional adjustments and provides an efficient means for the visual system to optimize processing under predictable task demands.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

These tasks, collectively known as multi-assembly, aim to reconstruct multiple genomic sequences from reads obtained from mixed samples. The reads are first organized into a directed graph (e.g., overlap graph, splice graph), where each edge has an integer weight representing the number of supporting reads. By viewing the graph as a flow network, the underlying sequences and their abundances can be extracted through decomposition into a minimum number of weighted paths. Although this problem is NP-hard, prior work has proposed an efficient heuristic that transforms the graph by identifying nontrivial equations in the flow values. However, for graphs with complex structures, many equations cannot be fully resolved by existing mechanisms, leading to suboptimal decompositions. In this study, we revisit the theoretical framework of the flow decomposition problem and extend the equation-resolving mechanisms to jointly model all equations in the graph, enabling safe merge operations that iteratively simplify the graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our new algorithm substantially improves decomposition quality over existing heuristics, achieving near-optimal solutions for complex graphs, while running several orders of magnitude faster than the ILP formulation.

We observed a substantial heterogeneity of the transcriptomic signatures in mGLS samples which is driven by different compositions of immune infiltrates. In mGLS, gene expression signatures strongly indicate epidermis dysfunction and overexpression of epithelial inflammation marker Keratin 6 (KRT6) and chitinase CHIT1. No significant changes in the expression levels of known GLS markers such as VIM, CTNNB1, LGALS7 and ECM1 were detected. However, significant changes in the expression levels of genes associated with autoimmune diseases and genes upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma were observed, including TNF, CCNB1 and RUNX3.

L.; Forbes, V. E.", "abstract": "Computational models of stress responses can highlight candidate genes underlying physiological adaptation, but their utility depends on rigorous validation. Using existing biological databases, we tested a novel approach to identify and group differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from RNA-seq data. The approach was used to build a neural network to model the epigenetic response of human cells to temperature stress. A Key-Response, Treatment Specific, Support, and Noisy group of genes were identified as representing the Principal Response of the species to the stress. The Support Group was also suspected to represent housekeeping genes based on variability patterns. To validate these assumptions, we built protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using the Human Protein Atlas and STRING-db, incorporating both direct and second-order connections. Crucially, second-order connections were restricted to those made via DEGs, ensuring that connectivity reflected condition-specific stress responses rather than generic hubs. Across two conditions, >75% of Principal Response genes assembled into LCCs significantly larger than random networks (p<0.00005). Support Group genes also showed strong connectivity and enriched overlap with a housekeeping gene database, supporting their distinct classification. STRING-db confirmed PPI enrichment but produced less reliable results than our DEG-restricted framework. Overall, this study demonstrates that the model identifies biologically meaningful, interconnected stress-response networks. By emphasizing DEG-restricted second-order connections, our framework addresses key limitations of context-free enrichment methods and advances validation strategies for computational models of gene regulation, with implications for stress physiology and personalized medicine.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Existing computational efforts to understand these mechanisms are simplistic or have limited scope. This works presents a comprehensive approach for understanding these mechanisms by elucidating the cascade of interactions that allows gut microbes to influence brain disorders.

The fatal neurological toxicities observed in the MAGE-A3 TCR-T cell trial, potentially linked to unanticipated cross-reactivity with EPS8L2- and MAGEA12-derived peptides, underscore the urgent need for more comprehensive safety assessment. Current preclinical de-risking methods rely on peptide-centric similarity searches performed in isolation, failing to capture the complex landscape of peptide cross-reactivity and leaving safety gaps unaddressed.

Earlier studies indicated that mutations within the ELF4-binding domain of ELF3 reduced the nuclear accumulation of ELF3. However, it has remained unknown whether ELF4 directly contributes to these phenotypes. To investigate this further, we quantified the cellular and subnuclear distribution of Arabidopsis ELF3 across the evening in hypocotyl nuclei with or without a functional ELF4 allele. These results highlight a critical requirement for ELF4 in recruiting ELF3 to hypocotyl nuclei at dusk. Reduced nuclear accumulation in the elf4 mutant correlated with a failure of ELF3 to repress gene expression and inhibit hypocotyl elongation, particularly under short-day conditions. We also observed that ELF4 was necessary to recruit ELF3 to foci in root nuclei, but these foci displayed different temporal properties from those in the hypocotyl.

Glacial expansion forced many species south and came with much colder global temperatures, while glacial recession brought warmer temperatures and newly colonizable land without competition. However, the changes in plant diversity associated with glacial retreat and the ensuing climatic changes is not well understood. In this study, we quantify Late Quaternary climate-driven changes in Arctic plant diversity by integrating climatic shifts in species distributions since the last glacial maximum (20-16 kya) and mid-Holocene (5 kya) across the circumpolar arctic. Location The geographic arctic, 66N. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods We built species distribution models using phyloregion v. 1.0.9 in R using occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and climate rasters from Worldclim v2.1 for the present and v1.4 for the mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum. Results and Discussion We found limited evidence for decreases in weighted endemism, and species richness along with diverging north-south shifts in the centroids of many distributions contrary to expectations of increased alpha diversity since the last glacial maximum. Decreases in species alpha diversity, while already quite low in the arctic, may be reflective of an increasingly variable arctic climate that disfavors plants with a slow dispersal ability. This is especially important given the projected increase in global temperature across many shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios and can be contrasted with our results of the Mid-Holocene, which was roughly a degree warmer than it is today. The arctic is presently warming at roughly two to five times the rate of the mid-latitudes and equator and understanding how plants have responded in the past will help inform on how they may change in the future.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Forest degradation is posing a growing threat to biodiversity conservation, climate regulation and nature contributions to people worldwide. The EU Nature Restoration Regulation (NRR) recognise the need of healthy forests and has established indicators to assess the condition of forest ecosystems. Forest management practices, especially harvesting may contribute to improve these indicators by, for example, reducing tree density and promoting tree species diversification. 2. Here, we assessed temporal trends in forest condition indicators (hereafter, indicators) across Iberian forests since the 80s and evaluated how harvesting occurrence and intensity modulated these trends. Using 46,354 plots from the Spanish Forest Inventory (1986-2022), we analysed trends in indicators depending on stand diversity (monospecific or mixed), protection status (protected or unprotected), origin of the stand (natural or planted), and biogeographical region (Mediterranean or temperate). 3. Overall, indicators increased over time. Harvesting occurrence reduced the increases in aboveground carbon stocks, structural diversity, tree species diversity, and standing deadwood; however, it contributed to increase the proportion of native species in specific forest types. Medium to high harvesting intensity negatively impacted aboveground carbon stocks, while medium intensities increased tree species diversity but reduced the structural diversity. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that indicators are increasing as stand develops in absence of disturbances such as harvesting. Tree harvesting cannot be considered as a silver bullet to achieve the objectives of the NRR, but it can contribute under certain conditions, specifically at low intensities for carbon stocks and at medium intensities for species diversity. The naturally positive trend of indicators underlines the need to establish thresholds values and minimum rates of changes that distinguish restoration outcomes from natural dynamics. Finally, our study also highlights the key role of forest inventories in monitoring forest condition over time and across diverse landscapes.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Urban expansion increasingly fragments these habitats through trampling, beach grooming, and nutrient inputs, yet the effects of urbanization on below-ground fungal diversity remain poorly understood. We used eDNA metabarcoding on 294 soil cores from 49 transects spanning 35 km of the Dutch coast to test how urban proximity influences total fungal diversity and composition in different functional guilds (litter saprotrophs, plant pathogens, mycorrhizal fungi) across incipient (early-successional) and established dunes. Urban effects were habitat-specific and generally strongest in incipient dunes. In incipient dunes, total alpha diversity showed a U-shaped relationship with city distance, with minima at intermediate distances, whereas established dunes showed weak responses. Fungal guilds diverged in their responses as predicted: litter saprotroph diversity increased with distance from cities in both habitats (consistent with greater organic inputs by vegetation), plant pathogens showed U-shaped diversity in incipient dunes, suggesting distinct urban-associated and native-associated assemblages, and mycorrhizal diversity increased with distance in both habitats, consistent with limited suitable hosts and higher disturbance near cities. Partitioning of beta diversity revealed that turnover, rather than nestedness, accounted for almost all variation in community composition, indicating taxon replacement rather than directional loss. Community uniqueness was higher near cities, particularly in incipient dunes and for most guilds, implying that urban environments foster compositionally atypical assemblages relative to the regional pool. Overall, urbanization acts as a trait-based environmental filter, restructuring fungal communities without necessarily reducing fungal diversity. Stronger responses in early-successional dunes highlight their vulnerability to combined natural and urban stressors and the need to prioritize protection of incipient coastal habitats under intensifying urban pressure.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Coinciding with reflectance measurements, trees in a glasshouse were exposed to normal and extreme climatic conditions including heatwaves and a drought, while collecting concurrent climate variables and soil moisture content. Our analysis of FMC timeseries of glasshouse trees found the diel range of leaf FMC was 23 % dry weight (DW, i.e. 19 % fresh weight) on average, between a minimum and maximum diel range of 10 %DW and 46 %DW, as predicted by an accurate spectral regression model (r2=0.96, RMSE=9.29 %DW).

Early snowmelt caused early onset of greening and diminished extraradical hyphal production by mycorrhiza. Plant-fungal asynchrony was accompanied by smaller pools of available P and N, suggesting early, direct nutrient adsorption by plants lowered host investment in mycorrhizal fungal partners. The mycorrhizal symbiosis was weakened during a critical period of nutrient exchange. These findings point to the vulnerability of belowground mutualisms to warming winters, and highlight the need to incorporate fungal phenology into predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change. Future work scaling early snowmelt effects on belowground microbes to watershed N & P dynamics, or loss of N to the atmosphere, may provide a clearer picture on the relationships between warming winter, nutrient cycling, and plant-fungal asynchrony. The AM fungal community was highly variable across the growing season, indicating that mycorrhizal responses to warming are context-dependent on seasonal variation of soil resources and trait-based community assembly. Together, our results show that warming winters disrupt the seasonal timing of plant fungal interactions, potentially triggering nutrient-limitation feedbacks with potential consequences that extend from soil microbial processes to watershed-scale N and P cycling. By revealing both the sensitivity of belowground mutualisms to warming and the strong seasonal shifts in AM fungal community structure, this study underscores the importance of integrating fungal phenology, microbial functional traits, and nutrient-cycling mechanisms into predictions of ecosystem stability under continued climate change.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Modern developments in the field revealed that this selective force extends beyond Darwins initial focus on access to mates in terms of competition for access to gametes of the other sex. Despite its presumed universality, sexual selection theory remains largely untested in plants compared to animals. This gap may partly stem from challenges in quantifying sexual selection using approaches that account for a critical plant-specific factor: the reliance on pollinators as third-party agents for accessing mates. Here, we quantified sexual selection along consecutive episodes of selection in the hermaphroditic plant Brassica rapa by integrating the monitoring of pollinator movements with genetic paternity analyses in experimental populations. Our approach identifies pollen competition for ovules as the primary arena for sexual selection in B. rapa. Darwinian competition for access to mates constitutes a secondary force, and was stronger in the male compared to the female sex function, as predicted by classic theory. Importantly, experimentally induced variation in pollinator abundance modulated the balance between pre- and post-pollination sexual selection. Under reduced pollinator abundance, the opportunity for selection on mate acquisition increased. Crucially, we demonstrate that ignoring pollinator movements among plants leads to erroneous quantification of pre-pollination sexual selection. We argue that a unifying theory of sexual selection requires a more comprehensive quantification of pre- and post-pollination episodes of selection, taking into account the specificities of gamete transfer in plants.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

We investigated KpSC transmission, pangenome structure and diversity, and functional gene enrichment across four distinct habitats in Burgundy, France over one year. In total, 664 environmental samples were collected from an organic vegetable farm (n=329), an organic cattle farm (n=304) and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP; n=31), alongside 47 clinical isolates. KpSC was detected in 22.4% of environmental samples, most commonly in WWTP (83.9%), followed by vegetable farm (27.1%) and cattle farm (11.2%). A total of 336 isolates were collected and whole-genome sequenced. K. pneumoniae sensu stricto (phylogroup Kp1) was predominant (76%), followed by K. variicola subsp. variicola (phylogroup Kp3) (21%). Genomic analyses revealed substantial novel diversity, especially in environmental habitats (67 novel STs), with limited cross transmission but clear local persistence. Over 90% of environmental isolates lacked acquired antimicrobial resistance genes, whereas half of the clinical isolates exhibited a multi-drug resistance profile. Comparative pangenome analyses showed Kp1 possessed a larger and more diverse pangenome than Kp3. Human-associated populations (clinical and WWTP) shared similar pangenome structures, although clinical isolates exhibited an expanded accessory genome. Cattle farm isolates had the most restricted and distinct pangenome while vegetable farm isolates displayed the largest total genomic repertoire. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted Kp3 environmental adaptation via conserved functions linked to the phylogroup genetic background, such as metabolic and regulatory pathways, including nitrogen fixation genes. Contrarily, human-associated populations, especially Kp1 members, were enriched in acquired functions linked to the ecological context, including antimicrobial and metal resistance determinants and mobile genetic elements. These findings emphasize phylogroup- and ecological niche-driven pangenome contrasts in KpSC, contributing to explain the successful adaptation of Kp1 to multiple habitats, including human-related settings.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Several seed-sourcing (i.e., provenancing) strategies have been proposed, which balance the use of locally adapted genotypes against mixed genotypes to reduce mutation load or assistant migration to anticipate future climate scenarios. However, taxonomic uncertainty and lack of data characterizing genetic differentiation and gene flow have hindered provenancing strategies for many ecologically important non-model plant species, especially those in remote but vulnerable regions like the boreal forests of northern Canada. To guide provenancing strategies following anthropogenic disturbance in Canadas Northwest Territories, we characterize species-specific markers, population structure, and hybridization among three Calamagrostis species. Double digest RAD sequencing (ddRAD) resulted in 2,951 polymorphic loci across 27 individuals, which we used to design loci for genotyping in thousands by sequencing (GT-seq), a cost-efficient target loci approach resulting in 256 polymorphic loci across 93 individuals from wild C. canadensis, C. stricta ssp. inexpansa and C. purpurascens populations. To help define the scale of 'local' populations for seed sourcing, we characterized geographic variation and population structure among 57 wild collection sites. We also assessed genetic relationships of wild C. canadensis to 69 individuals across eight commercially maintained populations used in restoration projects. We found that GT-seq yields similar genetic differentiation patterns as common neutral molecular marker approaches like ddRAD-seq. Specifically, we resolve morphologically misidentified individuals, identify genetic hybrids, and characterize the scale of genetic isolation-by-distance. Finally, we determined that three cultivar seed sources were genetically similar to southern wild populations, whereas five cultivars aligned with northern wild populations of C. canadensis in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Overall, our results highlight the benefits of cost-effective methods for genome-wide multi-locus genotyping to inform provenancing best-practices and support more effective and sustainable restoration efforts.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Y.; Suzuki, I. K.", "abstract": "The neocortex is responsible for higher-order cognitive abilities such as language, abstract reasoning, and executive function - capacities that are particularly advanced in humans. To elucidate the molecular foundations of neocortical evolution in the human lineage, it is essential to examine how conserved gene repertoires have undergone expression changes relative to other mammals. The expression changes in conserved genes are widely regarded as key drivers of the phenotypic evolution of human-specific traits. In this study, we performed a comprehensive comparative single-cell transcriptomic analysis of fetal neocortical development across four mammalian species: human, macaque, mouse, and ferret. To validate human-specific expression changes, we further analyzed brain organoids derived from both human and chimpanzee stem cells. Genes exhibiting human-specific expression shifts were systematically classified along three orthogonal dimensions: overall expression level (Human Level Distinctive; HLD), temporal expression trend (Human Trend Distinctive; HTD), and differentiation lineage specificity (Human Differentiation trajectory Distinctive; HDD). HLD genes were frequently enriched for long introns and located near Human Accelerated Regions (HARs), and showed pronounced upregulation in humans. These genes were strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and developmental delay, as well as with megalencephaly and glioblastoma. HTD genes, in contrast, exhibited a unique pattern in humans, peaking early in development and subsequently declining - opposite to the steadily increasing trends observed in other species. These genes were significantly enriched for oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal functions, pointing to a temporally restricted elevation in biosynthetic activity in early human corticogenesis. HDD genes displayed a marked shift in lineage-specific expression: cilia-related genes that are typically expressed in apical progenitors in non-human species were instead highly expressed in outer radial glia (oRGs) in humans. This spatial reorganization of ciliary gene activity suggests an oRG-specific adaptation in signaling architecture. Together, these results highlight the diversity of regulatory changes that have shaped human cortical development. Distinct classes of gene expression evolution - mediated in part by HARs - appear to have contributed not only to the expansion and increased complexity of the human neocortex, but also to its heightened vulnerability to neurodevelopmental and oncogenic pathologies. The identified human distinctive genes will be the target of future experimental verification to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms regulating human-specific aspects of cortical development.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a robust metric derived from the quantification of splicing in the RNA-seq data to measure NMD efficiency at a sample level. We demonstrate that NMD efficiency varies substantially both between and within tissues, with the magnitude of variation comparable to that observed upon knockdown of the core NMD factor UPF1. By analyzing TCGA cancer cohorts, we further show that, in many tumors, unproductive splicing events exhibit coordinated changes towards either collective suppression or collective activation of NMD isoforms, which is indicative of a global deregulation of the NMD pathway activity. Consistently, we observed a striking divergence of NMD efficiency in cancers from the tissue-specific baseline level suggesting that tumors partially erase the NMD signature of their tissue of origin. The application of the developed metric to RNA-binding protein knockdowns allowed identification of several novel potential regulators of NMD efficiency.

Although multiple intracortical pathways contribute to contextual modulation, their specific contributions to different types of contextual modulation are not fully understood. Leveraging the distinct laminar connectivity patterns of feedforward, feedback, and lateral pathways, we used ultra-high-resolution fMRI (7T T$_2$*-weighted, 0.6 mm isotropic resolution) to infer their relative contributions to contextual modulation in V1 by analyzing blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across cortical depth. Participants viewed sine-wave grating disks embedded in large surround gratings. Segmentation cues were introduced or removed by manipulating the relative phase and orientation of the surround gratings, yielding three contextual conditions and a surround-only condition to measure the effects of context in the absence of feedforward input. Our analysis isolated the effects of orientation-tuned surround suppression (OTSS) from orientation-independent border-induced modulation (BIM). The results show that BOLD laminar profiles differ by modulation type: BIM affected both deep and superficial voxels, while OTSS was absent in deep voxels. We also find that voxels at all depths are driven by spatial context in the absence of feedforward input, which accords with the discovery of contextually-driven neural responses in mammalian V1. These laminar differences likely reflect distinct contributions of feedback from higher-order visual areas and long-range lateral connections within V1.

Here, we investigated how noradrenergic inputs from the locus coeruleus (LC) to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) support adaptive learning under uncertainty. We show that rats performing a probabilistic reversal learning task exhibited behavior that was best explained by an adaptive reinforcement-learning model in which learning rates dynamically adjust according to estimated environmental volatility and stochasticity, outperforming standard fixed-rate models.

While criticality has been extensively studied at local scales (within neuronal populations) and at global scales (across interacting brain regions), the interplay between these levels remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a multiscale computational framework that bridges local and global criticality within a single, mechanistic model. At the mesoscopic level, individual brain regions are represented by neural mass models tuned near the transition between asynchronous and synchronous regimes. These regions are then coupled via an empirically derived mouse connectome to investigate how structural connectivity shapes the emergence of large-scale coordination. We show that (i) local near critical dynamics for an isolated brain region can be faithfully reproduced within a mean-field model framework, (ii) local distance to criticality is modulated by long-range coupling, (iii) whole-brain simulations reveal non-linear gradients of timescales and heterogeneous shifts towards/away from local criticality, and (iv) global criticality, manifested in scale-free avalanche distributions and optimal functional connectivity, emerges when local populations are locally tuned near criticality and coupled within an optimal range. These results demonstrate that local and global criticality are dynamically intertwined but not directly aligned, and that their relationship depends on the underlying structural connectivity.

Oscillatory activity in the primary motor cortex is closely linked to motor execution and reflects the dynamic properties of cortical function, yet motor-related oscillations have rarely been examined directly in children born preterm. In this study, we investigated motor-induced gamma oscillations in school-aged children born preterm using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Eighteen children born preterm and nineteen age- and IQ-matched children born at full term (5 to 7 years old) completed a child-friendly dominant-hand finger movement task during recording with a child-customised MEG system. The preterm group exhibited significantly slower response times and approximately twenty-two per cent weaker contralateral gamma power compared with their full-term peers. They also showed reduced hemispheric lateralisation, indicating greater bilateral cortical engagement. Motor-related gamma power and lateralisation indices were positively associated with perinatal factors and motor performance scores.

Yet their conservation is increasingly threatened by the decline of disturbance regimes maintained by both megaherbivores and traditional agro-silvo-pastoral practices, leading to afforestation, biodiversity loss, and heightened wildfire risk. To evaluate the conservation potential of restoring megaherbivore communities to rebalance disturbance regimes in Italian wood-pastures, we reconstructed a Holocene, pre-agricultural baseline assemblage and compared its ecological functions with those of the current, impoverished megaherbivore community. Using zooarchaeological records, functional trait data, and allometric estimates of movement capacity and plant biomass removal, we demonstrate that a reconstructed assemblage would substantially increase functional diversity, by +0.19 in Functional Divergence and +0.22 in Functional Dispersion (on a scale from 0 to 1), and result in much higher vegetation consumption (11.88 versus 4.45 t/km), with a shift toward greater grazing. This would support the maintenance of open, heterogeneous habitats, reduce fine-fuel loads, and likely promote long-term soil carbon sequestration, aligning with EU climate and restoration objectives. Enhanced megaherbivore movement capacity would also increase endozoochorous seed dispersal, improving vegetation connectivity and adaptive potential under climate change. Additionally, we synthesized socioeconomic insights through a SWOT analysis of megafauna rewilding in Italy. Key strengths include strong cultural associations with megafauna, active rewilding organizations, and emerging economic opportunities tied to ecotourism and rural branding. However, challenges related to conflict, zoonoses, early-stage management requirements, and limited communication among stakeholders remain substantial.

By contrast, studies of postnatal cerebral cortex have repeatedly associated ASD with transcriptional changes in both neurons and glia. To comprehensively map ASD genetic liability across cortical cell types, we conducted a functional genetic burden analysis with 124,416 individuals, including ASD probands and unaffected family members. We examined six classes of rare gene-disrupting variants aggregated across a complete spectrum of transcriptomic cell types of the human prefrontal cortex throughout development.

Notably, inherited LoF variants uncover the contribution of microglia to ASD liability, also supported by transcriptomic evidence from postmortem ASD brains.

Although the anterior hippocampus is thought to support integration across broad spatiotemporal scales, it matures relatively late, suggesting that its functional development may be key to mature cognitive mapping. Here, we show that anterior hippocampal integration, indexed by temporal autocorrelation of fMRI activation, undergoes prolonged development and predicts age-related improvements in spatial memory. In a large resting-state sample (N=382; aged 5-34 years), temporal autocorrelation increased with age in anterior but not posterior hippocampus. We replicated this anterior pattern in an independent, task-based sample (N=85; aged 6-12 years and adults). Moreover, we linked hippocampal integration to behavior using a spatial navigation task that required participants to adapt to rotations of a virtual environment across learning runs as well as generalize learned cognitive maps when new objects were introduced. Children exhibited lower anterior autocorrelation and re-learned object positions when the environment changed. In adolescents, increasing anterior hippocampal autocorrelation was accompanied by gradual behavioral improvements in locating objects in the face of environmental change. Adults showed the greatest anterior hippocampal autocorrelation, which uniquely supported accurate spatial memory performance through efficient path navigation in the changing environment. These findings identify spatiotemporal integration in anterior hippocampus as a key mechanism underlying the developmental shift from local representation of individual positions in an environment to formation of flexible cognitive maps that are robust and generalizable in the face of environmental change.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

We compared the distribution of the Cannabinoid Receptor-1 (CB1R) and the enzymes, FAAH and MAGL, in autopsy AD brain samples as well as in the J20 (hAPPSwe/Ind) mouse model of AD. Both sources revealed several anti-CB1R immunoreactive species, e.g. one at 47-kDa (corresponding to the protein-coding sequence) and a reported putative splice variant at 37 kDa. We did not observe any changes in the mean expression in CB1R, FAAH or MAGL in the human samples, but did observe sex- and genotype-specific changes in the mouse brain. Regression analysis revealed strong sex- and APOE epsilon4-dependent associations among the CB1Rs as well as between CB1Rs and MAGL (but not FAAH) in human cortical (but not hippocampal) samples. In the J20 mouse, associations between CB1Rs were limited to hippocampal samples, whereas associations between CB1R and both MAGL and FAAH were observed in the cortex. A diagnosis of AD disrupted any associations in the human dataset, whereas in several instances, the associations were enhanced by the hAPPSwe/Ind transgene. This inferred species-dependent regulation of the ECS could impact the clinical translational of ECS outcomes in preclinical models of AD pathology.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

The binary valuation of an experience as either positive or negative - valence assignment - is imperative for successful navigation of a regularly updating environment. Mounting evidence highlights the critical role of valence responsive basolateral amygdala (BLA) ensembles in coding valence information. However, how BLA ensembles are recruited to drive real-time valence assignment remains elusive. Here, we show locus coeruleus (LC)-derived norepinephrine coordinates this neural computational process via modulatory control over network-organizing BLA parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneuron activity. Specifically, optogenetic activation of LC to BLA noradrenergic terminals (LC-BLANE) drives real-time negative valence assignment and suppression of BLA fast gamma oscillatory activity via BLA interneuronal alpha1a adrenergic receptor signaling. Conversely, positive valence assignment also requires BLA PV interneuron activity but is associated with an enhancement of local fast gamma power. Together, these converging data highlight a PV-driven amygdalar oscillatory switch that governs valence assignment.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

However, the cell type-specific NE neuromodulation of the fear circuit in the BLA has not been fully resolved. We reported previously a facilitation of fear memory by Gq-coupled receptor induction of repetitive bursting in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and suppression of gamma oscillations in the BLA. Here, using patch clamp recordings, Cre-dependent DLX-driven intersectional targeting, and genetic manipulations, we demonstrate that NE also activates cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons to generate synchronized trains of rhythmic CB1-sensitive IPSCs in BLA principal neurons via Gq-coupled 1A adrenoreceptor activation. The Gq-dependent mechanism in CCK interneurons is generalizable to chemogenetic Gq manipulation and Gq-coupled 5-HT2C serotoninergic receptor activation. We next tested the role of Gq neuromodulation of CCK interneurons in the regulation of BLA network activity associated with the behavioral expression of fear learning by rescued expression of 1A adrenoreceptors or chemogenetic Gq activation selectively in BLA CCK interneurons in a global 1A adrenoreceptor knockout mouse. Restoration of the rhythmic inhibitory synaptic activity via rescue of Gq-coupled receptor signaling in CCK interneurons enhanced LFP theta power in the BLA in vivo and decreased fear memory acquisition and recall. These data indicate an inhibitory role for CCK interneuron Gq signaling in fear learning via activation of patterned inhibitory synaptic input to principal neurons and enhanced theta oscillations in the BLA, and reveal a G protein-dependent, receptor-nonselective neuromodulatory mechanism in the BLA that regulates network and behavioral states.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Using cell type-specific approaches, we characterized two circuit nodes that are differentially configured by hormones to modulate infant-evoked behavior. An excitatory neuronal population in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus is only active in lactating mothers, increases virgin female caregiving when artificially stimulated and confers oxytocin sensitivity in mothers through a prolactin STAT5b pathway. These neurons function upstream of another preoptic area population involved in male and female parenting, thus boosting caregiving by mothers. By contrast, androgen signaling in the latter preoptic population reshapes their intrinsic properties to promote pup-directed aggression, revealing cell type-specific tuning of social behavior circuits.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Importantly, animal models and initial EEG studies in humans indicate developmental improvements in neural processing of complex information that would be evident in changes in temporal dynamics, which are not well-understood. Intrinsic neural timescales (INTs), or the temporal windows over which neural populations integrate inputs, have been proposed to reflect circuit-level properties such as excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance, myelination, and functional properties supporting complex information processing such as in executive functioning. Here, we used a multimodal, cross-species approach to investigate how INTs develop across adolescence to support cognitive specialization. In parallel analyses using a large longitudinal human EEG cohort, adolescent intracranial sEEG recordings, and macaque local field potentials, we observed robust reductions in INTs through adolescence, particularly in frontal and parietal association cortices. These developmental reductions were shaped by local circuit physiology, as evidenced by associations between shorter INTs and both lower aperiodic exponents, indicative of increased E/I balance, and reduced spectral offsets, suggesting lower aggregate spiking. We also found structural contributions via developmental interactions between age and deep layer intracortical myelination which predicted shorter INTs, suggesting that long-range circuitry may play a key role in shaping spontaneous temporal dynamics. Functionally, shorter INTs in adolescence were linked to improved working memory accuracy and reduced response time variability, indicating a behavioral advantage of refined temporal integration windows through development. Together, these findings establish INTs as a conserved, biologically grounded signature of adolescent brain maturation, providing a mechanistic framework for how structural and physiological refinements reorganize temporal processing to support increasingly efficient cognitive function.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

The current study identifies a cell-type specific role for Fkbp5, a glucocorticoid receptor co-chaperone, in noradrenergic neurons engaged during social stress. Acute social stress upregulated Fkbp5 in the locus coeruleus (LC), whereas repeated exposure attenuated this effect. Noradrenergic Fkbp5 deletion (Fkbp5Nat) increased pro-social behavior exclusively in male mice. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA), social interaction reduced norepinephrine (NE) turnover in wild-type but not Fkbp5Nat mice. Consistently, proteomics revealed mitochondrial/energy and synapse-related remodeling in BLA neurons. Miniscope imaging showed that behavior-locked NE transients in BLA were selectively blunted in Fkbp5Nat mice during interaction with outbred CD1 conspecifics, while same-strain C57BL/6N encounters preserved NE dynamics. Together, this study indicates that Fkbp5 tunes LC-BLA output to social salience in a sex- and context-dependent manner, suggesting a circuit-specific route to normalize social salience without broadly suppressing noradrenergic function.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Rapid memory consolidation during brief rests is crucial, but the causal role of the hippocampus remains unclear. Here, we used personalized transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) to non-invasively modulate the hippocampus. We found that hippocampal neuromodulation fundamentally alters how a skill is learned. Compared to sham stimulation, TUS shifted performance gains from rest periods (offline consolidation) to active practice (online learning). Paradoxically, this manipulation not only reshaped the learning process but also boosted overall performance by unmasking a latent and highly efficient online learning pathway, leading to superior skill retention 24 hours later. These findings provide causal evidence that the hippocampus acts as a gating mechanism, governing a key trade-off between online and offline learning pathways. Our work demonstrates that non-invasive deep brain modulation can causally alter the balance between competing memory systems, opening new avenues to optimize human performance.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

We defined CHD8 interactions using a comprehensive multimodal omics approach. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) identified a complex interaction network enriched for chromatin remodeling, RNA processing, and cytoskeletal proteins in neonatal mouse forebrain. We implemented CHD8-TurboID in HEK293T cells, validating IP-MS signatures and further identifying a role in mitosis. In addition to DNA, Chd8 complexed with RNA in mouse forebrain, with affinity for genes associated with RNA splicing and nervous system development and overlap between Chd8-bound mRNA and promoters. Finally, Chd8 interaction affinity with RNA splicing factors was reduced in Chd8 haploinsufficient mice. These findings expand understanding of CHD8 function and identify a dosage-sensitive NDD-relevant role in chromatin-associated RNA processing.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

Notably, the endogenization and proliferation of retroviral infections within host genomes has introduced numerous species-specific regulatory elements that have the potential to influence gene regulation. However, the role of these endogenous retroviruses in hominoid brain evolution remains unclear. A burst of lineage-specific PTERV1 retroviruses recently invaded the chimpanzee genome but are absent in humans. We conducted an epigenomic analysis of PTERV1 insertions in chimpanzee neural organoids and found that they are heavily covered by DNA methylation, representing more than 150 species-specific heterochromatin domains with the capacity to influence gene regulatory networks. We identified one such chimpanzee-specific PTERV1 insertion on chromosome 19 that blocks the expression of the long noncoding RNA LINC00662, via DNA methylation spread to the adjacent genomic region. The expression of LINC00662 was restored in chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells when we deleted the PTERV1 insertion using CRISPR editing. We found that LINC00662, a human-specific RNA, is highly expressed in the developing brain and plays an important role in the posttranscriptional control of neuronal maturation, axon outgrowth, and neural organoid development. In summary, our findings describe how endogenous retroviral insertions contributed to the functional divergence of the human and chimpanzee brains. This provides a new mechanism by which retroviral pandemics influenced primate brain speciation.", "date": "2025-12-12", "journal": ""}

To address this challenge, we developed a comprehensive set of DNA regulatory element modules (REMO) for the human genome. Here we show how REMO can be applied to single-cell chromatin data to better separate cell states in a low-dimensional space compared to peak matrix quantification, greatly improve the scalability of dimension reduction steps, and enable automated annotation of cell types.
