Advances in sequencing and sensor networks have reduced costs of acquiring genomic and environmental data; however, collecting phenotypic data, crucial for monitoring plant growth and detecting pests and diseases, remains labor-intensive. Technological advances have enabled efficient collection of three-dimensional (3D) data, yet this process currently involves intricate steps. Therefore, developing effective phenotyping methods is essential. In this study, we developed a phenotyping process based on 3D data, including mask image generation using deep neural network models, 3D reconstruction using the Structure from Motion/Multi-View Stereo (SfM/MVS) pipeline, and surface reconstruction for leaf area estimation. Using soybean datasets, we found that a 1/5.4x magnification effectively generated mask images. Among four mask image usage scenarios in SfM/MVS, applying soybean-and-stage masks before SfM and only soybean masks after SfM yielded the highest-quality point cloud data with the second shortest processing time. Finally, we compared Poisson reconstruction and B-spline surface fitting in leaf area estimation; B-spline fitting showed greater correlation with destructive measurements. We propose an optimal workflow for estimating leaf area and provide tools and datasets for future phenotyping research.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a recently identified mechanism, mitigates ribosome collisions resulting from frequent translation stalls. However, the precise pathophysiological role of the RQC pathway in oncogenesis remains ambiguous. Our research centered on the pathogenic implications of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing), a specific RQC response to translational arrest on the outer mitochondrial membrane, in glioblastoma (GBM). The presence of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins was observed commonly in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Exogenous introduction of mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5) protein with artificial CAT-tail mimicking sequences enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) and inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation. These alterations in mitochondrial characteristics provided resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Consequently, msiCAT-tailing can foster cell survival and migration, whereas blocking msiCAT-tailing via genetic or pharmacological intervention can impede GBM cell overgrowth.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

We show that SARS-CoV-2 blocks lysosomal cholesterol export through its protein ORF3a. ORF3a binds the HOPS subunit VPS39, and disrupting this interaction restores cholesterol trafficking. Two mechanisms underlie this defect. First, ORF3a-VPS39 interaction traps the sorting receptor CI-MPR and the retrieval complex retromer in endosomes/lysosomes, impairing trafficking of the cholesterol transporter NPC2. Retromer deletion reproduced these defects. Second, ORF3a reduces bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphates (BMPs), lysosomal lipids required for cholesterol export. Lipidomics and proteomics revealed altered metabolism of BMP precursors, mitochondrial phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), and reduced mitochondrial proteins at lysosomes. ORF3a-VPS39 interaction decreased lysosome-mitochondrion membrane contact sites (MCS), excluding autophagy or mitochondrion-derived vesicles as routes for PG transfer. VPS39 deletion decreased the MCS and BMPs. These findings identify VPS39 as a regulator of NPC2 trafficking and BMP biosynthesis and reveal that ORF3a disrupts both pathways to block cholesterol egress.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

While early MIA biosynthesis preserves the 3S configuration, the mechanism underlying C3 inversion has remained unresolved. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize a conserved oxidase-reductase pair in the Gentianales order: the heteroyohimbine/yohimbine/corynanthe C3-oxidase (HYC3O) and C3-reductase (HYC3R), which together invert the 3S stereochemistry to 3R across diverse substrates. Notably, HYC3O and HYC3R reside in gene clusters in Rauvolfia tetraphylla and Catharanthus roseus, homologous to an elusive geissoschizine synthase (GS) cluster we also uncovered. In R. tetraphylla, these clusters are in tandem on a single chromosome, likely derived from segmental duplication, whereas in C. roseus they reside on separate chromosomes due to translocation. Comparative genomics indicate the GS cluster originated at the base of Gentianales (~135 Mya), coinciding with the evolution of the strictosidine synthase cluster, while the reserpine cluster arose later in rauvolfioid Apocynaceae. Together, these findings uncover the genomic and biochemical basis for key events in MIA evolution and diversification, providing insights beyond the canonical vinblastine and ajmaline biosynthetic pathways.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

The altered abiotic conditions and biotic interactions in urban habitats impose divergent selection pressures on urban versus rural populations, while genetic drift may also be significant in typically small urban populations. A key question in urban evolution concerns the origin and spread of urban genotypes. Examples exist of both single and multiple origins of urban genotypes, but these have proven difficult to generalize. Here, we address genetic differentiation among urban populations, among rural populations, and between urban and rural populations. We conducted an extensive population genomic double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing analysis of two non-model grassland lepidopterans, Coenonympha pamphilus and Chiasmia clathrata, across Europe. The genetic population structures of the study species were strikingly different: Co. pamphilus showed strong population differentiation, while this was almost absent in Ch. clathrata, which instead showed signs of high current and past gene flow among populations. Results of Co. pamphilus are consistent with multiple origins of urban populations, and multiple origins seem plausible also in Ch. clathrata. These results suggest that past and large-scale population dynamics need to be integrated into urban evolution research, because population history affects urban evolutionary dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

As NET formation gains attention as an endpoint in in vitro immunotoxicity screening, the lack of reproducible and scalable systems hampers its broader application. Here, we developed an in vitro assay using HL-60-derived neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) differentiated with all-trans retinoic acid to evaluate NET-inducing activity in a standardized, non-animal model. Graphene oxide (GO), a model nanomaterial known to trigger NETs in primary neutrophils, induced concentration-dependent NET formation in dHL-60 cells, with maximal induction at intermediate doses and attenuation at higher concentrations, likely due to particle aggregation. NET formation was validated by extracellular DNA staining and scanning electron microscopy. GO also induced superoxide-mediated ROS production, as confirmed by electron spin resonance, consistent with canonical NETosis pathways. Furthermore, GO suppressed PMA-induced NET formation, suggesting a dose- and context-dependent immunomodulatory effect.

M.", "abstract": "From the perspective of uniparental markers, the view of the human prehistoric settlement of America is that it resulted from a single main migration after the Last Glacial Maximum, following a period of prolonged stasis in Beringia. These pioneers rapidly expanded across a continent previously uninhabited by humans, forming isolated population groups that became genetically distinct. Ancient DNA studies and whole genome analyses have confirmed this view, revealing a remarkable complexity in the ancestries of the involved populations. In this work, I have reanalyzed all publicly available mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome haplogroups in the American population using simple phylogenetic and phylogeographic methodologies. The results provide a genetic perspective opposed to the currently established model. The arrival of the American settlers occurred more than 30,000 years ago, preceding the LGM. As genomic studies have uncovered, at least two Asian populations contributed to the ancestry of the immigrant population. Low population density and climatic deterioration led to a long period of demographic eclipse, during which small bands of hunter-gatherers made long journeys in search of favorable niches. After the LGM, the climate improved, and demographic expansions occurred in multiple independent centers. The founding and expansion ages of the uniparental haplogroups indicate that these centers were in South America, particularly the Colombian isthmus, the Andean region, the Southern Cone, and the Amazon. Subsequent dispersals occurred in North America, one involving mitochondrial haplogroups A2, C1, and D1, but not B2, and another, of lesser magnitude, represented by the expansion of haplogroups C4c and X2a.

Physiology seeks to elucidate the intricate network of interactions that sustain life, which often span multiple organs, cell types, and timescales, but a major challenge lies in the inability to simultaneously record time-varying cellular activity throughout the entire body. We developed WHOLISTIC, a method to image second-timescale, time-varying intracellular dynamics across cell-types of the vertebrate body. By advancing and integrating volumetric fluorescence microscopy, machine learning, and pancellular transgenic expression of calcium sensors in transparent young Danio rerio (zebrafish) and adult Danionella, the method enables real-time recording of cellular dynamics across the organism. Calcium is a universal intracellular messenger, with a large array of cellular processes depending on changes in calcium concentration across varying time-scales, making it an ideal proxy of cellular activity. Using this platform to screen the dynamics of all cells in the body, we discovered unexpected responses of specific cell types to stimuli, such as chondrocyte reactions to cold, meningeal responses to ketamine, and state-dependent activity, such as oscillatory ependymal-cell activity during periods of extended motor quiescence. At the organ scale, the method uncovered pulsating traveling waves along the kidney nephron. At the multi-organ scale, we uncovered muscle synergies and independencies, as well as muscle-organ interactions. Integration with optogenetics allowed us to all-optically determine the causal direction of brain-body interactions. At the whole-organism scale, the method captured the rapid brainstem-controlled redistribution of blood flow across the body. Finally, we advanced Whole-Body Expansion Microscopy to provide ground-truth molecular and ultrastructural anatomical context, explaining the spatiotemporal structure of activity captured by WHOLISTIC.

Here, we formulate a simple analytic model derived from neural field theory that prioritizes physical constraints on connectome architecture by assuming that connectivity is preferentially concentrated between pairs of cortical locations that facilitate the excitation of resonant geometric modes of the cortex. We show that the model outperforms existing approaches in reproducing multiple topological and topographical properties of cortical connectomes mapped at spatial scales spanning orders of magnitude in humans, chimpanzees, macaques, marmosets, and mice, as mapped with either non-invasive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging or invasive viral tract-tracing.

We investigated whether transcription, a well-documented source of both DNA damage and repair in somatic tissues, is associated with sex differences in germline mutations. We used single-cell germline expression data from different stages of gametogenesis in males and females and phased de novo mutations from pedigrees. Focusing on protein-coding genes, we found no relationship between the male mutation rate and averaged gene expression levels during spermatogenesis despite evidence for transcription-asymmetry. Individual stages of spermatogenesis appear to vary in their contribution to mutation, however: expression levels in spermatogonial stem cells and sperm are significantly positively associated with paternal mutation rates, while those in primary spermatocytes are significantly negatively associated. Thus, transcription may have varying effects over male gametogenesis that are not visible from its cumulative effect on the total germline mutation rate. By contrast, the female mutation rate increases significantly with transcription levels averaged across different stages of folliculogenesis, with corresponding evidence for transcription-asymmetry. The difference between the sexes is also observed when using a smaller set of phased mutations from three-generation pedigrees and when relying on expression data from bulk gonadal tissues. These results indicate that transcription has distinct effects on the mutation rate in the two sexes, leading to more mutations in females but not males, in contrast to what one might expect from the overall paternal bias in germline mutations.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Theory of Mind (ToM) and discourse production deficits are well documented in schizophrenia (SZ), yet the neural basis of discourse-related ToM processes in ST remains unclear. This study investigated brain activation during narrative planning and production in individuals with schizotypal traits. Methods: Thirty young adults (mean age = 18.8 years) completed standardized assessments, including the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire Brief Revised (SPQBR), adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), depression (PHQ9), and dissociation (DESB). Participants performed a discourse task in an fMRI scanner, describing nine-panel cartoons requiring inference of character intentions. Behavioral discourse metrics included total and inferred events. fMRI analyses examined activation during planning and production phases, with SPQBR positive, negative, and disorganized traits entered as regressors. Results: Schizotypal traits correlated with multiple psychosocial risk factors, including elevated depression, ACEs, and dissociation (r = .48 .82, p < .01). During planning, canonical ToM/self-referential regions (vmPFC, precuneus, insula) were recruited. Positive traits correlated with increased activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, precuneus, and lingual gyrus, whereas disorganized traits were associated with reduced activation in the precuneus and lingual gyri. During production, networks spanning vmPFC, hippocampus, right TPJ, and basal ganglia were engaged. Negative traits correlated with increased motor/premotor activation, while disorganized traits correlated with reduced activation in lingual gyrus, SMA, and cerebellum.

Next, we used simultaneous two-photon imaging and optogenetics in mice to ask how these putative differences in connectivity lead to distinct network responses to brief, focal excitatory input to a short-timescale visual area, VISp, and a long-timescale frontal area, MOs. MOs neurons were more likely to respond to photostimulation of their neighbors. Moreover, the evoked dynamics of the overall network were much longer lasting in MOs than VISp, due to the more prevalent recruitment of late-responding neurons, which formed reliable activity sequences.

Here, we show that Xenopus wdr5 is expressed in blastula stem cells and enriched in neural crest cells during neurulation. Morpholino mediated depletion of wdr5 abolished neural crest marker expression both in embryos and in reprogrammed explants while unexpectedly expanding neural plate border and neural plate domains. Gain of function experiments revealed a striking dose-dependent effect: low levels of wdr5 enhanced neural crest formation, whereas high levels suppressed it, suggesting a requirement for precise stoichiometry with interacting partners. We identify myc as a critical cofactor for wdr5 in neural crest specification. wdr5 and myc physically interact in early embryos, and coexpression at defined ratios rescues neural crest formation while either, individually, is inhibitory. Domain specific mutagenesis showed that the WBM site of wdr5 is required for myc-dependent activation of neural crest genes, while the WIN site regulates myc expression itself; both domains are necessary to rescue wdr5 loss of function phenotypes. Moreover, modulation of myc levels phenocopied wdr5s dose-sensitive effects, reinforcing the importance of balanced wdr5/myc activity.

Variant classification can be challenging due to the lack of monogenic disease entity (MDE, defined as a gene-phenotype pair) specific variant classification recommendations. A key criterion for variant classification is disease allele frequency thresholds (DAFTs), which are not established for all MDEs recommended for the return of SF. Methods: We calculated DAFTs for SF MDEs considering prevalence, gene contribution, and penetrance. ACMG criterion BS1 was set at the calculated DAFT value, with BA1 set at ten times the calculated DAFT. For genes associated with multiple SF MDEs without clear genotype-phenotype correlation, DAFT values were combined. GnomAD Grpmax filtering allele frequencies (FAF) for pathogenic/likely pathogenic classified variants were compared to calculated thresholds. Results: We determined BS1 and BA1 values for 58 SF MDEs (47 genes). No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant Grpmax FAF was greater than the relevant MDE-specific BA1. Conclusion: Setting BA1 and BS1 thresholds should improve variant classification consistency and reduce misclassifications. For SF MDEs without current ClinGen Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) specifications, these frequency specifications can be used until full criteria are available.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

The disease is caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene leading to the production of the dominant-negative progerin isoform of the nuclear envelope protein lamin A. Disease severity and progression amongst the population of ~140 known patients is variable. Most of the mechanistic insights into the disease have come from studies using cellular or mouse models of HGPS. To probe the clinical relevance of previously implicated cellular pathways and to address the extent of gene expression heterogeneity between patients, we have performed transcriptomic analysis of a comprehensive set of HGPS patients. We find misexpression of several cellular pathways across the patient population, particularly of multiple signaling pathways as well as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and mesodermal cell fate specification. Variability amongst individual patients was limited, with misregulation of the major pathways observed in most patients. Comparing the transcriptome of patients with an inducible HGPS cell model, we distinguished immediate-early cellular response pathways from secondary adaptive pathways and identified mTORC1, the UPR, UV response, apoptosis and TNFalpha signaling via NF-kB as primary targets of the disease-causing progerin protein.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria pose a significant public health challenge, underscoring the urgent need for innovative antibacterial strategies. Bacteriophages (phages), viruses that specifically target bacteria, offer a promising alternative; however, bacterial immune defenses often limit their effectiveness. Developing small-molecule inhibitors of these defenses can facilitate mechanistic studies and serve as adjuvants to enhance phage therapy. Here, we identify novel inhibitors targeting the bacterial cyclic oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) effector Cap5. Cap5 is an HNH endonuclease activated by a cyclic nucleotide to degrade genomic DNA in virally infected cells, leading to cell death through abortive infection. Guided by the crystal structure of the Cap5 SAVED domain bound to its activating ligand, we performed structure-guided virtual screening to identify candidate inhibitors. Biochemical assays revealed that approximately 16% of the top docking hits exhibited inhibitory activity. Further cellular assays demonstrated that one potent compound could enter E. coli cells and inhibit Cap5 activity. Our integrated approach--combining structure-based virtual screening with biochemical validation--provides a robust framework for discovering small-molecule inhibitors of bacterial immune defenses to advance adjunctive therapies and deepen our understanding of phage-bacteria interactions.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

In vitro, such interactions drive RNA to self-assemble into aggregates. This raises a fundamental unanswered question: within a confined cellular volume at physiological mRNA abundances, how much aggregation would arise from sequence-encoded chemistry alone? Here, we establish this baseline with large-scale kinetic simulations of the E. coli transcriptome. Our simulations reveal that sequence-encoded base-pairing energetics is sufficient to generate a dynamic network of large aggregates, organized by long, multivalent mRNA hubs. Strikingly, evolutionary analysis shows that native E. coli sequences exhibit clear signatures of selection to counteract this propensity: they fold more stably, minimize unstructured regions, and form weaker intermolecular contacts than dinucleotide-preserving controls. These findings demonstrate that maintaining transcriptome solubility has been a significant, previously unrecognized constraint shaping genome evolution, and provide a new lens to interpret cellular RNA management.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have found that miRNAs and other components involved in PTGS are abundantly present in the nucleus of the cells, where they also play important roles in gene regulation. However, the understanding of their function in the nucleus is not well characterized, particularly in response to cellular stress. We conducted nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation of primary human endothelial cells (ECs) to assess the distribution of miRNAs during hypoxia. The onset of hypoxia led to changes in miRNA expression in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Notably, a larger proportion of deregulated miRNAs were identified in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm upon hypoxia exposure. We focused on these nuclear-enriched, differentially expressed miRNAs to investigate their cellular functions and their effects on target mRNAs in different compartments. The data indicated a more pronounced alteration in nuclear mRNA expression compared to cytoplasmic expression, pointing towards a nuclear-specific role for these miRNAs. Several miRNAs influenced target mRNAs associated with pathways of cell proliferation and inflammation. Functional assays under hypoxia showed that miR-5091 and miR-7974 reduced EC cell proliferation, while miR-1246 increased it. Additionally, miR-3662 was found to regulate the secretion levels of specific cytokines, impacting the inflammatory response. Overall, our findings highlight the significant role of miRNAs in the nuclear compartment of ECs in modulating the hypoxic response and provide insights into their multifaceted functions.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Background Synapse function is critical for cognition, and synapse loss is highly correlated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Tau oligomers, which accumulate in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, can acutely inhibit synaptic plasticity and cause synapse loss. Coordinated presynaptic and postsynaptic function is essential for effective synaptic transmission, and both compartments can be dysregulated by pathogenic tau. However, the series of pathophysiological events triggered by tau oligomers to cause the dysfunction and deterioration of presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic sites remain unclear. Methods We developed a proximity labeling tool to map the postsynaptic proteome by fusing PSD-95 with APEX2 (APEX2-PSD-95) which was expressed in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. We used APEX2-PSD-95 to map the dynamic changes in the postsynaptic proteome with precise temporal resolution after an acute exposure of human iPSC-derived neurons to recombinant tau oligomers for 30 min. Leveraging immunocytochemistry, electrophysiology and electron microscopy, we further delineated the impact of the acute tau oligomer exposure on presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments over time for up to 14 days. Results The brief exposure of human iPSC-derived neurons to tau oligomers caused a progressive deterioration of synapses, marked by both presynaptic and postsynaptic dysregulation. Postsynaptic proteome mapping revealed an immediate tau oligomer-triggered downregulation of the postsynaptic actin motor proteins Myosin-Va and Myosin-10, which coincided with impaired AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking during synaptic plasticity. This was followed 24 hours later by the upregulation of disease-related proteins, including GSK3B; at postsynaptic sites. The loss of PSD-95-labeled postsynaptic sites at 7 days after tau oligomer exposure preceded the loss of Synapsin-labeled presynaptic terminals at 14 days. The postsynaptic sites that remained exhibited a long-term downregulation of postsynaptic AMPAR levels and sustained synaptic plasticity impairment. Moreover, the remaining presynaptic terminals contained less clusters of vesicles at the presynaptic active zone which was associated with reduced vesicle release probability at synapses. Conclusion Our findings reveal the series of events underlying tau oligomer-induced bipartite synapse deterioration. The progressive decline of synapses involves the emergence of two synapse fates. One synapse fate involves the persistent weakening of both presynaptic and postsynaptic function, and the other results in synaptic loss.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Scanning in soccer is a foundational behavior that enables players to explore their environment, supporting rapid and accurate decision-making. However, since most previous studies have focused on head movements, the coordination structure of gaze shifts, including the ocular contribution, is insufficiently understood. This study aimed to determine the coordinated roles of the eye and head during scanning. Twenty male collegiate soccer players performed a passing task paired with video-based situational judgments while eye and head movements were recorded by a 200 Hz sampling rate using an eye tracker system with a built-in gyroscope. We detected eye and head velocities and amplitudes during rapid gaze shifts. As a result, peak eye velocity was significantly higher than peak head velocity (d = 4.09, p < .001). The cross-correlation (CC) between gaze and eye velocities (0.98) was significantly greater than that between gaze and head velocities (0.90). These results indicate that gaze shifts were driven primarily by eye movements rather than head movements. Furthermore, eye and head velocities were negatively correlated (r = -.60, p = .005), whereas their velocity-control profiles (mean velocity normalized by amplitude) were positively correlated (r = .90, p < .001), indicating individual strategy-dependent allocation of effort while preserving control capability of eye and head movements. Our findings provide a characterization of the eye-head coordination structure of gaze shifts in soccer scanning, suggesting the need for comprehensive assessments beyond head-motion metrics alone.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

We found that easy-to-hard sequential training improved generalization in both humans and ANNs. However, when easy and hard conditions were interleaved, humans and ANNs showed different behaviors: while ANNs performed worse than with sequential training, humans maintained good performance but with large inter-individual variability. Investigating ANN models trained with different curricula, we demonstrated that models relying on low-dimensional neural populations showed superior generalization.

The application of artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) to MRI can be a powerful tool to streamline clinical decision-making, yet variability amongst MRI sequences and algorithms have hindered appropriate assessment of reliability and generalizability. Methods. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the ability of current AI/ML models operating on MRI data for: 1) epilepsy diagnosis, 2) temporal lobe epilepsy lateralization, 3) lesion localization, and 4) post-surgical outcome prediction. Searches were conducted across PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases from inception until January 1, 2025. We selected studies that employed AI/ML models trained on any MRI modality to classify at least ten patients across the four main objectives for qualitative assessment, and further included in the meta-analysis if they reported an accuracy rate. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was the overall accuracy of AI/ML models trained on MRI data. The secondary outcome was the concomitant risk of bias evaluation using PROBAST. Results. We identified 158 studies for qualitative evaluation and 127 studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. AI/ML on multimodal MRI could accurately distinguish epilepsy patients from healthy controls (overall accuracy: 88% [85-90]), lateralize temporal lobe epilepsy (90% [87-93]), localize epileptogenic lesions (82% [74-88]), and predict post-surgical seizure-freedom (83% [78-87]). Overall, a high risk of bias remains in the literature; participant bias remained high across all outcomes (64-87%), as well as predictor (88-100%) and analysis (83-100%) bias. Outcome bias was low only for AI/ML studies predicting post-surgical outcomes. Conclusion. Our results support promising accuracy of AI/ML models in epilepsy diagnostics and prognostics but remain highly susceptible to bias in participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis domains which limits current translation to routine clinical practice.

We investigated whether thalamic blood flow, a marker of metabolism, differs between children with SeLECTS and controls, and examined the effects of spike distribution and antiseizure medications (ASMs) on thalamic perfusion. In this retrospective cohort study, we identified consecutive children with SeLECTS who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for epilepsy evaluation (n = 44) and age- and sex-matched children who underwent MRI for non-epilepsy indications (n = 35). We quantified thalamic blood flow via manual segmentation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) sequences obtained from arterial spin labeling MRI. Clinical variables including sedation use during MRI, daily ASM use, and spike distribution (unilateral or bilateral) were extracted from medical records. Children with SeLECTS demonstrated elevated thalamic blood flow compared to controls, with the most pronounced differences in specific subgroups. Children with unilateral spikes showed the highest CBF, particularly in the thalamus contralateral to spike activity. ASM use significantly modulated thalamic blood flow: children taking oxcarbazepine showed the highest CBF, while those on levetiracetam had CBF similar to controls. Unmedicated children showed intermediate elevations. These findings demonstrate that elevated thalamic blood flow may be intrinsic to SeLECTS pathophysiology, with different ASMs producing distinct neurobiological effects. The differential medication effects may relate to their clinical efficacy and provide neurobiological rationale for treatment selection in this common childhood epilepsy syndrome.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Moreover, population stressors act at different spatial scales, and the understanding of variation in outcomes for species will depend on their dispersal ability. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit metapopulation simulation to investigate how stressors that act at different spatial scales interact with landscape composition and dispersal behavior to drive patterns of metapopulation extirpations. We are particularly interested in gaining insight into the decline of not only range-limited species, but also widespread butterflies that have been reported in recent years, contrary to conventional wisdom about traits that make species more at risk of population decline. We found that stressors acting at different spatial scales interact with dispersal, especially in highly developed landscapes. On average, being less dispersive produces worse outcomes because more dispersive species benefit from semi-natural habitats, which can strengthen connections between source populations. At the same time, it is the degradation of these types of land in particular that may disproportionately impact dispersive species. These findings enhance our understanding of insect biodiversity loss and demonstrate that the conservation of widespread insects will likely require consideration of larger-scale landscape connectivity.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Multiple depths of coverage, k values, and k-mer-based tools for genome size estimation were explored. A 2.3-fold genome size difference was found between the two species, ranging from 2.35 to 2.80 Gb ([x] = 2.58 Gb) for E. anisatum and from 0.99 to 1.24 Gb ([x] = 1.11 Gb) for E. marmoratum. Both species were identified as diploid with no evidence of strict partial endoreplication. The most important aspects to be taken into account to improve genome size estimation were heterozygosity, depth of coverage, and the maximum k-mer coverage. The genomes of both species were found to be highly repetitive (63--73%) and heavily dominated by Ty3-gypsy retrotransposons, particularly those of the Ogre family. Additionally, the genome of E. anisatum was characterized by the presence of a 172 bp satellite (AniS1), which represented 11% of the genome size.

Higher cardiac fibrosis with intracardiac fat accumulation correlated with reduced diastolic function. Mice depleted of platelet TGFb1 (TGFb1Platelet-Tg26), or treated with atorvastatin, were partially protected from HIV- and ART-induced cardiac fibrosis, steatosis, and diastolic dysfunction. Atorvastatin effects occurred independently of changes in inflammatory cytokines and total cholesterol. They correlated with reduced platelet activation and TGFb1 signaling in cardiac endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages undergoing mesenchymal transition. These results indicate that certain ART regimens accelerate HIV-associated CVD characterized by HFpEF via platelet TGFb1-dependent processes and mitigated by atorvastatin. They enhance understanding of the pleiotropic effects of statins in HIV-ART CVD and suggest a mechanism that might be targeted by antiplatelet agents or inhibition of TGFb signaling.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Sinorhizobium meliloti, whose plant hosts Medicago truncatula and M. sativa express ca. 600 NCR peptides during root nodule development, possesses a symbiotically essential BacASm protein that imports certain NCR peptides into the cytoplasm. This import permits proteolytic degradation of the NCR peptides, thereby protecting the endocytosed bacteria from their antimicrobial peptide-like lethality, while also allowing certain NCR peptides to undergo their symbiotically critical interactions with cytoplasmic components, for example heme-sequestration in the case of NCR247. BacA's Escherichia coli ortholog SbmAEc can restore a wildtype phenotype to a {Delta}bacASm mutant. Our study employed 54 S. meliloti bacASm missense mutants (35 to cysteine and 19 to glycine) that we tested for protein production, ability to establish a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, and their susceptibility to killing by higher levels of the NCR247 and the Bac7(1-35) peptides. We also used the Single Cysteine Accessibility Method to make topological inferences. Our detailed genetic, biochemical, structural, and physiological analyses have revealed that BacASm and SbmA homodimers function as finely tuned import machines, whose structures can be relatively easily disrupted by single amino acid changes. Our discovery that several mutations that differentially separate nitrogen-fixation, NCR247 import, and Bac7(1-35) import map to the lining of the peptide-binding cavity in the outward-open SbmA/BacA conformation suggests a molecular explanation the other otherwise paradoxical observation that SbmA/BacAs from pathogens can fully replace BacASm, whereas BacAs from other rhizobia cannot.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Lipid remodeling is a key but poorly understood feature of this state. Here, we apply hyperspectral Raman microscopy to visualize lipid accumulation and fatty acid metabolism in senescent human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cells. Senescence was induced by Doxorubicin treatment and validated by morphology, p21 expression, and senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity. Raman imaging revealed progressive enrichment of CH2 stretching signals at 2850 cm-1 across 10-25 days post-treatment. Principal component analysis (PCA) distinguished proliferating and senescent cells with variance explained largely by lipid vibrational modes, including CH2 scissoring (1445 cm-1), C=C stretching (1655 cm-1), and CH2 stretching (2850 cm-1), indicating a marked compositional transition between 15 and 18 days of senescence. To probe functional lipid metabolism, we employed deuterated arachidonic acid (AA-d8), which displays unique (C=C)-D stretching peaks at 2220 and 2254 cm-1 within the silent Raman region. In vitro assays confirmed that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) metabolism of AA-d8 leads to a time-dependent reduction of these peaks relative to lipid signals. In senescent MCF7 cells, AA-d8 accumulated perinuclearly and showed heterogeneous distribution. Withdrawal of the COX2 inhibitor Cay-10404 resulted in a progressive decrease of the (C=C)-D peaks normalized to total lipids, consistent with intracellular arachidonic acid metabolism. Together, these results establish hyperspectral Raman microscopy as a label-free platform to resolve senescence-associated lipid remodeling and metabolic heterogeneity. By enabling spatial and temporal detection of fatty acid metabolism, this approach provides a powerful tool for dissecting senescence biology and supports future strategies to identify, monitor, and target senescent cells in disease and aging contexts.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we tested the activity of Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli RNase HII on all four canonical, mismatched, and damaged rNMPs. We show that E. coli RNase HII is adept at incising most rNMP variants from DNA at similar frequencies, with the exception of an oxidized rNMP, where endoribonuclease activity is sharply reduced. In contrast, B. subtilis RNase HII efficiently incised rAMP, rCMP, and rUMP, but was inefficient at processing rGMP in both a canonical and mismatched base pair. We tested damaged ribonucleotides and found that B. subtilis RNase HII is refractory to processing abasic and oxidized ribonucleotide lesions. Our work shows that bacterial RNase HII enzymes have different intrinsic endoribonuclease activity toward the repair of canonical, mismatched, and damaged rNMPs, demonstrating that not all rNMP errors provoke efficient resolution. Our finding that B. subtilis RNase HII is recalcitrant to repairing damaged rNMPs resembles what is observed for eukaryotic RNase H2 orthologs, suggesting that other repair processes are necessary to resolve damaged rNMPs.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

J.; Claing, A.", "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play a pivotal role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Traditionally viewed as contractile cells that maintain vascular tone and structure, VSMCs undergo phenotypic switching in response to atherogenic stimuli, such as high circulating levels of LDL, thus adopting synthetic, osteogenic, or macrophage-like phenotypes. This plasticity contributes to plaque formation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and inflammatory signaling. We have previously shown that ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTP-binding protein, regulates the expression and function of actin, which is important for maintaining the contractile phenotype of VSMCs. However, the role of ARF6 in phenotypic switching remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that ARF6 knockdown in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) reduced lipid uptake through alterations in the expression of scavenger receptors (LOX-1, MSR1), cytokine production (IL-6) as well as modulation of inflammatory markers and pathways (adhesion molecules, PI3K, NFkB, p38). To confirm our findings in an in vivo setting, we engineered a novel conditional smooth muscle cell-specific ARF6 KO mouse in an atheroprone background (Acta2-Cre-ERT2+/-/ApoE-/-/Arf6f/f mice). Mice were fed a high-fat diet to accelerate plaque formation. ARF6 knockout resulted in a significant reduction of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch, which was associated with a reduction of collagen and foam cells. Furthermore, we observed that ARF6 regulates the expression of inflammatory markers. These findings highlight the importance of ARF6 expression in VSMCs and its role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Blood was collected at baseline before surgery (T0) and at 2h (T1), 24-48h (T2), and 72-96h (T3) after surgical initiation. High-resolution metabolomics (LC-MS) was integrated with continuous glucose monitoring and inflammatory/cardiac biomarkers. At T0, several pathways were associated with subsequent SH, including bile acid metabolism, the carnitine shuttle, and fatty-acid oxidation, suggesting preoperative metabolic susceptibility. In longitudinal analyses, participants who developed SH showed coordinated postoperative changes with significant enrichment of pathways not evident at baseline, C21-steroid hormone biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and glycosphingolipid (ceramide) metabolism, consistent with lipid remodeling and inflammatory signaling during surgical stress. Individuals with SH also exhibited higher inflammatory biomarker levels (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor). A machine-learning model using early metabolomic features predicted SH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86.

F.", "abstract": "Cell and gene-modified cell therapy (CGT), commonly referred to as the fourth pillar of cancer treatment, includes creating advanced cancer killing cells ex vivo and then subsequently putting them into the patient to selectively attack cancerous cells. Typically, immune cells from a patient are removed, genetically modified to find and kill cancer, grown to a large army of cancer killing cells, and put back into the patient. This complex process is being simplified through innovation, some of which we describe here. One key innovation is an immune cell manufacturing device configuration called G-Rex (for gas permeable rapid expansion), which is now widely used to create armies of cancer killing cells for clinical trials and for commercially approved drug products on a worldwide basis. G-Rex is uniquely simple and popular because it is the only technology that eliminates the need for pumps and flow circuits to deliver oxygen and nutrients. Instead, the material and geometry of G-Rex allow cancer killing cells to get access to oxygen and nutrients on demand. This greatly minimizes complexity and sets the stage for high throughput manufacturing. To further simplify G-Rex relative to all CGT drug product manufacturing alternatives, it would be ideal to eliminate any need of physical intervention to assess cell quantity. With that goal, we conceived a novel approach to determining cell quantity in a non-invasive manner. More specifically, we invented and built a sensor into G-Rex that continuously reports the quantity of cells in G-Rex without any intervention or sampling to an external reader. Herein, we call the sensor a single-use metabolite absorbing resonant transducer in G-Rex (SMART G-Rex) and the reader a SMART Reader. The SMART G-Rex is wirelessly interrogated by the SMART Reader to determine the extent of cell expansion in the G-Rex at any given time. More specifically, as cell quantity increases, the SMART G-Rex absorbs cell secreted metabolites (organic compounds such as eicosanoids) which cause a change in resonant frequency (measured as % of frequency change, or Skroot Growth Index (SGI)). By placing SMART G-Rex in proximity of the SMART Reader, whether in or out of an incubator, changes in resonant frequency are detected and translated into cell quantity with high reliability. For example, using 45 sensors across multiple donor cell samples, we established 99% confidence in SMART accuracy at signaling a >60X expansion (3B cells at harvest). The SMART G-Rex provides a non-invasive way of instantly quantifying the number of cells in a CGT drug production process and informing manufacturers when a CGT drug product has reached the desired quantity of cells necessary to proceed with formulation, fill, and finish. By integrating SMART technology, G-Rex is the only technology for CGT manufacturing that can avoid intervention when determining cells quantity or allow real-time knowledge of cell quantity.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a novel helmet safety technology, the Release Layer System (RLS), designed to enhance conventional helmets and reduce the likelihood of such injuries. RLS is located on the outer side of the helmet and thus, gets impacted first. The force of the impact activates a rolling mechanism triggering the release of an outer polycarbonate panel, thereby dispersing and transforming a substantial portion of the incident rotational energy. To evaluate the effectiveness of the technology, we conducted oblique impact tests on three popular helmet types, each in conventional and RLS-equipped configurations, tested on three impact locations and using two headforms. RLS-equipped helmets reduced Peak Angular Velocity (PAV) by 57-66%, averaged across impact locations, compared to their conventional counterparts. This corresponds to a 68-86% reduction in the probability of an AIS2+ brain injury, as estimated by the Brain Injury Criterion. The most notable improvement was observed at the pYrot location (frontal, on-axis impacts), with up to 85\\% PAV reduction. Testing across headforms further demonstrated the effectiveness of the technology in mitigating head rotation irrespective of variations in evaluation setups. This work introduces a novel mechanism for rotational impact mitigation and provides evidence of its potential benefits compared with conventional helmets.

First, we parameterize the SE(3) rigid body transformation using Lie algebra, ensuring a continuous and singularity-free optimization landscape suitable for gradient descent. Second, we treat the mobile and target density maps as probability distributions on a 3D grid and measure their similarity using an Optimal Transport (OT) score based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Third, to make this computationally feasible for large maps, we leverage the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to accelerate the core convolution operations within the Sinkhorn iterations from O(N2) to O(NlogN).

Alignment-based approaches such as BLAST and profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used to infer homology and transfer annotation to be subsequently confirmed by experiments. The ability of BLASTp to distinguish orthologs from paralogs varies across protein families; for profile HMMs, this depends on the sequences considered for generating multiple sequence alignments. In this study, we systematically evaluated the performance of BLASTp and HMM-based methods for fine-grained function annotation using carefully curated protein datasets that are diverse in sequence-structure-function relationships. Expectedly, BLASTp performed well in detecting close homologs but failed to detect remote homologs. BLASTp detected homology between 22.6\\% and 100\\% of sequence pairs within different homologous protein families. The extent of sequence identity between trypsin and chymotrypsin sequences is high despite differences in fine-grained molecular function. Transferring function annotation based on homology inferred from BLASTp leads to errors in trypsin-chymotrypsin-like situations. Profile HMMs improved sensitivity and captured subtle homology signals even when sequence identity was low, though some known family members scored below threshold due to functional divergence or mutations at catalytic sites. We further showed that relying solely on homology for annotation transfer can lead to misleading conclusions when proteins have evolved divergent functions despite structural similarity. Our findings highlight that a cautious approach involving BLASTp, profile HMMs, and expert domain knowledge provides the most reliable strategy for functional annotation.

Whether the same processes support learning in a small mirror reversal (MR), where feedback is reflected across the body midline, remains unknown. To address this gap, we asked whether implicit processes contribute to learning in a small MR. Forty-two right-handed participants reached to targets located 10{degrees} to the left and right of body midline using a Kinarm exoskeleton robot. Half of the participants experienced a VR distortion (VR group), which consisted of a 20{degrees} clockwise or counterclockwise cursor rotation. The remaining participants experienced a 20{degrees} MR distortion (MR group), where cursor feedback was reflected across body midline (y-axis). Following reaches with a VR or MR distortion, participants completed assessment trials in which they reached in the absence of cursor feedback to assess implicit learning. Analysis of angular errors (AE) revealed that all participants in the VR group learned to reach with the VR distortion, however, only 55% of MR participants learned to reach with the MR distortion. AEs on the no-cursor trials revealed that only the VR group engaged in implicit learning. These findings demonstrate that MR learning, even when small MR distortions are introduced, is not supported by implicit learning. The absence of implicit learning in MR provides evidence that MR is a different form of learning (i.e., skill acquisition) compared to VR learning (i.e., motor adaptation).", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

The rising of obesity and non viral liver disease associated HCC further limits the effectiveness of conventional screening approaches such as ultrasonography and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) testing. In this context, the identification of potential effective biomarkers for rapid and precise diagnosis of HCC still represents an extremely important task. Here, we identify ADAMTS3 as a novel mechanistic serum biomarker for HCC that addresses this shifting etiological landscape. Transcriptome analysis of four independent cohorts, including HCC patients, individuals with obesity or non viral liver disease, and healthy controls, reveals four secreted proteins associated with HCC progression. Among them, ADAMTS3 demonstrates strong diagnostic performance by ROC (receiver operating characteristic) and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) analysis. High ADAMTS3 expression correlates with aggressive molecular signature, characterized by enhanced proliferative signaling, suppressed immune effector responses, and a reprogrammed immune microenvironment marked by reduced NK cell infiltration and increased accumulation of immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages, driven by extracellular matrix stiffening. Knockdown of ADAMTS3 in cell lines significantly reduced proliferation, and clonogenic potential. Reintroduction of ADAMTS3 partially rescued both phenotypes, further confirming its role in promoting HCC cell growth. Optical tweezer based measurements further reveal reduced cell stiffness upon ADAMTS3 deficiency, highlighting its role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Finally, to provide a simple strategy for HCC diagnosis based on this novel biomarker, we demonstrated a DNA origami based SERS biosensor capable of detecting ADAMTS3 at pM level. Together, these findings identify ADAMTS3 as a mechanistic biomarker and demonstrate a translational sensing strategy for non-invasive HCC early screening.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Personalized cancer therapies focus mostly on targeting driver alterations, such as oncogenic point mutations or oncogenic driver events within large somatic copy number alterations. However, these alterations are often not actionable or only present in a small subset of patients. We hypothesized that passenger events, specifically in amplified regions, could be therapeutically exploited by providing actionable molecules on the cell surface, serving as Trojan horses for specific therapy delivery. Applying a multiomics in silico approach, we identified MPZL1 (Myelin protein zero-like 1), a glycosylated cell surface receptor located on chromosome 1q, as a promising candidate, which is amplified in up to 75% of cases in several solid cancers. Notably, immunohistochemistry of a wide range of human cancer tissues (n=2244 samples) as well as normal tissues revealed strong membranous MPZL1 expression in a majority of solid tumors (e.g. 48% of hepatocellular carcinomas or 89% of triple-negative breast cancers), whereas healthy tissues were mostly negative or just faintly positive for MPZL1. Next, we generated a highly specific monoclonal antibody directed to the extracellular domain of human MPZL1 protein and utilized this antibody to produce MPZL1 CAR-T cells. MPZL1 CAR-T cells showed high specificity as well as high sensitivity in targeting a multitude of human cancer cell lines (e.g. liver, breast, and lung cancer) with high MPZL1 expression in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate strong therapeutic efficiency of MPZL1 CAR-T cells not only in different human xenograft tumors in vivo but also in a unique autochthonous liver cancer mouse model. Our work provides a framework to target passenger events within large chromosomal amplifications, reveals MPZL1 as a new trojan horse entry point for therapies of 1q-amplified cancers, and as such opens a new avenue for innovative approaches in anti-cancer drug development.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Notably, the majority of approved immunotherapies do not target antigen processing and presentation, which are key steps in the development of immune responses and harbor potential as targets to improve immunotherapy. Here, we demonstrate that breast tumors induce locoregional lymph node impairment in antigen presentation-but not in antigen processing-which limits anti-cancer antigen-specific T cell responses. Inhibition of the locoregional T cell response was due to a tumor-mediated reduction of the cytokine IL1{beta} in tumor draining lymph nodes, which impaired antigen presentation. Further, we tested the ability of dendritic cells in lymph nodes at various distances from the primary tumor to be activated utilizing an antigen-agnostic adjuvant delivery strategy. We observed improved anti-tumor T cell responses when the adjuvant was delivered to cancer antigen-positive lymph nodes distant from the tumor, suggesting these lymph nodes can be targeted to improve anti-cancer immune responses. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade, delivery of the adjuvant to distant lymph nodes led to long-term survival and protection from recurrence. Antigen presentation and T cell responses could also be recovered by exogenous delivery of IL1{beta} via intratumoral injection, with improved survival when combined with immune checkpoint blockade. Our study demonstrates that tumor-induced locoregional impairment of antigen presentation can be overcome by the appropriate introduction of immunological adjuvant to tumor-distant lymph nodes or by restoring IL1{beta} to the tumor-draining lymph node. These strategies can induce high-quality, durable immune responses and have clinical implications for expanding the efficacy of immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

G.; Powers, J.; Njiru, A.; Ansari, Z.; Woappi, Y.", "abstract": "Cancer cell evasion of therapy is a highly adaptive process that undermines the efficacy of many treatment strategies. A significant milestone in the study of these mechanisms has been the advent of pooled CRISPR knockout screens, which enable high-throughput, genome-wide interrogations of tumor dependencies and synthetic lethal interactions, advancing our understanding of how cancer cells adapt to and evade therapies. However, the utility of this approach diminishes when applied to dynamic biological contexts, where processes are transient and sensitivity to routine cell culture manipulations that introduce noise and limit meaningful discoveries. To overcome these limitations, we present RESTRICT-seq, a next-generation pooled screening methodology that restricts Cas9 nuclear activation in controlled, repeated cycles. By confining Cas9 catalytic activity to strict temporal windows, RESTRICT-seq mitigates undesired fitness penalties that routinely accumulate throughout pooled screens. When benchmarked against conventional pooled screens and standard inducible protocols, RESTRICT-seq revealed significantly fewer divergent cell clones and increased signal-to-noise ratio, overcoming a key limitation of traditional methods. Leveraging RESTRICT-seq, we conducted a comprehensive functional survey of the druggable mammalian epigenome, uncovering several elusive epigenetic drivers of treatment resistance in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). This revealed PAK1 as a previously unrecognized mediator of cSCC resistance in human and mouse SCC, offering new insights into a prognostic marker and therapeutic target of high clinical significance. Our findings establish RESTRICT-seq as a powerful tool for extending the applicability of pooled CRISPR screens to dynamic and previously intractable biological contexts.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Therefore, studying this cell subpopulation is critical to identify new disease targets that can better the outcomes of AML/MDS patients. The use of RNAi and genetic approaches is technically challenging in primary leukemia cells and particularly LSPCs. Overcoming this technical hurdle could greatly expand the breath of pre-clinical and mechanistic examination of LSPCs. In this study, we describe a methodology to efficiently introduce siRNA, resulting in effective gene knock down in LSPCs. After isolation of LSPCs from primary patient samples, we showed that electroporation of these cells does not affect cell viability significantly. Further, using siGLO green transfection indicator, we show that RNA is introduced into the nucleus of these cells. siRNA transfection leads to efficient knockdown of target genes and has subsequent biological relevant activity.

We evaluated the feasibility and intestinal sparing potential of FLASH irradiation using a clinical synchrocyclotron-based proton therapy system generating a pulsed beam. Material and methods C57BL/6J mice received abdominal irradiation (2*2 cm) in transmission mode at FLASH (>60 Gy/s) or conventional (CONV, 0.5 Gy/s) dose rates using a 230 MeV superconducting synchrocyclotron proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) system. Two independent irradiation rounds were performed. Endpoints included 75-day survival, regenerating crypt counts, whole blood counts at day 4, and intestinal wall thickness, cyst-like structures, and cytokine levels at day 75. Results In the first irradiation round, survival after 14.5 Gy FLASH was markedly improved (5/8 survivors) compared to CONV (0/8), whereas in the second round survival rates were identical (2/7 per group). Overall, pooled data indicated improved survival with 14.5 Gy FLASH. The LD50 was 13.74 Gy in CONV and 14.48 Gy in FLASH mode, corresponding to a FLASH modifying factor of 0.95. FLASH at 14.5 Gy increased regenerating crypt numbers compared to CONV, but only in the first round, supporting survival outcomes. No significant differences were observed in whole blood counts, cytokine profiles, or long-term intestinal structural changes between groups. Conclusion FLASH proton therapy delivered with a clinical synchrocyclotron PBS system can reduce short-term gastrointestinal toxicity in mice.

While pyridoxine is the established antidote, its limited availability in emergency settings necessitates alternative treatments. This study aimed to evaluate the anticonvulsant efficacy of propofol, a GABA A receptor agonist and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, compared to pyridoxine and diazepam in isoniazid-induced seizures in mice. Methods: Thirty-two Swiss albino mice were pretreated with: (1) normal saline (10 mL/kg), (2) pyridoxine (300 mg/kg), (3) propofol (50 mg/kg), or (4) diazepam (2.5 mg/kg), followed by isoniazid (300 mg/kg) after 30 minutes. All drugs were administered intraperitoneally. Seizure latency, duration, time to death, and survival were monitored for 120 minutes. Outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier/log-rank tests and ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test. Results: Isoniazid induced seizures and 100% mortality in the control group. Pyridoxine did not prevent seizures or improve survival (8/8 seizures and deaths). Propofol failed to improve seizure frequency, latency, duration, mortality, or time to death (8/8 seizures and deaths). Diazepam significantly reduced seizure frequency and mortality to 1 of 8 mice (p < 0.001), and delayed seizure onset. Conclusion: Pretreatment with either propofol or pyridoxine failed to protect against isoniazid-induced seizures and death in mice. In contrast, diazepam was effective in preventing both seizures and death.

Analysis of mutant structures capturing intermediate activated states reveals no large domain shifts despite high temperature dependence, only subtle interfacial changes between domains. Both mutation and heat treatment consistently impact a critical network of thermolabile \"latch\" interactions along the S6-TRP helix-proximal N-terminus axis, driving receptor activation from a stable closed structure to progressively decoupled states and eventual disintegration.

While exercise offers significant benefits, it seems to be insufficient to completely reverse these changes. The mechanisms by which exercise conveys the effects throughout the body are still poorly understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released into circulation during exercise. EVs carry small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRs), which are proposed as mediators of the effects of exercise. We have previously shown that the miR response to acute exercise of EVs and HDL is diminished in postmenopausal women with low estrogen levels, which we were able to replicate here also in a rat model. In this study, we examined the effect of loss of ovarian hormones and acute exercise in the sRNA cargo of EV and HDL particles in female rats. We show for the first time that loss of ovarian hormones affects specifically the nucleic acid cargo of circulating EVs. We further show that the estrogen responsive miRs regulate anaerobic glycolytic pathway in skeletal muscle.

While the FDA-endorsed toxin ATX-II has been widely used to model INaL-associated arrhythmogenesis, it lacks selectivity, limiting its utility in dissecting the roles of individual Nav channel subtypes. This study investigates the proarrhythmic impact of TTX-S Nav channel activation using AaH-II*, a scorpion venom-derived peptide with selective efficacy for TTX-S channels. Methods and Results: Using automated patch-clamp recordings, we characterized AaH-II* selectivity across human Nav isoforms and demonstrated potent, preferential activation of INaL in hNav1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.6 over the TTX-resistant cardiac isoform hNav1.5. Calcium imaging in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes showed that low nanomolar concentrations of AaH-II* induced spontaneous calcium release events and arrhythmogenic calcium transients, even in the absence of Nav1.5 activation. Ex vivo multielectrode array recordings in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts confirmed dose-dependent ventricular conduction slowing, prolonged repolarization, and increased arrhythmia burden, all mitigated by TTX. In vivo, intravenous AaH-II* administration in rats elicited QTc prolongation, atrioventricular block, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, which were significantly suppressed by TTX pretreatment. Conclusion: We identify AaH-II* as a powerful and selective tool to study INaL from TTX-S Nav channels in cardiac tissue. Our findings reveal that TTX-S channel-mediated INaL alone is sufficient to induce arrhythmias and that pharmacological inhibition of these channels offers a promising antiarrhythmic strategy.

Methods The literature search was done in April 2025 in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane. The inclusion criteria are randomized or non-randomized controlled trials and experimental repeated-measures studies that enrolled humans exposed to simulated microgravity for at least 24 hours. This study followed PRISMA (2020) guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO under CRD420251104161. Data was analyzed by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Results Ten studies, involving 152 participants, met the inclusion criteria. During exposure, the first effect was a decreased plasma volume, leading to hemoconcentration. Erythropoietin concentration decreased, while parameters dependent on plasma volume, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC count, falsely increased. Total hemoglobin mass and red cell volume showed a marked decrease, suggesting suppressed erythropoiesis. Iron status markers increased significantly, while classic hemolysis markers did not confirm increased hemolysis. Post-reambulation, erythropoietin rebounded, while the true decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC count were revealed as hemoconcentration resolved.

Additionally, Ip6k1-/- mice exhibit decreased serum albumin, elevated faecal protein, and reduced skeletal muscle mass compared to Ip6k1+/+ mice, suggestive of a deficiency in protein digestion in the absence of IP6K1. We found that IP6K1 is expressed throughout the mouse gastrointestinal tract, and is especially enriched in the cytoplasm of chief cells in the stomach, which are responsible for the storage and secretion of digestive enzymes. Pepsinogen C (PGC) containing granules were sparse, and gastric lipase F (LIPF) granules were completely absent in the gastric glands of Ip6k1-/- mice, despite normal expression levels of these enzymes, implicating IP6K1 in digestive enzyme granule biogenesis. Consequently, the level of the active protease pepsin C was decreased in the gastric lumen of Ip6k1-/- mice compared with their wild type counterparts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of IP6K1 in the gastric adenocarcinoma cell line AGS was able to recapitulate the phenotype of reduced PGC granule intensity seen in gastric chief cells of Ip6k1-/- mice.

Applying RE3DB, we found extensive reproductive enrichment: 284 F-box genes are preferentially expressed in mature anthers. Comparative transcriptomics across nine male-sterile rice mutants identified 111 F-box genes significantly downregulated in at least one mutant (log2 fold change < -1), resolving distinct co-regulation clusters.

We identified mutants in the Medicago truncatula SOBIR1 gene, known to be involved in innate immune response in multiple plants. We examined nodulation with multiple strains and species of Sinorhizobium and examined mycorrhizal interactions with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus versiforme (recently renamed Diversispora epigaea). Plants containing mutations in SOBIR1 exhibit normal nodulation with strains of S. meliloti, but fewer nodules when inoculated with S. medicae strains. The S. medicae nodules show evidence of accumulation of polyphenolic compounds, and abnormal arrangement of the rhizobia within the nodules. In contrast, when inoculated with Glomus versiforme. M. truncatula sobir1 mutant plants have increased mycorrhizal colonization and arbuscule number compared to the wild type. We localized a tagged SOBIR1 protein to the periarbuscular membrane interface. Together the data suggest the immune kinase SOBIR1 is involved in both nodulation and mycorrhizal interactions, but the effects of mutation differ.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we systematically quantify protein synthesis and clearance rates across over 4,200 cells from a primary tissue. Through integration with single-cell transcriptomics, we report the first quantitative analysis of how individual cell types regulate their proteomes across the continuum of gene expression. Our analysis quantifies the relative contributions of RNA abundance, translation, and protein clearance to the abundance variation of thousands of proteins. These results reveal an putative organizing principle: The contributions of both translation and protein clearance are linearly dependent on the cell growth rate. Further, we find that some proteins are primarily regulated by one mechanism (RNA abundance, translation, or clearance) across all cell types while the abundances of other proteins is dominated by different regulatory mechanisms across cell types. Our reliable multimodal measurements enabled quantifying and functionally interpreting molecular variation across single cells from the same cell type. The protein-protein correlations are substantially stronger than the mRNA-mRNA ones, which is mediated by protein clearance regulation. The protein-protein correlations are stronger not only for directly interacting proteins but also between functional sets of proteins. Further, these protein correlations allow identifying cell-type specific functional clusters. These clusters vary across cell types, revealing differences in metabolic processes coordination, partially mediated by protein clearance regulation. Our approach provides a scalable multiplexed framework for quantifying the regulatory processes shaping mammalian tissues and reveals organizing principles determining the relative contributions of translation and protein clearance to the proteomes of primary mammalian cells.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

For combinations of Esyn and gsyn, corresponding to an excitatory synapse, a supervised machine learning method for classification distinguishes the motifs perfectly with a score of 1.0 when using binned counts of postsynaptic spikes as the input. Strongly inhibitory combinations of these parameters result in no postsynaptic response in both types of microcircuit motifs; hence, the classifier does not improve upon a random assignment with a score of 0.5. In other domains of the parameter space spanned by Esyn and gsyn, corresponding to diminished excitation/inhibition, the classifier fails (0.5 < score < 1), indicating the challenge in identifying the nature of the synapse inferred exclusively from postsynaptic spikes.

The nucleus accumbens core (NAcore), a brain region critical for reward and aversion behaviors, undergoes structural and functional synaptic adaptations in response to chronic drug exposure. These changes, particularly in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs), are implicated in drug-seeking behaviors and synaptic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5), an phosphatase known to deactivate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), in cocaine-induced neuroplasticity. While prior research has linked other DUSP family members to various drugs of abuse, the specific role of DUSP5 in cocaine addiction remains unexplored. We hypothesized that lack of DUSP5 contributes to NAcore synaptic plasticity during cue-induced cocaine reinstatement. To test this, we employed a rat cocaine self-administration model, integrated molecular analyses, and mined publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data from cocaine-treated NAcore. Our findings aim to elucidate the potential involvement of DUSP5 in cocaine-related synaptic adaptations and behavior, addressing a significant gap in the mechanistic understanding of SUD.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

We utilized zebrafish's scalability to expose embryos to some of the most commonly used substances: nicotine, alcohol, opioids, and all their possible combinations. After embryonic drug exposure, we conducted a detailed behavioural analysis across three developmental stages. Our results revealed drug-specific outcomes, including both synergistic and antagonistic effects. Furthermore, we identified distinctive effects across development, highlighting potential developmental shifts and individual differences in resilience. Overall, these findings demonstrate that prenatal polydrug exposure results in complex, stage-dependent effects, sometimes antagonistic, which cannot be predicted from single-drug outcomes.

A.; Saunders, S.; Cairns, E.; Barra, L.", "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent synovial inflammation and progressive joint destruction. A hallmark feature of RA is the presence of anti-citrullinated protein autoantibodies (ACPAs), which have been extensively studied in disease pathogenesis. The development of these autoantibodies is strongly associated with the expression of HLA-DR4, containing the shared epitope. More recently, anti-homocitrullinated protein autoantibodies (AHCPAs) have also been implicated in RA and demonstrate a similar genetic association. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the role of homocitrulline immune responses in RA pathogenesis. HLA-DR4 transgenic (DR4tg) and B6 mice were immunized with a synthetic homocitrullinated peptide (HomoCitJED) or PBS followed by a booster 21 days later. Beginning on day 75 post-primary immunization mice received knee intra-articular (i.a.) injections of HomoCitJED once a week for three consecutive weeks. Swelling post i.a. injection was measured using digital calipers. IgG antibodies against homocitrullinated peptides/proteins were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Knees were sectioned and analyzed for histopathological damage and citrullinated/homocitrullinated protein levels. HomoCitJED immunized DR4tg mice exhibited significantly greater swelling and incidence of anti-HomoCitJED and -homocitrullinated fibrinogen IgG autoantibodies. Additionally, 30% had responses against CitJED, a synthetic citrullinated peptide. HomoCitJED immunized DR4tg mice also experienced greater total histopathological damage; however, the immunizations/injections did not affect citrullinated/homocitrullinated protein levels. In conclusion, homocitrulline-specific immune responses can induce RA-like disease in DR4tg mice, supporting the pathogenic role of AHCPAs in RA.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

CHI3L1 also enhanced TGF-{beta}1 effects on lung fibroblasts including myofibroblast transformation, migration and tissue invasion. Mechanistically, CHI3L1 increased TGF-{beta}1-stimulation of Smad, Akt and Erk signaling and PD-L1 played a significant role in TGF-{beta}1/CHI3L1-stimulated myofibroblast transformation. Coculture experiment further confirmed the ability of CHI3L1 to induce profibrotic macrophage activation that enhanced myofibroblast transformation mediated via a CD44-PD-L1 axis. Following in vivo bleomycin challenge, CHI3L1 transgenic mice exhibited significantly higher levels of PD-L1+ M2 macrophages, PD-L1+/PDGFR+ fibroblasts and increased numbers of PD-1+ and CD45+/PD-1+ cells compared to wild-type controls. Notably, combined treatment with anti-CHI3L1 and anti-PD-1 antibodies, or a bispecific anti-CHI3L1-anti-PD-1 antibody, resulted in greater inhibition of bleomycin-induced fibrosis than either antibody alone. These findings suggest that there is a stimulatory interaction between CHI3L1 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in promoting profibrotic macrophage activation and invasive fibroblast differentiation.

CIZ1 assemblies influence underlying chromatin, and their disruption alters the expression of autosomal and X-linked gene clusters. Here, we explore the regulated dissolution of CIZ1-Xi assemblies during mitosis and show that, like Xist, CIZ1 is released in prometaphase under the regulation of Aurora Kinase B (AURKB). The part of human/mouse CIZ1 comprising 179/181 C-terminal amino-acids encodes a matrin-3 domain that facilitates dimerization to form a compact folded core with disordered C-terminal extensions. Mass spectrometry revealed 56 high-confidence interacting partners of the C-terminal fragment, predominantly chromatin, nuclear matrix and RNA-binding proteins. Phosphomimetic mutation of three conserved AURKB sites in the C-terminal extensions released CIZ1 from its nuclear anchor points, but did not affect its interaction with chromatin or nuclear matrix proteins. In contrast, the same mutations, or deletion of the C-terminal extensions, abolished interaction with RNAs including Xist.

Through integration of single-nucleus multiome-sequencing, lineage tracing, spatial transcriptomics, and immunostaining, we identified a novel, transient population of damage-responsive SOX9+ pericentral hepatocytes. This population does not exhibit progenitor-like behavior but instead potentially mediates key aspects of early tissue repair. Specifically, SOX9+ pericentral hepatocytes engage in interactions with hepatic stellate cells and display migratory features associated with wound closure. Moreover, these cells exhibit an immune-related transcriptional signature and colocalize with liver macrophages at injury sites, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses.

We captured seven passerine species in hedgerows adjacent to fields farmed organically or conventionally, within a 250 meter radius representative of their breeding home ranges. Body mass was measured across all species, and an index of coloration intensity, based on carotenoid (yellow/orange) and melanin (black) pigments, was assessed in four species. Additionally, we evaluated three sperm quality parameters (sperm density, percentage of abnormal sperm, and intra individual variance of sperm morphology) using fresh sperm samples collected from four species in the field. We hypothesized that birds living near conventional fields would exhibit lower body mass due to reduced food availability. Additionally, we predicted that the more favourable conditions associated with organic farming, such as greater food abundance and lower exposure to pollutants, would benefit birds, leading to enhanced coloration and improved sperm quality. Our results did not reveal any difference in body mass or coloration. The absence of observable effects might be due to several factors: methodological limitations, cross contamination between habitats or insufficient exposure to farming practices that may hide any potential difference between the two habitats, or the intrinsic adaptive strategies of the species.

Each component's drift, though qualitatively similar to neutral drift, is slower by a factor that depends on the fraction of the system's genetic variance contributed by the component. Our results provide a population-genetic basis for 'system drift', the concept that individual components of a biological system can evolve despite selective constraint on their combined product. A special case is a single polygenic trait under stabilizing selection, where our results predict that the mean genetic contributions to the trait of different subregions of the genome, such as the chromosomes, can drift despite constraint on the genome-wide genetic value. We explore the implications of this latter result for selection against interspecific hybrids and selection against turnovers of sex-determining systems.

We investigate all main radiations within the Begoniaceae family using five previously published Begonia genomes and seven new genome assemblies. We show that Begonia species show more complex, repetitive and dynamic genomes overall than their close relative, the monotypic Hillebrandia sandwicensis. We identify families of repetitive elements that have recently expanded in species from two different highly speciose Southeast Asian sections and two large Neotropical radiations. Detailed characterisation of genomes from species belonging to two parallel radiations, one in Southeast Asia (Begonia section Coelocentrum) and the other in the Neotropics (Begonia section Gireoudia), revealed recent expansion in LTR retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) and satellite DNA, in contrast to more species-poor closely related clades. We further investigate variation in repetitive elements within species, finding that accessions from a population of the widespread Begonia heracleifolia with unusually large genomes show a markedly higher satellite repeat and Ty3/Gypsy LTR-RT content associated with the expansion of a few abundant repeat lineages. We find that accessions derived from this population show lower seed viability in crosses with other conspecific populations, and thus identify a direct link between expansions of repetitive DNA and the process of genetic isolation.

We also performed a single-stranded DNA library preparation (SSP) using mCRC patients and healthy control cirDNA, which allowed us to make the first ever end motif analysis in the literature which compares the use of DSP and SSP. As compared to EMAD (use of DSP), EMAS (use of SSP) produced a very significant difference in end motif frequency and an improved cancer detection performance (ACC, AUC and sensitivity of 0.97, 1.00 and 0.99, respectively). Furthermore, optimal performance was produced when the full-size range was used for EMAS, whereas when the dataset was restricted to fragments of 115 - 220 bp for EMAD. EMAS strong performance, coupled with its compatibility with cost-effective shallow cirDNA sequencing, positions this methodology as a potentially transformative tool in early cancer screening.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

The disease correlates with the formation of insoluble aggregates mostly composed by patient-specific antibody light chains, whose hypervariable regions make each case unique and highlight the need for personalized therapeutics. In this study, we focused on a pathogenic homodimer we previously obtained from a patient-derived light chain. By analyzing the dynamics and the interface of this dimer, we identified a 15-residue peptide with potential inhibitory activity. The peptide was then refined using a computational mutagenesis protocol that iteratively improved its sequence to maximize complementarity with the protein interface, taking into account shape, electrostatics, and hydropathy. The resulting optimized peptide is found to bind the monomer with a binding affinity comparable to that of the full pathogenic interface. These results suggest that the designed peptide could act as an effective antagonist of the pathogenic dimer, and demonstrate that our computational strategy could provide a general framework for designing patient-specific inhibitory peptides against aggregation-prone proteins.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Traumatic injury to the healthy central nervous system (CNS) causes mechanical tissue damage that results in localized cell death and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption. CNS tissue damage stimulates a multicellular wound response to limit the extent of damage but fails to reestablish the normal function of injured tissue. There is strong interest in developing new strategies to augment regeneration after CNS injury. To enable therapy development, reliable assays to screen and identify molecular approaches to augment glial-based wound responses over fibrotic scarring are needed. Scratch assays, which involve mechanically removing cells from an in vitro culture, allow for the simulation of wounds with high throughput and tight control over applied treatments to mechanistically study cell migration and proliferation functions that are critical to effective repair. Current methods require researchers to individually scratch each well with a pipette tip, resulting in low throughput as well as inconsistent scratch widths, straightness, and efficacy within and between wells. Here, we describe the design of a quickly assembled (<30min), inexpensive (<$110) scratch assay rig that readily creates uniform scratches that are straight (average tortuosity < 1.1), have tunable widths (730-1100um), and fully remove damaged cells from the simulated wound region. Designed for a 24-well plate, the rig allows for high-throughput screening of varied experimental conditions or for testing many replicates. Application of the scratch assay device on an in vitro culture of neural progenitor cells (NPC) demonstrates the ability to detect differences in wound closure rate for three unique media conditions. These results support the implementation of this high-throughput scratch assay rig as a method to standardize and improve the efficiency of in vitro wound healing studies.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

In response, this study operationalizes a defense-in-depth toolkit for biosecurity alignment that spans the full model lifecycle. The system is implemented as a Biosecurity Agent on STELLA and comprises four coordinated modes: dataset sanitization, preference alignment, runtime guardrails, and automated red teaming. For dataset sanitization (Mode 1), evaluation is conducted on CORD-19, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset of coronavirus-related scholarly articles (Wang et al., 2020). Three keyword strictness tiers are applied (L1, L2, L3). L1 is a compact high-precision seed list for unambiguous risk indicators and is tuned to minimize false positives. L2 is a human-curated list targeting domain-specific biosafety terms. L3 is a comprehensive union of curated lists and represents the highest strictness. Removal increases monotonically with strictness (0.46% at L1, 20.87% at L2, and 70.40% at L3), illustrating the safety-utility trade-off. For preference alignment (Mode 2), DPO with LoRA adapters internalizes refusals and safe completions, reducing end-to-end attack success rate (ASR) from 59.7% (95% CI 55.6-63.7) to 3.0% (1.0-5.0). At inference (Mode 3), the runtime guard configured at L1/L2/L3 exhibits the expected security-usability trade-off. The L2 setting attains the best balance (F1 = 0.720, precision = 0.900, recall = 0.600, FPR = 0.067). In contrast, L3 minimizes jailbreak success at the cost of higher false positives. Under continuous automated red-teaming (Mode 4), no successful jailbreaks are observed under the tested protocol. Taken together, the agent provides an auditable, lifecycle-aligned blueprint that measurably lowers attack success while preserving benign utility and that supports principled operating-point selection under false-positive budgets for high-stakes deployments.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

In this research, we discuss about the comparative statistical analysis of various features used the in development of machine learning based predictive tools. The sequence features of insect precursor microRNA were compared with precursor microRNA of other available organisms. We initially established that features such as Length, GC content, Minimum Free Energy (MFE) of folding, etc., differs in insects as compared to other organisms using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. We further trained a predictive model for one-vs-rest binary classification using XGBoost between insects, human, monocots, aves, ruminants, sauria, dogs and rodents. We performed PCA and retained 14 principal components for classification using cumulative explained variance. Various parameters of XGBoost was tuned with 5-fold CV and the parameter values with highest CV score were considered. We used independent held-out data test the models.

As standard phylogenetic methods assume independently evolving sites, there is a need for more complex models based on accurate estimations of the fitness landscape. Good candidates are modern generative models -- such as the Potts model -- which successfully capture epistatic effects. However, recent work on generative evolutionary models usually use discrete time, making them difficult to integrate with the standard frameworks in evolutionary biology. We introduce a continuous-time sequence evolution model using the Gillespie algorithm and parameterized by a generative Potts model. This approach enables us to simulate realistic, family-specific evolutionary trajectories and allows for direct comparison with independent-site models. Surprisingly, we find that while epistasis significantly slows down evolution, it does not change the average evolutionary rates at individual sites. This is explained by the rate heterogeneity caused by context-dependence: we show that the rate at some positions varies between null to high values depending on the context, while other positions are essentially independent from the context. Finally, we show that epistasis leads to a systematic underestimation bias in the inference of evolutionary distance between sequences. Overall, our work provides a new tool for simulating realistic protein evolution and offers novel insights into the complex interplay between epistasis and evolutionary dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

However, the complexity of biological processes - spanning multiple molecular layers and involving intricate regulatory interactions - requires models that can capture both intra- and cross-omics relationships. Most existing integration methods primarily focus on sample-level similarities or intra-omics feature interactions, often neglecting the interactions across different omics layers. This limitation can result in the loss of critical biological information and suboptimal performance. To address this gap, we propose X-intNMF, a network-regularized non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model that explicitly incorporates both cross-omics and intra-omics feature interaction networks during multi-omics integration. By modeling these multi-layered relationships, X-intNMF enhances the representation of biological interactions and improves integration quality and prediction accuracy. Results: For evaluation, we applied X-intNMF to predict breast cancer phenotypes and classify clinical outcomes in lung and ovarian cancers using mRNA expression, microRNA expression, and DNA methylation data from TCGA. The results show that X-intNMF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies confirm that incorporating both cross-omics and intra-omics interactions contributes significantly to the model's improved performance. Additionally, survival analysis demonstrates that the integrated multi-omics representation offers strong prognostic value for both overall survival and disease-free status. These findings highlight X-intNMF's ability to effectively model multi-layered molecular interactions while maintaining interpretability, robustness, and scalability within the NMF framework.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Early identification of such donors enables timely intervention, improving transplantation outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. We analyzed demographic and pre- and post-G-CSF laboratory data from 1,160 healthy donors from across multiple institutions and developed two complementary machine-learning frameworks to predict mobilization outcome. A transformer-based probabilistic model (TabPFN) trained on baseline complete blood counts (CBCs) rigorously discriminates poor from good mobilizers. Applying the same architecture to donor data after mobilization attains near-perfect discrimination. To unify the predictions across time points, we introduce an attention-aware neural network that ingests either baseline or post-mobilization data via a ''lab-type'' context flag, enabling accurate prediction of poor mobilizers both before and after G-CSF mobilization. We further validated the framework on data from over 19,000 healthy donors compiled by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research.

The cohort included 156 patients with complete clinical data, comprising a total of 362 tissue samples (tumor, peritumoral, and metaplastic). We identified 541 differentially expressed genes, of which 49 corresponded to previously described CTAs. Between GAC and peritumoral tissues, 14 CTAs exhibited significant differential expression, with MAGEA3, MAGEA6, GOLGA6L1, and MAGEA2 among the most highly expressed in tumors. Relevant associations were observed between the expression of MAGEA3, MAGEA6, POTEF, and CTCFL with TNM staging, as well as IGF2BP1, DAZ1/3/4, YBX2, and PCDHA4 in relation to variables such as tumor depth, metastasis, and TCGA subtypes. Survival analysis demonstrated that high expression of IGF2BP1, CTCFL, CT45A5, and LIN28B was strongly associated with worse prognosis (HR > 2.7), whereas SYCE1L, PIK3R3, and ZNF683 showed a protective effect.

A defining feature of GBM is the presence of glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), which reside in specialized perivascular niches and drive tumor progression, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance. The blood-brain barrier, coupled with the complex and dynamic tumor microenvironment, poses significant challenges for both treatment and mechanistic investigation. Current in vitro GBM models inadequately recapitulate the structural and biochemical cues of the native perivascular niche due to the absence of functional vasculature and brain-mimetic extracellular matrix (ECM), limiting their physiological relevance and predictive power. To address the limitations of existing in vitro GBM models, we developed a patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSC) derived Matrigel spheroid system that transitions into organoids and enables integration into engineered microenvironments. Our model incorporates GSC organoids representing proneural and mesenchymal GBM subtypes, a synthetic engineered extracellular matrix (eECM), and endothelial cells (ECs) seeded on the matrix surface. We evaluated the expression of subtype-specific, pro-angiogenic, stemness, and differentiation markers under increasingly complex co-culture conditions. Our results show that Matrigel-derived GSC spheroids progressively differentiate into organoids over two weeks, with significantly enhanced expression of cell-specific markers in the presence of ECs. Encapsulation of these organoids within eECM, combined with EC co-culture, further promoted cellular invasion and induction of GBM associated genes. This in situ encapsulation strategy enables real-time observation of GSC behavior in a tunable microenvironment that mimics key features of the native tumor niche. Together, this platform provides a physiologically relevant and modular in vitro system for investigating GBM pathophysiology. It holds promise for uncovering tumor-specific cellular dependencies, studying GSC-vascular interactions, and conducting high-throughput drug screening under controlled, biomimetic conditions.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Consequently, the haploid male gametophyte engages in post-pollination competition, one way that pollen genotype can influence inheritance. The maize (Zea mays subsp. mays L.) inflorescence (ear), with its elongated stigma and style structures (silks), has a conspicuous spatial heterogeneity, with longer silks at the base of the ear than those at the apex. To evaluate the hypothesis that alleles with reduced pollen fitness influence the spatial distribution of progeny genotypes along the ear, we developed an updated phenotyping platform that maps mutant Ds-GFP kernel phenotypes on the ear via an implementation of the Faster R-CNN machine vision model (EarVision.v2) and a statistical pipeline that evaluates the relationship between kernel position and transmission ratio (EarScape). In our dataset (1384 ears) representing 58 Ds-GFP alleles, none with Mendelian inheritance (0/48) showed any significant pollen-conditioned spatial trend. In contrast, 50% of alleles with a pollen-specific transmission defect (5/10) exhibited significant spatial effects. An insertion into a gene encoding a putative actin-binding protein, base-to-apex gradient1* (bag1*), conditions increased mutant transmission at the ear apex relative to the base. Surprisingly, mutant alleles of two other pollen-expressed genes can generate the opposite pattern, decreased mutant transmission toward the ear apex; and two mutant alleles of the sperm-cell attachment factor, gamete expressed2 (gex2), can produce ears with transmission highest at both base and apex. We conclude that pollen fitness mutants have relatively common but heterogenous effects on the spatial distribution of progeny genotypes.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Methods: Using adoptive transfer of wild-type or PD-1KO HBV-specific TCR transgenic (C93-TCRtg) CD8 T cells, flow cytometry, and transcriptome sequencing, we systematically profiled early PD-1 dynamics in splenic and intrahepatic T cells and evaluated how PD-1 deficiency shapes anti-HBV T cell responses in acute self-resolving (AR) and chronic (CH) HBV mouse models. Results: Acute HBV infection induced sustained PD-1 upregulation on intrahepatic/splenic CD8 T cells, which predominantly exhibited an effector phenotype. PD-1 cells displayed enhanced proliferation, cytotoxicity, and effector cytokine production compared to PD-1- counterparts. Adoptive transfer of PD-1 KO C93-TCRtg CD8 T cells resulted in significantly impaired early expansion in both spleen and liver during acute infection, accompanied by reduced granzyme B expression while maintaining IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, or IL-2 production. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PD-1 deficiency was associated with the upregulation of apoptosis gene signatures. In chronic HBV infection, PD-1 KO cells failed to expand long-term and exhibited exacerbated exhaustion evidenced by a loss of IFN-{gamma} production. Conclusions: PD-1 is essential for the early expansion and survival of HBV-specific CD8 T cells during acute infection and does not suppress their effector cytokine function. Its absence impairs proliferation and promotes exhaustion of HBV-specific CD8 T cell in chronic infections.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

These antibodies are made by replacing the variable region of a monoclonal antibody with the variable region of another antibody, typically from a different species, enabling use in a wider range of applications. Although theoretically compatible, interspecies differences in antibody structure can complicate chimeric antibody design and performance. In this study, we evaluated the impact of rabbit light chain allotype on the expression and function of chimeric antibodies containing mouse light chain variable regions. We found that constructs using the rabbit kappa 1 b4 (K1-b4) allotype frequently exhibited poor recombinant expression and, in some cases, lost antigen recognition. Structural analysis implicated disruption of an intrachain, interdomain disulfide bond as a contributing factor. Restoration of key residues predicted to re-establish this bond partially rescued both expression and activity. Additionally, chimeric antibodies incorporating the rabbit kappa 1 b9 (K1-b9) allotype, which contains a disulfide bond not disrupted by mouse variable region sequences, consistently maintained robust production and antigen-binding activity across multiple applications, including immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunostaining, for several test antibodies.

Guided by transcriptomic profiling of PGCs, we developed a species-specific medium that supports PGC maintenance and expansion. We identify insulin signaling as essential for survival and demonstrate that retinoic acid receptor inhibition, while maintaining vitamin A, is necessary for propagation. Supplementation with BMP4, LIF, GDNF, and pleiotrophin further enhances PGC proliferation.

Here, we assemble genomes (n = 13) and transcriptomes for 15 species collected between 432 and 6,000 m and integrate them with all publicly available actiniarian data. Phylogenomic analyses reveal a mosaic topology among deep-sea and shallow-water clades. Using a novel framework that contrasts convergent gene-loss patterns, we show that a large number of light-associated gene families-including the complete circadian toolkit-were independently deleted after lineages entered the aphotic realm, whereas comparable loss in shallow taxa is negligible, providing decisive support for a shallow-water origin followed by multiple descents. Intriguingly, some deep-sea lineages further streamline energy budgets by recurrent loss or pseudogenisation of key meiotic genes (e.g., Meiosin, Ythdc2, Spo11, Rad21, Mlh3), indicating a shift towards asexual reproduction. Despite this extensive genomic erosion, deep-sea anemones exhibit sophisticated molecular tuning: specific amino-acid substitutions enhance protein stability and activity under deep-sea conditions, while selective expansions of gene families related to neural excitability, membrane systems, etc., likely mitigate the suppressive environmental effects on vital physiological processes. Enzyme activity assays in the yeast system confirm that the deep-sea variants exhibit superior activity and enhanced growth at 4{degrees}C.

The Northern abalone (or Pinto abalone; Haliotis kamtschatkana) is a marine gastropod mollusc of social, cultural and historical economic importance in the Pacific Northwest of North America that experienced a decline in population density due to commercial harvest and is currently listed as endangered in Canada under the Species at Risk Act. Previous genetic investigations based on microsatellites and reduced-representation approaches concluded that Northern abalone is panmictic throughout its range, from Alaska to California, and identified high levels of genetic variation with no indication of population decline. Using whole genome resequencing data from Northern abalone sampled across the northern part of the species range, we instead identified both: 1) significant differentiation between two genetic groups, albeit very concentrated in the genome; and 2) a strong signature of a dramatic population decline, without evidence of genetic inbreeding. Even though demographic reconstructions showed a timid signal of recent population expansion, the pervasive excess of rare alleles identified (including a high occurrence of singletons) may pose a genetic load risk, potentially hindering the species recovery. We also found evidence of historical, rather than current, connectivity throughout the area investigated.

Mechanistically, reduction in argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) enzyme activity impairs the urea cycle, leading to an accumulation of citrulline and neurotoxic ammonia. Disease severity varies according to the degree of enzyme impairment, ranging from severe neonatal forms (classic citrullinemia) to milder, late-onset forms that may manifest in childhood or adulthood. We established a high-throughput yeast functional assay of human ASS and individually measured the impact of 2193 amino acid substitutions, representing 90% of all single nucleotide variant (SNV)-accessible substitutions. When benchmarked against existing clinical variant annotation, our assay distinguishes known benign variants from strong loss of function pathogenic variants, enabling identification of a functional score threshold below which variants show clinically relevant impairment of ASS activity. Using the ACMG OddsPath framework, our assay meets PS3_supporting criteria for pathogenicity classification and achieves full PS3-level strength when variants observed as homozygotes in other primates are used as benign proxies for calibration. These results provide direct functional evidence to inform reclassification of ASS1 missense variants, supporting their clinical interpretation and diagnostic utility. Mapping functional scores onto the protein structure, we confirmed that residues involved in catalysis are highly sensitive to substitution. In addition, we identified residues from adjacent subunits of the ASS homotetramer that form compound active sites. Assaying these positions revealed a capacity for intragenic complementation consistent with a variant sequestration model: a form of positive epistasis in which deleterious variants from different subunits are sequestered into only a subset of active sites, restoring function in the remaining variant-free sites. The discovery of intragenic complementation in ASS reveals a novel mode of functional interaction with clinical implications for interpreting variant combinations in heterozygous individuals.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

This first layer provides the foundation for the successive deposition of two mats of protein fibers. Fibers from both inner and outer layers appear to have similar amino acid compositions and are notably disulfide-rich (comprising about 10% Cys). ESM has been utilized in a wide variety of applications, including nutraceutical supplements, tissue engineering, and nanofabrication, and yet fundamental questions concerning protein composition, fiber structure, and membrane assembly remain to be resolved. We previously identified an abundant disulfide-rich structural protein in chicken ESM fibers (Cysteine-rich eggshell membrane protein; CREMP) that contains multiple tandemly repeated modules. In this work, we determine a structural model for four consecutive 2-disulfide containing CREMP modules using a variety of two- and three-dimensional solution NMR experiments. CREMP modules feature an N-terminal loop region positioned above a small beta hairpin that is stabilized by a conserved pattern of disulfide bridges between Cys1-3 and Cys2-4. While the individual CREMP modules are highly ordered, the lack of long-range inter-module restraints suggests an extended structure connected by flexible linkers. Finally, the structural information obtained in this work is considered in the context of full-length CREMP proteins and compared to two other structural proteins that contain multiple tandem repeats of 2-disulfide modules.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

The first phase of research focused on validating a novel decellularization protocol for porcine meniscus, which demonstrated the effective removal of cellular content while preserving key ECM constituents including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in both the inner and outer meniscus regions. Subsequently, the decellularized inner meniscus (DIM) and decellularized outer meniscus (DOM) were digested with pepsin and combined with a propriety alginate formulation to enable rapid cell encapsulation under mild conditions. Viability staining confirmed that encapsulated human ASCs remained highly viable over 28 days in culture in proliferation or chondrogenic differentiation media. Under both media conditions, the ASC density was significantly higher in the alginate beads incorporating DIM or DOM as compared to alginate alone controls at 28 days. In addition, gene expression analysis and immunofluorescence staining supported that the incorporation of the pepsin-digested ECM within the alginate enhanced fibrochondrogenic marker expression in the samples cultured in chondrogenic differentiation medium. Qualitatively, more intense staining for collagen types I and II were observed within the beads incorporating DOM as compared to DIM, supporting that the formulations had varying effects.

While large language models (LLMs) show potential for gene prioritization, they suffer from hallucination and lack systematic validation against expert knowledge. Methods: We developed a two-stage computational framework that combines LLM-based screening with literature validation for systematic gene prioritization. Starting with 10,824 genes from the BloodGen3 repertoire, we applied multi-criteria evaluation for sepsis relevance, followed by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using 6,346 curated sepsis publications. A novel faithfulness evaluation system verified that LLM predictions aligned with retrieved literature evidence. Results: The framework identified 609 sepsis-relevant genes with >94% filtering efficiency, demonstrating strong enrichment for inflammatory pathways including TNF- signaling, complement activation, and interferon responses. Literature validation yielded 30 ultra-high confidence therapeutic candidates, including both established sepsis genes (IL10, TREM1, S100A9, NLRP3) and novel targets warranting investigation. Benchmark validation against expert-curated databases achieved 71.2% recall, with systematic correlation between computational confidence and evidence quality. The final candidate set balanced discovery (11 novel genes) with validation (19 known genes), maintaining biological coherence throughout the filtering process. Conclusions: This framework demonstrates that rigorous methodology can transform unreliable LLM outputs into systematically validated biological insights.

T2Rs are expressed in HNSCC cells, where their activation induces apoptosis in vitro. Increased T2R expression in HNSCC also correlates with improved patient survival. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of quercetin as an anticancer T2R agonist in HNSCC cells in vitro and ex vivo.

Cell viability was evaluated using crystal violet assays in cell lines and MTS assays in patient-derived tumor slices. Mitochondrial depolarization was measured with TMRE in the presence and absence of T2R pathway inhibitors. Results: Quercetin induced a Ca2+ response in HNSCC cells, which was significantly reduced by LF1 and YM. Quercetin also decreased cell viability in vitro and showed a potential decrease in viability in tumor slices but was not statistically significant.

More importantly, the predicted spatial gene expression patterns aligned with the known morphologic interactions of the tumor and its microenvironment, capturing biological events directly on Dx-WSIs.

Here, we introduce Cryo-mtscATAC-seq, a broadly applicable method for diverse pathophysiological contexts to isolate nuclei with their associated mitochondria (CryoCells) from frozen samples for high-throughput clonal analysis. We applied Cryo-mtscATAC-seq to the neurodegenerated human brain, glioblastoma (GBM), pediatric neuroblastoma, and human aorta, and implemented mitobender, a computational tool to reduce ambient mtDNA in single-cell assays. Our approach revealed regional clonal gliogenesis and microglial expansions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), persistence of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC)-like clones in GBM recurrence, mtDNA depth heterogeneity after neuroblastoma chemotherapy, and oligoclonal proliferation of smooth muscle cells in human aorta. In conclusion, Cryo-mtscATAC-seq broadly extends mtDNA genotyping to archival frozen specimens across tissue types, opening new avenues for investigation of cell state-informed clonality in human health and disease.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Animal choices were generally risk seeking and satisfied independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) -- a fundamental assumption in standard economic theory. Different neurons encoded the values of individual offers, the choice outcome, and the chosen value -- i.e., the same variables previously identified under binary choices. In addition, other cell groups encoded the chosen probability and the chosen hemifield. Notably, the activity of offer value cells reflected the risk attitude and fluctuated from session to session in ways that matched fluctuations observed behaviorally.

To assess insect populations and communities and identify potential drivers of change in insect populations, we often need to measure in a variety of ways and in a variety of ecosystems. Insect sampling is not standardized: data is frequently collected via different types of insect traps with different targets and modes of capture to sample the insect community. However, different traps may identify contrasting ecological signals, depending on their structure, deployment, and their effective range, and further, these differences may interact with the habitats they are deployed in. Here, we aim to assess the consistency of biodiversity patterns produced from different trapping methods deployed in array across several habitats. We investigated three trapping methods: an ant bait trap, a malaise trap, and a fermentation trap. We deployed these traps in a suburban forested area and at a restored forest. We computed richness and relative abundance of insects captured in each trap and assessed community compositional differences between traps and habitats. We found that each trap type produced differential patterns of richness, abundance, and composition from each other, and these patterns also varied between sites for most trap types. The contrasting patterns observed among traps is likely due to differing effective capture ranges of each trap; traps with smaller effective capture ranges were more sensitive to local habitat conditions than traps with broader effective capture ranges.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

While sex chromosome aneuploidies are well-tolerated due to dedicated allelic dosage compensation mechanisms, the existence of similar regulatory processes for autosomes remains debated. Here, we investigate transcriptional responses to autosomal aneuploidies and find evidence for global dosage compensation across aneuploid chromosomes. Using high-sensitivity, allele-resolved single-cell RNA-seq on monoclonal cell expansions with varying ploidies and degrees of autosomal aneuploidy, we uncover consistent transcriptional compensation upon chromosome losses via increased burst frequency from the remaining allele. This operates in a region-specific manner across both complete and segmental aneuploidies, revealing a previously underappreciated flexibility of dosage response. Complementary proteomics analyses demonstrate additional dosage buffering at the protein level, resulting in near-stoichiometric rebalancing across autosomal aneuploid chromosomes. Analyses of cancer transcriptomes confirms that compensatory mechanisms are active in primary tumours. Our findings reveal extensive dosage compensation as a genome-wide, dynamic, response to gene product imbalance. This mechanism extends beyond sex chromosomes, supports transcriptional homeostasis, and represents a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved mode of transcriptional regulation active across species and in aneuploid cancer cells.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Unlike fission yeast Sgo1, mammalian shugoshin (SGO2) persists at centromeres throughout meiosis I and II, but REC8 cohesin is protected only during meiosis I. Here, we show that fission yeast Moa1 and Sgo1 appear at kinetochores/centromeres from prophase I to metaphase I and are degraded during anaphase I by the APC/C-Slp1 pathway. We expressed non-degradable versions of Moa1 and Sgo1 in meiosis II and investigated how these proteins protect the cohesin Rec8 during meiosis II. Our analyses suggest that the localization of Sgo1 and the phosphorylation of Rec8 at S449 and S450 are necessary and sufficient events for protecting Rec8 cohesin during meiosis II.

ETS transcription factors, including SPIB and SPI1, are implicated in lymphoma pathogenesis and can be targeted by the small molecule TK216, which disrupts ETS-DHX9 interactions. To explore mechanisms of resistance, we generated stable TK216-resistant clones from the ABC-DLBCL line U2932. Resistant clones displayed a 4-5-fold increase in IC50 values and lost G2-M arrest upon treatment. Transcriptomic and mutational analyses revealed three resistance patterns: (i) MDR1/ABCB1 overexpression, leading to multidrug efflux; (ii) Cluster A, enriched for proliferation, Wnt, and transcriptional programs, with mutations in ESR2, USP24, and SFSWAP; and (iii) Cluster B, characterized by actin/microtubule remodeling, altered metabolism, and mutations in SRSF11 and PATJ. Pharmacologic screening identified increased sensitivity of resistant cells to BCL2, MCL1, and XPO1 inhibitors, while showing reduced sensitivity to aurora kinase and microtubule-targeting agents. Venetoclax and selinexor retained activity in resistant models, supporting their potential for rational combinations with TK216.

To address this knowledge gap, we integrated phylogenetic, transcriptomic, and genome-wide in vitro binding strategies with quantitative shoot architecture phenotyping of a panel of cucumber TILLING mutants of each CsPLT homolog. We determined that CsPLT3/7 and CsPLT are expressed in complementary domains in the cucumber shoot apex. DAP-seq data indicated that both transcription factors recognised an ANT-like consensus motif and bound to SAM organising genes. We identified strong phenotypic defects in multiple Csplt3/7 mutants. In mature seeds, Csplt3/7 mutants formed a flat apex instead of a shoot apical meristem, from which secondary meristems emerged during subsequent seedling development. Mature Csplt3/7 shoots exhibited defects in internode length regularity, stem architecture, flower morphology, and axillary organ initiation. Moreover, phyllotactic patterns were slightly shifted from a spiral towards a distichous orientation.

Its capacity progressively declines with age, and this change can lead to the development of various neurodegenerative pathologies including Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). SCA1 is mainly caused by mutations in the polyglutamine region of Ataxin 1 protein. In patients affected by the disease, Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum frequently undergo demise and eventually become lost. Here we tested whether two well-characterized autophagy-enhancing small molecules, AUTEN-67 and -99, which antagonize the autophagy complex Vps34 through blocking the myotubularin-related lipid phosphatase MTMR14/EDTP, have the capacity to ameliorate SCA1 symptoms. We found that in a Drosophila model of SCA1, only AUTEN-67 exerts positive effects including improvement of climbing ability and extending life span. Based on these results, we hypothesized that the two compounds influence autophagy in the brain in a neuron-specific manner. Indeed, according to data we obtained, AUTEN-67 and -99 exhibit shared and unique functional domains in the Drosophila brain. AUTENs enhanced autophagy in GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons. In addition, AUTEN-67 also affected autophagy in cholinergic neurons, while AUTEN-99 triggered the process in glutaminergic neurons and motoneurons. We also observed varying efficiencies between the two AUTENs among different subtypes of cultured hippocampal neurons of mice. These data suggest that the two compounds display neuron-specific differences in exerting autophagy-enhancing effects, and may lead to a better understanding of in which types of neurons autophagy could potentially be activated to treat SCA1 in human patients.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

We selected one of these proteins, which we named MjCRSP for further characterisation. MjCRSP was predicted to have a signal peptide at the N-terminus end and a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus region. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana, we show that this protein inhibits elicitin infestin1 (INF1)-triggered cell death and immune responses triggered by Flg22 peptide.

Here, we systematically compare clustering and de novo assembly methods using PacBio Iso-Seq data from 17 animal lineages spanning seven phyla, most of them non-model species, with the goal of investigating which methodology is more adequate to select one isoform per gene model, in the absence of specific pipelines to do so. We evaluate four approaches: isoseq cluster, CD-HIT, RNA-Bloom2 and isONform. We benchmark them with short-reads using Trinity, assessing assembly quality with BUSCO completeness, short-read mapping rates, coding sequence recovery, and longest isoform prediction. Our results show that CD-HIT clustering at high similarity thresholds ([&ge;]99%) yields the most complete and coding-rich long-read transcriptomes, rivaling Trinity while avoiding its high redundancy. Consensus-based methods such as isoseq cluster and isONform recover fewer single-copy orthologs (mirrored in a lower BUSCO score) and achieve lower mapping rates, while RNA-Bloom2 provide intermediate performance with reduced duplication. Together, these findings establish, to date, CD-HIT as a robust and practical strategy for transcriptome reconstruction from long-read data when genomic references are unavailable.

Subsequent network and functional enrichment analyses of the GWAS-delineated genes demarcated key biological processes crucial for maintaining root growth under drought, including DNA repair, tRNA editing, protein folding and quality control, cell cycle regulation, stress granule assembly, and the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) salvage pathway regulating oxidative stress in roots. Expression level polymorphisms, promoter cis-element variations, and amino acid substitutions affecting predicted protein dynamics, with phenotype and climate associations, were identified.

The reward history of features slowed down learning by attracting fixations of non-rewarded distractors that were previously targets. This reward history bias persisted in fixations used to choose objects even after choice accuracy stabilized. In contrast, fixational sampling that preceded a choice showed negligible history biases that were overcome quickly in favor of wider exploratory sampling.

We address this by using an immune database from Kenyan children with perinatal HIV and unexposed controls. We computationally integrate T cell profiles of differentiation, activation and exhaustion in an agent-based model (ABM) to predict how T cell exhaustion impacts viral control following HIV exposure in vitro. Our ABM includes macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T cells, cytokines, and HIV. Model mechanisms include viral dynamics, macrophage activation, T cell activation and proliferation, cytotoxic T cell killing, and cytokine/HIV diffusion and degradation. Participants are grouped by HIV plasma viremia and by age, less than 5 years or 5-18 years. Our findings indicate that cells from virally active participants, who have the highest levels of exhaustion, have lower predicted viral concentrations and infected cells compared to other participant groups during new infection. However, this coincides with higher cell death, suggesting that short-term viral control is associated with excessive inflammation, which could be detrimental long-term. Cells from virally suppressed participants older than 5 years can maintain lower viral concentrations while limiting cell death, reflecting a more sustainable short-term immune response. In virally suppressed children younger than 5 years, immune response patterns strongly resemble the age-matched healthy control group, suggesting early viral suppression may preserve antiviral immune responses. Our model predicts unique patterns of cell death for each participant group, with CD8 T cell death being dominant in virally active groups and CD4 T cell and macrophage death being dominant in healthy and virally suppressed groups. Finally, exhausted CD8 T cells are predicted to contribute significantly to CD8 T cell killing, proliferation, and activation in the virally active group, indicating partially functional CD8 T cells can still contribute to short-term viral control.

To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others.

We also explored the role of resting-state fMRI in linking these phenomena. Increased anxiety was linked to stronger self-blaming emotions, and more pronounced self-attacking and hiding. When experiencing negative emotions about themselves (i.e. shame and self-anger), anxious individuals were also less likely to disengage from self-focused thoughts. These behavioural findings were paralleled by enhanced guilt-related connectivity between the left sATL and bilateral posterior subgenual cingulate cortex. The relevance of temporal lobe activity for self-blaming emotions was also evident in the resting-state data. Interestingly, while the approach-avoidance motivation towards guilt memories was unrelated to anxiety, this emotional dimension showed distinct contributions of the left and right sATL, with task-related activity of the former and connectivity of the latter associated with, respectively, more approach and avoidance. As such, the results of the current study link the self-blaming bias of anxious individuals to specific maladaptive patterns of behaviour. Furthermore, the work provides robust evidence for the important role of ATL-related circuitry in guilt processing, supporting its broader involvement in social conceptual processing.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Using apple (Malus domestica) as a model, we integrate 218 whole genomes (68 cultivated dessert/cider; 150 wild: M. sieversii, M. orientalis, M. sylvestris), RNA-seq, and a flowering-time GWAS to resolve how these forces forged the cultivated apple genome. Despite weak neutral differentiation and widespread admixture, dessert and cider apples form distinct gene pools that derive primarily from M. sieversii - M. orientalis rather than European M. sylvestris. We find no evidence of a strong domestication bottleneck, as expected in perennials. Demography-aware selection scans reveal largely non-overlapping targets: dessert shows more hard sweeps at genes linked to fruit quality, disease resistance, and flowering, whereas cider shows proportionally more soft sweeps and balancing selection; RNA-seq differential expression supports these candidates. Wild-to-crop introgression from M. sylvestris is extensive but heterogeneous by context: some introgressed tracts concentrate in hard-sweep regions and approach fixation (consistent with rapid, targeted uptake), whereas others persist at intermediate frequencies with soft-sweep signatures (consistent with diffuse, recurrent introgression of adaptive alleles). Extending to the phenotype, the lead chromosome 9 flowering-time association lies within an introgressed segment near a transposable element and is separated from sweep peaks, consistent with regulatory/polygenic control. Cultivated apples carry a lower predicted deleterious load than wild relatives. Together, these results provide one of the most comprehensive population genomic portraits of a perennial fruit tree domestication, clarifying how selection and adaptive introgression jointly shaped the cultivated apple genome architecture and yielding actionable targets for breeding and conservation.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

However, the precise mechanisms by which microtubule dynamics are regulated during the development of the nervous system remain poorly understood. Here, we use global phosphoproteomic screening to identify cytoskeletal substrates of Ser-Arg Protein Kinase (SRPK), which is implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. We show that SRPK directly phosphorylates Microtubule Associated Protein (MAP)1S at multiple sites in a C-terminal region involved in proteolytic maturation and microtubule binding. SRPK-dependent MAP1S phosphorylation modulates the affinity of the MAP1S microtubule binding domain for microtubules and MAP1S proteolytic processing by the Calpain (CAPN)10 protease. Finally, we show that MAP1S proteolytic processing occurs progressively during neurodevelopment via a specific CAPN10 expression switch, corresponding with MAP1S acquisition of microtubule binding activity. Our results demonstrate a role for SRPK in coordinating processing and functionalisation of a key microtubule regulatory protein during neurodevelopment and provide insight into mechanisms by which the microtubule cytoskeleton may be dysregulated in neurological diseases.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Our custom HA tiled-amplicon panel was sensitive, fast, and cost-effective, making it suitable for monitoring low-abundance seasonal variants of known subtypes. However, its reliance on conserved and intact primer-binding sites limited primer design to fewer subtypes. A previously published universal amplicon method targeted all IAV subtypes, but it performed poorly in wastewater due to its reliance on intact genome segments. Probe-capture methods were resilient to RNA degradation and mismatches, potentially enabling broader surveillance and detection of emerging strains. However, probes were costly, labor-intensive, and less sensitive than tiled-amplicon.

In planktonic marine cyanobacteria, they also enhance buoyancy and protect against grazing, yet their consequences for the oceanic carbon pump and microbial loop remain poorly understood. Pili production in dilute marine ecosystems entails ecological trade-offs, including high nutrient investment and, as we show here, increased vulnerability to phage infection. Using high-resolution electron microscopy, we observed cyanophages attaching along the entire length of extracellular pili, indicating that these filaments act as structural amplifiers of viral encounter in diffusion-limited environments. While piliated and non-piliated Synechococcus exhibited similar mortality in isolation, competition assays revealed a strong selective disadvantage for piliated cells, which were more rapidly depleted in mixed populations. This effect was most pronounced for cyanophage S-CAM7, which displayed higher pili-binding affinity and drove competitive exclusion of piliated hosts. To extend these findings to natural settings, we analysed single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) observing pili genes encoded by 14.7% of total cyanobacterial SAGs. This proportion increased to 28.1% in virally infected SAGs (virocells; representing 3.8% of the total cyanobacterial SAGs), consistent with encounter-driven susceptibility of piliated cells in the environment. Together, our results identify type IV pili as double-edged structures: while conferring ecological advantages, they expose cells to viral attack by increasing encounter probability when pilus-attached phage are transport to the cell surface during pili retraction. This fitness cost may help explain the patchy distribution of pili in natural populations and the extreme sequence variability of pilins, reflecting an ongoing evolutionary arms race with phage.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Urinary microRNAs (miRNAs), especially exosomal ones, are promising non-invasive biomarkers due to their stability in biological fluids and disease specificity. However, challenges such as population variability, methodological inconsistencies and normalization issues hinder their clinical translation, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches to enhance diagnostic performance. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of urinary exosomal let-7c cluster (let-7c-5p, miR-99a-5p and miR-125b-5p) in BCa patients by integrating miRNA expression data with Machine Learning (ML) models. Methods: Urine samples were collected from 66 participants, including 50 BCa patients and 16 healthy controls (HC). Exosomal miRNAs were isolated and quantified using Quantitative Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (qRT-PCR). Statistical analysis and hypothesis tests were conducted to explore the nature and diagnostic relevance of individual biomarkers. A logistic regression classifier was applied to evaluate both the combined and differential diagnostic capabilities of the selected biomarkers. Accuracy, precision, recall, and AU-ROC scores were used to assess model performance. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify pathways associated with the features prioritized by the ML models, ensuring their relevance to BCa. Results: The result revealed significant differentiation between BCa patients and HC, with miR-99a-5p (p=0.013, AU-ROC=0.71) and miR-125b-5p (p=0.047, AU-ROC=0.64) demonstrating reliable diagnostic performance (let-7c-5p showed weaker discrimination, AU-ROC=0.65, p>0.1). The logistic regression ML model achieved an accuracy of 80.0% (AU-ROC=0.86, recall=100%) in distinguishing cancer from HC and 53.3% (AU-ROC=0.63) when applied to miRNA-only grade classification. When clinical variables were integrated with miRNA expression, performance improved to 73.3% accuracy (AU-ROC=0.61) for high-versus low-grade differentiation. Across Ta-T2, miR-99a-5p displayed relatively better separation, whereas let-7c-5p and miR-125b-5p showed weak stage-related differences. The integration of bioinformatics analysis confirmed the biological relevance of these miRNAs in BCa-related pathways, including PI3K-Akt, p53, NF-{kappa}B and RAS/MAPK signaling, with hub genes such as TP53, MYC, EGFR, and CCND1 identified, further validating the diagnostic utility of the selected biomarkers. Conclusion: Urinary let-7c cluster miRNAs demonstrate promising diagnostic potential when analyzed with ML models, offering a non-invasive alternative to conventional methods.

In the current study, we examined the potential mechanisms for the development of myocardial pro-fibrotic factors and cardiac remodeling in C57BL/6J mice after AKI. The mice were subjected to bilateral pedicle clamping for 30 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Heart tissue was collected from control (Ctrl) and AKI mice and subjected to proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and differential mRNA expression analysis by RNA-seq. Cardiac tissue was collected to assess serine protease activity, RNA, protein and cytokine expression. The results indicate that AKI significantly upregulated SerpinA3N in the heart which was negatively correlated with serine protease (Granzyme B) activity. Further, AKI induced the development of several pro-fibrotic factors, induced mitochondrial dysfunction and increased inflammation. Finally, using H9C2 cells we demonstrated that inhibiting SerpinA3N with XAV939 increased Granzyme B activity. Thus, this study suggests that AKI leads to the development of pro-fibrotic factors in the heart and disrupts cardiac remodeling by SerpinA3N mediated inhibition of serine protease Granzyme B activity. Decreased SerpinA3N expression in the heart followed by AKI could lead to a more balanced extracellular matrix (ECM) composition in the heart with an alleviated pro-fibrotic response.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

In this study, we identified two sequential waves of translation critical for proper development progression. The first wave occurred within 1 h after fertilization and included translation of ewsr1b mRNA, which encodes an RNA-binding protein Ewsr1b. The resulting Ewsr1b protein promoted the second translation wave through binding to cytoplasmic mRNAs, including pou5f3 mRNA, which encodes a transcription factor essential for development. In contrast, an RNA-binding protein Syncrip accumulated in eggs and repressed pou5f3 mRNA translation until the second wave. Notably, ewsr1b mRNA translated in the first wave harbored a short 3' untranslated region (UTR) comprising 16 nucleotides, whereas ewsr1b mRNA translated in the second wave had a long 3'UTR comprising 302 nucleotides. This difference determined not only translational timing but also Ewsr1b's localization and function.

This heterogeneity has been observed in both primary Estrogen Receptor alpha positive (ER+) breast tumors and cell lines. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms regulating expression heterogeneity is critical towards developing effective therapies. A key contributor to gene expression variability is the stochastic nature of transcription. Transcription occurs in a probabilistic, burst-like manner, in which gene activation occurs intermittently, producing RNA in pulses and interspersed with transcriptional off-periods. The estrogen-responsive gene TFF1 is expressed in the majority of ER breast tumors and exemplifies such heterogeneity, with transcriptional inactivity ranging from minutes to several days. Here, we identify the molecular mechanism underlying the wide range in TFF1 expression by analyzing cells sorted based on their TFF1 activity levels. We observed that TFF1 inactive (TFF1low) cells exhibit a repressive chromatin state marked by H3K27me3 at the TFF1 promoter and enhancer. Despite global similarity in ER binding, occupancy at the TFF1 regulatory elements was selectively reduced in TFF1low cells, resulting in fewer active alleles and diminished transcriptional bursting frequency. Conversely, TFF1high cells exhibited more active TFF1 alleles and hyperbursting. These cells also retained sensitivity to endocrine therapy, while TFF1low cells displayed reduced drug responsiveness. Genome-wide, differentially enriched H3K27me3 regions correlated with variable expression of estrogen-responsive genes, highlighting a broader regulatory mechanism that links chromatin state to expression variability.

However, the relevance of plant integrity in plant-herbivore interactions, particularly in direct plant defences, is unclear and lacks empirical molecular validation. To test this, we measured the expression of plant defence-related genes (PPO-D and PI-IIc, involved in the jasmonate signal pathway and PR-1a, involved in the salicylic acid signal pathway) in intact plants and detached leaves of two tomato varieties infested or not with the herbivorous spider mite Tetranychus urticae. We also tested whether defences persisted in detached leaves after one, four, seven or fourteen days of infestation. We found that tomato defences were induced in both intact plants and detached leaves and that the expression of all three genes in detached leaves increased over time, being the increment higher in the two late-expression genes, PI-IIc and PR-1a. Such results suggests that both intact plants and detached leaves can be used in studies addressing herbivore interactions with plant defences. However, induction levels in intact plants and detached leaves varied with plant variety and the gene assessed, ranging from higher expression in detached leaves than in intact plants to the reverse. Hence, studies aiming at identifying the role of specific genes should account for the differential, variety-dependent, role of plant integrity in their expression.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Salinity is an important environmental parameter affecting the performance of fish larvae, and recent studies have shown that some larval fish use it as an environmental cue to position, orientate and navigate. Further, fish larvae are often visual feeders, and light has been suggested to be a crucial environmental cue for visual orientation and feeding. In this study, we investigate whether first-feeding larvae of eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias) are driven by light and salinity. We examine this in the context of their natural vertical distribution and movement; from deeper, darker and more saline (13-17 psu) water layers towards the more light-exposed and less saline (7 psu) surface water. Further, we investigate the relationship between this movement and the neutral buoyancy measured both in active and passive larvae. We found that the larvae remain in a saline environment close to the salinity which supports their neutral buoyancy. They show negative phototaxis, suggesting an active avoidance of the lighter and less saline upper water layers. These results improve our understanding of the ecophysiology and behaviour of eastern Baltic cod larvae during the first-feeding stage and serve as an important input for restocking efforts of eastern Baltic cod and potential future production of hatchery rearing of eastern Baltic cod.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Such effects have primarily been explored in the context of neighboring individuals within single habitats, however pollinators are highly mobile foragers that can readily cross ecological boundaries, raising the potential for invaders to affect native plants across ecological boundaries. Here, we examine the potential of invasive plant species to affect native plant species with which they share pollinators in a mosaic of 22 native-plant-dominated meadows on serpentine soil, embedded in a matrix of non-serpentine meadows. The non-serpentine meadows contain dense stands of two insect-pollinated invasive species: Vicia villosa, flowering in spring; Centaurea solstitialis, flowering in summer. The serpentine meadows contain two native species that co-flower and share pollinators with these invasive plants: Trifolium fucatum and Helianthus exilis, respectively. Across three years, we determined that the abundance ratio of each invasive species to its co-flowering native species, within radii of 250-1000 meters of focal patches of the native plant, was associated with decreased visitation rates, seed set, and contribution to plant-pollinator network structure for the native species. We conclude that invasive plants can have indirect cross-boundary effects on native plants in neighboring ecosystems, via competition for shared pollinators. These findings suggest that the spillover of pollinators across ecological boundaries may have consequences for plant reproduction and the structural stability of plant-pollinator interactions.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

The domestication of perennial Mediterranean fruit trees is less studied than that of annual crops. The common fig (Ficus carica L.) is thought to have been domesticated in the Levant before dispersion across the Mediterranean. However, pre-human fossils of F. carica in Europe suggest an ancient wild presence, challenging the assumption of a single eastern origin. We used microsatellite markers to genotype 949 fig accessions comprising cultivated and spontaneous individuals collected from 14 Mediterranean and Near Eastern countries representing F. carica sensu stricto and its two close relatives, F. carica subsp. rupestris, and, F. colchica. Principal component analysis revealed that F. carica sensu stricto forms a cohesive genetic group distinct from its two relatives, which are actually different species. Bayesian clustering revealed three major gene pools within F. carica sensu stricto -- Moroccan-Algerian, Northern Mediterranean, and Levantine--each containing both cultivated and spontaneous individuals. The Levantine group was the most differentiated, while the other two were closer genetically, together reflecting a longitudinal Mediterranean structure. Cultivated and spontaneous figs were genetically indistinguishable within each region, supporting a model of diffuse, regionally independent domestication rather than a single Levantine origin. These results highlight spontaneous populations and local landraces as key reservoirs of genetic variation, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, and the Levant. Our study provides a foundation for future genomic work to identify the genetic basis of key traits, emphasizing that practical breeding and conservation strategies should rely on regional biodiversity rather than a narrow set of elite cultivars to enhance fig resilience and productivity in the face of climate change and emerging disease pressures.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

In this study we explore whether a previously developed target capture bait set, FrogCap, can be used to answer genomic questions within the genus, by applying it to the three taxa of Pelophylax native to the Netherlands. We observe that the target capture data cleanly separates the three taxa, confirming significant introgression of P. lessonae mtDNA into P. ridibundus from the Netherlands. We also show that target capture is an efficient method for identifying polyploidy in P. esculentus and is effective at determining ancestral contribution within our sample population.

Diminished activity of CYP51 leads to metabolism associated liver disease, ending in hepatocellular carcinoma. It is still not clear which processes are most affected in the hepatocytes and how they communicate with other cells towards the progressive liver pathology. Herein we describe a new inducible, liver-specific Cyp51 knockout mouse model (iLKO), developed to study how acute disruption of cholesterol synthesis is managed in the adult liver. Doxycycline inducible deletion avoided developmental confounders of albumin-Cre models and enabled isolation of viable primary hepatocytes. iLKO hepatocytes and liver tissue showed CYP51 depletion with accumulation of lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, while hepatic cholesterol levels remained largely unchanged, indicating compensatory uptake and/or pathway rerouting. Histological examination and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed hepatomegaly with mild portal inflammation and ductular reaction but no overt fibrosis at the studied time points. iLKO hepatocytes displayed increased nuclear lipid droplets (LD) that might be involved in adaptation to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Additionally, we discovered crystal-like inclusions, especially in Kupffer cells. MALDI-TOF MSI could not resolve their composition, but their occurrence alongside sterol overload implicates non-cholesterol sterol crystallization as a potential trigger of inflammation. In summary, iLKO is a suitable model for dissection of sterol toxicity, clearly separated from developmental effects of Cyp51 depletion. Future examinations could reveal how toxic sterol intermediates are buffered in adult liver and how they might be connected to inflammation driven pathologies, relevant also to human health.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Although somatic SV detection has been extensively studied in cancer, these studies are not directly applicable to the study of tissue mosaicism, as they rely on matched normals, target higher VAF ranges, and are enriched for different types of SVs. We present comprehensive benchmark data and best practices for non-cancer somatic SV detection. We created a synthetic mosaic sample by combining six HapMap individuals at varying proportions, generating allele fractions as low as 0.25%. This sample was sequenced to ~2,300x total coverage using Illumina, PacBio, and Nanopore technologies across multiple sequencing centers. A high-confidence benchmark SV set containing over 21,000 pseudo-somatic insertions and deletions of 50bp or larger was derived from haplotype-resolved assemblies. We evaluated 12 SV discovery pipelines and identified caller-specific strengths and sequencing platform-specific shortcomings. We find that short read-based approaches show reduced recall for insertions and repeat-associated SVs, whereas long-read sequencing achieves high accuracy throughout the genome, increasing linearly with coverage. The best algorithm's sensitivity exceeded 80% for VAFs >4% and 15% for VAFs of 0.5-1% with 60x coverage.

Despite compelling evidence for this dependency based on glutathione depletion, the cause for the cell cycle arrest had remained unclear. Cell cycle control may depend on either the absolute amount of glutathione or on the glutathione redox potential (EGSH). To unambiguously distinguish those two options, we characterized an allelic series of six Arabidopsis mutants affected in glutamate-cysteine ligase, which catalyses the first step for the biosynthesis of reduced glutathione (GSH). When grown under the same conditions, even mutants with 20% and 50% of wild-type GSH amounts are slightly stunted. The most severely compromised mutants, zir1 and rml1, were crossed with either gr1, which lacks cyto-nuclear glutathione disulfide reductase and was used to induce a pronounced shift in EGSH, or with bir6, which has a diminished glutathione consumption and thus exhibits slightly increased levels of GSH. Based on theoretical considerations, these levels are not expected to shift the EGSH to any significant extent. Our study shows that deleting GR1 in the zir1 or rml1 background does not result in an obvious phenotypic change. By contrast, deleting BIR6 was sufficient to suppress the growth arrest in rml1 and to attenuate the growth in zir1. These findings demonstrate that root growth is dependent on the availability of sufficient amounts of GSH, and not affected by pronounced changes in EGSH. This insight provides a decisive step towards understanding the mechanisms underpinning the proposed role of glutathione in cell cycle and growth control.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Immunotherapy targeting A{beta} and Tau proteins is a promising strategy, and accurate detection of anti-A{beta} or anti-Tau antibodies is key to evaluating vaccine efficacy. Indirect ELISA is a sensitive method requiring high-quality coating antigens. Methodology: A recombinant Tau antigen fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was designed as an ELISA coating antigen. The Tau gene was cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Protein expression was induced with 1 mmol/L isopropyl-{beta}-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG), and the GST-Tau fusion protein was identified by Western blot using anti-Tau and anti-GST antibodies. The protein was solubilized with 3 mol/L urea and purified via glutathione affinity chromatography. Purity was confirmed by densitometry and the optimal coating concentration for ELISA was determined to be 2 {micro}g/mL. Results: A protocol was established to produce GST-Tau with adequate purity and yield for ELISA applications. The recombinant antigen retained immunogenic epitopes, recognized by anti-Tau antibodies. The standardized ELISA enabled sensitive detection of anti-Tau antibodies. Conclusions: A robust method was developed to produce and optimize GST-Tau as a coating antigen for indirect ELISA.

However, field evidence for how these effects scale with invader density, and whether responses are nonlinear, remains limited. We examined whether local stem density of the invasive shrub Ardisia crenata is associated with shifts in soil chemistry and soil microbiomes. The local density of A. crenata, which reproduces clonally with apomictic seeds, forms a gradient from high density to low density across invaded stands. Our results show strong differences in soil ecosystems with invasion, including consistently lower soil moisture, pH, organic matter, total carbon, total nitrogen, and electrical conductivity. These changes were accompanied by shifts in the community composition of soil prokaryotes and fungi, such as increased abundances of Acidothermus and Saitozyma with higher density of A. crenata. While the exact mechanisms causing these changes could not be established, increases of more labile above- and below-ground litter, as well as A. crenata specific secondary metabolites, were possible causal factors. We conclude that strong changes in soil ecosystems can be caused by invasive plants in a mesic forest understory, especially when they occur at high densities. Hence, to maintain healthy soil ecosystems, it is recommendable to control aggressive invasive plants such as A. crenata before they reach high densities.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Environmental stressors often co-occur, yet their combined effects on organisms remain poorly understood. As multifactorial anthropogenic changes intensify and alter environmental selection pressures, our understanding of stressor interactions is becoming increasingly important. However, established methods for characterizing the effects of stressor interactions can involve considerable experimental and computational labour. Here, we investigate how pairwise combinations of six divalent metal ions (Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) affect the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using a high-throughput assay to generate concentration-response surfaces for all 15 combinations. We introduce {delta}, an easily calculable metric that quantifies the toxicity of a mixture relative to the toxicities of its individual components, and compare it to an established metric for synergism/antagonism, a, determined by calculating deviation from a null model of additivity, i.e., \"concentration addition\". Yeast growth rates reveal that metal mixture toxicity varies widely from the additive expectation with the effect of the combination ranging from greatly enhanced toxicity to greatly attenuated toxicity. Combinations with copper were more toxic than expected, and combinations with manganese or nickel were less. These trends correspond to known redox activities and metal-binding properties, pointing to possible mechanistic underpinnings rooted in oxidative stress and metal cofactor displacement. Furthermore, we find that a correlates with overlap in known metal resistance genes and similarity in redox potential, offering predictive insight into effects of metal interactions. While a provides a model-based measure of synergism or antagonism, {delta} serves as an intuitive, concentration-robust descriptor of ecological impact. Together, these metrics highlight the complexity of metal-metal interactions and the importance of accounting for non-additive effects in ecotoxicological assessments.

K.; Zolkiewski, M.; Geisbrecht, E. R.; Beck, M. R.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myopalladin (MYPN) is a striated muscle-specific sarcomeric protein belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig)-domain-containing family of actin regulators. The Ig3 domain of MYPN is indispensable for interacting with and stabilizing actin filaments, and an increasing number of cardiomyopathic (CM)-associated mutations have been identified within this domain, highlighting its importance for normal cardiac function. Despite their clinical significance, the molecular basis of how these variants disrupt MYPN activity remains poorly understood. METHODS: To identify actin-binding sites, we introduced charge-neutralizing alanine substitutions at basic residues in the Ig3 domain and assessed their impact using actin co-sedimentation assays. CM mutations were similarly evaluated for their effect on actin interaction. Wild-type (WT) and mutant MYPN were expressed in Drosophila cardiomyocytes and body wall muscles to assess localization and interaction with actin. The impact of these mutations on protein secondary structure and stability was determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. In addition, the WT Ig3 domain was further analyzed in co-sedimentation and co-polymerization assays to quantify polymerization of monomeric actin, subsequent bundling and to assess how calcium and salt concentrations modulate MYPN Ig3-actin interactions. RESULTS: MYPN-actin binding is electrostatically driven and mediated by conserved basic charge clusters within its Ig3 domain, a mechanism common among many actin-binding proteins. CM mutations disrupted the MYPN-actin interaction, leading to significant loss of actin bundling without broadly altering secondary structure, except in the destabilized P961L variant. Immunostaining and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged constructs revealed that R955W and P961L mutants accumulated into clusters at the Z-discs. WT Ig3 domain assays further showed that MYPN promotes actin polymerization and crosslinking even under non-polymerizing conditions, and actin-binding activity was not modulated by calcium. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that CM-linked MYPN Ig3 mutations compromise actin binding and organization, suggesting that disruption of the MYPN-actin interface is a key pathogenic mechanism in cardiomyopathy.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Gemcitabine, a pyrimidine anti-metabolite, is a cornerstone in PDAC therapy. However, resistance remains a major hurdle in clinical care. Resistance can arise from microenvironmental metabolites or through direct metabolic reprogramming of pancreatic cancer cells. Here, we generated PDAC models of acquired gemcitabine resistance to determine the relationship between these mechanisms. We observed that physiological levels of exogenous pyrimidines have a diminished ability to impact gemcitabine response in PDAC cells with acquired resistance. This occurs as the metabolic reprogramming of PDAC cells in response to gemcitabine treatment forces a suppression of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. Importantly, this metabolic rewiring renders gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cells highly susceptible to inhibition of the rate limiting enzyme of the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), using statins. Notably, statin treatment inhibits the growth of gemcitabine-resistant tumors in immunocompetent mouse models. Through metabolite rescue experiments, we identified geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate as the critical metabolite lost during statin treatment, resulting in reduced protein geranylation in PDAC cells. Finally, as downregulation of the HMGCR is gradually acquired during gemcitabine resistance, we observed that HMGCR expression predicts patient response to gemcitabine. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway represents a promising therapeutic target in gemcitabine resistance and may serve as a biomarker to stratify treatment selection in PDAC patients.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Downy mildew-resistant cultivars have been developed and commercially available since 2018, but observations of isolates overcoming resistance were reported after each new introduction. The rapid development of pathogens overcoming genetic resistance suggests the evolution of new races under selective pressure. In this study, we report on the development of a differential panel of distinct basil cultivars with varying and differential sources of genetic resistance tested against P. belbahrii strains obtained from geographically diverse multi-year collections from basil-producing locations in the US, Israel, and Italy. Screening multiple P. belbahrii isolates revealed three distinct virulence profiles that distinguished race 0, race 1, and race 2. Races 1 and 2 were defined by virulence in cultivars with single gene resistance loci Pb1 and Pb2, respectively. Evaluation of cultivars with quantitative resistance revealed more variation in susceptibility or partial resistance, suggesting broad spectrum (or race-nonspecific) resistance. With continued isolate collection and screening efforts, the denomination of P. belbahrii races may be further expanded, and newly developed resistant cultivars can be added to the proposed panel to definitively evaluate novel P. belbahrii strains. This study lays the groundwork to further explore dynamics of race evolution and mechanisms of resistance breakdown, which will be essential for discovering new sources of resistance for controlling basil downy mildew.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

We measured global transcript half-life in primary chondrocytes from young and old female and young male horses using SLAM-seq.

Our findings demonstrated that age and sex exert distinct regulatory influences on post-transcriptional gene expression in joint tissues. Specifically, ageing alters polyadenylation site usage and transcript turnover in cartilage, even in absence of overt pathology, suggesting that molecular ageing may precede and predispose to joint degeneration. We also found that mean RNA half-life differed significantly between young females and males, with male chondrocytes showing greater transcript stability. This difference suggests that sex-specific regulatory mechanisms may influence RNA stability, which could contribute to differential susceptibility to joint degeneration. Together, these results point to age and sex as key drivers of post-transcriptional regulation with potential roles in shaping joint health trajectories.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}

Despite widespread circulation in domestic cattle, the virus's evolutionary history and global migration dynamics remain poorly understood. This study presents the first comprehensive phylogeographic analysis of IDV using segment 4 (HEF gene) sequences. A time-calibrated Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction suggests a most recent common ancestor around 1998, with the root most likely in the USA or Japan, although data biases limit definitive conclusions. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to assess potential drivers of viral spread, revealing strong associations with cattle trade and shared land borders. However, sequencing efforts heavily influence inferred migration patterns, emphasizing the role of sampling bias in such reconstructions. These findings highlight the mobility of IDV and the critical need for expanded genomic surveillance in underrepresented regions to better detect similar pathogens and understand their transmission dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Subcellular interactions of neuropeptide Y and corticotropin-releasing factor in the central nucleus of the amygdala in the mouse", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.19.677477", "authors": "Yerraguntla, H.; Onyekachi, J.; Giacometti, L. L.; Goldberg, S. L.; Barson, J. R.; Barker, J. M.; Reyes, B. A. S.", "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is ubiquitously distributed throughout the central nervous system. Recognized as a mediator of stress resilience, NPY has been shown to counteract the excitatory effects of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), that orchestrates the stress response. In the mouse, while NPY and CRF exhibit a high degree of neuroanatomical association in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) indicating potential significant interactions, the synaptic organizations of these neuropeptides have not been elucidated. In the present study, we determined the interactions between NPY and CRF in the CeA. Immunofluorescence microscopy presented that NPY-immunoreactive varicose processes were distributed throughout the CeA and contacted CRF-containing neurons. Using electron microscopy, immunoperoxidase labeling for NPY and gold-silver labeling for CRF showed that NPY-labeled axon terminals (NPY-t) form synapses with CRF-labeled dendrites (CRF-d). Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that 163 of NPY-t directly target CRF-d. In addition, approximately 85% of NPY-t form symmetric synapses with CRF-d while approximately 1% form asymmetric synapses. These findings provide the first ultrastructural evidence that NPY-containing axon terminals make direct contact with CRF-containing dendrites in the CeA. This suggests that the CRF-containing neurons in the CeA may be a key site for NPY action, potentially influencing brain regions involved in stress responses and stress-related psychiatric disorders, and alcohol use disorders.", "date": "2025-09-20", "journal": ""}
