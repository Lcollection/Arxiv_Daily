Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, necessitating a unified framework that integrates cognitive, neural, and developmental processes. Leveraging longitudinal neuroimaging and computational modeling to reveal moment-to-moment decision responses and brain state dynamics during working memory (WM), we show that growth mindset enhances WM development from middle childhood to adolescence via nuanced cortico-striatal network dynamics that balance between brain state flexibility and stability. Behaviorally, children with higher growth mindset exhibited better WM performance both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, attributed to faster evidence accumulation during moment-to-moment information updating, especially under high task demands. Neurally, a higher growth mindset was associated with greater activation of the dorsal striatum, cingulo-opercular (action-mode), and fronto-parietal networks during WM, which further accounted for longitudinal WM improvement and latent evidence accumulation. Such cortico-striatal activation covaried with neurochemical mediators critical for motivation and executive functioning. Analyzing non-stationary network dynamics revealed that growth mindset optimized dynamical organization of cortico-striatal networks, with an activated state highly flexible to support moment-to-moment information updating and a deactivated state remaining stable across blocks to suppress irrelevant information. This suggests a balanced allocation of resources for accumulating evidence while suppressing noise during WM. Together, our findings support a neurocognitive framework in which growth mindset enhances WM development via nuanced orchestration of cortico-striatal networks to enable efficient dynamic computations and foster far-reaching cognitive development.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Motor dysfunction is the most debilitating and it is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Increasing evidence suggests that synapse dysfunction precedes neuronal loss by years. Still, early synaptic alterations in PD remain poorly understood. Here we integrate literature meta-analysis, proteomics and phosphoproteomics with biochemical, imaging and electrophysiological measurements in neurons and brains from knockout and knockin Lrrk2 mouse models, as well as human iPSC-derived neurons lacking LRRK2. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser935 and of RAB proteins is induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulation in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and primary mouse neurons. Affinity-purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS/MS) revealed a significant remodelling of the LRRK2 interactome following BDNF treatment, with enhanced association of LRRK2 to a network of actin cytoskeleton-related proteins. Gene-ontology analyses of both literature-curated LRRK2 interactors and phospho-proteome from striatal tissues with elevated LRRK2 activity (G2019S knockin mice) highlight synapse-actin remodelling as major affected pathways. We further observed that loss of LRRK2 impairs BDNF signaling and alters postsynaptic density architecture. One month-old Lrrk2 knockout mice display structural alterations in dendritic protrusions, a phenotype that normalizes with age. In human iPSC-derived neurons, BDNF enhances the frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSC) in wild-type but not in LRRK2 knockout neurons, which appear to bypass this regulation through developmental compensation. Taken together, our study discloses a critical role of LRRK2 in BDNF-dependent synaptic modulation and identifies the synaptic actin cytoskeleton as a convergent site of LRRK2 pathophysiological activity.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Multiple copies of the bacteriophage Lambda P (P) loader bind to and load the E. coli DnaB (B) replicative helicase on replication-origin-derived single-stranded DNA. We find that the E. coli DnaB-Lambda P complex exists in two forms: B6P5 and B6P6. In the 2.66 angstroms cryo-EM model of B6P5, five copies of the Lambda P loader assemble into a crown-like shape that tightly grips DnaB. In this complex, closed planar DnaB is reconfigured into an open spiral with a sufficiently sized breach to permit ssDNA to enter an internal chamber. The transition to the open spiral involves Lambda P-mediated changes to the Docking Helix (DH)-Linker Helix (LH) interface. The loader directly stabilizes the open spiral. Unexpectedly, one Lambda P chain in B6P5 is bound across the breach, precluding entry of replication-origin-derived ssDNA into DnaBs central chamber. We suggest that the B6P6 complex is an early intermediate in the helicase activation pathway wherein neither the DnaB helicase nor the Lambda P loader has attained its final form. DnaB in this complex adopts a partially open planar configuration, termed ajar planar. The partially ordered Lambda P loader assembly features a much looser interaction with DnaB. The ssDNA and ATP sites in both complexes are in a configuration ill-suited for binding or hydrolysis. Our work specifies the conformational changes required for the intermediate B6P6 to transition to B6P5 on the pathway to recruitment by the initiator protein complex to the replication origin.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

A barrier to comprehensive characterization and the study of mechanisms has been the difficulty of annotating large chronic recording datasets. To overcome this barrier, we sought to develop an automated method of classifying sleep-wake states, seizures, and the post-ictal state in mice ranging from controls to mice with severe epilepsy with accompanying background EEG abnormalities. We utilized a large dataset of recordings, including EMG, EEG, and hippocampal local field potentials, from control and intra-amygdala kainic acid-treated mice. We found that an existing sleep-wake classifier performed poorly, even after retraining. A support vector machine, relying on typically used scoring parameters, also performed below our benchmark. We then trained and evaluated several multi-layer neural network architectures and found that a bidirectional long short-term memory-based model performed best. This Sleep-Wake and Ictal State Classifier (SWISC) showed high agreement between ground-truth and classifier scores for all sleep and seizure states in an unseen and unlearned epileptic dataset (average agreement 96.41% {+/-} SD 3.80%), and saline animals (97.77% {+/-} 1.40%). Channel elimination and feature selection provided interpretability and demonstrated that SWISC was primarily dependent on hippocampal signals, yet still maintained good performance (~90% agreement) with EEG alone, thereby expanding the classifier's applicability to other epilepsy datasets. SWISC enables the efficient combined scoring of sleep-wake and seizure states in mouse models of epilepsy and healthy controls, facilitating comprehensive and mechanistic studies of sleep-wake and biological rhythms in epilepsy.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

We find that inhibition of oxidative protein folding inactivates multiple species-specific resistance proteins. Using this strategy, we sensitize multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa to {beta}-lactam antibiotics and demonstrate promise of new treatment avenues for the recalcitrant emerging pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The same approach also inhibits cross-protection between resistant S. maltophilia and susceptible P. aeruginosa, allowing eradication of both commonly co-occurring CF-associated organisms.

R.; Klarevas-Irby, J. A.; Nyaguthii, B.", "abstract": "When dispersing, individuals typically have to make large displacements. While previously thought to be costly, recent work has suggested that individuals can largely mitigate these costs by expressing distinct movement strategies-moving faster and straighter-during dispersal. Several studies have also found that individuals express differences in their habitat preferences during dispersal. These preferences often involve an increased use of open habitats relative to their non-dispersing habitat selection, within which individuals typically achieve larger displacements per unit of time. As a result, it has been suggested, but never explicitly tested, that changes in habitat selection could reflect an increased preference for habitats that facilitate greater energetic efficiency in terms of movement. Here, we combine step-selection analysis with models of the energetics of movement to determine whether actively dispersing vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum) select different habitats relative to their non-dispersing counterparts, and whether their habitat preferences correspond to a decrease in the cost of transport. Our results confirm that fine-scale differences in habitat preferences expressed during the transient stage of dispersal correspond with an increase in the energetic efficiency of movement when making large displacements. These findings highlight the ability for animals to exhibit adaptive movement strategies across different axes of decision-making (e.g., where and how to move) to overcome different ecological challenges.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Laser photoablation-based hydrogel engineering allows the reproduction of vascular networks that are major infection target sites, and this model provides the relevant microenvironment reproducing the physiological endothelial integrity and permeability in vitro. By comparing with a human-skin xenograft mouse model, we show that the model system not only replicates in vivo key features of the infection, but also enables quantitative assessment with a higher spatiotemporal resolution of bacterial microcolony growth, endothelial cytoskeleton rearrangement, vascular E-selectin expression, and neutrophil response upon infection.

Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C, disrupt this balance by weakening the nuclear lamina. This results in nuclear damage in contractile tissues and ultimately muscle disease. Intriguingly, disrupting the LINC complex that connects the cytoskeleton to the nucleus has emerged as a promising strategy to ameliorate LMNA-associated cardiomyopathy. Yet how LINC complex disruption protects the cardiomyocyte nucleus remains unclear. To address this question, we developed an assay to quantify the coupling of cardiomyocyte contraction to nuclear deformation and interrogated its dependence on the nuclear lamina and LINC complex. We found that, surprisingly, the LINC complex was mostly dispensable for transferring contractile strain to the nucleus, and that increased nuclear strain in lamin A/C-deficient cardiomyocytes was not rescued by LINC complex disruption. Instead, LINC complex disruption eliminated the cage of microtubules encircling the nucleus. Disrupting microtubules was sufficient to prevent nuclear damage and rescue cardiac function induced by lamin A/C deficiency. We computationally simulated the stress fields surrounding cardiomyocyte nuclei and show how microtubule forces generate local vulnerabilities that damage lamin A/C-deficient nuclei. Our work pinpoints localized, microtubule-dependent force transmission to the nucleus as a pathological driver and therapeutic target for LMNA-cardiomyopathy.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

We investigated various aspects of cancer lncRNAs, including their expression patterns, genomic locations, and direct interactions with cancer driver PCGs, and developed a pipeline to unearth candidate cancer driver lncRNAs. Finally, we validated the reliability of potential cancer driver lncRNAs through functional analysis of bioinformatics data and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiments. We found that cancer lncRNAs were more concentrated in cancer driver topologically associated domains (CDTs), and CDT is an important feature in identifying cancer lncRNAs. Moreover, cancer lncRNAs showed a high tendency to co-express with and bind to cancer driver PCGs. Utilizing these distinctive characteristics, we developed a pipeline CADTAD to unearth candidate cancer driver lncRNAs in pan-cancer, including 256 oncogenic lncRNAs, 177 tumor suppressive lncRNAs, and 75 dual-function lncRNAs, as well as in three individual cancer types, and validated their cancer-related function.

Plants generate short HSFs (S-HSFs) derived from HSF splicing variants, yet their functions remain poorly understood. While an enhanced canonical HSR confers thermotolerance, its hyperactivation inhibits plant growth. How plants prevent this hyperactivation to ensure proper growth remains unknown. Here, we report that Arabidopsis S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer sensitivity to extreme heat (45 degree ) and constitute new HSF types featuring a unique truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD). This tDBD binds a new heat-regulated element (HRE), which confers minimal promoter heat-responsiveness and exhibits heat stress sensing and transmission patterns. Using S-HsfA2, we investigated whether and how S-HSFs prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation. HSP17.6B, a common direct target of HsfA2 and S-HsfA2, confers thermotolerance; however, its overexpression partially causes HSR hyperactivation. Moreover, HRE-HRE-like and HSE elements mediate the HSP17.6B promoter's heat response. We further show S-HsfA2 alleviates hyperactivation via two mechanisms: 1) S-HsfA2 negatively regulates HSP17.6B via the HRE-HRE-like element, establishing a noncanonical HSR (S-HsfA2-HRE-HSP17.6B) that antagonistically represses HsfA2-activated HSP17.6B expression. 2) S-HsfA2 binds the HsfA2 DBD, preventing HsfA2 from binding HSEs and thereby attenuating HsfA2-activated HSP17.6B promoter activity.

Here, we sampled wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from different age groups during their marine feeding stage and hypothesized that prey taxa (crustaceans versus fish) have an age-dependent effect on the condition factor. We found that salmon in their first year at sea had a higher condition factor when foraging on larger numbers of crustaceans and a lower condition factor when foraging on larger numbers of fish, and vice versa in older sea age groups. Provided that condition factor is a predictor of age-at-maturity, our results show that resource acquisition may be an important process shaping life history variation in Atlantic salmon via modulating age-dependent performance trade-offs.

Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation to study how increased activity of single cells level affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity when the frequency of the presented pure tone matched to their tuning property, while non co-tuned neurons were unaffected. Activity decrease was greater for non-stimulated co-tuned neurons with higher frequency selectivity. Co-tuned and non co-tuned neurons were spatially intermingled. Our results shows that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the larger network. The rebalanced network activity due to external stimulation remained constant.

Its low cytotoxicity enabled the viable labeling and calcium imaging of infected neurons 10 days post-infection, spanning larval ages commonly used for functional examination. Cre-dependent labeling was further developed to enable input cell-type-specific tracing and circuit reconstruction. We mapped cerebellar circuits and uncovered the ipsilateral preference and subtype specificity of granule cell-to-Purkinje cell connections.

Using mass spectrometry and the stable isotope tracing approach, we demonstrated that SLC45A4 promotes GABA de novo synthesis through the Arginine/Ornithine/Putrescine (AOP) pathway.

We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of 'functional connectivity' and 'encoding models', to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs, leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

By introducing bio-orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single-molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead-based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA-4) complex. Multi-regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA-4's center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow.

How these pathways are integrated, particularly when their individual outputs are in conflict, is key to understanding complex natural behaviours. We investigated this question in the visually guided flight of the hummingbird hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. These insects were recently shown to partition their visual field, using ventrolateral optic-flow cues to guide their flight like most insects, while the same stimuli in the dorsal visual field evoke a novel directional response. Using behavioural experiments which set the two pathways into conflict, we tested whether and how the ventrolateral and dorsal pathway integrate to guide hawkmoth flight. Combined with environmental imaging we demonstrate that the partitioning of the visual field followed the prevalence of visual cues in the hawkmoths' natural habitats, while the integration hierarchy of the two pathways matched the relevance of these cues for the animals' flight safety, rather than their magnitude in the experimental setup or in natural habitats. These results provide new mechanistic insights into the vision-based flight control of insects, and link these to their natural context.

Here, we examine AcrIF11, a widespread phage and plasmid-encoded ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) that inhibits the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. We present an NMR structure of an AcrIF11 homolog that reveals chemical shift perturbations consistent with NAD (cofactor) binding. In experiments that model both lytic phage replication and MGE/lysogen stability under high targeting pressure, AcrIF11 is a highly potent CRISPR-Cas inhibitor and more robust to Cas protein level fluctuations than stoichiometric inhibitors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AcrIF11 is remarkably specific, predominantly ADP-ribosylating Csy1 when expressed in P. aeruginosa. Given the reversible nature of ADP-ribosylation, we hypothesized that ADPr eraser enzymes (macrodomains) could remove ADPr from Csy1, a potential limitation of PTM-based CRISPR inhibition. We demonstrate that diverse macrodomains can indeed remove the modification from Csy1 in P. aeruginosa lysate.

A recently proposed framework argued for testing three animals and accepting the outcome found in the majority as the outcome that is most representative for the population. The proposal tests this framework under various assumptions about the true probability of the representative outcome in the population, i.e. its typicality. On this basis, it argues that the framework is valid across a wide range of typicalities. Here, we show (1) that the error rate of the framework depends strongly on the typicality of the representative outcome, (2) that an acceptable error rate requires this typicality to be very high (87% for a single type of outlier), which actually renders empirical testing beyond a single animal obsolete, (3) that moving from one to three animals decreases error rates mainly for typicality values of 70-90%, and much less for both lower and higher values. Furthermore, we use conjunction analysis to demonstrate that two out of three animals with a given outcome only allow to infer a lower bound to typicality of 9%, which is of limited value.

We previously found that interaction with different somatic niches regulates PGC proliferation along the migration route. To characterize transcriptional heterogeneity of migrating PGCs and their niches, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 13,262 mouse PGCs and 7,868 surrounding somatic cells during migration (E9.5, E10.5, E11.5) and in anterior versus posterior locations to enrich for leading and lagging migrants. Analysis of PGCs by position revealed dynamic gene expression changes between faster or earlier migrants in the anterior and slower or later migrants in the posterior at E9.5; these differences include migration-associated actin polymerization machinery and epigenetic reprogramming-associated genes. We furthermore identified changes in signaling with various somatic niches, notably strengthened interactions with hindgut epithelium via non-canonical WNT (ncWNT) in posterior PGCs compared to anterior. Reanalysis of a previously published dataset suggests that ncWNT signaling from the hindgut epithelium to early migratory PGCs is conserved in humans. Trajectory inference methods identified putative differentiation trajectories linking cell states across timepoints and from posterior to anterior in our mouse dataset. At E9.5, we mainly observed differences in cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics between E9.5 posterior and anterior migrants. At E10.5, we observed divergent gene expression patterns between putative differentiation trajectories from posterior to anterior including Nodal signaling response genes Lefty1, Lefty2, and Pycr2 and reprogramming factors Dnmt1, Prc1, and Tet1. At E10.5, we experimentally validated anterior migrant-specific Lefty1/2 upregulation via whole-mount immunofluorescence staining for LEFTY1/2 and phosphorylated SMAD2/3, suggesting that elevated autocrine Nodal signaling in migrating PGCs occurs as they near the gonadal ridges.

In this study, we employed a full factorial experimental design to investigate the effects of isocaloric diets (diets with equal caloric content but differing macronutrient composition) on key life-history traits in an outbred Drosophila melanogaster population. Our results demonstrated significant diet-induced plasticity, with male wing length (a proxy for body size) being influenced by the developmental diet; males reared on carbohydrate-rich developmental diets had larger wings as adults. Fertility increased with protein-rich diets at both developmental and adult stages, reaffirming the critical role of dietary protein in enhancing reproductive success. Lifespan exhibited sexually dimorphic responses to diet: carbohydrate-rich developmental diets extended male lifespan, while carbohydrate-rich adult diets reduced lifespan in both sexes. Stress resistance traits, including starvation and desiccation resistance, were unaffected by developmental diets but were influenced by adult diets, with carbohydrate-rich adult diets enhancing survival under both stress conditions in males and females. Importantly, while most traits exhibited additive effects of nutrition across life stages, a marginal interaction for male starvation resistance suggests that developmental and adult diets can interact in a trait- and sex-specific manner. Moreover, associations between dietary effects on life-history traits were context-dependent, driven primarily by adult diets and varying by sex. These findings emphasize the profound role of stage-specific nutritional environments in modulating life-history traits and their correlations, offering valuable insights into how organisms may adapt to changing ecological conditions and highlighting the importance of considering both developmental and adult dietary contexts in evolutionary studies.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

However, its auto-replicative nature mimics viral infection, triggering innate immune responses that shut down cap-dependent translation, degrade cellular mRNA, induce cell death, and release cytokines. In non-immunotherapy applications, this immune activation is undesirable as it limits transgene expression, induces unintended changes in host gene expression, depletes transfected cells, and promotes inflammation--ultimately undermining therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the use of exogenous immune suppressants to mitigate these effects often increases treatment complexity and the risk of unintended systemic side effects. To address these challenges, we developed a strategy to encode broad-spectrum innate immune suppression directly within saRNA. This approach leverages cap-independent translation to bypass saRNA-triggered translation shutdown, enabling the expression of multiple inhibitors targeting diverse double-stranded RNA-sensing and inflammatory signalling pathways. In mouse primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes--key cells in joint pathologies--this strategy eliminates the need for external immune inhibitors, reduces cytotoxicity and antiviral cytokine secretion, and enables sustained transgene expression that can be controlled with a small-molecule antiviral. Together, these findings support the development of reversible 'immune-evasive saRNA' constructs for transient gene therapy applications that avoid persistent immune activation and eliminate the need for external immune suppressants.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

MARLOWE produces a list of potential source organisms given confident peptide tags derived from de novo peptide sequencing and a statistical approach to assign peptides to organisms in a probabilistic manner, based on a broad sequence database. In this way, the algorithm assumes no a priori knowledge of potential sources, and the probabilistic way peptides are taxonomically assigned and then scored enables results to be unbiased (within the constraints of the sequence database). In a proof-of-concept study, we examined MARLOWE's performance on two datasets, the Biodiversity dataset and the Bacillus cereus superspecies dataset. Not only did MARLOWE demonstrate successful characterization to true contributors in single source and binary mixtures in the Biodiversity dataset, but also provided sufficient specificity to distinguish species within a bacterial superspecies group. We also compared MARLOWE's results to those of MiCId, a leading microbial identification/characterization tool based on proteomics database search. Comparison of the two tools using 225 mass spectrometry data files yielded comparable performance, with slightly higher accuracy and specificity for MiCId. At the species level, MARLOWE achieved a specificity of 91.4% at 5% FDR.

Experiment 1 was a reaction time task (n=29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person) and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n=50) used the same stimuli in a \"Forced Response\" paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer reaction times and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, while anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream.

V.; Miller, L. E.; Bensmaia, S. J.", "abstract": "The transition from opening your hand to grasping a coffee cup happens smoothly, yet the neural systems supporting this behavior go through a significant state shift at the onset of grasp. At this moment, the motor system begins to control contact forces and the somatosensory system receives a barrage of cutaneous signals that convey information about contact forces and the object's local features (e.g., edges, texture, and curvature). These cutaneous signals supplement the ongoing flow of proprioceptive input that encodes hand posture. It is unclear whether the neural signals representing object identity persist unchanged through this transition. In the present study, we sought to quantify the object-specific neural signals in the activity of individual neurons of the primary motor cortex (M1) and Brodmann areas 3a, 3b/1, and 2 of the somatosensory cortex in macaque monkeys. We found that, although the firing rates of individual neurons in each area declined rapidly after the object was grasped, this did not reduce the information they carried about the grasped object. On the contrary, it reflected a consolidation of object-specific information within sensorimotor cortex. The exception was proprioceptive area 3a, whose neurons were most informative right before contact and slightly less so after the object was securely held. In contrast, both individual neurons and population activity in cutaneous areas 3b and 1 carried little object-specific information before contact but became highly informative afterward. Population-level analyses further revealed that multimodal area 2, which receives both cutaneous and musculotendinous inputs, does not represent object identity stronger than areas 3b and 1. Although area 2 showed higher activity before contact, this activity lacked task-relevant information, suggesting that uninformative cutaneous inputs may have interfered with informative proprioceptive signals. Following object contact, however, area 2 became highly informative, consistent with its proposed role in haptic object perception. In contrast, only M1 and area 3a carried object-specific information before contact. However, neither region appeared to encode a generalizable object representation, indicating a likely integration of force-related signals with postural information. Together, these findings underscore the profound effects of object contact on the neural representation of object identity in sensorimotor cortex.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

The mean phenotypic values over time will thus predominantly be determined by the environment over time, and the trait history may be found in the fossil record. Here, I simulate such a tracking system, using both a basic non-plastic selection model and a univariate intercept-slope reaction norm model. I show how both linear and nonlinear mean phenotype vs. environment functions can be found also from quite sparse and short time series from the fossil record, and I discuss how this methodology can be extended to multivariate systems. The simulations include cases with a constraint on the individual trait values and with other factors than environment influencing the position of the adaptive peak. The methodology is finally applied on a time series of mean phenotypic values in a record of bryozoan Microporella agonistes fossils spanning 2.3 million years, using the {partial}^18 O measure as proxy for sea water temperature. From as few as nine samples of mean phenotypic values found in the fossil record it was possible to identify a linear mean phenotype vs. environment function, and to predict the continuous mean phenotypic values as functions of time with prediction errors within or just outside the standard errors of the observations.

Several recent studies have argued that pairwise interactions may be insufficient to explain co-occurrence patterns in complex microbial communities, but most such studies have focused on synthetic communities not found in nature or microbes grown in contexts that differ widely from their natural environment. Moreover, most models of pairwise interactions rely on equilibrium assumptions that are not relevant to all natural communities, such as gut microbiomes or species in fluctuating environments. Inclusion of appropriate demographic factors into models of pairwise interactions could be a potential approach to better capture patterns of community assembly. In this study, we investigated whether multi-species co-occurrence patterns can be predicted from pairwise interactions for microbes isolated from sourdough starters. Interaction parameters inferred from pairwise growth trajectories were suggestive of widespread coexistence between pairs of microbes in our species pool. In communities of up to nine species, most species' presence and relative abundance could be reliably predicted based on a model of pairwise interactions.

Amongst them, the abnormal expression of several microRNAs arising from lack of antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 (encoded by Nfe2l2) leads to cancer metastasis. However, much less known is about regulation of microRNAs by Nrf1 (encoded by Nfe2l1), even though it acts as an essential determinon of cell homeostasis by governing the transcriptional expression of those driver genes contributing to the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) involved in its metastasis. In this study, distinctive EMT phenotypes were unveiled to result from specific knockout of Nrf1 and Nrf2 in HepG2 cells, as accompanied by differential migratory and invasive capabilities. The Nrf1leading EMT results from a significantly decrease in the epithelial CDH1 expression, plus another increased expression of the mesenchymal CDH2. Such distinct phenotypes of Nrf1 from Nrf2 cell lines were also attributable to differential regulation of two key microRNAs, i.e., miR3187/3P and miR1247/5p. Further experiments unraveled that Nrf1 activates the expression of miR/3187/3p, directly targeting for the inhibition of SNAI1, leading to CDH1 activation but CDH2 inhibition insomuch as to prevent the process of EMT. By contrast, Nrf2 inhibits the expression of miR1247/5p, relieving its inhibitory effect on MMP15 and MMP17 to promote the EMT. Collectively, these demonstrate that the EMT of liver cancer cells is likely prevented by Nrf1 via the miR3187/3P signaling to the SNAI1/CDH1/2 axis, but conversely promoted by Nrf2 through the miR1247/5p/MMP15/17 signaling axis.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

However, the genetic background upon which these models are built, particularly the widely used w1118 white-eyed mutant, can significantly influence baseline ERG characteristics. This study systematically characterizes ERG responses in wild-type Canton S (CS), w1118, and a w1118 line carrying a UAS-hPLD1 construct (which includes a mini-white gene). We demonstrate profound differences in ERG amplitudes, waveforms, and responses to varying light stimuli (intensity and duration) between these genotypes, as well as significant sex-specific variations. Notably, w1118 flies exhibit markedly larger ERG amplitudes compared to CS, while the hPLD1 line shows partial compensation. We also introduce a novel quadrant-based analysis of the receptor potential, revealing distinct \"fingerprints\" for each genotype. These findings underscore that the w1118 background is not electrophysiologically neutral and can intrinsically alter neuronal responses. This has critical implications for interpreting ERG data from neurodegeneration models, as these background effects could mask or mimic disease-related changes. Researchers must consider these baseline differences and potential sex-specific effects to accurately attribute observed ERG phenotypes to the gene or condition under investigation.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Recent evidence suggests that chronic changes in the microenvironment and local paracrine signaling are major drivers of these effects, but the precise effect of aging on these factors remains understudied. Here, for the first time, we directly compare extracellular vesicles obtained from young and aged patients to identify therapeutic or disease-associated agents, and directly compare vesicles isolated from heart tissue matrix (TEVs) or plasma (PEVs). While young TEVs and PEVs showed notable overlap of miRNA cargo, aged EVs differed substantially, indicating differential aging-related changes between TEVs and PEVs. TEVs overall were uniquely enriched in miRNAs which directly or indirectly demonstrate cardioprotective effects, with 45 potential therapeutic agents identified in our analysis. Both populations also showed increased predisposition to disease with aging, though through different mechanisms. Changes in PEV cargo were largely correlated with chronic systemic inflammation, while those in TEVs were more related to cardiac homeostasis and local inflammation. From this, 17 protein targets were identified which were unique to TEVs and highly correlated with aging and the onset of cardiovascular disease. Further analysis via machine learning techniques implicated several new miRNA and protein targets, independently suggesting several of the targets identified by non-machine learning analysis, which correlated with aging-related changes in TEVs. With further study, this biomarker set may serve as a powerful, potential indicator of cardiac health and age which can be measured from PEVs. Additionally, several proposed young-enriched therapeutic agents were validated and, when tested, could successfully prevent cell death and cardiac fibrosis in disease-like conditions.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

On one side, the pathogen harvests nutrients at the expense of the plant to sustain its growth and virulence. On the other side, the plant tries to prevent pathogen multiplication by competing for nutrients or using anti-microbial compounds. Plants and pathogens have thus contrary objectives in an intertwined system that is particularly difficult to untangle experimentally. To help decipher this interaction, we used genome-scale metabolic modeling by combining a multi-organ model of a plant, a model of a pathogen, quantitative data and a mathematical approach using sequential flux balance analyses (FBAs). We applied this modeling strategy to the interaction between the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum and its natural host, the tomato plant. This allowed, for the first time, quantitative modeling of the fluxes of matter occurring during plant infection. The model showed that, for the pathosystem studied, i) the plant's photosynthetic capacity is a more stringent environmental condition than minerals for bacterial proliferation ii) reduction of the plant transpiration is what limits and then stops plant growth and later pathogen growth, iii) hijacking stem resources can boost bacterial growth but is accessory, and iv) pathogen-excreted putrescine is predicted to be directly reused for plant biomass. This study provides the first holistic and quantitative view of a plant-pathogen interaction, and highlights the criticality of water flow when the bacteria responsible of the infection is a fast-growing, xylem-colonizing one.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

But how VPC neurons process and integrate information from these two sensory modalities during perception remains unknown. To investigate this, we recorded the activity of VPC neurons in two trained monkeys performing a bimodal detection task (BDT). In the BDT, subjects reported the presence or absence of a tactile or an acoustic stimulus. Initial single-cell analyses revealed a diverse range of responses during the BDT: purely tactile, purely acoustic, bimodal and others that exhibited sustained activity during the decision maintenance delay, between the stimulus offset and motor report. To further explore the VPC's role in the BDT, we applied dimensionality reduction techniques to uncover the low-dimensional latent dynamics of the neuronal population and conducted parallel analyses on a recurrent neural network (RNN) model trained on the same task. Neural trajectories associated with tactile responses diverged strongly from those related to acoustic responses. Conversely, during the stimulus-absent trials the neural dynamics remained at rest. During the delay, the trajectories demonstrated a pronounced rotational dynamic toward a subspace orthogonal to the sensory response space, supporting memory maintenance in stable equilibria. This suggests that the network dynamics can sustain distinct stable states corresponding to the three potential task outcomes. Using low-dimensional modeling, we propose a universal dynamical mechanism underlying the transition from sensory to mnemonic processing, consistent with our experimental and computational observations. These findings show that the VPC contains neurons capable of bimodal coding and that its population can integrate competing sensory information and maintain decisions throughout the delay period, regardless of the sensory modality.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Two sympatric species of Rimicaris shrimps occur at vents on the Izu-Bonin-Mariana volcanic arc: Rimicaris loihi also occurs near Hawaii and R. cambonae is present on the Tonga Arc. These two species biogeographically co-occur and are genetically similar, raising questions about their speciation mechanism, how they maintain distinct species, and whether interbreeding occurs. Here, we use barcoding and shotgun sequencing to test their genetic isolation and investigate their speciation process. We also evaluate population demography over 10 years to assess population densities and sex ratios at vents. Our results support R. cambonae and R. loihi as two distinct species despite sympatry throughout part of their range. We also observed regional-scale genetic structure among R. loihi populations from the Izu-Bonin-Mariana volcanic arc despite their broad geographic distribution. Finally, we found concomitant variations of shrimp densities and genetic diversity following fluctuations in geological and venting activities over a decade. A combination of geological instability, ocean currents dynamics and sea-level changes might drive temporary isolation among these local populations. We suggest similar factors, with longer isolation periods, may also have promoted speciation between the two Rimicaris species whereas distinct life-history traits could strengthen and maintain reproductive barriers. Overall, our results indicate different connectivity patterns on a volcanic arc that contrast with those observed previously at vents from mid-ocean ridges or back-arc basins systems.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

J.; Parent, L. J.", "abstract": "Retroviruses cause significant diseases in humans and animals, including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and a wide range of malignancies. A crucial yet poorly understood step in the replication cycle is the recognition and selection of unspliced viral RNA (USvRNA) by the retroviral Gag protein, which binds to the psi packaging sequence in the 5 primer leader, to package it as genomic RNA (gRNA) into nascent virions. It was previously thought that Gag initially bound gRNA in the cytoplasm. However, previous studies demonstrated that the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Gag protein traffics transiently through the nucleus, which is necessary for efficient gRNA packaging. These data formed a strong premise for the hypothesis that Gag selects nascent gRNA at transcription sites in the nucleus, the highest concentration of USvRNA molecules in the cell. To test this hypothesis, we used single molecule labeling and imaging techniques to visualize fluorescently-tagged, actively transcribing viral genomes, and Gag proteins in living cells. Gag foci were observed in the nucleus, transiently co-localizing with USvRNA at transcriptional burst sites, and forming viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). Furthermore, we found that RSV Gag interacts with Med26 and CTCF in the nucleus, suggesting a possible role for these factors in trafficking Gag to transcription sites. These results support a novel paradigm for retroviral assembly in which Gag traffics to transcriptional burst sites and interacts with nascent USvRNA through a dynamic kissing interaction to capture gRNA for incorporation into virions.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Whereas some iflaviruses cause severe diseases in insects, numerous iflaviruses that were detected in healthy populations of butterflies and moths (order: Lepidoptera) do not show apparent symptoms. Compared to other hosts, only few iflavirus genomes for lepidopteran hosts could be found in publicly available databases and we know little about the occurrence of iflaviruses in natural and laboratory lepidopteran populations. To expand the known diversity of iflaviruses in Lepidoptera, we developed a pipeline to automatically reconstruct virus genomes from public transcriptome data. We reconstructed 1,548 virus genomes from 55 different lepidopteran species that we were identified as coding-complete based on their length. To include incompletely assembled genomes, we developed a reference-based patching approach, resulting in 240 patched genomes. By including publicly available genomes, we inferred a phylogeny consisting of 139 non-redundant iflavirus genomes. Of these, 65 represent novel complete genomes, of which 39 might even belong to novel virus species. Our analysis expanded virus host range, where highly similar viruses were found in the transcriptomes of different lepidopteran species, genera or even families. Additionally, we find two groups of lepidopteran species depending on the diversity of viruses that infect them: some species were only infected by closely related viruses, whereas other species are infected by highly diverse viruses from different regions of the phylogeny. Finally, we show that the evolution of one virus species, Iflavirus betaspexiguae, is impacted by recombination within the species, which is also supported by the co-occurrence of multiple strains within data sets. Our analysis demonstrates how data mining of publicly available sequencing data can be used at a large scale to reconstruct intra-family viral diversity which serves as a basis to study virus host range and evolution.

Here, we used physical dividers and varied inter-plant distances (3-24 cm) in soybean to isolate competitive interactions while controlling for these confounding effects. Simultaneous above- and belowground competition increased relative root allocation, but reduced total biomass. Aboveground competition alone had stronger effects, triggering shade avoidance and reducing both shoot and root biomass. This likely overrode belowground cues.

POCALI identified secondary structure and gene expression-related features as strong predictors of cancer lncRNAs, and epigenomic features as moderate predictors. POCALI performed better than other methods, especially in terms of sensitivity, and predicted more candidates. Novel POCALI-predicted cancer lncRNAs had strong relationships with cancer phenotypes, similar to known cancer lncRNAs.

Here, we used brain-wide transcriptomic profiling to define the molecular landscape of parity-induced neural plasticity, identifying the dorsal hippocampal formation (dHF) as a key site of transcriptional remodeling. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing with a maternal-pup separation paradigm, we additionally demonstrated that chronic postpartum stress significantly disrupts dHF adaptations by altering dopamine dynamics, leading to changes in the dopamine-dependent histone post-translational modification - H3 dopaminylation, with further alterations in transcription, cellular plasticity, and behavior. In human dorsal subiculum, a brain structure within the dHF, we uncovered conserved patterns of parity-dependent alterations in H3 dopaminylation and transcription. We further established the sufficiency of dopamine modulation in regulating these parity-induced adaptations via chemogenetic suppression of dopamine release into the dHF, which recapitulated key epigenomic and behavioral features of parity in virgin female mice. In sum, our findings establish dopamine as a central regulator of parity-induced neuroadaptations in humans and mice, revealing a fundamental transcriptional mechanism by which female reproductive experiences remodel the brain to sustain long-term behavioral adaptations.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Targeting the ALT is of growing interest as a cancer therapy, yet a substantial knowledge gap remains regarding the basic features of telomeres in ALT-positive cells. To address this, we adopted END-seq, an unbiased sequencing-based approach, to define the identity and regulation of the terminal sequences of chromosomes in ALT cells. Our data reveal that the terminal portions of chromosomes in ALT cells contain canonical telomeric sequences with the same 5-prime terminus bias (-ATC) observed in non-ALT cells. Furthermore, as reported for non-ALT cells, POT1 is required to preserve the precise regulation of the 5-prime end in cells that maintain telomere length using the ALT pathway. Thus, the regulation of the terminal 5-prime of chromosomes occurs independently of the mechanism of telomere elongation. Additionally, we employed an S1 endonuclease-based sequencing method to determine the presence and origin of single-stranded regions within ALT telomeres.

Higher anticipated rewards lead to greater desynchronisation of alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (20-30Hz) oscillations, which in turn correlated with improved task performance. Both alpha power and event-related potential (ERP) coding of reward independently predicted reward-based performance improvements, suggesting distinct mechanisms supporting proactive control.

In the first stage, before birth in primates and before eye opening in altricial mammals, spontaneous activity generated by the retina and cortex shapes visual brain circuits in an activity-dependent but experience-independent manner. In the second stage, visual activity generated by sensory experience refines receptive fields. Here we investigated the consequences of altering this sequence of events by prematurely opening one or both eyes of ferrets and examining visual receptive fields in monocular cortex after the closure of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. We observed that many cells in animals with prematurely-opened eyes exhibited low-pass temporal frequency tuning and increased temporal frequency bandwidths, and these cells showed slightly increased orientation and direction selectivity index values. Spontaneous activity was greatly elevated in both hemispheres following the premature opening of one or both eyes, suggesting a global change in circuit excitability that was not restricted to cells that viewed the world through the prematurely opened eye. No major changes were noted in spatial frequency tuning. These results suggest that premature visual experience alters circuit excitability and visual receptive fields, in particular with respect to temporal processing. We speculate that closed lids in altricial mammals serve to prevent visual experience until circuits are initially established and are ready to be refined by visual experience.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

ELIC activation and desensitization were confirmed in liposomes with a stopped-flow thallium flux assay. Using WT ELIC and a non-desensitizing mutant (ELIC5), we captured resting, activated and desensitized structures at high resolution. In the desensitized structure, the ion conduction pore has a constriction at the 9' leucine of the pore-lining M2 helix, indicating that 9' is the desensitization gate in ELIC. The agonist-bound structures of ELIC in liposomes are distinct from those in nanodiscs. In general, the transmembrane domain is more loosely packed in liposomes compared to nanodiscs. It has been suggested that large nanodiscs are superior for supporting membrane protein function. However, ELIC localizes to the rim of large circularized nanodiscs, and structures of ELIC in large nanodiscs deviate from the liposome structures more than those in small nanodiscs.

Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has opened a new window for mesoscopic (<0.5 mm) imaging of angioarchitecture, revealing fine vascular details that were previously inaccessible in vivo. However, current mesoscopic MRI methods for imaging of the angioarchitecture face two major limitations. First, acquisition times are prohibitively long -often exceeding 40 minutes -making integration into everyday clinical practice and research projects impractical. Second, even with data successfully acquired, conventional data visualization methods- such as 2D slice browsing and 3D vessel segmentation renders- are rudimentary and have limited effectiveness for navigating and interpreting the complex vascular network.

We demonstrate that, with these advancements, we can reproduce the seminal postmortem vasculature images of Duvernoy and Vannson (1999) in vivo. Furthermore, leveraging the fact that MRI allows coverage of the entire brain, we achieve, for the first time, whole-brain intracortical mesoscopic vein maps in humans.

A minority of miRNAs are generated via noncanonical biogenesis pathways that bypass the Microprocessor and/or Dicer. Here, we describe a new Pol III-dependent, Microprocessor -independent, and Dicer-dependent biogenesis pathway exemplified by the mir-1829 family in C. elegans.

Decolonization with the topical antibiotic mupirocin is effective and reduces the risk of subsequent S. aureus infection for both methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains but may select for mupirocin-resistant isolates. Methods: We characterized oxacillin and mupirocin susceptibility amongst 384 S. aureus strains isolated from clinical samples isolated 2017-2023 in Tampa, Florida, spanning strains collected before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whole genome sequencing of bacterial isolates was conducted in parallel and correlated with drug susceptibility profiles. Results: Mupirocin resistance (MupR) was nearly exclusively present in MRSA strains (103/106 97.1% of MupR; 103/299 34.4% of MRSA). Although our hospital protocol for decolonization shifted to povidone iodine in the Post-COVID period, the overall prevalence of MupR did not change in Pre-COVID and Post-COVID samples (28.9% vs 26%). Genotype correlated with antibiotic susceptibility with low level MupR (MupLR), linked to mutations in ileS and high level MupR (MupHR), linked to the presence of mupA. Genome analysis revealed that most MupR strains fell into three sequence types (ST) falling into two major clonal complexes (CC): CC8 ST8 (including Community-Associated MRSA strains USA300 and USA500), CC5 ST5 (associated with Healthcare-Associated MRSA such as USA100), and CC5 ST3390. ST3390 isolates had the highest prevalence of MupR (30/36 83%; MupHR 20/36 55.6%; MupLR 10/36 27.8%). Conclusions: Mupirocin resistance was prevalent in our hospital MRSA strains. We also found evidence for emergence and persistence of ST3390 MRSA-MupR strains in Florida.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Despite reductions of clinical malaria by 12%, and vector density by 22% in the ITN-PPF arm, we found no significant changes in An. gambiae population genetic structure or diversity. We found remarkably low population differentiation, and a lack of discernible clustering by treatment, time, or space. Nucleotide diversity and inbreeding coefficient remained stable between treatments, and genome-wide scans showed no putative signatures of selection between trial arms. These results show that ITN-PPF did not alter An. gambiae genetic structure, possibly due to large, vagile populations in West Africa. More widely, this is first evidence that epidemiologically meaningful reductions in vector density may not impact genetic diversity or connectivity, and challenges what constitutes adequate vector control in large populations.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

We found that the vln4 mutation greatly exacerbated the growth and subcellular defects in vln2 vln3. Compared to the wild-type cells, the double and triple vln mutants exhibit progressive reduction of stable F-actin bundles and rapid remodeling of the fine filaments. The defective F-actin network did not prevent peroxisomes from taking on both rapid and slow movements along the tracks but caused significantly reduced speed of movement and displacement distance of peroxisomes. Using a correlation analysis method, we classified the complex heterogeneous peroxisome movement patterns into clusters reflecting distinct movement directionalities. The vln triple mutant had significantly reduced number of peroxisomes with long-range and linear movement.

Here, we addressed this question by analyzing rates of RNA abundance change, RNA half-lives (t1/2s), and transcription rates in stimulated Arabidopsis leaf cells. This revealed three mechanisms by which decay influenced RNA abundance changes. First, the biggest changes in RNA abundances resulted from t1/2 changes that reinforced transcriptional regulation (synergistic). Modest RNA abundance changes arose from a second mechanism in which t1/2 changes opposed transcriptional regulation (oppositional). Finally, RNA decay alone also contributed to RNA abundance change, and RNA decays measured capacity influence RNA abundances was similar to that of transcription. RNA decay also contributed to transcriptome homeostasis through stimulus-induced RNA buffering. Oppositional and buffering regulation shared key features, including excessive and commensurate rate changes, which suggested use of a shared regulatory mechanism which we call countercyclical regulation. In this study, countercyclical regulation was widespread and used for regulation of 90% of the RNAs with t1/2 regulation.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Yet, interpreting eNA detections requires understanding of their environmental persistence. We conducted a decay experiment using seawater from an open enclosure to track degradation of six eNA components derived from Tursiops truncatus: mitochondrial eDNA of varying lengths, ribosomal eRNA, and messenger eRNA. Targets were quantified over seven days via digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Decay followed a biphasic exponential model with rapid initial loss (~24 hours at 15C), followed by slower degradation. Cytb messenger eRNA was least stable, disappearing within four hours. Ribosomal eRNA persisted longer but degraded slightly faster than its eDNA counterpart ({lambda}1=0.236 vs. 0.165hr-1). Longest eDNA fragments decayed more rapidly ({lambda}1=0.190 hr-1) than shorter ones ({lambda}1=0.114 hr-1). These findings support the use of eDNA fragment length as a proxy for degradation state and reinforce that combining multiple eNA components with distinct stabilities can potentially provide a molecular clock for inferring eNA age. This approach improves the spatiotemporal resolution of eNA-based monitoring, particularly for rare marine-mammal that act as point sources.

CB1 is widely expressed in various hippocampal cell types. While it is known that CB1 participates in memory processes, its specific roles in different cell types and how these roles may differ between sexes remain unclear. This study investigates how CB1 signaling in the hippocampus, in both, cell-type-specific and sex-dependent manner, contributes to navigation and memory. To this end, we selectively deleted CB1 receptors from neurons, CAMKII-expressing neurons, and astrocytes from the hippocampus of adult male and female mice. We then assessed its effect on a broad range of behaviors, including innate emotional responses, memory, navigation, and other hippocampus-related functions such as nesting. Deletion of CB1 in CAMKII-expressing neurons produced a pronounced effect in males, leading to increased anxiety and impairments in both reference and spatial memory. These mice also showed altered performance in the Barnes maze, relying less on spatial strategies. By contrast, females were less affected by this specific deletion. Interestingly, only deletion of CB1 from astrocytes led to spatial memory impairments in females, which also showed reduced LTP and a decreased reliance on spatial strategies in the Barnes maze. In conclusion, our findings show that neuronal CB1 receptors are critical for the spatial navigation strategy in males, while astrocytic CB1 receptors play a key role in memory processes both in males and females.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

While prior studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of perceptual and conceptual object properties in the neural signal, it remains unclear whether and when contextual associations are uniquely represented. In this study, we used representational similarity analysis on electroencephalography (EEG) data to explore how the brain processes the perceptual, conceptual, and contextual dimensions of object knowledge over time. Using human similarity judgments of 190 naturalistic object concepts presented as either as images or words, we constructed separate behavioural models of objects' perceptual, conceptual, and contextual properties. We correlated these models with neural patterns from two EEG datasets, one publicly available and one newly collected, both recorded while participants passively viewed the same object stimuli. Across both datasets, we found that perceptual features dominated the early EEG response to object images, while conceptual features emerged later. Contextual associations were also reflected in neural patterns, but their explanatory power largely overlapped with that of conceptual models, suggesting limited unique representation of objects' contextual attributes under passive viewing conditions. These results highlight the brain's integration of perceptual and conceptual information when processing visual objects.

They rely on the formation of specific contacts between amino acid and nucleotide residues. Accurate detection and classification of these inter-residue contacts in both experimentally determined structures and computationally predicted models of nucleic acid-protein complexes are crucial for achieving a comprehensive, molecular-level understanding of nucleic acid-protein recognition mechanisms. Here, we present ClaPNAC, a classifier that annotates 3D structures of nucleic acid-protein complexes with pairwise contacts. It distinguishes stacking interactions (involving the faces of nucleobases), pseudo pairs (involving the Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen, or sugar edge of the base), and phosphate and ribose interactions on the nucleoside/nucleotide side, as well as side chain and backbone interactions on the amino acid side. ClaPNAC is based on a geometric approach, extending our previous method ClaRNA and uses a database of pre-classified doublets extracted from experimentally solved RNA-protein complex structures. Unlike other tools that focus on specific chemical interactions such as hydrogen bonds or van der Waals contacts, ClaPNAC relies on the geometry of the interacting residues. It is applicable to both RNA- and DNA-protein complexes, and it can also operate on isolated nucleosides/nucleotides and amino acids. It can be extended to support additional interaction types and higher-order spatial relationships. ClaPNAC constitutes a notable advancement in the characterization of amino acid-nucleotide interactions by providing a comprehensive classification framework that deepens our insight into these fundamental biological processes.

They photoswitch between red light absorbing (Pr) and far-red light absorbing (Pfr) states, however, thermal reversion in the dark is an equally important factor in controlling their signaling levels. Phytochromes are generally dimeric proteins, and mixed PrPfr states are therefore possible. These states have been implied in the dark reversion studies of plant phytochromes, but not in bacterial phytochromes. Here, we investigate the dark reversion kinetics of the  bathy phytochrome from P. aeruginosa (PaBphP) using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. A single set of time-resolved spectra does not conclusively reveal the presence of a mixed PrPfr state, as both a direct Pr[-&gt;] Pfr model or a sequential Pr[-&gt;] PrPfr[-&gt;] Pfr model fit the spectral kinetics. However, a systematic analysis of dark reversion kinetics with varying Pr/Pfr ratios can only be satisfactorily fit by the sequential model, which indicates the presence of an intermediate PrPfr state. A newly designed monomeric variant of PaBphP provides strong support for this interpretation. Temperature-dependent kinetics revealed similarly low activation energies for the dark reversion processes of both proteins, consistent with a previously proposed keto-enol tautomerization preceding dark reversion.

However, gene delivery to renal tubule epithelial cells mediated by viral vectors via the blood is inefficient due to the permselectivity of the glomerular barrier. We hypothesized that effacement of podocyte foot processes would disrupt typical glomerular limitations on filtration and make renal tubule epithelial cells susceptible to transduction from viral vectors delivered intravenously. We determined that adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) transduced significantly more epithelial cells in the kidney under the conditions of LPS-induced proteinuria. Use of AAV1 in tandem with LPS-induced proteinuria yielded an ideal two-pronged effect of both partially detargeting the liver and transducing the kidney with a higher bioluminescent signal than AAV8 did, and at half of the dose. Using adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) in conjunction with LPS-induced proteinuria showed that kidney transduction was enhanced, but only in glomerular cells. These studies mechanistically test the efficacy of different viral vectors and demonstrate their capacity to transduce kidney epithelial cells. This is a fundamental step in designing future treatments for kidney gene therapy.\n\nSignificance StatementThe slit diaphragms in the glomerulus of the kidney are too narrow to allow most solute from the blood to enter the nephron. As a result, large particles such as viral vectors generally cannot access tubule epithelial cells necessary to correct genetic disorders. In this study, mice are induced into a state of proteinuria and subsequently administered viral vectors intravenously. This group of mice had higher levels of transduced kidney epithelial cells than the control (non-proteinuria) group.

BTSP involves dendritic spikes that temporally regulate synaptic potentiation and depotentiation. However, the role of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synaptic distributions in the emergence of place specificity in CA1 PNs remains unclear, due to the lack of detailed synaptic reconstructions in vivo.

Computational modeling of biologically relevant E and I synaptic distributions shows that spatial tuning is preserved with co-tuned, spatially clustered E synapses, but disrupted when E distributions are randomized. Moreover, synapse clustering has a different contribution to spatial tuning in apical vs. basal domains.

However, neither animals nor plants contain ERGO biosynthetic pathways, which are limited to fungi, including and some species of bacteria, including Actinomyceota, Cyanobacteria, and Methylobacteria. Though the leading dietary sources of ERGO for humans are fungi in the form of mushrooms or fermented foods, biofortification of crops by promoting the production and uptake of ERGO from microbial sources in the soil has promise for enhancing nutritional quality and public health outcomes. Results. This study explores the of interaction between soil ERGO application and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in plant-symbiotic relationships to increase the ERGO content in the staple crop wheat (Triticum aestivum). We investigate how ERGO supplementation, both alone and in combination with AMF, influences the wheat root and soil microbiome in a greenhouse experiments. Our data shows that plants can take up ERGO in absence of AMF fungi. In addition, treatment with pure ERGO and ERGO in combination with AMF altered microbial diversity and community structure in both the rhizosphere and rhizoplane regions of wheat roots. Conclusions. Overall, our work reveals that plants can readily take up ERGO from soil, both with and without AMF presence, highlighting a broader role of ERGO in connecting soil health to human health, a connection that warrants further investigation.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Our group previously identified a subset of pro-inflammatory TAMs associated with poor prognosis in human melanoma. GM-CSF, a myeloid-priming cytokine, exhibits context-dependent effects on tumor growth and, despite its clinical use, its role in human melanoma remains undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that GM-CSF is significantly enriched in primary cutaneous melanoma samples from patients who subsequently developed metastasis, compared with non-metastasizing ones. By quantifying GM-CSF expression in TAMs and tumor cells (TCs), we found that high levels, in both TAMs and TCs, correlated with reduced disease-free and overall survival (p< 0.0001). Although GM-CSF receptor subunits were present in TCs and TAMs, their expression did not correlate with clinical outcomes. To explore the pro-metastatic role of GM-CSF, we performed in vitro assays and found that it activates non-canonical signaling pathways, such as STAT3 and PI3K/AKT, and promotes melanoma cell invasion. Consistently, its administration enhanced lung colonization by melanoma cells in a murine model, an effect reversed by CD116 receptor blockade. Furthermore, GM-CSF-primed macrophages secreted higher levels of inflammatory cytokines upon interaction with melanoma cells than those unprimed or primed with the counterpart cytokine M-CSF. Reciprocally, RNA-seq analyses revealed a broader transcriptional reprogramming in melanoma cells exposed to GM-CSF-primed macrophages, which displayed enhanced expression of inflammatory-response genes, suggesting a feedforward loop. Altogether, our findings highlight a potentially pro-tumorigenic GM-CSF-driven paracrine axis in patients with poor-prognosis melanoma, supporting therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting this signaling network.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Their roles include shaping the gene expression landscape during and after brain development by defining and maintaining levels of proteins that generate the distinct morphological and functional properties of neurons and other brain cell types. HT22, N2A, and SH-SY5Y are common immortalized neuronal cell lines that offer simple, less expensive, and time-saving options for in vitro modelling to evaluate miRNA functions. The extent to which these lines reflect primary neurons remains, however, unclear. Here, we benchmarked the miRNA profiles of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons against Argonaute-loaded miRNAs in the adult mouse hippocampus and miRNA data from the hippocampus of patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. We then compared the miRNA expression landscape in HT22, N2A and SH-SY5Y against mouse hippocampal primary cell cultures. We profiled over 700 miRNAs across the lines and detected 310 miRNAs in all four cell types. This included detection of neuron-enriched miRNAs such as miR-124 and miR-128, although the cell lines typically displayed lower levels of these than in primary neurons and reference adult hippocampal tissue. The miRNA profile in the HT22 cell line showed the highest correlation to the mouse primary neuronal cultures. Together, this study provides a dataset on basal miRNA expression across commonly used cell lines for neuroscience research and evidence for both conserved and distinct profiles that should be used to inform decisions on cell lines for modelling brain and miRNA research.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

We used mouse mating behavior to model how the brain orchestrates slow-timescale changes in motivation. Male mice become sexually satiated after successful matings, and their motivation to mate gradually recovers over a week. Using deep-brain fluorescence-lifetime imaging in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), we found that tonic dopamine transmission - which regulates mating drive - also declined after mating and re-emerged over a week. Two mechanisms regulated dopamine transmission. First, successful mating transiently reduced tonic firing of hypothalamic dopamine-releasing neurons, thereby inhibiting dopamine release and mating behavior. Second, mating reduced the ability of these neurons to produce and release dopamine, and this ability gradually returned over the week-long recovery time course. Therefore, fast and slow mechanisms of neuronal plasticity cooperate to control the early and late phases of motivational dynamics, respectively.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

STING is a protein related to the immune sensing of DNA and autophagy, and it has been proposed to be involved in PD neurodegeneration. To investigate this, we injected 10 g of murine pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) of a-syn (or monomeric and PBS as controls) into the striatum of wild-type (WT) and STINGgt/gt mice, which lack functional STING. We examined motor behavior and brain pathology at 1- and 6-months post-injection. STINGgt/gt mice showed more motor changes associated with PFF injection than WT mice. STINGgt/gt mice had a differential immune response to PFF with early and sustained increased microglia numbers and earlier macrophagic CD68 response, but milder changes in the expression of immune-relevant markers such as TLR2, TLR4, IL1b, and TREM2. However, the lack of STING did not induce changes in the extent of a-syn pathology nor the p62 accumulation seen in the model. Altogether, this resulted in a faster but similar degree of nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration after 6 months. Therefore, the data do not support a necessary role for STING in the a-syn induced nigral neuronal loss in the PFF-PD mouse model used here. However, the results suggest a functional relevance for STING in the brain response to the excess of amylogenic proteins such as a-syn that can contribute to symptomatic changes.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Quantitative analysis of Moore swab data is only possible if target uptake is well characterized, specifically the relationship between quantity of the target in the liquid sample matrix and the quantity of target sorbing to the Moore swab as a function of time. The mechanism of Moore swab absorption remains unclear and is important to understand toward using them more quantitatively. We conducted viral adsorption and desorption experiments using nonpathogenic SARS-CoV-2 surrogates: 6, MHV, and BCoV as well as heat-inactivated Zika virus (ZIKV). We fit empirical adsorption data from batch experiments to Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models. We observed the adsorption behavior of viral targets onto Moore swabs is best characterized by the Redlich-Peterson isotherm model. Moore swabs retained the highest viral RNA concentrations after exposure durations between 9-12 hours in the presence of target microbes during kinetic viral adsorption experiments.

Among these, exon 45 deletion is the most frequently reported single exon deletion in DMD patients worldwide. In this study, we generated a novel rat model with an exon 45 deletion using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The Dmd{Delta}45 rat recapitulate key clinical and molecular features of DMD, including progressive skeletal muscle degeneration, cardiac dysfunction, cognitive deficits, elevated circulating muscle damage biomarkers, impaired muscle function, and overall reduced lifespan. Transcriptomics analyses confirmed the deletion of exon 45 and revealed gene expression patterns consistent with dystrophin deficiency. In the skeletal muscle, RNA-seq profiles demonstrated a transition from early stress responses and regenerative activity at 6 months to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and metabolic dysfunction by 12 months. Similarly, the cardiac transcriptomic shifted from an early inflammatory and stress-responsive state to one characterized by fibrotic remodelling and metabolic impairment. Despite these pathological features, the Dmd{Delta}45 rats exhibited a milder phenotype than other DMD rat models. This attenuation may be attributed to spontaneous exon 44 skipping, which partially restores the reading frame and results in an age-dependent increase in revertant dystrophin-positive fibres. Further analysis indicated downregulation of spliceosome-related genes, suggesting a potential mechanism driving exon skipping in this model. In summary, the Dmd{Delta}45 rat represents a valuable model for investigating both the molecular determinants of phenotypic variability and the endogenous mechanisms of exon skipping. These findings offer important insights for the development of personalized exon-skipping therapies, particularly for DMD patients with exon 45 deletions.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

However, experimental screening of antibody-antigen interactions is labor-intensive and costly. Existing structure-based computational methods often face significant challenges in modeling the dynamic conformational flexibility that governs antibody-antigen interactions, which limits their ability to accurately identify binding. Therefore, there is an urgent need for accurate and efficient sequence-based prediction method to accelerate antibody discovery and reduce experimental burden. Results: We propose MultiSAAI, a sequence-informed framework that models antibody-antigen interactions by explicitly accounting for the distinct roles of antibody heavy and light chains in antigen binding. MultiSAAI integrates language model embeddings, physicochemical properties, geometric constraints, and residue substitutability to characterize antibody-antigen interactions across multiple scales, employing a multi-scale network architecture that simultaneously evaluates global residue-pair compatibility and local amino acid fitness at the binding interface. Furthermore, the incorporation of site-specific information and biologically grounded binding principles allows the model to more closely reflect the actual mechanisms of interactions. Benchmark results demonstrate that MultiSAAI achieves AUROC scores of 0.757 on the generic antibody-antigen interactions dataset and 0.946 on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset, outperforming existing methods such as A2binder and AbAgIntPre. Finally, large-scale preliminary antibody screening further validates the potential of MultiSAAI for high-throughput therapeutic antibody discovery.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

In particular, CGB genes are expressed in the majority of urothelial bladder cancers, where CGB7 is most frequently expressed and significantly associated with an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment, including decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration.

Although somatic mutations in ion channels within APA have been shown to activate Ca2+ signaling and drive aldosterone production, the pathophysiology of PA remains partially understood. Substance P (SP), encoded by the TAC1 gene, is a neuropeptide of the tachykinin family, known for its role in stimulating aldosterone production through activation of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) in the human adrenal cortex. The aim of our work was to investigate the presence of SP nerve fibers and the NK1 receptor in a large series of APA to assess the potential role of this neuropeptide in the pathophysiology of PA. We analyzed 56 APA tissues using molecular, immunohistochemical, and functional techniques to assess the expression of SP and NK1R and examine the action of SP on aldosterone secretion. SP-positive nerve fibers were detected in 90% of the APA tissues, appearing localized both within and around the adenomas, which also showed strong NK1R expression. Functional studies revealed that SP stimulated aldosterone secretion in 6 of 10 APA cultures. The NK1R antagonist aprepitant inhibited SP-induced aldosterone secretion in 3 of the 4 SP-responsive APA cultures on which the antagonist was tested. Additionally, in perifused APA explants, SP influenced aldosterone pulsatility, resulting in enhanced mineralocorticoid secretion. These findings suggest that the SP-NK1R signaling pathway may contribute to APA pathophysiology and represent a novel potential target for the pharmacological treatment of PA in a subset of patients.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

We investigated whether FGR lambs have altered cardiovascular responses to perinatal asphyxia compared to control lambs, and whether impairments in 1 and {beta}1 adrenergic receptor function underlie these responses. Methods: Single or twin-bearing ewes underwent sterile fetal surgery at 89 days gestation (dGA; term=148d) to induce FGR (single umbilical artery ligation) or sham surgery (Control). At 126dGA, lambs were delivered via caesarean section, instrumented and randomised to immediate ventilation (ControlVENT n=6; FGRVENT n=6), or asphyxia (ControlASPHYXIA n=12; FGRASPHYXIA n=11) induced by umbilical cord occlusion while withholding resuscitation until diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased to 10mmHg. Lambs were ventilated for 8 hours before baseline ex vivo cardiac function was assessed via Langendorff perfusion to measure left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), heart rate (HR) and coronary perfusion pressure (CPP). Ex vivo 1 and {beta}1 adrenergic responses were assessed via phenylephrine (10-5 to 10-2 mmol/L) and dobutamine (10-7 to 10-4) administration, respectively. Results: FGRASPHYXIA lambs had lower BP during asphyxia (p<0.05 vs ControlASPHYXIA) and took longer to reach a diastolic BP of 10mmHg (14.5 {+/-} 0.8 min vs. 19.2 {+/-} 1.3 min; p=0.005). FGRASPHYXIA lambs had lower BP in the first 5 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation (p<0.05) due to impaired vascular contractility, with reduced Tau, dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin (p<0.03 vs ControlASPHYXIA). Baseline LVDP, HR and CPP were similar between groups, however FGRASPHYXIA lambs had increased LVDP responses to phenylephrine and dobutamine (p<0.05 vs ControlASPHYXIA), without significant changes to HR or CPP. Conclusion: FGR lambs have altered physiological responses to perinatal asphyxia due to impaired vascular contractility and dysregulated cardiac 1 and {beta}1 adrenergic receptor function, which may increase susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction in the neonatal period.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Temporal phenomic classification model accurately distinguished between drought-treated and control plants, achieving high accuracy (R2 0.97) even when exclusively using predictors only from the early phase after drought induction. Canopy temperature depression at the early stage and RGB-derived plant size estimates at the late stage were identified as key classification features. Temporal phenomic prediction model of harvest-related traits achieved particularly high mean R2 values for total biomass dry weight (0.97) and total spike weight (0.93), with RGB plant size estimators emerging as important predictors. Prediction accuracy for these traits remained high (R2 0.84) when using only predictors from the first half of the experiment. Models trained on pooled drought and control data outperformed single-treatment models and retained high accuracy when applied across treatments.

After further dropping 76 studies with no exam scores data, 134 of these studies contained data on student performance on identical or equivalent exams. We found that on average, active learnings effect size on exam scores was 0.519 {+/-} 0.049, meaning that when students are in active learning classes, they perform roughly half a standard deviation higher on an identical exam. Funnel plots and sensitivity analyses indicated that these results were not due to sampling bias. Active learning had a positive impact on student outcomes regardless of class size, course level, or STEM discipline, though there was heterogeneity in the effects. All of these results are very similar when compared to earlier meta-analyses, however increased resolution in the studies analyzed here revealed two novel results. First, student performance was significantly better in courses that employed high-intensity active learning, defined as students being on task at least two-thirds of class time, versus lower-intensities. Additionally, there was significant heterogeneity in efficacy across different types of active learning employed. These results suggest that most, if not all types of active learning are effective, and that when innovating in their classes, instructors should continually work to increase active learning intensity. We urge caution in interpreting the results on active learning types, however, and propose a preliminary framework for making more-sophisticated and reliable analyses of variation in course design. Finally, the evidence presented here for active learnings impact on student outcomes creates a strong foundation for faculty professional development and administration.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

S.; Adcock, A.; Gritsenko, V.", "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Upper limb motor deficits are common after stroke and often persist despite rehabilitation. Clinical assessments focus on movement quality but fail to quantify underlying neuromuscular impairments, especially in individuals with mild deficits. We aimed to characterize stroke-related changes in muscle recruitment during reaching by separating tonic (gravity-compensating) and phasic (intersegmental dynamics-related) components of electromyographic (EMG) activity and assessing their relationship to motor impairment. Methods: We recorded surface EMG from 12 upper limb muscles during goal-directed reaching in 8 participants with unilateral ischemic stroke and 9 age-matched controls. Using principal component analysis, we extracted tonic and phasic components of muscle activity and compared their amplitude, directional tuning, and coactivation patterns across groups. Score differences between stroke and control groups were analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models, regression analyses, and correlation with time since stroke and previously published muscle torque-based performance indices. Results: Individuals with stroke exhibited disrupted muscle recruitment even with mild motor deficits. Proximal muscles were over-recruited in directions that normally require less muscle activation, indicating abnormal directional tuning. Phasic activation of distal muscles was significantly reduced and declined further with time post-stroke (R2 = 0.52, p = 0.002), while tonic overactivation of proximal muscles was present in all participants with stroke. Coactivation between multiple muscles was altered, with right-hemisphere stroke reducing tonic coactivation in contralateral arms and left-hemisphere stroke increasing it. Abnormal phasic coactivation between proximal and distal muscles was present and correlated with impaired limb propulsion (R2 = 0.67, p = 0.013). Tonic and phasic recruitment deficits were often correlated, suggesting shared disruption of corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways. Conclusions: Stroke causes distinct yet interacting impairments in tonic and phasic muscle recruitment that underlie individual motor deficits. These findings support the need for neuromechanically informed assessment tools that target specific motor pathways to guide individualized rehabilitation strategies.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

P.; Krishnan, A.; Ravi, J.", "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains the second leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide, killing over one million people annually. Rising antibiotic resistance has created an urgent need for host-directed therapeutics (HDTs) -- preferably by repurposing existing approved drugs -- that modulate host immune responses rather than directly targeting the pathogen. Repurposed therapeutics have been successfully identified for cancer and COVID-19 by finding drugs that reverse disease gene expression patterns (an approach called 'connectivity scoring'), but this approach remains largely unexplored for bacterial infections like TB. The application of transcriptome-based methods to TB faces significant challenges, including dataset heterogeneity across transcriptomics platforms and biological conditions, uncertainty about optimal scoring methods, and lack of systematic approaches to identify robust disease signatures. Here, we developed an integrative computational workflow combining multiple connectivity scoring methods with consensus disease signature construction and used it to systematically identify FDA-approved drugs as promising TB host-directed therapeutics. Our framework integrates six complementary connectivity methods and constructs weighted consensus signatures from 21 TB gene expression datasets spanning microarray and RNA-seq platforms, diverse cell types, and infection conditions. Our approach prioritized 140 high-confidence drug candidates that consistently reverse TB-associated gene expression changes, successfully recovering known HDTs, including statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin) and vitamin D receptor agonists (calcitriol). We identified promising novel candidates such as niclosamide and tamoxifen, both recently validated in experimental TB models, and revealed enrichment for therapeutically relevant mechanisms, e.g., cholesterol metabolism inhibition and immune modulation pathways. Network analysis of disease-drug interactions identified 10 key bridging genes (including MYD88, RELA, and CXCR2) that represent potential novel druggable targets for TB host-directed therapy. This work establishes transcriptome-based connectivity mapping as a viable approach for systematic HDT discovery in bacterial infections and provides a robust computational framework applicable to other infectious diseases. Our findings offer immediate opportunities for experimental validation of prioritized drug candidates and mechanistic investigation of identified druggable targets in TB pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that the LIM domain containing region (LCR) of the planar cell polarity protein Prickle2 (Pk2) associated with stressed actin filaments in Xenopus mesoderm alongside known stress-sensitive LIM domains. By contrast, the full-length Pk2 did not exhibit similar recruitment along actin filaments. Structure function analysis revealed that both the structured PET domain and unstructured C-terminal region of Pk2 suppress recruitment of Pk2s LCR to stressed actin and promote recruitment to Pk2-rich nodes. Finally, we show that two human patient-derived variants associated with epilepsy result in a loss of Pk2-LCR recruitment to actin filaments. These data provide new insights into the regulation of stress-sensitive LIM domains and may inform our understanding of planar cell polarity.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

With this method, numerous novel protein-coding loci have been discovered by searching for short fragments of hypothetical longer peptides and polypeptides. Apart from the validation of translation from mRNA transcripts, MS proteomics has been instrumental for the detection of peptides encoded by non-mRNA transcripts. A special application field of MS proteomics is studies on programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), where the detection of chimeric peptides produced from two different reading frames is vital. Each novel chimeric peptide is thought to originate from a certain genetic locus. However, due to the short length of MS peptides, there is a possibility that MS-supported chimeric peptides are produced by additional (alternative) loci via PRF. This scenario evaded due attention because the contribution of non-canonical peptides and proteins to the functional diversity of proteomes is still thought to be minor. Recent studies have challenged this paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, our group was the first to include alternative chimeric sources into the analysis pipeline. This resulted in a much higher certainty about loci responsible for the production of unusual peptides. This certainty is crucial for the functional characterization of such loci. At the same time, our study revealed enormous diversity of potential alternative sources for a subset of MS-supported non-canonical peptides. Here, we present a highly flexible program that predicts alternative chimeric and non-chimeric sources of peptides detected by MS proteomics.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

However, challenges remain in accurately modeling truncated sequences, irregular secondary structures, and interchain-induced conformational changes. The release of AlphaFold3 (AF3) during CASP16, and its effective integration by many groups, demonstrated its superiority over AlphaFold2 (AF2), particularly in confidence estimation and model selection. Additional improvements in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and construct design, i.e., selecting the optimal fragment of the full sequence for modeling, also contributed to enhanced prediction accuracy. The top three groups--all from the Yang lab--consistently outperformed others across CASP16 monomer targets, reflecting their robust modeling pipelines and successful adoption of AF3. CASP16 also introduced three new challenges: Phase 0, in which stoichiometry was withheld; Phase 2, which supplied ~8,000 MassiveFold models per target to test model selection strategies; and Model 6, which limited predictors to using MSAs provided by the organizers. While we evaluated group performance in these additional challenges, the insights gained were limited due to low participation and design flaws in the experiments. We suggest improvements for the organization of these challenges and encourage broader engagement from the prediction community. The progress in monomer modeling from CASP15 to CASP16 was very subtle, but more groups in CASP16 were able to outperform ColabFold, reflecting increased expertise in optimizing AF2 and the growing adoption of AF3. We anticipate that the recent release of the AF3 source code will stimulate future progress through user-driven optimization and innovations in model architecture.

We hypothesized that systemic exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) during late pregnancy would increase maternal inflammation, alter circulating EV characteristics, and disrupt placental stress responses. Pregnant rats were exposed to CIH (n=8) or normoxia (n=9) during gestational days 15-20 (term 22-23 days). On GD20, ccf-mtDNA and EV-associated mtDNA (EV-mtDNA) were quantified with qRT-qPCR, while maternal circulating cytokines were quantified using a MILLIPLEX(R) cytokine array. Systemic oxidative stress was measured by plasma advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). Placental stress responses were evaluated by examining the balance between proinflammatory and antioxidant gene expression and the activation of proteins involved in apoptotic and autophagic processes. CIH exposure increased placental weights (p=0.015) and reduced placental efficiency (p=0.0006) without affecting fetal biometrics (p>0.05). Absolute ccf-mtDNA and EV-mtDNA content were unchanged (p>0.05), but EV concentrations were reduced (p=0.011) in response to CIH, suggesting an increase in EV-mtDNA per EV.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that captures brain activity at high temporal resolution. However, its spatial resolution is insufficient to accurately localize neural activation, and thus cannot capture the interactive nature of human brain activity. To resolve this issue, various MEG source estimation models have been proposed. In particular, models incorporating prior information from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which offers superior spatial resolution, have improved source estimation accuracy. However, these models typically ignore the similarity of activity across different brain areas, and still fall short in tracking dynamic brain activity pattern at a sufficient spatial scale. In this study, we developed a block-structured model that integrates information about functional areas and the inter-areal relationships of the human brain into MEG source estimation based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We evaluated our model performance using simulation data with sequential activation across multiple brain areas. Results showed that our model outperformed conventional approaches in source estimation accuracy, suggesting that incorporating the functional areal information and inter-areal relationships may enhance MEG source estimation, enabling human neuroimaging at high spatio-temporal resolution.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Typically, visual working memory research investigates how storing affects subsequent action. In doing so, however, the importance of how the action affects prior storing remains underappreciated. Therefore, we here question how the required precision for an action to succeed, affects how relevant visual information is encoded, maintained and finally acted on. To this end, we had participant memorize 1, 2 or 4 colors for delayed continuous report. Crucially, we manipulated how (im)precise the report was allowed to still be marked correct. Behavioral results showed that for actions with higher required precision, reports became more precise, but only when one or two colors were memorized. Also, reports became slower with higher required precision, regardless of the number of colors. By leveraging pupillometry, we further showed that with higher required precision, 1) colors were encoded deeper (since pupils constricted more during presentation), and 2) more effort was exerted to maintain the colors (since pupils dilated more during retention). Moreover, we found that participants kept exerting more effort to be precise (with increasing precision requirements), even when additional effort did not result in better performance anymore. Our findings demonstrate that humans consider their intended actions when encoding and maintaining information in visual working memory.

We replicate quantitative differences previously seen between presumptive null PTC variants based on their position in the coding sequence. We show with reciprocal congenic strains that large phenotype differences between two PTC variants with the same predicted stop and reinitiation codons is due to the specific allele rather than different strain backgrounds, with no evidence for induced exon skipping. Differences in RNA structure, however, could influence translation rate across the affected exon. Using a reporter assay, we find differences in translational reinitiation between two deletion variants that corelate with predicted RNA structure rather than distance from the canonical initiation codon.

Castration resistant PCa initially responds to androgen signaling inhibitors such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, but the cells become resistant to these drugs as well overtime. We used long-term cell cultures to create testosterone-dependent, testosterone-independent (CT), bicalutamide-resistant (BR), enzalutamide-resistant (ER), and sequential resistant BR-ER VCaP cell lines to investigate transcriptomic and proteomic changes during the development of drug resistance. Phenotypical changes were evaluated based on cellular morphology and sensitivity to docetaxel. We observed marked changes in transcriptome during the development of drug resistance and differences between ER and sequential BRER. Androgen response and fatty acid metabolism were upregulated in both ER and BRER. MYC target hallmarks were positively enriched only in BRER. Negative regulation of cell death was upregulated in ER while in BRER cell cycle related pathways were upregulated. Direct comparison of ER and BRER revealed androgen signaling signature being higher in ER than in BRER. BRER was more resistant to docetaxel than ER. Clinical significance of our results was confirmed using Finnish patient data and public patient data. In castration resistant patients' response to enzalutamide treatment were decreased in patients first treated with bicalutamide comparing patients treated only with enzalutamide. In conclusion, we showed that transcriptomic and phenotypic changes occurring during formation of drug resistances and docetaxel sensitivity depend on the sequence of treatments.

We conducted transcriptomic and lipidomic profiling to examine how chia leaves respond to short-term (3 h) and prolonged (27 h) heat stress, followed by recovery under ambient conditions. Heat stress induced differential expression in over 20% of transcripts in chia leaves, with distinct patterns involving Ca2+ signalling, heat shock factors, and other biological pathways contributing to cellular homeostasis. Gene expression and lipid profiles in chia leaves responded dynamically to both short-term (3 h) and prolonged (27 h) heat stress (38 C/20 C).

It is presently unknown whether this trawling signal applies to the seafloor alone, or may also extend to microbiota of marine holobionts inhabiting it, such as flatfishes. Here, three flatfish species (Buglossidium luteum, Limanda limanda and Pleuronectes platessa) were sampled across the southeastern North Sea. We characterized the intestinal microbiota using 16S rDNA metabarcoding of 162 individuals, and disentangled how intestinal microbial composition and diversity are jointly shaped by various host traits (species, sex, age, weight, and condition factor) and environmental factors (sediment type and trawling intensity). Intestinal diversity varied among species and changed with age, weight and sediment type. Community composition was dependent on species, age, condition factor and sediment type. In addition, we found that trawling intensity explained shifts in intestinal microbial community composition, suggesting that the known impacts of bottom trawling on the benthic environment may cascade to intestinal microbiota of flatfish.

We allowed perfumed queens to establish colonies and examined worker attraction and egg laying following daily exposure to these odors without the queen, both with and without brood as context. Workers preferred the odor they grew up with and exposure to learned odors without the queen influenced worker egg laying only in the presence of brood, surprisingly resulting in increased egg laying. Our study demonstrates that workers can modify their behavior after learning an odor associated with their queen or nest. These learned odors function as context-dependent releaser pheromones, influencing worker attraction and egg-laying behavior.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

While the majority of paralogous TFs are dispersed across different chromosomes, some remain clustered raising the question of whether genomic proximity confers any evolutionary advantage for TF clusters. To address this, we investigated a ~1 Mbp locus containing two ETS family paralogs, Ets1 and Fli1. Using a sub-diffraction sequential imaging technique called Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA), we traced the 3D organization of this region in single alleles of T cells from genetically engineered mice with targeted deletions of key regulatory elements. In wild-type T cells, the predominant chromatin conformation spatially links Ets1 to its proximal super-enhancer, segregating Ets1 from Fli1. This topology correlates with high Ets1 and low Fli1 expression. Deletion of the Ets1 super-enhancer abolishes this configuration, triggering locus-wide architectural rewiring that increases Ets1-Fli1 promoter-promoter interactions and subsequently the co-expression of two genes within individual cells. Remarkably, this compensatory interaction bypasses insulated chromatin domains, sustaining Ets1 levels necessary for T cell development despite enhancer loss. Our results reveal that genomic clustering of TF paralogs enables dynamic architectural plasticity: while a super-enhancer fine-tunes paralog expression balance in wild-type contexts, its deletion unmasks latent promoter-driven coordination, suggesting that proximity safeguards functional redundancy and transcriptional resilience critical for cellular fitness.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

This study examines the dynamic nature of leadership and its impact on perceptuomotor learning in a dyadic coordination task. Paired participants (dyads) controlled targets using joysticks to produce a novel coordination pattern, which was learned using visual feedback without direct communication over multiple sessions. Results showed that leadership was an emergent property of the system, dynamically shaped by the interplay between individual and system-level stability. At the system level, leadership role transitions modulated the dyad's learning, characterized by distinct learning models. At the individual level, leaders maintained overall stability but exhibited occasional bursts of instability to assert control and reinforce coordination. These findings highlight the role of leader-follower dynamics in learning and performance, showing that leadership is both a limiting factor and a facilitator for coordination.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Limitations of these approaches include sensitivity to repetitive k-mers and bias against longer sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel overlap graph construction workflow based on three steps: feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search.

In honeybees (Apis mellifera), infection with the common gut parasite Nosema ceranae causes metabolic disruption and increased mortality. Ethanol is a naturally occurring bioactive compound found in nectar, and honeybees exhibit high tolerance and resilience to chronic exposure. However, whether bees actively use ethanol during infection remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether N. ceranae-infected honeybees alter their ethanol consumption. In a feeding experiment, infected and uninfected bees were given a choice between plain sucrose solution and ethanol-spiked food (0.5% or 1% ethanol). We measured food consumption, survival, and spore load. Although overall food intake did not differ between groups, infected bees consumed a significantly higher proportion of ethanol-spiked food. Survival analysis showed that a diet containing 1% ethanol caused higher mortality than a diet containing 0.5% ethanol; however, among bees on a 1% ethanol diet, this negative effect was less pronounced in infected individuals than in controls. Spore load did not differ between treatments. These results suggest that N. ceranae infection induces a shift in feeding behavior towards increased ethanol intake, which may benefit infected bees by reducing mortality. This may reflect a self-medication response, although alternative explanations - such as parasite-induced manipulation or ethanol-induced changes in host physiology and immunity - remain possible. Further research into ethanol's effects on Nosema spores is needed. Nonetheless, our findings provide insights into honeybee interactions with bioactive compounds and suggest that ethanol may be a behaviorally relevant dietary substance.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Thus, we studied 94,571 viral genomes from January 2020 to October 2024 using a novel representation of codon usage, which recoded gene sequences to labels reflecting human codon usage. Our analysis reveals that the genes coding for structural proteins tend to exhibit a less optimal adaptation to the human codon usage, whereas open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1ab encoding non-structural proteins show an opposite trend. The sequences for the accessory proteins demonstrated a variable tendency to change the codon preferences. The evolution of the more optimal codon usage in ORF1a and ORF1ab sequences can be associated with a higher speed and efficiency of translation of the coded polyproteins. Following their cleavage, the products play important roles in viral replication and transcription. Thus, the adaptation of their codons can increase the virus proliferation. In contrast, alterations in codon usage within structural protein-coding sequences may be associated with changes in their less accurate translation and folding during synthesis, which can provide an advantage in evading the host immune response. The results show that codon usage adaptations to the human host differ based on the gene type and function, reflecting a balance between their conflicting evolutionary pressures. Our findings on variations in codon usage among coronavirus genes provide valuable insights that can aid in developing new strategies for optimization of codons in vaccine mRNA and DNA for emerging strains.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Although there has been prior evidence that the grass host can influence alkaloid production levels, these have never been precisely quantified. Here, we report on testing alkaloid production and relative fungal biomass on >1000 genetically distinct tall fescue plants. We find that these two traits are weakly correlated, and that both show evidence of moderate to high influence by the host genome. Genome-wide association find only a single marginally significant hit, however, implying that any genetic control by the host is spread among a large number of genes. These results indicate that the host plant exerts moderate influence on these endophytic traits, that the two are largely independent of each other, and that the hosts influence is likely due to a large number of genes of small effect.

However, the role of a lipase in PVM disruption remains unknown. Here, we characterized the role of UIS28 (upregulated in infective sporozoite gene 28) in Plasmodium berghei. Bioinformatic studies indicated that UIS28 is a class 3 lipase containing a fungal lipase-like domain. We found that UIS28 localizes to the PVM in infected hepatocytes. To understand the role of UIS28 in PVM disruption, we validated its lipase activity and found that it breaks down lipids into glycerol. Parasites lacking UIS28 develop normally in the blood and mosquito stages and mature fully into hepatic merozoites but show a defect in egress from host hepatocytes. We quantified the PVM rupture and reported that mutant parasites exhibit delayed egress due to impaired PVM disruption. Together, our results demonstrate that UIS28 is a lipase involved in the disruption of the PVM and the successful egress of hepatic merozoites.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

BpfA is classified as a member of the 4-phenol oxidizing (4PO) subfamily and contains a conserved FAD-binding domain (Asp152 and His393) as well as a Tyr-Tyr-Arg triad (Tyr93, Tyr474, Arg475).

In addition, BpfA exhibits catalytic activity towards 4-alkylphenols, such as vanillyl alcohol (VA), 4-n-propylguaiacol (4PG), and 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol (4MOP). BpfA homologs are widely distributed in the environment, particularly in soil. Bioinformatics-based taxonomic profiling revealed that BpfA homologs are widely distributed in metagenomes from cultivated land and forests, mainly belonging to Pseudomonadota and Actinomycetota.

Diagnosis and treatment of aspergillosis often occur during stages of infection when A. fumigatus has formed dense networks of hyphae within the lung. These dense hyphal networks are multicellular, encased in a layer of extracellular matrix, and have reduced susceptibility to contemporary antifungal drugs, characteristics which are defining features of a microbial biofilm. A mode of growth similar to these dense hyphal networks observed in vivo can be recapitulated in vitro using a static, submerged biofilm culture model. The mechanisms underlying filamentous fungal cell physiology at different stages of biofilm development remain to be defined. Here, we utilized an RNA sequencing approach to evaluate changes in transcript levels during A. fumigatus biofilm development. These analyses revealed an increase in transcripts associated with fermentation and a concomitant decrease in oxidative phosphorylation related transcripts. Further investigation revealed that ethanol and butanediol fermentation is important for mature biofilm biomass maintenance. Correspondingly, a gene (silG), a predicted transcription factor, was observed to also be required for mature biofilm biomass maintenance.

Monomers of conventional adhesive systems may result in inhomogeneous polymer networks and the release of residual monomers that cause cytotoxicity. In this study, we develop a one-step multi-functional polymeric resin system by incorporating trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and bis[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] phosphate (BMEP) to enhance both mechanical properties and adhesion to dentin. Molecular dynamics simulations identified an optimal triacylate:trithiol ratio of 2.5:1, which was consistent with rheological and mechanical tests that yielded a storage modulus of ~30 MPa with or without BMEP. Shear bond tests demonstrated that the addition of BMEP significantly improved dentin adhesion, achieving a shear bond strength of 10.8 MPa, comparable to the commercial primer Clearfil SE Bond. Nanoindentation modulus mapping characterized the hybrid layer and mechanical gradient of the adhesive resin system.

While tumorigenicity is defined by neural stemness and its regulatory networks, how immunogenicity of cancer cells is determined and how tumorigenicity is related with immunogenicity remained unknown. In the present study, we show that genes conferring tumorigenicity and genes conferring immunogenicity are inversely correlated with differentiation status of cells. Cancer cells can be induced to differentiate into different types of cells either by lineage specific differentiation factors, e.g., muscle differentiation factor MYOD1 or adipocyte differentiation factor PPARG, or by blocking cell-intrinsic oncofactors, e.g., SETDB1. Induced differentiation reprograms both cellular properties and transcriptomes of cancer cells, leading to suppression of genes conferring tumorigenicity and upregulation of genes conferring immunogenicity, and ultimately, leading to loss of neural stemness, suppression of tumorigenicity and enhancement of immunogenicity in cancer cells after differentiation. Vice versa, dedifferentiation leads to the opposite effect. The results identified the cellular mechanism that tumorigenicity and immunogenicity of cancer cells are inversely connected and determined by differentiation status. Such a mechanism, together with our previous studies, reinforces that cancer cell properties should be understood by understanding neural stemness and the principle of embryonic cell/tissue differentiation, and novel cancer therapies can be developed by employing differentiation effect of cancer cells induced by differentiation factors. As a proof of concept test, we showed that muscle differentiation factor MYOD1 suppresses tumorigenesis in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

However, little is known about differences in sleep architecture by APOE genotype, and whether they vary by age and sex. Methods This cross-sectional study examined the association between APOE genotype and sleep architecture, using in-home polysomnography (Sleep Heart Health Study, N=3,107). APOE genotype included: APOE4 heterozygotes, APOE4 homozygotes, APOE2 carriers, and APOE3 homozygotes (reference). Sleep architecture was quantified using the percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep (%REM), N1 (N1%), N2 (%N2), N3 (%N3), and arousal index. Linear regression was employed, adjusting for age, sex, marital status, race, education, and parent cohort. Interactions with age and sex-stratified analyses examined variations by age and sex, respectively. Results The median age was 67 years, 27.4% carried at least one APOE4 allele, and 52.9% were females. Without age by APOE genotype interaction, %REM, %N1, %N2, %N3, and arousal index were comparable across APOE genotypes in the full sample, males, and females. When an age by APOE genotype interaction was introduced, APOE4 homozygotes showed fewer arousals with each year of age (beta=-0.33 arousals, p=0.04), leading to significantly less arousals at age >=70 (marginal difference=-2.98, p=0.04). Conclusions Compared with APOE3 homozygotes, APOE4 homozygotes showed comparable proportions of REM, N1, N2, and N3, but exhibited fewer arousals in old age. APOE4 homozygotes may have an elevated arousal threshold.

NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a multifunctional tumor suppressing protein that regulates Ras, cAMP, and dopamine signaling. NF1 predisposes patients to a wide range of symptoms, including peripheral nerve tumors, brain tumors, and cognitive dysfunction. Despite considerable work using animal models to investigate the role of neurofibromin in behavior, translating research into treatment for NF1-associated cognitive dysfunction has not yet been successful. Here, we identify Cxcr4 chemokine receptor signaling as a regulator of habituation learning and modulator of cAMP-PKA signaling in nf1 mutant larval zebrafish. Combining a small-molecule drug screen and RNAseq analysis, we show that cxcr4b expression is increased in nf1 mutants and that pharmacological inhibition of Cxcr4 with AMD3100 (Plerixafor) improves habituation learning in nf1 mutants. We further demonstrate that Plerixafor treatment activates cAMP-PKA pathway signaling but has limited effects on Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway signaling in the nf1 mutant brain.

In contrast, much less is known about the sensitivity of Fam150b-Alk expression and signaling upon noxious challenges. In this regard, acute stress is of particular interest because augmentor , released from afferents of the food intake circuit of the arcuate hypothalamus in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVN), could link stress-induced changes in food consumption. Nevertheless, conflicting data exist on whether Fam150b mRNA is expressed in the PVN. Here, we combined single-cell RNA-seq and multiplexed in situ hybridization to demonstrate that both Fam150b and Alk are expressed in the PVN of adult mice, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-containing neurons. As such, a dichotomy of CRH neurons is present through their mutually exclusive expression of either Fam150b or Scgn (secretagogin). Fam150b and Alk were not co-expressed. When inducing inflammation-associated stress, Fam150b but not Alk mRNA expression increased in a mifepristone-sensitive manner, implying regulation by peripheral glucocorticoid feedback.

K.; Dahlgren, C.; Forsman, H.; Sundqvist, M.", "abstract": "Signaling by formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), the prototype G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in neutrophil leukocytes, is initiated by an activation of a G protein containing a Galphai subunit. FPR1 activation results in an increase in the cytosolic concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i), and an activation of the superoxide anion producing NADPH oxidase. Receptor downstream signals generated by the danger molecule ATP recognized by the purinergic receptor P2Y2 are transduced by a G protein containing a Galphaq subunit. The neutrophil response induced by ATP also includes a transient rise in [Ca2+]i, but the downstream signals do not activate the NADPH oxidase. ATP can, however, activate this enzyme system through a receptor transactivation mechanism dependent not only on the ATP receptor but also on the free fatty acid receptor FFA2R, provided that this receptor is allosterically modulated. This occurs through a novel mechanism whereby FFA2R is activated from the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane by Galphaq transduced signals generated by the ATP receptor. Furthermore, in neutrophils with a disrupted actin cytoskeleton, ATP (as well as platelet activating factor; recognized by the Galphaq-coupled PAFR) becomes a potent NADPH oxidase activating agonist. At high concentrations of the actin cytoskeleton disrupting drug latrunculin A the activation was only partly reduced by Galphaq inhibition. More importantly, this response was also partly inhibited by pertussis toxin. The effects on the ATP-induced NADPH oxidase activity, of the Galphaq inhibitor and pertussis toxin were more and less pronounced, respectively, when the concentration of latrunculin A was reduced. Taken together, we show that in primary human neutrophils the actin cytoskeleton is part of the regulatory machinery that determines the activation of NADPH oxidase activation and the G protein recruitment profile downstream of activated of Galphaq-coupled GPCRs.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

This study investigated interactions between a Saccharibacterium (Nanosynbacter lyticus), its host-bacteria (Schaalia odontolytica), and oral epithelial cells. The host-bacteria induced proinflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells, while Saccharibacteria were immune silent. Remarkably, Saccharibacteria dampened cytokine responses to host-bacteria during coinfection. This effect was driven by Saccharibacteria-induced clustering of TLR2 receptors, a process likely facilitated by type IV pili, ultimately leading to reduced TLR2-mediated cytokine signalling. High resolution imaging showed that Saccharibacteria were endocytosed by oral epithelial cells, and colocalized with endosome markers, eventually trafficking to lysosomes. Moreover, a subset of the Saccharibacteria survive endocytosis long-term, and retains their capability to reinfect host-bacteria, highlighting a mechanism for persistence in the oral microbiome and a vital role in mammalian immune system modulation.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

However, C. auris pathogenesis is not well understood, which is exacerbated by limitations and discrepancies in existing animal infection models. Further, the effects of C. auris growth phase on virulence have not been examined, despite growth phase being linked to virulence in many bacterial species. To address this question, and to develop an immunocompetent murine model of infection, we directly compared log and stationary phase C. auris systemic infection in immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice at high and low doses of infection. Systemic infection with high dose log-phase C. auris results in rapid mortality between 2 hours and 1 day post infection, whereas stationary phase C. auris results in significantly extended survival. However, at low doses of infection, there was no difference in mortality kinetics between log and stationary phase cells. We observed that C. auris initially colonizes multiple organs but is rapidly cleared from the lungs and spleen, while kidney fungal burdens remain stable. Decreased fibrinogen levels and blood clotting in the lungs of mice infected with high dose log-phase C. auris suggest that blood clotting may drive rapid mortality, potentially associated with increased {beta}-glucan exposure and mannan abundance observed in log phase C. auris. These results will inform the development of a more standardized animal model of systemic C. auris infection, which can be used to reveal key aspects of C. auris pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Due to global warming, its abundance is increasing at high latitudes.  While the species harbors diverse virulence factors, its precise disease mechanisms remain unclear. Comparative genomics between clinical and environmental isolates can help identify key virulence genes, but the limited availability of genomes from environmental isolates has hindered progress. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of 82 V. vulnificus isolates from water, sediment, and seagrass along the Baltic Sea coast and complemented with published genomes from 208 clinical and 117 globally distributed isolates for comparative analysis. Phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed four major lineages, with Baltic Sea strains confined to lineage L2 and L4, while clinical and environmental strains were distributed across all lineages. This suggests that the phylogenetic structure of V. vulnificus reflects adaptation to environmental conditions rather than pathogenicity. Using the PhyloBOTL pipeline developed here, we identified 128 orthologs significantly enriched in clinical isolates, grouped into 36 co-localization clusters based on proximity in the genomes. These included genes linked to virulence, such as those for capsular polysaccharide synthesis and biofilm formation, as well as previously unrecognized candidates, including chaperone-usher pilus biosynthesis, spermidine synthesis, Type VI secretion effectors, and an RTX toxin-like protein. Several of the clinically enriched gene clusters have been independently lost in three V. vulnificus clades, suggesting convergent evolution and a distinct ecological niche shared by these claded. Finally, we used the clinically enriched genes to design PCR primers for detecting and monitoring pathogenic V. vulnificus strains, providing a valuable tool for surveillance and public health efforts.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

HCMV encodes four putative G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): US27, US28, UL33, and UL78. While the roles of most of these receptors have been investigated, a definitive role for UL78 in HCMV infection has yet to be elucidated. Utilizing an in vitro CD34+ HPC model, we demonstrate that a recombinant virus lacking UL78 protein expression fails to efficiently reactivate from latent infection. Furthermore, we show using a Lumit-based assay that UL78 preferentially couples to the Gi family of G proteins and that a recombinant HCMV containing mutations in the UL78 G protein-coupling DRL motif also fails to reactivate from latent infection. Together our findings indicate that Gi coupling is important for UL78 function during reactivation in latently infected CD34+ HPCs, however the protein is not required to establish or maintain latency. To better understand the role of UL78, we conducted proximity-dependent labeling analyses in HCMV-UL78-TurboID infected fibroblasts and CD34+ HPCs undergoing reactivation from latency. Congruent with our coupling data, we found Gi was the only heterotrimeric G protein in proximity to UL78. Pathway analysis of the UL78 interactome revealed proteins associated with membrane trafficking, signaling, and the nuclear pore complex as enriched in both cell types. In addition, the UL78 interactome contained viral proteins with nuclear localization including viral transcription and DNA replication machinery. Nuclear localization of UL78 was validated using cell fractionation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and proximity-dependent labelling of isolated nuclei. Together, our results provide novel insights into the localization and function of UL78, previously unknown to contribute to reactivation from latent infection.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

We employed rarefaction methods to estimate effort-adjusted species richness due to unequal sampling effort across classes, and analysed community composition using Jaccard dissimilarity and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). Natural habitats, primarily evergreen and moist deciduous forests, supported the most diverse and functionally specialised bird communities. In contrast, agricultural and urban areas were dominated by generalist guilds such as omnivores and granivores, indicating ecological simplification. Interestingly, tea plantations exhibited high rarefied richness despite lower overall diversity, likely due to uneven sampling patterns.

These outbreaks involve shifts in population dynamics and phenotypic traits, influencing beetle responses to olfactory cues from stressed host trees. Aims: The study examines the size-dependent behavioral and antennal responses of female I. typographus to two host selection-deciding volatiles with contrasting ecological roles: 1,8-cineole, which inhibits attraction to unsuitable trees, and (+)-isopinocamphone, a pheromone synergist. Size-linked morphological and olfactory adaptations may influence females' ability to select suitable host trees for reproduction. Methods: In field trap experiments conducted in 2019 and 2022, the body size of I. typographus females caught in response to different doses of (+)-isopinocamphone or 1,8-cineole in combination with pheromone was compared. Female Ips typographus were sorted based on body length, the size of the antennal club was measured, and size-dependent antennal responses to these volatiles were analyzed using electroantennography. Results: Larger females were more attracted to (+)-isopinocamphone in combination with pheromone in the field, showed stronger antennal detection, and had proportionally larger antennal clubs than smaller females. In contrast, smaller females were less repelled by 1,8-cineole added to pheromone but, in contradiction, antennally detected it more strongly than larger females despite having smaller antennal clubs. Conclusion: The total body length significantly influences semiochemical detection in I. typographus females. (+)-isopinocamphone was detected more effectively by larger females, implying an advantage in the selection of suitable host trees. In contrast, the discrepancy between behavioral and antennal responses to 1,8-cineole in smaller females suggests the involvement of not only peripheral detection but also central nervous processing of olfactory signals driving behavior. This adaptation may enable smaller females to reduce competition with large ones by selecting less suitable trees.

In the liver, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites and their labeling from both glutamine and lactate localized periportally. Energy-stress metabolites including adenosine monophosphate (AMP) also localized periportally, consistent with high periportal energy demand. In intestine, the TCA intermediates malate (tip) and citrate (crypt) showed opposite spatial patterns, which aligned with higher glutamine catabolism in tips and lactate oxidation in crypts based on isotope tracing. Finally, we mapped the fate of the obesogenic dietary sugar fructose. In the intestine, oral fructose was catabolized faster in the villus bottom than the tips. In the liver, fructose-derived carbon accumulated pericentrally as fructose-1-phosphate and triggered pericentral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion.

Although SOD1 has been extensively studied, especially regarding its role in ALS, relatively little is known about how aging and mutations affect SOD1 PTMs. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of oxidative stress induced by chronological aging on PTMs of human SOD1: wild-type (WT) and A5V SOD1, a severe ALS-related mutant. To do this, both hSOD1 forms were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking the SOD1 gene, and then purified from extracts of stressed and non-stressed cells. PTMs were analyzed using mass spectrometry, observing the modification of WT and mutant human SOD1 in both conditions. We observed changes in the levels of damage, including oxidation, formylation, and carboxylation, such as oxidized tryptophan 33, associated with prion-like propagation of SOD1 misfolding. Increased levels of this PTM appeared in WT SOD1 after aging and in A5V SOD1. Acetylation and succinylation were also found on lysines.

To address this hypothesis, we access to the collection of protein sequences and gene expression from NSULIN and paralogues in EGB, NCBI and EBI. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA software, conserved protein motifs were compared using algorithm MUSCLE and presenting it graphically using CLC Genomics Workbench, transcripts and gene expression from transcriptome and microarray data from different experiments of insulin and paralogues were extracted and graphicaly presented using CIRCOS. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that humans, like most of all mammals, have INSULIN and INSULIN-INSULIN GROWTH FACTOR 2 with the exception of murinae among mammals that share Insulin 1 and Insulin 2. Both Insulin 1 and 2 can regulate glucose since both proteins are highly similar and with a redundant function, as confirmed by in vivo experiments showing that both knockout Insulin 1 or 2 are normoglycemic. Human INSULIN- INSULIN GROWTH FACTOR 2 lacks motif 3 of the INSULIN signature, and part of the predicted protein structure does not present any known domain, making the prediction of a possible function for this gene inconclusive. Extrapancreatic expression of insulin has been observed in diabetic mice with contradictory effects, but available gene expression data in repository data banks also suggests that extrapancreatic expression of insulin occurs in human, mouse and zebrafish under basal condition.

While significant progress has been made in elucidating mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance, the role of cell-to-cell communication in modulating treatment response remains largely unexplored. Here, we combined microfluidic technology with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to directly compare the transcriptional responses of cells in communication versus those in isolation. Upon dox treatment, we observed robust activation of the p53 pathway in communicating cells, whereas this response was markedly impaired in isolated cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of caveolar-mediated endocytosis mimics the loss of p53 activation, further implicating this pathway in the communication-dependent regulation of chemotherapy response. This finding uncovers a previously unrecognized and essential role for paracrine signalling in mediating p53-dependent responses to chemotherapy. Our study highlights the critical importance of cell-to-cell communication in shaping therapeutic outcomes and opens new avenues for understanding and potentially overcoming chemotherapy resistance.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

E.; Diogo, R.; Ane, J.-M.; Wallace, J.

Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) already supplies nitrogen to legume crops and several avenues of research are underway to extend it to non-legume crops. In maize (Zea mays), aerial roots have been shown to contribute to BNF in some varieties, and both having many aerial roots and large aerial roots contributes to the fixation trait. However, much of the genetics controlling aerial root number and size is still unknown. Here we validate and quantify BNF in maize varieties from Southern Mexico under controlled conditions and evaluate a population of double haploids derived from the elite inbred PHZ51 crossed with these varieties. We find that most aerial root traits (root number, nodes with roots, root size) are reasonably heritable (h2 0.5-0.75) and generally uncorrelated with each other. QTL mapping identifies 5 QTL each affecting nodes with aerial roots and aerial root number per node; in both cases all but 1 QTL show an increase from the landrace allele. We also identify 11 QTL for aerial root diameter, with most positive QTL coming from PHZ51. Between the two populations, only a few QTL overlap, indicating a presumably high diversity of genes affecting aerial root morphology in landrace populations. Combining the best QTL into elite material may provide a path toward meaningful levels of BNF for maize, and additional work is needed to determine how viable this approach will be in field settings.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

The virus exhibits a broad species tropism, infecting cells derived from pigs, humans and mice, highlighting its potential for cross-species transmission. Due to drawbacks associated with the use of young piglets, there is a need for an appropriate small animal model to study SADS-CoV biology. Here we established a mouse infection model based on a murinized mutant of the virus, mSADS-CoV, in which the ectodomain of the viral spike protein was replaced by that of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). This chimeric virus, generated through targeted RNA recombination, replicated efficiently in murine cell cultures and exhibited an age-dependent infection in neonatal mice that was lethal in 2-day-old BALB/c mice affecting various organs, notably the intestine. We validated our infection model by successfully verifying the efficacy of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir (RDV).

Beyond their classic TE-silencing roles piRNAs functions range from sex determination in moths, to degradation of maternal mRNAs during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, thus highlighting the need for more sampling across the tree of life, particularly in underrepresented speciose rich subphyla such as the crustaceans were to date only two representatives have been analysed. In this study we sequenced and analysed putative piRNAs in the amphipod Parhyale hawaiensis, throughout a time-course of embryogenesis. Initially, during early embryogenesis piRNAs-mapping reads were abundant, maternally loaded piRNAs and showed the hallmark signatures of piRNA processing suggesting active targeting of TEs. Interestingly, this initial high content was followed by a dramatic loss of piRNA-mapping transcripts and signatures during mid-embryogenesis shortly after germ cell specification. This was confirmed by in-situ hybridization of key mRNAs coding for piRNA pathway proteins which revealed their expression becomes restricted specifically to the germ cells by early germband formation, providing an explanation for the observed reduction in piRNA abundance at later stages, and suggesting that piRNAs are absent in Parhyale post embryonic somatic cells.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

We hypothesize that rarely accounted dinucleotide substitutions within a single codon, which allow for a broader range of amino acid substitutions than single nucleotide changes, are a significant aspect of diversifying selection. From the analysis of 43 studies, comprising 11,730 clinical isolates with resistance to rifampicin, 11 different dinucleotide substitutions were identified in 54 codons of resistance-determining regions of the rpoB gene. The prevalence of such substitutions is approaching 4%. Although rifampicin was introduced in treatment regimens in the 1970s, dinucleotide substitutions were also found in resistance determinants for newer drugs, linezolid and bedaquiline, rplC, and atpE, despite the significantly smaller number of resistant clinical isolates reported. Conducting a genome-wide analysis of dinucleotide mutations in the dataset of 9,941 genomes studied by the CRYpTIC Consortium, in addition to resistance determinants, we discovered three genes with a significantly elevated number of dinucleotide substitutions, which are presumably related to virulence and host adaptation. Two substitutions, cyp138 P114F and L191A are supposed to occur early in the evolutionary history of lineage 2 and are now under strong selection for reverse substitutions. Two amino acid substitutions in the third gene, rv2024c N508T and C514L, could also be obtained by single nucleotide changes and therefore are supposedly being selected based on frequency of codon usage.

In cultured fibroblasts, these mutations result in a dearth of transcript and severe loss of protein, thereby establishing their likely pathogenicity. The underlying reduction in gene expression is due to the activation of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway as a consequence of exon-skipping rather than intron retention, leading to aberrant transcripts. We further demonstrate that LNPK is subject to genetic compensation, as both cells from the affected individual and her mother exhibit a significant increase in transcript compared to a control cell line when treated with an inhibitor of NMD.

Over three years, we placed a decoy of a common nest predator, the eastern rat snake (Pantherophis alleghaniensis), on top of nest boxes and measured female behavior. Each season, we also presented a second stimulus of varying threat level, including an eastern chipmunk decoy (Tamias striatus), a taxidermied Coopers hawk (Accipiter cooperii), and a novel object of unknown threat. We measured repeatability between each pair of threats and compared the population-level response to the snake across years. Nest defense was significantly repeatable between the snake and chipmunk, which presented similar risks. It was also repeatable between the snake and novel object despite the population-level response to the object being significantly weaker. In contrast, nest defense was not repeatable between the snake and the hawk, which posed a significant threat to adult survival that may have disrupted the consistency of the female response. Finally, the average, population-level response to the snake did not detectably differ among years, indicating stability in this behavior despite high turnover in breeding adults. These results suggest the presence of personality in nest defense, but more research is needed to evaluate the effect of high-risk predators on the repeatability of this behavior.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

More strikingly, while such tools are operated under the assumption that running them with broadly the same parameters will yield consistent results, this study demonstrates how parameters unrelated to clustering thresholds, such as parameter decimal precision (0.8 vs. 0.80), output selection, and even CPU and memory allocation, can alter gene family assignments. Additionally, sequence clustering and pangenome tools often fail to report biologically meaningful or representative sequences for gene families, further complicating downstream analyses.

Unraveling these underlying biomolecular interactions is a key challenge that hinders a profound understanding of disease mechanisms. Although current models can accurately predict quantitative binding affinity, their application in pathogenic research is limited by difficulties in defining trend types, particularly extreme \"disrupting\" cases, along with poor generalizability beyond single-point mutations (SNP) and insufficient biological interpretability. Here, we present TAPPI, an interpretable large language model-driven deep learning framework, to perform Trends Assessment of Protein-Protein Interaction. It categorizes PPI variations' trends into four types: disrupting, decreasing, no effect, and increasing, enabling fine-grained functional assessments and bridging genetic mutation and disease mechanisms. The framework generalizes effectively across both single-point and multi-point mutations and captures complex trend outcomes relevant to diverse disease landscapes. In benchmark evaluations, TAPPI achieved the state-of-the-art prediction performance and demonstrated biological relevance through interpretable results. In external datasets from Autism Spectrum Disorder, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and Epileptic Encephalopathies, given the premise that TAPPI's predicted results align with pathogenic patterns, these results reveal how genetic mutations indirectly perturb disease-associated pathways and supporting our perspective of \"crucial disrupting\" and \"bridging mutations-disease\".

Current sequence-to-label methods typically employ the two-stage pipeline: (i) encoding mutant sequences using neural networks (e.g., transformers), followed by (ii) the {Delta}{Delta}G regression from the latent representations. Although these methods have demonstrated promising performance, their dependence on specialized neural network encoders significantly increases the complexity. Additionally, the requirement to individually compute latent representations for each mutant site negatively impacts computational efficiency and poses the risk of overfitting. This work proposes the Venus-MAXWELL framework, which reformulates mutation {Delta}{Delta}G prediction as a sequence-to-landscape task. In Venus-MAXWELL, mutations of a protein and their corresponding {Delta}{Delta}G values are organized into a landscape matrix, allowing our framework to learn the {Delta}{Delta}G landscape of a protein with a single forward and backward pass during training. Besides, to facilitate future works, we also curated a large-scale {Delta}{Delta}G dataset with strict controls on data leakage and redundancy to ensure robust evaluation. Venus-MAXWELL is compatible with multiple protein language models and enables these models for accurate and efficient {Delta}{Delta}G prediction. For example, when integrated with the ESM-IF, Venus-MAXWELL achieves higher accuracy than ThermoMPNN with 10x faster in inference speed (despite having 50x more parameters than ThermoMPNN).

Traditional penalized regression methods like lasso and ridge regression apply uniform shrinkage without considering underlying biological relationships between genes, often resulting in unstable feature selection and reduced interpretability. Network-regularized methods that incorporate prior biological knowledge have emerged as promising alternatives, yet systematic comparisons of different network penalties in accelerated failure time (AFT) models remain limited. Methods: We developed and evaluated Weibull AFT models incorporating two network-regularized approaches: inverse-degree penalties that apply stronger shrinkage to highly connected hub genes, and graph Laplacian penalties that promote smoothness across connected nodes. We conducted comprehensive simulations across varying signal strengths, censoring rates (30%, 50%, 80%), and noise levels, followed by real-data applications on three cancer datasets (TCGA-KIRC, TCGA-COAD, and IDH-wildtype gliomas) using both STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and co-expression networks. Performance was assessed using estimation and prediction mean squared error, false positive/negative rates, concordance index, and pathway enrichment analysis. Results: The inverse-degree penalty demonstrated consistently more conservative feature selection behavior, achieving substantially lower false positive rates while maintaining competitive predictive performance compared to Laplacian penalties. In simulation studies, the inverse-degree method achieved false positive rates of 0.126 versus 0.299 for Laplacian penalties under strong signal conditions. Real-data applications showed comparable predictive accuracy (C-index: 0.61-0.73) between methods across cancer types. Both methods successfully identified biologically relevant pathways including mTORC1 regulation and fatty acid metabolism in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and IL-17/chemokine signaling in IDH-wildtype gliomas. Notably, in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) analysis, the inverse-degree method identified ten coherent pathways centered on inflammation, cell-cycle regulation, and proteasome function, while the Laplacian approach introduced potentially spurious neurotransmitter-release associations, demonstrating the inverse-degree penalty's superior biological interpretability. Conclusions: Network-regularized AFT models with inverse-degree penalties offer a valuable tool for biomarker discovery in high-dimensional genomic survival analysis, providing conservative feature selection and superior biological interpretability while maintaining competitive predictive performance. The accompanying DegreeAFT R package makes these methods accessible to the broader research community, facilitating adoption in precision oncology applications where identifying reliable prognostic signatures is critical for treatment decision-making.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

J.; Xu, M.", "abstract": "The accurate prediction of chromosomal instability from the morphology of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enables real-time detection of CTCs with high metastatic potential in the context of liquid biopsy diagnostics. However, it presents a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of single-cell digital pathology data. Here, we introduce the application of Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size biomedical contexts. QCML enables the simulation of cognition-like learning for the identification of biologically meaningful prediction of chromosomal instability from CTC morphology, offering a novel tool for CTC classification in liquid biopsy.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}

Although various optical methods have been developed to investigate deep brain dynamics, they are limited by technical constraints, invasiveness, suboptimal spatial resolution, and/or a restricted field of view. To overcome these limitations, we developed an implantable, optically optimized microprism interface with a refractive index matched to that of brain tissue and water, enabling minimally-invasive, wide-field two-photon imaging method with enhanced brightness and sub-micron resolution in deep prefrontal areas.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": ""}
