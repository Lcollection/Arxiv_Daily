During low-arousal states such as slow wave sleep, synchronous low-frequency rhythms dominate activity across widespread cortical regions. Although inhibitory neurons are increasingly recognized as key players of cortical state, the in vivo circuit mechanisms coordinating synchronized activity across local and distant neocortical networks remain poorly understood. Here, we show that somatostatin and chondrolectin co-expressing cells (Sst-Chodl), a sparse and genetically distinct class of neocortical GABAergic inhibitory neurons, are selectively active during low-arousal states and largely silent during periods of high arousal. In contrast to most neocortical inhibitory neurons, Sst-Chodl cells, despite being extremely sparse, exert widespread influence across the neocortex via long-range axons that simultaneously target multiple regions. Selective activation of Sst-Chodl cells is sufficient to promote multi-region cortical synchronization characteristic of low-arousal states and to induce sleep. Together, these findings show that long-range Sst-Chodl inhibitory neurons not only track behavioral state but can actively promote sleep-like cortical activity and sleep behavior, highlighting an important contribution of cortical circuits to sleep regulation alongside established subcortical mechanisms.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

This study investigates how the CNS adapts to long-term alterations in the musculoskeletal system using a tendon transfer model in non-human primates. We surgically relocated finger flexor and extensor muscles to examine how the CNS adapts its strategy for finger movement control by measuring muscle activities during grasping tasks. Two months post-surgery, the monkeys demonstrated significant recovery of grasping function despite the initial disruption. Our findings suggest a two-phase CNS adaptation process: an initial phase enabling function with the transferred muscles, followed by a later phase abandoning this enabled function and restoring a control strategy that, while potentially less conflicted than the maladaptive state, resembled the original pattern, possibly representing a 'good enough' solution. These results highlight a multi-phase CNS adaptation process with distinct time constants in response to sudden bodily changes, offering potential insights into understanding and treating movement disorders.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

Recent studies demonstrate that the olfactory bulb (OB) encodes such temporal features present in natural odor stimuli. However, whether this temporal information is encoded in the piriform cortex (PCx) remains unknown. Hence, we developed a biophysically relevant PCx network model and simulated it using previously recorded in vivo activities of mitral and tufted cells in response to 2Hz and 20Hz odor frequencies for three odor mixtures. Analysing the single-cell activity across trials revealed that individual pyramidal neurons (PYRs) were ineffective at distinguishing between 2Hz vs. 20Hz. However, the trial-averaged activity of the PYRs population could discriminate between the two frequencies significantly. Moreover, using log-likelihood scores we further discovered that odor frequency discrimination happened through a highly distributed mechanism among the PYRs. 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN) models trained and tested on PYRs activities achieved discrimination accuracies up to 95%. Using virtual synaptic knockout models, we found that eliminating either feedback or feedforward inhibition onto PYRs improved the decoding accuracy across all odor conditions. Conversely, eliminating recurrent excitation among PYRs or simultaneously eliminating recurrent inhibition among both interneuron types degraded the accuracy. Removing recurrent connections within individual interneuron populations had minimal effects on the performance. Overall, our PCx model demonstrates that it can discriminate between 2Hz and 20Hz odor stimuli, with a bidirectional capability of performance modulation by specific circuit motifs. These findings predict that the piriform cortex encodes and processes temporal features of odor stimuli.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

Precision-weighting, is an important facet of predictive processing theories and has been extensively studied with mismatch responses using electroencephalography. Harmonicity is a feature of sound that is important for auditory perception and previous research has shown that it modulates the brain's mismatch responses. Since inharmonic sound spectra contain more information (have higher information entropy), inharmonicity has been suggested to be involved in precision weighting. In this study we explored this issue by parametrically modulating the level of inharmonicity applied to synthetic sounds and recording mismatch responses (MMN and P3a) from healthy volunteers (N = 37). Our results show that a sigmoid function models the relationship between inharmonicity and MMN amplitude better than any linear or polynomial function. Furthermore, P3a amplitude has an inverted-U relationship with inharmonicity and peaks at inharmonicity levels just below the threshold for pitch discrimination. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that inharmonicity impairs F0 extraction above a certain threshold and does not serve as an index of precision in the auditory system.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

For combinations of Esyn and gsyn, corresponding to an excitatory synapse, a supervised machine learning method for classification distinguishes the motifs perfectly with a score of 1.0 when using binned counts of postsynaptic spikes as the input. Strongly inhibitory combinations of these parameters result in no postsynaptic response in both types of microcircuit motifs; hence, the classifier does not improve upon a random assignment with a score of 0.5. In other domains of the parameter space spanned by Esyn and gsyn, corresponding to diminished excitation/inhibition, the classifier fails (0.5 < score < 1), indicating the challenge in identifying the nature of the synapse inferred exclusively from postsynaptic spikes.

The acoustic pathway uses a long-short term memory (LSTM) decoder and a high-fidelity generative adversarial network (HiFi-GAN) to reconstruct spectrotemporal features. The linguistic pathway employs a transformer adaptor and text-to-speech (TTS) generator for word tokens. These two pathways merge via voice cloning to combine both acoustic and linguistic validity. Using only 20 minutes of electrocorticography (ECoG) data per subject, our approach achieves highly intelligible synthesized speech (mean opinion score = 4.0/5.0, word error rate = 18.9%).

During non-REM sleep, plasticity increased in DLPFC, indexed by elevated E/I balance measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy and polysomnography, in correlation with performance gains.

Recipients of inactivated vaccines readily develop Omicron-specific antibodies through repeated breakthrough infections, whereas mRNA-vaccinated individuals exhibit severe ancestral-strain imprinting that suppresses de novo Omicron-specific responses. These differences could result in distinct antibody landscapes, leading to regional epidemiological divergence and necessitating region-specific vaccine update strategies. Importantly, conventional wild-type mouse models fail to recapitulate strong human SARS-CoV-2 imprinting, which significantly hinders imprinting-related mechanistic investigation and vaccine update evaluation. Here, we surprisingly found that V(D)J-humanized mice could faithfully recapitulate human severe SARS-CoV-2 immune imprinting phenotypes. Comprehensive antibody repertoire and epitope mapping of 583 monoclonal antibodies from these models revealed that the abundance of pre-existing IGHV3-53/66-encoded SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses determines imprinting severity following Omicron exposure through antibody-mediated masking of Omicron-specific epitopes. Both passive transfer of IGHV3-53/66 antibodies and knock-in of the human IGHV3-53 gene were sufficient to induce severe SARS-CoV-2 imprinting in wild-type mice. Concordantly, head-to-head comparison also showed that mRNA vaccine recipients retained higher IGHV3-53/66 antibody abundance and thus stronger imprinting than inactivated vaccine recipients. Consequently, compared to NB.1.8.1, XFG exhibits greater immune evasion in mRNA-vaccinated individuals but not in inactivated vaccine recipients. This explains the regional predominance of XFG in mRNA-vaccinated populations, while NB.1.8.1 prevails in inactivated vaccine-dominated countries. Together, these findings demonstrate that the V(D)J germline repertoire--even a single germline-encoded antibody response--can profoundly shape humoral imprinting severity. Accordingly, we constructed a human IGHV3-53 knock-in mouse model that can accurately recapitulate human SARS-CoV-2 antibody landscape, providing a valuable tool for guiding future COVID-19 vaccine updates.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

Kombucha, an ancient fermented tea, relies on a biofilm known as a symbiotic community of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) and a starter culture to ferment sweet tea, producing various metabolites including gluconic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and carbon dioxide. While fermented foods have been historically associated with potential health benefits, direct evidence comparing the prevalence of human pathogens in fermented versus non-fermented beverages has been lacking. To address this, we conducted a citizen science experiment at Arizona State University, introducing swabs from people's palms into both kombucha and a sweet tea control. Over 30 days, we monitored the bacterial and fungal composition using 16S and ITS rRNA sequencing. Our findings reveal that kombucha maintained a relatively stable microbial profile and physical appearance, with a typical SCOBY biofilm developing. In stark contrast, the sweet tea experienced a dramatic change in microbial composition and was visibly compromised by rapidly growing microorganisms. Importantly, this suggests that the complex microbial ecosystem of kombucha can limit the growth of foreign microbes introduced from human hands. Given that human pathogens were absent from the kombucha while present in the tea samples, our results indicate that the antimicrobial properties of fermentation byproducts and the physical barrier of the SCOBY may contribute to this resilience.

Using a computational model constrained by these data, we identify inhibitory axonal propagation failures as a mechanistic link between myelin loss and altered circuit function. Partial remyelination normalizes cortical network-level metrics and reach consistency but leaves smooth movement impaired, revealing a selective vulnerability in inhibitory circuits.

In contrast, functional mapping of large-scale brain networks within subcortical regions remains an emerging and challenging field, hindered by a low signal-to-noise ratio in subcortical functional MRI data and an inability to distinguish networks with substantial spatiotemporal overlap. In this study, we fractionated and identified fifteen spatially overlapped and temporally correlated subnetworks, which can be categorized into four large-scale brain networks. The subcortical functional connectivity patterns of these subnetworks exhibited distinct, yet overlapping, spatial configurations, with widely connected hub nodes identified in the caudate, putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus. These subnetworks are highly reproducible across healthy human brains and provide normative functional atlases, which we release here as a resource for the academic community.

Most of the visually responsive neurons were more strongly modulated by task-relevant than task-irrelevant visual motion. Encoding in labeled PPC-M1 neurons was similar to encoding in unlabeled neurons, with one major exception: unlike the task-relevant visual enrichment in unlabeled PPC neurons, task-relevant and task-irrelevant visual motion were encoded at similarly weak levels in PPC-M1 neurons. This argues that although PPC encodes a mix of visual, movement and other information, the PPC-M1 pathway is dominated by movement information and does not propagate PPC's learned enrichment of task-relevant visual signals.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

However, the nature of the bacterial signal and the host cells and molecules involved in receiving and transducing this signal remained unknown. We identify here uracil as the bacterial metabolite responsible for this priming and demonstrate that the effect is mediated by Duox-dependent produc6on of reactive oxygen species in the larval gut. We show that specific expression of TrpA1 isoforms in a Gr66a-expressing neuron of the larval terminal organ is required for the adult response.

J.; Kovner, R.; Pattabiraman, K.; Sestan, N.", "abstract": "The frontal lobe comprises the prefrontal association cortex (PFC), which supports complex cognition and goal-directed behavior, and the motor cortex (MC), which executes movement. A hallmark of primate brain evolution is PFC expansion accompanied by a posterior displacement of the MC. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling has emerged as a key regulator of PFC specification and expansion. However, the mechanisms that spatially confine RA signaling within the developing PFC, and the downstream RA-responsive gene networks, remain poorly understood. Here we defined an RA-associated gene regulatory network (RA-GRN) in the developing human PFC and identified MEIS2, which encodes a transcription factor linked to intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as its key hub of this network. Conditional deletion of Meis2 in postmitotic cortical excitatory neurons in mice results in a partial respecification of prospective prefrontal association territories toward motor-like molecular and connectional features, highlighting a critical role of postmitotic neurons in establishing and maintaining cortical areal identities. Concomitant with Meis2 loss, the population of excitatory neurons expressing the RA-synthesizing enzyme ALDH1A3, and consequently RA signaling itself, is markedly reduced in the developing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These findings revealed a conserved autoregulatory loop: RA -> MEIS2 -> ALDH1A3 -> RA that reinforces a PFC-enriched RA gradient and organizes the MC-PFC axis. Together, our findings reveal a postmitotic mechanism by which specific features of neuronal identity reinforce RA signaling to define key features of prefrontal and motor cortical territories, linking a classic morphogen to transcriptional identity, neural circuit formation and function, and potentially to psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

M.; khadir, A.; Dai, W.; Federer, F.; Angelucci, A.", "abstract": "Understanding the role of the different types of inhibitory interneurons in cortical computations is central to elucidating how the neocortex processes sensory information. The emergence of orientation tuning in primate primary visual cortex (V1) is a canonical model for studying how cortical sensory circuits and inhibitory interneurons compute relevant stimulus features. The selective feedforward convergence of non-orientation-selective thalamic afferents establishes initial orientation tuning in the granular V1 input layer. As signals propagate through the cortical microcircuit, orientation tuning sharpens in extra-granular layers, yet the underlying mechanisms and the contribution of specific inhibitory neuron subtypes within V1 remain unresolved. To study the role of the largest cortical inhibitory neuron subclass, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons, in this V1 computation, we combined laminar extracellular recordings with bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of PV+ cells in marmoset V1. Our results reveal a striking laminar specificity: in granular layers, PV+ cells implement divisive/ multiplicative linear gain control, whereas in extra-granular layers they exert tuned nonlinear suppression that enhances orientation tuning. Computational modeling suggests that PV+ neurons can control gain by changing a neuron's spiking threshold, and orientation tuning by changing a neuron's input noise, which regulates the neuron's input-output function. Our findings reconcile divergent results from previous rodent studies and establish a framework for understanding layer-dependent inhibitory computations in the primate cortex.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

Emotion expressions from the non-dominant modality (vocal expressions in the face networks, and vice versa) could also be decoded in all areas except the occipital face areas. A shared neural code for facial and vocal emotions is implemented in the temporal voice areas (TVA), the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and the precentral gyrus (PCG). The simultaneous presentation of congruent facial and vocal expressions elicited distinct activity patterns across most regions, highlighting that multisensory inputs reshape brain responses relative to unisensory stimulation across the entire face and voice brain network.

Shared and distinct properties have been proposed for somatodendritic and axonal release, but the mechanisms of somatodendritic release remain unclear. We here used mouse genetics, electrophysiology, and imaging to define roles of the synaptic vesicle priming protein Munc13 in somatodendritic release in comparison to axonal secretion. Munc13 ablation in dopamine neurons decreased evoked but not spontaneous somatodendritic dopamine transmission measured as D2 receptor-mediated currents. Imaging with a fluorescent dopamine sensor confirmed this finding and established comparable importance for Munc13 in somatodendritic and axonal secretion. Pharmacological experiments revealed that release from adrenergic terminals contributes to D2 receptor-mediated currents, and their relative contribution was enhanced after Munc13 knockout. Altogether, these data establish important roles for Munc13 in evoked somatodendritic release. These roles are similar to Munc13 functions in axonal dopamine release and at fast synapses. Spontaneous midbrain dopamine release does not necessitate Munc13 in dopamine neurons and may rely on a release pathway that is independent of the prototypical release machinery employed at synapses.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

On the neural level, efficient emotion regulation has been linked to functional communication between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the amygdala. Gaining voluntary control over this pathway may present an effective strategy for potentiating emotion regulation. Objective: Against this background, we developed a novel connectivity-based real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) training that enables individuals to gain volitional control over the DLPFC-amygdala pathway during exposure to threatening stimuli. Methods: The study employed a pre-registered, randomized, sham-controlled design with the experimental group (n = 22) receiving real-time NF information on connectivity between the right DLPFC and the amygdala during threat exposure and the sham control group (n = 23) receiving connectivity NF from a circuit not related to emotion regulation. The ability to maintain regulatory control in the absence of feedback was assessed after four NF runs. Primary outcomes included functional connectivity of the target pathway, as well as anxiety scores. Results: The results demonstrate that successful acquisition of self-regulation of the rDLPFC-amygdala top-down regulatory circuit in the experimental NF group facilitated attenuation of anxiety. Conclusion: In summary, our findings suggest that real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) allows to volitionally enhance rDLPFC-amygdala connectivity, and in turn reduces negative emotional states, rendering the training a promising neurotechnology intervention for mental disorders.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

As PTHS therapeutics advance toward clinical trials, identifying the optimal timing for treatment is crucial. Our previous research demonstrated that restoring TCF4 during embryonic or neonatal stages, corresponding to prenatal or neonatal periods in humans, improved phenotypes in a PTHS mouse model (Kim et al., 2022). However, PTHS diagnosis generally occurs much later, when infants fail to reach developmental milestones and undergo genetic testing. This raises an essential question: can genetic therapeutics initiated at more clinically relevant time points retain effectiveness? Here, we examined whether reinstating TCF4 in juvenile PTHS model mice could reverse behavioral phenotypes, simulating a gene therapy. Our findings indicate that this delayed intervention largely fails to correct most phenotypes, except for a measure of cognitive function. These results reveal phenotype-specific plasticity and underscore a narrow, early critical window for effective treatment in PTHS. Our study also identifies the hippocampus as a potential target for PTHS therapeutics and suggests that while some cognitive functions may still retain therapeutic plasticity, reversing most core PTHS symptoms may require intervention during the very early postnatal, or potentially prenatal periods, in humans.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

We show that retinoic acid (RA), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and growth differentiation factor (GDF) 11 direct dI identity, while GDF11 and extended time in culture promotes posterior spinal identities. Together, these protocols generate the full complement of dorsal subtypes along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the spinal cord. To benchmark in vitro-derived dIs, we constructed a single-cell RNA-Seq atlas of the human embryonic spinal cord and used it to show that hESC-derived dIs closely match their endogenous counterparts.

Psychoneuroimmunology models suggest altered immune and reward systems may jointly underlie its development. When dopamine availability (rather than function) is considered, immune activation may be understood as a moderator amplifying how lower dopamine levels translate into motivational deficits. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 55 youth with current depression (Mage=21.4 years; Female=75%). Plasma was assayed for relative quantification of 92 immune proteins, followed by dimensionality reduction via principal component (PC) analysis, forming five PC scores. Dopamine availability was indexed by basal ganglia tissue iron, quantified by MRI R2', a measure detectable in youth. Anhedonia was assessed using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), thought to capture overall anhedonia, and Positive Valence Systems Scale (PVSS), which provides overall, anticipatory, and consummatory anhedonia scores. PC1 scores-whose loadings indicated broadly distributed immune protein elevations consistent with general immune activation-moderated the relationship between basal ganglia dopamine availability and anhedonia: At higher PC1 levels, lower dopamine availability was linked to greater overall anhedonia (as measured by SHAPS) and anticipatory anhedonia, but not to consummatory anhedonia. Lower PC2 scores were associated with greater PVSS overall and consummatory anhedonia. Analyses examining individual basal ganglia regions suggest potential differences in dopaminergic-immune interactions across these regions, with effects most consistently observed in the putamen. Findings highlight nuanced neuroimmune pathways underlying anhedonia components in youth and support inflammation-based models of depression emphasizing dopaminergic-immune interplay.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms linking ELA to increased threat responses remain unclear. We identified a stress-sensitive medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-basolateral amygdala pathway that co-expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and glutamate. We find that ELA strengthens this pathway and increases threat avoidance behavior during adolescence. Inhibiting this pathway rescues ELA-induced elevations in adolescent avoidance, selectively in males. Reducing mPFC CRH expression earlier in development in typically-reared mice mimics ELA phenotypes in males.

To complement these findings, we examined sex differences in mouse hippocampal Cdk5 mRNA and protein following short and long restraint stress with or without concomitant social isolation stress. While short restraint stress was sufficient to promote anxiety-like in both male and female mice, it did not alter Cdk5. Rather, hippocampal Cdk5 mRNA increased only after a longer restraint stress duration followed by social isolation, and only in male mice. Hippocampal Cdk5 protein also shifted from the cytosolic to the nuclear compartment only in male hippocampus. Surprisingly, repeated restraint stress promoted exploratory behavior in both group-housed and socially isolated male and female mice. Social isolation alone increased Cdk5 protein in females only. Finally, under all conditions, female mice were less immobile and more exploratory than male mice.

Non-neuronal cell types including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and vascular cells also exhibited region-specific translational changes in neurotransmitter transport, lipid synthesis, myelination, and stress response pathways, some of which co-varied with regional neuron state.

In the current study, we examined how frontotemporal connectivity changes in the repeated phrases.

We performed paired longitudinal diet and microbiome analysis during CRC treatment with oral fluoropyrimidines (NCT04054908) and validated key associations using cell culture assays. Diet quality significantly decreased during chemotherapy. Carbohydrate and refined grain intake increased, accompanied by decreased consumption of fats, nuts and seeds, and fat-soluble micronutrients. Multiple individual dietary components were strongly linked to the gut microbiome. Decreases in theobromine intake correlated with decreases in overall microbial diversity and more gastrointestinal toxicities. Diet shifts partly explained changes in bacterial abundance during chemotherapy, including more severe depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in patients with decreased vitamin K1 intake. Changes in diet were correlated with multiple bacterial gene families involved in micronutrient metabolism and drug sensitivity. Increased copper intake was linked to decreased Fusobacterium nucleatum in patients and inhibited F. nucleatum in cell assays.

During commensal growth, C. albicans cells typically enjoy phosphate repletion and a neutral redox environment. Transitioning to invade host tissues, they simultaneously experience phosphate deprivation and intense extrinsic oxidative stress. Here, we employ solid-state NMR to render details of cell wall remodeling in response to oxidative stress, in its dependence on phosphate. Phosphate deprived cells remodel the rigid wall core and reduce hydration and polymer mobility in the absence of oxidative stress. During hydrogen peroxide exposure, highly mobile outer polysaccharides are primary interactors. In wildtype cells, some of these polymers are recruited into the rigid core, reinforcing the wall scaffold, whereas phosphate transport mutants fail to undergo this remodeling.

While many factors likely underlie these issues, one that has been underexplored is the idea that interactions between plants and microbes can vary across both different host genetics and different environments, and that specific combinations of host and environment can result in very different microbial outcomes. Results: To quantify how a plant microbiome can change across host genotype and environment and to determine the relative importance of these factors, we sampled maize stalks from 20 specific hybrid varieties grown at 15 locations in the United States. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we find that the stalk microbiome is highly variable, with a handful of bacterial taxa conserved at broader taxonomic levels (Phylum, Class) and almost none at finer levels (Genus, Species). Local environment and gene-by-environment interactions both had consistently large and significant effects on the microbial community (measured by alpha- and beta-diversity summary statistics, individual taxa, and inferred functional capacity), whereas host genotype had little to no consistent effect across environments. We also identified specific soil factors (pH and potassium) as the most significant environmental drivers of the community, even though these communities were living inside the stalks. Conclusions: Taken together, our results indicate that while host genetics can significantly affect the stalk microbial community, these effects are almost entirely predicated on interactions with the environment. These results imply that reliable deployment of microbes for crop production will require significant investment in trials across many locations and genetic backgrounds, either to estimate the GxE effects directly or to screen for microbes whose effects are less dependent on these two factors.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

G.; Sun, X.", "abstract": "The upper respiratory epithelium protects the airway from microbial exposure, environmental irritants, and viral pathogens such as influenza A virus (IAV). Situated at the airway-gastrointestinal junction, the larynx must integrate this barrier function with fine neuromuscular control under constant immune stimulation. Clinical syndromes such as post-viral vagal neuropathy-marked by chronic cough, throat clearing, dysphonia, and vocal fatigue-highlight critical gaps in our understanding of how the larynx and upper airway remodel after viral injury. To address this, we employed mouse models integrating genetics, imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics to dissect IAV-induced injury and repair in the upper respiratory tract. IAV infection displayed regionally restricted tropism toward ciliated, secretory, neuroendocrine, and basal epithelial cells, eliciting rapid clearance, acute neutrophil invasion, and a sustained intraepithelial population of cytotoxic CD8+ natural killer T (NKT)-like cells. Single-cell analysis revealed injury-induced Myc expression in KRT5+ basal progenitors, which activated a proliferative repair program and an epithelial-immune communication circuit centered on a MYC-dependent CXCL10-CXCR3 axis. Basal-specific Myc deletion preserved viral replication and clearance but blunted injury-induced proliferation, skewed lineage differentiation, and impaired CD8+NKT cell recruitment. These findings define a coordinated epithelial-immune program governing post-IAV mucosal restoration and offer mechanistic insight into persistent upper airway sequelae.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

It is known that the gut undergoes massive elongation during prenatal/embryonic stages (Weaver et al. 1991; Walton et al. 2016), in which anisotropic growth takes place. But how this characteristic organ growth is achieved remains unknown. We here demonstrate an unprecedented role of peristaltic movements in the embryonic gut elongation using a caecum as a novel model in chicken embryos. Inhibition of the peristaltic movements by chemical drugs impedes the elongation of caecum. The elongation-halted caecum restores its longitudinal growth by optogenetically introduced peristaltic movements. At the cellular level, we have found that circular smooth muscle cells divide along the circumferential axis in a peristalsis-independent manner, which would otherwise serve as an engine for the radial growth. However, with peristaltic stimulation, the cells expand collectively their distribution along the gut longitudinal axis leading to the elongation of this organ. Thus, peristaltic activity biases circumferentially proliferating smooth muscle cells toward longitudinal rearrangement. This two-step model offers a novel way to identify the peristaltic activity as a critical growth signal for the gut elongation, and also to parsimoniously explain the anisotropic growth of the gut, which undergoes the elongation while retaining its thickness.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

Analyzing 158 terrestrial mammalian species, we find a strong inverse correlation between nose-to-ground distance and the number of functional OR genes. In contrast, no significant association was found between nose-to-ground distance and the size of other chemoreceptor families, including vomeronasal and bitter-taste receptors. As a case study, we examined OR repertoire divergence between giraffe and okapi lineages, revealing that differential rates of gene duplication and pseudogenization resulted in giraffes possessing 25% fewer ORs than okapis.

Deciphering these representations offers a unique opportunity to not only interpret model decisions but also to discover novel biophysical insights governing protein properties. Here, we present a framework using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract mechanistic knowledge from PLMs fine-tuned for nanobody thermostability. Results: We fine-tuned the ESM-2 model on the nanobody thermostability dataset, achieving superior performance compared to significantly larger state-of-the-art models. SAE analysis successfully decomposed the model's dense embeddings into sparse, interpretable features without loss of predictive accuracy. We characterized these features through both global and local analyses. Global analysis revealed that stabilizing features predominantly activate on the molecular surface, optimizing charge distributions, whereas destabilizing features map to the hydrophobic core, reflecting packing defects. Local analysis identified specific interactions, including known factors like the VHH-tetrad and critical disulfide bonds, as well as novel stabilizing candidates. Free Energy Perturbation calculations confirmed that these novel candidates exhibit structural compatibility, avoiding the severe destabilization seen in neighboring residues.

Biosensors for quantification of APOBEC3A-mediated mRNA editing in living cells have yet to be developed. Here, we present HAMMER (hairpin-based APOBEC3A-mediated mRNA editing reporter), a rapid luminescence-based cellular assay for measuring RNA editing by APOBEC3A. HAMMER reports APOBEC3A activity as a reduction in the ratio of firefly to renilla luciferase activity. Briefly, tandem renilla and firefly luciferase open reading frames are separated by an optimal APOBEC3A hairpin substrate, in which C-to-U editing of a CGA motif yields a UGA stop codon thus preventing translation of the downstream firefly luciferase reporter and without impacting the upstream renilla reporter. HAMMER activation is dose-responsive, catalytic activity-dependent, and specific to human APOBEC3A. A panel of herpesviral ribonucleotide reductase constructs was used to show that direct inhibition of APOBEC3A results in a dose-responsive recovery of firefly luciferase expression.

Here, we describe an in vitro implantation model of human blastoids and hormonally matured endometrial organoids amenable to high-resolution live imaging. We demonstrate that the initial step of implantation is mediated by the direct fusion of blastoid cells with endometrial epithelial cells. Blastoids express the fusion proteins Syncytin-1 and -2, while the endometrial epithelium mainly expresses the fusion co-receptor for Syncytin-2, called MFSD2A. CRISPR-induced loss of MFSD2A in the endometrial epithelium prevents blastoids from attaching and abolishes fusion.

Although dysregulated iron handling is a recognized feature of the necrotic and hemorrhagic GBM tumor core, its relationship to invasive tumor cell states remains incompletely defined. Here, we investigated how iron-associated microenvironments relate to transcriptional programs of invasion in human GBM. Using multi-regional single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human GBM specimens encompassing tumor core, invasive front, and infiltrated cortex, we found that malignant cells from the tumor core exhibit coordinated upregulation of iron uptake and storage pathways together with invasion-associated gene programs. At the single-cell level, iron metabolism and invasion signatures were strongly correlated, defining a distinct core-enriched malignant subpopulation with mesenchymal-like transcriptional identity, stress-adaptive features, and angiogenic signaling. These iron-high/invasion-high cells aligned with mesenchymal- and astrocyte-like GBM states and were associated with unfavorable patient survival. Despite elevated oxidative stress and ferroptosis-associated transcriptional pressure, this population concurrently expressed anti-apoptotic and anti-ferroptotic regulators, consistent with an iron-tolerant invasive state. To assess functional consequences of iron exposure, we modeled iron-rich conditions using non-cytotoxic particulate iron in patient-derived GBM cell lines and human organotypic cortical slice cultures. Iron exposure induced intracellular iron accumulation, oxidative stress responses, increased tumor cell motility in vitro, and enhanced invasion within intact human brain tissue.

Our results reveal significant cellular composition differences between histologically normal and lesioned placentas, including increased extra-villous trophoblasts and leukocytes, coupled with decreases in Hofbauer cells. These changes accompanied distinctive tissue microstructural alterations, particularly increased fibrin deposition and changes to the villous structures. The magnitude of compositional deviation increased with infarction size but not with intervillous thrombosis.

Currently first-line treatment for CNVM include intravitreal injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-binding antibodies that prevent the growth of these leaky blood vessels. Unfortunately, anti-VEGF drugs often require frequent injections, and prolonged VEGF inhibition has been associated with retinal atrophy and decreased long term effectiveness in some patients.

Fourteen days following laser injury and intravitreal drug administration, CMVM size was significantly reduced in acriflavine nanocapsule and free acriflavine treated animals as compared to drug free controls. Moreover, acriflavine nanocapsules reduce CNVM incidence compared to drug free controls by approximately 25%.

In rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), an iteroparous species spawning every year, removal of the eggs from the body cavity was used as a switch to trigger the onset of the next reproductive cycle. Changes in circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) levels in blood plasma and ovarian fluid were then monitored over time. Upon removal of the eggs from the body cavity we observed the dramatic down regulation of the blood plasma levels of a single c-miRNA (miR-139-5p) that is predominantly expressed in the brain. In contrast, very distinct c-miRNAs profiles were observed in blood plasma when eggs are retained in the body cavity. Among plasma c-miRNAs showing dynamic changes with egg retention, miR-135c is strongly expressed in the brain and pituitary, while miR-457a is predominant in the postovulatory ovary. In addition, egg retention in the body cavity triggers a dramatic drop in ovarian fluid levels of miR-202-5p, a miRNA known to regulate egg production in fish.

IntegraTax visualizes genetic clusters through single-linkage clustering (''Objective Clustering'') and provides an interactive browser interface that allows users to record taxonomic decisions regarding species limits. Projects can be saved at any stage, thus allowing continuous tracking of annotations and taxonomic decisions across many sessions. A typical IntegraTax session starts with a set of sequences that are visualized as a cluster fusion diagram revealing the genetic distances between the sequences and clusters. Users can define an ''instability zone'' to distinguish clusters that are clearly distinct, likely representing separate species, from those whose status is uncertain based on genetic data alone. Based on the instability zone setting, IntegraTax then suggests which and how many specimens should be studied with a second source of data to validate species hypotheses. This process is facilitated by an interactive html environment that enables detailed specimen-level annotations. For example, a taxonomist can label which specimens have been studied, which clusters have been validated as species, and which species can be identified. By combining clustering, intuitive visualization, and easy annotation in one interactive framework, IntegraTax treats species hypotheses as annotated objects that can be inspected, revised, and exported at any stage, with documentation of examined specimens. It simultaneously allows researchers to manage taxonomy projects with tens of thousands of specimens and hundreds of species.

Most studies were assessed as having an unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting quality. The relationship between RGS scores and mechanically evoked limb withdrawal was inconsistent. These findings indicate emerging evidence to support the use of RGS in persistent pain research, but additional research is needed to strengthen these findings. Future studies could benefit from using sex-balanced animal populations with diverse genetic backgrounds.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), -synuclein (-syn) constitutes a major protein component of pathological inclusions, termed Lewy bodies. These -syn aggregates are hypothesized to spread throughout the nervous system by cell-to-cell transmission acting as templates to amplify aggregate formation. In vitro generated -syn aggregates, commonly called preformed fibrils (PFFs), have been used to investigate a number of aspects related to -syn mediated pathology across different model systems. Here we describe a semi-automated assay to screen for small molecules that interfere with the cellular uptake and accumulation of PFFs. The assay uses dopaminergic progenitor cells (DPCs), derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In an initial screen, we tested 1520 small molecules and identified several molecules that strongly reduce intracellular PFF load in DPCs. From these hits, candidate compounds were validated in dopaminergic neurons (DNs) to demonstrate the utility of the assay. This assay provides a robust, scalable and adaptable tool to screen for molecules that affect PFF uptake in hiPSC-derived cell models. Within the scope of this screen, it led to the identification of a set of compounds with diverse annotated targets that effectively reduce the uptake of synuclein aggregates in DPCs and DNs.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that the transcription factor PATZ1 reprograms chromatin accessibility in injured corticospinal neurons to promote axon regeneration, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here we use nucleosome-resolution profiling to reveal that PATZ1 induces widespread nucleosome eviction at regeneration-associated gene loci. PATZ1 treatment dramatically reduces both nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness, indicating active chromatin remodeling rather than passive destabilization. This remodeling occurs preferentially at distal regulatory elements, where PATZ1 drives a greater than 3-fold expansion of H3K27ac-marked active enhancers. Nucleosome eviction at these sites precedes enhancer activation, establishing a mechanistic link between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming.

Following its likely introduction in northeastern Europe, the pathogen rapidly colonized most regions where common ash is present. As it spread southward, H. fraxineus encountered warmer climates and a greater occurrence of Fraxinus ornus L., a species largely resistant to the disease. Despite this environmental heterogeneity, which probably imposed adaptive challenges to H. fraxineus at the epidemic front, ash dieback continues to expand in southern Europe. Aggressiveness is a key life-history trait that is expected to evolve during epidemics and to exhibit plasticity in response to environmental variation. We investigated whether the plasticity of aggressiveness in response to temperature and ash species has evolved in H. fraxineus during its propagation towards southern Europe. Using a synchronic approach based on leaf inoculations, we characterized individual reaction norms for aggressiveness in a long-established Lithuanian population and a recently established Italian population of H. fraxineus. The Italian H. fraxineus population is exposed to warmer summers than the Lithuanian population, while F. ornus is present in Italy but absent in Lithuania. We observed no difference in the aggressiveness expressed on F. excelsior under moderate temperature between the two H. fraxineus populations. However, the ability of Italian isolates to cause severe leaf symptoms was less negatively affected by increasing temperature and host species change than that of Lithuanian isolates, suggesting local adaptation of H. fraxineus during its spread toward southern Europe. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the evolution of adaptive traits and their plasticity in fungal pathogens when anticipating disease risk. They also suggest that ash trees in southern Europe may be slightly more vulnerable to ash dieback than previously anticipated.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

Short Artificial Introns (SAIs) have emerged as powerful tools to simplify allele design and characterization, yet practical guidelines for their implementation remain limited. Here, we describe two streamlined strategies, eSPLIT (exon split) and iSWAP (intron swap), that enable efficient generation of conditional alleles using SAIs. In eSPLIT, a compact cassette containing essential intronic elements flanked by loxP sites is integrated within an exon, whereas in iSWAP, a native intron is replaced with an SAI. In the absence of Cre recombinase, the SAI is recognized as an intron and removed by the splicing machinery, allowing normal gene expression. Following Cre-mediated recombination, excision of critical intronic sequences disrupts splicing, leaving residual sequences, including stop codons in all reading frames, thereby causing premature translation termination and gene inactivation. We optimized these approaches by generating a series of 18 SCYL1 alleles in human cells, validated their general applicability in 5 mouse models across multiple genes, and further extended the approach to the FLP-FRT system in vivo. By defining practical rules for SAI placement, we establish a robust and scalable framework for engineering conditional alleles, with broad utility in functional genomics and disease modeling.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

A popular method, short nascent strand sequencing (SNS-seq or NS-seq), enriches newly replicated short single-stranded DNA by size selection and {lambda} exonuclease ({lambda}-exo) digestion of parental DNA. Surprisingly, SNS-seq has never been validated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae where origins have been well characterized genome-wide. We improved the SNS-seq protocol through biochemical optimization and benchmarked its origin-mapping sensitivity and precision with traditional SNS-seq in asynchronous populations of S. cerevisiae. The improved SNS-seq protocol significantly enhanced the enrichment of origin-derived DNA. Strikingly, the traditional SNS-seq failed to detect known origins and instead enriched non-origin DNA, likely arising from RNA:DNA hybrids. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of previously published datasets that rely on {lambda}-exo for origin mapping.

Using 16S rRNA sequencing, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) quantification, LC-MS/MS lipidomics, and cytokine profiling, we identified divergent coping strategies across brain, metabolic and intestinal tissues and reproductive organs. In females, LL induced microbial restructuring, with enrichment of Rikenellaceae, Butyricicoccaceae, and Alistipes, but these changes were uncoupled from short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) output. Also, they engaged N-acylethanolamine (NAE)-driven endocannabinoidome signaling in the brain (AEA, DHEA, OEA, PEA, SEA), accompanied by omega-6 prostaglandin upregulation and increased cytokines (IL-5, IFN-{gamma}, MIP-2). The 2-monoacyl glycerols (2-MAGs) increased selectively in liver and skeletal muscle, reflecting tissue-specific lipid remodeling.

Here, we investigate the role of the Drosophila melanogaster GalNAc-T1 ortholog PGANT5 in salivary glands and provide structural and biochemical details into its mechanism of O-glycosylation. We find that loss of pgant5 causes irregular secretory granule morphology, altered mucin packaging, and disruption of secretion. Alternative splicing of pgant5 yields two isoforms, pgant5A and pgant5B, with higher expression of pgant5A in salivary glands. Rescue with pgant5A, but not pgant5B, partially restores secretory granule morphology and salivary gland function. A single residue difference within the substrate binding pockets of PGANT5A and PGANT5B increases the in vitro activity and specificity of PGANT5A towards salivary gland mucins relative to PGANT5B, corroborating the in vivo expression and role of pgant5A in salivary glands.

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification has become a well-established standard for exchanging data among health data systems. While designed primarily for clinical and patient data in health care environments, it also has applicability to represent genomic research data and offers a path for aggregating and integrating extremely rich datasets that have traditionally remained siloed and disparate. To study this potential, we developed FHIR Aggregator, an integration of seven major biomedical repositories, including the Genomic Data Commons, GTEx, HTAN, and DepMap, that covered 142334 patients, 819251 specimens, 1096491 observations and 711166 documents. We explore the various ways the FHIR standard can be applied to structure genomic research data and enable new possibilities. We demonstrate how FHIR can be used, where it succeeds or falls short, and which concepts must be extended to better support large-scale clinical and genomics research projects.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

In spatially structured populations such as biofilms and solid tumors, resistance-mediated therapy failure is driven not only by a continuous supply of de novo mutations and treatment selection, but by where resistant mutants arise relative to spatial resource gradients and how therapy reshapes these patterns. A fundamental mechanistic understanding of such couplings is essential to better predict therapy outcome and inform the principled design of spatio-evolutionary therapies. However, we currently lack experimentally tractable model systems that allow for a systematic, quantitative tracking of mutant emergence and expansion under time-modulated therapy in compact, range-expanding populations. Here, we introduce a high-throughput microbial therapy-mimicry assay based on colonies expanded from single genetically-tailored yeast cells. This platform enables direct observation of the full spatio-temporal trajectories of continually emerging resistant clones under programmable treatment schedules. Connecting experimental observations to an interpretable digital twin in a real-to-sim-to-real loop, we uncover an effective phase transition in metronomic schedule space that defines an optimal balance between population control with sustained resistance confinement, which we validate experimentally. Together, our results establish resource-mediated spatial confinement as a central organizing principle of resistance evolution and provide a mechanistic foundation for spatially informed, evolution-based therapies.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

GAUT1 has the greatest in vitro enzyme activity of the six confirmed Arabidopsis HG biosynthetic GAUTs, but its biological activity remains elusive. Here we show that Arabidopsis GAUT1 homozygous mutants have a severe dwarfed seedling phenotype, survive several weeks as 2 to 3 mm seedlings, and have severely reduced shoot and root growth and hypocotyl epidermal, cortex and endodermal cell size. gaut1-1 pollen tubes are shorter than WT with increased bursting. Complementation of homozygous gaut1-1 with GAUT1 coding sequence driven by the GAUT1 promoter restored WT-like growth. The extreme dwarf phenotype of homozygous gaut1-1 seedlings precluded their use for detailed cell wall analysis, thus suspensions cultures were produced from callus generated from mutant and WT seedlings. Homozygous gaut1-1 suspension cells were smaller than WT with ~30% reduced wall GalA content compared to WT. Sequential extraction of the walls with increasingly harsh solvents and sugar composition analysis revealed reduced GalA content in only the 4M KOH post-chlorite fraction, indicating that GAUT1-synthesized HG was held tightly in the wall by direct or indirect hydrogen bonding and/or oxidation-sensitive linkages. Treatment of wall fractions with endopolygalacturonase to hydrolyze HG and gel electrophoretic separation of hydrolysates exposed an HG-associated doublet band markedly downregulated in the homozygous gaut1-1 4M KOH post-chlorite fraction and to a lesser extent in 4M KOH and sodium chlorite fractions. NMR analysis identified the band as rhamnogalacturonan (RG)-II. Super resolution microscopy using anti-HG antibodies showed that, compared to WT, the homozygous gaut1-1 hypocotyl epidermal and callus cells had reduced content and length of HG nanofilaments, HG fibers associated with cell expansion in Arabidopsis.

Small perturbations introduced during processing can propagate through complex pipelines, leading to variability in outcomes and raising concerns about the reproducibility of reported findings. Addressing this issue requires systematic evaluation of pipeline stability to ensure results remain within acceptable numerical limits. While the numerical variability of structural imaging workflows has been investigated, with findings ranging from stable to highly variable, functional MRI (fMRI) pipelines and their derived graph measures remain underexplored. Without rigorous stability assessment, conclusions drawn from these measures may remain uncertain. We systematically evaluated the numerical variability of graph measures of functional connectivity derived from the widely-used fMRIPrep pipeline and compared it to population variability. The resulting Numerical-Population Variability Ratio (NPVR) values ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 for most graph metrics, indicating a measurable influence of numerical variability on network-derived outcomes.

R.; Obrietan, K.", "abstract": "Disruption of the circadian timing system has been reported in the preclinical phase of Alzheimers disease (AD) and is a well-characterized component of mid- and late-stage AD. Given the distributed nature of the circadian timing system, with a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral clocks throughout the brain, understanding how AD affects this system has been challenging. To investigate how AD may disrupt circadian physiology, we focused on the amyloid-beta peptide, a key contributor to familial early-onset AD. Using the 5xFAD mouse model and ex vivo single-cell profiling, we examined how amyloid-beta influences clock timing in both SCN neurons and hippocampal neuronal populations. Circadian profiling of 5xFAD mice (4- and 8-months-old) showed only modest changes in key clock timing properties, including a shortening of the SCN rhythm. Interestingly, the mice showed enhanced rates of re-entrainment to changes in the light cycle, suggesting that elevated amyloid-beta levels increase the sensitivity of the SCN clock to light. Further, using both in vitro SCN slice explant and dispersed SCN culture models, the exogenous administration of oligomerized amyloid-beta had no significant effect on inherent clock timing capacity. In contrast, the timing properties of cultured hippocampal neurons showed a dose-dependent sensitivity to amyloid-beta. This included an elevated mesor and an increased rhythm amplitude. These findings reveal a divergence in amyloid-beta sensitivity between the central SCN clock and peripheral oscillators. This raises the possibility that circadian disruptions in AD may stem from both the destabilization and decoupling of peripheral oscillators from the central timing properties of the SCN.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

Our approach discretizes reward distributions through a finite set of neurons, consistent with recent empirical findings on distributional coding in the brain. We validate our framework by reproducing established results across three iconic domains spanning individual exploration versus exploitation, social coordination, and risky choice. Beyond validation, we uncover novel interactions among optimism, reward discretization, and temporal discounting. Specifically, we identify conditions under which choice hysteresis and path-dependent strategies emerge, suggesting that perseveration results from neural reward discretization rather than constituting an independent heuristic. We further reveal \"individual dilemmas\": circumstances where agents gravitate toward suboptimal yet stable strategies, offering a mechanistic explanation for incoherent choice patterns.

Wnt signaling contributes to tissue responses following ischemic stroke, but its precise role in post-injury glial remodeling is not fully understood. Here, we define how Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling shapes NG2 glial behavior after focal cerebral ischemia. Using genetic mouse models enabling cell-specific Wnt pathway activation or inhibition, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiological recording, we disclosed a central role for Wnt signaling in post-injury fate specification. We identified 12 transcriptionally distinct subpopulations within the oligodendroglial lineage, including a subset with an astrocyte-like transcriptional profile. Wnt signaling strongly influenced the balance between OPC proliferation and differentiation: pathway hyperactivation impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and expanded astrocyte-like NG2-derived cells, likely through concomitant activation of the Notch pathway. Remarkably, Wnt hyperactivation also induced the appearance of cholinergic neuron-like cells derived from NG2-expressing cells exclusively in the somatosensory cortex; these cells generated action potentials and exhibited sodium conductance characteristic of functional neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate that NG2 glia undergo distinct fate transitions after stroke and that their lineage plasticity is highly sensitive to Wnt pathway dynamics. Targeted fine-tuning of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling may enable directed redirection of NG2 glia toward specific reparative outcomes, including neuronal reprogramming, in the injured adult brain.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

We studied the neural mechanisms of willed attention control by analyzing fMRI and EEG data recorded at two institutions (UF and UC Davis) using the same willed attention paradigm. The findings include: (1) both instructional cues and the choice cue activated the DAN, (2) the choice cue additionally activated a frontoparietal decision network consisting of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), anterior insula (AI), anterior prefrontal cortex (APFC), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), (3) the decision about where to attend can be decoded in frontoparietal decision network in choice trials but not in instructional trials, and (4) EEG alpha oscillation patterns immediately preceding the choice cue, but not the instructional cues, predicted the postcue direction of attention and the frontoparietal decision network activity.

Like Fireko mice, they lack microglia and subpopulations of resident macrophages in kidney and heart, but retain the other brain associated macrophages and resident populations in the liver, spleen and lungs. In contrast to mutant mice, macrophages in the peritoneum are unaffected and CSF1R expression is not completely abolished in the blood. Aside from the loss of microglia-specific transcripts, the Fireko has no effect on expression of genes associated with neurons, oligodendrocytes or astrocytes in adult rats but is associated with detectable calcification in the thalamus. Despite the absence of microglia we detected no significant differences in ethologically relevant behaviours compared to littermates.

In laboratory experiments, we found that A. cf. rufescens had more than 30-fold higher offspring emergence from D. suzukii when L. japonica was also present. This facilitation occurred most frequently when A. cf. rufescens parasitized D. suzukii after L. japonica, possibly because parasitism by L. japonica destroyed the hosts' cellular immunity that would otherwise prevent A. cf. rufescens development.

Previous laboratory studies conducted to assess the ecological risk of classical biological control introductions suggested that G. kimorum is highly host-specific, whereas L. japonica can develop in several other drosophilid species. Information on realized host use of the parasitoids under field conditions in the context of host-parasitoid food webs in their non-native range is limited. A two-year field study in coastal British Columbia, Canada was conducted, using complementary sampling methods to document host-parasitoid associations and quantify parasitoid specificity with respect to drosophilid communities inhabiting ripe and rotting fruit. Consistent with previous laboratory findings, G. kimorum was reared exclusively from D. suzukii, while L. japonica emerged primarily from D. suzukii but also from D. melanogaster and, less frequently, from members of the D. obscura species group. Leptopilina japonica shared some host species with the resident parasitoid species L. heterotoma and Asobara cf. rufescens. A particularly striking result was the extent to which almost all drosophilid and parasitoid taxa in this study's host-parasitoid trophic webs were non-native, complicating the interpretation of non-target ecological effects of L. japonica.

In the context of data reuse, the FAIRification of these extensive datasets is frequently perceived as a secondary administrative task, addressed only after data analysis has been completed. However, this approach overlooks the potential benefits of early metadata integration as the procedures for processing and analyzing raw data are primarily dictated by the underlying research design and experimental conditions. Gathering interoperable research metadata at the earliest stages creates a standardized basis for managing, processing, and analyzing data enabling more efficient and reproducible FAIR workflows. Results: The single containment principle was used to develop modular containerized reproducible workflows that support the FAIR principles for research software by systematically capturing standardized metadata for each data processing step along with the resulting data products. Using defined mock metagenomic datasets as an example, we show that interoperable research metadata can be used to drive such computational workflows. By processing raw data accordingly, machine-actionable provenance chains are created that enhance the reproducibility and reusability of the resulting data products. Conclusions: A seamless integration of wet lab experiments with computational investigations is essential for a FAIR end-to-end research process. Meta-data-managed workflows prevent the need for unnecessary data manipulation. Workflow provenance registration explicates the complex multi-step methods employed for data processing and analysis.

R.; Shehu, A.", "abstract": "Multimodal neural networks integrating protein language models (PLMs) with structure-derived features are increasingly common for predicting mutation effects, yet fundamental mechanisms remain poorly characterized. In this paper, we articulate and address two key questions: (i) do these architectures exploit mutation-conditioned structural changes, and (ii) does structure provide additive value over PLM-learned sequence embeddings afterall? Using melting temperature shift prediction as a controlled testbed, a phenotype expected to depend strongly on three-dimensional geometry, we introduce generalizable diagnostic methodologies: systematic channel ablations quantifying each modality's marginal contribution, and context-radius probing, a novel technique restricting inputs to progressively larger neighborhoods around mutations to spatially localize predictive signal. Across ten independent runs per condition, we find PLM embeddings dominate: removing structure causes minimal performance change, while removing PLMs causes performance collapse. Context-radius probing reveals signal is highly localized; mutation-site-only models recover full-context performance. Critically, comparing wild-type-shared versus mutation-conditioned structural regimes reveals no systematic gain from geometric perturbations, demonstrating that current representations function as static fold priors because downstream featurization attenuates mutation-induced changes. However, structure helps selectively: benefits concentrate in variants with atypical PLM embeddings occupying phenotypically incoherent neighborhoods where sequence-derived priors are locally unreliable. Though focused on a controlled testbed, this work surfaces a key challenge for any protein prediction task where domain knowledge suggests structure should matter: not whether to \"add structure,\" but how to represent and integrate geometry so that it contributes distinct signal beyond strong sequence priors. We provide architecture-agnostic diagnostics to test and quantify when and how explicit structure delivers that added value.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

All five neuromodulators examined, acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, histamine, and NE, exhibited synchronized infraslow cortical oscillations during NREM sleep. Optogenetic suppression of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons abolished NE oscillations and selectively reduced acetylcholine fluctuations in barrel cortex, whereas targeted inhibition of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons attenuated REM-associated acetylcholine elevations without disrupting NREM-related oscillations or NE dynamics.

G protein-coupled neuromodulator receptors can regulate OPC fate, but the role of individual G protein families is unclear. Here, we use chemogenetics to directly investigate the role of Gq and Gi proteins in OPC fate. We find that expressing the DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) hM3Dq or hM4Di in OPCs without activating them with designer agonists induces constitutive G protein signalling, which alters bioelectrical membrane properties such as voltage-gated ion channels and glutamate receptors in OPCs. Further, we find that hM3Dq or hM4Di expression alone modulates OPC fate, increasing or decreasing differentiation, respectively, suggesting that directly targeting G protein signalling can be used to bidirectionally regulate differentiation. Importantly, our data raise a note of caution regarding the use of DREADDs in both excitable and non-excitable small cells.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

To better understand the lack of sustained protection post-vaccination, we analyzed CSP-specific B cells over time in malaria-naive individuals following immunization with RTS,S/AS01 followed by controlled malaria infection. Longitudinal analyses revealed a shift in the repertoire and regional protein specificity of CSP-specific B cells over time. Early post-vaccine responses were dominated by class-switched memory B cells (MBCs) specific for the NANP-repeat region of CSP, epitopes associated with protective antibodies. However, the frequency of NANP-repeat-specific MBCs declines, while longer-term memory responses, including responses both before and after a malaria challenge, had increased frequencies of MBCs specific for the C-terminus of CSP. Despite class-switching and affinity maturation, C-term monoclonal antibodies derived from these MBCs failed to protect mice against a transgenic parasite challenge. Taken together, these findings suggest that RTS,S/AS01 induces a transient, protective NANP-repeat-specific B cell response that is subsequently replaced by B cells with non-protective reactivities, potentially explaining its limited long-term efficacy.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

We evaluated genital tract infection with Chlamydia muridarum across 20 Collaborative Cross (CC) strains, a recombinant inbred mouse panel that captures broad genetic diversity with high within - strain reproducibility. CC strains exhibited striking differences in early bacterial burden, time to clearance, and oviduct pathology, including prolonged low-inflammatory infections and burden -- pathology discordance that mirror key features of human disease. Heritability analyses demonstrated that host genetics accounted for most of the variation observed in Day 7 bacterial burden and pathological outcomes. Genome-wide scans identified suggestive quantitative trait loci associated with both traits. Genes within the burden-associated locus converged on host pathways implicated in chlamydial intracellular growth, including membrane dynamics and lipid metabolism, ubiquitin signaling, host cell survival mechanisms, and immune regulatory signaling. In contrast, genes within the pathology-associated locus were enriched for pathways regulating inflammatory cell recruitment, inflammasome activation, and tissue remodeling, processes central to genital tract damage following infection. Cervical transcriptional profiling further revealed strain-dependent innate and adaptive immune programs associated with bacterial burden and disease phenotype. Together, these findings establish the CC as a powerful platform for dissecting the genetic architecture of chlamydial immunopathogenesis, and for improving preclinical evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

However, the enhancer-based regulatory mechanisms governing this process remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we generated the first three-dimensional epigenomic roadmap of human B-cell differentiation in vivo. By profiling nine differentiation stages, we linked nearly half a million enhancers to their target genes through chromatin interactions, defined their activity states, and predicted bound transcription factors. We show that the acquisition of B-cell identity, distinct from common cellular processes, relies on large enhancer networks acting additively and synergistically to finely tune transcription. We further identify a 3D epigenetic priming mechanism underlying immune memory, whereby memory B cells retain primed DNA loops that enable faster responses to antigen re-exposure. Extending this roadmap to disease, we demonstrate that B-cell malignancies preserve enhancer signatures of their cell of origin while silencing distal tumor suppressor control. Finally, we uncover a previously unappreciated oncogenic mechanism in which intragenic deletions disrupt distal gene regulation via enhancer loss.

L.; Coop, G.", "abstract": "In avocado and certain wild relatives in Lauraceae, pollination occurs via a synchronized rhythm of floral sex timing between two hermaphroditic flowering types. A-type plants present female-phase flowers in the morning and male-phase flowers in the afternoon, while B-types show the complementary pattern, a form of heterodichogamy. We map this dimorphism in avocado to a genomic region overlapping a single strong candidate gene, SDMYB, where a dominant haplotype confers A-type flowering. SDMYB belongs to a subgroup of R2R3 MYB transcription factors established as key regulators of floral maturation in diverse species with links to circadian jasmonate signaling. Haplotypes at this locus form an ancient trans-species polymorphism maintained by negative frequency-dependent balancing selection over 44 million years, and they segregate in at least 26 non-avocado species, including in a genus where this mating system has not been reported. Across several species examined, rhythmic diel SDMYB expression is associated with biphasic floral anthesis, and the dominant allele, which contains nonsynonymous changes in conserved functional domains, exhibits a cis-regulated phase delay, corresponding to the delayed 2nd anthesis of A-types. The coupling of dichogamy with diel flower movements, widespread among magnoliids, is a likely precursor to daily forms of heterodichogamy. Absence of the SDMYB polymorphism in true cinnamon, which exhibits a highly similar mating system, suggests the possibility that heterodichogamy has convergently evolved within Lauraceae.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

The resulting chimera, EP-LanM, undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation upon REE binding, forming condensates whose formation and dynamic properties are governed by metal stoichiometry and temperature. These condensates enable selective capture and release of La3+ and Nd3+ and support efficient recovery and reuse of the protein.

Structure-function coupling (SFC) is a promising multimodal marker that is sensitive to developmental plasticity. While emerging evidence suggests cortical SFC is sensitive to adversity exposure during early childhood, it is unknown how SFC in stress-sensitive corticolimbic circuits links adversity exposure with mental health across development. We examined associations between adversity exposure, transdiagnostic symptomatology, and both amygdala-cortical and hippocampal-cortical SFC across development in a large sample of youth (N = 607, 39% F). Results revealed that adversity exposure moderated age-related change in amygdala-vmPFC SFC (p = .007), such that youth exposed to higher, but not lower, levels of adversity showed an age-related increase in amygdala-vmPFC SFC. Further, amygdala-vmPFC SFC buffered the effect of adversity on internalizing symptoms (p = .012), such that those youth with higher adversity exposure who had stronger amygdala-vmPFC SFC also displayed lower internalizing symptoms. Separately, higher adversity exposure was associated with lower hippocampal-limbic network SFC (p = .037), which moderated the effect of adversity on internalizing symptoms (p = .010). These findings highlight that structural and functional neurodevelopment of amygdala-vmPFC and hippocampal-limbic network connections may adapt in distinct ways to support mental health following adversity, with implications for risk and resilience against internalizing psychopathology.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

While several systems maintain OM integrity during stress, the roles of many outer membrane lipoproteins are less well characterized. Here, we identify YfgH, a glycine-zipper domain containing lipoprotein, as a novel OM-stabilizing factor that functions distinctly from the previously studied SlyB. Deletion of yfgH increases sensitivity to detergents and metal chelators, enhances OM permeability, and leads to global loss of OM proteins under stress. YfgH is essential for survival during CRISPR interference-mediated depletion of OM biogenesis genes, and its overexpression rescues these phenotypes. AlphaFold modeling predicts YfgH forms oligomeric ring-like structures similar to SlyB, but genetic suppressor screens indicate distinct mechanisms: clsA (cardiolipin synthase) mutations suppress yfgH deletion, while slyB suppressors map to the Mla lipid transport pathway. Biochemical analyses reveal YfgH interacts with multiple OM proteins, especially under stress. Together these findings suggest YfgH functions by stabilizing cardiolipin-rich nanodomains, representing a novel response to OM stress. This work expands our understanding of glycine-zipper lipoproteins as stress-specific membrane stabilizers and highlights the critical role of YfgH in preserving OM integrity during envelope perturbation.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that immunomodulatory nanoparticles (NPs) can harness this endogenous antifibrotic capacity by catalyzing monocyte activation leading to resolution of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Cargo-free NPs comprised of the degradable biopolymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) induce a transcriptional shift toward antifibrotic immune activation in profibrotic M2 macrophages (M{Phi}s) in vitro. NPs stimulate M2 M{Phi}s toward a glycolytic, rather than fatty acid oxidative, metabolism; suppress canonical M2 markers like arginase-1 (Arg1) and periostin (Postn); and upregulate collagenases, hyaluronidases and immunoregulatory factors. When delivered intravenously in vivo, NPs reverse established bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and invert the trajectory of over 1,000 genes from pre- to post-treatment according to bulk RNA-sequencing. NPs also suppress profibrotic signaling and increase expression of repair-associated pathways like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-{gamma}), nuclear retinoic acid receptor (RAR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and sphingolipid signaling in fibrotic lungs. Flow cytometry confirms that NPs induce monocyte recruitment to fibrotic lungs via enhanced integrin expression. Altogether, NPs induce a robust pro-regenerative signature comprised of ECM degradation, inflammation resolution, and tissue repair pathways, concomitant with increased NP+ monocyte recruitment to fibrotic lungs. This work demonstrates that monocytes are not intrinsically profibrotic, but rather, their effects are context-dependent, and they retain a capacity for fibrotic resolution under conditions that can be induced by materials with translational potential.", "date": "2025-12-24", "journal": ""}

Whether these xanomeline treatment effects extend to methamphetamine self-administration remains unknown. The first aim established the economic substitutability between methamphetamine and liquid food (i.e., Ensure) using a methamphetamine-vs-food choice procedure in male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) and Long Evans (LE) rats. A within-session methamphetamine choice dose-effect function (0.032-0.32 mg/kg/infusion) was determined daily, and food reinforcer magnitude was manipulated weekly by changing the concentration (0, 10, 32, and 100%) of vanilla-flavored Ensure. Additionally, methamphetamine response requirement (i.e., fixed ratio (FR) 1, 5, 25, 125) was manipulated each week while holding the food FR constant. The second aim determined the effectiveness of repeated 5-day xanomeline (3.2-10 mg/kg, SC) to attenuate methamphetamine choice. Both increasing Ensure concentrations and methamphetamine FR values resulted in rightward shifts in the methamphetamine choice dose-effect function in both SD and LE rats. Repeated 5-day xanomeline treatment significantly decreased methamphetamine choice across all doses tested in LE, but not SD, rats.
