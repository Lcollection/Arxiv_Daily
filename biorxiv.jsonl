Here, we report that mice lacking the bile acid regulators, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), recapitulate the sex difference in liver cancer risk. Since few therapeutic options are available, we focused on understanding the intrinsic protection afforded to female livers. Transcriptomic analysis in control and FXR and SHP double knockout livers identified female-specific changes in metabolism, including amino acids, lipids, and steroids. We examined if the obtained transcriptomic signatures correlate with the survival outcomes for HCC patients to assess the translational potential of this murine HCC model. Gene signatures that are unique to the knockout females correspond with low-grade tumors and better survival. Ovariectomy blunts the metabolic changes in female livers and promotes tumorigenesis that, intriguingly, coincides with increases in serum bile acid (BA) levels. Despite similar genetics, we found higher serum BA concentrations in males, whereas female knockout mice excreted more BAs. Decreasing enterohepatic BA recirculation using cholestyramine, an FDA-approved resin, dramatically reduced the liver cancer burden in male mice. Overall, we reveal that sex-specific BA metabolism leading to lower circulating BA concentration protects female livers from developing cancer. Thus, targeting BA excretion may be a promising therapeutic strategy against HCC.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

However, our previous findings indicate that the unconventional myosin, MYO19, interacts with MIRO weakly and that a MIRO-independent MOM-localizing domain interacts more tightly with the MOM. To test the hypothesis that other MIRO interactors may also have MIRO-independent MOM-binding, we examined interactions between TRAK proteins (microtubule motor-mitochondria adaptor proteins) and the MOM via quantitative fluorescence microscopy and steady-state kinetic approaches. Using GFP-TRAK truncations expressed in MIRO1-2 double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we identified a MIRO-independent mitochondrial binding domain in the C-terminus of TRAK1 and TRAK2, sufficient for MOM-localization similar to what we observed for full length GFP-TRAK proteins. The MIRO-binding domains (MBD) of the TRAK proteins were only able to localize to mitochondria in the presence of ectopic expression of MIRO. Importantly, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) demonstrated that the steady-state kinetics of TRAKMBD/MIRO interactions were faster-exchanging than for either full-length TRAK or the TRAK C-terminal MOM-binding domain expressed alone. These data support a model where faster-exchanging TRAK/MIRO associations could support initial association and/or TRAK activation, while MIRO-independent binding contributes significantly to tighter association to the MOM.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Many biomolecule networks are known to have multi-scale module structures, which may be helpful for studying complex diseases, but the mining and utilization of multi-scale module structure is an open issue. Therefore, we present a kind of novel hybrid network-based method (HyMSMK) for disease-gene identification through incorporating multi-scale module kernel in biomolecule networks. We first apply exponential sampling to construct multi-scale module profile containing local to global structural information, where modules at different scales are extracted from comprehensive interactome by multi-scale modularity optimization. Then, the multi-scale module profile is preprocessed by the relative information content, and is used to generate multi-scale module kernel, which is further preprocessed by kernel sparsification. We design multiple schemes for incorporating multi-scale module kernel to discover potential disease-related genes. We investigate the performance of these schemes by experimental evaluations, show the positive effect of kernel sparsification on reducing the requirement for space and time, and confirm the superior performance of our method compared to other state-of-art network-based baselines.

By chronic microendoscopy, we observed robust yet adaptable representations of pup-directed anticipatory and motor-related activities within the OFC. Some of these plastic responses were significantly overlapped with those related to nonsocial reward signals. The inactivation of OFC output reduced the phasic activities of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons specifically tied to pup retrieval and impaired the modulation of DA release to the ventral striatum during the acquisition of alloparental behaviors. These findings suggest that the OFC transiently boosts DA activity during the acquisition phase, thereby facilitating the manifestation of alloparental behaviors.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

The ERM hyperphosphorylation was accompanied by decreased astrocyte morphological complexity and reduced excitatory synapse density and function. Dampening ERM phosphorylation levels in LRRK2 G2019S mouse astrocytes restored both their morphology and the excitatory synapse density in the anterior cingulate cortex. To determine how LRRK2 mutation impacts Ezrin interactome, we used an in vivo BioID proteomic approach, and we found that astrocytic Ezrin interacts with Atg7, a master regulator of autophagy. The Ezrin/Atg7 interaction is inhibited by Ezrin phosphorylation, thus diminished in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes. Importantly, the Atg7 function is required to maintain proper astrocyte morphology.

To investigate this, we generated a single-nucleus RNA sequencing atlas of 36 human postmortem prefrontal cortex samples, including 12 carriers of ABCA7 LoF variants and 24 matched non-carriers. ABCA7 LoF variants were associated with transcriptional changes across all major neural cell types. Excitatory neurons, which expressed the highest levels of ABCA7, showed significant alterations in oxidative phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, DNA damage responses, and synaptic signaling pathways. ABCA7 LoF-associated transcriptional changes in neurons were similarly perturbed in carriers of the common AD missense variant ABCA7 p.Ala1527Gly (n = 240 controls, 135 carriers) - predicted by molecular dynamic simulations to disrupt ABCA7 structure -, indicating that findings from our study may extend to large portions of the at-risk population. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying ABCA7 LoF variants closely recapitulated the transcriptional changes observed in human postmortem neurons. Biochemical experiments further demonstrated that ABCA7 LoF disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential via regulated uncoupling, increases oxidative stress, and alters phospholipid homeostasis in neurons, notably elevating saturated phosphatidylcholine levels. Supplementation with CDP-choline to enhance de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis effectively reversed these transcriptional changes, restored mitochondrial uncoupling, and reduced oxidative stress. Additionally, CDP-choline normalized amyloid-{beta} secretion and alleviated neuronal hyperexcitability in ABCA7 LoF neurons. This study provides a detailed transcriptomic profile of ABCA7 LoF-induced changes and highlights phosphatidylcholine metabolism as a key driver in ABCA7-induced risk.

Corresponding theory centers around the R* rule, according to which consumers who share a single limiting resource cannot coexist. Here we model motile consumers that directly interfere while handling resources, mechanistically capturing both exploitative and interference competition. Our analytical coexistence conditions show that interference competition readily promotes coexistence. In contrast to previous theory, coexistence does not require intra-specific interference propensities to exceed inter-specific interference propensities, nor for interference behaviors to carry a direct (rather than merely an opportunity) cost. The underlying mechanism of coexistence can resemble the hawk-dove game, the dominance-discovery trade-off (akin to the competition-colonization trade-off), or a novel trade-off we call the \"dove-discovery trade-off\", depending on parameter values. Competitive exclusion via the R* rule occurs only when differences in exploitative abilities swamp other differences between species, and more easily when differences in R* reflect different search speeds than when they reflect different handling times.

We propose a framework called \"TReD\" (Transcriptome-informed Reversal Distance) that integrates population-level disease signatures robust to reverse causality and cell-based, drug-induced transcriptome response profiles. TReD embeds the disease signature and drug response profiles in a high-dimensional normed space, quantifying the reversal potential of candidate drugs in a disease-related cell-based screening.

We assayed 60,000 developing neurons across three timepoints with CellPainting, a high-content imaging method, and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). By modeling the relationship between morphological features and gene expression within our differentiation system, we annotated image-based features with biological functions and found that while phenotypes related to cell morphology capture broader neuronal classes than scRNA-seq, they enhance our ability to quantify the biological processes that drive neuronal differentiation over time, such as mitochondrial function and cell cycle. Further, we found that while over 60% of the cells match those seen in the fetal brain, 28% represented metabolically abnormal cell states and broader neuronal classes specific to in vitro cells. Finally, we show that specific subtypes of iPSC-derived cortical neurons are a relevant model for a range of brain-related complex traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, highlighting the potential of multi-modal single cell phenotyping for disease modeling.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Several possibilities, including myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clones, may explain this. However, the precise mechanisms remain controversial. Utilizing the Hoxb5 reporter system to prospectively isolate long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) and short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), we found that young and aged LT-HSCs co-transplanted into the same recipients demonstrated nearly equivalent myeloid lineage output, contrary to the theory of myeloid-biased HSC clones. Transcriptomics indicated no significant myeloid gene enrichment in aged LT-HSCs compared to their young counterparts. Instead, transplanting reconstituted young HSCs with the ratio of LT/ST-HSCs seen in aged mice can significantly skew the lineage output to myeloid cells. In addition, while the niche environment in the bone marrow minimally affects myeloid-biased hematopoiesis, aged thymi and spleens substantially hinder lymphoid hematopoiesis, resulting in further myeloid-domination.

These structural defects alter the cortical distribution of cIN, which moreover exhibit intrinsic migration defects and cortical trajectories resembling those of cyclopamine-treated cIN.

Thalamic inputs induce a pause mediated by intrinsic mechanisms and regulated by dopamine D2 receptors, though the underlying membrane currents are unknown. Moreover, the role of D5 receptors (D5R) has not been addressed so far. Here, we performed ex vivo studies showing that glutamate released by thalamic inputs in the dorsolateral striatum induces a burst in SCIN, followed by a pause mediated by the activation of a Kv1-dependent delayed rectifier current. Endogenous dopamine promotes this pause through D2R stimulation, while pharmacological stimulation of D5R suppresses it. Remarkably, this pause is absent in parkinsonian mice rendered dyskinetic by chronic L-DOPA treatment but can be reinstated acutely by the inverse D5R agonist clozapine. Blocking the Kv1 current eliminates the pause reinstated by the D5R inverse agonist. In contrast, the D2-type receptor agonists quinpirole and sumanirole failed to reinstate a pause in dyskinetic mice. In conclusion, stimulation of thalamic inputs induces an excitation followed by a pause in SCIN, which is lost in parkinsonian mice that have been rendered dyskinetic. This pause is mediated by delayed rectifier Kv1 channels, which are tonically blocked in dyskinetic mice by a mechanism depending on D5R ligand-independent activity.

Using ex vivo electrophysiology, we describe a transient increase in the intrinsic excitability of excitatory neurons in layer IV of the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input, immediately following the onset of active whisking around on postnatal days 13 and 14. This increase in neuronal gain is specific to layer IV, independent of changes in synaptic strength, and requires prior sensory experience. Further, these effects are not expressed in inhibitory in-terneurons in barrel cortex. The transient increase in excitability is not evident in layer II/III of barrel cortex or in the visual cortex upon eye opening, suggesting a unique interaction between the development of active sensing and the thalamocortical input layer in the somatosensory iso-cortex. Predictive modeling indicates that, immediately following the onset of active whisking, changes in active membrane conductances alone can reliably distinguish neurons in control but not whisker-deprived hemispheres. Our findings demonstrate an experience-dependent, lamina-specific refinement of neuronal excitability tightly linked to the emergence of active whisking. This tran-sient increase in the gain of the thalamic input layer coincides with a critical period for synaptic plasticity in downstream layers, suggesting a role in cortical maturation and sensory processing.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Z.; Chang, C.; Jean Chen, J.", "abstract": "An understanding of neurofluid dynamics has been gaining importance, in part given the link between neurofluid dynamics and glymphatic flow. Recently, CSF pulsations have been attributed to widespread changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) driven by sleep-state slow-wave electrocortical activity (Fultz et al., 2019), by localized neuronal activity (Williams et al., 2023), by respiration-related autonomic tone (Picchioni et al., 2022) and by vigilance (Z. Yang et al., 2024). It was further suggested that the slow-wave induced CSF pulsations are in fact driven by autonomic (ANS) regulation (Picchioni et al., 2022), and that CSF dynamics are ultimately modulated by ANS mechanisms instead of by sleep per se. To further understand the role of this ANS regulation of vascular tone independently of sleep, and given the established influence of carbon dioxide (CO2) on both ANS tone and vascular tone, we hypothesized that a modulation of basal CO2, producing altered global vascular tone and respiration, may highlight the role of ANS regulation in driving CSF flow, and more broadly, neurofluid flow. In this work, we report on observations of neurofluid dynamics at awake normocapnia as well as mild hyper- and hypocapnia steady states. We use the resting-state BOLD fMRI time courses in neurofluid regions (i.e. blood vessels, CSF compartments) as a surrogate of neurofluid dynamics. We found that 1) the manner biomechanical does not drive the variations in neurfluid dynamics across capnias; 2) besides respiration, cardiac pulsation also independently drives neurofluid flow as an indication of the ANS pathway of control; 3) changed CO2 alters neurofluid dynamics primarily through frequency rather than amplitude of heart-rate and respiratory-volume variability. These findings suggest that hyper- and hypocapnia both represent a disruption of homeostasis that engages ANS regulation, as reflected by the deviations in CRF and RRF from normocapnia. Our work demonstrates in awake humans previously reported ANS regulation observed during sleep. As basal CO2 can modulate this ANS regulation, it represents a new avenue for modulating neurofluid dynamics independently of sleep, attention or neuronal activation. More broadly, individuals with different basal capnic states may manifest differences in CSF dynamics, giving rise to a novel paradigm for modulating neurofluid flow in awake humans.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Yet, phenotypic and genotypic variation in parasites can shape their evolutionary trajectories and have important epidemiological consequences. Our aim was to determine whether the constraints associated with infecting different host tissues lead to the emergence and coexistence of multiple parasite sub-populations with distinct phenotypes. We tested this hypothesis using the most widespread bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia. We injected Wolbachia bacteria isolated from three tissues of the common pill-bug (Armadillidium vulgare) into uninfected individuals and monitored the growth rate and virulence of each bacterial sub-population in the new hosts. Our results highlight that within-host tissue heterogeneity leads to diverse Wolbachia phenotypes. High-depth genome re-resequencing of Wolbachia sub-populations revealed that this polymorphism was not due to genomic variation but was more likely a result of phenotypic plasticity. Indeed, we found no recurrent tissue-specific genomic variation among infected individuals. Our single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) filtration pipeline, developed to ensure SNP validity, detected only one substitution. This Wolbachia variant, observed in one female, was present in all three bacterial sub-populations, with frequencies ranging from 24% to 58% depending on the tissue. Overall, our results support the stability of the Wolbachia genome with respect to the rarity of point mutations, in agreement with reports from other symbiotic systems. From a methodological perspective, our study highlights the need for considerable caution when detecting variants in endosymbiont populations, as our conservative approach led us to exclude more than 99.5% of the initially called variants.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Urine and fecal deposits contain a variety of chemosensory signals that convey information about the individual's identity, genetic strain, social rank, and physiological or hormonal state. Furthermore, scent marking has been shown to be influenced by the social context and by the individual's internal state and experience. Therefore, analyzing scent-marking behavior during social interactions can provide valuable insight into the structure of mammalian social interactions in health and disease. However, conducting such analyses has been hindered by several technical challenges. For example, the widely used void spot assay lacks temporal resolution and is prone to artifacts, such as urine smearing. To solve these issues, recent studies employed thermal imaging for the spatio-temporal analysis of urination activity. However, this method involved manual analysis, which is time-consuming and susceptible to observer bias. Moreover, defecation activity was hardly analyzed by previous studies. In the present study, we integrate thermal imaging with an open-source algorithm based on a transformer-based video classifier for automatic detection and classification of urine and fecal deposits made by male and female mice during various social behavior assays. Our results reveal distinct dynamics of urination and defecation in a test-, strain- and sex-dependent manner, indicating two separate processes of scent marking in mice. We validate this algorithm, termed by us DeePosit, and show that its accuracy is comparable to that of a human annotator and that it is efficient in various setups and conditions. Thus, the method and tools introduced here enable efficient and unbiased automatic spatio-temporal analysis of scent marking behavior in the context of behavioral experiments in small rodents.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between the ERECTA (ER) receptor pathway and auxin signalling controls the amount and choice of output tissue in these two stem cell regions. Mechanistically, we show that the ER pathway phosphorylates the transcription factor AINTEGUMENTA, thereby modulating bilateral stem cell activity and favouring the differentiation of only one type of cell.

CCDC32 interacts with the alpha-appendage domain (AD) of AP2 in vitro and with full length AP2 complexes in cells. Deletion of aa78-98 in CCDC32, corresponding to a predicted alpha-helix, abrogates AP2 binding and CCDC32's early function in CME. Furthermore, clinically observed nonsense mutations in CCDC32, which result in C-terminal truncations that lack aa78-98, are linked to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS).

Scaffold RNAs (scRNAs) recruit dCas9 and an activator protein (RBP-AD) to the target gene for activation with high sequence specificity. Here, we show that, despite this specificity, orthogonal scRNAs interfere with each other because they compete for dCas9 and RBP-AD. Specifically, we demonstrate that the expression of an scRNA that binds to these resources results in repression of genes targeted by different scRNAs. Intriguingly, we also discover that transcriptional gene regulation by an scRNA is biphasic, wherein increased level of the scRNA leads to gene repression instead of activation. These effects are significant even when dCas9 and RBP-AD are expressed at the maximum level tolerable by the cell.

Sauvignon blanc were subjected to three ammonium nitrate treatments across three seasons, resulting in reduced esca incidence under nitrogen deficiency compared with medium nutrition levels, while excess nitrogen had no significant impact. Nitrogen treatments significantly impacted vine physiology and leaf metabolites but did not affect fungal wood communities. Nitrogen deficiency significantly reduced stem diameter, photosynthesis, and leaf area, likely decreasing whole-plant transpiration, while excess nitrogen increased these factors suggesting a key role of plant transpiration in esca incidence. Additionally, nitrogen deficiency led to significantly higher production of phenylpropanoids, particularly flavonoids, in leaf metabolomes compared to the medium level.

While conventional computational methods, such as molecular docking, have facilitated the discovery of potential hit compounds, the development of genome-wide virtual screening against the expansive chemical space remains a formidable challenge. Here we introduce DrugCLIP, a novel framework that combines contrastive learning and dense retrieval to achieve rapid and accurate virtual screening. Compared to traditional docking methods, DrugCLIP improves the speed of virtual screening by up to seven orders of magnitude. In terms of performance, DrugCLIP not only surpasses docking and other deep learning-based methods across two standard benchmark datasets, but also demonstrates high efficacy in wet-lab experiments. Specifically, DrugCLIP successfully identified agonists with < 100 nM affinities for 5HT2AR, a key target in psychiatric diseases. For another target NET, whose structure is newly solved and not included in the training set, our method achieved a hit rate of 15%, with 12 diverse molecules exhibiting affinities better than bupropion. Additionally, two chemically novel inhibitors were validated by structure determination with Cryo-EM. Finally, a novel potential drug target TRIP12, with no experimental structures and inhibitors for reference, was used to challenge DrugCLIP. DrugCLIP achieved a hit rate of 17.5% by screening a pocket identified on an AlphaFold2-predicted structure, verified with multi-cycle SPR assays. Molecules with the highest affinities also showed a dose-dependent inhibition to the enzymatic function of TRIP12. Building on this foundation, we present the results of a pioneering trillion-scale genome-wide virtual screening, encompassing approximately 10,000 AlphaFold2 predicted proteins within the human genome and 500 million molecules from the ZINC and Enamine REAL database.

Our E. coli-based reservoir computer (RC) consistently outperforms multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector machines (SVM), and achieves performance comparable to multilayer perceptron (MLP) across a range of regression and classification tasks.

Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found decodable information of the to-be-attended orientation during preparation; yet preparatory activity patterns were different from those evoked when actual orientations were perceived. When perturbing the neural activity by means of a visual impulse (\"pinging\" technique), the preparatory activity patterns in visual cortex resembled those associated with perceiving these orientations. The observed differential patterns with and without the impulse perturbation suggest a predominantly non-sensory format and a latent, sensory-like format of representation during preparation. Furthermore, the emergence of the sensory-like template coincided with enhanced information connectivity between V1 and frontoparietal areas and was associated with improved behavioral performance. By engaging this dual-format mechanism during preparation, the brain is able to encode both abstract, non-sensory information and more detailed, sensory information, potentially providing advantages for adaptive attentional control.

We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the ability of a recently developed model to recover co-occurrence estimates under varying sample size and interaction scenarios while increasing model complexity in two dimensions: the number of interacting species and the number of covariates. Using both standard and penalized likelihood, we demonstrate that the ability to quantify interactions in species occupancy using this model is highly sensitive to sample size, detection probability and interaction strength. In the simplest scenario, there is high bias in the interaction parameter (used for co-occurrence inference) with less than 100 sites at high detection, and 400-1000 sites at low detection, depending on interaction strength. Strong co-occurrence is detected consistently above 200 sites with high detection probabilities, but weak co-occurrence is never consistently detected even with 2980 sites. We demonstrate that mean predictive ability of the co-occurrence model is less affected by sample size, with low bias in derived probabilities at 50 sites. Our results highlight that while occupancy patterns are often robust to sample size limitations, reliable inference about co-occurrence demands substantially larger datasets than many studies currently achieve.

Here, we construct a population-based, layer-resolved connectivity map from EM data, taking into account the spatial scale of local cortical connectivity. We compare the obtained connectivity with a map based on an established LM data set. Simulating spiking neural networks constrained by the derived microcircuit architectures shows that both models allow for biologically plausible ongoing activity when synaptic currents caused by neurons outside the network model are specifically adjusted for every population. However, differentially varying the external current onto excitatory and inhibitory populations reveals that only the EM-based model robustly exhibits biologically plausible dynamics. Our work confirms the long-standing hypothesis that a preference of excitatory neurons for inhibitory targets, not present in the LM-based model, promotes balanced activity in cortical microcircuits.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We find that PCN is highly variable, spanning nearly three orders of magnitude, and that it is intrinsically robust against changes in genomic context. We further show that PCN variability is tightly associated with plasmid lifestyles, and propose the concept of replicon dominance to explain interactions in widespread multi-replicon plasmids. Finally, we uncover a universal scaling law that links copy number and plasmid size across bacterial species, indicating that pervasive constraints modulate the PCN-size trade-off.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

With the emergence of large datasets of melting temperatures for diverse natural proteins, it has become possible to train models to predict this quantity, and the literature has reported impressive performance values in terms of Spearman rho. The high correlation scores suggest that it should be possible to accurately predict melting temperature changes in engineered variants, and to reliably identify naturally thermostable proteins. However, in practice, results in these settings are often disappointing. In this paper, we explore this apparent discrepancy. We show that Spearman rho over cross-species data gives an overly optimistic impression of prediction performance, and that this metric reflects the ability to distinguish global differences in amino acid composition between species, rather than the specific effects of genetic variation. We proceed by investigating whether cross-species training on melting temperature is beneficial at all, compared to training specific models for each species. We address this question using four different transfer-learning approaches and a fine-tuning procedure. Surprisingly, we consistently find no benefit of cross-species training. We conclude that 1) current models for supervised prediction of melting temperature perform substantially worse than the literature suggests, and 2) that reliable transfer across species is still a challenging problem.

MmMYL3 directly binds the RGNNV capsid protein (CP), which dependents on the arm and S domains of CP and the EF-hand2 domain of MmMYL3.

BaGTA, encoded by all the pathogens of the genus Bartonella, is a chimeric GTA that evolved by the domestication of two phages. The run-off-replication module ROR of one phage is integrated with the capsid production, DNA packaging and lysis machinery Bgt of a second phage. Restricted to a self-sacrificing subset of the bacterial population, the position-specific DNA amplification and packaging of a genomic plasticity region enriched for genes involved in host interaction and adaptation selectively enhances the HGT frequency of these pathogenicity genes. This feature of BaGTA is considered a key innovation underlying the evolutionary success of Bartonella. Little is known, however, about the mechanism mediating the coordinated expression of the ror and bgt loci. Here, we established the regulatory hierarchy, with ror acting upstream of the capsid gene cluster bgtA-K. BrrG, encoded by the ror locus, controls the transcription of the bgtA-K operon by functioning as a processive antiterminator. This study provides the first insights into the mechanism controlling the coordinated expression of the two BaGTA modules of divergent phage origin. Beyond BaGTA, we propose that antitermination is a broadly relevant mechanism for controlling HGT by GTAs of the Alphaproteobacteria.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Inspired by the olfactory diagnostic capabilities of medical detection dogs, we do not reduce chromatograms to a list of compounds and concentrations. Instead, we deploy a machine learning approach that bypasses molecular identification: PCa \"scent character\" signatures are extracted from raw time series data transformed into image representations for classification via convolutional neural networks. To address confounding factors such as sample-source bias, we implement a multi-step pre-processing and debiasing pipeline, including empirical Bayes correction, baseline drift removal, and domain adversarial learning. The resulting model achieves classification performance on par with similarly trained canines, achieving a recall of 88% and an F1-score of 0.78. These findings demonstrate that, at least in the context of PCa detection from urine, machine learning-based scent signature analysis can serve as a fully non-invasive diagnostic alternative, with these early results being also relevant to the wider emergent field of medical machine olfaction.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Based on this observation, various methods have used SPRs to infer HGTs. We examine this apparent equivalence in the light of ghost lineages, i.e. related species absent from the phylogeny because they are extinct, unknown or have not been sampled. In this case an SPR is not directly interpretable by an HGT from the donor branch, because HGTs can have ghost lineages as donors. A possible and frequent interpretation - that we call \"induced HGT\" - is that the transferred gene leaves the sampled phylogeny for a ghost lineage at the donor branch, and is transferred back from a ghost lineage at the recipient branch. We show by simulations that this interpretation is misleading in a significant number of cases. For instance if the studied phylogeny represents 1% of all the species susceptible to exchange genetic material with the 100 sampled species, and 11 transfers occurred, then SPRs do not correspond to induced HGTs in around 50% of the cases. This leaves the question of a coherent interpretation of SPR in the presence of ghosts open, and applies to a certain extent to other phylogenetic simulation or inference methods of HGT, like reconciliation, or phylogenetic networks.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

The microsporidian Vavraia culicis, a potential biological control agent for mosquitoes, serves as an excellent model to explore such mechanisms. In this study, we investigate how infection by V. culicis lines that vary in virulence alters resource dynamics within the mosquito host Anopheles gambiae. Using metallomics and quantification of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content, we show that infection alters host resource concentrations in ways that depend on parasite virulence. More virulent parasites led to increased protein levels and greater energy demands, evidenced by higher carbohydrate reserves. Additionally, infection with V. culicis impacted host metal content, particularly zinc and manganese, used by V. culicis independently of its evolutionary background. Iron availability, a key nutrient for parasite growth, enhanced spore production, with selected parasite lines better able to exploit host iron than unselected.

Although the early subcortical stages of color vision are well characterised, the organization of cortical representations of color remain elusive, despite numerous models based on discrimination thresholds, appearance and categorization. An underexplored aspect of cortical color representations is their dynamic evolution. Here we compare the evolution of three different color representations over time using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We measured neural responses to 14 hues at each of 3 achromatic offsets (increment, isoluminant and decrement) while participants attended either to the exact color of the stimulus or its color category. We used a series of classification analyses, combined with multidimensional scaling (MDS) and Representational Similarity Analysis, to ask how cortical representations of color unfold over time from stimulus onset. We compared the performance of 'higher order' models based on hue and color category with a model based simply on stimulus cone contrast and found that all models had significant correlations with the data. However, the unique variance accounted for by each model revealed a dynamic change in hue responses over time, that was consistent with a 'coarse to fine' transition from a broad clustering into categorical groups to a finer within category representation. Notably, these dynamics were replicated across datasets from both tasks, suggesting they reflect a robust reorganization of cortical hue responses over time.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether response inhibition is associated with impulsive aggression and whether this relationship explains the effects of early-life social environments on impulsive aggression in juvenile Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica).

This study investigates the stereochemical outcomes of sarpagan bridge enzymes (SBEs) and rhazimal synthases (RHS), key players in geissoschizine cyclization and MIA diversification. Using two known and five newly identified enzymes from six plant species, we show that RHS enzymes from Alstonia scholaris, Vinca minor, and Amsonia tabernaemontana exclusively produce the 16R rhazimal stereoisomer.

Using SHAPE-MaP, we identified a 36-nucleotide hairpin (A+B) within DRAIC that is necessary and sufficient for its anti-oncogenic function. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirmed this hairpin physically interacts with the coiled coil domain of IKK. A+B RNA has a high binding affinity (KD [~]1-7 nM) to the coiled-coil domain of IKK. The binding of A+B disrupts the dimerization of NEMO and IKK coiled-coil domains, a critical step for IKK action. Consistent with this, A+B inhibits the phosphorylation of the NF-{kappa}B inhibitor I{kappa}B and suppresses NF-{kappa}B activity. Publicly available tumor RNAseq data revealed that alternative splicing modulates the presence of this critical hairpin: the inclusion of exon 4a (encoding one side of the A+B hairpin) in lung tumors correlates with reduced NF-{kappa}B activity. By demonstrating that the A+B hairpin is both necessary and sufficient to inhibit IKK and oncogenic phenotypes, this study underscores the centrality of IKK interaction and NF-{kappa}B inhibition in DRAIC-mediated cancer suppression and indicates that the activity of this lncRNA is regulated by alternative splicing.

We show that three prominent DRNDAT projections - to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala (CeA), and posterior basolateral amygdala (BLP) - play separable roles in behavior, despite substantial collateralization. Photoactivation of the DRNDAT-CeA projection promoted social behavior and photostimulation of the DRNDAT-BNST projection promoted exploratory behavior, while the DRNDAT-BLP projection supported place avoidance, suggesting a negative affective state. Downstream regions showed diverse receptor expression, poising DRNDAT neurons to act through dopamine, neuropeptide, and glutamate transmission. Furthermore, we show ex vivo that the effect of DRNDAT photostimulation on downstream neuron excitability depended on region and baseline cell properties, resulting in excitatory responses in BNST cells and diverse responses in CeA and BLP. Finally, in vivo microendoscopic cellular-resolution recordings in the CeA with DRNDAT photostimulation revealed a correlation between social behavior and neurons excited by social stimuli- suggesting that increased dopamine tone may recruit different CeA neurons to social ensembles.

This restricted coverage drives the emergence of non-vaccine serotypes. Moreover, vaccine efficacy is further compromised by immune evasion caused by capsule genotype (CapT) variations within vaccine-covered serotypes, while existing genome-based tools lack robust analytical capabilities for CapT. Results: We developed Pneumo-Typer, a CapT visualization tool enabling rapid identification of CapT variations in S. pneumoniae. Application to 17,407 publicly available genomes from the NCBI database revealed widespread CapT variations across vaccine-covered serotypes, providing critical insights for optimizing vaccine formulations. In addition, Pneumo-Typer integrates high-accuracy serotype prediction (98.44% accuracy across 93 serotypes) and multilocus sequence typing (ST), facilitating comprehensive genomic surveillance. Besides, CapT and ST information can assist in serotype determination. Pneumo-Typer enables integrated analysis of serotype-CapT-ST relationships, demonstrating that while most serotypes associate with multiple STs and CapTs, ST and CapT lineages evolve independently. Strikingly, multi-serotype serogroups exhibited pronounced CapT diversity, suggesting evolutionary processes driving serogroup expansion through CapT plasticity. Conclusions: In summary, Pneumo-Typer is an integrated platform for genomic surveillance of pneumococcal populations. By resolving previously underexplored serotype-CapT-ST linkages, the tool provides a framework for next-generation vaccine design, emphasizing the need for vaccine formulations that address both serotype replacement and CapT-driven immune evasion.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

The transition from adaptive to maladaptive avoidance remains poorly understood, but stress is a potential contributing factor. We investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress on two active avoidance procedures: two-way active avoidance (2WAA) and platform-mediated avoidance (PMA). Whereas 2WAA entails a low-cost response, avoidance in the PMA task comes with a cost, i.e., no access to food. We hypothesized that chronic restraint stress would hinder avoidance acquisition in the 2WAA task, but increase avoidance acquisition in the PMA task. In two experiments, male and female rats underwent either chronic restraint stress or a control procedure. In Experiment 1, all rats (N = 31) were then trained in a 2WAA acquisition and extinction procedure, in two contexts. Stressed rats showed significantly reduced avoidance acquisition, while extinction was unaffected. In Experiment 2 (N = 32), stressed rats and controls were trained in a PMA acquisition and extinction procedure. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find effects on avoidance acquisition, although we found group and sex differences in lever press suppression. All rats gradually extinguished defensive behaviors during extinction. Overall, chronic restraint stress had limited effects on PMA, but significantly impaired avoidance acquisition in the 2WAA task without affecting its extinction. These divergent effects may relate to differences in response cost or differences in safety of the context (i.e., a permanent safe area in PMA, but not in 2WAA).", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Persistent idiosyncrasies in behavioral phenotypes have been documented across animal taxa. These individual differences among organisms from the same genotype and reared in identical environments can result in phenotypic variability in the absence of genetic variation. While there is strong evidence to suggest that variability of traits can be heritable and determined by the genotype of an organism, little is known about how selection can specifically shape this heritable variance. Here, we describe a Python-based model of directional artificial selection for increasing the variability of a polygenic trait of interest. Specifically, our model focuses on variability in left-vs-right turn bias in\\textit{ D. melanogaster}. While the mean value of turn bias for a genotype is non-heritable and constant across genotypes, the variability of turn bias is a heritable and polygenic trait, varying dramatically among different genetic lines. Using our model, we compare different selection regimes and predict selection dynamics at population and genetic levels. We find that introducing population structure via a family-based selection regime can significantly affect selection response. When selection for increased variability is implemented on the basis of independently measured traits of individuals, the response is slower, but leads to a population with a greater genetic diversity. In contrast, when selection is implemented by measuring traits of families with half or full siblings, the response is faster, albeit with a reduced final genetic diversity in the population. Our model provides a useful starting point to study the effect of different selection regimes on any polygenic trait of interest. We can use this model to predict responses of laboratory-based selection experiments and implement feasible experiments for selection of complex polygenic traits in the lab.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

While these phenomena have been studied extensively with experiments and theory, the underlying principles for combining E and I inputs are still unclear. Here, rules for probabilistically combining E and I inputs are derived that describe how neurons in a feedforward inhibitory circuit respond to stimuli.

In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, germ cell-less (gcl) is required for the formation of primordial germ cells in the form of cells that cellularize at the posterior pole of the embryo, called pole cells. Forming pole cells is a mechanism of germ cell formation unique to a subset of insects. Even though most animals do not form pole cells as primordial germ cells, gcl is conserved across Metazoa, raising the question of how this conserved gene acquired its central role in the evolutionarily derived process of pole cell formation. Here, we examine the functions of gcl in two other insects with different modes of germ cell specification: the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus and the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. We found that gcl is involved in germ cell development, but not strictly required for germ cell specification, in O. fasciatus, although it appears to function through a mechanism different from that in D. melanogaster. In contrast, we could not detect any impact on the embryonic germ line upon gcl knockdown in G. bimaculatus.

However, the effects of different rates of pesticide application on soils remain poorly understood. This study investigates how abrupt versus gradual pesticide applications influence soil bacterial and fungal communities. Employing high-throughput sequencing, we examined the microbial diversity and community composition in response to ten commonly used pesticides. Bacterial communities exhibited minimal changes across treatments, whereas fungal communities responded strongly to pesticide exposure. Gradual applications reduced the relative abundance of dominant fungal taxa, resulting in an overall increase in community evenness. This effect was particularly pronounced for two herbicides and a triazole fungicide, which induced substantial shifts in fungal composition. Conversely, abrupt pesticide applications resulted in transient disruptions but did not promote the long-term proliferation of rare fungal phylotypes. These findings suggest that prolonged exposure to pesticides exerts strong selective pressures on fungi, potentially altering fundamental soil functions such as nutrient cycling and decomposition. Future research should focus on the long-term responses of soil microbial communities to pesticide application and the cumulative effects of chronic low-dose exposure, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how they shape microbial communities.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

A frontocentral ERP associated with reward feedback, the reward positivity (RewP), has been linked to reflect information about reward value and motivational states. It is, however, unclear if changes in the RewP are influenced by changes in reward value as a function of motivational state. To examine this, hungry participants (n=31) completed two rounds of a modified Doors Task incorporating Pavlovian conditioning during EEG recordings and obtained feedback associated with sweet and savory food reinforcers equally matched in pleasantness and desirability. Participants underwent reinforcer devaluation, a paradigm designed to isolate inference-based behavior based on decreasing reward value, in between rounds by eating one of the foods to satiety. Prior to devaluation, participants were hungry and rated both food reinforcers equally pleasant. After devaluation, participants were sated and rated the devalued food, but not the non-devalued food, significantly less pleasant, suggesting a sensory-specific change in reward value. Logistic regression of win-stay/lose-switch behavior during the Doors Task shows participants made sensory-specific adjustments in food preferences during post-devaluation. Non-parametric permutation tests based on the tmax statistic performed revealed no significant differences in RewP amplitudes, suggesting the RewP is insensitive to reinforcer devaluation. This could not be explained by differences in perceived pleasantness or desirability.

To better understand this cooperative effect, we propose a new physical quantity to evaluate the cooperativity of intermolecular interactions. Using H-bond aligned N-methylacetamide molecules as the model system, we assess the cooperativity of protein backbone hydrogen bonds using quantum chemistry (QM) calculations at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level, revealing cooperative energies ranging from 2 to 4.3 kcal/mol. A set of protein force fields was benchmarked against QM results. While the additive force field yielded null cooperativity, polarizable force fields, including the Drude and AMOEBA protein force fields, have been found to reproduce the trend of QM results, albeit with smaller magnitude.

However, the underlying empirical law, i.e., Kleibers law, according to which the metabolic rate scales with the mass to the power of 3/4, applies to all animals: for instance, flatworms with a most simple vascular system and a size slightly above the diffusion limit on growth show the same metabolic scaling as mammals. To date, there is no concise theory that is consistent with cell metabolism and compatible with physiological laws, e.g., that the volume flow scales with the capillary diameter to the power of three (Murrays law). In this papers we present how cell metabolism determines the scaling of the organisms metabolic rate via the Metabolic Module (MM), a cylinder formed by the organisms cells with a concentric capillary - sized and shaped with scarcity. Evolutionary changes from one taxonomic class to the next led to an unsteady increase in the number of MMs: the metabolism of protists and planarians, e.g., flatworms, is given by one MM only; for ectotherms, i.e., cold-blooded organisms, one thousand and for endotherms, i.e., warm-blooded organisms, nearly one hundred million MMs working together.

Patients who present with localized disease have experienced a steadily improving survival rate over the years, whereas those who present with metastatic disease or who develop metastatic relapse have the same dismal prognosis as 30 years ago, with long term survival rates less than 20%, despite maximal intensification of chemotherapy. Thus, novel treatment approaches are a significant unmet clinical need. Targeting metabolic differences between EWS and normal cells offers a promising approach to improve outcomes for these patients. One-carbon metabolism utilizes serine and dietary folate to generate glycine and tetrahydrofolate (THF)-bound one-carbon units, required for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis and NAD(P)H production. Elevated expression of several one-carbon metabolism genes is significantly associated with reduced survival in EWS patients. We show that both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of a key enzyme of the mitochondrial arm of the one-carbon metabolic pathway, serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), leads to substantial inhibition of EWS cell proliferation and colony-forming ability, and that this effect is primarily caused by depletion of glycine and one-carbon units required for synthesis of purine nucleotides. Inhibition of one-carbon metabolism at a different node, using the clinically relevant dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor Pralatrexate, similarly yields a profound growth inhibition, with depletion of thymidylate and purine nucleotides. Genetic depletion of SHMT2 dramatically impairs tumor growth in vivo, in a xenograft model of EWS. Together, these data establish the upregulation of the one-carbon metabolism as a novel and targetable vulnerability of EWS cells, which can be exploited for therapy.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Yet, how this affects mesoscale signal propagation within higher-order associative areas, crucially implicated in theories of consciousness, remains poorly understood. Here we combined intracortical microstimulation, and simultaneous multielectrode recordings in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of macaques across wakefulness, and graded depths of anaesthesia. Spiking responses revealed distinct regimes: in the PFC, higher-amplitude stimulation elicited a delayed single rebound after sustained inhibition, whereas in the PPC, a faster and double-rebound profile emerged. Despite enhanced local spiking and LFP responsivity under anaesthesia, we found a strong and selective suppression of lateral signal propagation in the PFC -- a breakdown strikingly absent in the PPC. This dissociation suggests that anaesthesia disrupts consciousness not merely by silencing cortical populations, but by impairing mesoscale integrative processes critical for neuronal dynamics at multiple scales.

Like their animal counterparts, SMCs undergo extensive structural and compositional changes in chromatin, initiated by the loss of linker histones, in a stepwise process. To investigate the role and mechanism of H1 eviction, we focused on two candidate pathways. Our findings show that specific point mutations, affecting either a putative citrullination site or ubiquitination site, prevent the eviction of H1.1 in the SMCs. Additionally, downregulation or chemical inhibition of the AIH citrulinase (Agmatine Imino Hydrolase) or of the E3-Ubiqtuitin ligase CULLIN4 also results in the persistence of H1.1 in SMCs. Notably, SMCs with impaired H1.1 eviction exhibit mild defects in chromatin reorganization and cell elongation. Despite these defects, the SMCs proceed through meiosis but fail to complete gametogenesis. Collectively, we propose a citrullination-ubiquitination pathway governing pre-meiotic H1 eviction as a critical mechanism for establishing post-meiotic competence in the Arabidopsis germline.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

In the presence of oxygen, PHD2 hydroxylates one or both conserved prolines in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of HIF subunits, sufficiently marking HIF for binding and ubiquitylation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, prolyl-hydroxylation in the C-terminal ODD appears to be the predominant and sufficient event in triggering the oxygen-dependent destruction of HIF, rendering the biological significance of N-terminal ODD proline unclear. Here, we examined 7 disease-associated EGLN1 mutations scattered across the catalytic core and show definitively that all PHD2 mutants have a structural and/or catalytic activity defect as measured by time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance. Notably, we identified one of the PHD2 mutants, P317R, to retain comparably wild-type capacity to hydroxylate the predominant proline in the C-terminal ODD but had uniquely compromised ability to hydroxylate the N-terminal ODD proline. These findings support the notion that deregulation of HIF ultimately underlies PHD2-driven erythrocytosis and challenge the currently held uncertainty that the N-terminal ODD prolyl-hydroxylation event is dispensable in normal hypoxic signaling pathway.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We found that neural trajectories derived from human neocortical responses show an orchestration of distinct coding strategies during naturalistic story comprehension. Neural latent geometry is primarily associated with syntactic relations and exhibits more efficient compression relative to lexical content. We further demonstrate that these trajectories can be simulated by brain-inspired computing systems with near-critical dynamics and a preference for historical information.

We present a structured approach to this sEEG testing, integrating a Stimulation Testing Decision Tree with power analysis and effect size considerations to inform adequately powered results to detect therapeutic stimulation sites with statistical rigor.\n\nResultsEffect sizes (Cohens d) of stimulation-induced symptom score changes ranged from approximately -1.5 to +3.0. The standard deviation of sham trial responses was strongly correlated with the standard deviation of stimulation responses (r=0.86, p < 0.001). Power analysis (using a paired-t test) showed that, for large effect sizes (>=1.1), around 10 trials should be used per stimulation site.

In the present study, to investigate the roles of low- and high-level statistical image features in natural scene and object recognition, we conducted categorization tasks using a wide variety of natural scene (250 images) and object (200 images) images, along with two types of synthesized images: Portilla-Simoncelli (PS) synthesized images, which preserve low-level statistical features, and style-synthesized (SS) images, which retain higher-level statistical features. Behavioral experiments revealed that observers could categorize style-synthesized versions of natural scene and object images with high accuracy. Furthermore, we recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for the original, SS, and PS images and decoded natural scene and object categories using a support vector machine (SVM). Consistent with the behavioral results, natural scene categories were decoded with high accuracy within 200 ms after the stimulus onset. In contrast, object categories were successfully decoded only from VEPs for original images at later latencies. Finally, we examined whether style features could classify natural scene and object categories. The classification accuracy for natural scene categories showed a similar trend to the behavioral data, whereas that for object categories did not align with the behavioral results. Taken together, these findings suggest that although natural scene and object categories can be recognized relatively easily even when layout information is disrupted, the extent to which statistical features contribute to categorization differs between natural scenes and objects.\n\nSignificance StatementHumans can reliably recognize complex natural scenes and objects. Recent studies have suggested that such recognition may rely on statistical image features, but the extent to which these features contribute to the recognition remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated how well statistical image features account for the perception of natural scenes and objects by conducting psychophysical categorization experiments and EEG decoding analyses. We found that natural scene categories could be reliably recognized based on statistical image features, and this recognition was consistent with neural responses. In contrast, although statistical image features also contributed to object category recognition, their effect appeared to be more limited.

Conceptually, characterization of inheritable SORL1 variants associated with AD can provide important new information about functions of this receptor relevant for aging brain health. Here, we focused on elucidation of the AD-associated variant SORLA N1358S, carrying a mutation in the main ligand binding domain of the receptor. Using unbiased quantitative proteome screens, we identified major alterations in the mutant receptor interactome linked to biogenesis and secretion of exosomes. Using advanced biophysical, cell biological, as well as functional studies in stem cell-derived human cell models we corroborated impaired release and loss of neurotrophic action of exosomes from neurons and microglia expressing SORLAN1358S. An impaired neurotrophic potential was attributed to an altered exosomal content of RNA binding proteins and associated microRNAs, known to control neuronal growth and maturation.

However, these factors often co-occur, making it difficult to disentangle their individual contributions. This study investigated how auditory emotional stimuli and attention-guided changes in luminance independently influence pupil dynamics. Participants were instructed to direct their visual attention to either white or black moving dot patterns, and to shift their attention upon the onset of an emotional sound. Pupil responses were z-normalized on a per-trial basis, and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) was recorded to verify attentional shifts. Results showed that emotional arousal robustly increased pupil size across conditions, while valence had no significant main effect. Pupil size was also modulated by the luminance of the attended stimulus, reflecting parasympathetic influences. No significant interaction between arousal and valence was observed, suggesting additive rather than interactive effects. These findings emphasize the methodological necessity of controlling attentional luminance in pupillometric studies and highlight the potential of pupil-based measures for emotion-aware system design. Crucially, because pupil dynamics reflect both luminance-guided attention and emotional arousal via distinct autonomic pathways, combining pupillometry with nonverbal indicators of attention--such as optokinetic nystagmus (OKN)--may enable the simultaneous estimation of attentional focus and emotional state in real time.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Adding a cerebrovascular component, in the form of arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion MRI, can improve the BAG predictions and potentially increase sensitivity to cardiovascular health, a contributor to brain ageing and cognitive decline. ASL acquisition differences are likely to influence brain age estimations, and data harmonisation becomes indispensable for multi-cohort brain age studies including ASL. In this multi-cohort, multi-sequence study, we investigate harmonisation methods to improve the generalisability of cerebrovascular brain age.\n\nMethodsA multi-study dataset of 2608 participants was used, comprising structural T1-weighted (T1w), FLAIR, and ASL 3T MRI data. The single scanner training dataset consisted of 806 healthy participants, age 50{+/-}17, 18-95 years. The testing datasets comprised four cohorts (n=1802, age 67{+/-}8, 37-90 years). Image features included grey and white matter (GM/WM) volumes (T1w), WM hyperintensity volumes and counts (FLAIR), and ASL cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its spatial coefficient of variation (sCoV). Feature harmonisation was performed using NeuroComBat, CovBat, NeuroHarmonize, OPNested ComBat, AutoComBat, and RELIEF. ASL-only and T1w+FLAIR+ASL brain age models were trained using ExtraTrees. Model performance was assessed through the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean BAG.\n\nResultsASL feature differences between cohorts decreased after harmonisation for all methods (p<0.05), mostly for RELIEF. Negative associations between age and GM CBF (b=-0.37, R2=0.13, unharmonised) increased after harmonisation for all methods (b<-0.42, R2>0.12) but weakened for RELIEF (b=-0.28, R2=0.14). In the ASL-only model, MAE improved for all harmonisation methods from 11.1{+/-}7.5 years to less than 8.8{+/-}6.2 years (p<0.001), while BAGs changed from 0.6{+/-}13.4 years to less than -1.03{+/-}7.92 years (p<0.001).\n\nFor T1w+FLAIR+ASL, MAE (5.9{+/-}4.6 years, unharmonised) increased for all harmonisation methods non-significantly to above 6.0{+/-}4.9 years (p>0.42) and significantly for RELIEF (6.4{+/-}5.2 years, p=0.02), while BAGs non-significantly differed from -1.6{+/-}7.3 years to between -1.3{+/-}4.7 and -2.0{+/-}8.0 years (p>0.82). In general, the ASL-specific parameter harmonisation method AutoComBat performed nominally best.\n\nDiscussionHarmonisation of ASL features improves feature consistency between studies and also improves brain age estimations when only ASL features are used. ASL-specific parameter harmonisation methods perform nominally better than basic mean and scale adjustment or latent-factor approaches, suggesting that ASL acquisition parameters should be considered when harmonising ASL data. Although multi-modal brain age estimations were improved less by ASL-only harmonisation, possibly due to weaker associations between age and ASL features compared to T1w features feature importance, studies investigating pathological ASL-feature distributions might still benefit from harmonisation. These findings advocate for ASL-parameter specific harmonisation to explore associations between cardiovascular risk factors, brain ageing, and cognitive decline using multi-cohort ASL and cerebrovascular brain age studies.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

While acute intoxication is known to produce heightened aggression, little is known about alcohols long-term effects. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that chronic alcohol intake can promote heightened aggression, including during abstinence and may also sensitize individuals to alcohols acute aggression-heightening effects.\n\nObjectivesThe goal of this study was to test the effects of chronic binge-like ethanol drinking on both alcohol-involved and alcohol-uninvolved aggression in male CFW mice. We aimed to model individual differences in binge drinking and assess changes in aggression during both acute and protracted abstinence.\n\nResultsAfter 5 weeks of Drinking in the Dark (DID), CFW mice that showed higher levels of EtOH drinking ( high drinkers, 1.33 g/kg/h) became more aggressive than low drinkers (0.45 g/kg/h) and H2O controls, as measured via frequency of attack bites during resident-intruder fighting. In the first aggressive encounter following 1 week of abstinence, animals with an alcohol drinking history initiate a fight more rapidly and with greater consistency than H2O controls. We also found that a single session of binge-like alcohol drinking acutely heightened aggression regardless of drinking history.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that repeated binge-like alcohol drinking causes escalations in alcohol-uninvolved aggression during acute (in high drinkers) and protracted abstinence (in all alcohol drinkers). However, chronic alcohol intake does not appear to sensitize animals to alcohol-involved aggression. These findings support the utility of genetically heterogeneous CFW mice for modeling individual variability in alcohol-related aggression.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Specifically, it focuses on a key characteristic of natural speech: the speech envelope. To achieve this, we employed two distinct measures. The first evaluates how effectively the patients brain activity \"tracks\" the speech envelope, called neural tracking. The second assesses the complexity of the brains responses to the speech stimulus, measured through spectral entropy. These two measures are then compared in their association with the patients clinical diagnosis and their level of behavioral responsiveness, both of which were assessed using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).\n\nDesignFour patients with DoC participated in this study, during which their brain activity was recorded using electroen-cephalography (EEG). At the same time, they listened to a narrated story in both Dutch and Swedish. Additionally, EEG baseline recordings were collected. We employed a backward modeling approach to evaluate the speech envelopes neural tracking. This technique involves training a model to map the relationship between EEG signals and the corresponding speech envelope. Once the model is trained, it can use unseen EEG data to reconstruct the speech envelope, which is then compared to the original speech envelope to assess how effectively the patient processed the auditory stimulus. For the behavioral assessment, we recalculated the CRS-R score of each patient into the CSR-R index, a more meaningful score that utilizes all the information contained in the CRS-R instead of only the highest scores on each subscale.\n\nResultsOur findings revealed positive correlations between spectral entropy and the CRS-R index, which were more pronounced during the listening conditions than the baseline. While neural tracking of the speech envelope did not correlate with the CRS-R index, it did exhibit a positive association with CRS-R diagnoses, indicating that patients with better clinical diagnoses demonstrated higher levels of neural tracking. Additionally, we identified an interaction effect between spectral entropy and neural tracking. Specifically, higher levels of neural tracking were associated with a stronger positive relationship between spectral entropy and the CRS-R index. In contrast, when neural tracking was lower, this relationship disappeared.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrated the potential of neural tracking and spectral entropy as complementary tools to investigate patients with DoC. Spectral entropy proved valuable for assessing behavioral responsiveness, while neural tracking shows promise in assessing the DoC diagnosis.

In two EEG experiments, we replicated this study while varying presentation time and task. Experiment 1 tested whether reducing stimulus presentation time from 1,450 ms to 100 ms altered neural representations of beauty. Experiment 2 examined whether beauty-related representations prevailed when participants performed an orthogonal task instead of explicitly judging beauty. Representational similarity analysis revealed that beauty-related neural representations emerged early (within 150 - 200 ms post-stimulus) and were sustained over time, in line with previous findings. Critically, we found that neither reduced presentation time nor the absence of an explicit beauty judgment significantly altered beauty-related neural dynamics.

The molecular mechanisms driving this shift remain largely unexplored. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-Seq) across developmental retinal neurogenesis in the 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) to uncover the regulatory basis of this adaptation. We find that 13LGS cone photoreceptors arise not only from early-stage neurogenic progenitors, as seen in rod-dominant species like mice, but also from late-stage neurogenic progenitors. This extended period of cone generation is driven by a heterochronic shift in transcription factor expression, with cone-promoting factors such as Onecut2, Pou2f1, and Zic3 remaining active in late-stage progenitors, and factors that promote cone differentiation such as Thrb, Rxrg, and Mef2c expressed precociously in late-stage neurogenic progenitors. Functional analyses reveal that Zic3 and Mef2c are sufficient to promote cone photoreceptor and respress rod specification, and act through species-specific regulatory elements that drive their expression in late-stage progenitors.

Here, we identified and described phosphatase labile physiological PS129 in the mammalian brain using a range of specimens from rodent to human surgically resected temporal lobectomy tissues. Results confirmed phosphatase-sensitive physiological PS129 in the non-synucleinopathy human temporal lobe and hippocampus when the post-mortem interval was eliminated (i.e., surgically resected human samples or perfusion-fixed animal brain). In the non-synucleinopathy mammalian brain, PS129 fluctuated between 2-45% of the total asyn pool in a case-specific and brain region-specific manner. In agreement with previous studies, physiological PS129 was abundantly distributed throughout the layers of the hippocampus and cortex. Physiological PS129 was not observed in PD brain, or non-synucleinopathy specimens of >2h post-mortem interval. Remarkably, in the PD brain, the PS129 to asyn ratio was similar ([~]5-40%) to that in the non-synucleinopathy brain. Despite physiological PS129 being associated with neuronal activity, physiological PS129 did not correlate with cFos expression. Conclusions: Physiological PS129 is abundant in the human brain, and apparent pathological enrichment, in part, can be explained by the enzymatic resistance of aggregates and not disease-driven phosphorylation events.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

So far, investigations of fetal brain responses to sensory information have mostly relied on cryogenic magnetoencephalography (MEG), which is suitable to record fetal brain activity and is not much affected by layers of maternal tissues. Nevertheless, this solution is extremely expensive and limited to a couple of laboratories worldwide. In this work, we took advantage of the next generation cryogenic-free MEG, that is MEG based on optically pumped magnetometers (OPM), to develop a system that could record both fetal and newborn brain responses to auditory stimulation in a longitudinal design. Twenty-one pregnant women in their late third trimester of gestation (35-40 weeks of gestational age) were exposed to sequences of 500 Hz tones. Fetal brain activity was recorded using a wearable belt equipped with OPM sensors arranged on the womens abdomen based on fetal head position. Results revealed that fetal OPM-MEG successfully recorded significant evoked brain responses to auditory stimuli that peaked ~300 ms post-stimulus at the group level. A similar auditory paradigm was performed with on-scalp OPM-MEG in 14 one-month-old infants, with 9 participants common to both timepoints. Infant responses showed a significant latency decrease compared to the fetal ones in terms of magnetometers; a decrease that did not reach significance level for virtual gradiometers. This work demonstrates the ability of OPM-MEG to non-invasively record fetal brain responses to external sensory stimuli. It paves the way for a wider use of fetal MEG to investigate fetal cognition and positions OPM-MEG as the most promising lifespan-compliant solution for monitoring early brain development.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated how CRF modulates cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsal striatum, a region critical for mediating cognitive flexibility and action selection. Using monosynaptic and retrograde circuit tracing, we identified direct inputs from CRF-expressing (CRF) neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to dorsal striatal CINs. We showed that CINs express CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) and established their functional connectivity with CeA/BNST CRF projections. Functional recordings revealed that CRF enhanced CIN excitability and promoted acetylcholine release in the dorsal striatum. However, acute alcohol exposure and withdrawal attenuated the excitatory effect of CRF on CIN firing, suggesting a mechanism by which alcohol disrupts CRF-dependent neuromodulation.

However, the precise role of GABAergic transmission in the SCN remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the GABAergic regulation from arginine vasopressin (AVP)-producing neurons in the SCN shell to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-producing neurons in the SCN core. Blocking GABA release from AVP neurons by a vesicular GABA transporter (Vgat) gene deletion lengthened the activity time (the interval between the onset and offset of locomotor activity) and shortened the duration of high Ca2+ activity in VIP neurons to match the behavioral rest time. Conversely, eliminating functional GABAA receptors (GABAAR) in VIP neurons by in vivo genome editing reduced locomotor activity level and the activity time, and lengthened the high Ca2+ duration in VIP neurons. Optogenetic activation of AVP neurons in vivo increased Ca2+ in VIP neurons during the night. A similar Ca2+ response of VIP neurons to AVP neuronal activation was also observed in SCN slices and was inhibited by a GABAAR antagonist, gabazine. Importantly, gabazine application alone raised the baseline Ca2+ in VIP neurons, suggesting a tonic depression of these neurons by GABA. Moreover, AVP neuronal activation decreased Ca2+ in non-AVP neurons located between AVP- and VIP-rich regions in the SCN. These results suggest that GABA from AVP neurons disinhibits VIP neurons indirectly by suppressing other intermediate GABA neurons to set the behavior activity/rest time precisely.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

This sensorimotor loop is constrained by time delays that impose a trade-off between responsiveness and stability. Additionally, as the relationship between a motor command and the corresponding sensory feedback is context dependent, the response must be adapted in real time. It is generally believed that this adaptation process relies on an internal model that is continuously updated through prediction error minimization. Here, we experimentally reveal an alternative strategy based on a simpler feedback mechanism that does not require any internal model. We developed a virtual reality system for the miniature transparent fish Danionella cerebrum that enables in vivo brain-wide imaging during fictive navigation. By systematically manipulating the feedback parameters, we dissected the motor control process that allows the animal to stabilize its position using optic flow. The sensorimotor loop can be fully described by a single delay differential equation, whose solutions quantitatively capture the observed behavior across all experimental conditions. Both behavioral and neural data indicate that the observed adaptive response arises from the logarithmic nonlinearities at the sensory (Weber-Fechner law) and motor (Henneman's size principle) ends. These fundamental properties of the nervous system, conserved across species and sensory modalities, have traditionally been interpreted in terms of efficient coding. Our findings unveil a distinct functional role for such nonlinear transformations: ensuring stability in sensorimotor control despite inherent delays and sensory uncertainty.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of SLC1A4-related disorders, we utilized human iPSC-derived hippocampal neurons and applied an integrated multi-omics approach, combining electrophysiology, calcium imaging, metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics. Our findings reveal an initial phase of early neuronal hyperexcitability, driven by increased sodium and potassium currents, followed by a progressive decline in synaptic activity at later stages. Metabolomic analysis identified elevated glycine, serine, and glutamate levels during early differentiation, contributing to excitotoxicity, whereas later glutamate depletion and extracellular matrix (ECM) disruption were associated with synaptic dysfunction. Proteomics data further showed dysregulation in metabolic pathways, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid metabolism pathways during early time points, and in later stage dysregulation in metabolic and ECM-receptor interactions. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation in calcium signaling, amino acid metabolism pathways such as valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, tryptophan metabolism, and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. Further investigation of SLC-family transporter genes uncovered disruptions in glutamate and glycine transport, establishing a direct link between amino acid transport dysfunction and neuronal deficits. Collectively, our study demonstrates that SLC1A4 mutations lead to dysregulation of multiple solute carrier protein genes causing metabolic stress, excitability defects, and synaptic abnormalities, providing a molecular framework for understanding SLC1A4-related neurodevelopmental disorders and identifying potential therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

PIC-MIA disrupted the developmental regulation of synapse-related genes and of genes implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Genomic regions that gain or lose DNA methylation during normal development were altered following PIC-MIA, including neurodevelopmental transcription factor binding sites. The DNA methylation and transcriptional changes were consistent with a delay in excitatory neuron maturation.

By integrating transcriptomic (microarray data and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing [sn-RNA] data), molecular imaging, and neuroimaging datasets, we present converging evidence that the spatial distribution of diverse cell types, neurotransmitter systems, and mitochondrial phenotypes are systematically aligned with intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs)-the macroscale scaffolding of brain function. These associations extend beyond local correspondence to reflect network-level structure: inter-ICN similarity networks derived from cellular and molecular profiles significantly recapitulate both static and dynamic patterns of functional network connectivity (FNC), mirroring the established division of ICNs into canonical functional domains. Importantly, these cellular and molecular profiles not only co-localize with ICNs and FNC but also appear to support their role as intermediaries linking microscale biological substrates to cognitive function. Mediation analyses reveal that specific ICNs statistically mediate the relationship between microscale cell-type architecture and domain-specific cognitive and behavioral processes. Moreover, dynamic FNC, particularly in specific transient states, captures the mediating pathways linking cell-type and neurotransmitter similarity networks to cognitive network organization. Taken together, our findings suggest that the brain's functional architecture is systematically aligned with cellular and molecular organization, which may act as a biological constraint guiding functional network formation and shaping the neural basis of cognition.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

To investigate, we recorded neural signals from inferotemporal cortex (ITC) and HC of two rhesus monkeys as they performed a memory task in which they judged whether images were novel or exactly repeated in the presence of visually similar lure images with a range of visual similarities. We found behavioral evidence for sharpening, reflected as memory performance that was nonlinearly transformed relative to a benchmark defined by visual representations in ITC. As expected, we found that behavioral sharpening aligned with visual memory representations in HC. Surprisingly, and unaccounted for by HC pattern separation proposals, we also found neural correlates of behavioral sharpening reflected in ITC. These results, coupled with further analysis of the data, suggest that ITC contributes to shaping the fidelity of visual memory in the transformation from visual processing to memory storage and signaling.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Using repeated pulses of blue light (5 seconds, {lambda} = 430 - 495nm at 19 mW, ~2.4 mW/mm2) on cortical slices, we observed a robust and sustained decrease in evoked firing activity, approximately 60% relative to baseline, in cortical neurons from both male and female mice. This inhibitory effect persisted for more than twenty minutes following stimulation. In human cortical slices, the effect was more variable. While some neurons showed reduced activity, others, particularly those from female subjects, exhibited increased firing in response to light. The long-lasting modulation of neuronal excitability appears to result from changes in both the passive (membrane resistance and resting potential) and active (voltage-dependent Na and K channels) properties of neurons. These findings suggest that visual light stimulation may serve as a tool to treat brain pathologies produced by neuronal hyperexcitability. We propose a roadmap for further research, including in vivo validation, exploration of stimulation parameters, and evaluation in pathological models.

J.", "abstract": "The modulatory neurotransmitter norepinephrine and activation of {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}-ARs) has a crucial role in hippocampus-dependent forms of learning. Although {beta}-AR activation also facilitates the induction of Hebbian LTP at excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, recent findings indicate that a non-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity, known as behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), underlies hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. Because little is known about the role of noradrenergic signaling in BTSP, I examined the effects of the {beta}-AR activation on a BTSP-like, complex spike (CS) burst-dependent form of LTP induced by theta-pulse stimulation (TPS) protocols in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices. I find that {beta}-AR activation not only enhances the homosynaptic potentiation of synaptic transmission induced by TPS but also regulates how synapses interact during the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP. The ability of synapses to interact in a cooperative fashion to undergo CS burst-dependent LTP, which is mediated by a heterosynaptic facilitation of EPSP-evoked CS bursting induced by brief trains of TPS, was enhanced by {beta}-AR activation. Moreover, unlike conventional Hebbian LTP, where cooperative LTP induction requires near synchronous coactivation of synapses, {beta}-AR activation enabled the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP by cooperative interactions between synapses activated up to ten seconds apart. {beta}-AR activation also enhanced a potent form of synaptic competition that emerges during longer trains of TPS. This effect of {beta}-AR activation is mediated by a CS burst-dependent form of heterosynaptic depression and produces an unusual, bidirectional modulation of LTP induction where the {beta}-AR-mediated facilitation of homosynaptic LTP induction produces a heterosynaptic suppression of LTP induction at other synapses. Together, these findings indicate that {beta}-AR activation regulates fundamental properties of postsynaptic burst-dependent plasticity rules by modulating multiple forms of heterosynaptic plasticity.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Forty-three (43) patients with CAD and 36 HC aged 50 and older underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and multi-modal 3T MRI. A novel multivariate approach - the Mahalanobis distance (D2) - was used to quantify WM abnormalities as the amount of deviation from the HC reference group. D2 integrates multiple MRI-derived diffusion-weighted imaging, R1 relaxometry, and magnetization transfer imaging metrics, while accounting for covariance between metrics. Relationships between WM D2 and cognition (executive function and processing speed) were also assessed. Compared to HCs, patients with CAD had higher D2 values in the whole WM (p=0.009) and in the territories right anterior, bilateral middle, and right posterior cerebral artery territories (p<0.05). Myelin-sensitive metrics, particularly R1 relaxation rate and MT saturation (MTsat), were the most important contributors to D2. Processing speed was positively associated with greater R1 in both the whole WM and left middle cerebral artery territory. These findings suggest that greater WM microstructural alterations observed in patients with CAD were mainly driven by differences in myelin content, as R1 and MTsat were the most important contributors.

Twenty-five participants (aged 18 to 78) were tested in a modified Sternberg task with text-based visual words.

Results showed separate effects of high-frequency hearing sensitivity and age on visual cortical responses. At scalp sensors, visual N1 amplitudes were larger with worse hearing sensitivity, and P2 latencies were longer. In contrast, age was associated with shorter P2 latencies. Source analysis found that N1 amplitude increased with worse hearing sensitivity in right auditory cortex, but no effects were found in visual cortex, or for age. Hearing sensitivity and visual encoding activity did not correlate with behavioural performance or neural oscillations during the retention period.

However, analysis of gene ontology terms assigned to the generation-biased/generation-specific genes indicated that each generation (i.e. the sporophyte and the gametophyte) also has characteristic broad life-cycle-related features that have been conserved during evolution. A more detailed analysis of Ectocarpus species 7, identified progressive transcriptome changes over its entire life cycle with a particularly marked change in transcriptome composition during the first day of sporophyte development, characterised by downregulation of flagellar and transcription factor genes and upregulation of a subset of translation genes. Comparison with a similar transcriptomic time series for the evolutionarily-distant (about 250 My) brown alga Dictyota dichotoma indicated considerable conservation of co-expressed gene modules between the two species, particularly for modules that were enriched in genes assigned to evolutionarily-conserved functional categories. This study therefore identified broad life-cycle- and development-related patterns of gene expression that are conserved across the brown algae.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

D.; Drummond-Barbosa, D.", "abstract": "Unhealthy diets, obesity, and low fertility are associated in Drosophila and humans. We previously showed that a high sugar diet, but not obesity, reduces Drosophila female fertility owing to increased death of newly formed germline cysts and vitellogenic follicles. Drosophila strains carrying mutations in the yellow (y) and white (w) pigmentation genes are routinely used for investigating the effects of high sugar diets, but it has remained unclear how this genetic background interacts with high sugar. Here, we show that wildtype females retain normal fertility on high sugar compared to control diets, and that mutation of y is responsible for the previously observed vitellogenic follicle death on high sugar. The known requirement of y for melanin biosynthesis from dopamine, as well as the association between high sugar consumption and reduced dopamine in mammals and decreased dopamine responses in male Drosophila, prompted us to investigate potential connections between y, high sugar, dopamine and oogenesis. We found that global impairment of dopamine metabolism leads to vitellogenic follicle degeneration while alleviating dopamine imbalance in y mutant females prevents follicle death on a high sugar diet. Finally, lack of dopamine production in the central nervous system is sufficient for vitellogenic follicle death on a high sugar diet, and severe dopamine imbalance causes follicle death regardless of diet or genetic background. Our findings are broadly relevant to our understanding of how the effects of unhealthy diets might differ depending on genetic factors and highlight a key connection between brain dopamine metabolism and ovarian follicle survival.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "BackgroundFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) describes a spectrum of ethanol-induced neural and facial developmental defects. Ethanol susceptibility is modulated by genetics, but their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In all vertebrates, a series of complex cellular events give rise to the body plan, including convergence & extension (C&E) and endoderm/ cranial neural crest (CNC-which gives rise to the facial skeleton) morphogenesis. These events are critical to establish complex signaling interactions, driving embryo development, including the facial skeleton. In zebrafish, C&E occurs between 6-10 hpf while endoderm/CNC morphogenesis occurs 10-24 hpf. Previous work shows that the PCP mutants are sensitive to ethanol from 6-24 hpf, covering both C&E and endoderm/CNC morphogenesis and exhibiting multiple defects to the forming head raising the question whether ethanol during both time windows drives PCP-ethanol defects. We hypothesize that PCP single and double mutants are ethanol sensitive 10-24 hpf, after C&E. We also hypothesize BMP signaling (sensitive 10-18 hpf) interacts with and sensitizes the PCP pathway to ethanol.\n\nMethodsHere, we treated PCP/BMP mutants with ethanol from 6-10, 10-18, 10-24 or 24-30 hpf and combined morphometric and linear measurements to examine facial development.\n\nResultsWe show that PCP mutant larvae are ethanol-sensitive from 10-24 hpf, but not 6-10 or 24-30 hpf. We also show that BMP mutants sensitize PCP mutants to ethanol and lead to novel ethanol-independent midline craniofacial defects. Our results suggest that the ethanol-sensitive role of PCP pathway occurs after C&E, during endoderm/CNC morphogenesis and that the PCP and BMP pathways genetically interact during the morphogenesis events.\n\nConclusionsUltimately, our work builds on a mechanistic paradigm of ethanol-induced birth defects we have been developing, connecting conceptual framework with concrete cellular events that could be ethanol-sensitive beyond facial development.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

The spine contains a number of ligaments that predominantly function in mechanical stabilisation and allow for certain ranges of spinal motion. Establishment of mechanical stability provided by spinal ligaments has not been described, and it is not known to what extent failure or inadequate spinal ligaments contribute to spinal conditions, such as scoliosis. While there are many similarities between ligaments and tendons, there is no experimental evidence investigating the development of these stability bearing tissues. This study uses the embryonic chick model Gallus gallus and investigates the development of spinal ligaments in the thoracic spine, examining structure and molecular expression across development. Findings show organisational changes in spinal ligaments in association with vertebral shape changes from cranial to caudal, with the anatomical identification of six vertebral ligaments in the thoracic spine. As development proceeds the size of the anterior longitudinal ligament, on the ventral surface of the vertebral body, and the supraspinous ligament, on the dorsal side of the spine, becomes greater, with the orientation of collagen fibres in the supraspinous ligament becoming more aligned. In addition, this study demonstrates that cell density decreases and nuclei become smaller and more circular across development. This study provides evidence that the embryonic chick is an appropriate model to study spinal ligament development and has added knowledge on the structural hallmarks of embryonic vertebral ligament tissues. These findings allow for subsequent investigation of the mechanical and molecular characteristics of spinal ligament development, for example useful for determining if in utero movement is important for the establishment of spinal ligament stability. Use of this model and integration of findings with additional models will provide knowledge of the contribution of spinal ligaments in spinal failure conditions.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

This study investigates genetic extinction debt and colonization credit in Circaea lutetiana, a clonal forest understory species, across its European range. Using pooled genotype-by-sequencing data from 40 forest edge and core populations, we examined to what extent population size, latitude and historical changes in forest configuration predict genetic diversity. Our findings reveal that the historical forest configuration profoundly shapes present-day genetic diversity. Long-established forest edge populations exhibit significantly reduced allelic richness (-9%) compared to core populations, indicating the partial pay-off of a genetic extinction debt. In contrast, populations from recently established forest edges maintain comparable allelic richness to core populations, suggesting delayed population genetic responses to land use changes. Finally, populations established in areas that were afforested during the past 250 years exhibit lower genetic diversity than historical forest core populations, indicating a delay in genetic recovery and thus a potential genetic colonization credit. Our results highlight that C. lutetiana populations are not at equilibrium with the current forest configuration, underscoring the role of lagged genetic responses across very long time scales. Connectivity and population size further moderate genetic diversity, with smaller, isolated populations particularly vulnerable to genetic erosion.

We selected three oak trees for each of the three treatments for biogeochemical monitoring: 1. No symptoms (Healthy), 2. AOD & 3. COD symptoms, in Writtle woodlands, Essex, UK. The selected trees were used for quarterly root zone soil sampling (cores to depth of 40 cm), and monthly surface soil (0-10 cm), leaf litter and GHG emissions sampling over a year (2022-23). Soil samples were characterised for their physico-chemical properties, total nutrient content & availability. Leaf litter samples were sorted into branches, leaves, seeds and flowers, weighed and their chemistry characterised. Soil microbial communities were characterised using phospholipid fatty acid analyses. Almost all the measured properties showed significant changes with season and depth, indicating a strong temporal and depth effect on forest soil biogeochemical dynamics. Notably macro-nutrient contents of leaf litter were greater in the summer period, which resulted in increased soil nutrient availability in autumn. This pattern was particularly exaggerated in AOD trees, which had greater nutrient content in litterfall in summer and greater nutrient availability in root zone soil in autumn than those of COD and Healthy trees. We found that AOD root zone soil have altered microbial communities, decreased CO2 emissions and increased macronutrient availability. Taken together, our study shows poor physiological nutrient management by diseased AOD trees revealed by greater nutrient concentration in AOD leaf litter indicating the lack of nutrient resorption and re-allocation before leaf senescence, and less active root zone soil under AOD trees, shown by reduced soil CO2 emissions and increased nutrient availability in oak root influenced zones. Hence, we conclude that the biogeochemical dynamics of AOD root zone soils are significantly different to that of healthy and COD trees, however controlled experiments are needed alongside these field observations to disentangle the causes from effects in understanding the relationship between soil health and oak decline.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe monitored forest soil biogeochemical dynamics under oak trees of different health status\nC_LIO_LIAcute Oak Decline (AOD) trees had greater macronutrient availability in root zone soils\nC_LIO_LIAOD trees had greater nutrient content in litter added to the root zone soil\nC_LIO_LIAOD root zone soils had altered microbial community structure & reduced CO2 emissions\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that AOD trees have poor physiological nutrient management and less active rhizosphere compared to healthy trees.\nC_LI", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

S.; Joshi, A.", "abstract": "Density-dependent selection has been widely studied in D. melanogaster in the context of larval crowding, revealing its impact on several life-history traits. However, the effects of adult crowding in Drosophila have not been studied in similar detail. Earlier studies on adult crowding have primarily used large flies (reared at low larval density). These gave rise to the notion that adult crowding negatively affects key fitness components such as mortality and fecundity. Earlier work from our lab showed that body size significantly alters how flies respond to a relatively short period of adult crowding. Large flies show increased mortality and decreased fecundity with increased adult density. In contrast, small flies (reared at high larval density) tolerate adult crowding better, showing increased fecundity with increased adult density. Here, we extend this line of work by investigating how air volume in a culture vial can influence the effects of adult crowding. We manipulated air volume by altering the vial diameter (thereby also the food surface area), or the height of the air column. Flies of different body sizes were generated by rearing them at low or high larval densities. We find that the surface area of food available to the adults plays a greater role in shaping the outcome of adult crowding than the height of the air column. Large flies displayed context-dependent responses to adult crowding that were driven by the surface area of food provided. Small flies consistently responded positively to adult crowding in all conditions, with low mortality and increased fecundity at high adult density. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the body size, absolute density and the food surface area available to the flies and their nuanced interactions while exploring the effects of adult crowding, and thus paves the way for a detailed examination of other factors that impact adult crowding in addition to just the overall density.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

R.; Asch, P. A.; Glavis-Bloom, C.", "abstract": "Relational memory, the ability to flexibly encode and retrieve associations among distinct elements, is critically dependent on the hippocampus and declines with age in humans. The Transverse Patterning (TP) task is designed to probe relational memory by requiring learning of hierarchical, circular stimulus relationships (e.g., A+ B-, B+ C-, C+ A-), a structure akin to rock-paper-scissors. In humans, TP performance is reliably impaired by hippocampal damage and aging. In non-human primates, however, findings have been inconsistent with some studies demonstrating clear hippocampal dependence, while others report no impairment, or even improvements, following hippocampal lesions. This raises the possibility that species differences in cognitive strategy use may underlie these divergent outcomes. We hypothesized that non-human primates rely on an elemental learning strategy, supported by corticostriatal systems, even when relational memory is required. To test this, we trained young and aged common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) on the TP task and several control tasks designed to isolate elemental versus configural learning. Marmosets successfully acquired reward contingencies for individual stimulus pairs but failed when success required integrating all three stimulus relationships. In contrast, all animals readily acquired control tasks solvable via simple stimulus-response associations. Notably, there was no evidence of age-related impairment on TP or control task performance. Given the early vulnerability of the hippocampus to aging and the relative preservation of striatal systems, this pattern further supports the conclusion that marmosets rely on a habit-based learning strategy that is poorly suited to relational demands. These findings suggest that humans and non-human primates may approach the same tasks using different cognitive strategies. This has critical implications for interpreting cross-species differences in memory performance and highlights the need to validate which neural systems a task engages in each species before using it as a translational model of hippocampal function or cognitive aging.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We performed bulk segregant analysis using the recombinant inbred lines that exhibited extreme chill coma recovery time to identify genomic regions responsible for the phenotype.

However, the frequency and fixation of the purple morph systematically increased towards the rural end of the gradient. Although lifetime seed production did not vary among morphs, pre-dispersal seed predation by a recently adventive weevil was higher in the purple morph, particularly in rural areas. Estimated seed production in the absence of predation suggests a previous fitness advantage for the purple and pink morphs in rural areas and for the white morph in urban areas.\n\nConclusionsRandom variation in flower color diversity may be influenced by stochastic processes and colonization history, while systematic variation in color morph frequencies may reflect past fitness differences among morphs that have been recently erased by seed predation.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Aulactinia stella is a keystone tetraploid circumpolar sea anemone species that is witnessing these changes. Here, we investigated how reproduction and genetic diversity structured in A. stella populations and between adults and juveniles sampled across the Arctic Ocean.\n\nOutside Kamchatka, we only found females or individuals without gonads. Genetic indices and changes in genotype frequencies confirmed that this species reproduces partially by parthenogenesis. Populations on the Atlantic side were highly clonal, while those on the Pacific side reproduced more sexually. Allelic diversity was twice as high in Kamchatka and Kuril populations, suggesting North Pacific coasts being the main last glacial refugia of A. stella. Patterns of genetic differentiation between site pairs revealed gene flow routes extending from Kamchatka to Atlantic populations. These routes aligned with ocean currents and reduced sea ice, and not with the past maritime exchanges between Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nWithin each population, only a subset of juvenile genetic diversity, mostly of local origin, was represented among established adults, suggesting local adaptation or kin recognition mechanisms promoting endemism.

Our analysis confidently identified 224 proteins in the foam using 32 pooled samples from 96 males. 96.4% of proteins had orthologs in the closely related (diverged 35 million years ago) chicken (Gallus gallus) which generated 40 Gene Ontology terms.

In holometabolous insects, the dynamic expression of genes enables distinct functional adaptations at embryonic, larval, pupal and adult stages, likely contributing to their evolutionary success. While Drosophila melanogaster has been extensively studied, less is known about the evolutionary dynamics that could govern stage-specific gene expression. To address this question, we compared the distribution of stage-specific genes, i.e., genes expressed in temporally restricted developmental stages, across development of D.melanogaster and Aedes aegypti. Using tau-scoring, a computational method to determine gene expression specificity, we found that, on average, a large proportion of genes (20 to 30% of all protein-coding genes) in both species exhibit restricted expression to specific developmental stages. Phylostratigraphy analysis, a method to date the age of genes, further revealed that stage-specific genes fall into two major categories: highly conserved and recently evolved. Notably, many of the recently evolved and stage-specific genes identified in A.aegypti and D.melanogaster are restricted to Diptera order (20 to 35% of all stage-specific genes), highlighting ongoing evolutionary processes that continue to shape life-stage transitions. Overall, our findings underscore the complex interplay between gene evolutionary age, expression specificity, and morphological transformations in development. These results suggest that the attraction of genes to critical life stage transitions is an ongoing process that may not be constant across evolutionary time or uniform between different lineages, offering new insights into the adaptability and diversification of dipteran genomes.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Given this, we hypothesised that the pharmacokinetics, the temporal changes of drug concentrations under treatment, could impact persister formation. We predicted that the longer bacteria spend under sublethal drug concentrations, the more persisters would form. Using a set-up with small chemostats and the antimicrobial peptide Pexiganan, we indeed found that faster pharmacokinetics resulted in lower persister numbers compared to slower pharmacokinetics.

Four-taxon tests for introgression provide a reliable framework for detecting signatures of ancient introgression from genomic data, which have played an important role in revealing the reticulate nature of plant evolution; however, there is emerging evidence that a cryptic process known as ghost lineage introgression has the potential to dramatically skew interpretations of four-taxon introgression statistics, particularly our ability to determine the lineages involved in introgression. This ambiguity limits our ability to resolve the mechanisms and functional implications of introgression because it means we can determine neither the donor nor the recipient of introgressed alleles with confidence. Methods: Here, we develop ghostbuster, a statistical test designed to detect ghost lineage introgression in genomic data based on patterns of sequence divergence. We employ coalescent simulations to test our method and ascertain the conditions under which it accurately identifies ingroup versus ghost lineage introgression. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of ghostbuster we apply it to a previously identified introgression event in the plant family Brassicaceae. Results: Our simulations reveal that ghostbuster accurately distinguishes ghost lineage introgression from ingroup introgression across a wide range of introgression scenarios, with errors arising only when divergence events are closely spaced. Our analysis of empirical plant data reveals that the previously identified introgression likely constitutes ghost lineage introgression and, thus, was previously misinterpreted.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

RIPK3-deficient mice or those harboring the kinase-inactivating mutation, RIPK3K51A, are ostensibly normal in the absence of challenge, indicating that RIPK3 and its kinase activity are dispensable for development. However, another kinase-inactivating mutation, RIPK3D161N, results in embryonic lethality in mice due to widespread apoptosis. As a result, the RIPK3D161N mutation is thought to confer a toxic gain-of-function. Here, to further explore the impacts of RIPK3 inactivation, we compared the stability and cellular interactions of RIPK3D161N and RIPK3K51A to a third previously-uncharacterized kinase-dead variant, RIPK3D143N. Here, we show that RIPK3K51A was unstable and did not associate with RIPK1, RIPK3D161N was unstable but interacted with RIPK1, whereas RIPK3D143N was stable and bound RIPK1 in a manner comparable to wild-type RIPK3. Thus, all three variants scaffold differently, suggesting that the assembly of cell death machinery by RIPK3 is finely tuned, not just by its kinase activity, but also by the conformation of its kinase domain. Physiologically, Ripk3D143N/D143N mice exhibited a partially penetrant lethality in utero. However, once born, Ripk3D143N/D143N mice were fertile and phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type mice in the absence of challenge, with RIPK3D143N mutation protecting mice lacking intestinal epithelial Caspase-8 from necroptotic ileitis. Our studies support the idea that RIPK3 is a nexus between apoptotic and necroptotic signaling, and highlight the importance of considering kinase domain conformation in RIPK3 inhibitor development.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Human life expectancy has increased dramatically over the past two centuries, marking a significant public health achievement. While some projections predict a future where median lifespans reach 100 years, others contend that further longevity will depend on breakthroughs targeting the biological processes of aging. Recent studies in mice have demonstrated that telomerase activation, achieved via gene therapy and transgenic approaches, can extend both median and maximum lifespans substantially without an accompanying increase in cancer risk. We analysed survival data from three such studies using the Gompertz mortality model and show that these interventions reduce the slope parameter, indicative of a slower aging rate, rather than merely lowering baseline mortality. This observation challenges traditional models that assume independent, additive damage accumulation, suggesting instead that aging is driven by a limited number of interdependent processes with significant cross-talk. Mathematical modelling indicates that only three to five processes with substantial cross-talk may account for the observed deceleration. Extrapolation using Swedish survivorship data further implies that a reduction in the aging rate, similar to that seen in mice, could elevate the median human lifespan from 85 to over 100 years. These findings provide a compelling framework for developing targeted anti-aging interventions and a new perspective on the modifiability of the aging process.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

While heterobifunctional Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) are more modular, the rational design of monovalent or molecular glue degraders remains challenging.

We identified an elaborated fumaramide handle that, when appended onto JQ1, led to the proteasome-dependent degradation of BRD4. Further characterization revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4DCAF16--a common E3 ligase target of electrophilic degraders--was responsible for BRD4 loss by covalently targeting C173 on DCAF16. While this original fumaramide handle, when appended onto other protein-targeting ligands, did not accommodate the degradation of other neo-substrates, a truncated version of this handle attached to JQ1 was still capable of degrading BRD4, now through targeting both C173 and C178. This truncated fumaramide handle, when appended on various protein targeting ligands, and was also more permissive in degrading other neo-substrates, including CDK4/6, SMARCA2/4, and the androgen receptor (AR). We further demonstrated that this optimized truncated fumaramide handle, when transplanted onto an AR DNA binding domain-targeting ligand, could degrade both AR and the undruggable truncation variant of AR, AR-V7, in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells in a DCAF16-dependent manner.

We applied translating ribosome affinity purification RNASeq on pre-cystic mouse kidneys to determine a cell-autonomous in vivo translatome associated with CDCA and identified Glis2 as an early effector of polycystin signaling. Here, to discover additional components of CDCA, we used polycystin-dependent Glis2 expression as a functional readout and identified Anks3, from the CDCA pattern translatome, as a candidate cytosolic regulator of polycystin signaling. Anks3 regulates polycystin-dependent Glis2 expression both in vitro and in vivo. Anks3 also undergoes polycystin-dependent changes in phosphorylation state. Inactivation of Anks3 in Pkd1 mouse models suppresses cyst progression, but also results in rapidly progressive kidney injury independent of polycystins. Anks3 inactivation also normalizes a broader spectrum of polycystin-dependent CDCA translatome changes. These findings define Anks3 as a central regulator of cilia dependent polycystin signaling, functioning downstream of cilia and polycystins and upstream of Glis2, and show that Anks3 has broader functions in maintaining renal structural and functional homeostasis.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

The stability of local adaptation is determined by selection-migration-drift balance: selection favours adaptive divergence whereas migration and random genetic drift cause the collapse of the divergence. How this balance determines the dynamics of local adaptation has been extensively studied. However, owing to the complexity of multi-population models, most previous theories used models with simple population structure and environmental variation, limiting their applicability to complex situations in nature. To address this issue, we developed a new theoretical method to analyze complex multi-population models, allowing heterogeneity in selection, migration, and population density. In essence, our method approximates a spatial model by a panmictic one-population model while retaining the core stochastic structure, enabling the application of conventional diffusion methods. By comparing with simulations, we confirmed that our method accurately describes stochastic evolutionary dynamics in various spatial models, provided sufficient levels of migration. This method is then applied to examine the effect of environmental distribution in 2D space. Assuming landscapes with different levels of the spatial autocorrelation of the environment, we found that the maintenance of locally adaptive alleles is significantly promoted when the spatial autocorrelation is high. These results highlight how complex spatial heterogeneity, as seen in nature, could affect the qualitative outcome of evolution.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Enhancing the genetic acquisition of resistance to ISAV is therefore important for sustainable fish farming. While previous genome-wide CRISPR screens have identified potential genetic targets for ISAV resistance in salmon, no causative genes have been functionally validated. In the current study, we investigated three key genes-st6gal1, ccdc115 and sec14l1-involved in the ISAV infection pathway as putative candidates for resistance. The role of these genes in ISA resistance was assessed by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) in Atlantic salmon kidney (ASK) cells. We achieved high editing efficiencies with large fragment deletions (up to 90 bp) using double sgRNAs at these three loci (89%, 100%, and 100%) with KO scores of 100, 71, and 100, respectively. Although gene KO induced varying levels of cell mortality, the deletion of these genes significantly reduced productive ISAV replication. Our study provides a functional validation of antiviral candidate genes in Atlantic salmon and demonstrates the utility of gene editing as a tool to dissect the genetic basis of disease resistance.

Compared to the original BEs (ABE8e and CBE4max-SpRY) derived from mammalian-cell models, our codon-optimized (COPT) BEs exhibited higher efficiency but lower bystander activity by targeting the pigment-related gene (tyr) in salmon. COPT BEs encoded by mRNA showed fewer editing patterns than plasmid-encoded BEs, mainly due to the limited lifespan of mRNA in cells. Furthermore, with these COPT editors, we were able to mutate multiple loci resulting in the complete loss of protein function in the fish genome.

Here, we directly sequence pre-mRNA without metabolic labelling or amplification to resolve transcription and multimodal pre-mRNA processing at single-molecule resolution. Using poly(A) tail measurement, we distinguish transcriptionally engaged pre-mRNA from polyadenylated transcripts, revealing that splicing is substantially delayed compared to previous estimates. Splicing is rare for at least 10 kb behind elongating RNA polymerase II such that thousands of genes remain largely unspliced during transcription, revising the notion that splicing is predominantly co-transcriptional. Progressive splicing becomes apparent only on polyadenylated transcripts, suggesting that splicing is commonly activated after 3' end formation. Unexpectedly, we find abundant m6A on unspliced pre-mRNA, indicating that a substantial portion of RNA methylation precedes splicing. This m6A methylation is suppressed around exon boundaries, indicating that m6A topology is established prior to exon junction complex deposition. Finally, we demonstrate that 3' end cleavage occurs multiple kilobases behind transcription in coordination with efficient transcription termination, and further highlight recursive 3' end formation across hundreds of genes. Conserved from human cells to mouse tissues, we illustrate a revised timeline for mRNA synthesis wherein cleavage, termination, and m6A deposition occur earlier than, or at least partially decoupled from, the bulk of splicing, reframing the sequence of early mammalian gene expression.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We observed that the AFF value of DNA sequences negatively correlates with species divergence time1, offering a quantitative measure of DNA preservation and host divergence. Some fragments distinct from modern genomic sequences, termed intermediate DNA sequences (IDS), have been identified. Many IDS exhibit an upper age limit, preserving characteristics of the last common ancestor (LCA) of the Hominidae and offering molecular insights into Darwin's puzzle. Among IDS, the SRRA subtype (Sequence Reversal and Rearrangement), identified in mRNA-coding exonic sequences, arises from the incorporation of a complementary antisense strand upstream of the sense strand, either adjacent to it or separated by a sequence interval. This introduces a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism at the mRNA level, driven by SRRA, which presets hairpin structures and Indels in the UTR or CDS of exonic sequences, modulating gene variation. We propose: SRRAs played a critical trial-and-error role in early Hominidae evolution, facilitating adaptive genomic changes, with some SRRA sequences later excised from exons, positioning SRRA as an evolutionary genetic switch. Additionally, seven species-specific fragments (SSFs) of non-human primates (NHPs) linked to Asian Homo erectus were identified in the fossils, and pottery DNA revealed sequences from tropical species (e.g., zebrass, oil palms), providing evidence of climate-driven local extinction and supporting paleo-ecological and paleo-environmental reconstruction.

Nevertheless, it is still limited by the scalability and efficiency of current cell culture technologies. In this study, we developed an RGD peptide-modified alginate hydrogel microtube microbioreactor (AlgTubes) to support the scalable culture of anchor-dependent cells, such as myoblasts and adipocytes, for cell-cultured meat production. AlgTubes provide a cell-friendly 3D microenvironment that enhances cell viability, growth, and yield while overcoming limitations of conventional bioreactors, such as shear stress, aggregation, and diffusion constraints. We successfully expanded mouse (C2C12) and quail (QM7) myoblasts in AlgTubes, achieving cell densities exceeding 1.0 x 10 cells/mL, far surpassing traditional stirred-tank bioreactors. Differentiation resulted in the formation of mature myotubes. Co-culturing myoblasts with mesenchymal stem cells or fibroblasts further improved yield and viability, particularly under differentiation conditions. By significantly increasing cell culture density, AlgTubes can substantially reduce culture volume, lowering labor requirements, reagent costs, equipment needs, facility space, and manufacturing expenses.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

LGR4/5/6 all bind to R-spondins (RSPOs) with high affinity and potentiate Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in response.

We have now generated a mutant RSPO2 furin domain that retains high affinity binding to LGR4/5/6 without signaling activity. Peptibodies based on this RSPO2 furin mutant were conjugated with either pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer or camptothecin derivative, and the resulting peptibodydrug conjugates (PDCs) showed potent and specific cytotoxic activity in neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer cell lines expressing any of LGR4/5/6 in vitro and robust anti-tumor activity in vivo.

Inherent to this approach is the subproblem of ordering the reads as per their (unknown) genomic positions of origin. However, existing approaches are not designed to explicitly target computation of this true ordering during the assembly process; instead the ordering information becomes available only after the assembly is complete. In this paper, we posit that prior computing of a reliable read ordering, even if imperfect, can significantly reduce the computational burden of the assembly process, preserve assembly quality, and enhance parallel scalability. Specifically, we present Tile-X, a novel graph-theoretic vertex reordering-centric approach to compute long read assemblies. The main idea of the approach is to efficiently compute an overlap graph first, use the overlap graph to (re)order the reads (vertices of the graph), and use that ordering to generate a partitioned parallel assembly. We test this idea with two classes of vertex reordering schemes: a) one that uses standard graph vertex reordering schemes that maximize graph locality or bandwidth measures; and b) another class where we custom define a sparsified reordering scheme that exploits sequence characteristics of the underlying graph to reduce the memory and time-footprint for the final assembly step. Using experiments on a combination of real-world and simulated PacBio High Fidelity (HiFi) long reads generated from real genomes, we demonstrate that the Tile-X approach is able to achieve substantial improvements over state-of-the-art long read assemblers, in memory efficiency and runtime, while preserving assembly quality metrics such as NGA50 and largest alignment. On average, across all the inputs, Tile-X achieved an NGA50 between 1.06x and 2.1x larger than state-of-the-art assemblers we compared with, while reducing runtime by up to 3.5x and memory consumption up to 3.3x.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

It consists of four receptors, EGF receptor (EGFR) and erythroblastoma oncogene B 2-4 (ERBB2-4), and their corresponding ligands. EGF signaling promotes intrahepatic cholangiocyte proliferation, bipotent cell transdifferentiation into cholangiocytes, bile duct branching, and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) aggressiveness.\n\nThe EGF family signaling contribution to extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD) regeneration is not well defined. This work is aimed at determining the fundamental role of the EGF signaling network in the biliary proliferative response to EHBD obstruction.\n\nApproachWe used mouse bile duct ligation to model obstructive EHBD injury, and human and mouse EHBD organoids for in vitro studies. We tested activating and inhibitory paradigms with recombinant EGF family ligands and receptor antagonists.\n\nTranscriptomic and immunohistochemistry analyses informed EGF signaling changes and cellular localization at homeostasis and after obstruction.\n\nResultsAt homeostasis, the EHBD expressed EGFR ligands Tgfa, Btc, Hb-egf and Nrg4 in cholangiocytes, and Egf in stromal cells. Erbb2 and Erbb3 were predominant receptors expressed in cholangiocytes and Egfr in stromal cells at baseline. After EHBD obstruction, injury-induced biliary hyperproliferation was associated with increased abundance of Areg, Hb-egf, Tgf and Btc ligands and Egfr receptor in cholangiocytes with resulting epithelial EGFR activation. In biliary organoids, EGFR ligands induced organoid growth, and inhibition of EGFR, but not ERBB2, dampened cholangiocyte proliferation. Accordingly, EGFR inhibition in mice led to a decrease in the biliary proliferative response after EHBD obstruction.\n\nConclusionThe obstruction-induced biliary proliferation is an EGFR-mediated response suggesting context-and receptor-specific EGF signaling network involvement in EHBD regeneration after injury.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

This reduction is even more pronounced in Holometabola, where the loss of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3 has occurred several times. In some Holometabola, DNA methylation is lost entirely. Methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins bind methylated CpGs and are therefore important readers of these epigenetic marks. We hypothesize that the evolutionary reduction of genome-wide methylation may be paralleled by changes to MBD proteins. Among insects, only a single MBD family member, MBD2/3, is known. Two isoforms of MBD2/3 have been identified in Bombyx mori, MBD2/3-L and MBD2/3-S. The long isoform MBD2/3-L contains a complete MBD domain spanning the first two exons, whereas the short isoform MBD2/3-S lacks the second exon and therefore half of its MBD domain. It has been reported that only the MBD2/3-L isoform is able to bind methyl-CpGs.\n\nIn this study, we analyzed transcriptomic and genomic sequence data across holometabolous orders to identify MBD2/3 genes and their isoforms. Our findings reveal that MBD2/3 is highly conserved in sequence and gene structure. While both isoforms are present in most hemimetabolous orders, the long isoform MBD2/3-L, capable of binding methylated CpG, has been lost in multiple holometabolous orders. The results suggest that MBD2/3 has lost its ability to bind methyl-CpG in several insect orders, with several independent losses in Holometabola. This occurred through different changes to the MBD domain, from sequence divergence within the domain to the absence of half of the MBD domain. These losses may be linked to the reduced levels of CpG DNA methylation.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

This phenomenon is believed to be largely due to phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin. In rodents and other species, PAP occurs predominantly or exclusively in fast twitch muscles. However, it has been suggested that in humans PAP occurs more or less independently of muscle fiber type.\n\nMethods18 healthy men and women (27{+/-}8 y) underwent an electrical muscle stimulation protocol during which two sets of four twitches were elicited both pre and post 6 s maximal voluntary contractions of both the triceps surae (60-70% slow twitch) and triceps brachii (60-70% fast twitch) muscles.\n\nResultsUnpotentiated peak twitch torque (PTT) was higher in the larger triceps surae vs. the smaller triceps brachii (i.e., 13.4{+/-}5.3 vs. 3.4{+/-}2.1 Nm; P = 8.22 x 10-13), but time to peak torque was shorter (i.e., 84{+/-}7 vs. 132{+/-}14 ms; P = 6.92 x 10-14) and the relative rate of torque development (RTD) was greater in the triceps brachii (2294{+/-}257 vs. 1425{+/-}102 %/s; P = 1.93 x 10-11).

They are known to be related which may explain higher risk of development of UC in patients with AD. The goal of this work is to review and analyse molecular mechanisms of UC in comparison to AD towards insights into UC complexity, potential comorbidities and novel therapies.\n\nMethodsWe developed graphical computational models of UC and AD molecular mechanisms (disease maps) by integrating information from over 800 manually curated articles. The maps are available online at https://imi-immuniverse.elixir-luxembourg.org. Disease-specific risk variants and gene expression profiles are visualised to identify signatures specific to UC, and shared with AD. Computational analysis shows key proteins, their interactions and pathways shared between UC and AD.\n\nResultsUC and AD maps include more than 2000 molecular interactions. Systematic computational comparison shows that both disorders exhibit epithelial barrier dysfunction, immune dysregulation involving abnormal Th2, Th1 and ILC response, common inflammatory pathways and biomarkers such as IL-13, IL-4R, IFNG, and IL-18. Visualisation and analysis of omics data demonstrates UC map usability.\n\nConclusionsWe developed the first computational graphic model of UC molecular mechanisms. Its content focuses on mechanisms of epithelial barrier disruption and downstream immune dysregulation through cytokines and other mediators. The comparison of UC to AD mechanisms demonstrates common signalling pathways and biomarkers, and supports potential drug repurposing and treatment options.

In the case of plants, nuclear (ITS) and plastid (rbcL, matK) markers are commonly utilized in union. Because the plastid regions are segments of protein-coding genes, their alignment and analysis are usually straightforward. By contrast, the assembly and validation of records for ITS is considerably more difficult for two reasons - the prevalence of indels and the presence of intraindividual variation. This complexity has provoked the development of several workflows to support the curation of reference databases for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region for plant barcoding. However, the pipelines used to create these databases lack functionalities which are essential to ensure a solid post-analytical validation. This paper presents a new workflow to address these shortcomings, with the goal of enhancing the reliability and accuracy of plant barcoding studies.

We present TARPON (Telomere Analysis and Research Pipeline Optimized for Nanopore), a best-practices Nextflow pipeline designed for the analysis of telomeres sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform. TARPON can be executed via the command line or integrated into ONTs EPI2ME agent, providing a user-friendly graphical interface for those without computational training. Nextflows container-based architecture eliminates dependency conflicts, streamlining deployment across platforms.\n\nTARPON isolates telomeric repeat-containing reads, assigns strand specificity, and identifies enrichment probes that can be used both for demultiplexing and for confirming capture-based library preparation. To ensure that the analysis is restricted to full-length telomeres, reads lacking a capture probe or adjacent non-telomeric sequence on the opposite end are excluded. A sliding-window approach defines the subtelomere-telomere boundary, followed by quality filtering to remove low-quality or subtelomeric reads that passed earlier steps.\n\nThe pipeline outputs customizable statistics, text-based summaries, and publication-ready visualizations (HTML, PNG, PDF).

Here we present a novel approach that leverages backpropagation through time (BPTT) to automatically fit a Hodgkin--Huxley (HH) conductance-based model to observed voltage traces. We unroll the HH model dynamics in time and treat the unknown maximum conductances as learnable parameters in a differentiable simulation. By optimizing the model to minimize the mean squared error between simulated and observed membrane voltage, our method directly recovers the underlying conductances (for sodium gNa, potassium gK, and leak gL) from a single voltage response. In simulations, the BPTT-trained model accurately identified conductance values across different neuron types and remained robust to typical levels of measurement noise. Even with a single current-clamp recording as training data, the approach achieved precise fits, highlighting its efficiency. This work demonstrates a powerful automated strategy for biophysical system identification, opening the door to rapid, high-fidelity neuron model customization from electrophysiological recordings.

In areas where these species co-exist, individuals gain protection from P. vivax more rapidly, and important biological differences between species may impact the immune response. CD4 T cells are key drivers of immunity to malaria, both as effector and helper cells, with T-follicular helper (Tfh) having key roles in antibody development. Comparative studies on CD4 T cell responses between these species are limited. Methods: We assessed CD4 T cells in adults with either P. falciparum or P. vivax malaria. Activation and proliferation of CD4 T cells were measured ex vivo, and functional capacity determined by intracellular cytokine staining by flow cytometry. Results: The phenotype, activation and proliferation of CD4 T cells and effector CD4 T cell subsets were comparable between species. However, within the peripheral (p)Tfh cell compartment, there was evidence for a skew towards pTfh1 cells in P. falciparum, and pTfh2 cells in P. vivax. Additionally, in P. falciparum, increased IL-10 production was detected, including within IL-21 producing CD4 T cells. Conclusion: While activation and function of CD4 T cells in malaria are largely comparable, some species-dependent responses are detected within the pTfh cell compartment that may impact antibody development.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Zoonotic transmission of avian influenza A viruses represents a significant threat to human health given the lack of population level immunity, which could translate into an influenza pandemic. Therefore, there is a need to better understand pre-existing human immunity against avian influenza strains. as highlighted by the recent rapid, global spread of avian H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b variants. Here, we sought to quantify the frequencies and specificities of B cells recognising avian hemagglutinin (HA) within unexposed adults, and to characterise the ability of seasonal immunisation to boost cross-reactive immune responses to H5Nx strains, including from clade 2.3.4.4b. Low but detectable serum antibody titres against H5 and H7 avian influenza HA were observed in donors. The frequency of memory B cells with cross-reactive recognition of H5 and H7 HA was low and 2-5 fold lower than populations of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 HA-specific B cells. Boosting of B cell responses against H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b HA following seasonal immunisation were sporadic with only 3 out of 19 individuals showing an increased population of probe-positive cells. Cross-reactive B cells generally expressed immunoglobulins drawn from variable heavy chain genes associated with recognition of the HA stem (VH6-1, VH1-69, VH1-18). CD4+ T cell responses towards H5 HA were also weakly boosted with little to no increase in circulating T follicular helper cell populations.

R.; Wu, X.; Park, J. M.", "abstract": "The DNA sensor cGAS and the signaling adaptor STING play a key role in the innate immune response to microbial and endogenous DNA in the cytoplasm. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway has evolved to promote immune defense and organismal fitness, yet its dysregulation can lead to chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Upon sensing double-stranded DNA, cGAS produces a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger that binds to STING in the endoplasmic reticulum. Ligand-bound STING translocates to the Golgi and activates the protein kinase TBK1 and the transcription factor IRF3, resulting in IRF3-driven interferon (IFN) gene transcription. This cascade of molecular events is mechanistically linked to intracellular lipid membrane dynamics and protein lipidation. To explore whether STING signaling is controlled by the availability and metabolic flux of cellular lipids, we screened small-molecule compounds targeting lipid metabolic pathways for their influence on STING agonist-responsive IFN induction. These screens identified inhibitors of the fatty acid synthase FAS and lipases as potent suppressors of STING signaling. An inhibitor of the cholesterol-esterifying enzyme SOAT1 enhanced STING-dependent IFN induction in mouse cells while attenuating it in human cells. Our findings reveal a connection between STING signaling and lipid metabolism and opportunities for expanding the toolbox for treating clinical conditions that arise from aberrant STING activity.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

This interplay is particularly relevant for preterm, low birthweight or otherwise immunocompromised infants, who have poor metabolic control and increased risks of sepsis. Here, we utilized data from the COPSAC2010 cohort with 700 mother-child pairs and showed that plasma levels of TCA cycle metabolites in early life were associated with reduced childhood risk of bacterial infection and an attenuated systemic inflammatory response. Next, we explored how two distinct nutritional strategies, which were aimed at boosting TCA cycle activity instead of glycolysis, impacted neonatal host defense against a serious bloodstream infection in preterm piglets. Substituting galactose for glucose in parenteral nutrition enhanced disease tolerance in early phase of infection and overall glucose homeostasis, improving survival. Further, combining glucose restriction with supplementation of glucogenic amino acids conferred glycemic control and completely prevented sepsis and abnormal changes of organ injury markers. Mechanistically, this intervention enhanced both disease resistance and tolerance, accompanied by metabolic rewiring from glycolysis towards gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle activity and oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, optimized nutritional strategies controlling the interplay of energy metabolism and host defense may be lifesaving for infected infants.\n\nIn briefNewborns rely on two distinct defense strategies to combat infections in early life.

Given the microbiomes role in gluten digestion and its susceptibility to antibiotics, we hypothesised that altering the microbiome with antibiotics would modify immune responses to gluten in mice. BALB/C mice consuming gluten-free chow received amoxicillin/clavulanate (5mg/kg) or PBS-vehicle daily for 5 days. Mice were then treated with a 3mg wheat-gluten suspension, or vehicle, on days 4 and 5 before sacrifice on day 7. Duodenal immune cells were analysed by histology and flow cytometry, while the duodenal MAM and faecal microbiome were characterised via 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, respectively. Antibiotic treatment followed by gluten reintroduction significantly reduced Staphylococcus in the duodenal MAM, enriched Bacteroides in faeces, and resulted in altered microbial carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, compared to vehicle controls. Treatment with antibiotics and gluten also increased duodenal eosinophils which positively correlated with the genus Blautia. Flow cytometry revealed that antibiotics and gluten treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active eosinophils and epithelial {gamma}{delta} T-cells, compared to vehicle control mice.

To address this gap, this study presents a novel application of video-rate two-photon fluorescence microscopy for high resolution, real-time imaging of fast-moving microorganisms. HNF Cafeteria roenbergensis is used as a model system to investigate dynamic grazing interactions between fluorescently stained bacteria and the flagellates, where the flagellates are detected via their intrinsic cellular autofluorescence. This two-photon microscope combined with real-time imaging capability enables continuous capture of contact, capture, ingestion, and digestion steps during grazing. Quantitative analysis across varying prey concentration reveals phase-specific durations and saturation behavior in grazing activities. Furthermore, transitions in grazing dynamics across two continuous periods of flagellates in starved and fed conditions are observed in live time series videos.

Fortunately, the nearly infinite number of choices available to the origami designer provide a rich environment in which to explore cooperativity in a complex system. The DNA domains comprising origami have predictable energetics and the sources of cooperativity are conceptually straightforward. While the assembly of these systems is difficult to predict because of the large number of cooperative interactions, it can be measured. We are thus able to probe cooperativity by using design variations and measuring their effect on assembly yield. We employ an accelerated assembly protocol that increases the sensitivity of structural perfection, or lack thereof, to design variation, and apply this approach to survey a broad set of design features. Using the resulting dataset, we develop metrics to correlate thermal stability, beneficial cooperativity from short folds, and detrimental cooperativity from long folds, with defectivity.

Whole blood is commonly separated into soluble and cellular fractions. However, this can introduce pre-analytical variability; and analysis of a single component (which is common) may ignore important pathophysiology. We have recently developed methods for the facile processing of dried blood for mass spectrometry-based quantification of the proteome, N-glycoproteome and phosphoproteome. Here, we applied this approach to 38 patients in Tanzania who presented to the hospital with sepsis. Blood was collected on Mitra devices at presentation and 1, 3 and 28-42 days post-enrollment. Processing of 96 total samples was performed in plate-based formats and completed within two days. Approximately 2,000 protein groups and 8,000 post-translational modifications were quantified in 3 LC-MS/MS runs at ~1.5 hours per sample. Analysis of differential abundance revealed blood proteome signatures of acute phase response and neutrophilic inflammation that partially resolved at the 28-42 day timepoint. Numerous analytes correlated with clinical laboratory values for c-reactive protein and white blood cell counts, as well as the Universal Vital Assessment illness severity score. These datasets serve as proof-of-concept for large scale MS-based (sub)phenotyping of disease using dried blood and are available via the ProteomeXchange consortium (PXD060377).", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we estimated this probability for two strains of Zika virus (ZIKV)--one sylvatic and one human-endemic--from two monkey species to Aedes albopictus mosquitoes using experimental infection data. Viral dynamics did not differ between monkey species, although one (cynomolgus macaque) is a native ZIKV host and the other (squirrel monkey) a novel host, but differed between strains, with viremia for the human-endemic strain peaking later and lower than the sylvatic strain. Only the sylvatic strain was transmitted to mosquitoes. In mosquitoes, anatomical barriers influence viral progression to salivary glands, complicating host infectiousness estimation. We quantified the probability of viral dissemination to the legs in Ae. albopictus, which increased with host viral load and was higher after feeding on squirrel monkeys than on cynomolgus macaques. We also found a positive relationship between virus titer in mosquito legs and virus detection in saliva after a 14-day extrinsic incubation period. Combining these factors, we found that squirrel monkeys were on average 1.5 times more infectious to Ae. albopictus than cynomolgus macaques.

Here we uncover the 2,8-dioxopurine pathway, a previously unrecognized anaerobic route for purine degradation in gut bacteria. This pathway uses a novel selenium-dependent enzyme, 2,8-dioxopurine dehydrogenase (DOPDH), and seven additional enzymes that together link purine metabolism to ATP generation and short chain fatty acid production. Competition experiments in gnotobiotic mice demonstrate that bacteria harboring this pathway exhibit a fitness advantage, with wild-type bacteria rapidly outcompeting a DOPDH-deficient strain. These findings highlight a host-microbe symbiosis, where host-secreted urate fosters a metabolic niche for bacteria that break it down.

We visualized the OME of single protein particles between cells and revealed that OME depends on the free diffusion of outer membrane (OM) contents.

Lotus corniculatus in natural populations that are continuously exposed to natural perturbations and microbial sources is an ideal plant model system to study the ecological processes that structure the distinct yet overlapping microbial communities in plant organs. We observed spatial and temporal variation in microbiomes associated with L. corniculatus roots, shoots, flowers, and seeds across seven grassland sites for four years. In this study we examined how abiotic and biotic factors in the local environment throughout multiple years contribute to the structure of microbiomes associated with L. corniculatus populations. We show that plant microbiomes are shaped by a set of environmental factors that are distinct to each plant compartment. These environmental factors either directly influence the plant microbiomes or by indirectly affecting them via other biotic factors. The environmental factors soil temperature seasonality, soil microbiome composition, air temperature seasonality, plant community richness, and grazing are found to influence the structure and microbial interactions in the plant organs, and are different in relationships with microbiomes with each compartment, possibly influencing dispersal decisions of microorganisms and consequently contribute in shaping distinct yet overlapping microbiomes across plant organs. Burkholderia and Sulfuritalea, plant-associated microbes that are highly correlated with environmental variables across all plant organs, respond to environmental variables differently depending on their organ microhabitat. This organ-dependent environmental perception is also observed in biomarker microbes in roots, shoots, and flowers, such as the rhizobial symbiont Mesorhizobium, leaf pathogen Setosphaeria, and necrotroph Botryotinia, respectively. Our knowledge about the organ-specific response of plant microbiomes to abiotic and biotic perturbations will equip us with a framework to understand and engineer plant microbiomes in the context of global climate change.

The direct bacteriolytic activity of complement molecules against Gram-negative bacteria acts via the formation of Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) pores. Bactericidal MAC pores damage the bacterial outer membrane, leading to destabilization of the inner membrane. Although it is well-established that inner membrane damage is crucial for bacterial cell death, the critical event causing MAC-mediated inner membrane damage remains elusive. Here we questioned whether the bacterial cell envelope possesses vulnerable spots for MAC pores to insert. We followed the localization of MAC pores on E. coli over time using fluorescence microscopy and elucidate that MAC deposition initiates at the new bacterial pole, which induces inner membrane damage and halts bacterial division. MAC components C8 and C9 preferentially localize at new bacterial poles, while C3b localizes randomly on the bacterial surface.

Despite its frequent dysregulation in cancers via mechanisms such as KSHV microRNA-mediated inhibition or AKT-driven phosphorylation and degradation, the impact of CASTOR1 loss on tumor initiation and progression remains poorly understood. Here, we identify CASTOR1 as a critical tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by demonstrating that its genetic ablation amplifies tumorigenesis in a KRAS-driven genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM;LSL-KRASG12D). CASTOR1 deficiency markedly enhances lung tumor incidence, accelerates tumor progression, and increases proliferative indices in KRASG12D-driven tumors (KRASG12D;C1KO) compared to CASTOR1 wild type (WT) tumors (KRASG12D;C1WT). Advanced-stage tumors exhibit elevated phosphorylated CASTOR1 (pCASTOR1) and reduced total CASTOR1 levels, suggesting active degradation during tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, CASTOR1 loss amplifies mTORC1 signaling, as evidenced by heightened phosphorylation of downstream effectors 4EBP1 and S6, while also augmenting AKT and ERK activation, uncovering a crosstalk between the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 and KRAS/ERK pathways. Furthermore, CASTOR1 ablation induces genome instability, which may contribute to enhanced tumor incidence and progression. Importantly, CASTOR1 deficiency confers resistance to KRASG12D-specific inhibitors, while over half of KRASG12D;C1WT tumors also display resistance. Organoids derived from KRASG12D;C1KO and KRASG12D;C1WT tumors reveal a correlation between KRAS inhibitor resistance and hyperactivation of mTORC1, with mTORC1 and PI3K inhibitors sensitizing resistant tumors to KRASG12D-targeted therapies.

The impact of this metabolic remodeling on cancer phenotypes remains poorly understood. Here, we find that the BCAA isoleucine is a primary source of propionyl-CoA in PDA cells. Reduction of propionyl-CoA availability by either genetic perturbation or isoleucine and valine starvation decreases histone propionylation (Kpr) without impacting histone acetylation on specific lysine sites, correlating with reduced transcription of certain lipid- and immune-related genes. Mechanistically, we find that multiple enzymes of isoleucine catabolism unexpectedly localize to and carry out multi-step isoleucine oxidation within the nuclei of PDA cells. Importantly, nuclear localization of the rate-limiting branched-chain alpha ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex is essential for isoleucine-dependent Kpr and gene regulation. Moreover, we demonstrate that isoleucine-sensitive Kpr and its associated gene expression are driven by the MYST family of lysine acyltransferases (KATs), and that the BCKDHA subunit of the BCKDH complex interacts with KAT7 within the nuclear compartment. BCAA catabolism enzymes are apparent in the nuclei of PanIN lesions in mice and PDA tumors in patients, contrasting that in healthy pancreatic acinar and ductal cells.

Here we tracked NEtD using longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) across eight time points in LTL331 from pre- to post-castration. Castration led to the loss of AR-high PRAD cells, expansion of AR-low populations, and emergence of an AR- and NE-negative (AR-/NE-) intermediate state that transitioned into NEPC. We delineate a model in which pre-EMT cells enriched in ciliogenesis and cell-adhesion pathways differentiate into EMT-like populations before branching into distinct ASCL1+ and ASCL1- NEPC states.

Data collected reveal circadian patterns in multiple spontaneous behaviors, aligning with known nocturnal tendencies. The system's potential to facilitate groundbreaking observations on the long-term behavioral correlates of various neuropsychiatric syndromes is aided by open-source software and relatively low cost.

Drug repurposing, the practice of identifying new therapeutic applications for existing drugs, offers a promising avenue for accelerated intervention. In this study, we utilized the yeast S. cerevisiae to screen a library of 1,760 FDA-approved compounds, both with and without rapamycin, to assess potential synergistic effects on yeast growth. We identified 87 compounds that showed synergistic effect with rapamycin and caused growth defects in yeast. These compounds were further screened for their effects on paralysis in a C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease. We found that three compounds synergistically delayed paralysis in combination with rapamycin. Additionally, four other compounds delayed paralysis when tested at different concentrations. Moreover, we tested fluphenazine, an antipsychotic drug identified in our screen, and found that it enhanced the overall health of treated worms. Western blot and X-34 staining confirmed that fluphenazine reduced amyloid-beta accumulation.

A combination of growth phenotyping, transcriptomics, and hormonomic profiling suggest that KIN10 loss disrupts energy-linked developmental processes. Compared to wild-type Col-0, kin10 displayed reduced sensitivity to glucose-induced root growth inhibition. Transcriptomic analysis of kin10 roots revealed widespread reprogramming of metabolic and hormonal pathways, with significant changes in secondary metabolism, cell wall remodeling, and hormone-related gene expression. Hormone profiling further indicated that KIN10 modulates auxin and jasmonate pathways in a carbon source- and organ-dependent manner, especially under sucrose supplementation.

We focused on the optomotor response, in which an animal moves in response to visual gratings, because it is quantitative, robust, and evolutionarily conserved.

We modulate heart rate by external threat, activation or blockade of the sympathetic nervous system, pharmacological blockade of the cardiac pacemaker channel, and direct optogenetic pacing of the heart, and find that the correlation persists through all perturbations. We find neurons in the primary sensory ganglia and several regions of the brain whose activity reflects changes in heart rate, some more active during bradycardia and some during tachycardia. Specifically, we show that the area postrema, known to be a center of cardiovascular integration, shows particularly strong encoding of heart rate, both following threat and during optogenetic cardiac pacing. We suggest that there may be neural mechanisms to assess heart rate changes over time, and that this interoceptive measurement is used to regulate other neural circuits and behavioral output.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

This study validates AAV tools for precise gene expression in pigeons. We identified AAV8 as a highly effective vector, demonstrating strong neuronal tropism and anterograde/retrograde transgene expression, while AAVretro was ineffective. The CaMKII promoter and mDLX enhancer enabled cell-type-specific expression, targeting predominantly excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively. Additionally, we established proof of concept for the expression of NpHR (a chloride pump) and demonstrated the functionality of conditional gene expression systems, including Cre/loxP and Tet-On/Tet-Off.

This plasticity allows the brain to rewire in response to specific sensory experiences.

While neuronal plasticity has been detected in visual target structures such as the colliculus, thalamus, and cortex, it remains unclear if the retina, the primary sensory organ, undergoes significant plasticity. Here, we show that the zebrafish retina demonstrates pronounced plastic transformations in response to alterations of the visual environment during development, which ultimately modifies the detection of oriented visual stimuli. We demonstrate that orientation-selective amacrine cells undergo profound morphological changes in animals exposed to distinct visual environments during development. We further find that the functional orientation-selective output from the retina is altered in a manner consistent with the visual environment in which the animals are raised and that these changes are persistent. Finally, animals tested in a virtual reality system show that early exposure to different visual environments changes their innate preference for specifically oriented patterns.

We established methods to image the activity of 1000s of neurons throughout a large region of mouse LPBN. Food consumption drove a seconds-long wave of activity across LPBN, with dynamics mirroring the movement of food through the upper gastrointestinal tract observed using X-ray fluoroscopy. By imaging the same neurons across days, we found that spatially clustered subsets of neurons encoded oral signals, stomach filling, visceral malaise, arousal, and/or body movement.

Two assumptions motivating the use of cTBS are that it will i) inhibit neural activity in the targeted area, and ii) consequently disinhibit neural activity in the mirroring region in the contralateral cortex. Here, we test these assumptions in the oculomotor system of the rhesus macaque. In two macaques, we delivered cTBS between blocks of trials where they performed a delayed pro-/anti-saccade task, delivered cTBS to the right PFC (areas 8Ar and 46, which includes the frontal eye fields; 32 cTBS-PFC sessions), to the air as a SHAM control (27 cTBS-SHAM sessions), or to the nearby primary motor cortex as a brain control (21 cTBS-M1 sessions). Across these different types of sessions, we compared changes in oculomotor behavior (reaction times, error rates, peak saccade velocity), and changes in neural activity recorded from the left, contralateral PFC. Despite multiple lines of evidence consistent with TMS influencing neural activity in the cTBS-PFC and cTBS-M1 sessions, we found no behavioral evidence for inhibition of the right PFC in the cTBS-PFC sessions, nor any evidence for contralateral disinhibition in the left PFC.

However, in non-poultry birds the long-term maintenance and self-renewal of PGCs in vitro remains challenging. This limitation hinders biobanking in other avian clades, particularly in the zebra finch and other songbirds that uniquely possess a germline restricted chromosome (GRC). Here, we generated and compared short-term cultures of chicken and zebra finch PGCs from the embryonic gonads or blood, as well as established long-term cultures of chicken PGCs. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that the transcriptome profile of long-term chicken gonadal cultures were exclusively PGCs, whereas the short-term chicken and zebra finch cultures represented a heterogeneous mixture of cell types. The zebra finch culture further included rapidly differentiating PGCs, as well as a germ cell type not previously identified in the embryonic songbird gonad. Although zebra finch short-term gonadal cultures did not yield robust long-term PGC cultures, short-term cultured PGCs were able to integrate into host zebra finch gonads after injection into the dorsal aorta, contribute to gametic populations in adult chimeras, and give rise to phenotypically- and genomically-validated offspring. This study provides a foundation for using short-term gonadal cultures to derive donor and transgenic offspring in songbirds and further explore the unique developmental genetics of PGCs across the avian clade.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We studied spatial and behavioural interactions between young calves ([&le;]6 months old) and conspecific females ([&ge;]5 years old) to understand social ontogeny in a wild Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) population in Nagarahole and Bandipur National Parks, southern India. We found that elephant groups with calves comprised females -- mother and 'escort', who provided active care, and females who did not provide overt, active care -- 'other females'. Escorts, apart from coordinating their movement with the calf, provided allomaternal care by initiating positive and helpful interactions with the calf. Other females rarely initiated interactions, which were usually negative, towards calves. Primarily calves, rather than conspecific females, initiated and terminated proximity contacts and behavioural interactions. Calves were near and interacted similarly with their mothers and escorts, under feeding, resting, and social contexts, and almost never interacted with other females. Similarly, we found remarkable similarities between mothers and escorts in their behaviours towards calves, with the primary difference being that escorts did not provide milk. Our results suggest that calves begin to form differentiated social relationships from a young age. The presence of calves and their interactions with escorts might result from existing close social relationship between mothers and escorts or may establish new relationships. Allomaternal care may also reinforce relationship differentiation in such social species. As calf-escort interactions involved behaviours that may potentially be helpful in protection and feeding skill acquisition, the development and survival of calves may be affected by the presence of, and interactions, with allomothers.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

These methods are applied to feature selection from Five diverse collections of datasets, including datasets related to Mixed-lineage Leukaemia (MLL), Lung Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Central Nervous System (CNS), and Colon Cancer. For each feature, fitness values are calculated using the four aforementioned feature selection methods. After that, a stratified 10-fold cross-validation procedure is conducted using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) to determine the classification accuracy for each feature. A set of five microarray datasets was used in this evaluation in order to assess the effectiveness of the filter methods. The results of this study represent the first comprehensive analysis and comparison of gene expression datasets filtered using a variety of ranking strategies. Among these approaches, entropy-based methods (e.g., mRMR) emerge as the most effective.

This study of post-mortem human AUD combines microglial immunoreactivity (+IR) protein and changes in microglial gene expression (mRNA) in human orbital frontal cortex (OFC) in an effort to better characterize the reactive microglia associated with AUD. Since reactive microglia are linked to reactive astrocytes (GFAP+IR), oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG+IR), and neurodegeneration (NeuN, MAP2+IR), we assessed these markers within the OFC. AUD reactive microglia were identified by increases in Iba1, CD11b (Mac1-OX42), CX3CR1, CSF1R, CD68, CCR2, P2RY12, SYK, and TFE3+IR in AUD OFC compared to control moderate drinkers. Tmem119+IR was decreased in AUD brain. Several of these microglial genes had parallel changes in +IR protein and mRNA. However, several microglial markers commonly used to identify reactive microglia did not show changes in mRNA, including Iba1, CD68, P2RY12, and CSF1R+IR. Overall, AUD microglia show increases in monocyte phagocytic markers, but not TREM2, DAP, or complement genes. Reactive microglial markers were highly correlated with reactive astrocyte GFAP+IR, oxidative stress 8-OHdG+IR, and loss of neurons (NeuN, MAP2+IR). Mediation analysis indicated reactive microglia contribute to both reactive astrocytes and oxidative stress, but only reactive astrocytes were found to significantly contribute to loss of neurons (NeuN+IR). These findings are supported by mouse studies finding chronic ethanol exposure increases reactive astrocytes and oxidative stress that is inhibited by DREADD blockade of microglial activation.

Electrophysiological studies in rodents have revealed critical roles of theta (4-12Hz) oscillations in amygdala and hippocampus during both fear learning and extinction, and engram research has shown that extinction relies on the formation of novel, highly context-dependent memory traces that suppress the initial fear memories. Whether similar processes occur in humans and how they relate to previously described neural mechanisms of episodic memory formation and retrieval remains unknown. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in epilepsy patients provide direct access to the deep brain structures of the fear and extinction network, while representational similarity analysis (RSA) allows characterizing the memory traces of specific cues and contexts. Here we combined these methods to show that amygdala theta oscillations during extinction learning signal safety rather than threat and that extinction memory traces are characterized by stable and context-specific neural representations that are coordinated across the extinction network. We further demonstrate that context specificity during extinction learning predicts the reoccurrence of fear memory traces during a subsequent test period, while reoccurrence of extinction memory traces predicts safety responses.

Simultaneously, advancements in CHO cell genome assembly have provided insights for developing sophisticated genetic engineering strategies. While the majority of these efforts have focused on coding genes, with some interest in transcribed non-coding RNAs (e.g., microRNAs and lncRNAs), there remains a lack of genome-wide systematic studies that precisely examine the remaining 90% of the genome. This unannotated \"dark matter\" includes regulatory elements and other, poorly understood or characterized functionality of the genome that may be potentially critical for cell survival. In this study, we deployed a genome-scale CRISPR screening platform with 112,272 paired guide RNAs targeting 14,034 genomic regions for complete deletion of 150 kb long sections. This platform enabled the execution of a negative screen that selectively identified dying cells to determine regions essential for cell survival. By using paired gRNAs, we overcame the intrinsic limitations of traditional frameshift strategies, which will likely have little or no effect on the non-coding genome. This study revealed 427 regions essential for CHO survival, many of which currently lack gene annotation or known function. For these regions we present annotation status, transcriptional activity as well as annotated chromatin states such as enhancers. Selected regions, specifically those that were negative for all the above, were individually deleted for confirmation. This work sheds a novel light on a substantial part of the mammalian genome which is traditionally difficult to investigate and therefore, neglected.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "When cells divide, the newly replicated sister chromatids must be segregated evenly to the daughter cells. During mitosis, mechanical force is applied by spindle microtubules in 2 ways: first by pushing on chromosome arms to promote chromosome congression to the cell equator in metaphase, and then by pulling on kinetochores to promote sister chromatid disjunction during anaphase. For segregation to proceed faithfully, the pliable interphase chromatin must be transformed into stiff mitotic chromosomes able to withstand these forces. However, it is unclear how the cell establishes chromosome stiffness and what the consequences are for dividing cells if this stiffness is disrupted. Many of the structural changes imposed on chromosomes in mitosis are driven by Condensin complexes, in conjunction with Topoisomerase II. Here, we have combined rapid protein depletion and live cell imaging with in-depth mechanical characterization of purified mitotic chromosomes to probe the roles of Condensins I and II in the establishment and maintenance of the mechanical strength of mitotic chromosomes. We show that Condensin I, but not Condensin II, is required to establish chromosome stiffness and chromatin elasticity, and yet ceases to be required for the maintenance of these properties once chromosome formation has been completed. Nevertheless, depletion of Condensin I from already formed chromosomes still impacts centromeric chromatin and leads to a loss of sister centromere cohesion. We propose that the extensive chromatin loop network established by Condensin I is locked in place by Topoisomerase II mediated DNA catenation.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Alport syndrome, a genetic kidney disease in children, is characterized by GBM structural defects and ectopic laminin-2 deposition, but the source of this laminin remains unknown. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic models, we demonstrated that ectopic laminin-2 originates not from local kidney cells but from the circulation.

Podosomes play important roles in cell adhesion and migration as well as the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix. While podosomes are always closely associated with the plasma membrane, the structural components linking the podosome core, composed of branched actin, to the membrane are not fully understood. In this study we show that class I myosins, Myo1e and Myo1f, localize to a specific region of podosomes, underneath the podosome core and near the ventral plasma membrane, and that this localization is mainly mediated by the Myo1e/f TH2 domains. Respective knockdowns or knockouts of Myo1e/f lead to increased podosome size, altered turnover and lateral mobility, which is likely due to Myo1e/f regulating the attachment of core actin filaments to the plasma membrane. In addition, Myo1e/f double knockout macrophages were characterized by a reduction in 3D and 2D migration, even though these cells exhibited increased ability to degrade the extracellular matrix. Along with the other membrane-associated podosome components, such as the transmembrane proteins MT-MMP and CD44, and the GPI-anchored DNase X, Myo1e and Myo1f mark the membrane-proximal region of podosomes.

In vitro, there is no immediate loss of cell viability and this remains true throughout 14 days of live cell viability monitoring. Further, when the RPE cells are cultured over 14 days, they attach within 24 hours and become confluent, with normal morphological appearances. The formation of tight junctions is unimpeded with the typical polygonal pattern observed. The effects of shear stress due to passage of the cells through a small lumen were not evident in cultured cells labelled for the cytoskeletal protein F-actin. RPE cell VEGF secretion is unaffected by microneedle size in primary RPE and iPSC RPE cells.

We previously identified VGLL1, a coactivator of TEAD transcription factors, as a human-specific placental marker. In this study, we employed a pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-based model of TE induction by BMP4 to investigate chromatin remodeling and transcriptional dynamics during TE specification. BMP4-induced chromatin accessibility changes promoted a trophoblast gene expression program, while mesoderm lineage markers were only transiently expressed upon canonical WNT activation. We found that VGLL1 was expressed downstream of key TE transcription factors (GATA2/3, TFAP2A/C) but was essential for full trophoblast differentiation by up-regulating EGFR and reinforcing GATA3 expression through positive feedback. Notably, VGLL1 enhanced canonical WNT signaling via direct regulation of WNT receptors and effectors. We also identified KDM6B, a histone demethylase that removes H3K27me3 repressive marks, as a direct VGLL1 target. KDM6B facilitated activation of bivalent promoters associated with TE markers, linking epigenetic regulation to lineage specification.

Methods: Our proposed Fast-CrCEST method acquires Cr maps at a temporal resolution of 10s by applying RF saturation (B1) at only +/-1.8 ppm, in contrast to the conventional CrCEST protocol, which employs six frequency offsets and requires 30s per acquisition. Given that magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) depends on B0 inhomogeneity, we modeled the pre-exercise MTRasym for each muscle as a function of the corresponding B0 inhomogeneity. This model was subsequently used to correct pixel-wise post-exercise B0 shifts, allowing isolation of signal changes specifically associated with exercise-induced alterations in creatine levels. Seven subjects performed plantar flexion exercise at 3T, while CrCEST, fast-CrCEST, and 31P-MRS were performed. Recovery time constants in the gastrocnemius muscles, obtained from CrCEST (TCr) and fast-CrCEST (TfCr), were compared with those derived from 31P-MRS (TPCr). To compare the accuracy of Cr recovery time constant measurements between CrCEST and fast-CrCEST, we performed simulations using 10s and 30s sampling intervals, incorporating experimentally measured noise levels. Results: TfCr showed a significant 1:1 correlation with TPCr (R2 = 0.57, p = 0.048), whereas TCr values were approximately three times higher than TPCr, with a weaker correlation (R2=0.47, p=0.087). Conclusion: We present a novel method for correcting exercise-induced B0 shifts in fast-CrCEST.

Here, we report a novel bioink in which taurine is first methacrylated substituting its NH2 groups to afford taurine methacrylate (TMA)enabling covalent integration into gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) networks.

In engineered biological systems, on-demand activation or repression of transcription underpins the design of genetic programs that control synthesis of useful products. Even electrical stimuli can be used to control gene expression, but previous such electrogenetic approaches have required a combination of exogenous redox mediators and complex regulatory proteins. Here we show that transcription can be modulated electrically in a cell-free system through the use of a DNA triplex as a molecular brake, which is opened or closed by means of electrolytic decomposition of water. Our DNA constructs comprise a double-stranded region with a single-stranded tail that folds over to form a triplex, where this construct is made using a customised synthesis protocol. Over measurements of 48 triplex-forming constructs and their corresponding controls, we observe that triplexes inhibit gene expression more often than not.

SNX proteins comprise a banana-shaped BAR domain that acts as a curvature-inducing scaffold and a phosphoinositide lipids sensitive Phox-Homology Domain (PXD) that interacts with the membrane to ensure specific and efficient organelle binding. In concert with the larger retromer machinery, these proteins traffic and recycle cargo between the endosomal membrane, trans-Golgi network, and plasma membrane. Interestingly, the SNX1-SNX5 heterodimeric construct forms a part of the newly discovered pathway where cargo sorting and membrane remodeling can take place in a retromer-independent fashion. In this work, we use molecular dynamics and continuum mechanics simulations to understand the features of SNX1-SNX5 heterodimer, especially the molecular determinants at PXDs, which impart organelle membrane specificity and retromer-independent cargo recognition ability to these proteins. Our all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with isolated PXDs and full-length SNX1-SNX5 on bilayers show that SNX1-PXD has robust membrane-binding features that are largely insensitive to single or double mutation of the basic residues on its surface. Comparing the simulation-based binding poses against the recently solved cryo-EM structures of tubular membrane-bound SNX1 homodimer and SNX1-SNX5 heterodimer also provided interesting insights into the association profile of isolated PXDs when they have the freedom to explore different membrane-binding poses.

ATS1 arises from loss-of-function mutations in Kir2.1, the inward rectifying potassium channel responsible for most of IK1 in ventricular cardiomyocytes. IK1 is suppressed by SUMOylation, a post-translational modification upregulated in hypoxia, a known proarrhythmic stimulus. We investigated whether current from the ATS1-linked variant Kir2.1-R67Q is inhibited by hypoxia and whether this suppression can be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of the SUMO pathway. Methods: We used patch-clamp recording to measure IK1 and Kir2.1 currents under acute hypoxia, with and without the SUMO pathway inhibitor TAK-981. To quantify SUMOylation stoichiometry, we applied single molecule photobleaching. A multidisciplinary approach combining electrophysiology, molecular modeling, and optogenetic phosphoinositide was used to measure the impact of Kir2.1-R67Q and SUMOylation on channel interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a required gating cofactor. Results: Kir2.1 can be modified by up to two SUMO proteins attached to diagonally opposite subunits, with each SUMOylation event reducing current by ~20%. Heterozygouse channels containing two R67Q subunits were more susceptible to hypoxic suppression than wild type. TAK-981 blocked hypoxic inhibition of IK1 in ventricular cardiomyocytes and abolished Kir2.1 SUMOylation. In cells expressing Kir2.1-R67Q, TAK-981 significantly increased currents and mitigated hypoxic suppression. Computational modeling and optogenetic dephosphorylation revealed that both the R67Q mutation and converge to disrupt Kir2.1- PIP2 interactions, producing synergistic inhibition of channel function. Conclusions: Hypoxia-induced SUMOylation and the R67Q mutation synergistically suppress Kir2.1 activity by impairing channel-PIP2 interactions. TAK-981 restores IK1 by preventing SUMOylation under hypoxic conditions and enhancing current through Kir2.1-R67Q channels. These findings support a two-hit model of arrhythmogenesis in ATS1 and identify SUMO pathway inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce arrhythmic risk in affected patients.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, we analyzed serum samples from a cohort of MS patients in Qatar using high-throughput KoRectly Expressed (KREX) immunome protein-array technology. Compared to healthy controls, MS patients showed significantly altered autoantibody responses to 129 proteins, with a notable enrichment in autoantibodies targeting antiviral immune response-related proteins. Machine learning analysis identified a distinct molecular signature comprising 17 differentially expressed autoantibodies, including those against MX1, ISG20, MAX, SUFU, NR1H2, HMGN5, and EPHA10. Among these, autoantibodies against MX1-a key effector in the interferon-alpha/beta signaling pathway-showed the most pronounced increase, with nearly a threefold elevation in MS patients. While MX1 has previously been implicated in MS, this is the first report of autoantibody reactivity against the protein, suggesting a potential role in disease onset and progression. These findings support a link between antiviral immune responses and MS pathophysiology and offer a promising blood-based autoantibody signature that could inform future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We found significant reductions of secondary saccade latency, as well as improved decoding of the post-saccadic target location from the EEG signal when motion streaks were available. These signals arose as early as 50 ms after saccade offset and had a clear occipital topography.

Q.", "abstract": "CACNA1A encodes the P/Q-type CaV2.1 calcium channels whose function underlies neuronal excitability, presynaptic neurotransmitter release, and Ca2+ signaling in neurons. Pathogenic variants in CACNA1A have been found in individuals with various neurological conditions, including hemiplegic migraine, epilepsy, developmental delay, and ataxia. Clinical presentations can vary significantly between patients, with limited information known about the underlying neurobiology of these different clinical patterns. Adding further complication, prior work on pathogenic missense variants has demonstrated variable impacts on CaV2.1 channel function, sometimes in opposite directions. As such, the relationships between specific coding variants, electrophysiological properties, and clinical phenotypes remain elusive. In this study, we determined the biophysical properties of an allelic series of 42 de novo missense CACNA1A variants discovered in a neurodevelopmental disorder cohort of more than 31,000 individuals, together with the most common eight coding variants found in the general population. We found that all but one de novo variant altered at least one aspect of the channel properties examined, and the majority (70%) of the variants reduced the channel current density. In addition, for variants that encode human CaV2.1 channels (hCaV2.1) with detectable currents, nearly 50% altered how channels respond to membrane potential, while common variations did not significantly change any channel biophysical properties. Coupled with our functional analyses and AlphaMissense prediction, we showed that CaV2.1 missense variants significantly underlie the risk of developmental epileptic encephalopathy. Subsequently, we examined the physiological impact of variant hCaV2.1 using NEURON simulations as an omnibus output of neuronal function and found that abnormal biophysical channel properties have a profound impact on Purkinje cell excitability. Most interestingly, we correlated the clinical phenotype with molecular consequences of missense variants provided by our comprehensive functional analyses and found that distinct CaV2.1 channel molecular function is significantly associated with different clinical outcomes. By analyzing an entire allelic series of CACNA1A de novo changes in a large cohort of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, we provide a powerful approach to dissecting the role of missense variants in CACNA1A channelopathy, which in turn may help pave the way for future precision medicine initiatives.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

These effects contribute to long-term cognitive and behavioral impairments observed in animal models. Epidemiological and prospective clinical studies have also reported associations between early-life exposure to anesthesia and neurodevelopmental deficits in children, raising significant concerns about pediatric anesthesia and highlighting the urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of anesthetic-induced developmental neurotoxicity (AIDN) using human-relevant models.\n\nMethodsThis study employed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids that were exposed to varying doses of anesthetic propofol for 1 to 6 hours, including single and repeated exposures. In parallel, serum samples were collected pre- and post-surgery from pediatric patients under 4 years old (n = 10 per group) who underwent either short (<1 hour) or prolonged anesthesia (>3 hours) at the Childrens Hospital of Wisconsin between September 2018 and October 2019. Pathological changes in organoids were assessed using chemical assays, electron microscopy, and western blotting. Brain injury-related proteins in patient serum were quantified via ELISA. Genome-wide expression profiling was conducted on 18,855 mRNAs and 27,427 lncRNAs in organoids and serum using microarray and bioinformatics.\n\nResultsHigher doses, longer duration, and repeated exposures to propofol led to increased apoptosis in organoids. Six-hour exposure induced autophagy as evidenced by LC3-II elevation and led to dysregulation of 553 mRNAs and 792 lncRNAs in organoids, along with their co-expressed signaling networks, affecting pathways related to synaptic integrity, mitochondrial function, and inflammation. ELISA and serum analysis of pediatric patients (<4 years old) exposed to anesthesia (>3 hours) demonstrated elevated brain cell injury-associated proteins (e.g., increased NSE) and brain cell type-specific gene expression changes. Serum findings corroborated organoid data, identifying 21 mRNAs and 12 lncRNAs that were dysregulated in both models and associated with cell injury, neuronal development, inflammation, and learning deficits.\n\nConclusionsThis study represents the first integrative transcriptomic analysis of AIDN using both 3D human cerebral organoids and pediatric patient serum--two complementary, human-relevant models. By identifying consistently dysregulated coding and non-coding RNAs across both platforms, we provide compelling evidence of shared molecular signatures linked to neuronal injury, inflammation, and neurodevelopmental disruption. These findings offer not only mechanistic insights but also lay the groundwork for the development of minimally invasive biomarkers and future therapeutic strategies. This dual-model approach bridges experimental discovery with clinical relevance, advancing the translational understanding of pediatric anesthetic neurotoxicity and supporting efforts to improve long-term neurological outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

This strategy raises issues of interpretation that we highlight here with a multimodal brain imaging dataset and simulation studies. Twenty-four healthy participants completed neuroimaging with both [11C]Cimbi-36 positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans to estimate receptor binding potential (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), respectively, in 18 cortical/subcortical regions. Correlations between BP and CBF were estimated in three ways: 1) Pearson correlation across regions of mean regional BP and CBF ({rho}l), to mimic studies using data from independent cohorts; 2) Pearson correlation between BP and CBF across participants in each region ({rho}2); or 3) the correlation between BP and CBF across participants across all regions within a single linear mixed effects model ({rho}3). We observed a significant positive correlation across regions ([Formula]l = 0.672; p = 0.0023). Region-specific correlations across participants were substantively lower and not statistically significant ([Formula]2: mean = 0.140, range = -0.112 to 0.336; all p > 0.10), nor when estimated simultaneously within a linear mixed model ([Formula]3 = 0.138, p = 0.26). Our simulation study illustrated that regional differences in BP or CBF mean and variance can bias across regions correlations by 1000% or create a type-1 error of 100%. Our observations that both the estimated correlation and the statistical significance can differ greatly highlights that inferring across region correlation as evidence for correlation across participants is erroneous. Without validated methods that limit confounding and other biases, we discourage future studies from inferring across region correlation of population-level brain maps from independent cohorts in this manner.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

In this paper, we formalize and evaluate two methods for mapping timescales in resting-state fMRI: a time-domain fit of an autoregressive (AR1) model and an autocorrelation-domain fit of an exponential decay model. Rather than assuming exponential autocorrelation decay, we define timescales by projecting the fMRI time series onto these approximating models, requiring only stationarity and mixing conditions while incorporating robust standard errors to account for model misspecification. We introduce theoretical properties of timescale estimators and show parameter recovery in realistic simulations, as well as applications to fMRI from the Human Connectome Project. Comparatively, the time-domain method produces more accurate estimates under model misspecification, remains computationally efficient for high-dimensional fMRI data, and yields maps aligned with known functional brain organization.

V.; Guenat, O. T.; Dai, Z.; de Jesus Perez, V. A.", "abstract": "Rationale: Endothelial dysfunction is a key feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We previously identified Wnt7a, a ligand of the Wnt planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, as essential for pulmonary angiogenesis, with its loss linked to PAH. Given the importance of Wnt/PCP to lung endothelial function and angiogenesis, our goal is to elucidate how Wnt/PCP regulates angiogenic responses in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). ROR2, a tyrosine kinase receptor specific to Wnt/PCP, is crucial for cardiovascular development, but its role in PAH is unclear. We hypothesized that ROR2 supports endothelial homeostasis, and its loss would impair angiogenesis, contributing to PAH. Methods: Endothelial-specific ROR2 knockout (ROR2 ECKO) and wild-type (WT) mice were studied under normoxia and chronic hypoxia using echocardiography, hemodynamics, and lung morphometry. PMVECs from healthy and PAH lungs were transfected with ROR2 siRNA/constructs for functional and molecular studies. Focal adhesion (FA) activation and force generation were assessed via FRET-based methods. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses were performed on siROR2 PMVECs and ROR2 ECKO lungs. Results: ROR2 ECKO mice exhibited worsened pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular remodeling, microvascular loss, and muscularization in hypoxia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung endothelial cells showed dysregulation of pathways involved in barrier formation and angiogenesis. Evans blue dye extravasation confirmed reduced endothelial barrier integrity in ROR2 ECKO mice. ROR2-deficient PAH PMVECs displayed increased adhesion, permeability, and FA numbers, with reduced VE-cadherin at cell junctions. Confocal imaging revealed ROR2 localization in FAs, interacting with integrin ?1 (ITGB1). FRET analysis showed that ITGB1 remained in an active, adhesion-promoting state in ROR2-deficient cells. Restoring ROR2 in PAH PMVECs normalized adhesion, barrier function, and FA abundance. Transcriptomic analysis identified Rab12 as a key mediator of ROR2-ITGB1 crosstalk, with Rab12 knockdown mimicking ROR2 deficiency in PMVECs. Conclusions: ROR2 regulates pulmonary angiogenesis by maintaining endothelial barrier integrity and facilitating integrin recycling. Restoring ROR2 signaling could be a potential therapeutic approach for PAH.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We investigate this question in recurrent neural networks with linear additive stochastic dynamics. We assume that the synaptic connectivity can be expressed in a low-rank form, parameterized by a handful of connectivity vectors, and and examine how the geometry of emergent activity relates to these vectors. Our findings reveal that this relationship critically depends on the dimensionality of the external stochastic inputs. When inputs are low-dimensional, activity is confined to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by a subset of the connectivity vectors, whose dimensionality matches the rank of the connectivity matrix, along with the external inputs. Conversely, when inputs are high-dimensional, activity is generally high-dimensional; recurrent dynamics shape activity within a subspace spanned by all connectivity vectors, with a dimensionality equal to twice the rank of the connectivity matrix. Applying our formalism to excitatory-inhibitory circuits, we discuss how inputs geometry also play a crucial role in determining the amount of input amplification generated by non-normal dynamics.

Male and female Tg-SwDI mice were treated for 5 months with sub-depressor doses of either telmisartan [angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)] or lisinopril [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor] starting at 3 months of age.

Outcomes in drug-treated and untreated Tg-SwDI mice were compared to each other and with wild-type (C57BL/6J) controls. Overall, both drugs were able to rescue some cognitive-behavioral functions; however, no reductions in A{beta} levels were observed, and only limited improvements in vascular density and neuroinflammatory markers were detected.

Our results revealed cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the hippocampus of 3-month-old 5XFAD mice, including downregulation of synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission genes in the CA1 and dentate gyrus excitatory neurons, impaired endothelial gene expression linked to brain barrier function and angiogenesis, altered innate immune response genes in astrocytes, as well as upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism genes in the CA1 excitatory neurons. These findings underlie the intricate interplay between BBB disruption and metabolic dysregulation before the onset of cognitive decline in AD. Our study demonstrates that BBB dysfunction and cerebral metabolic alterations preceded brain hypoperfusion and cognitive decline, emphasizing potential molecular pathways for early intervention. These findings, once validated in human studies, could significantly enhance early diagnosis and inform novel therapeutic strategies targeting early AD pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by visual field loss, classically due to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. Current treatment options reduce IOP, but progressive RGC degeneration persists. The ability to reprogram de novo RGCs from human corneal keratocytes provides a valuable tool to potentially restore vision in patients with late-stage disease when most RGCs are irreversibly damaged. We investigate the survival of these human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived RGCs after culturing them in human donor eyes under conditions of elevated and normal IOP using the pressurized ocular translaminar autonomous system (TAS) chamber. The hiPSCs were generated by reprogramming human donor keratocytes using Sendai viral vectors with Yamanaka factors. The hiPSCs were then differentiated into retinal organoids (ROs) from which RGCs were obtained. The RGCs were transduced with AAV2-CBA-EGFP (Adeno-Associated Virus serotype 2- Chicken Beta Actin- Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) and successfully transplanted into donor human eyes obtained from individuals having non-ocular history. They were pressurized for 5-7 days, with the left eye maintained at normal IOP and right eye at high IOP. Viability was measured by expression levels of pro-survival pathways via qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry staining, and electroretinography (ERG) for retinal function. After RGC transplantation, increased expression of pro-survival and decreased inflammatory and apoptotic markers were identified in normal IOP conditions compared to high IOP. In conclusion, survival of RGCs was more conducive under normal IOP conditions with significantly increased degeneration observed at high IOP. Thus, suggesting that elevated IOP could potentially create a microenvironment that would significantly inhibit successful transplantation of de novo RGCs.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We introduce the Basic Transient Hydrogen Bond (THB) model of the MR signal relaxation due to the quantum spin/magnetization exchanges within the THB Matrix encompassing water molecules and membrane-forming macromolecules.\n\nOur data show the existence of two THB Matrix components with distinct lifetimes - one in a few nano-second range, and another in the range of tens nanoseconds. Importantly, the former component facilitates longitudinal relaxation of MR signal, the latter contributes to its transverse relaxation and causes the anisotropy of MR signal relaxation. These distinct features offer opportunity to study nanoscale level microstructure of cellular membranes.

In fact, early anatomical tracing studies investigated the organization of hippocampal inputs to the LS and its hypothalamic outputs to begin to understand how its structure might relate to its function. These studies also characterized the cellular anatomy of the LS and the organization of different molecular markers within it. However, relatively little is known about the organization of other, non-hypothalamic projection populations within the LS and what types of input these different projection populations receive. Here, we used retrograde tracing to determine the organization of LS projections to six different brain regions that mediate various social behaviors. We found that these projection populations occupy discrete anatomical compartments within the LS. We then used a monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy to map brainwide inputs to these six discrete LS projection populations and examine how different brain regions innervate them. We identified unique region-dependent patterns of inputs to individual LS projection populations. In particular, we observed differences in cortical, hippocampal and thalamic innervation of the six different LS projection populations, while the hypothalamic inputs were largely similar across projection populations. Thus, this study provides insight into the anatomical connectivity that may underlie the functional heterogeneity of the LS.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we combined optimized single-nucleus RNA-seq with Slide-seqv2, a high-resolution spatial transcriptomics technology, to densely reconstruct the cellular processes that coordinate remyelination after a focal demyelinating injury. This revealed several findings: First, we found extensive transcriptional diversity of glia and monocyte-derived macrophages from demyelination to repair. Second, we identified a population of infiltrating peripheral lymphocytes--predominantly CD8 T-cells and natural killer cells--that are enriched specifically during remyelination. Third, we identified a concerted interferon-response gene signature that is shared across several cell types--microglia, astrocytes, and the oligodendrocyte lineage--just prior to reestablishment of myelin. These interferon-responsive glia (IRG) form clusters around remyelinating white matter and their formation is solely dependent on the type I interferon receptor. Functionally, we found that IRG secrete the cytokine CXCL10 which mediates infiltration of peripheral lymphocytes into the repairing white matter. Depletion of the most abundant infiltrating lymphocyte, CD8 T-cells, attenuated the differentiation of mature oligodendrocytes during remyelination. Together, our data reveals the diversity of glial-immune interactions that orchestrate white matter repair and a type I-dependent glial state that drives lymphocyte influx into damaged white matter to modulate oligodendrocyte differentiation.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=57 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/649486v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c32841org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@87dd70org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1daf9e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b00d9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, we have used intravital imaging and radioactive tracer studies, in combination with an exogenous inhibitor and a GAG-binding CXCL4 mutant, to demonstrate that CXCL4 can enter the brain parenchyma of mice by binding to proteoglycans within the cell surface of the endothelial glycocalyx of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that CXCL4 directly promotes neurogenesis in vitro, which is mediated by its ability to oligomerise and bind to GAGs. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for CXCL4 uptake and function within the brain.

However, contemplative traditions describe non-dual states where this distinction dissolves. Despite its significance, the neural basis of non-duality remains underexplored. Using psychological questionnaires for non-duality experience and EEG-based intrinsic neural timescales as measured by the autocorrelation window (ACW), we studied non-duality in advanced meditators, novice meditators, and controls. All subjects underwent breath-watching meditation (internal attention) and a visual oddball cognitive task (external attention); this allowed us to conceptualize non-duality as a lack of distinction between internal and external attention. Our key findings include: (a) advanced meditators report greater experience of non-duality during breath-watching (psychological scales), (b) EEG-based ACW is longer during internal attention (breath watch) than external attention (oddball task) in all subjects taken together, (c) advanced meditators show no such distinction with equal duration of their ACW during both internal and external attention (we replicated this finding in another dataset of expert meditators); (d) the advanced meditators internal-external ACW difference correlated with their experience of the degree of non-duality (psychological scales) during internal attention.

TranscriptFormer jointly models genes and transcripts using a novel generative architecture, enabling it to function as a virtual instrument for probing cellular biology. In zero-shot settings, our models demonstrate superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cell type classification, with robust performance even for species separated by over 685 million years of evolutionary distance. TranscriptFormer can also perform zero-shot disease state identification in human cells and accurately transfers cell type annotations across species boundaries. Being a generative model, TranscriptFormer can be prompted to predict cell type-specific transcription factors and gene-gene interactions that align with independent experimental observations.

Simulations of photon propagation through transcranial tissue captured key scattering and attenuation patterns, guiding the localization of light effects in vivo. Using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging and arterial spin labeling, we showed that tLS significantly increased blood oxygenation level-dependent signals and cerebral blood flow in the light-affected regions. These hemodynamic changes co-occurred with a reduction in cortical excitability, as revealed by electroencephalographic source reconstruction and transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked potentials. To probe the underlying mechanism, we incorporated inhibitory neural inputs into the computational NVU model. The model predicted that tLS enhances inhibitory neuronal activity and nitric oxide release, driving vasodilation and elevating metabolic support. These findings revealed that transcranial photons can differentially modulate neuronal and vascular components of the NVU--suppressing excitability while promoting perfusion--thereby suggesting a novel therapeutic avenue for targeting neurovascular dynamics in cognitive and clinical applications.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

So far, neuroimaging studies have mostly relied on high-level contrasts (e.g., meaningful > non-meaningful phrases) to identify brain regions sensitive to semantic composition. However, such an approach is less apt at addressing how composition is carried out, namely what functions best characterize the integration of constituent concepts. To address this limitation, we rely on simple computational models to explicitly characterize alternative compositional operations, and use representational similarity analysis to compare the representations of models to those of target regions of interest within the general semantic network. To better target composition beyond specific task demands, we re-analyze fMRI data aggregated from four published studies (N = 85), all employing two-word combinations but differing in task requirements. Converging evidence from confirmatory and exploratory analyses reveals compositional representations in the pars triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA45), even when analyses are restricted to a subset where the task did not require participants to actively engage in semantic processing. These results suggest that BA45 represents combinatorial information automatically across task demands, and further characterize these combinatorial representations as resulting from the (symmetric) intersection of constituent features. Additionally, a cluster of compositional representations emerges in the left middle superior temporal sulcus, while semantic, but not compositional, representations are observed in the left angular gyrus. Overall, our work clarifies which brain regions represent semantic information compositionally across different contexts and task demands, and qualifies which operations best describe composition.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Disparity tuning was strongest in the central portion of the visual field and transitioned from representing nearer to farther depths from the lower to upper visual field, respectively.

Given the role of type I IFNs in human disease, we sought to clarify the action of action of IFN- and IFN-{beta} on human DRG (hDRG) nociceptors. We found that IFN receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are functionally expressed by these neurons and their engagement induces canonical STAT1 signaling and non-canonical MAPK activation as measured by increased phosphorylation of the cap-binding protein eIF4E by MNK1/2 kinases. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, Ca2+-imaging, and multi-electrode arrays we demonstrate that IFN- and -{beta} increase the excitability of hDRG neurons with short (30 min) and long-term (24-48 h) exposure and prolong the duration of capsaicin responses, an effect that is blocked by inhibition of MNK1/2 with eFT508, a specific inhibitor of these kinases.

In these polarity-impaired cells, signaling mediated by the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase Ptp10D upon engagement with its ligand Sas in the surrounding wild-type cells triggers cell competition via EGFR pathway inhibition and JNK pathway activation, which induces apoptosis of the mutant cells. Here, we investigate whether directly triggering cytoskeletal deregulation (which usually occurs downstream of cell polarity disruptions) is sufficient to trigger their elimination by cell competition via the Sas-Ptp10D signaling system. We show that actin cytoskeleton deregulated cells (as induced by RhoGEF2 overexpression (RhoGEF2OE)) are eliminated when surrounded by wild-type cells, and that Ptp10D knockdown increases RhoGEF2OE clone growth, revealing the importance of Ptp10D in the elimination of RhoGEF2OE cells. Mechanistically, in clones that are moderately overexpressing RhoGEF2OE, Ptp10D knockdown rescued cell elimination by reducing Hippo signaling. In this setting, JNK and EGFR-Ras signaling were not affected (in contrast to what occurs in apico-basal mutant cells), suggesting that Sas-Ptp10D may regulate the Hippo pathway directly in RhoGEF2OE cells. We also found that mutations in the apical cell polarity protein, Crb, partially rescued the elimination of RhoGEF2OE clones, showing that Crb normally plays a role in RhoGEF2OE clone elimination. In this setting, in which RhoGEF2OE is highly overexpressed, JNK and Hippo signaling were elevated while EGFR-Ras signaling was reduced, and crb loss normalized these pathways. crb mutant cells also showed reduced abundance of and apical membrane localization of Ptp10D, suggesting that Crb may play an important role in Sas-Ptp10D mediated cell competition. Thus, actin cytoskeleton deregulation, caused by RhoGEF2OE, results in clone elimination dependent on Crb, Ptp10D, and Hippo signaling. Altogether, our results reveal that Ptp10D is acting more broadly in cell competition to trigger the elimination of actin cytoskeleton deregulated loser cells, as well as polarity-impaired cells.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

However, this perspective may miss a crucial aspect of tumor resilience, particularly in cancers driven by extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Rather than evolving at the individual level, ecDNA-driven cancers may operate on a population scale, where graded variation in oncogene copy numbers across cells enhances the adaptability of the entire tumor cell population. Leveraging single cell multi-omics sequencing and machine learning, we demonstrate that cell-to-cell variation in ecDNA copy number scales directly with functional phenotypes, including gene expression, chromatin accessibility, protein levels, cell cycle distributions and growth. For the first time, we show that when this graded variation is disrupted, cells rapidly restore it, far faster than random ecDNA segregation would allow. Time-course experiments and computational simulations suggest that the inheritance of ecDNAs into daughter cells is governed by active, deterministic processes. Our findings position ecDNA as a key driver of population-level adaptability, challenging the view of ecDNA as a mere byproduct of genomic instability. Instead, ecDNA forms the foundation of selection processes that enhance the tumor's ability to evolve and survive in dynamic environments. This population-based adaptability makes ecDNA-driven cancers exceptionally resilient, offering new insights into their persistence and therapeutic resistance.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

EXTRNA revealed both tissue-type-specific expression programs (\"tRNAomes\") and unexpected intra-tissue heterogeneity across breast cancer samples. Integrating EXTRNA with computational network analysis and data from other publicly available datasets, we identified Zinc Finger ZZ-Type And EF-Hand Domain Containing 1 (ZZEF1) as the first sequence-specific transcription factor of a particular tRNA. ZZEF1 promoted tRNA-LysUUU transcription by partnering with the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 6 (CHD6), enhancing chromatin accessibility at tRNA-Lys-TTT-3 loci. ZZEF1 deficiency reduced tRNA-LysUUU abundance, decreased the translational efficiency of AAR codon-enriched mRNAs-including the tumor suppressor Serine/Threonine Kinase 3 (STK3)-and promoted metastatic progression in breast cancer in vivo.

With this objective, we intended to identify the potential therapeutic tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRs) in OSCC. In a previous work from our laboratory, we treated OSCC cells with 5-Azacytidine, a global DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and subsequently performed a microRNA microarray analysis and identified 50 upregulated miRs. Of these, miR-631 that had no previously known roles in OSCC was selected for the further analysis in the present study. Our experiments show that miR-631 reduces proliferation of OSCC cells and binds to the 3UTR of the oncogene RAB11A and reduces its expression at both the transcript and protein levels. The upregulation of miR-631 is shown to be due to its promoter demethylation after the 5-Azacytidine treatment. We demonstrate that miR-631 inhibits proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and increases apoptosis of OSCC cells, in part, via targeting RAB11A. The inverse correlation in the levels of miR-631 and RAB11A in various cancer cell lines and in a majority (58.33%) of OSCC patient samples suggests the biological relevance of their interaction. The nude mice OSCC xenograft study suggests the tumor suppressive nature of miR-631. Further, miR-631 and RAB11A interaction reduces the Wnt signaling in OSCC.

To address this, we used cell-free cotranslational insertion of full-length human Beta1AR into nanodiscs and determined its cryo-EM structure in complex with Gs. In this structure, ICL3 extends transmembrane helix 5, resulting in enhanced interactions with Galphas and in a slight rotation of the engaged G protein. This repositioning enables new polar interactions between Galphas, ICL2 and helix 8, while ICL1 and helix 8 form additional contacts with Gbeta. These structural insights, supported by mutational analysis, demonstrate that ICL3 enhances G protein activation and downstream cAMP signaling by promoting more extensive interactions between the receptor and the heterotrimeric G protein.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes a photosensitizer and light to generate cytotoxic reactive species that are efficacious against bacteria. We sought to determine whether PDT could effectively eliminate bacteria isolated from the peritoneal cavities of pediatric patients with perforated appendicitis. Hypothesis: In monoculture planktonic samples, PDT achieves a minimum of 99.9% bacterial cell kill (3 log10 growth reduction per mL). Methods: After IRB approval, bacterial subcultures from 30 pediatric surgical patients with PA were developed as planktonic monocultures. Samples were derived from standard clinical collection of peritoneal fluid in patients undergoing surgery for PA. Cultures were incubated with the photosensitizer methylene blue (MB) and exposed to a 665 nm laser to perform PDT. Control conditions were MB alone, laser alone, or no MB and no laser. Log reductions in bacterial growth between groups were compared using two-way ANOVA. Results: Bacteria were isolated from 28 (93.3%) specimens, and 26 (86.7%) were polymicrobial. The most prevalent organisms included Escherichia coli (76.7%), the Streptococcus anginosus group (56.7%), Bacteroides fragilis (46.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.7%), with antibiotic resistance common among E. coli isolates. For E. coli, MB-PDT caused a 5.86 +/- 0.39 log10 reduction compared to the no-treatment control (p<0.001). For S. anginosus and P. aeruginosa, MB-PDT resulted in reductions of 5.91 +/- 0.88 log10 and 2.23 +/- 0.64 log10, respectively (all p<0.001). PDT showed comparable efficacy in isolates with multiple antibiotic resistance relative to those that were antibiotic pan-susceptible for E. coli (p=0.760), S. anginosus group (p>0.999), and P. aeruginosa (p=0.991). Conclusions: PDT application to bacterial isolates from patients with perforated appendicitis achieved >99.9% bacterial kill in all isolated strains other than P. aeruginosa, regardless of antibiotic susceptibility, suggesting that PDT may be a viable adjunct to in vivo antimicrobial therapy.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We used a model system of the ubiquitous microalga Emiliania huxleyi and its giant virus, E. huxleyi virus (EhV), to study how resistant populations evolve and to identify their transcriptional programs. We generated a detailed temporal transcriptomic dataset during a viral infection, covering the stages of lysis and the recovery of a resistant subpopulation. Viral infection triggered prominent transcriptome changes to support viral propagation, followed by a unique transcriptional response in resistant cells. Both infected and resistant cells highly expressed innate immune response genes, notably those with Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains. Additionally, resistant cells expressed genes involved in membrane-bound glycan remodeling, sphingolipid metabolism, and nutrient uptake.

As part of the development of new drugs, several molecular modeling tools such as docking, virtual screening and molecular dynamics were combined with databases to decipher potential inhibitors of coronavirus targets. We performed a structure-based design of antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins 3 and 5 (nsp3 and nsp5) based on a high-throughput virtual screening of the ZINC15 database tranches for ligand docking followed by click chemistry with a particular attention paid to relaxed structures mimicking potential in vivo interactions.

Although both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, Amb929 displayed the most efficient anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Among these two drugs, Amb929 was less cytotoxic compared to Amb701, demonstrating an optimal anti-SARS-CoV-2 response with a high selectivity index in cell culture and a high inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication compared to untreated condition on a model of human airway epithelium (HAE), paving the way for the development of drugs with very potent anti-coronavirus activity.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

As the initial interface between the environment and the insect olfactory system, odorant binding proteins (OBPs) solubilize and transport hydrophobic odorant molecules from the sensillar lymph to olfactory receptors. Recently, evidence has suggested that OBPs may also sequester excess harmful molecules such as insecticides in the perireceptor space, preventing them from reaching vulnerable olfactory sensory neuronal dendrites. In this study, we identified an antenna-specific OBP (LdecOBP33) that is 2.5-fold higher expressed in a neonicotinoid resistant strain than the susceptible one. Competitive displacement fluorescence binding assays revealed that LdecOBP33 protein binds to a wide range of compounds including various plant volatiles and insecticides. Next, we used RNA interference to knock down LdecOBP33 and combined with toxicological bioassays, behavioral, and electrophysiological assays to investigate functions of LdecOBP33 in insecticide resistance and host location. We found that LdecOBP33 silencing increased susceptibility of male beetles to imidacloprid, suggesting its role in insecticide resistance. Additionally, LdecOBP33 aids in host location through enhancing the detection of stress-induced potato plant volatiles, increasing the efficacy of CPB adult foraging. Taken together, our study is the first to functionally characterize an OBP in CPB linked to insecticide resistance and host location. Our findings provide insight into a key molecular factor involved in CPB response to environmental challenges, suggesting a potential link between insect adaptation to xenobiotics and olfactory processing.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We have mapped genetic loci that modulate age-specific mortality using a new actuarial method. We started with 6,438 pubescent mice and ended with a survivorship of 559 mice that lived to at least 1100 days of age. Twenty-nine Vita loci dynamically modulate lifespan and have strong age-delimited effects after correction for multiple tests. Fourteen loci have relatively steady but genotype-dependent effects on mortality from pubescence to old age and are candidate aging rate modulators. Other loci act most forcefully over shorter periods of life, and the polarities of their genetic effects often invert with age and differ by sex. We detect 41 epistatic interactions among these Vita loci, all exclusive to males or females, and with strong signatures of sexual reciprocity. A distinct set of 19 Soma loci shape the negative correlation between larger body size in young adults with their subsequent life expectancies. These loci are direct evidence that antagonistic pleiotropy modulates mortality early in life. Another set of 11 Soma loci shape the positive correlation between heavier body weight at older ages and longer life expectancies.

The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. Despite being indispensable for sex determination, we detected low levels of amhy expression throughout early development. This indicates the mechanism of sex determination is likely unrelated to overall dosage of amhy and its autosomal paralog, amha. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. The creation of sex reversed lines allow us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both Y-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the four core genotypes model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, its subcellular localization remains ambiguous. We investigated its intracellular trafficking using diverse approaches. In C2C12 myoblasts, fluorescent protein-tagged Bcnt/Cfdp1 was predominantly localized within the nucleus, preferentially in regions of low DAPI density in myoblasts, and the localization persisted in differentiated multinucleated myotubes. Conversely, detergent-based biochemical fractionation of C2C12 and HEK293T cells indicated a substantial presence of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in cytoplasmic fractions. Quantitative proteomic analysis of fractionated proteins revealed that six IDPs, including a PEST-containing nuclear protein, demonstrated similar distribution patterns to Bcnt/Cfdp1; despite being annotated as nuclear proteins, they were detected in cytoplasmic fractions. Direct treatment of both cell lines with digitonin enabled the collection of released proteins in three steps to accurately isolate cytoplasmic proteins. Bcnt/Cfdp1 exhibited distinct extraction patterns compared to cytoplasmic soluble protein extracts in Ficoll/sucrose solution, while no differences were noted when cells underwent digitonin treatment in an isotonic solution. Quantitative proteomic analysis of these extracts highlighted the mobility or integrity of each protein within the cytoplasm. Consequently, although Bcnt/Cfdp1 is essential within the nucleus, our findings suggest its additional presence in the cytoplasm.

Here, we show that cells expressing SIRT4(H161Y), a catalytically inactive, dominant-negative mutant of SIRT4, fail to upregulate LC3B-II and show a reduced autophagic flux upon treatment with different inducers of mitophagy/autophagy, i.e., CoCl2-triggered pseudohypoxia, CCCP/oligomycin-mediated respiratory chain inhibition, or rapamycin treatment. Interestingly, SIRT4(H161Y) expression (i) upregulated protein levels of HDAC6, which is involved in mitochondrial trafficking and autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and (ii) inhibited the conversion of OPA1-L to OPA1-S, which is associated with increased mitochondrial fusion and decreased mitophagy. Both HDAC6 and OPA1 are SIRT4 interactors. However, pharmacological inhibition of neither HDAC6 via Tubacin nor OPA1 via MYLS22 reversed the stress-induced upregulation of LC3B-II levels upon autophagy/mitophagy treatment of SIRT4(H161Y)-expressing cells. Remarkably, inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and thus disruption of late autophagic flux by BafA1 treatment also failed to restore LC3B-II levels upon autophagy/mitophagy treatment, suggesting an inhibitory effect of SIRT4(H161Y) on the initiation/early phase of autophagy. Consistent with this idea, we show that SIRT4(H161Y) promoted the phosphorylation of ULK1 at S638 and S758 (mTORC1 targets), both of which mediate an important inhibitory regulation of autophagy initiation. Thus, our data suggest a positive regulatory function of SIRT4, presumably via modulation of AMPK/mTORC1 signaling, in the ULK1-dependent early regulation/initiation of stress-induced autophagic flux.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses of three Pt-oxidizing enzymes: the native Pt oxidase phosphite dehydrogenase (PtxD), and two promiscuous Pt oxidases, alkaline phosphatase (AP) and carbon-phosphorus (CP) lyase. Among these, AP was found to be widely distributed across bacteria since the early stages of their evolution. In contrast, PtxD emerged later in a limited number of bacterial lineages that had lost AP. Our biochemical characterizations revealed that most extant and reconstructed ancestral APs tested exhibited Pt oxidation activity.

However, current computational tools for oligonucleotide design face significant limitations, including difficulties in processing long DNA sequences, poor adaptability to specific experimental conditions, limited control over oligonucleotide length, and challenges in minimising spurious dimer formation. To address these issues, we developed CertPrime, an innovative tool designed for scalable and efficient handling of long DNA sequences. CertPrime enables precise customisation of experimental parameters, provides flexibility to limit the maximum oligonucleotide length, and generates designs with reduced deviations in melting temperatures across overlapping regions compared to existing tools. We experimentally compared CertPrime designs with benchmark design methods for a complex DNA sequence and found that CertPrime design led to more efficient gene assembly, significantly reducing the occurrence of non-specific bands. These results make CertPrime a powerful and versatile tool for oligonucleotide design in gene synthesis applications.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

V.; Balkin, A. S.; Dilbaryan, D. S.; Vasilchenko, A. S.", "abstract": "An important aspect of studying potential antibacterial biopreparations for crop protection is determining their potential negative impacts on the environment. Plant-associated Bacillus velezensis produce macrolactin A (McA), which determine effectiveness of this bacterial species against numerous human and plant pathogens. However, the effects of McA on the soil microbiome and the selection of specific antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among soil bacteria remain unknown. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing-based metagenomic methods to investigate the differences in structure of the soil bacterial community and the abundance and diversity of ARGs in both McA-treated and untreated samples. The presence of high (10 mg per kg soil) and low (1 mg per kg soil) concentrations of McA induced changes in soil bacterial populations as shown by taxonomic analysis. The relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria significantly increased under the McA treatments, while the relative abundance of Thermoleophilia, Rubrobacteria, Planctomycetia and Acidimicrobiia decreased. The ARG profiling results showed that both low and high doses of McA affected ARGs representation in the community. At the same time, a low dose of McA altered the representation of a larger number of ARGs (7 genes) compared to a high dose (3 genes). Overall, exposure to McA consistently altered the abundance of genes associated with resistance to elfamycin, glycopeptide, fluoroquinolone, rifampicin, and macrolide. Correlation analysis identified 185 relationships between 52 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and 34 bacterial genera. Among these bacteria, Streptomyces, Baekduia, and Capillimicrobium were predicted to carry the most diverse ARGs. By assembling and annotating bacterial genomes, we identified the true hosts of ARGs. Chloroflexota were the most prevalent phylum harboring ARGs. Furthermore, profiling the soil microbiome's metabolic potential under low-dose McA revealed increased abundance of genes associated with signaling, chemotaxis, and broad-substrate drug efflux. The collectively obtained data significantly expands the understanding of the functional role of McA in the ecology of Bacillus velezensis, and at the same time provides an assessment of environmental risks associated with the use of biopreparations containing metabolites or living cells of this species' bacteria.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

However, there is evidence of willow and pine tree growth in these terrains, which is unexpected given the extreme conditions of this environment. Considering the importance of plants in restoration strategies, the objective of this study was to analyze the effect that willow and pine growth have on the heavy metal contents of their surrounding soil, and the abundance, interaction, metabolic profile and assembly of the bacterial community. In the Cauquenes tailing, we collected samples from willow and pine vegetated soils as well as the surrounding non-vegetated soils. We analyzed characteristics such as heavy metal concentrations and pH levels in all sampled soils, and in tree leaves and roots. Vegetated sites exhibited lower copper levels and a neutral pH, while both tree species accumulated heavy metals in their tissues. We also determined bacterial abundance in all soil samples, and co-occurrence networks were constructed to assess bacterial interactions. Both trees promoted a higher abundance of Proteobacteria and had networks with higher modularity compared to non-vegetated soils. Finally, we estimated the metabolic profile of the bacterial community using PICRUSt 2 analysis and determined carbon source utilization with BioLog Ecoplates. PICRUSt 2 predicted higher metabolic activity in vegetated soils, and BioLog Ecoplate analysis revealed the utilization of a greater number of carbon sources. The microbial communities from vegetated soils were assembled in a deterministic manner, while the community from non-vegetated soils were stochastically assembled. In conclusion, tree growth mitigated the extreme conditions of the tailing and promoted a more active and healthier bacterial community.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Although most efforts have focused on aerobic granular sludge, conventional activated sludge systems, which account for most global wastewater treatment, remain underexploited for EPS recovery. Building on the established link between oxidative stress and EPS biosynthesis in pure strains, we propose that strategically manipulating oxygen exposure patterns to intensify oxidative stress in activated sludge microbial communities could enhance EPS production. To test this, we applied continuous oxygen perturbation under aerobic exposure to intensify oxidative stress. Compared to a stable oxygen condition simulating typical wastewater aeration, the perturbation considerably enhanced EPS yield to 74.4mg/L/day, a 90.5% increase over the stable condition (39.0mg/L/day). To validate the role of oxidative stress in EPS enhancement, intermittent anoxic phases were introduced into the perturbation pattern to relieve oxidative stress, causing the EPS-enhancing effect to disappear, with yield dropping to 9.8mg/L/day. Mechanistically, intensified oxidative stress under aerobic continuous perturbation was primarily driven by elevated reducing substrates for non-respiratory flavoenzymes, exemplified by glutamate synthase, glutathione reductase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, which are prone to generate H2O2 as an unintended metabolic byproduct. Among the multiple microbial groups contributing to H2O2 production, Methylophilaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae were distinguished by simultaneously exhibiting upregulation of EPS biosynthesis proteins, suggesting that taxa within these families collectively mediated both H2O2 production and EPS enhancement. By modulating aeration, this study offers a chemical-free, controllable strategy for enhancing EPS production within conventional activated sludge systems.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

To better understand host responses to typhoid toxin, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of intoxicated host cells and found that the toxin induced expression of genes relating to the type-I interferon response, including the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15. ISG15 was upregulated in a STING-dependent manner, reduced bacterial burden, and was found to be critical to host cell survival in response to the typhoid toxin and purified interferon.

USUV RNA has been identified in wild birds and mosquito populations, and exposure of captive birds to USUV at Zoological Society of London (ZSL) has also been confirmed. Since its first detection in London, USUV's distribution has expanded across the South East, highlighting a need to understand the transmission dynamics of this virus in the UK. The primary vectors of USUV in the UK are likely Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Two biotypes have been identified, the bird-feeding Cx. pipiens pipiens and Cx. pipiens molestus which shows no restriction in host preference. The latter may play an important role in transmitting USUV from birds to humans. Methods: A laboratory colony of Cx. pipiens molestus mosquitoes were orally infected with the London strain of USUV and, incubated at 22 {ring}C, 20 {ring}C and 18{ring}C for up to 28 days. Body samples and mosquito saliva samples were collected and analysed using a quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR to determine infection and transmission potential, respectively. Results: USUV RNA was detected in all sample times at all temperatures assessed; with the highest temperature (22 {ring}C) showing the greatest proportion of saliva and body positive samples. At this temperature, there was also an eight-fold increase in the relative viral copy number in the mosquito bodies, which was unobserved at other experimental temperatures. When a more sensitive PCR assay was used at the lowest experimental temperature used (18 {ring}C) USUV RNA was present in the mosquito saliva and body samples for longer and showed a greater proportion of positive samples when compared to 20 {ring}C. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that Cx. pipiens molestus may be able to transmit USUV at 22 {ring}C. Active replication of USUV was identified in the mosquito bodies at 22 {ring}C but could not be demonstrated at lower temperatures, suggesting that 20 {ring}C to 22 {ring}C may be an important temperature threshold in USUV replication and transmission. Utilisation of a more sensitive assay for the lower experimental temperatures revealed that USUV was detectable at 18 {ring}C. Therefore, when conducting infection studies on temperate mosquito-borne viruses, it is important to consider assay sensitivity.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

We report novel functions for two RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) in Paramecium in the detection of exogenous RNA. In the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism, RDRs are normally involved in the production of large amounts of secondary siRNAs in response to an initial primary siRNA. To characterize the function of RDRs in context of exogenous RNA recognition, we developed a novel dsRNA delivery system using dextran nanoparticles to deliver heteroduplex dsRNA to cells as food particles, mimicking the natural phagosomal entry pathway. Subsequent small RNA sequencing allows us to dissect siRNAs produced from exogenous RNA or RDR transcripts. Contrary to expectations of how dsRNAinduced silencing is triggered, our data show that Dicer is unable to directly cleave exogenous dsRNA while two RDRs are required for the initial steps of dsRNA-induced RNAi. Paradoxically, these two RDRs must replicate dsRNA to make it available for Dicer cleavage and primary siRNA accumulation. Our data also show that this system works efficiently also with exogenous ssRNA, although RDR2 is dispensable for ssRNA conversion. The function of RDRs in this protist is in contrast to that in animals, plants and fungi and extends the functional diversity of these polymerases. RDR-associated complexes appear to control the entry of food and symbiont-derived RNA into the RNAi machinery, enabling complex RNA interactions with the environment.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

Our analysis identifies and validates gene clusters - including nearly all known and several novel genes - linked to non-homologous end-joining, 53BP1 sub-pathways, homology-directed repair, and polymerase Theta (POLQ)-mediated end-joining. By focusing on pathway-specific repair outcomes, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for the WRN helicase in suppressing inverted templated insertions, a poorly understood POLQ-associated mutational signature also found in human disease alleles. Furthermore, in-depth analysis of MUSIC's scar features reveals unexpected distinctions among genes within the same pathway, providing mechanistic insight and opening multiple new avenues for investigation into chromosomal break repair.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

To interrogate sequence-level drivers of rG4 folding, we applied a reverse-transcriptase stop sequencing strategy to a library of ~3,000 synthetic rG4s with varied G-tract lengths, loop lengths, and loop compositions, permitting massively parallel quantification of rG4 stability. Our data confirm known sequence-level features and characterize novel combinatorial impacts of these features. We also assessed systematically mutagenized natural rG4s, revealing unexpected mutations that significantly affect rG4 stability, including contributions from flanking sequences outside of the rG4. We further used our strategy to assess rG4 recognition preferences of the model rG4-ligand pyridostatin, revealing a preferential stabilization of rG4s containing mixed-length G-tracts. We further demonstrated the potential for large-scale protein binding assays with our library to reveal rG4 features recognized by RBPs, specifically G3BP1 and FMRP.

While non-allophanic Andosols are characterized by high organic C content and strong P retention, the effects of different soil P fertility levels on C dynamics in these soils remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a 20-day incubation experiment using 13C-enriched glucose to investigate how different soil P levels (Truog-P: 157 mg P kg-1 and 12 mg P kg-1) impacted microbial C dynamics in non-allophanic Andosols under different field management practices. Our results showed that soil organic matter (SOM) priming strongly depends on soil P levels, although total primed CO2-C emissions were low in these soils. The addition of glucose alone promoted positive PEs compared to the addition of glucose with nitrogen (N). In high P soils, glucose and N addition resulted in negative PEs, whereas in low P soils, the same treatment stimulated microbial SOM mining, resulting in positive PEs. Additionally, higher CUE was found in high P soils than in low P soils after 20 days of incubation. These findings suggest that soil P levels influence both substrate-induced microbial assimilation and SOM decomposition. In P-limited soils, microbial P requirements drive SOM decomposition, which in turn regulates CUE. This study contributes to an understanding of the role of P in soil C cycling and provides insights into soil fertility management strategies for improving C sequestration in non-allophanic Andosols.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": ""}

While A. baumannii can acquire environmental DNA through multiple mechanisms including natural competence, one of the most common is acquisition via plasmids by conjugation. One of the challenges for conjugation is an active Type VI Secretion System (T6SS), which kills nonkin bacteria and therefore inhibits the conjugation. The acquisition of resistance genes has helped the spread of resistant clones of A. baumannii. The most prominently disseminated clones belong to specific sequence types [(ST), Pasteur scheme], namely ST1, ST2, ST10, ST15, ST25, ST79 and ST85 with the ST2 being the most detected ST. While ST1 and ST2 were thoroughly studied, there are new emerging clones whose genetic background facilitating the rise is still unknown or poorly understood. One of the rising clones is A. baumannii ST19, recently reported to be frequently occurring in Georgia and Ukraine. In this study, we have whole-genome sequenced three isolates of A. baumannii ST19 which were then assessed for biofilm production and virulence in the Galleria mellonella in vivo infection model. Further 156 A. baumannii ST19 genomes were obtained from public repositories.
